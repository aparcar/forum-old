					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>i obviously destroyed my router.</p><p>I had an dd-wrt installed on it and tried to switch to openwrt.<br />The documentation said, i&#039;ve got flash first stock and afterwards openwrt itself.</p><p>So i copied TL-WR1043ND-V1-FW0.0.3-stripped.bin to dd-wrt and tried to write it by mtd to the hardware.<br />It started flashing and after a while it restarted.....and only the power led was lid....no blinking...nothing.</p><p>I also connected a serial console meanwhile....but it seems it doesnt even finds a clean bootloader; it loops here:<br />U-Boot 1.1.4 (Apr 28 2013 - 16:01:02)</p><p>AP83 (ar9100) U-boot 0.0.11<br />DRAM:&nbsp; <br />sri<br />32 MB<br />id read 0x100000ff<br />flash size 8MB, sector count = 128<br />Flash:&nbsp; 8 MB<br />�</p><p>So ...does anybody have a better solution than desolder the hardware? the openwrt wiki also says theres no debrick by JTAG.....</p><p>I would be thankfull for any help......</p><p>cheerio,</p><p>soralanthanas</p>									</div>

					<p>You can most likely debrick via JTAG:</p><p>See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/debrick.ath79.using.jtag">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/de … using.jtag</a></p><p>I used this method successfully with the Buffalo G300NH <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h</a> -- which is the same ar91xx platform as the WR1043ND. </p><p>Also see my related post here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=320240#p320240">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 40#p320240</a> and some more posts in this thread.</p><br /><p>For the ch341a, I tried this with a TPLink WDR3600, but it was not working with the in-line programming clip. It&#039;s actually quite easy to de-solder the 8pin Flash-Chip there. I just used a lot of excess tin-solder and thin enamel-wire to lift up the chip while heating up the tin-solder with the iron. <br />Might be worth a shot even with 16pins...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>freezer2k</strong> on 22 Jul 2016, 03:57)</p>
