					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have some questions about the configuration of <strong>hostapd</strong> and <strong>VLANs</strong> on an OpenWRT device.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a very expert user of OpenWRT so please correct me if I say something wrong. I&#039;ll try to explain my scenario as clear as possible. The configuration I want to set up is the following:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s6.postimage.org/sjyif2441/vlan_scenario.png" alt="Scenario" /></span><br />in which the device is configured as an AP with two SSIDs. Each SSID is on a different VLAN, while the wired interface is in trunking mode. To achieve this behavior I performed the following steps:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>I configured hostapd in order to create two SSIDs</p></li><li><p>I created two vlan interfaces (2,3) on the wired interface</p></li><li><p>I created one vlan interface for each wireless interface (2 for wlan0, and 3 for wlan1)</p></li><li><p>I created two bridges, one for each vid and I added to them the corresponding vlan interfaces</p></li></ol><p>The hostapd conf file is the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ieee80211n=1
ht_capab=[HT20]
channel=36
macaddr_acl=0
ssid=SSID1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
bss=wlan1
ssid=SSID2
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0</code></pre></div><p>and the commands I used are:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vconfig add eth0 2
vconfig add eth0 3

vconfig add wlan0 2
vconfig add wlan1 3

brctl addbr br.vlan2
brctl addbr br.vlan3

brctl addif br.vlan2 eth0.2
brctl addif br.vlan2 wlan0.2

brctl addif br.vlan3 eth0.3
brctl addif br.vlan3 wlan1.3</code></pre></div><p>The result is the following configuration:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s6.postimage.org/cvxb89oi9/vlan_configuration_1.png" alt="VLAN configuration" /></span><br />and everything worked as expected! Packets that comes to <em>eth0</em> with VID=2 are sent out from <em>wlan0</em> with VID=2 and packets that comes to <em>eth0</em> with VID=3 are sent from <em>wlan1</em> with VID=3. This is exactly what I wanted. </p><p>Now suppose that I would like to configure one of the stations connected to SSID1 as a bridge as well. The only way to achieve this is putting its wireless interface in <strong>4address</strong> mode and forcing hostapd to work in <strong>WDS</strong> mode (<em>wds_sta=1</em> in the conf file).&nbsp; It is here that problems come out. While working in WDS mode hostapd automatically creates a new interface (e.g. <em>wlan0.sta1, wlan0.sta2, ...</em>) for each station that connects to it, in fact (I guess) the <em>wds_sta</em> option is thought to be used together with the <em>bridge</em> option. This way each new interface (e.g. <em>wlan0.sta1</em>) is automatically bridged with the main interface (e.g. <em>wlan0</em>). My question is: <strong>how can I configure VLANs on interfaces like <em>wlan0.sta1</em>?</strong> In order to achieve the same behavior as the previous example I should do something like:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s6.postimage.org/q1ctedidt/vlan_configuration_wds.png" alt="VLAN with WDS" /></span><br />As far as I know, hostapd is not able to do this by itself. I should create VLANs on WDS interfaces by myself if I had a way to configure a hook on the <em>&quot;new station connected&quot;</em> event. Is there a way to do that?</p><p>Thanks.<br />Gaetano.</p>									</div>
