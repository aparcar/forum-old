					<p>I used the following link to build a link for my box (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/easy.build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/easy.build</a>). I substituted my router (ramips/rt288x/) for the ar71xx and Barrier_Breaker for AA.</p><p>Everything followed the script, but when it was time to execute &quot;make oldconfig&quot;, I did not get the option to specify my router. No choice was offered. In the example, the user was to &#039;y&#039; at question 63. The make oldconfig step took milliseconds to execute.</p><p>After &quot;make V=s&quot; (and ~30 minutes), my /bin directory was populated with the same files as <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ramips/rt288x/,">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … s/rt288x/,</a> but my MD5s did not match those on the site.</p><p>I was hoping to have a openwrt-ramips-rt288x-wli-tx4-ag300n-squashfs-FACTORY,bin file, but the closest was openwrt-ramips-rt288x-wli-tx4-ag300n-squashfs-SYSUPGRADE.bin file.</p><p>Since I performed the &#039;downloaded the package files&#039; steps, my openwrt directory is 7.3GB.</p><p>Can someone tell me where I went wrong?<br />* No choice at &#039;make oldconfig&#039;<br />* different md5s<br />* no &#039;factory&#039; file</p><p>The router is a Buffalo WLI-TX4-AG300N Airstation. I am trying to load openwrt files via the OEM software Firmware Update page.</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>									</div>

					<p>The advice about make oldconfig sounds a bit strange, when you are doing a new build.<br />1) Delete .config<br />2) do &quot;make menuconfig&quot; and select your architecture (ramips) and then the router. Exit menuconfig and save changes.</p><p>MD5 values are build-specific. You will never get the same values as the official build.</p><p>EDIT: <br />I am not sure if your architecture/router uses separate factory/sysupgrade files. That may depend on the embedded flash routine&#039;s checksum checks. There are no factory.img files for rt288x here: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ramips/rt288x/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … ps/rt288x/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 12 Oct 2014, 21:12)</p>

					<p>hnyman,</p><p>Thanks. I&#039;ve been building using your tips.</p><p>As of now, nothing has worked, but I&#039;m still trying! Lots of sysupgrade files on the website, but no factory files, so I believe what you&#039;re telling me is correct.</p>									</div>

					<p>So end up building 2 different ways and no luck. Amazing there&#039;s *support* for this router, but no one has ever loaded openwrt on it.</p><p>I&#039;m done trying.</p>									</div>
