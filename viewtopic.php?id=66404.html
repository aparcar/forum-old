					<p>I have two devices, TP-LINK TL-WR840N v9 and TL-WR941ND v5. Both of them have OpenWRT 15.05.1. I see CPU and ports 1–4 in the Switch menu. But if I add a VLAN to an interface – for example, with id 6 – and ‘save &amp; apply’, I can see LuCI saving firewall changes, and that spinning wheel. It spins and spins, meanwhile I cannot ping the router any more. It doesn’t show any signs that it reboots, its leds flash as usual, the link led of the port my laptop is connected to, flashes too. </p><p>I cannot ping neither the 192.168.1.1, nor 192.168.6.1, which I assigned to the VLAN interface. To check this I’ve set up the same VLAN on my laptop ethernet card. If I reboot the router and listen the interfaces on my laptop, that should be connected to the router, there’s a short time when it checks for BOOTP and then – silence. Only igmp queries once per minute. </p><p>I do not touch VLAN 1. I’ve tried to mark as tagged for VLAN 6<br /></p><ul><li><p>all five ports;</p></li><li><p>only the CPU port –that should be the switch, if I understand right;</p></li><li><p>only the port I am currently connected to;</p></li><li><p>only another port that I am not connected to;</p></li></ul><p>the result is the same: I cannot ping the router from any port, on any address it should have.</p><p>eth0 on my laptop has address 192.168.1.2/24 and eth0.6 has 192.168.6.2/24, while the LAN bridge on the router has 192.168.1.1/24 (default), and the other interface I created specifically for router’s VLAN is assigned 192.168.6.1/24.</p><p>I thought, maybe I was doing something wrong, but I’ve read and watched several guides, and in all of them the setup of VLANs looks pretty simple and straightforward. So am I doing something wrong, or I’m just unlucky with my hardware?</p>									</div>

So I can only provide you with the diff from LuCI.</p><p>Here I destroyed the LAN bridge and made it only ‘LAN’ interface. ‘LAN’ means eth1 in this case. The sixth VLAN on eth1 I joined with wireless interface to a new bridge. The whole purpose of this setup is making AP for guests, I’ve created 6th VLAN on the office router and started a separate DHCP server there, AP should be accessible for management from the office LAN, i.e. via eth1, but the guests should only go to the sixth VLAN.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/v8qdQNl.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/v8qdQNl.png" /></span></p>									</div>
