					<p>Hi,<br />I’m curently working on WPS ( : wifi positionning system). The purpose is to localize a wireless device (for me it’s a robot, but it can be a smartphone or a laptop), in a wireless network.</p><p>How it works: The network is built with 5 acces points, connected to a computer. The robot moves in this network. Every 1 second, the robot sends a UDP frame with the emission date. All the AP have to receive this frame, compute the signal strength, and send a new UDP frame to the computer, contening “the emission date from the robot”, “the reception date at the AP”, “the signal strength at the AP”, “the AP mac address”. Then the computer can compute the location of the robot by triangulation.</p><p>The problem is that AP’s can’t provide the signal strength. So I think I sould replace the APs by some TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND routers and to install OpenWRT.</p><p>So my question is : is it possible to configure the TL-WR1043ND router + OpenWRT to receive the frame sent by the robot, compute the signal strength, and to send a new UDP frame contening {“the emission date from the robot”, “the reception date at the AP”, “the signal strength at the AP”, “the AP mac address”} to the computer?</p><p>By advance thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your answer, Orca.</p><p>I know that whith the TL-WR1043ND router I can’t have acces to the signal strength (with the official firmware), but I can get it with OpenWRT using the command “wl rssi &lt;mac&gt;”. </p><p>Also I know (in C) how to get a UDP frame, slpit the frame and use it. I also know how to send a UDP frame.</p><p>The only thing I don’t know is if it is possible (and how to do this) to run a routine in the router with OpenWRT. This routine should listen a specific port, split the messages, and send a new message.</p><p>I think I am able to write the routine myself, but I don&#039;t know where, and how to put this routine in the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>&quot;wl rssi ...&quot; is a command related to the proprietary broadcom driver, for ath9k (which is used on the 1043ND) you need speak nl80211 in order to obtain per-peer signals.</p><p>Actually it should be even easier, you can just spawn a monitor interface and receive radiotap annotated wireless frames, the &quot;iwcap.c&quot; utility I recently added to trunk might give you some inspiration in implementing an appropriate listener routine:</p><p>&nbsp; <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/iwcap/src/iwcap.c">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/p … rc/iwcap.c</a></p><p>Basically you would filter away all non-data frames, also discard all frames not originating from the mac of your robot.<br />In the remaining frames you can derive the RSSI from the radiotap header.</p>									</div>

					<p>thank you jow,</p><p>You&#039;re right, I just check, and apparently the &quot;wl rssi...&quot; command works with the LinkSys WRT54GL insted of the 1043ND.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure to understand the interest of the radiotap header : the RSSI witch is in the header will be the signal strengh at the moment of the emission. Am I wrong? because what I need is the signal strengh at the reception on the router.</p><p>Anyway, I still will have to put a routine listening on a specific port, and sending new messages to the computer.</p><p>by the way, thank you for your iwcap.c code, I will definitely use it to write the listening routine.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know its an old topic but I have a similar doubt so I would like to reuse this thread.</p><p>So, I need to make a kind of Wi fi Positioning System but unlike the scenario proposed by the owner thread, in my case, the devices tracked will not be connected to my network.</p><p>My question is whether using a command like &quot;tcpdump-ne-y ieee802_11_radio-s 256-i wi0&quot; or even &quot;iwcap.c&quot; over an Atheros router I will be able to track MAC addresses and Signal Strength of these devices through the packets sent even outside network.</p><p>I thought its possible to do this when the phones periodically scan<br />the Wi-Fi band for access points, which typically involves probe message transmissions.</p><p>Thank.</p>									</div>
