					<p>Running kamikaze build 6317.</p><p>I am using an ext3 filesystem on a USB flash drive, which I desire to mount up at boot-time.</p><p>For reasons that have me at the edge of my sanity, the only way I can get it to work is to mount the full scsi path (e.g. /dev/scsi/host0/bus0. . etc) in my &quot;done&quot; startup file.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t put that in there, and the drive is in the USB slot at boot-up, it never mounts it.</p><p>But, at virtually any time after boot, I pull the drive and then re-insert it, I find it automagically mounted as /dev/sda1 on /tmp/sda1.</p><p>Does anyone know how that might be accomplished at boot-time, instead of having to sit and insert the drive later?</p><p>Thx.</p>									</div>
