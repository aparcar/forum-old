					<p>Hi!</p><p>I configured 2 routers with OpenWRT enabled 802.11s mesh network.</p><br /><p>First, I created in router 1 a wireless mesh network. After that, I joined the router 2 to the mesh. This works fine. the problem is: I can&#039;t ssh/ping the router 2 anymore. Because while it is on the mesh, it&#039;s like his IP doesn&#039;t exist anymore.<br />I need a way to access the router 2 without disable the mesh connection to router 1.</p><p>How they are configured?<br />well, lan interface (type bridge) has two wifi-ifaces associated, ap and mesh mode.<br />so I can access the mesh network by wifi and cable ethernet.</p><p>I tryed an other configuration, <br />the router 2 has two interfaces, lan (as usual) and an other called &#039;wifi&#039;, just the second one has the wifi-ifaces with mesh associated. <br />This configuration is near to this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedap</a><br />What is the result?<br />I can ssh the router 2 by ethernet. But I can&#039;t connect to the mesh, just by wifi.<br />As I told before, I need both of them connected to mesh and enable for configuration access (ssh).</p><br /><p>data:<br />routers: <br />TP-Link WR841ND and WA 701ND. Doesn&#039;t matter what&#039;s the router 1 or 2,&nbsp; they works same way.</p>									</div>
