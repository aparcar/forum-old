					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve just bought a Linksys WRT54GX-v2 router, and it&#039;s working quite nicely (I am impressed by the way it managed to actually boost my old 802.11b network, and I can&#039;t wait to get some new 802.11g cards). Anyway, it is very frustrating to know it runs linux and to be unable to play around with it (not to mention the lack of features of the default firmware)... that&#039;s why I think OpenWRT would be a nice addition to it, I really love what you&#039;ve done with this firmware!</p><p>I have extensive experience with Linux, however I&#039;ve never worked with an embedded version, so this is all new to me. But I&#039;d like to help make OpenWRT work on this router (from what I gather, it does work but the wireless drivers are not functional). Where do I start? Is is ok to install the latest release (whiterussian rc2?) and start from there? And what are the problems with the drivers that need to be sorted out? Any other way I can help?</p><p>Thanks and keep up the good work,<br />Mihnea</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRT54GX v2 is based on Realtek&#039;s 8186 cpu. First we need to get our hands on one to check, how the bootloader works.. After that, we need to migrate it from uClinux to normal one. As In the v1 case, I don&#039;t have any pre-N gear, if someone donates one, I would be happy to get it to work. If it&#039;s a v1, I&#039;m happy to get the wireless on the go, if it&#039;s a v2, then we can add support for the RTL8186 stuff, too (btw, more and more stuff seems to use that platform, like D-Link&#039;s MIMO router and the WAP54GX).</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I guess this is what I get for buying cutting-edge stuff (actually, when I made the order the only available version was the v1... they got me the v2 as some kind of &quot;bonus&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )... Now, from what I understand the RTL8186 SoC is pretty new, and just starting to make it&#039;s way onto devices (I couldn&#039;t find anything interesting on the realtek web page, except a notice in a press release). There has been a predecessor though, the RTL8181, for which people have started developing an open-source platform -- <a href="http://rtl8181.sf.net">http://rtl8181.sf.net</a>. It may take a while for the 8186 to be supported too, but it looks promising.</p><p>You can check their forums out, there is some info there, including a link to the RTL8186 data sheet (which is pretty complete, and labeled &quot;confidential&quot; :-P ):</p><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1225263&amp;forum_id=338328">http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php? … _id=338328</a></p><p>This may also be of interest:<br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1323336&amp;forum_id=350305">http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php? … _id=350305</a></p><p>All-in-all, looks like there may be a chance to get this supported. Unfortunately, I am in no position to donate a router at the moment, but I can test and report on any advances.</p><p>On a sidenote, how did you find out that it was a RTL8186 (apart from opening one up)? -- I couldn&#039;t find any info regarding this on the FCC site (it actually has the same FCC ID as the WRT54GXv1, ant that one is based on the Airgo chipset). Any other places with information?</p><p>Thanks and best regards,<br />Mihnea</p>									</div>

					<p>Duh! I had only browsed very summarily over the tarball, and seeing the Askey/Airgo directory made me believe it was the same as the v1...<br />Now I&#039;m playing a little more with it... I found a lot of refferences (the /vendors directory, and various configuration options in the linux/.config files) to the RTL865X platform, reviewed <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/motherboard/20050207/market_survey-10.html">here</a> and with some info on the <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/products1-2.aspx?modelid=2003102">Realtek web site</a>.<br />From what you say, it probably means that Realtek didn&#039;t bother to change the name of the files in their linux code offered to OEM&#039;s and that the chip is actually a RTL8186? Or am I looking in the wrong places?<br />For what it&#039;s worth, checking the .config file reveals the support for 8MB Flash and 32Mb SDRAM, but those are only configuration options... dunno if they represent actual hardware used on the device.</p><p>Also, could you tell me if it would be possible to modify some stuff in this tarball and then assemble it into a working firmware using the linksys toolchain? Because if that were the case, I could start hacking around with this and see were that takes me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mgc8</strong> on 4 Aug 2005, 15:58)</p>

					<p>I managed to get a hold of the kernel messages, by looking at the syslog right after reboot... As far as I can see, linux identifies it as a &quot;Realtek RTL8651B SoC, rev 1&quot; and it is confirmed that it has 32MB of SDRAM, a (probably) 200Mhz processor (from the bogomips), and some flash memory (any idea how we can identify for sure the size?).

					<p>Hello again!</p><p>Any news on this battlefront? I&#039;d really like to see OpenWRT on the GXv2, I&#039;ve just got it to work on an Asus wl500gx and now it&#039;s bugging me that the Linksys is still using an inferior firmware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I tried sending some inquiries toward Linksys, but as soon as I started to ask hardware-related questions (the support-droid was only able to tell me &quot;airgo chipset, mimo technology&quot;... bleah) the replies -- otherwise extremely timely and courteous -- suddenly stopped. Hmmm... where to turn to now? Realtek? I am still wondering about the relationship between this chipset (RTL8651) and the RTL8181/8186. Are they similar enough so that the code from rtl8181.sf.net would work? I&#039;ll go ask around there, too.</p><p>In the meantime, I&#039;ve played around with the official firmware (WRT54GX-v2-2.00.08.tgz), but I don&#039;t know whethere it would be possible to compile a working &quot;custom&quot; version from that one? Would I be able to add, say, telnet support, compile, flash and expect it to work alright? I wasn&#039;t able to find the init scripts and such... probably the result of too little sleep :-/</p><p>So... any pointers as to how I could start hacking this router? I&#039;m downloading the openwrt build tools as I write this, I&#039;ll go have a look to see what needs to be changed in order for it to work on the RTL8651. Of course, your assistance would be priceless <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>From the system log, it seems WRT54GX v2 is for sure based on 8651B. And it seems both 8186 and 8651B are Realtek&#039;s new product. I can&#039;t even find any product webpages at Realtek&#039;s website!!?? After some Google research, my conclusion is 8651B and 8186 are two different SoC although they are both based on LX5280 CPU. 8186 is a LX5280 CPU + WLAN SoC while 8651B is a LX5280 CPU + 5 port fast ethernet L4 switch (seems there are a lot of fancy features in it) SoC. </p><p>Since the CPU is the same, I think we can try to use the 8186 toolchain on 8651.</p>									</div>

And how can we test this? Maybe someone figures out some kind of exploit like the &quot;ping exploit&quot; from the older firmwares, that would make it alot easier...

					<p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> No good news, eh? I&#039;ve been busy playing around with OpenWRT on my Asus wl500gx, but the Linksys beastie waits for a proper firmware instead of the lame default one... I&#039;m eager to help in any way with testing and whatnot (as long as it doesn&#039;t involve opening things up and soldering -- I do that plenty with my other devices, but this one is a little too new and expensive <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p><p>Unfortunately, the guys over at rtl8181.sf.net seem missing in action, since there was no reply on those forums for some months now. Linksys support is also extremely polite and yet provides no help in this regard. Any other directions to dig into?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Mihnea</p>									</div>

					<p>I my self just got a WRT54GX2 and want very badly to be running OpenWRT, my 3 year old linksys finnaly went and now that OpenWRT May be a option i am very excited to put it into good use when support becomes avaible. The lack of features in this model is sad my older router had more at least twice as much room for portfowarding then this one does now alone. </p><p>Hope you guys hvae made some progress.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve also experienced various problems with this router, especially from the wireless side (and this is even more unfortunate, considering it&#039;s main selling point was the wireless). I am not sure however whether these issues stem from a buggy firmware or from the drivers or hardware itself -- in which case it would be much more difficult to get it working.</p><p>As a sidenote, Airgo are really unfriendly to the Linux/OSS comunity, their windows drivers for the PCMCIA cards are a P.O.S., buggy even, they can&#039;t work even with NDIS-wrappers. They have been contacted but so far to no avail... Seems like we&#039;ll have to reverse-engineer every bit of this router due to their and linksys&#039;s business practices :-/</p><p>Anyway, if someone manages to get this thing to work with OpenWRT, a lot of people will be more than happy, myself included -- it may at least approach the level of usefullness promised on the package.</p><p>Best wishes,<br />Mihnea</p>									</div>
