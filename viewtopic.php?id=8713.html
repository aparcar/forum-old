					<p>Hello Everyone!</p><br /><p>I have a Linksys WRT54GL router. I tried installing 2.6 version kernel that comes with Kamikaze; make menuconfig showed that &quot;atheros wifi&quot; is the only option available; </p><p>After flashing the firmware, the wireless seems to work (as I am able to telnet/ssh to it through the wireless interface), but I on doing an &quot;iwconfig&quot;, i get &quot;no wireless extensions&quot; for all the interfaces ... why is this the case?</p><p>Here is what I would like to do, but I am stuck right now ::</p><p>1. I want to be able to put the interface into monitor mode etc, but &quot;iwconfig&quot; does not work. Are there any alternatives to do this?</p><p>2. Is it better to install 2.4 kernel instead ?</p><p>3. What is the wireless driver that is being used? Is it an open source driver? (It might be easier for me to make some changes I want if the driver is open source)</p><p>4. Do you suggest switching to a different router? What is the router that is best supported by OpenWRT? Madwifi is open source, so having madwifi on a router would be useful to me -- what is the best router for having the combination of openWRT and madwifi ?</p><br /><p>Any suggestions/comments would be of great help to me. Thanks a lot for the same!</p><p>Best,<br />-SK</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t understand how you connected via the wireless interface - you need Broadcom wifi for the Linksys. The Broadcom driver is a binary-only object (not open source) which only runs under a 2.4 kernel. There&#039;s an attempt at writing a 2.6 open source driver, but it&#039;s very experimental, mainly because Broadcom don&#039;t release the programming specs for their hardware.</p><p>So for your existing hardware you need to rebuild with a 2.4 kernel, which will offer you Broadcom wifi as an option. Or just use White Russian RC6 if you want something which just works out-of-the-box.</p><p>I don&#039;t know what hardware currently works with madwifi - probably something with an Atheros mini-PCI card. The Atheros system-on-chip devices (including Fonera, Meraki Mini and Compex WP54WRT) are not currently supported by OpenWrt, although I have heard rumours this will happen Real Soon Now.</p>									</div>
