					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m getting problems logging onto xbox live through my WRT54GL with kamikaze. I&#039;m on sky broadband in the UK, so have to use their equipment, which is a sagem 2504 with locked down firmware, so I&#039;ve been forced to put the wrt54gl on the dmz rather than bridged. </p><p>Xbox live will log in fine through the sagem, and plays fine for hours on end, but through the openwrt it won&#039;t. All MTU&#039;s were set to 1500, and I&#039;ve since tested them all at 1365, and restarted, but still nothing. </p><p>I&#039;ve got the iptables rules setup for the port forwarding fine as far as I can tell, but the Xbox live check on the xbox isn&#039;t even getting that far. </p><p>Is there anything else I need to do to get this working?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
