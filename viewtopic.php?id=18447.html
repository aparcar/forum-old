					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am after a router to be used with a webcam to turn it into a wireless ip camera. I have managed to put together all sorts of bits, but not all of them in one package. I use NSLU2 and love it. I know I can connect a usb wireless adapter and a webcam to it. But I would actually like to find something that has all of the below:</p><p>1. USB 2.0 port (or ports).<br />2. Wireless integrated.<br />3. 8MB of Flash if possible to accommodate OpenVPN, dynamic DNS client, mjpeg_streamer, motion, nfs client and any kernel modules necessary (maybe I could get away with 4MB?).<br />4. Still available to buy (in UK if possible). WL-500gp version1 seems ideal - but can&#039;t be bought anymore.<br />5. Fairly well supported in openwrt (or other firmware that offer support for all above features). I don&#039;t mind some troubleshooting, but I can&#039;t claim I am skilled to the point of attaching JTAG&#039;s or hacking away at the code. I have managed to install and configure several NSLU2&#039;s and loved it - but I would say that their support in OpenWRT is quite stable by now. Actually, something like the NSLU2 - but with wireless integrated and still available to buy would be absolutely ideal.</p><p>I have searched the entire hardware database - and there are some devices which offer some of the above - but none seem to offer all of them. I can purchase WL-500gp version 2 - but there doesn&#039;t seem to be an OpenWRT image for it which can be used to install everything else on (openvpn, nfs client, camera modules etc) - and the wireless support without changing the card in 2.6 seems non-existent or unusable.</p><p>One more point for anybody out-there: I have wondered lately where is the whole NSLU2 / WRT54G going? In the sense that these devices are almost discontinued now - does anybody see any replacements with as wide support coming along? Is Linksys (or anybody else) releasing a replacement for NSLU2 which will be just as usable/hackable? What are your opinions?</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions</p><p>EDIT: The Netgear WGT634U again seems to fulfill all my requirements - except that it has been discontinued already and is unavailable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xj25vm</strong> on 15 Jan 2009, 18:56)</p>

I picked up two for $45.00 recently. However, you would need to understand serial connections to get OpenWRT loaded up. The other catch is finding a router that has full 5V usb powered ports. The WGT634U may provide enough power for your camera though...</p>									</div>
