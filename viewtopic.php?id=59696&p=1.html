					<p>Very clean. Like the menu bar on the left side of the screen (reminds me of Tomato <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. Would love to see one more thing implemented from Tomato - less wasted space around the text. Tomato was very efficient with screen real estate, giving you a lot of information without scrolling. Glad it has been committed to trunk.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here is one thing that bothers me with this theme. If I enable to install luci-mod-failsafe package, all the buttons that parallel with the Fail Safe / Administration entry (located at the bottom right corner) will get interfered and/or blocked and become unresponsive to mouse clicks. My suggestion is to put this Fail Safe / Administration entry on the top right-hand corner as the Luci theme OpenWRT. Otherwise, create a bottom panel for the <em>Powered by LuCI Master (git-15.261.46806-1209ab6) / OpenWrt Designated Driver r47008</em> and Fail Safe / Administration entry. This way, it will not interfere with any button</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you!</p><p>I have just installed the Material Theme from git, but learned after that it is now available in the software updates from Luci.&nbsp; Versions appear the same.</p><p>I like the new look a lot, but find the performance on my HooToo TM02 to be sluggish, though quite usable.&nbsp; </p><p>This is a <strong>BIG</strong> improvement for mobile devices, however my iPhone 4 with IOS 7 is having problems running the pages. Once displayed they appear to fit nicely.&nbsp; The slide menu address navigation well with the large fonts on the small screen.&nbsp; The Login page is having a problem with submit, and then takes a long time&nbsp; The side menu and pages will not flick and I need to scroll the surface with my finger on the screen to move them.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to open the network tab at the bottom with out selecting something by accident.&nbsp; Some pages do not completely load.&nbsp; I was on the status page and have nothing below Network IPv6 WAN and it is stuck at collecting data.&nbsp; While the side menu comes out in a few seconds, I get hung trying to load the wifi tab.&nbsp; Once it loads, I am again unable to see the full page.&nbsp; Pages seem to adjust fine when rotated.&nbsp; Pages appear to run fine under bootstrap.</p><p>The routers memory 15/10/5.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I have USB and OpenVPN luci packages installed, and saw no noticeable issues with content presentation for these or other menus on the PC.</p><p>Thanks again for your effort!</p>									</div>
