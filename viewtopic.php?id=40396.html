					<p>I have two Linksys WRT54GL routers running my home network. Still great little gadgets <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> One of them is running the bcrm2.4 release of Backfire 10.03.1, and is my primary gateway to the internet for my home network. However, due to lack of good IPv6 firewall support, this router purely handles IPv4, not IPv6. We&#039;ll call this router 1.</p><p>My second router sits behind the first one and extends wireless range of the network (same SSID, different channel), as well as allows a couple of wired gadgets to connect to the net. This router is running the bcrm47xx release of Backfire 10.03.1. It also is my IPv6 gateway (currently utilising AICCU and a tunnel from SixXS). We&#039;ll call this router 2.</p><p>For any device on the network capable of using IPv6, the setup is currently working perfectly. They get their IPv4 address from router 1 via DHCP, and their IPv6 address from router 2 using RADVD.</p><p>However, router 1 doesn&#039;t have any IPv6 connectivity. Is there a way to have router 1 get an IPv6 address from router 2? I realise this will create a loop of sorts (traffic would go from router 1 to router 2 and back to router 1 again to actually go out onto the internet), but I don&#039;t plan for router 1 to be doing anything strenuous via IPv6, I just want it to have the connectivity.</p><p>Setting up another tunnel isn&#039;t an option (the aforementioned firewall issues being 1 problem, the lack of space being another, router 1 also acts as a free hotspot for people near the house using Chilli, so there&#039;s already a bit of space used up), and when I already have a perfectly good gateway on router 2, it seems silly to duplicate it anyway.</p><p>Has anyone tried this, or know if it&#039;s possible? I&#039;ve tried the net.ipv6.conf.br-lan.accept_ra=2 trick using sysctl already, didn&#039;t seem to work, but I didn&#039;t reboot afterwards (I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary anyway, however I&#039;m at work and don&#039;t want to risk knocking my connection to home offline).</p><p>Thanks for any help anyone can offer <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You need one /64 prefix for each IPv6 network or peer-to-peer link you are setting up. One /48 or /56 prefix would be preferably, from which you creates two or more /64. I don&#039;t know about sixxs but with Hurricane Electric you can get one /48 per tunnel. For routers I try to avoid using RA to set addresses, and use static config.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve done that part already. I have a /48 subnet of which I&#039;m using a single /64 piece of it, and router 2 is serving that subnet using RADVD. Other devices on the network are successfully able to get the prefix and create a full IPv6 address, and connect to IPv6 addresses.</p><p>The only gap with this setup is router 1 has no IPv6 connectivity. I don&#039;t need another tunnel, I just want router 1 to act as an IPv6 client to router 2 (which itself is a client to router 1 for IPv4 connectivity).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have been running IPV6 at home for more than a year with various isp configs. The router I use is a dlink DIR-825 that finally is behaving as it should. Meanwhile, the ISP (Telia) has gone from 6to4 to 6rd. So, my router gets its address based on its IP4 d:o, and now publishes a /64 prefix.</p><p>Hosts autoconfig and all is fine. I have tried to add two TL-WR841ND&#039;s mainly to use as wireless extenders (a bridge) to the adjacent building. No cigar, and it indicates the IPV6 / bridging / network code in Openwrt is not due for prime time. </p><p>However, beeing interested in the IPV6 migration, I am asking you to post what *is* and what *is not* working v.r. Openwrt. </p><p>I&#039;ll start: LAN A w ipv6 -- WR841 -- WDS link -- WR841 -- LAN B. Both routers with AA 12.09 beta 2 + kmod-ipv6 . Both routers eventually (will measure time) autoconfigure with the advertised prefix, so RADVD announcements get through, but I have traces where announcements have been corrupted by openwrt. It might happen &quot;at random&quot;. However, it is NOT possible to communicate using IPV6, I have not determined yet exactly WHAT happens to the packets, (need to setup trace on wireless to capture WDS). Routing tables on two linux systems (on A and B) look the same.</p>									</div>

Moreover, these are sent as different multicasts 33:33:xx:xx:xx:xx, . There are interface parameters mc_forwarding but someone has gone to lengths to define these as readonly in the /proc filesystem. It is interesting to see that most OTHER params can be switched on/off, but not these. There must be some logic here, and I guess these are set up somehow during init, (not precompiled??) so now the question is WHERE to turn these on.

And the way it works is wrong, at least with my config. However, it would be nice if the only components required for a working router were the base system + kmod-ipv6. I read the &quot;fine print&quot; and installed kmod-ip6tables and ip6tables with the assumption that would change the mc_forwarding default. No, that did NOT change anything. Anyway, it is not consistant, and since when bridged wifi and switch0 are the same &quot;lan&quot;, it should be transparent by default, after all ports in the switch are. The problem is I do not know what the openwrt designers had in mind: IS there some important aspect that has warranted disabling L2 connectivity, and why did someone go to the extent of making that system parameter READONLY, or is this just a bug? 13 years ago, working at D I G I T A L , we had this running smoothly, and yes, you dont need a router, and multiple routers on a LAN should also autoconfigure by overlap / merge. So finally we could get rid of SOME of the manual IP config work. </p><p>But, if it was hard to write, it should be hard to read :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gulweb</strong> on 18 Nov 2012, 04:08)</p>

					<p>I have not been able to find any writeup about how this is ACTUALLY supposed to work. My ramblings up til now seems very wrong anyhow.</p><p>Clearly mc_forwarding is NOT supposed to be a significant knob with regards to this. My testing has proceeded, and I can see the default router<br />messages: There is a &quot;current multicast table&quot; ( I think) at /proc/net/dev_mcast. In this table there are entries that correspond to allnodes multicast, which explains why the router multicast gets through. It is possible to ping6 all local addresses (fe80::......) but then the MAC addresses can be derived from these IPV6 addresses.&nbsp; My TL-WR841s are now running AA 12.09 beta2 + kmod-ipv6 + radvd. Radvd is started, but does NOT cause the 841s to transmit anything, even though they have heard the lan IPV6 router announcement , and configured&nbsp; a &quot;live&quot; IPV6 prefix.</p><p>In the web interface, there is an option to 1) listen to IPV6 announcement or 2) send announcement. However, these are mutually exclusive.</p><p>A peculiar thing is that the MAC mc-address corresponding to the router ITSELF is added to the table, however, I do not understand why the router would want to listen to ITSELF, these filters are input only are they not? A case of loop detection??</p><p>Right now I believe there is something that needs to be turned on, i.e. the ipv6 router proper for the blocked mcasts to be enabled.</p>									</div>

					<p>The ndp problem is still there, but right now I have three routers on the LAN, one that is the &quot;real&quot; one, that propagates a 6rd address out on the LAN<br />and two that just have the kmod-ipv6 and radvd installed, now all routers agree on the prefix and topology. However, hosts cannot talk across the WDS bridge. Within the routers everything can be reached, and because of the neighbor cache, if I first ping a host FROM openwrt, then that host can also ping6 that router. Leaving the net idle, it is not possible to initiate anything from a host, and tcpdumping shows no router responses to neighbor solicitations. </p><p>So, now the question is: what optional component / package is required to turn on ndp forwarding in the openwrt ipv6 stack?</p>									</div>

I cannot imagine this is entirely broken, (which I suspected b4 trying to understand the details) but I now suspect there is some component missing that has been architected by someone, problem is we do not know what, who and when. I tried to understand what the proxy was supposed for, and probably not for solving this problem.</p><p>The *correct* (??) way to solve this is of course to make sure a bridge should look the same whether it is IPV4 ( same subnet) IPV6 (same subnet) or other protocols that might be used on a LAN. Right now I believe just disabling multicast filtering could be done with only &quot;one knob&quot;, some more elaborate solution (for ipv6)&nbsp; would be to allow ALL 33:33:xx.xx.xx.xx multicasts &quot;allow_ip6_multicasts&quot;. I will surely pursue something like this, since I want my clients to be treated equal, whether IP4 / IP6 or mixed stack. I have no problem with this NOT beeing default behaviour, it it is easy to reconfigure. I have used the Linux bridge in the past, clearly many things have changed since then, and most of this is lack of understanding on my behalf&quot;<br />Regards,</p><p>Gulweb</p>									</div>
