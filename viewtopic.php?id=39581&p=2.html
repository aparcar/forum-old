					<p>This firmware isn&#039;t what bricked my router, the problem I had was the exact same problem the patch earlier in this thread is supposed to fix. Every time I&#039;d configure wifi and turn it on, I&#039;d lose the wired switch and had to boot into failsafe mode. The bricking actually happened while trying to revert to DD-WRT or stock Linksys firmware so I could get online while I recompiled. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p><p>Looking at the patch (and knowing that it was correctly applied and didn&#039;t work for me) I wonder if the chip_id is different. The patch is looking for chip_id 47612 and I have no idea how to find the chip_id for my router, didn&#039;t see it in dmesg or /proc/cpuinfo but /proc/cpuinfo does say &quot;Broadcom BCM4716 chip rev 1&quot; so I&#039;m wondering if I should be looking for chip_id 47611 instead (maybe the E1000 and later 160Nv3 models use a rev 2 CPU?). I really doubt the GPIO is different since it worked for harmon58 but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to find out my router has an older revision of the CPU than the E1000 does.</p><p>Edit: I think I may have found my problem. The patch hhm1 posted earlier in this thread is applied to my buildroot and the file package/mac80211/patches/916-b43-gpio_init-maskset.patch is there (and correct), but somehow this patch was never applied to the kernel source. I applied the patch manually and I&#039;m recompiling now, so we&#039;ll see soon enough.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stevenh512</strong> on 3 Feb 2013, 13:14)</p>
