					<p>I think it&#039;s long since I&#039;m having this issue, maybe back from kamikaze days.<br />My wl500gp is based on r31151 brcm47xx and is only able to reach a mere ~10Mbits on LAN ports.</p><p>Here are my tests:</p><p>~31MiB tgz from router to pc directly connected to eth0.0 @100Mbps:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@router:/mnt/sdb1# cat extroot-image.tgz | pv -a | nc 192.168.9.1 10000
[1.41MB/s]</code></pre></div><p>same file sent to /dev/null, just to show SD&#039;s reading speed:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@router:/mnt/sdb1# cat extroot-image.tgz | pv -a &gt; /dev/null 
[6.35MB/s]</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;d have expected 1.41MB/s if it only was a 10Mbits ethernet connection.<br />So I really don&#039;t know where the problem stems, considering that qos, wifi, wan, syn protection are off.</p><br /><p>Some interesting bits, although it seems to me to be no problems at all:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@router:/mnt/sdb1# dmesg|grep b44
