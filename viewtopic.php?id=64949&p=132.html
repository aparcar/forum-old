I&#039;ll give SQM QoS. another try using eth1 rather then eth1.2 and see if that makes a difference in using 0 for download. Who knows might make a difference. My Comcast I am paying for 75mbps and seems to be provisioned for 90 which is about what I expected. Get close to 89 day and night so they must have things built out pretty good around here unlike some places.</p></blockquote></div><p>I highly doubt you&#039;ll notice any difference in real-world performance, and if 0 for downstream resulted in buffer-bloat before for you, I&#039;m sure it still will.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that eth1 is the better choice because it covers 100% of WAN traffic instead of 98 or 99% like eth1.2 does.&nbsp; Plus it works directly on the hardware, instead of a virtual switch, so it may relieve some load off the router&#039;s SoC/CPU and RAM as well <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>What was surprising to me was how SQM can&#039;t handle downstream speeds of 300mbps (as mentioned before, it seemed to max out around 150mbps down).&nbsp; As I said before, I don&#039;t know if its a router CPU/SoC speed limitation or a SQM or possible cake limitation.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try it again one day and see what my CPU load is on the router while running a speed test to find out.&nbsp; Honestly, I think it&#039;s a SQM or possible cake limitation.</p><p>Off topic: I get the full 300/30mbps on my plan on Cox as well, even though they say my modem (Surfboard SB6141 with 8 bonded channels down/4 up) is only good enough for their 150mbps plan.&nbsp; They claim you need 16 bonded channels down for their &quot;Ultimate&quot; 300/30 plan.&nbsp; I honestly didn&#039;t care if I got the full 300 down, since I&#039;m saving $5/month for 12 months compared to the 50/5 plan I was on, but it does pull the full 300mbps.&nbsp; I bet they just want people on the 300/30 plan to have 16 bonded channels for load distribution and to rent/buy a new overpriced modem from them.&nbsp; 8 bonded channel modems theoretical max is 343mbps down, so I was honestly surprised I got the full 300mbps.</p><p>I&#039;m not buying a new modem until I find out if they will be rolling out either DOCSIS 3.1 or &quot;Gigablast&quot; which is FTTH (fiber to the home, which doesn&#039;t even require a modem of any kind) in my neighborhood.&nbsp; Both will provide 1gbps down.</p></blockquote></div><p>@starcms<br />As you guessed changing to eth1 did not make any difference in SQM QoS. Still need to define download and upload both. Thought if I played some with leaving the download at 0 and playing with the upload I could get things to a happy place. Not true. I don&#039;t play games so some buffer bloat is not a big thing to me. It is more of just playing to see what I can do with the router and features. </p><p>Latest of David&#039;s builds has turned my wrt3200 into to the&nbsp; router I thought it should be. Fast and reliable. Runs well with Brainslayer&#039;s latest DD-WRT builds as well, but for some reason 5GHz wireless on his builds is slower then David&#039;s and latest Linksys OEM on my simple iperf test. He is using the latest drivers and 4.9 kernel.</p>									</div>
