					<p>For those who find these things interesting...</p><p>The firmware looks like it&#039;s compressed. Using some other details I found on the web, I uncompressed part of the bin using instructions from <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Linksys-Blue-Box-Router-HOWTO.html">http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Li … HOWTO.html</a>. (see step 6)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=firmware.bin bs=60 skip=1 | zcat &gt; comp.img</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, I hit a wall from there.. The kernel on my debian box doesn&#039;t have cramfs installed. Using strings, however, I saw many references to squashfs - perhaps Linksys has switched?</p><p>If anyone makes further progress mounting this, please let me know. I&#039;m interested to see what&#039;s hidden that wasn&#039;t included in the source.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I extracted the firmware using those commands.&nbsp; Now tell me, how the heck did you find the beginning marker for the squashfs partition?&nbsp; Please, tell me everything, because I can only assume you&#039;re looking for a particular hex string.&nbsp; Using hexdump is no good, because it wraps the lines and you can never guarantee you&#039;ll get the string of hex characters you&#039;re looking for in one chunk.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Kaldek</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah right.&nbsp; So if I had half a brain and realised that these markers are referred to as &quot;magic&quot; markers I would have gone to google and found it hours ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sheesh, 11 years in the biz (not development) and entire areas of fact slip you by...</p><p>Anyway, does anyoneknow of a hex searching tool like hexdump, that can search an entire file for a particular series of characters, and *then* format the output (as opposed to dumping the file, formatting it, then using grep to find te magic marker - which causes the problem I mentioned in my previous post).&nbsp; I actually managed to find &quot;hsqs&quot; in this particular firmware image using hexdump, because it was thankfully in the middle of a line when dumped to ascii format.</p><p>Kaldek</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaldek</strong> on 5 Jul 2005, 07:02)</p>

					<p>I usually just use hexedit which is included in most distributions I think (<a href="http://merd.sourceforge.net/pixel/hexedit.html">http://merd.sourceforge.net/pixel/hexedit.html</a>)</p><p>With that editor you can quickly search for ascii strings or hex strings</p>									</div>
