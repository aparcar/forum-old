					<p>Hi,</p><p>This is my first post here so ..&nbsp; few words about me. Linux passionate who started years ago on old good slackware. Profesionally involved in Linux based solutions and wireless networks (not necessarily connected). Enough <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>So... I&#039;ve bough a HG659 with my broadband from Vodafone NZ just because the deal was good and hadn&#039;t yet my WR1043ND delivered from other location. But now it lays on the shelf and catches dust, and what a pity as this HW looks to be really worth a job.<br />It comes with VDSL and VoIP support (I know, I know...) but also with 2 USBs and usual 4+1 ethernet so I believe would be a nice toy if put OpenWRT there.<br />I took out the case and made some pics. Please check it out on:&nbsp; <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1vzED#2">https://imgur.com/a/1vzED#2</a><br />Found some fw from Spark Telecom site (as couldn&#039;t find it neither on VF and Huawei sites) and play on it a little.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    0 drwxr-xr-x  2 px2 px2        0 Dec 30 15:51 .

Nothing exciting for me as probably I don&#039;t know what to look for. Additional thing is that I found fstab entry which tells there should be other jffs which I couldn&#039;t find - I&#039;m really bad in that things... so far I hope <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />)<br />Filelist of that <a href="http://pastebin.com/0Wd0Y6Mq">here</a></p><p>I&#039;m happy to help somehow in making it working under openwrt or providing any (reachable) data about it.<br />Unfortunately I haven&#039;t got any JTAG programmer and never used any (but can&#039;t it be so hard, right?) so I didn&#039;t try to put anything on it yet as I don&#039;t want just brick it. But... happy to experiment with someone experienced and under guidance.<br />Anyone would like to help? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, you should post or try to identify the main chip the router is using.<br />I tried looking at the photo but I can&#039;t make out what chip the router is using.</p><p>I can only see Broadcom BCM53124 which is chip for the ethernet switch, i.e. same switch as <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tp-link_td-w8970_v3.0">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tp- … w8970_v3.0</a></p><p>After you have identified the chip, then you can check if Openwrt supports that particular chip.<br />If Openwrt supports that chip, then it will be a matter of creating the configuration file for the router to build for that router.</p><p>I don&#039;t know how to create the file but Openwrt have guides on that.</p><p>Note: I have a spare HG659 here and was trying to see if there is a change to run Openwrt on it. Its 802.11ac WiFi would make this router useful/valuable.</p><p>Cheers<br />Eric</p>									</div>

					<p>WOW! Almost year but finally someone found this post interesting <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Thanks eric... I made one more picture of it: <a href="https://imgur.com/vOvyu40">https://imgur.com/vOvyu40</a> and that&#039;s BCM63168 . Did check is it supported yet. Will try later or maybe you already know that.<br />BTW. router still is on the shelf dismantled and with soldered uart... ready to break it.</p>									</div>

					<p>BCM63168 can be supported by OpenWrt. The SoC is supported, but there are some problems to support the NAND flash chip. </p><p>Others routers with the same chip<br /><a href="http://www.tisdb.org/tag/bcm63168?do=showtag&amp;tag=bcm63168">http://www.tisdb.org/tag/bcm63168?do=sh … g=bcm63168</a></p><p>The main problem for making a firmware probably is the bootloader. For some reason the bootloader is in the same partition as rootfs, this can cause potential bricks. </p><p>Either I don&#039;t know if the driver for the NAND flash for bcm63xx is fully working.</p>									</div>

					<p>Around the bottom of this page, there are existing routers using BCM63168 already supported by Openwrt.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.broadcom.bcm63xx">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/s … om.bcm63xx</a></p><p>If you follow the router configuration files from those routers and modify it to suit HG659, you maybe able to make it work.</p><p>I have played with Broadcom chip based routers before and they tend to use CFE bootloader but I am unable to figure out how to enter HG659&#039;s CFE bootloader. Maybe it does not use CFE?</p><p>I am kinda disappointed to know this router only have a 400Mhz cpu, even though it is dual core but Openwrt can only uses one. I was hoping the cpu will be a lot faster than that.</p><p>The spark web site is saying the newer model HG659b has 128MB ram and 128MB flash memory. That is a lot for routers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I assume the HG659 may have similar amount of ram and flash which is a good thing to use with Openwrt.<br /><a href="http://www.spark.co.nz/shop/internet/modems/spark-hg659b/">http://www.spark.co.nz/shop/internet/mo … rk-hg659b/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ericwongcm</strong> on 1 Dec 2015, 07:41)</p>

					<p>Eric, <br />Now I&#039;ve got two of them... and totally no chance to find a minute to work on it. If you would like to have a try I&#039;m more than happy to give you one if you are keen to port Openwrt and make it running. I believe you would be much better in this than me.<br />I&#039;m NZ based so postage shouldn&#039;t be much, let me know if this fits for you.<br />You will get another one to collection and I will get at least one running and the people... who cares about people... will get new router on supported HW list <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Cheers<br />Px2</p>									</div>

I have already sold the HG659 I was playing with before at a good price.<br />I actually can&#039;t code, so I can&#039;t port either. The best I can do was to build custom ROM with selected packages because that is what I learned from earlier Openwrt projects I worked on.</p><p>I recently purchased Tp-link Archer C7 AC1750 and it is already supported by Openwrt, so I will be playing/using that instead. Actually, I usually use Gargoyle router firmware rather than Openwrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
