					<p>I&#039;ve been to a number of public access points where any DNS request is forwarded to a disclaimer page.&nbsp; Some of them require you to sign up for a free account and sign in before use. </p><p>I don&#039;t really know what this kind of DNS routing is called or how to implement this type of interface but I was curious to know if a package is available for OpenWrt that fits the above criteria.</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp; If not OpenWrt then what should I look into next?</p><p>Thank you in advance for any suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Use a captive portal such as NoCatSplash or Chillispot, both are available for OpenWrt and quite easy to configure</p>									</div>
