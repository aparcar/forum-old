					<p>There&#039;s no daily builds anymore. I only make new builds when it makes sense, because stuff keeps breaking. Now for instance, minidlna decided to switch to autoconf so the package needs to be redone. I could switch to the release version but that isn&#039;t compatible with minissdpd. Also, there hasn&#039;t been any interesting changes in trunk there&#039;s no need to update just for a higher version number.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a very weird problem with the latest builds (r28247, r28376) my old r27088 works fine , the &quot;G network&quot; starts stop working after a few hours. It means If I connect to the G wifi, the connection is established successfully, however I cant obtain an IP address and setting a static one makes no difference. Strangely the N wifi network works just fine, I can connect and get an IP adress without problems. This behaviour shows up only after a few hours of runtime and I can fix it by restarting the wifi network with &quot;wifi&quot;, the logs show no strange behaviour:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Oct  8 12:09:45 hostapd: wlan0: STA 00:23:76:25:XX:XX IEEE 802.11: authenticated

					<p>Hi arokh!</p><p>So today I was trying to flash my WNDR3700 to your firmware but I did not succeed. I tried the latest Oct 7 build and the previous Sept 14 build. I was using the TFTP method for flashing.<br />At first the router flashes normally but in the middle of the process the power led turns to green and keeps flashing fast. Fester than when you are in TFTP recovery mode. I found out that this means Corrupted Firmware.<br />When it is flashing I cannot reach the router by any means not through web interface nor TFTP. </p><p>So I am asking do you have any ideas why does the flash fail on my machine? I was flashing the correct image not the v2 one. I double checked that, also I tried the flashing from 3 times, first via TFTP, second via the original firmware&#039;s web interface and last again via TFTP. None of them worked.</p><p>I am using the original firmware now.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>sorry to bug you but have been looking through this thread and elsewhere and can not find a solution.</p><p>I am running your 14.9 build, got it to work pretty much as I like, but I have this issue: can not change the 2.4 radio to channels 12-13, and power limited to 50mw. The 5Ghz instead is wide open, thanks to my change in regulatory.bin (as per the wiki), and I can set it to IT and get allowed values.<br />Since I live in Italy, I am supposed to be able to get 100mw and those channels.<br />I have tried with the new regulator.bin, even written my own. <br />The funny part is that the 5Ghz radio goes:</p><p>PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:12.0 (0000 -&gt; 0002)<br />ath: EEPROM regdomain: 0x0<br />ath: EEPROM indicates default country code should be used<br />ath: doing EEPROM country-&gt;regdmn map search<br />ath: country maps to regdmn code: 0x3a<br />ath: Country alpha2 being used: US<br />ath: Regpair used: 0x3a</p><p>the 2.4 one goes:</p><p>ath: eeprom contains invalid mac address: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff<br />ath: random mac address will be used: 9e:eb:65:e4:d3:05<br />ath: EEPROM regdomain: 0x60<br />ath: EEPROM indicates we should expect a direct regpair map<br />ath: Country alpha2 being used: 00<br />ath: Regpair used: 0x60</p><p>So different reg domain. No matter what country I set this to, I always have that limit.
