					<p>I&#039;ve recently migrated my 50 or so WRT54G routers from White Russian to Kamikaze.&nbsp; Under WR, I used robocfg to view physical port status of each of the 5 ethernet ports on the back of the router.&nbsp; Unfortunately, robocfg doesn&#039;t do that with Kami, and I desperately need the ability to tell what ports have a physical connection to them.<br />Is there a /dev/ file I can look in to get this information, or perhaps another package that tells me what is physically going on with my ethernet ports?</p><p>Thanks.<br />John</p>									</div>
