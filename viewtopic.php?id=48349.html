					<p>I administer a lot of access points remotely.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using OpenVPN and vtun. vtun is essentially dead, and OpenVPN will no longer install on the newest access points with 4MB of flash.</p><p>This leaves ssh tunneling.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit tricky to get it set up but it is certainly doable.</p><p>First off, we&#039;re trying to access an access point that&#039;s behind a NAT firewall, with possibly a dynamic IP, so there&#039;s no way to get hold of it directly.&nbsp; The access point has to reach out to us.</p><p>Terminology:&nbsp; </p><p>Remote access point - the access point located at a remote location that we want to administer.<br />Local host - the machine that we will be sitting at while administering the remote access point.</p><p>while you still have the access point in hand next to the local host, you need to set up passwordless ssh logins.</p><p>Log into the remote access point, and create the keys:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># mkdir ~/.ssh
# dropbearkey -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code></pre></div><p>Now convert the keys to the format used by ssh.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># dropbearkey -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Public key portion is:
ssh-rsa longstring of gibberish= root@RemoteAccessPoint
Fingerprint: md5 aa:.....:ff
#</code></pre></div><p>Copy everything from ssh-rsa to the end of the access point name.</p><p>Log out of the remote access point.</p><p>Now on the host machine, add that to the end&nbsp; of the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat - &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[paste the snippet you copied above]
^D (hold the control key down and hit &#039;D&#039;)
#</code></pre></div><p>Log into the Remote Access Point using ssh.</p><p>Create a script to make the connection:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># vi /usr/bin/ssh_tunnel
#!/bin/sh

sleep 3
. /lib/functions/network.sh; network_get_ipaddr ip lan
ssh -R 2201:$ip:22 username@hostname.com -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa -N -y -K 3 -I 600
:wq
# chmod +x /usr/bin/ssh_tunnel
#</code></pre></div><p>For username, use the user account with the authorized key on the host machine.&nbsp; For the hostname, use the internet name for the host machine.</p><p>Now edit /etc/inittab on the Remote Access Point and add the startup line.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># vi /etc/inittab
.....
::respawn::/usr/bin/ssh_tunnel
:wq
# kill -1 1
#</code></pre></div><p>If you did everything right, you should have a reverse tunnel.&nbsp; To connect to your remote access point, use ssh from the host machine:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ssh -vv root@localhost -p 2201
OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config

debug1: Connecting to localhost [127.0.0.1] port 2201.
debug1: Connection established.
......
root@localhost&#039;s password:</code></pre></div><p>Even though the login says &#039;localhost&#039; it&#039;s really the Remote Access Point.&nbsp; Use the appropriate password.&nbsp; If you experience hangs during connection, experiment with increasing the number of seconds the ssh_tunnel sleeps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cptdondo</strong> on 10 Jan 2014, 17:23)</p>

					<p>Thanks @cptdondo for this awesome post.</p><p>If you have lots of remote access points to manage (let&#039;s say 20), how do you keep track of what AP is using what port?&nbsp; Do you do this manually, for instance AP one is using 2201 and AP two is using 2202, etc?</p><p>Just wondering if you have a more elegant solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>basically that&#039;s what I do.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually lower tech than that; I stick a label on each access point with the tunnel number on it so if I forget I can always have someone reality check it.</p><p>I guess you could do something fancy like scripted discovery but I just keep track of which port leads to which AP.&nbsp; I modified the luci intro screen on my main access point and added a list of access points and thier associated tunnels.</p><p>If it all fails, you can usually tell where you are by looking at the cpu info and the wireless setup.</p>									</div>
