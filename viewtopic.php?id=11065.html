					<p>Hello,<br />yesterday, I have upgrade firmware dd-wrt to openwrt kamikaze (7.06, brcm2.4 1 Jun 2007) in my&nbsp; WRT54GL v1.1,<br />This update was successful.<br />I have observe that nvram configuration was not default setting so I do this:<br />mtd -r erase nvram<br />I rebooting successfully. And all configuration work.<br />Today have modify somes options but now I can&#039;t connect on my wrt54gL (web, tftp, telnet, on lan, wan and wlan)<br />I want to reset it but now it not work.</p><p>I have tested some solutions<br />Plug in the router and wait for the DMZ LED to light up. Then immediately press and hold the reset button for 2 seconds. If done right the DMZ LED will quickly flash 3 times every second.</p><p>/!\ Holding the reset button before the DMZ LED turns on (i.e. when the bootloader is still running) can reset the NVRAM. Resetting the NVRAM will brick some models.</p><p>and other but the reset don&#039;t work.<br />The DMZ led go on but it not flash.!!</p><p>I don&#039;t know if the boot_wait is on because I have do mtd -r erase nvram</p><p>Now I have last solution but I want evoid it:<br />flash with PIN16 on mass.</p><p>Help me please.</p>									</div>

					<p>See the Hardware Wiki here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WHR-G54S?highlight=%28OpenWrtDocs/Hardware%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ardware%29</a></p><p>Some people just cut open a Nokia DKU-5 cable if they want a quick hookup for serial, it&#039;s got the chip for converting the 3.3V TTL signals of the router to what you need for PC.</p><p>Recommend you READ THE WIKI for documents like this one:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP?action=show&amp;redirect=OpenWrtViaTftp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins … WrtViaTftp</a></p><p>There are &quot;SEARCH&quot; buttons on both the Wiki and Forums where this ground has been covered many times.</p><p>Do not rush around erasing things and shorting out pins without knowledge of what you are doing, that is not smart.</p><p>9 times out of 10, even before learning to add serial console to routers, I have rescued bricked routers SIMPLY BY PERSISTENCE.</p><p>Put a switch between PC and router to keep link up.&nbsp; Keep trying different timing of power-up, send TFTP file.&nbsp; Sometimes it goes very quickly other times it takes many tries.</p><p>With serial console though it is usually much easier and quicker. And is only 3 (or 4) wires to solder on router, no big deal.&nbsp; The variant of serial port design I use is so simple I just add the jack for it, to every router that passes through my hands now.&nbsp; It was originated from JimWright and netprince, and is documented in section 3.1.2 of this page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … /WRTSL54GS</a></p><p>Here endeth the lesson.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 8 Jun 2007, 08:46)</p>

					<p>You really should have read the wiki.&nbsp; Kamikaze doesn&#039;t even use nvram, and erasing it is almost always a bad idea.</p>									</div>
