					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have the chance to get a <a href="http://www.dlink.co.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Product_C&amp;childpagename=DLinkEurope-GB%2FDLProductCarouselMultiple&amp;cid=1197388151238&amp;p=1197318962342&amp;packedargs=ParentPageID%3D1197318962321%26TopLevelPageProduct%3DConsumer%26locale%3D1195806691854%26packedargs%3DProductParentID%253D1195808621247&amp;pagename=DLinkEurope-GB%2FDLWrapper">D-Link DIR-652</a> with my new contract. Is it officially supported by OpenWRT? I couldn&#039;t find it on the supported devices page. I have read that it is basically a DIR-655 without the USB port. According to <a href="http://tumbetoene.tuxfamily.org/index.php?entry=entry110503-202525">this post</a> it comes with some version of OpenWRT. I would just like to be able to run the current version.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks it might get official OpenWrt support. Check out details from developers mailing list:<br /><a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.embedded.openwrt.devel/20790">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.em … evel/20790</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have also an DIR-652 Version A1. Since I flashed the newest FW (Firmware Version: 1.06) I have no more possibility for static routes on LAN-side. </p><p>There is a possibility explained here:</p><p><a href="http://www.hyllander.org/content/d-link-dir-655-how-create-static-route-lan">http://www.hyllander.org/content/d-link … -route-lan</a></p><p>But it will not work for me. There is an error message: &quot;Destination and Gateway should not reside on the same subnet 255.255.255.0&quot;</p><p>I try&nbsp; to tell this gateway, where to give IP-Packets for network: 192.168.220.0/24 to 192.168.178.99. This is my Lan-Gateway for Packets in this network.</p><p>Background: I try to build an multiple-WAN-Gateway. At the moment I try to use it out of my Desktop-Ubuntu.</p><p>Unfortunately it does only submit every second packet (average) into the 192.168.220.0/24 network. I tried other examples on other devices, so now I am pretty sure, the problem is, that DIR-652 route packets for network 192.168.220.0/24 into WAN insted into LAN-Side to 192.168.178.99.</p><p>So this is an big issue for me and let me try since to days and night to build an customize fw.</p><p>It is really impressive to see what you can chosse in the menu of uClinux und OpenWRT for this device. There is a README of DLink which describe how to get an definied own FW. Finally I got this step and have a ready compiled fw. But I can&#039;t try it at the moment, so perhaps some brave person try to test it?</p><p>It is for a DIR-652 Revision A1 with Ubicom 7150 CPU. When you compile D-LINK says you should choose DIR855 Layout (as described) because there is no specified DIR-652 Layout.</p><p>I would love to get OpenWRT work. Actually I saw there is even a driver for the LAN-Switch and Atheros-WIFI-Card in the GNU GPL attached.</p><p>Meanwhile I think to fix every error, but ther is still an one I can&#039;t find to compile OPENWRT and a customized uClinux.</p><p>I would love find some other people intersted to get it work! This machine seems to be really fast! Faster than the Nanostation M2 and mor flexible! The Chipset is also from Ubicom.</p><p>So why don&#039;t we develop a good customized Image? The original Image seems to have 6 MB and the flash can store 8 MB. So there is a little bit flexibility.</p><p>My goal is to get an ssh or telnet access to tell the device my static routes! Absolutely important for me is to keep WPA2-Encryption. So this article seems to be to complicate to come to a good successs.</p><p><a href="http://tumbetoene.tuxfamily.org/index.php?entry=entry110503-202525">http://tumbetoene.tuxfamily.org/index.p … 503-202525</a></p><p>Could anyone ask this developer to release his image for private purposes?</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p><p>At the moment I try to compile an OpenWRT-Image. My actual (for me) not solutionable failure is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Applying ./patches/602-ubicom32-disable-unsupported-wireless-settings.patch using plaintext:
