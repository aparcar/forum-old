					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Now that the Netgear R6250 is up and running (it should replace a DIR-615), I still got a few issues: speed, esp. download speeds are much lower than with the OEM DIR-615.<br />All from Speedtest.net on a max 50Mbps connection (well that&#039;s probably meant to be right at the VM Superhub).</p><p>R6250 (OpenWRT)<br />WLAN: down=10.96/2.51, up=2.79/3.15 (2 results)<br />LAN: 22.59, up=3.11 (best of three)</p><p>DIR-615 (OEM):<br />WLAN: down=16.71/26.28, up=3.12/3.16 (2 results)<br />LAN: down=30.66, up=3.12 (best of three)</p><p>While upload speeds are somehow consistent, download really varies and is lower on the new Netgear, esp via WiFi. There is a significant difference between WifI and LAN on both. But the Netgear seems to be a bit slower over all.<br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the hardware. So trying the settings:<br />Channels are set to &quot;auto&quot;, max range is set to 30m.<br />Anything else one could consider...? Or anyone with any similar experiences?</p><p>Stephan</p>									</div>
