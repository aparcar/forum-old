					<p>Hi!<br />First of all, I havn&#039;t installed OpenWrt on my router, and I don&#039;t plan to do so.<br />I just want to set a Dynamic DNS on it.<br />But there&#039;s a problem: I can only select DynDNS as provider!<br />So here&#039;s my question: How can I add a new Dynamic DNS provider?<br />I actually made some internet-research yet, but there&#039;s nothing specific for my router.<br />I only found this thread: <a href="http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/41576-43-dynamic-service-provider">http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/415 â€¦ e-provider</a><br />The post of Freetz is the interesting one: It shows us, as far as I can see, how we can get into the command console of our router via telnet! Then, how to modify some files and how to add a new dynamic DNS provider.<br />But it&#039;s for the WNDR3400v2. So I get stuck on step 3, I can&#039;t even mount mtd:rootfs.<br />And because I&#039;m not really in doing some Linux, I need your help.</p><p>Greets</p><p>Sorry for (eventually) bad english! :3</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried again and it worked somehow, but now I&#039;m stuck again:<br />How can I modify the files?

					<p>The V2 version is not well supported by OpenWrt due to its Broadcom chipset.&nbsp; The unit is completely different inside versus a V1 or V3 / V4.&nbsp; The stock firmware may not even be OpenWrt.</p><p>Consider trying the latest Netgear firmware if you haven&#039;t.&nbsp; They may have added more options.</p><p>Type mount with no options to see how things are mounted now.&nbsp; Usually the overlay disk (the writeable part of the root filesystem) is already rw.&nbsp; It will have a device name like /dev/mtdblock3 (assuming the firmware is OpenWrt).</p><p>You have a larger problem that the vi editor is apparently not present in the firmware.&nbsp; The only way to edit a file may be to save it from your web browser, edit on your PC then use the snarf or wget web-page downloader (if it has either of those) to copy it back to the router.&nbsp; This method would require setting up a web server on your PC.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 10 Jan 2015, 07:27)</p>
