					<p>For samba3 I figured out how to tune it well.&nbsp; First delete /etc/config/samba.&nbsp; Then edit /etc/samba/smb.conf to what you want to setup.<br />Key features that helped my transfer speeds is to use vfat,ext3, or ext4; as NTFS-3g can be slow as it is cpu limited.&nbsp; When is overclocking going to be available for the G300NH????<br />Add this to the [global] section:</p><p><strong>socket options =&nbsp; &nbsp;TCP_NODELAY SO_KEEPALIVE IPTOS_LOWDELAY</strong></p><p>As for the permissions, I had similar issues.&nbsp; If I run my backup script, the files show up with permissions for root, and my samba use is under nobody:nogroup, so the files created in putty don&#039;t seem to be accessible, but anything I create in samba through windows has proper permissions.&nbsp; This worked for me, it allows me to delete, edit, add files to folders owned by root (which were created during a backup script on the router):</p><br /><p><strong>[usb]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; path = /mnt/usb<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; browseable = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; user = nobody<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; writeable = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; read only = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; create mask = 0777<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; directory mask = 0777</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robnitro</strong> on 18 Sep 2010, 19:21)</p>

					<p>yeah, how do you edit or delete files thought telnet or ssh, I did get my shared folder writable except a weird thing happened, I disconnected my drive to move it to a permanent place on my desk and when I plugged it back in the pics and music I transfered to it were gone but the drive spaced still showed up as being used, also does anyone know how to format a drive with ext3 while its connected to the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>from the little reading I&#039;ve done on google it sounds like a problem with the whole kmod-usb2 package but if I remove that package my usb drive won&#039;t mount although it should be compatible with whichever package was the 1.1 drivers.
