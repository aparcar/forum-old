					<p><em>warning: I&#039;m new.</em></p><p>I have two cheap wifi extenders that are the &quot;plug into the wall, and they are hops for the wifi signal that create a new AP - and optionally use the ethernet port to connect up a non-wifi device.&quot;&nbsp; </p><p>They aren&#039;t working too great in my in-laws&#039; house, their router is in the basement and the wifi can&#039;t make it out to the yard.&nbsp; The device FAQs also explicitly say &quot;don&#039;t plug in a cable between the router and the device, it will just mess things up, that port is just for plugging in non-wifi devices.&quot;</p><p>I was wondering: is there a way to do exactly that?&nbsp; Can I put my own firmware on the device that repurposes the ethernet port to plug a long ethernet cable to the router, take that hop out of the picture, and then position the extender somewhere up high?</p>									</div>

					<p>The EX2700 should be supported.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/netgear_ex2700">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/netgear_ex2700</a></p><p>With OpenWrt the configuration of a &quot;dumb AP&quot; goes as follows:</p><p>Devices such as the EX2700 with only one Ethernet port start off configured with just a LAN network, and the port accessible to this network at 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; This is mostly what you want, though you will almost certainly need to change the address.<br />Give device an IP address that is in the range of the main router, but doesn&#039;t conflict with any of the other devices in the network.&nbsp; Set gateway and DNS to the IP of your main router.<br />Make sure the &quot;Turn off DHCP&quot; box for the LAN is checked.<br />Configure wifi and enable it.&nbsp; If you use the same SSID and encryption as the main router, users will generally connect to whichever one is initially stronger without needing to reconfigure.<br />Save and apply all these changes, then disconnect the cable you were using to configure direct from your PC, and plug into the main router instead.</p>									</div>

					<p>fantastic news, thank you!&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m realizing I know less than I thought, so I asked a follow-up question in superuser.com/questions/1159130/installing-openwrt-on-a-netgear-ex2700-wifi-extender-bin-vs-img</p><p>(do I need to compile stuff?&nbsp; Is there an easy way to do this?)</p>									</div>
