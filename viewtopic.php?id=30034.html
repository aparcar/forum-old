					<p>Made some progress today. I got my usb hdd share viewable from Ubuntu, WinXP, and my Xbox. </p><p>The only thing I did different was I used ext3 instead of ext4 when formating the usb hdd. I have no idea if that had anything to do with my problem or not but I&#039;m just happy the share is now viewable. Also, Instead of changing workgroup to &#039;workgroup&#039;, I just left it as &#039;OpenWrt&#039;. Again,&nbsp; I have no idea if that had anything to do with the original problem.</p><p>Still having problems though. This it has to do with permissions. </p><p>With the tmp share, I can create and delete folders and files but with the usb hdd share I can only view whatever is already there and can&#039;t modify, create, del, etc.</p><p>Any help would be great.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Keypel</strong> on 17 May 2011, 05:38)</p>
