					<p>Hello</p><p>I&#039;m trying to apply a kernel patch regarding the ath9k module and followed the wiki article for that.(<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/">Working with patches</a>)</p><p>The problem I&#039;m experiencing is the following, the changes don&#039;t seem to be included in the compilation, although the files in the build directory have the patched content. I am assuming that somehow those files are not used, as of right now, I added some gibberish that should produce an error during compilation, all in a patch. I can see the changes, but the compilation goes through without an error, which should not be the case. The file I added the gibberish to is the debug.c for ath9k.</p><p>Can someone help me with this or can see a mistake I am making? I am really confused right now.</p><p>Kind regards<br />Kacha</p>									</div>

Once you have done that, you can use any text editor to edit the file patched by quilt to see if the <em>quilt push</em> has made the changes to the file. If not, then there is something wrong with your patched file. Otherwise, proceed as explain above by hnyman.</p>									</div>
