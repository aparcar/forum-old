					<p>I was looking throught the forum, to find a way to mount an smb NAS drive, but didn&#039;t had success.</p><p>smbmount is not a part of the samba-client package, however someone here posted an smbmount test package for RC5 or so (link broken).</p><p>Is there a proper way to make 7.07 know about smbfs? Or just to compile it for my own?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Viperboy</strong> on 6 Aug 2007, 22:13)</p>
