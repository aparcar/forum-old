					<p>Hello, </p><p>I would like to know how Luci gets the wifi channels and display them . I mean, what is the directory where lies the functions for getting the channels and displaying it?</p><p>I have found in /usr/lib/lua/luci/model/network.lua a function that retreives the channel from the device, but I don&#039;t know how or what function assigns the value of the channel to a concrete frequency on the Luci; for instnace, how does the luci know that channel 36 has a frequency of 5180GHz? Does it take from the iw list?</p><p>Thanks in advnace!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ndarkness</strong> on 5 Apr 2013, 12:21)</p>
