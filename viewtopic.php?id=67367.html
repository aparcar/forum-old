					<p>Hello. I have an OpenWRT router with a 3G USB Stick for WAN. It does nothing for the moment, apart from a SSH reverse tunnel to a remote Linux Server. It is active 24/7 and the problem is that data 3G consumption is about 25 MB/day, so 750 MB/Month doing nothing.</p><p>The command is this, with a keepalive 60 seconds.<br />-----------<br />/usr/bin/ssh -K 60 -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa -N -T -R *:50022:127.0.0.1:22 -R *:50080:127.0.0.1:80 user@myserver.com -y<br />-------------</p><p>Is this data consumption OK? What is the explanation or breakdown?</p>									</div>

I am going to put an ip camera. 3G is behind NAT so I have to open a port in the remote server with a SSH tunnel. I thought 1GB/Month would be enough&nbsp; to see occasionally the camera and to receive motion alerts, but I see that the reverse tunnel is getting itself all the bandwidth.&nbsp; 25MB/Day is about 0.3K/s. I don&#039;t understand why are needed 300 bytes/second to keep a TCP and a SSH Tunnel without activity, so I wanted to know if this is normal or maybe there is something wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>You have a keep-alive of 60 seconds, which means that at least 2 ip packets are send per minute. The keep alive signal itself, and the &#039;ACK&#039; response. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if both packages, possibly encapsulated, take 300 bytes.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wouldn&#039;t blame SSH or anything else to do with communication...</p><p>Blame the ISP because they are the gatekeepers putting limits on imaginary numbers that mean virtually nothing.</p><p>Another method which might use less bandwidth would be to use the Camera&#039;s HTTP/s interface. Configure the camera&#039;s interface to take credentials, and configure the router to port forward to the camera. From there, just set up the router to use dynamic DNS, so you can use a resolvable hostname to connect to the camera. IPTables can be set up to only allow certain subnets to connect to the camera... say the ISP subnet your 1st home is on.</p><p>The above solution uses Zero bandwidth except on demand video viewing.</p><p>P.S. I use changeIP.com for ddns witch is absolutely free.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 5 Sep 2016, 01:09)</p>

					<p>davidc502: openning a port on 3g won&#039;t help, mobile operators don&#039;t give out public IPs. You can pay public IP for extra monthly fee, but it is not cheap.</p><p>Is the keep alive really needed? I don&#039;t uise ssh tunnels, but If I open ssh connection in putty to my router, it does not close day long, and I&#039;m behind nat too, not on 3g though. I have zero data flowing with idle but open ssh connection, yet it keeps open.</p><p>You can try sixxs or some kind of vpn, maybe it will use less data.</p>									</div>

					<p>the problem with WWAN connections these days is that you only get a rfc1918(private) IP address that is NATed behind a public IP and you don&#039;t have a way to configure port forwarding and ddns.<br />for on-topic recommendations you could try setting up openvpn or tinc with keepalive 60sec or even 120s<br />for openvpn at least it&#039;s just a 74 ICMP data bytes request + 74 reply =&gt; you get about ~150 bytes every 1 or 2 minute(s)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maurer</strong> on 5 Sep 2016, 11:17)</p>

					<p>I think you should try to go with openvpn using udp. That should save you some bandwidth as udp protocol is simpler so there should be less overhead maintaining the tunnel.</p>									</div>
