					<p>When you say DB9, do you mean to a RS232 serial port (usb or real)?&nbsp; In that case you might not be dealing with TTL voltage levels on the PC side, and may have a device which is expecting &quot;inverted&quot; rather than the &quot;true&quot; voltage levels which the Hame MPR A2 is putting out.&nbsp; You need a ttl serial device like this:&nbsp; </p><p><a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/New-USB-2-0-to-TTL-UART-6PIN-Module-Serial-Converter-CP2102-STC-PRGMR-Free-cable-/171344904806?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27e4f3c266">http://www.ebay.ca/itm/New-USB-2-0-to-T â€¦ 27e4f3c266</a></p><p>If your device used standard RS232 voltage levels, it is possible that the MPR A2 could have been damaged.</p>									</div>

					<p>Finally I managed to get my device back by flashing one of original HAME binaries.

					<p>Where were you able to get the original Hame binaries for the A2? I can&#039;t seem to find them. In the website they only have the A1 firmwares.

					<p>What&#039;s the status of your repair? Were you able to make it work? I also used the same files as you and now I&#039;m stuck with the faint blue light as well.

I did this by entering failsafe mode (reset key pressed + power on the router) and using the program (downloaded from ofmodemsandmen.com/downloads.html).<br /> Now, when I try to open the router in normal mode or failsafe mode, only the the blue led is lith but it&#039;s dim, not bright.
