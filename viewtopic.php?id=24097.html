					<p>Is there currently any work being done on fixing the JFFSS marker problem (#5071) for the WRT54G v1.1 devices? I know everyone is busy, just curious if we might be able to see a fix by the final release. Thanks!</p>									</div>

It is up to us to install and use and figure out what does and doesn&#039;t work, report that back so it can be fixed in the final release. That&#039;s not to say that a final release will necessarily be problem free and work with every router out there but a final release should at least be documented as to which routers it is known to work with (supported hardware page) and any known problems. There is a link in the original post that lists the bugs. If you think your issue is not documented I believe the right thing to do is submit a bug report. Hopefully someone will correct me if I am wrong about that.</p><p>P.S. I don&#039;t know exactly what you mean by &quot;didn&#039;t even install the wifi&quot; and I don&#039;t have a router like yours so I can&#039;t test it but Wifi is not enabled by default. Did you try to enable it? Otherwise search the bug database and report it if it&#039;s not there.</p>									</div>
