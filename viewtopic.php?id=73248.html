					<p>There is a 3rd &quot;hidden&quot; radio in this model. I belive it was reserved for radar detection. As radar detection uses band 2 and a bit of band 1 of the 2.4/5GHz spectrum, there is overlap into WiFi. Indeed,In DD-WRT fw the radio shows up as &quot;ath2&quot; device and is fully configurable and works perfectly with my 5GHz wifi clients. So having three radios is fantastic , tri band! , and I can distribute clients across the 3 bands to maximse throughput/efficiency.</p><p>However, this thirs radio doesnt appear in OpenWrt , LEDE or any derivative.</p><p>Could we get this functionality in please.</p>									</div>

					<p>It was not meant to explain the loss of the 3rd radio, it was meant to explain the reason that it was removed from the community build. There is a possible conflict if you configure things incorrectly, does not matter what release you use, LEDE/DD-Wrt.</p><p>If it actually is not in the stable or snapshot images(don&#039;t use them), does not take much to install the above ipk files. But I know that doing a build for mvebu targets, OOTB the third radio packages are enabled by default.</p>									</div>
