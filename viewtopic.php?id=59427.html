					<p>I have installed miniupnp on my OpenWrt router, and the uTorrent client on my Windows machine can open ports on the router correctly and transfer data through the ports.</p><p>But Transmission seems unable to open ports with uPnP at all. I tried to restart the daemon, but there&#039;s no ports opened.

					<p>I have not found where to check the log...can you give me a hint?</p><p>I have searching the solution for a while, and I realize that maybe I do not need uPnP. Because I am running Transmission on my OpenWRT router, I do not need port forwarding in this case. I tried to open a port on my router by editing the firewall rule, but still does not work. I also tried different ports to roll out ISP blocking.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Newtman,</p><p>I think we all made the same mistake. To ran transmission on OpenWrt, you do not need uPnP at all.
