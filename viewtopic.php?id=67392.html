					<p>I&#039;m facing same problem with the make-extfs file not being available. I&#039;ve located one on github[dot]com/08opt/dl-1/blob/master/make-ext4fs-2016-05-05.tar.gz, is there a way to point the build process to that one?</p><p>EDIT:<br />I&#039;ve changed the PKG_VERSION variable in tools/make-ext4fs/Makefile to 2016-04-25 and the make process seems to be working now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mherceg</strong> on 7 Sep 2016, 10:53)</p>
