					<p>Hi,</p><p>I bought an all0239-3g router which seems to be supported by OpenWRT, at least the TOH (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a>) says, that the device is supported. <br />Has anyone installed OpenWRT on this device before? There are no installation notices for the device, the only pre-build file I found is&quot;<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt305x/openwrt-ramips-rt305x-all0239-3g-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_ … pgrade.bin</a>&quot;. I am new to OpenWRT and skimmed the Wiki for information on how to flash devices. As far as I know, I need a &quot;factory&quot; image to flash the device using the OEM-Webupdater, but this image is not provided anywhere. <br />Do ist just have to upload the linked file above to the router using the OEM-Interface or am I going to brick it like that?</p><br /><p>Regards,</p><p>tmp</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmp</strong> on 29 Jan 2015, 21:27)</p>

					<p>Ok, I have been curious and just tried to flash the upgrade to OpenWrt using the Webflash-Application. It just works. <br />I used this image: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt305x/openwrt-ramips-rt305x-all0239-3g-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_ … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>Just flash it using the OEM Firmware-Upgrade Page, wait for the restart and there you go. Even luci is already enabled.</p>									</div>

					<p>So just to repeat it: you flashed it via the WebUI System Upgrade - not by Telnet?<br />Because in the TOH on top there is said the author messed up his router by flashing via WebUI...</p><p>By the way does the 3G still work on OpenWRT?</p>									</div>
