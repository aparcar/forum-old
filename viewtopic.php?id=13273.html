					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a WRTSL54GS running WhiteRussian 0.9 as my router.<br />I am able to send DCC file transfers over IRC without any issues.<br />However, I am unable to receive DCC transfers from others.</p><p>My router is performing NAT for my internal network.</p><p>I have loaded the following modules in an attempt to fix the problem:<br />root@wrtsl54gs:~# lsmod | grep ipt<br />ipt_REDIRECT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;640&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)<br />ipt_MIRROR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1296&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)<br />ipt_conntrack&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1104&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)<br />ipt_connbytes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 624&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)<br />ipt_connmark&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;352&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)<br />ipt_helper&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;560&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)<br />ipt_CONNMARK&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;816&nbsp; &nbsp;0 (unused)</p><p>I have tried to force the DCC port my IRC client uses to 7666, and specifically forwarded it through my router to my internal system.</p><p>I have also tried configuring my IRC client to use my external &quot;real&quot; IP address with no success.</p><p>I have the following IPTables rules in my firewall:<br />iptables -P INPUT DROP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP<br />iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN SYN --tcp-option \! 2 -j&nbsp; DROP</p><p>iptables -P FORWARD DROP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state INVALID -j DROP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pm<br />iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In addition to the standard masquerade entries, and some user-defined port forwardings.</p><p>Hopefully, someone can point out something obvious that I&#039;ve missed, and I&#039;ll gladly feel like a fool for missing it as long as I can get this fixed.&nbsp; I spend quite a bit of time on IRC, and the inability to receive DCC files is quite annoying.</p><p>If there is any further information you might need to help troubleshoot my problem, I&#039;ll gladly provide it.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
