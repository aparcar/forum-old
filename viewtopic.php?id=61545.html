					<p>I was trying to make a captive portal with nodogshow and wifi dog. After a few days of trying to get it to work, I ran out of time to play with it and just restored the factory image I downloaded from Linksys. I hooked it up back the way everything was but now my downloads are only about 36Mb instead of 100Mb+. </p><p>Now, granted, this is for an active business and I had only one shot at this so I unplugged the modem and router, hooked them back up in that order before restarting one of two computers hooked to the router but that&#039;s all I had time to do.</p><p>I also found they had issues accessing some files wirelessly between an Android tablet and one of the computers.</p><p>I would have thought none of the settings I changed while using wifidog and nodogshow would affect this when I went back to the factory image. Am I wrong? Or does anyone have any insight into this?</p><p>I realize I need to go back later tonight and reset the modem, etc., and test again but would like to know if anyone is aware of such issues.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m pretty sure that the config files for openwrt are being integrated into the linksys firmware cause trying to access 192.168.1.1 tries to go to /cgi-bin/luci. Also, I was able to get very slow wifi internet access but no wired access. I was able to get linksys to switch to &quot;a previous firmware version&quot; but that was openwrt. So I reinstalled the linksys firmware using openwrt but I&#039;m back to the same issues ... only worse.</p><p>Now, if I go to linksyssmartwifi.com, it says there is no page there but there is no other link to go to. I can&#039;t recall if I&#039;m actually at 192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci again or not.</p><p>So I&#039;m stuck and don&#039;t know what to do.</p><p>At one point, I was able to run through the wifi setup but, when it was done, it said, &quot;You are not connected to your router&quot;. Obviously I was so I turned off wifi and it still couldn&#039;t connect.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drhowarddrfine</strong> on 16 Dec 2015, 07:36)</p>
