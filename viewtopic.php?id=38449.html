					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m having a problem with some strange dependencies in an older release (r32854), but this have also happened to me in the latest trunk:</p><p>I compile the binaries, I choose some I2C kernel module packages to be part of the image (kmod-i2c-algo-bit and kmod-i2c-core), but it seems they are not included. I then go to the trunk/bin/atheros/packages and download the .ipk files to the router and then try to install it manually. However, some of them fail because it seems there is a dependency of a specific kernel version.</p><p>Well, if everything was compiled all together, why am I having this dependency problem?</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# wget http://192.168.2.10/kmod-i2c-core_3.3.8-1_atheros.ipk

					<p>&quot;make clean&quot; first to ensure that the kernel and all the modules surely get built at the same time. The dependecy logic regarding kernel options was changed a few months ago to a too strict dependency checking and it is pretty difficult to get it right for kmod modules unless you compile everything from scratch on the same run.</p><p>Alternatively use opkg&#039;s force option to ignore dependencies for modules you know to be suitable.</p><p>Also regularly use make defconfig or make menuconfig to make sure that all changes in module dependencies get taken into the .config</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 3 Aug 2012, 13:49)</p>
