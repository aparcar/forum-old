					<p>Hi i recently made the &quot;mmc mod&quot; on my linksys wrt54gl wich is running the last stable release of openwrt (8.09.1).<br />I used the optimized driver found here (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/customizing/hardware/mmc-v1.3.4-gpio2.tgz">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/oldwiki/ â€¦ -gpio2.tgz</a>) as the package kmod-broadcom-mmc does not seems to work (at least for me).</p><p>After that i edited some others file in order to make my external storage mount automatically at every boot:<br />1)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;mmc&quot; &gt; /etc/modules.d/80-mmc</code></pre></div><p>2)<br />Then:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vi /etc/rc.d/S20gpiomask</code></pre></div><p>where i put<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;0x9c&quot; &gt; /proc/diag/gpiomask</code></pre></div><p>3)<br />Finally i edited /etc/config/fstab where i added at the end of file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config mount
        option target    /mnt
        option device   /dev/mmc/disc0/part1
        option fstype    ext3
        option options  rw,sync,noatime
        option enabled  1</code></pre></div><p>At the boot all seems to work perfectly but i noticed that the power led, the dmz led and the &quot;secure wifi&quot; button led crazily starts to blink every time the external media is accessed.<br />I checked with dmesg and top and i does not to seems that hotplug events are generated (so it should not be a problem related with gpiomask).</p><p>This &quot;crazy blinking&quot; is really annoing: i can&#039;t check my lan and wan status looking my router&#039;s led!!! <br />Someone know a fix for this?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>I dare say you&#039;ll find it is a &#039;design feature&#039; as you hijack the signals to these leds in order to drive the sd/mmc card.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it&#039;s useful just like a hard drive led blinks when I use it... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />btw mine reacts the same way it&#039;s also a wrt54gl..</p><p>I used another driver in the past and it didn&#039;t do it but it was much slower and it did turned the led on all the time...</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, thanks for your advices and sorry for my late answer (but the openwrt site was not available in the last 3 days at least for me).<br />The only thing i can&#039;t understand is why the power led keep fast blinking when the router is in idle (no one is connected or is making some lan or wan traffic).</p><p>If you have any advices i will really appreciate them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skumpic</strong> on 24 Aug 2009, 14:05)</p>
