					<p>Either you set the ISP device to be a router only, in which case you need more than one public IPs (typically five are provided), or you set the ISP device to behave only as a modem and attach to it from OpenWRT via PPPoE, or you use OpenWRT only as a WiFi AP. It really depends what you want to achieve.</p>									</div>
