					<p>ysidhu,</p><p>Are you telneting in on the wan interface instead of the lan interface? If so, the firewall blocks telnet. You pretty much have to telnet in from the lan (or wifi) unless you change the firewall. On a WRT54G(S) that would be one of the four ports right next to each other. Not the port set off by itself. Once you telnet in, you can change the password and then you can ssh into any port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, if I can&#039;t telnet in I use a serial console to set the password. Serial console saves me every time, no matter what the problem! ... pretty much.</p><p>If you don&#039;t have one / too lazy to build one (which I would recommend you do), try ... umm ... can you get the webif (I&#039;m assuming this is WhiteRussian; you shouldn&#039;t be trying Kamikaze without a console)? If so, did you set the password on the webif? If so, that&#039;s what you use to SSH in (from the LAN).&nbsp; To SSH from the WAN, you might need to edit /etc/firewall.user; for me the default is *NO* WAN SSH.</p><p>Anyway, good luck.</p><p> - Yasha</p>									</div>
