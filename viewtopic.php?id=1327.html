The only obstacle i see is, that (IIRC) there&#039;s no standard wireless extension interface for a WPA authenticator. The WPA interface in there seems to be for the supplicant only. So we&#039;d probably have to choose another common driver to emulate. Should be possible, though.<br />You should really switch to the &#039;experimental&#039; branch (which, I think, can be called stable now), unless you&#039;re using older v1 Hardware (there&#039;s a bug in newer ethernet drivers that we haven&#039;t fixed yet).</p>									</div>
