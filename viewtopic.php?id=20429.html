					<p>hi<br />I&#039;m running x-wrt 8.09 (final) as main router for my house, with the ip 192.168.0.99, I&#039;m running a debian server (ip 192.168.0.101) with openvpn server on it (ip 192.168.25.1), and finally I&#039;ve other PC in my house. when I&#039;m connected to openvpn (client ip 192.168.25.2) I can ping the server (192.168.25.1 and 192.168.0.101) and the router (192.168.0.99), but i can&#039;t ping other ip in the network. (I&#039;ve activated ipv4 routing on debian and created the route on the router)<br />i think the problem is that the packet go to the server, the server route it to the ip (lets say 192.168.0.3), the computer behind 192.168.0.3 doesn&#039;t known the source (192.168.25.2) so it send the answer (pong <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ) to 192.168.0.99 finally 192.168.0.99 drop this answer because it haven&#039;t show the question<br />There are my questions, is there a way to configure xwrt to work with my LAN or have you any idea to modifie my LAN organization<br />thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>In addition to the static route on the router, you&#039;ll also need to allow forwarding between the two zones in the firewall.</p><p>Edit: you may need to create the firewall zone here. I&#039;m not 100% familiar with the x-wrt firewall app.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thalience</strong> on 25 May 2009, 04:07)</p>
