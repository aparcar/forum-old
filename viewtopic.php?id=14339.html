					<p>Yes.</p><p>SSH to the router and find out the following nvram settings:</p><p>nvram get vlan0ports<br />nvram get vlan1ports<br />nvram get wan_device<br />nvram get wan_ifname<br />nvram get lan_ifname<br />nvram get lan_ifnames</p><p>It will probably look something like this:</p><p>vlan0ports=3 2 1 0 5*<br />vlan1ports=4 5<br />wan_device=vlan1<br />wan_ifname=vlan1<br />lan_ifname=br0<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0 eth1 eth2</p><p>This means that port 0-5 except 4 are in vlan0 and ports 4 and 5 are in vlan1.<br />vlan1 is the &quot;wan&quot; and &quot;lan&quot; is a bridge consisting of vlan0 and the wifi (eth1.)<br />You can ignore eth2, since it doesn&#039;t exist.</p><p>The above is from a WRT54GL, but it should be similar on your router.&nbsp; The port numbers might be switched around, though.</p><p>Port 5 is the internal connection to the CPU.&nbsp; i.e. it is not a port on the back of the router.</p><p>So in the case of the router I got the values from, port 4 is the WAN port.&nbsp; If you just remove one port (not port 5) from vlan0ports and add it to vlan1ports, that should solve your problem.</p><p>e.g.:</p><p>nvram set vlan0ports=&quot;2 1 0 5*&quot;<br />nvram set vlan1ports=&quot;3 5&quot;<br />nvram commit<br />reboot</p><p>That should make port 3 the WAN port.&nbsp; You will have to test to see which port on the back is port 3, because the numbers on the back do not necessarily match with the numbers in nvram.</p>									</div>
