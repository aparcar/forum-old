					<p>I have an TP-Link Archer C7 and i&#039;d like to install openWRT (which i never did before). So far i have learned that my version is not ideal for openWRT. Currently the main reason for switching from stock to OpenWRT is the fact that i want a DNS Server and like to provide a VPN Service through my router. <br />On this page i&#039;ve read something that might stop the whole thing.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/ar … c7-wdr7500</a></p><p>&quot;Furthermore, please be aware that OpenWrt firmware does not support the hardware NAT capability of these routers. Hence, the throughput between WAN↔LAN will be slower than with stock firmware. This is only important for users with highspeed internet connections, like e.g. a 1G fibre connection. If your internet connection is ⇐200Mbps you don&#039;t need to worry about this (maybe even up to 300Mbps)&quot;</p><br /><p>Is that still the case? My &quot;problem&quot; is that i do have a symmetric 1Gbit fiber connection. If so i&#039;ll stay with the stock firmware.<br />I have two devices that are online pretty much 24/7. A Raspberry Pi Model B (Raspbian) that i use as a printer server and my HP Proliant Microserver (Debian Jessie). Is it ok to run dnsmasq and openVPN on the Raspberry Pi or should i go for the server? I&#039;d expect the VPN performance to be rather poor on the Pi.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>felixm</strong> on 14 Jan 2017, 00:04)</p>

					<p>Pi&#039;s are pretty lousy for high-speed networking since the ethernet chip is only 100Mb and if you want to add another, it is all funneled through one USB2 connection to the CPU.&nbsp; If your want to keep up Gb performance end to end, you&#039;ll need something with a lot more CPU than the C7, like a multi-core X86 box.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 14 Jan 2017, 00:45)</p>

					<p>Which would mean I&#039;d have to use my Server. It has two eth devices and also enough CPU Power. <br />Well. Since i am going to get a apu2c4 sometime in 2017 this is only am temporary solution.</p>									</div>
