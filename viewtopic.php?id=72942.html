					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to get 11w working, to fend of the local script kiddy :-(. But to no avail.</p><p>I&#039;ve to set up 11w via luci and set it to required.&nbsp; Win10 and Andriod are able to connect nicely. Ubuntu and OpenWrt cannot connect as clients. Noting in the logs. Just &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot;</p><p>I&#039;m using a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v4. Which led me to OpenWrt trunk. </p><p>Installed LUCI, WPAD full and removed WPAD-mini. </p><p>Then with a Image generator from openwrt trunk (now archive). And now with trunk from LEDE (current openwrt trunk). 4-1-2018.<br />OpenWrt SNAPSHOT r5677-da95c9a / LuCI Master (git-18.003.32380-b121f95) <br />&quot;make image PROFILE=tl-wr1043nd-v4 PACKAGES=&quot;wpad luci squeezelite-full -wpad-mini&quot;</p><p>Alas to no avail. Both master and client are now running this version.</p><p>Tips anyone?</p><p>N.B. Building from, new, trunk required some Frankenstein-ing Trunk holds an old libuci-lua &lt;2018 and missed opkg. Grabbed both 17.05. Oddly 17.05 contains a newer libuci-lua than trunk? Trunk is missing a few updated package builds by the looks of it.</p><p>I&#039;ve set up a additional wireless master with SSID &quot;Nog1DeauthAanvalEnIkKomJePakken&quot;. Translated: &quot;1MoreDeauthAttactAndImCommingForYou&quot;. Let&#039;s hope he gets the message.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Falcon1</strong> on 5 Jan 2018, 21:06)</p>
