Most of the memory will be used to store skbs (network packets) in kernel space for routing and traffic shaping and the like. I heard some rumor that 32-bit x86 can only access something like 1GB in kernel space. True?</p>									</div>

					<p>Portwell makes some interesting boxes as well e.g. <a href="http://www.portwell.com/products/detail.asp?CUSTCHAR1=KILIN-6005">http://www.portwell.com/products/detail … KILIN-6005</a> . Geting this to run OpenWRT might be handfull though...</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want to build yourself, Supermicro has some nice 4-port boards with intel gigabit on all 4 ports.&nbsp; The PDSMi-LN4+ is a little older, but I&#039;ve used the PDSMI+ line for a couple years with Gentoo/XEN and OpenBSD pf (not to be confused with OpenWRT) with great results.&nbsp; They have a nice line of 1u cases with power supply, including a tiny 14&quot; deep one - that this fits nicely.</p><p>One you go main style desktop:&nbsp; As for compact flash, I&#039;d say go with USB 2.0 FLASH, USB 2.0 SDHC adapters, or SSD via SATA.&nbsp; Most modern systems can boot file from USB flash or USB 2.0 SDHC if you get a decent USB to SDHC adapter.</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Forgot that the <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon3000/3000/PDSMi-LN4+.cfm">http://www.supermicro.com/products/moth … i-LN4+.cfm</a> has built-in Compact Flash support.</p><p>Although I haven&#039;t frequented it for over a year, the Web Hosting Talk (WHT) forum is a good place to compare notes.&nbsp; been a year since I&#039;ve purchased Supermicro, but eWiz used to be best prices in the USA.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoundSparrow</strong> on 8 Feb 2009, 21:12)</p>
