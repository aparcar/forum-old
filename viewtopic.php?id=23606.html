					<p>Hello, </p><p>I need to setup wrt to do this. User must connect with putty on ssh port and router must forward communication to another IP:port. Communication between putty and router is encrypted over ssh but after port-forwarding it can go unencrypted.</p><p>Examlple:<br />first user: putty user to router (ssh on 192.168.1.1:100) and it forwards communication to x.x.x.x:400<br />second user: putty user to router (ssh on 192.168.1.1:200) and it forwards communication to y.y.y.y:400<br />etc</p><p>thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, first, SSH is encrypted. </p><p>Second, why not just port forward the SSH port to the internal computer. No need to have them connect to the router via SSH and then have some special process on there to redirect it to another internal system unencrypted.</p>									</div>

					<p>The main idea is that user from internet with putty will connect to router - router must authenticate user and then forward his communication to other ip:port in internet. Communication from router to other ip:port is unencrypted. So only communication between router and putty is encrypted over ssh. Router should verificate user&#039;s credentials and then forward his communication...</p>									</div>
