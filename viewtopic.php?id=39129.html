					<p>OK</p><p>Does anyone know what voltages the WNDR3700 uses on it&#039;s internal circuitry?</p><p>The WRT54G did a step down from the external 12v supply to an internal 3.3V for it&#039;s power usage, if the WNDR3700 is also using 3.3v internally then there must be a voltage regulator.</p><p>Any help here would be much appreciated guys.</p>									</div>

					<p>Measure the voltage of the adapter. And post a hi-res photo of the power supply zone.<br />Surely it has a switching step-down converter, usually accepting voltages of at least 16V.<br />There are two small chips near the power plug. Make a photo of them and check its codes.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/1950/imagefwm.png" alt="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/1950/imagefwm.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 7 Sep 2012, 01:32)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s not clear whether your question was answered or not. The board does use switching regulators. So it should tolerate a fairly wide range of input voltage without issue. The regulators are spec&#039;d up to 18 V input, but also check the voltage rating of the large-ish capacitor nearest the power input jack. I&#039;d be surprised if it is less than 25 V but it may be 16 V. So don&#039;t exceed the lower of 18 V or the rating of that capacitor, and you should be fine. Car battery will be about 13.8 V fully charged, but as high as 14.4 V or so when the engine is running. That should be fine.</p>									</div>
