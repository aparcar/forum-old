					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am now trying to set up my net5501 as a wireless access point to an existing network. Basically, I am in a room with no wireless and only one network jack. I want to plug my net5501 into the jack via eth0, and then plug other computers into the other ports and also use the wireless card installed to the net5501, but all the computers and devices need to use the main dhcp instead of the net5501 as a dhcp, so I just need to connect pass all the devices to the network jack on eth0. What are the settings to do this?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>As jow said, use the LAN ports. </p><p>I find the easiest way is removing </p><p>/etc/rc.d/S60dnsmasq </p><p>which prevents the DHCP server from starting up. Guess you could mod it also in /etc/config/dhcp, but I just remove the startup in /etc/rc.d. </p><p>On the next reboot, the DHCP server does not start up.</p><p>You may get into trouble with problems downloading ipkg packages afterwards. Since I now use the LAN ports to connect to the network, the router itself does not know how to connect to find the way to the internet (try pinging an external address from the command line interface on the router). The computers connected to it has no problem, since they now get the routing information from the DHCP server in my network. So to tell the router that it should use LAN ports to connect to the internet, we change the routing table like this (assuming your network gateway is 192.168.50.1)</p><p>route add -net default gw 192.168.50.1 dev br-lan</p><p>Now, a ping to an external address like vg.no should return answers. </p><p>NOTE: The specified gateway must be reachable first. This usually means that you have to set up a static route to the gateway beforehand. If you specify the address of one of your local interfaces, it will be used to decide about the interface to which the packets should be routed to. This is a BSDism compatibility hack. For more info, see <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/route">http://linux.die.net/man/8/route</a>. </p><p>NOTE: If you want to (or rather, need to) utilize the WAN port as an extra LAN port, you will propably need to modify the switch config in /etc/config/network as well and add the WAN port to the same VLAN as the LAN ports.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>karsteb</strong> on 11 Aug 2011, 02:01)</p>
