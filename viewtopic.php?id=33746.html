					<p>I&#039;m using Backfire 10.03 with a WRT54G, using the b43 driver with the 2.6 kernel (one of the standard images). Things are pretty standardly set up, nothing weird.</p><p>Every now and then (roughly once a week) the wifi just drops; devices can&#039;t associate with it. Logging in to the router (using ethernet) and running the &#039;wifi&#039; command makes everything work again, but obviously this isn&#039;t ideal.</p><p>Any suggestions how to find what&#039;s wrong? I don&#039;t know how to enable relevant logging to see where the problem might lie, so any suggestions about directions to try would be very much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
