					<p>I&#039;m trying to set up a batman-adv mesh network on Bullet M2 hardware.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been able to build OpenWRT, load it on one unit, and configure it, but I&#039;m running into a strange problem trying to replicate the setup on additional units... after loading the configuration file saved from the original unit (either onto a new unit or the same one), OpenWRT thinks that there are two radios instead of the one physically present in a Bullet, neither one of which works.&nbsp; For example, </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># wifi up
PHY for wifi device radio0 not found
&#039;radio1&#039; is disabled
PHY for wifi device radio0 not found
&#039;radio1&#039; is disabled</code></pre></div><p>I can&#039;t find anything in the configuration file relating to radio1, so I have no idea where that device is coming from.</p>									</div>

					<p>That got things working, thanks!</p><p>So, what is the underlying problem here?<br />1. Configuration backups simply aren&#039;t intended to ever be restored on a different device.<br />2. I did something wrong when setting things up, causing the radio to be referenced by MAC instead of phy #.<br />3. A bug somewhere...</p>									</div>
