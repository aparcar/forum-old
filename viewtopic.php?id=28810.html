					<p>Hi,</p><p>Due to driver related issues, I was having trouble using the wireless on my debian desktop. So I pulled the fonera (atheros chip) out of the closet, and put 10.03 on it. I&#039;m now wondering if I can use fonera as a wireless client, and use the Ethernet port on the fon to connect my desktop. I would like to forward ports from the actiontec through the bridge to the desktop. I read some documentation and it said bridging was only supported by the broadcom chipset. I was wondering if that was still true? Can I have a wireless &lt;--&gt; ethernet bridge? If so, how can I do it?</p><p>|-----------------------|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |-----------------------|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|----------------------|<br />|DSL modem+router |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fonera&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &lt;===== wifi&nbsp; &nbsp;===== &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &lt;=== ethernet ====&gt;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; desktop&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />|&nbsp; actiontec 724&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| <br />__________________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ____________________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ________________</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe there&#039;s more than one solution: <br />1) use WDS<br />2) use routed client mode between fonera and another router and set up a tunnel with TAP device, and bridge it with your eth.</p><p>it really depends on whether you can install openwrt on your master router.<br />I have brcm chipset in my &quot;client&quot; router, but still use #2, because I need multicast routing.</p>									</div>

					<p>a) Run WDS. Both actiontec 724 and fonera should install OpenWrt.<br />or<br />b) Install <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com">Gargoyle</a> (OpenWrt) or DD-WRT (r14896/r15704) on fonera.</p><p>Edit:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#using.masquerade">Routed Client</a> can also do the job.

					<p>hmm, thanks, you gave me a few options to look into. Regarding WDS, reading the manual it seemed like it said that WDS does not work well with different firmwares. The 724 is running actiontec firmware, I don&#039;t think anything else supports the internal DSL modem....</p>									</div>

					<p>option a) has been eliminated. I tried setting up WDS on the fonera, then I went to check if the actiontec GT724WGR supported WDS. From the actiontec website:</p><p>Does Actiontec sell a Wireless Range Expander or Wireless Repeater, to extend a wireless networks coverage?<br />No, Actiontec does not sell a Wireless Repeater. The Wireless Routers, Access Points and Gateways that we currently produce, do not support WDS or Wireless Distribution System. (WDS is a technology that allows the linking of several Wireless Access Points, to create one large Wireless network.)</p>									</div>
