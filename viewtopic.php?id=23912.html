					<p>A cool device, but only has 32MB RAM. For 99€ (plus shipping), I would probably buy something else, i.e. Asus <a href="http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=WAa6AQFncrceRBEo">RT-N16</a> Multi-Functional Gigabit Wireless N router, etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 16 Mar 2010, 18:10)</p>

					<p>Mazilo:&nbsp; Agreed 32MB was, I think, a poor decision, but with 16.7m colour display, keyboard and battery I would say this is overall reasonable value for money.&nbsp; It all depends what hardware you need I guess.</p>									</div>
