The source package will be automatically fetched directly from one of FS GIT repository servers when the package gets compiled the 1st time. Of course, you can manually download FS source from any FS GIT servers, i.e. git clone git://git.freeswitch.org/freeswitch.git. If you just wanna get the mod_gsmopen source, you can do a Google search to find out where to download the gsmlib-1.10 source package.</p><p>AFAICT, mod_gsmopen isn&#039;t compile able out of the box. However, you are welcome to help the development to port this module to OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK, mod_gsmopen isn&#039;t compile able out of the box. It needs some works and I just don&#039;t have time to spare working on this. If anyone out here has managed to port mod_gsmopen to OpenWRT, feel free to chime in.</p>									</div>
