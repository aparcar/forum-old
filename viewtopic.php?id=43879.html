It shares Internet, but I can&#039;t to enter to it. I installed Luci to it and I can&#039;t to enter to it. Any solution? Maybe there is a way how to change settings that wr703 will not be a DHCP server but will be listener?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well for starters, packages will not automagicly install onto that usb drive.<br/>simplest option would be in this case to use extroot, see: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a><br/>and use pivot overlay</p><p>Offline installation is fine, but not the simplest option. because you also have to make sure you have all dependencies downloaded as well. and --nodeps is not a solution.</p><p>What is the reason you don&#039;t have an internet connection on the device? isn&#039;t it a good idea to fix one problem at the time and not thinker with everything at the same time??</p>									</div>
