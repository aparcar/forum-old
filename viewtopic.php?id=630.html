After you have found PATH variable type:<br />export PATH = (original path variable):/buildroot_dir/build_mipsel/staging_dir/bin</p><p>for example:<br />export PATH = /bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/src/buildroot_dir/build_mipsel/staging_dir/bin</p><p>you can test it with &quot;mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc&quot; if command reports &quot;no input files&quot; then it works, if it can&#039;t find command, then your path variable is incorrect.</p><p>Download program sources you want to get compiled and untar them (.tgz packages can be exctracted like this &quot;tar xvfz package.tgz&quot;), read readme or other docs on compilation, most usual way to compile programs is to use first configure-script then make and last, make install, as we are about to move these to wrt, we don&#039;t need to use make install, it would copy files to program directories, but wrt code won&#039;t run on i386 so we couldn&#039;t use them afterall..</p><p>so for the usual case, here&#039;s command line for compilation:<br />CC=mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc LD=mipsel-linux-uclibc-ld ./configure --host=mipsel</p><p>before this u might want to try ./configure --help to see available options, reducing things usually also reduces size of file. Also advanced options like support for ipv6 are disabled as default usually. </p><p>then type make. </p><p>After compilation, if you want to change some settings, command &quot;make clean&quot; this will erase objects, compiled executables and libraries and you can have a fresh start.</p><p>Ofcourse compilation can differ very much of this short example. But usually programs ship with document &quot;INSTALL&quot; or &quot;README&quot; which will guide you on compilation. Also remember that you can&#039;t compile every program. For example, I tryied to compile nmap (on general there&#039;s a thread that contains nmap.tgz) but still haven&#039;t succeeded.</p><p>But this will help everyone to get started.</p>									</div>
