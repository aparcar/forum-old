					<p>Here is my standpoint as a newbie:</p><p>I was to lame to successfully mount the jffs2 partition myself.<br />Also I hadnt known anything about mtd unlock.</p><p>My networking.sh was corrupted somehow, so OpenWRT didn&#039;t come up listening on IP 192.168.1.1.</p><p>I had no clue what to do, so I had to call firstboot which deleted everything on my jffs2 partition <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>If there would have been some script in /usr/sbin where I could mount the jffs2 partition, this hadn&#039;t happend to me.<br />Unnessesary work for nothing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
