					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a widely available, well supported and inexpensive router for use as a core router for home use (around 5 people connected over wireless), with obviously good WiFi capabilities (802.11ac is not necessary, I want it to work well instead of working fast). My intent is to put it behind my ISP modem (put the ISP router in bridged mode).</p><p>Problem is, I need it today or tomorrow, so it really has to be widely available <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ve looked at the ToH which lists all routers that support the current OWRT release, but is that sufficient to identify which router is well supported? How can I seek devices based on how well they are supported?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

I think I could go for around 100 EUR as maximum. This obviously includes prices for used devices.

					<p>Thanks for the recommendations everyone.</p><p>I&#039;ll check out the ebay / craigslist equivalents here and report back. So far in shops I&#039;ve spotted a TL-WR940N and a TL-WR845N, however I&#039;m not at all sure about the hardware versions. As I&#039;ve understood the support for the former is a bit hit-and-miss while the latter doesn&#039;t even have someone who managed to compile OWRT on it yet.

					<p>hmm,&nbsp; I think, we can&#039;t help you googling or buying things. That is a task you have to do on your own. We can tell you which routers are okay, but thats all.
