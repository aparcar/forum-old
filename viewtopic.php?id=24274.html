					<p>Are you using WAN port as a lan interface to access the router? I have a traditional setup with wan connected to ISP using pppoe.<br />And it doesn&#039;t work - with or without reboot, doesn&#039;t matter - everything stops working when port 5 is trunked to vlans.<br />I am using latest Backfire branch.</p>									</div>

Network file is parsed incorrectly, and swconfig misconfigured tagging on ports assignment. I found a workaround to get the vlan tagging properly on assigned ports: <br />In the Network file, configure each vlan sequentially, also the ones you don&#039;t use (very important!). For each VLAN you don&#039;t use, do configure it and only set port assignment to ports &#039;0t 5t&#039; (port 0 is wan/trunk port and port 5 is internal in my case) to it. And configure each VLAN you do want to use accordingly as you like. Here&#039;s an example of my setup where I had to use pvid&#039;s 4 and 7 on specific ports, setting my port 0 (wan) up as a trunk port:</p><p>config &#039;switch&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;name&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;reset&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;enable_vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;3 4 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;3&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;pvid&#039; &#039;4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 1&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;5&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;pvid&#039; &#039;6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;7&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;pvid&#039; &#039;7&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0t 2t 5t&#039;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hvandrie</strong> on 1 May 2010, 17:45)</p>

					<p>I spent tonight attempting to get the switch to put 8021q tagged vlan packets onto various combinations of port 2,3,4.</p><p>With no joy:</p><p>I am running trunk snapshot from 3rd of November. And the swconfig output is showing the correct vlan entry for ports 2,3,4,5&nbsp; - noting that the pvid of port 5 becomes 1001 when this is done. (But I can toggle with the * flag or the switch_ports, pvid directive.</p><p>One thing of note is that I am attempting to set the vlan id to be 1001 , I noticed the enable_vlan4k swconfig setting and toggled it in startup scripts and manually, and the swconfig dev show command now shows all the various vlan container objects upto 4095.</p><p>So basically are tagged vlan&#039;s just complete broken?</p><p>Also note, that wan vlan seems to continue to work (i.e my upstream link works gets dhcp lease).

					<p>yes, I have been able to get vlan tags working with my tp link, the syntax is a little odd, but does work - you need to be sure that vlan0 (the internal cpu bridge/vlan) is always in the vlan group, and the order is important. use swconfig tool to get it right.</p>									</div>
