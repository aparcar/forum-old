					<p>If someone is planning on porting OpenWrt to a new platform/board, what do you suggest be the documentation that they read?&nbsp; The learning curve for this build system seems a little steep at first so being able to point someone to a definitive porting guide for new platform development would be most helpful.&nbsp; Any recommended reading for porting to a new board and developing a new BSP would be most appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>--pk</p>									</div>
