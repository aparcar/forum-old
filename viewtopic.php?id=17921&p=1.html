					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I installed Kamikaze 8.09 RC 1 (openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx) on my WL 500gP (v 1) with an Atheros mini-pci WLAN board (TP-Link TL-WN660g).</p><p>I installed kmod-madwifi and hostapd-mini and set up WLAN as described here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GP">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … us/WL500GP</a> and found that I have bad reception. 5m away from the router I hardly see the network.</p><p>I use psk2 encryption and have the setup working in ap mode.</p><p>I tried out both antenna sockets with each of them I tried the txantenna / rxantenna settings 1 and 2. I checked the other options from <a href="http://sr.uz/index.php?p=223&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">http://sr.uz/index.php?p=223&amp;more=1 … 1&amp;pb=1</a> like turning diversity off explicitely, turning on bursting, setting distance, and increasing txpower. None of this helped.<br />The following is my output from uci show wireless:<br />wireless.wifi0=wifi-device<br />wireless.wifi0.type=atheros<br />wireless.wifi0.disabled=0<br />wireless.wifi0.mode=11bg<br />wireless.wifi0.distance=600<br />wireless.wifi0.channel=3<br />wireless.wifi0.txantenna=1<br />wireless.wifi0.rxantenna=1<br />wireless.cfg03d42f=wifi-iface<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.device=wifi0<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.network=lan<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.mode=ap<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.ssid=network<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.encryption=psk2<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.key=xxxxxxxx<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.txpower=85<br />wireless.cfg03d42f.bursting=1</p><p>Unfortunately I can&#039;t tell if this is an issue of 8.09/RC1 only, since beforehand I had the original ASUS system on the router (also using the broadcom WIFI - there reception was alright).</p><p>Does anybody have suggestions on how to go on here? Is it worth to replace the standard madwifi with the ath5k kmods and retry? Could it be a hardware problem of the mini-pci card?</p><p>Cheers,<br />hol9000</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>I see you have a txpower of &quot;85&quot;. The txpower is given in dBm so 85 is a bit high, maybe madwifi reverts to minimum signal strength if the value is out-of-range. Try to lower the txpower value to something like 15 or 20.</p><p>Edit:<br />Are you sure that the antenna selection is right?</p><p>~ JoW</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jow</strong> on 3 Dec 2008, 15:42)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p><p>In the beginning I started with no explicit txpower-settings, then I increased it to 85, since that value was mentioned somewhere in the forums, then I reduced it to 18 like mentioned in the sz.ru link. Unfortunately none of these settings increased the reception quality.</p><p>Cheers,<br />hol9000</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>Okay, run &quot;athstats&quot; on the shell and look which antenna has the &quot;higher numbers&quot;. Make sure it&#039;s the same as configured in rxantenna, txantenna.<br />For me it looks like this on a Fonera:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Antenna profile:
[1] tx 32414990 rx 62224404
[2] tx   212600 rx      774</code></pre></div><p>So #1 is clearly the primary antenna.</p><p>On my wl500gp for example, the pigtail was too short to be connected to the main antenna plug, so I had it to connect to the &quot;aux&quot; port and change antennas in configuration.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>Compiling fine here with 4.1.2. Did you already try a distclean (remember to backup your old .config), and recompiling with 2.6 as the only change?</p><p>KM</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the feedback. Today a new cable and another antenna arrived, so on the weekend I&#039;ll be able to try out if there&#039;s a hardware problem and if two antennas are a temporary solution to my kind of &quot;forced&quot; antenna diversity setup.</p><p>Cheers,<br />hol9000</p>									</div>
