					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to configure my new linksys router to connect to internet which is provided on a vlan. I have another openwrt router which connect very well, but I was not able to configure this one. I have the following switch configuration:</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.2.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth1 radio0.network1 wlan1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;true&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1.2 wlan1&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;true&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option delegate &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.34&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan4k &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 6t&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;34&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;4t 5t&#039;</p><p>34 is the id of the VLAN i need to connect to. swconfig dev switch0 show shows that even though the cable is connected, the link is still down:</p><p>...<br />Port 4:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mask: 0x0000: (4) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; qmode: 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pvid: 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; link: port:4 link:down<br />Port 5:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mask: 0x0000: (5) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; qmode: 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pvid: 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; link: port:5 link:up speed:1000baseT full-duplex <br />Port 6:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mask: 0x0000: (6) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; qmode: 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pvid: 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; link: port:6 link:up speed:1000baseT full-duplex <br />VLAN 2:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; port_based: 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; vid: 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ports: 0 1 2 3 6t <br />VLAN 34:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; port_based: 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; vid: 34<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ports: 4t 5t </p><p>Can anyone point me to what is going wrong with this configuration?</p>									</div>

					<p>The &#039;swconfig&#039; tools shows the physical status of the link. If it states that port #4&#039;s link is down, it means there&#039;s no physical connection from port #4 to whatever device you are connecting it to.</p><p>Check your cables and the connectors. If your cables and connectors are fine, then you have a configuration issue.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>remme wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Can anyone point me to what is going wrong with this configuration?</p></blockquote></div><p>Your &#039;swconfig&#039; output shows ports 5 and 6 are connected. I&#039;d say you need to change the &#039;4t&#039; to &#039;6t&#039; in VLAN 34 so that the uplink terminates at your router instead of being redirected out of port 4. It seems port 5 maps to the physical &quot;WAN&quot; port on your router from where you want to receive the uplink, and port 6 is the CPU-facing port where you want to lead it to.</p><p>The image at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch</a> will probably give you an insight on what the port numbers mean.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 19 Jul 2017, 11:44)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the answer. I&#039;m pretty sure that port 4 is the &quot;WAN&quot; port. when I connect it to other devices except for my fiber &#039;modem&#039; it says connected. port 5 and 6 are connected to the cpu, being eth0 and eth1. <br />See: the linksys/wrt_ac_series openwrt wiki page.</p><p>Now I think the problem lies in the fact it says the link is down and it doesn&#039;t make a physical connection. With any other device the connection light on my fiber modem is on. With this router it just blinks every two seconds or so.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like that the switch is not compatible with specific other hardware. I found this thread:&nbsp; community.linksys.com/t5/Wireless-Routers/WRT1900AC-VLAN-Problem/td-p/925683. It happens that I also try to connect the router to a Genexis fiber modem and it describes exactly the problem I have.</p><p>Is there anyone else who has trouble connecting this router to certain specific hardware? </p><p>I&#039;m going for the solution to connect an extra managed switch in between the router and modem.</p>									</div>
