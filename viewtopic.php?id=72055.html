					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I have in my hand a TP-Link M7350 and have disassembled the hardware for chipset identification. I have never seen such a beefy nand flash for a pocket router. <strong>Does this look like a good candidate for development?</strong> I will upload the hi resolution pictures of the board later today after work. Eventually I will try and log into the serial console directly from the serial port. Is there any interest in having an LTE portable wifi router update to the MR3040?</p><p>If any developer is interested I can provide the necessary dumps needed.</p><p>ESMT NAND MCP Flash<br />Flash Density = 2GB 1.8V<br />Ram Density = 1GB 400mhz DDR2 SDRAM 1.8V<br />Broadcom = BCM43241ZFKFFBG<br />Qualcomm =&nbsp; MDM9225 1vv<br />4 Pin Serial Port Exposed</p><p>16 Pin unpopulated pads. possible jtag?</p>									</div>
