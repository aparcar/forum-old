					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am running Attitude Adjustment r30849 on my WNDR3800. I have noticed today during 2 file transfers that the LAN port becomes unresponsive during a Windows 7 file copy that goes through the switch. Here is my network configuration:</p><p>Laptop &lt;--1 Gb/s--&gt; WNDR &lt;--100 Mb/s--&gt; Switch &lt;--100 Mb/s--&gt; Switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VOIP adapter&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HTPC, PS3, Xbox</p><p>The transfer is running at 11 MB/s which should not be taxing the WNDR&#039;s Gb switch. Top is reporting a CPU load of 4 - 5% while the transfer is running. I have conntracking on SMB connections disabled.</p><p>I also ran a ping from the laptop to the WNDR:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Pinging 192.168.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:

					<p>So it looks like it might be my AR8131 LAN port causing this. Funny that I didn&#039;t notice this when I was running my laptop wired before, but if I switch to my Intel 5300 wireless I can ping it at ~5ms while transferring files.</p><p>Edit: It was the Atheros drivers. Turning off flow control in the advanced driver settings (Windows 7) fixed it and it now pings at &lt;1ms under load.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ru!ner</strong> on 27 Mar 2012, 07:59)</p>
