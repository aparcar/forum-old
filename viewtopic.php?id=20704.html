					<p>Hello Everyone,</p><p>This is my first post and I am REALLY new to OpenWrt so please bare with me.</p><p>Is there a way to insert a JavaScript code at the end of the website HTML before it makes its way to the browser using OpenWrt? So as the website information is making its way through the OpenWrt router the router inserts a small JavaScript code after it finds the &lt;/body&gt; or at the end of the HTML code. </p><p>I hope this makes sense and thanks in advanced!</p>									</div>
