					<p>I&#039;ve now ordered another transcend, and a proper FTDI 3.3V USB-&gt;serial converter. Maybe when the converter arrives it will turn out that the serial port on the transcend I have is OK, I&#039;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>Another strange thing I have found; the device seems picky about when it will start up. The SD card part always works, but the keyasic sometimes wont start depending on what card reader I am using. What I&#039;ve noticed:</p><p>It starts every time in the USB-&gt;SD adapter that came with it.<br />It starts every time in the SD card reader built in to my laptop.<br />Using an SD-&gt;compact flash converter in a Psion handheld, it sometimes starts but will normally stop part way through the boot.<br />Using an SD-&gt;compact flash converter, and putting this converter in a CF-&gt;USB it starts more often than in the psion, but is still flaky.</p><p>When it refuses to start up, I see part of the bootloader run and then stop, or sometimes the kernel gets part way through booting and then stops.</p><p>I wonder what causes this behaviour... the only thing I can think of is a power issue, that it doesn&#039;t have enough juice when running through an SD-&gt;CF converter. Any thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>&nbsp; I just got myself a flu card, so far I am quite happy about it. I got to play with the autorun.sh, use a busybox with telnetd inside of it and now able to telnet to it.</p><p>the danrause kcard look very good. So if I got this right factory_reset will make the card flash the card with that environment. and if it works, I am very happy.</p><p>The main idea behind this was to download files and make space (delete), sadly unless I hack my camera to mount and unmount the fs, I know it has very little chances to work.</p><p>Another way around it would be to offer the host a virtual vfat fs... well vfat is not that hard to play with and making it nearly infinite with a theoritical max size so big it won&#039;t run out of blocks to allocate, behind the scene find a neat way to prevent writing if the real card is full... Can we offer something else to the host instead of the sd card ?</p><p>Good work guys and thank you !</p>									</div>

					<p>Wierd it should work then my understanding is the sd is just a straight passthrough. If it seems to work for 60 seconds you may look at disabling the sync thes cards do every 60 sec (page 4ish of this thread). </p><p>As far as transfer you can check out<br />http://{ip of device}/uploadto.html</p><p>or write any custom software and load it with aurorun.sh I even got php and ruby running thanks to a webpage in Japanese (thank you google translate lol)</p><p>On a side note if anyone is working on the ravpower filehub and wants to share tips or know of a forum where people are pleas let me know.</p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, perhaps enable FTP the most convenient way. <br />but now I found out that the card does not work through the SPI interface, so my idea with the car radio failed. <br />Only SPI interface implemented in car audio.</p><p>it is very sad, I can not even connect it to the Arduino</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve read in some web pages that the Transcend WIFISD doesn&#039;t work with some configurations because it is SDHC.</p><p>False!</p><p>Almost all the errors with this card are caused by the strictly low powered SD-readers of some devices.</p><p>On the other side if somebody&#039;s device only accepts plain SD-cards(upto 4Gb), then the solution is to make a first 4GB partition on the&nbsp; card&nbsp; and then format it as FAT16.&nbsp; </p><p>It works fine, I&#039;ve tested it, but the remain memory is lost both for Windows as for the Linux embedded, in the first case by stupidity, Microsoft doesn&#039;t allow partitions on SD-cards, and in the second case because it&#039;s necessary in the boot to mount the spare partition, not planned in the firmware...</p>									</div>
