					<p>I switched my Netgear D7800 stock firmware to the official OpenWrt release, Attitude Adjustment 12.09.1, a couple of days ago, but I&#039;m having a few problems:</p><p> - The LEDs don&#039;t seem to work properly.<br /> - Any modification to the wireless networks causes the router to lose 802.11n and 802.11ac support, and can also corrupt the firmware if the channel is set to &quot;auto&quot; when the settings are applied.<br /> - I&#039;m unable to install any packages because there don&#039;t appear to be any:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Downloading //downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09.1/ipq806x/generic/packages/Packages.gz.
wget: server returned error: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Collected errors:
 * opkg_download: Failed to download //downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09.1/ipq806x/generic/packages/Packages.gz, wget returned 1.</code></pre></div><p>(note: I removed the protocols in the urls above for the purposes of posting this)</p><p>Is there a safe way to update to try and overcome these problems?&nbsp; I&#039;m worried about losing VDSL support since this actually appears to be working for me with the OpenWrt firmware released by Netgear.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, thanks for the quick response.&nbsp; Is it possible ADSL is supported but not VDSL?&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case then I may give LEDE a try.</p>									</div>
