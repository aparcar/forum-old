					<p>I recently bought a Linksys WRT 3200ACM router.&nbsp; I have installed OpenWRT on the router and would like to know how I can have one SSID which runs openVPN and have a second SSID on the router which does not run any VPN.&nbsp; I am a subscriber to a VPN service provider already and would like to have some devices in my home access streaming services online without being blocked due to VPN being enabled.&nbsp; These devices are to use the SSID without VPN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>weaponG</strong> on 21 Dec 2016, 17:43)</p>

					<p>Thanks for that post and reply.&nbsp; I am using PIA.&nbsp; The solution sounds like quite a hassle in terms of configuration and troubleshooting.&nbsp; I will just use my old ASUS RT-N66U router as my non-VPN router and connect it directly to the modem.&nbsp; From the ASUS, I will then run an ehternet cable into te Linksys WRT 3200ACM and enable PIA openVPN and make this the VPN router.&nbsp; I hope that this works.&nbsp; It seems a lot easier.</p>									</div>
