					<p>using the openwrt build-environment is really easy and you don&#039;t have to care about crosscompiling difficulties at all. the openwrt build-environment takes care of this. it&#039;s really easy, on you don&#039;t even have to install linux somewhere, you can run a linux-image (I would recommend ubuntu or debian) in a vmware-player.</p><p>to get bcrelay in the pptpd-package you just need to add one line to the pptpd Makefile.

					<p>Is there some kind of noob guide to this build-environment? I was trying to use it before and found it very complicated. All my programing experience is in MS Visual Studio.
