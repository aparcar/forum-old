					<p>Hi,</p><p>I did buy myself a brand new WRT54GL and have now installed OpenWRT. So I might help you out:</p><p>- I used <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Hardware(2f)Linksys(2f)WRT54GL.html">OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL</a> for the most part. Remember save the webpages before you start, in case something breaks and you are offline for a long time! Also download every file BEFORE you start :-)<br />- Start with <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm-2.4/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … uashfs.bin</a> and install it using the Linksys webinterface<br />- Log in via telnet (remember to download putty beforehand)<br />- Enter the nvram-settings described on the install document above.<br />- Reboot<br />- Install <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … uashfs.trx</a>, but grab a hold of <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm47xx/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … uashfs.bin</a> also, just in case. NOTE: Filenames are the same for 2.4 and 2.6, so DO NOT MIX THEM UP!</p><p>At this point, you have a valid OpenWRT installed on your system. Follow the install-document above for configuration.</p><p>So, to some of your question:<br />- I believe that 2.6 has the same features as 2.4. When I read the docs, it seems like this &quot;2.6 does not support this and that&quot; was old.<br />- Setting up forwarding for torrents is not problem. Regarding the 4096 setting on the NAT-table, I can&#039;t help.<br />- The web GUI is good enough. Not to fancy, but gets the job done!<br />- Wifi with WPA2 (PSK) works out of the box. Some docs says you have to install &quot;nas&quot; or &quot;wpa-supplicant&quot;. Not so, if you want to use your Linksys as an AP.<br />- QoS work also, although I have just set my up- and download speeds. I have not done any finetuning, nor do I know how.<br />- Dynamic DNS works, but I have had some problems with zoneedit.com. However, there is a howto on the wiki.</p><p>Good luck!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Sitron_NO</strong> on 30 Apr 2009, 12:02)</p>

					<p>Actually I think nas is important if you use the proprietary broadcom (2.4) driver. With b43 you will need hostapd. wpasupplicant is only if you want to connect with b43 as a client to a wpa network.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is just an inquiry on 2.6 kernel usage and Broadcom 43XX chipset to crack WEP and WPA encryption of wifi networks.</p><p>You know the aircrack team issued a new version aircrack-ng 1.0 rc3 a few weeks ago. I have an intention to run the aircrack-ng application on my wrt54gl to crack some WEP and WPA encryption based wifi networks. The chipset what the wifi router contains is Broadcom BCM5352EKBP, which is exactly the Broadcom 4318-as 802.11 PHY.</p><p>To accomplish packet-injection to the network traffic I have to use additionally the b43 driver. The application needs at least 2.6.26 kernel. The last issued and stable kernel what OpenWrt is suggest is&nbsp; 2.4. What about the Kamikaze series? What would you say if I ask you on the 2.6 kernel based firmware publication? Please suggest me a solution. Every piece of information is well appreciated. Thank you for your effort.</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding QoS, it seems default setup can&#039;t work with PPP interfaces (PPTP actually). At least when I&#039;m looking at the conntrack list (Status -&gt; Conntrack in the X-Wrt), I don&#039;t see any marked connections for the Torrent traffic. I think that&#039;s because iptables chains are binded to the eth0 interface, not ppp0, which is my real WAN connection. But after I added a sed command which replaces every occasion of eth0 to ppp0 in the &#039;/usr/lib/qos/generate.sh all&#039; output, I do see marks appeared. I don&#039;t know yet how to test QoS performance, but it seems nothing get worse at least.</p><p>P.S. I missed some details, I have WRT54GL with OpenWrt 7.09, qos-scripts 1.2.1-1, my ISP interface is eth0.1, which is called &#039;wan&#039;, and real WAN interface ppp0 (default route). I also added some NAT tweaks to have eth0.1 network also accessible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>smokie</strong> on 6 May 2009, 01:30)</p>
