					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have searched the forums but couldn&#039;t find a similar post so I thought I&#039;d throw this question up.</p><p>Has anyone been able to use a Meraki device(atheros chipset) to Connect to a Linksys WRT54G(L) or the other models?</p><p>I have a meraki here that I have flashed with Kamikaze and a Linksys flashed with standard OpenWRT in Adhoc mode for a mesh network im connecting into. I have not been able to connect to any Linksys devices with any atheros wireless device I have, that included the meraki and also my own ITX box with a Atheros wireless PCI card. </p><p>Just wondering if anyone else has had problems connecting the linksys&#039;s to meraki&#039;s or other atheros based devices.</p><p>Cheers<br />Rip</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a meraki connecting to a linksys wrt54g in both normal infrastructure and wds mode, but admittedly i&#039;ve only tried adhoc in passing with atheros (it worked though). if I remember i&#039;ll try later atheros-broadcom adhoc and see what happens</p>									</div>

					<p>Cheers, Thanks for that</p><p>I honestly can&#039;t work out why it wont connect when all my other devices that aren&#039;t atheros based can connect to pretty much anything.</p><p>-Rip</p>									</div>
