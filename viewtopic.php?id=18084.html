					<p>At first my configuration:</p><p>Running both a Sweex LB00021 (self modded USB port) and an Omnima board with Sunspot<br />11 October 2007 (downloaded &amp; tested OK by HI-Dec07) 115200 2400 071011_115_24.zip flashed to the board.</p><p>I use 3 types and sizes (256 MB Sweex, 1 GB DaneElec and 8 GB Intenseo) USB sticks all tried with ext2 and ext 3 filesystem, with the Sunspot stick_070209.tar.gz files on them. Tried both unpacking from the Shell and from the desktop on a PC running Ubuntu .</p><p>After booting the controller with the right files on the USB stick all looks to work well. However, as soon as I download a (cgi or html) file to my computer and modify it and then upload it again I get a message â€œ404 page not foundâ€ . The file does exist, and if I choose to view it with the FTP software it does show up in my local browser. Someway it can not be found by the Sweex or Omnima board by the HTTPD server but it is available for the FTP server. I did set all rights to 777 but no difference.</p><p>Even if I download one of the folders on the var/www to my local PC, delete those files from the folder and upload the same files back to the router they all give the â€œ404 page not foundâ€&nbsp; message but they all do show up in the FTP software and are shown in Explorer and / or Firefox when viewed with the FTP software.</p><p>I did try this with NextFTP and Filezilla on the Windows Vista PC Ã¡nd with Filezilla from the Virtual Machine with Open Suse 11 all with the same result.</p><p>Now, I did fire up the Ubuntu 8.04 PC and unpacked the stick_070208.tar.gz files to the USB stick. All pages do work until I download them (Filezilla) and modify (or donâ€™t modify it) and then upload it again.</p><p>At last I tried to copy a file (which I had created on the Windows PC) with the Ubuntu PC to the USB stick. I tried to copy it to var/www/cgi-bin/led (I want to create my own page with buttons to control GPIO and if that works read out a value of the controlled unit) but than it gives the â€œ404 page not foundâ€ . Then I copied the file to var/www/cgi-bin with the same error. Then I copied the file to var/www where it finally shows up in the browser. Only next problem is that the cgi file (led20on.cgi) is not executed but is selectable to be run or saved on the local computer. Iâ€™m quite sure that this is normal beacuse the cgi file belongs in the cgi-bin folder.</p><p>Now, my question: Am I overlooking something ? Can anyone give me any clue where I go wrong ?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your replies.</p><br /><p>Kind regards,<br />Ben </p><p>( I did start with a search on the forum but I&#039;m not sure which keywords fit my problem...)</p>									</div>
