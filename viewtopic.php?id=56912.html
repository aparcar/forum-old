					<p>Yes, roaming is the correct term.&nbsp; I stand to be corrected, but IIRC it&#039;s not entirely abnormal for the client&#039;s association to remain in the way that you describe.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not reproduced it but wouldn&#039;t expect it to prevent communication between clients.&nbsp; In theory the AP is bridged to the internal switch, which should have an independent L2 forwarding table (anyone else care to comment on that?)</p><p>Which APs are you using, and what software version(s) are you running?</p><p>Also, let&#039;s walk through a scenario:<br /> - Stations A and B are associated with AP1<br /> - Station C is associated with AP2<br /> - Station D has a wired connection to AP1<br /> - Station A roams to AP2</p><p>For the scenario above, can you please test and verify whether Station A can ping/otherwise connect to:<br /> - AP1<br /> - AP2<br /> - Station B<br /> - Station C<br /> - Station D</p><p>Finally, you&#039;re saying that once that stale association expires, things work again?&nbsp; Does the association time out eventually, or do you take action to make it expire?</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting.&nbsp; In adition to knowing whether broadcasts are actually working (given the theory you seem to imply), it would be interesting to know whether directional traffic is flowing in one direction but not another.&nbsp; Are you able to &quot;sniff&quot; on both stations to see if broadcast frames are making it across to check?</p><p>One approach I can think of:<br /> - start up your favourite packet sniffing tool <br /> - flush the ARP cache on both Station A and B after the roam<br /> - initiate a ping from both stations<br /> - watch for ARP and ICMP frames<br /> - verify whether broadcast frames are making it across<br /> - verify whether directional ICMP frames are making it across</p><p>I&#039;m still at a loss to explain why it doesn&#039;t work though; my knowledge of the innards of the wireless kernel module is mostly limited to knowing the names of the drivers I generally use.</p>									</div>

					<p>First, make sure there is only one DHCP server in the network.&nbsp; It is simplest to run it on the lan interface of the router that is routing to the internet.&nbsp; The other router&#039;s configuration is called a &quot;dumb AP&quot; because all it does is pass wifi packets over to the ethernet cable to the main router.&nbsp; Thus your clients should be getting the same IP address (based on their MAC address) even though they roam.</p><p>An AP wifi driver is also a bridge between clients that are connected to it wirelessly.&nbsp; These packets never leave the wifi driver.&nbsp; The default is for this bridge to be on.&nbsp; It can be turned off with the &quot;AP Isolation&quot; setting for situations like a coffee shop where you don&#039;t want the users to be able to reach each other.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that internal bridge is the &quot;problem&quot;.</p><p>As long as a device (basically it&#039;s MAC, I assume) is listed as connected to a certain AP, all the unicast packets that originated from other clients connected to the same AP, targeted to that device, will never leave the internal bridge.<br />So if that device roamed to another AP, but did NOT disassociate from the first one, it cannot communicate with the other devices connected to the first AP.

					<p>Useful thread, thanks - I&#039;ve learnt something significant!&nbsp; I don&#039;t deal much with situations where clients communicate amongst one another so have never noticed this.</p><p>On a practical level to try and resolve your real-world problem: How much overlap is there between your APs?&nbsp; Specifically, in your normal walking route from one AP to the other, at what point(s) is the signal level from both APs the same?&nbsp; There are so many conditions that influence this, but you&#039;d probably want to maintain SNR of &gt;= 10, which could mean anything from -76 dBm to -86 dBm...</p><p>I&#039;d like to understand the probability that the client goes out of range of AP1 before it can see AP2.&nbsp; Maybe the client behaviour will change if there is more overlap?&nbsp; Transmit power on most mobile devices is quite low (typically &lt;16 dBm for 2.4 Ghz) so it&#039;s also possible that the client does attempt to disassociate but the AP never sees it.&nbsp; If lack of overlap is the case, adding a 3rd AP en route could be an option.</p><p>It might also be interesting to see if roaming behaviour changes if you try to use 802.11r, but client support is somewhat limited at present and documentation on how to set it up on OpenWRT is spotty.&nbsp; Some of the major vendors also caution of &quot;unexpected results&quot; when non-802.11r clients associate with an 802.11r network.</p>									</div>

					<p>The APs overlap 100%, that&#039;s the weird part.

					<p>load.runner, did you ever solve your problem? I&#039;m running 4 different ssids (2 APs, 2 2.4ghz radios, each with their own SSID, and 2 5 ghz radios, each with their own SSIDs). I&#039;d really like to just make them all share the same SSID, but I&#039;ll likely run into the same problem you have. I&#039;d love to know if you figured out IAPP or another solution. </p><p>I&#039;d try your ssh script, but I&#039;m using a wrt1900ac right and the devs/wiki recommend using CC RC3. Not sure yet how to insure I&#039;m just getting RC3 when I build, nor am I a openwrt-building pro by any means. Been a year or more since I compiled it myself. I suppose I could check out RC3 from subversion, build, and then compare to the checksum of the downloadable image, but if you found a solution it&#039;d be nice to know.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>While certainly useful functionality, my viewpoint is that this is at best a hack and agree that submitting any of this into trunk would be premature at best; even then, any attempts to submit this would likely be countered with an argument that - though deprecated - IAPP (as suggested by duvi) already does this.</p><p>I&#039;d anticipate that for most people, using a &quot;repeater&quot;-style implementation would be a much simpler solution to the problem as it would keep the MAC on the wireless side.&nbsp; With multi-stream being common in consumer routers today, the reduced throughput would likely be acceptable in most cases.</p><p>Those of us desperate, stubborn or stupid enough to make it work the &quot;right&quot; way can continue to hack away in the spirit of OSS :-)</p>									</div>
