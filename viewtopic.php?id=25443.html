					<p>I&#039;ve got 3 routers running openwrt; I just upgraded them all to backfire. One is used as the actual router, with a lot of services enabled (nat, dns, dhcp, etc). The other two are configured as bridges, so I can use them as wireless APs without additional NAT.</p><p>Previously I was running a recent trunk build on the master router, and whiterussian on the bridges. That worked fine, but I wanted to get everything on the same build, so I brought them all forward to backfire.</p><p>Now using backfire, the two bridges are not sending any hostname or client ID in their DHCP requests. The result is that the master router&#039;s dnsmasq doesn&#039;t have names to assign to them, and if I want to address the bridges (ssh into them to reconfigure wifi, for example), I have to look up their IP addresses by MAC address in the master&#039;s /tmp/dhcp.leases. This is exactly the problem that dnsmasq solved in my life years ago -- automatic DNS hostnames for everyone who&#039;s requested a DHCP address. So I&#039;m pretty annoyed to have to resort to writing down IP adresses for my internal boxes again.</p><p>The way I configured the two bridge boxes as bridges was to edit /etc/config/network, and:<br />- set the lan interface&#039;s proto to dhcp, instead of static<br />- set the wan interface&#039;s proto to none, instead of dhcp (not sure if this does anything)<br />- move switch port 0 from vlan 1 (wan) to vlan 0 (lan), so I can use all 5 switch ports</p><p>All is working fine except the DHCP client ID -- the master router&#039;s dhcp.leases file shows &quot;*&quot; where I&#039;d expect a hostname for the bridges, and I&#039;ve confirmed via tcpdump that the DHCP requests coming from the bridges have no hostname or client ID field set.</p><p>I looked at udhcpc docs, and it&#039;s got command line options for setting both hostname and client ID. It doesn&#039;t say what it uses by default. I&#039;d assume it uses the real hostname, but maybe it doesn&#039;t know how on openwrt ($HOST is not set in environment, hostname command doesn&#039;t exist, you can grab it out of /proc/sys/kernel/hostname; ash knows it but maybe udhcpc doesn&#039;t).</p><p>I can&#039;t figure out where udhcpc is started from, though. I see one call in /etc/init.d/dnsmasq, but that seems like a weird place for it, and the arguments are completely different to those passed to the udhcpc instance that remains running on my box.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if this problem (udhcpc doesn&#039;t have a hostname to pass as part of its DHCP client request0 is peculiar to my bridge-only setup, or if it always does that -- I suspect most people running openwrt aren&#039;t in a position to know or care what it uses in its DHCP client request since normally the only DHCP client request it makes is on the wan. So maybe it always does this.</p><p>Anyone know:<br />- where udhcpc is invoked from?<br />- why it wouldn&#039;t know the hostname by default, and whether the right thing is to add something like -H `cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname` to its command line, or set HOST in the environment, or something else?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi I am new to OpenWrt and found this old thread which is related to my situation. But I didn&#039;t understand suggestion in previous posts. Anybody can help me&nbsp; understand&nbsp; (&quot;Option hostname&quot; in the interface config file) where is this file and what is the exact parameters I can put in the file. </p><p>I have one OpenWrt router ( Wrt54GL ) in my network and I cannot ping it with its hostname . I can ping through its IP address which is assigned by main router. I cannot even do nslookup.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cyber4tech</strong> on 27 Jul 2012, 02:04)</p>

					<p>Hi,<br />In /etc/config/network, under the interface config options of the interface you are trying to configure you should write option &#039;hostname&#039; &#039;the-name-you-want&#039;. <br />For example, I have an interface called &#039;lan&#039; so in /etc/config/network I have something like:</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option hostname&nbsp; &#039;MR3020&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;dhcp&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply. I did it and DHCP lease table of main router I can see hostname for my OpenWrt Router. But still I cannot ping with Hostname neither nslookup works.

					<p>I think I finally solved this, lots of trials but I think my final change was the only one required and that was to add my MAC address to the field for &quot;Client ID to send when requesting DHCP&quot; under advanced settings.</p>									</div>
