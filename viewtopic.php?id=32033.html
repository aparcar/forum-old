					<p>I just stumbled over this article:&nbsp; <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/456762/">http://lwn.net/Articles/456762/</a> from August, 2011</p><p>The dispute is unnecessary, but more GPL&#039;ed code, definitely leads to a more diverse hardware for us to choose from. It&#039;ll just take a while longer, because code has to be merged. Into the one or the other driver.</p><p>&nbsp; * Question is, how much longer? And what about the ADSL-hardware that many broadcom SoC additionally contain?<br />&nbsp; * Since Atheros was swallowed by Qualcomm and AFAIK Qualcomm produces xDSL-hardware as well, it remains to be seen what they are going to offer.</p><p>I am still looking for a router with VDSL2-modem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks! That was a great article and followup!</p><p>And IMHO I really don&#039;t think this will impact or make a difference to SoC support. Unlikely there will be any. If BCM is that tight, even with simple hardware specifications, it is very unlikely we&#039;ll see anything interesting coming out of this.</p>									</div>
