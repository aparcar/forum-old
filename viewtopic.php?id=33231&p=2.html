					<p>A silly question that may not belong here, but I&#039;d appreciate some pointers.&nbsp; I would just like to have a basic wireless AP setup. I did this:<br />- flashed the openwrt .bin file on my DIR-601 router<br />- installed luci via the command line (ie. my router was connected to the internet to download packages)<br />- added a wireless network, choosing &#039;lan&#039; as the attached network</p><p>Connecting from the wireless clients, I can&#039;t connect to the internet, though my router can via ssh. I&#039;m probably missing some basic config to route traffic between the wan and the lan, but not sure what that is. If anyone can help point me in the right direction, I&#039;d appreciate it!</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a little journey with this router and this thread was incredibly helpful, so I want to give something back.&nbsp; I purchased a D-Link Refurbished DIR-601/RE from Amazon for $12.99 (with Prime) with the intent to use it in client mode.&nbsp; It is this router, with the B1 hardware version.&nbsp; I looked for a dd-wrt image to use, but didn&#039;t find one.&nbsp; I did thankfully get pointed here.&nbsp; </p><p>Long story short, most of the links to images were broken by the time I got here.&nbsp; The only one that worked was the very first one from jay0lee, and that build didn&#039;t have luci and was a little low on space to work with.&nbsp; I bit the bullet and built my own image from source.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually not too bad.&nbsp; As jay0lee says, credit to the OpenWRT devs.&nbsp; </p><p>Here&#039;s a link for my builds that hopefully keeps working: <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_DZbst53g8DOGRZTUFHOHBTZFU&amp;usp=sharing.">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id= … p=sharing.</a>&nbsp; The folder includes all three images that my build spit out.&nbsp; Not sure what the exact difference between the normal and the -NA image is, but you can try them both.&nbsp; I used the sysupgrade image&nbsp; because I already had jay0lee&#039;s build installed.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried the other two, but please do and let me know what happens.&nbsp; </p><p>I cut as much as I could out of the build to keep the size down.&nbsp; The only thing that might matter to someone is that I cut PPP (and thus PPPoE).&nbsp; I built with the micro c-lib rather than the standard one, and I think that makes opkg unhappy when trying to install things.&nbsp; Hopefully the build has everything you need though.</p><p>After installing, I tried the various methods to setup something like client mode.&nbsp; This is the one that worked for me: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient.</a>&nbsp; The build does include relayd.</p><p>Thanks everyone who has contributed to this thread.&nbsp; Hopefully this helps some wayward internet soul.</p>									</div>
