					<p>Hi,<br />I got a WZR-HP-G300NH running OpenWrt, converted from DD-Wrt as described in the wiki. The WZR is connected to a DOCSIS modem, and gets its IP per dhcp. Connected to the router are two machines (a PC and a Samsung Media Server), and a switch, where two additional PCs are plugged in.</p><p>Now most times everything just runs fine and fast, the router never gets big system load; but at some times the network is incredibly slow. The switch shows, that the router is constantly sending some packets, but they do not seem to be correctly adressed. On the switch, only the LED from the router&#039;s port blinks, but no other LED; so my guess is that some program running on the router sends malformed packets. Currently running services are hotplug2, dropbear, uhttpd, udhcpc, hostapd and dnsmasq. QoS is deactivated.</p><p>My question is, how do i find out what floods the network? My only idea was wireshark, but as the switch doesn&#039;t forward the malformed packets, it would have to run on the router himself; and i cannot find any wireshark-package for opkg…</p><p>//edit: I use backfire 10.03.1-rc4, the build specified here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h</a></p>									</div>

					<p>You need &quot;tcpdump&quot;, google some more about it, especially about &quot;remote tcpdump&quot;. With some fifo tricks and ssh you can capture the datastream with tcpdump on the router and display it locally in wireshark.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, i found this script: <a href="http://bashscripts.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=722">http://bashscripts.org/forum/viewtopic. … &amp;t=722</a><br />I installed tcpdump on the box, and I can launch it manually from ssh, but not per script: ash tells me that the command was not found…</p><p>Another interesting thing: since the Windows 7 PC connected to the switch was shut down, the floodings stopped. Maybe there&#039;s a malfunction or a bot on the Windows PC that convinces the router sending useless packets…<br />I turned off Upnp-support and checked &quot;Filter useless&quot; in the dnsmmasq-settings. Tomorrow I will see if that hepls…</p>									</div>

					<p>The reason it&#039;s probably not running from your script is that tcpdump is not in the PATH variable.</p><p>Try putting this at the top of your script below #!/bin/ash</p><p>PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the hint, it works now.</p><p>Interesting, since i turned off upnp no flooding occured again…<br />When I get the chance, I will turn it on again and then capture the data, but atm I cannot allow network slowdown.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry that i have to dig out this thread again, but my problem showed up again. This time even with only one Linux PC connected to the switch, so neither Teredo nor a Windows-Virus might have been the cause of my problem.</p><p>I also managed to capture some packets with tcpdump before the connection broke, but I did not find any suspicious packets. But if someone could tell me what i should look for…</p><p>Maybe I should also mention that the Connection from router to switch does not exactly fulfill the Standards (long, high resistance, possible packet loss), but since it worked with the old router (DI-256), I do not think it is a hardware-problem.</p>									</div>
