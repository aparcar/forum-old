					<p>i havent used a jtag for the wrtsl54gs(yet) but i did have exactly the same problem when i was flashing a new cfe to my wrt54g v5 it turned out to be a totally n00b&#039;ed up cable, i guess i was tired when i made the cable, when i checked the pinouts it turned out to be bass ackward after i fixed it, the utility detected the board/flash and worked fine</p>									</div>

					<p>You were so right....totally nOObed the cable like you said,&nbsp; oh well it was like 3 am when I did it, that&#039;s my excuse anyway.&nbsp; I also ripped off one of the tiny JTAG pads after hours of soldering and resoldering so it&#039;s really dead now. So I bought a new one from Best Buy ;-)&nbsp; </p><p>I also found a WRT54GS v.4 at WalMart last night .&nbsp; Now I have something with a JTAG header that I can practice OpenWRT without fear of Bricking like I did my SL.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks for the help ,&nbsp; Good luck to anyone else trying to JTAG the WRTSL54GS, it&#039;s very possible but those pads do lift easily ;-)&nbsp; </p><p>--Duane</p>									</div>

					<p>Well the trick to those pads is to use a really small stranded wire (like a cut up IDE40 cable), prestrip and presolder the ends, and then just touch the the wire to the pad and touch the iron to the wire.&nbsp; That&#039;s all you need.</p><p>Use a low-heat iron; mine (at home) is an $8 25w iron (the one at work is a $200 temp controlled beauty...)</p><p>--Yan</p>									</div>
