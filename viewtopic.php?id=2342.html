					<p>Hi guys (gals?)</p><p>I am successfully running Asterisk using the WhiteRussian version.<br />When I use any telephone registered INSIDE my network (on a 192.168... ip) I have no problems with audio.</p><p>but</p><p>When I use a telephone registered to Asterisk from OUTSIDE my network (say.. from work) then the registration works fine (I had to open the 8050 ports on openwrt to udp and tcp) BUT THERE IS NO AUDIO (Everything else works fine though.. including telephoning my telephone at home... or using the dialplans in extensions.conf to call outside lines).</p><p>I want to know what I have to tell openwrt so that my audio works with Asterisk with connections coming from the internet.</p><p>thanx for any help you might lend me!<br />/SHAWN</p><p>p.s. I really don&#039;t think this is a problem on the client side of my sip connection. I believe this because if I configure my client (Xlite) to register to a service OTHER than my asterisk server on openwrt then the audio works fine.</p><p>p.p.s. My client is in a DMZ.</p><p>p.p.p.s. when I remove the S45filewall file from etc/init.d and reboot, this doesn&#039;t help matters at all.</p><p>p.p.p.p.s. I&#039;m thinking that maybe RTP packets aren&#039;t getting through (whatever THAT means!).</p><br /><p> h e l p !</p>									</div>
