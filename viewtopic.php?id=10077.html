					<p>I&#039;m attempting a VPN client setup that&nbsp; requires a newer version of<br />Openswan than is packaged for OpenWrt 0.9.&nbsp; Want to connect<br />a WRT54GS v2.1 as a VPN client to a Cisco firewall using XAUTH.<br />Works ok with Cisco VPN Client on the Windows box, but would<br />prefer to have Linky handle the tunnel.</p><p>Is there any chance that this can be done for either White Russian or<br />Kamikaze in the relatively near future?</p><p>I&#039;ve appended the relevant changelog entries, per Paul Wouters<br />in the Openswan dev mailing list.&nbsp; Also his final comments from<br />our exchange on the Openswan developer mailing list.</p><p>BTW White Russian is astoundingly excellent.&nbsp; Impressive quality<br />and packaging.&nbsp; Love the mini_fo overlay of jffs2 on top of the<br />squashfs.&nbsp; Can barely tell the difference between ipkg and yum.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>David</p><p>v2.4.8<br />* Fix for Aggressive Mode and NAT-T port floating, based on RedHat patch [paul]<br />* Fix for Aggressive Mode and NAT-T (#491) by Delta Yeh<br />* bugtracker bugs fixed:<br />&nbsp; #git c2e23a6e16a55632d618740518d419f3fad3323d: AggressiveMode with nhelpers=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fix from Marin Hincks</p><p>v2.4.7<br />* bugtracker bugs fixed:<br />&nbsp; #474 ASSERTION FAILED at spdb_struct.c:1233: trans-&gt;attr_cnt &gt; == 4&quot;</p><br /><br /><p>Date: Tue, 27 Mar 2007 07:59:40 +0200 (CEST)<br />From: Paul Wouters &lt;paul@xelerance.com&gt;<br />To: David Lawless &lt;lawless@spamcop.net&gt;<br />cc: users@openswan.org, dev@openswan.org<br />Subject: Re: [Openswan dev] trying to configure XAUTH as&nbsp; replacement for working Cisco VPN Client</p><p>On Mon, 26 Mar 2007, David Lawless wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thank you for your reply.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Have no control over the Cisco server side, so can&#039;t<br />&gt; switch to L2TP.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; It seems probable I want to be the xauth client.&nbsp; Would<br />&gt; it help to attempt to be the server?&nbsp; The other end is<br />&gt; a hardware Cisco VPN firewall.</p><p>Ohh. I completely misunderstaood you. I thought you were trying to<br />connect a laptop to your home router.</p><p>&gt; I can look into building the latest Openswan version for OpenWrt<br />&gt; on a MIPS CPU, but it could be a lot of work.&nbsp; Perhaps could<br />&gt; convince the OpenWrt developers to try it or pull a release from<br />&gt; their current development build.&nbsp; Is this the best approach?</p><p>That would be best. The only pending issues for openswan 2.4.8, why<br />it is still rc1, has to do with 2.6.19+ kernels, while openwrt for<br />the linksys at least, uses a 2.4 kernel.</p><p>If you are convincing them of things, have them switch from l2tpd 0.69<br />to xl2tpd 1.1.09 would also be a good thing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Paul</p>									</div>
