					<p>Hello guys.<br />Please help me.<br />I installed OpenWrt to my WR841ND 8.1 and than soldered a serial port with XBee.</p><p>I planned to read serial port with python-mini and pyserial, but I have only 940kb free space after clean install of OpenWrt.<br />Python-mini requires 1.2 mb.</p><p>What can I do? <br />Maybe there is a better way to continiously read serial port or I can clean some space for python?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Build you own image, include everything you need, and remove everything you don&#039;t need. <br />you probably don&#039;t need ppp and pppoe (+kernel modules), if you don&#039;t use it as router you won&#039;t need firewall, iptable, etc. and if you include everthing in the image you don&#039;t need opkg either. <br />But maybe you can use something elso to read the serial which doesn&#039;t need a big package like python.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 4 Mar 2013, 23:37)</p>

					<p>eleon216 thanks.<br />Building the custom image will be the last step. It&#039;s a little scarying me, because I can brick to router.<br />Can you suggest some other solutions to read byte arrays from com port and store them in a file?</p>									</div>

					<p>you can always recover the router with a working serial console by using tftp do flash a new image. So don&#039;t be afraid, everthing will be ok <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>But if you don&#039;t want to go this road, I guess you could write a small C-programm to read data from serial, probably with way less (additional) dependencies/overhead <a href="http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html">http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 5 Mar 2013, 16:13)</p>
