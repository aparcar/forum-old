					<p>Hi, I want to install OpenWRT on my Wyse Winterm. Curently I&#039;ve installed to a harddisk but I really would like to replace the HD by a small flashcard again. These (surplus) Winterms come with 256 MB Ram an a 256 Mb Flash card with WinXP embedded in IDE0. Do I need another image than x86 to prevent frequent writes to the flash? Or does OpenWRT run from Ram anyway? The documentation I found does not say anything about this. For WRT54 devices it is clear; they don&#039;t have any disks but when I do a &#039;df&#039; I dee an &#039;sda1&#039; and &#039;sda2 swao&#039; device which makes me wonder.</p><p>Tnx for some light here...</p><p>Egbert Jan</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. Not really an answer to my question. Maybe I was not very clear. Installing with &#039;dd&#039; is no problem. I use a live-CD for that. What I want to know is if there are images in the /x86 tree that are made for flash. The ext2 image clearly wrties to hardsisk and that is something you want to prevent when using flash storage. I must say that I&#039;m rather disappointed by the lack of documentation and phylosophy behind OpenWRT. It is all geared towards wrt54 boxes.<br />Egbert jan</p>									</div>

					<p>kshbu0: for OpenWrt it does not matter on which media it runs, x86 uses the same codebase as the builds for wrt54gl and others. There are virtually zero writes to flash/harddisk etc. when the system runs. Stuff like pid files are stored in /tmp which is a ramdisk and the systemlog is a ring buffer in ram. Writes only occur if you edit config files or change stuff in the web interface.</p><p>Also use squashfs images on your CF card, ext2 is not really suitable as flash filesystem and it is easily damaged by sudden powerloss and such.</p>									</div>

					<p>Tnx Jow. Good to hear that virtuallay nothing is wryitten to &#039;disk&#039;. Is the functionality the same of those small squashfs the same as the 50Mb ext2 image or are &#039;things&#039; left out, like webinterface? I need to add a few packacges for IPv6 (iptables6, radvd, wide-dhcp6-client). I have 256 Mb flashcards (with IDE connector). Will the image allow usage of the extra space or is all outside the images waisted?</p><p>Egbert Jan</p>									</div>

					<p>The squashfs iamges contain the same packages as the ext2 ones. On first boot, the remaining free space after the squashfs partition is formatted as jffs and mounted as writeable overlay.</p>									</div>
