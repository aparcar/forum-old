					<p>We don&#039;t want to split the community, we are looking to create useful additions to openwrt, right now the biggest being the extended webif we are working on. Things from time to time, may be added back into the openwrt tree ( at the discretion of the openwrt devs ). Our main goal is to make it possible for those that may use a less stable/functional firmware than openwrt just because said firmware has a webgui to configure most things, the ability to use/setup openwrt. It is better said here <a href="http://www.bitsum.com/xwrt.asp">http://www.bitsum.com/xwrt.asp</a></p>									</div>

					<p><strong>Project news:</strong></p><p>Webif^2 will <strong>not</strong> be included in White Russian RC6. We aren&#039;t nearly done with the webif and the polishing necessary for a proper release. Since Openwrt wants to get RC6 out quickly there is no time to wait for us and/or test the changes. Also, there hasn&#039;t been any attempt to update the translations of webif^2 as of yet (it would be crazy to do that now, since things are changing so much on a daily basis). </p><p>We actually welcome this news as it allows us to develop with more freedom than ever before.</p><p><strong>Help Wanted:</strong></p><p>As always, we need more contributors. We specifically need the following:</p><p>&nbsp; * Developers<br />&nbsp; * Artists (for CSS themes)<br />&nbsp; * Testers<br />&nbsp; * Documentation/Wiki writers<br />&nbsp; * Proliferators (spread the word)<br />&nbsp; * Managers (I&#039;m sure no manager)<br />&nbsp; * Translators</p><p>If you want to see this project succeed, it&#039;s up to YOU to help out. Complacency is one of the reasons a good webif doesn&#039;t already exist for OpenWrt. If you don&#039;t do it, nobody else will. It&#039;s EASY to get involved with the X-Wrt project, we aren&#039;t selective and don&#039;t make you jump through hoops just to get write acces to our repository. We figure no permanent damage can be done, so we&#039;ll grant access to virtually anyone until they prove themselves uncapable of handling the responsibility.</p><p><strong>Development news:</strong></p><p>As always, much has changed in the last couple days. The &#039;update check&#039; is working properly now, and I&#039;ve also added an &#039;upgrade/reinstall&#039; button to the Information / About page. So, keep an eye on updates to the webif, as using yesterday&#039;s build is a dis-service to yourself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>This weeks additions are numerous, so I won&#039;t try to mention them all. However, for end users the install process is easier than ever, they simply need to type in the IP address of their router into the form&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bitsum.com/xwrt.asp">here</a>.</p><p>I got around to writing up the javascript for the color theme switching, so now people are no longer stuck with brown. I still have much work to do on the color themes themselves, but currently blue, navy blue, green, white, and brown are availble. For a sample, I&#039;ve attached a pic of the themes as they are now. </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.bitsum.com/images/blue.png" alt="http://www.bitsum.com/images/blue.png" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.bitsum.com/images/green.png" alt="http://www.bitsum.com/images/green.png" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.bitsum.com/images/white.png" alt="http://www.bitsum.com/images/white.png" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.bitsum.com/images/navyblue.png" alt="http://www.bitsum.com/images/navyblue.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>db90h</strong> on 10 Oct 2006, 10:53)</p>

					<p>In the last day I&#039;ve went through and fixed known remaining bugs, made a number of minor improvements and adjustments, and have started going through the pages and validating them as valid XHTML. Pages that I&#039;ve validated show the W3C Valid logo. There are many more left to go through, but most all are close to validation, just need a few typos and other errors cleaned up.</p><p>I&#039;ve done this work in preparation for Milestone 1, a beta interim release.

					<p>This looks cool but the text color in logread_frame.sh is black...so no text is showing up unless you select the text.</p><p>It&#039;s only possible to change the color scheme from the main page (webif.sh). When clicking on a color scheme on any other page, the link is active but the color scheme doesn&#039;t change.</p><p>I think that current system time should be shown either in info or status.</p><p>Cheers and keep the good work</p><p>PS - Btw, if translation to portuguese is required I could do it</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mtsales</strong> on 14 Oct 2006, 11:42)</p>
