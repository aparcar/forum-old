					<p>So I tried installing openwrt because the it&#039;s the only way i&#039;ve found online to monitor my bandwidth usage. I&#039;m on a tplink wdr3500. I got it installed and i&#039;m in whatever this interface is but I don&#039;t have any internet anymore. Nothing will connect and I can&#039;t figure out what to do. I&#039;ve spend the last 4 hours trying to figure out how to go back and I don&#039;t know what the fuck to do. I&#039;m going to have a fucking aneurysm or some shit because I&#039;m so frustrated. I just bought this router and I just want it to work again. Please help me i&#039;m begging you guys.</p>									</div>
