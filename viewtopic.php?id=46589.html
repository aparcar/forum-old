					<p>Hello,</p><p>I did a sysupgrade to newest trunk and have a weird problem now. Not all of my commands in my rc.local are executed anymore at boot time, it worked perfetly fine for years, after every sysupgrades before. Heres my rc.local:</p><p>#ip rules<br />ip rule add fwmark 1 table main<br />ip rule add fwmark 2 table vpn1<br />ip rule add fwmark 3 table vpn2<br />ip rule add fwmark 4 table vpn3<br />ip rule add from 192.168.1.12 table vpn1<br />#ip rule add from 192.168.1.11 table vpn3</p><p>ip route add default via 192.168.1.2 dev br-lan table vpn3</p><p>#vpn<br />/usr/sbin/screen -d -m /usr/sbin/openvpn --config ....ovpn --route-nopull --dev tun0<br />/usr/sbin/screen -d -m /usr/sbin/openvpn --config ....ovpn --route-nopull --dev tun1</p><p>/root/drop.sh</p><p>exit 0</p><p>The two screen commands arent executed anymore. If I type them in manually after boot they work fine. I dont see anything on logread too. Any ideas whats going on?</p><p>--</p><p>Okay put the screen sessions in zombie mode and the problem is this:</p><p>5.255.248.0 init Another app is currently holding the xtables lock. Perhaps you want to use the -w option?</p><p>Seems there was something changed since last trunk causing this. What does this mean and how to get it working again?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 3 Oct 2013, 06:58)</p>

					<p>It seems there was something changed with iptables, if you google &quot;Perhaps you want to use the -w option&quot; there are some findings about it in the code changelogs. I guess it worked before because these changes werent in the trunk at that time, which changed. I added &quot;-w&quot; to my iptables scripts and it seems to work now. I had up and down scripts for each openvpn connection like this:</p><p>up.sh<br />#!/bin/ash<br />IFACE=&#039;tun0&#039;<br />VPN=&#039;vpn1&#039;<br />GEO=&#039;de2&#039;</p><p>IP=$(ip -4 address show $IFACE | grep &#039;inet&#039; | sed &#039;s/.*inet \([0-9\.]\+\).*/\1/&#039;)<br />GW=${IP%.*}.1</p><p>echo $IP &gt; /etc/openvpn/ip/$GEO.log</p><p>ip route add default via $GW dev $IFACE table $VPN<br />iptables -w -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $IFACE -j SNAT --to $IP</p><p>down.sh<br />#!/bin/ash<br />IFACE=&#039;tun0&#039;<br />GEO=&#039;de1&#039;</p><p>IP=$(cat /etc/openvpn/ip/$GEO.log)<br />GW=${IP%.*}.1</p><p>ip route del $GW<br />iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o $IFACE -j SNAT --to $IP</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 4 Oct 2013, 00:43)</p>
