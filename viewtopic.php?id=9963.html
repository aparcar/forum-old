					<p>A good place to start is to google for lsmod, insmod rmmod. You might also want to check out lsusb.&nbsp; Also, I think you need to use the 2.6 flavor of linux to get the sound to work, although I might be wrong on that.&nbsp; Nevertheless, modules in linux 2.4 and 2.6 are not compatible with each other.&nbsp; I struggled with that at first trying to get it to work, trying to load modules that were compiled for 2.4 into a 2.6 kernel.&nbsp; That did not work. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Search the forum for my username, there are several posts about getting sound to work.&nbsp; This one has a lot of random info in it. </p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8138">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8138</a></p><p>Having no experience with openwrt or compiling kernels or working with modules, it took me about a month to figure it out, spending free time here and there.&nbsp; I even had to learn how to solder to make the stinking serial cable. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Ultimately, what I discovered is that even though I was compiling the sound support, the module files, *.ko, were not getting transferred to my wgt634u.&nbsp; I had to throw them into my ipkg directory i was using internally and &quot;wget&quot; them to my /lib/module/2.6.x/ folder.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember where they live in the build tree, i think build_mipsel/../../../etc/.&nbsp; I&#039;m also unsure as to why they didn&#039;t make the cut in the firmware image.&nbsp; Ahh well though.&nbsp; After all that, i just used insmod to install them. If you have the luxury of having a serial cable, it will help as well b/c the kernel will print error messages about missing module dependencies.&nbsp; There is a certain order that those sound modules need to be installed in.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t mind waiting a day or so, I can post step by step instructions, less the details of compiling to get you up and running.&nbsp; I&#039;m making my third wgt634u music jukebox, they work great, especially if you get one with optical outs on the usb stick + mpd + mpc/qmpdclient.</p><br /><p>*qmpdclient is a QT implementation that takes the place of mpc on your desktop.&nbsp; It works in linux, windows and mac OSx - universal binary.&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://havtknut.tihlde.org/qmpdclient/download.php">http://havtknut.tihlde.org/qmpdclient/download.php</a></p>									</div>

					<p>That would be great!!! I am using the 2.6 flavor, I will post the .config file at the bottom of this reply. I have poked arount the forum and have not found the key as of yet. The fact that the ko files are not getting over sound interesteing. </p><p>I do have a serial cable, Purchase a brainstem from <a href="http://www.acroname.com/robotics/parts/S13-SERIAL-INT-CONN.html">http://www.acroname.com/robotics/parts/ … -CONN.html</a>, I do not have anything to do with the manufacture, but the product does work good and is very cheap and small.</p><p>My goal here is to do two things, Play audio files from a USB stick and play audio files from a remote files system (NFS or samba).</p><p>I have the USB memory stick(s) working great.</p><p> </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#

					<p>Ok, not quite working yet. There is a small difference I found between the build I did for the WGT and another for Atheros-2.6 - which had the oss.ko&#039;s. Also an earlier version I had of the WGT&#039;s build (with kmod-alsa and all that stuff) also had these 2 oss.ok&#039;s: [snd-mixer-oss.ko and snd-pcm-oss.ko].</p><p>Anyway this got me 1/2 way there. First I scp&#039;d the snd* files to root&#039;s /lib/modules/2.6.19.2 folder. Insmod&#039;d fine in this order:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/lib/modules/2.6.19.2# insmod snd

root@OpenWrt:/lib/modules/2.6.19.2# insmod snd-usb-lib
root@OpenWrt:/lib/modules/2.6.19.2# insmod snd-usb-audio

then it gave me this, which looked promising
usbcore: registered new interface driver snd-usb-audio

this also looked ok:

root@OpenWrt:/mnt/packages# lsmod | grep snd

------------------------------
Getting started
------------------------------
You need:
 * a serial cable with the correct voltage so you don&#039;t fry your board
 * a tftp server
 * a web server
 * some wit/common sense
 * willingness to make something that works fine before you start with it
   and turn it into something that simply takes up space on your desk. 
   EG, you may break your router doing this. Be warned.
 * common sense to replace local addresses with ones that apply to your setup.
 * assumes you already built your kamikaze firmware with the settings and software that you want.

1. open hyperterminal and plug your serial cable to the serial port on router. (make sure it&#039;s the correct voltage! you need a special serial cable)
   You must take the cover off, look for four pins.
2. plug your serial cable and connect to it via your com port in hyperterminal/some terminal program.
3. hold down ctrl-c until you see the CFE&gt; prompt.

Type/paste:

  ifconfig eth0 -addr=192.168.0.101 -mask=255.255.255.0

Replace 192.168.0.101 with desired IP address.  This will be the IP of the wgt634u.

Then:

  flash -noheader 192.168.0.103:openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin flash0.os

192.168.0.103 is the IP address of your TFTP server.  I&#039;ve found that it&#039;s easiest to just place the bin file 
in the TFTP root directory, where it looks to serve/accept files.

You should see this....or something like it:
CFE&gt; flash -noheader 192.168.0.103:openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin flash0.os
Reading 192.168.0.103:openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin: Done. 2084864 bytes read

Programming...done. 2084864 bytes written
*** command status = 0
CFE&gt;

Now, type reboot and watch it powerup, watching the console.

------------------------------
Configure ipkg
------------------------------

edit /etc/ipkg.conf.  Point it to your bin/package directory in your build path.
For me, this is /home/joe/trunk/bin/package.  I then symlink this to my apache root so that ipkg
can see it and download them.  Oh yeah, you&#039;ll need apache too.

My ipkg.conf looks like:

#begin ipkg.conf ----------------------
src joe http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/   #&lt;---openwrt/packages is a symlink 
                                 # to my build path mentioned above
dest root /
dest ram /tmp
#end ipkg.conf   ----------------------

After you set your ipkg to the right machine

type:

 ipkg update
 ipkg install kmod-madwifi
 ipkg install wpa-supplicant
 ipkg install wpa-cli
 ipkg install wireless-tools
 ipkg install kmod-fs-cifs
 ipkg install cifsmount

You may need to install some other kmod-fs-* filesystems.  You can see other packages by doing something like this:

 ipkg list |grep -i kmod

type:

 lsmod

You should see something like:

Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
fuse                   37232  0
ip_conntrack_tftp       1680  0
ip_nat_irc               960  0
ip_conntrack_irc        2832  1 ip_nat_irc
ip_nat_ftp              1696  0
ip_conntrack_ftp        4016  1 ip_nat_ftp
ppp_async               9504  0
ppp_generic            20480  1 ppp_async
slhc                    5472  1 ppp_generic
crc_ccitt               1024  1 ppp_async
cifs                  230816  0
switch_robo             4016  0
switch_core             5056  1 switch_robo
nls_base                4576  1 cifs
diag                    7696  0


That should be enough to get you started.  We&#039;ll come back to ipkg later.  Be sure to set a password 
for root on your box.  SSH will be disabled until you do so (I think, or it will just not have a password).

type:
 passwd
  *supply some password*

------------------------------
logging in via ssh
------------------------------

If you don&#039;t already have putty, download it, or use some linux alternative.

log in, i use root.  :D  You just set this password in the last step.

If you can&#039;t connect, you&#039;ve got problems.  Be sure you have your cat5 plugged into the wan port. If that
doesn&#039;t work, try the others.  If that still doesn&#039;t work, try manually setting the ipaddress. See the
ifconfig manpage for syntax.

You&#039;ll also want to do this if you&#039;re using the wan port:

 vi /etc/firewall.user  - uncomment these lines and reboot:

iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables        -A input_wan      -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

Be sure to comment those lines out later if you&#039;re not using it.

------------------------------
Configure wpa
------------------------------

Generate your wpa/psk key:

 wpa_passphrase your_essid_here your_wpa_key_here

It will print out what you see below, the network { ... }.  All you need is the PSK portion.
Copy and paste that into /etc/wpa.conf.  If you don&#039;t have wpa_passphrase, you&#039;ll need to install it.
I&#039;m not sure what package it comes in, but you can use any linux distro that has it.  It&#039;s just
a key generator.


Edit /etc/wpa.conf:

network={
       ssid=&quot;joe&quot;
       proto=WPA
       key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
       pairwise=TKIP
       group=TKIP
       psk=-----this should be your wpa key-----
}


Now try to connect...type these commands, replacing as necessary:

 wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta
 iwconfig ath0 essid &quot;joe&quot;
 ifconfig ath0  192.168.0.101 up
 /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -dd -Dmadwifi -iath0 -c/etc/wpa.conf

That last one should print a bunch of information.  If you don&#039;t see the word, DISCONNECTED or some other
errors, you are probably up and running in station mode, using wpa. If you don&#039;t see any errors, especially
things about a missing driver, skip to the next section, otherwise continue.

If you get an error complaining about a driver not being found, you need to modify a file. For the wgt634u it&#039;s
the config.mipsel file:

 vi trunk/package/wpa_supplicant/files/config.mipsel

# Driver interface for madwifi driver
CONFIG_DRIVER_MADWIFI=y
# Change include directories to match with the local setup
#CFLAGS += -I../madwifi/wpa
CFLAGS += -I/home/joe/madwifi-0.9.2.1

I guessed here and got it right.  I had to download the source code for madwifi-ng.  the cflags path
is the path to where i extracted that code.  There may be a better way to do this, but it works at least.

After you modify that file, you&#039;ll need to recompile wpa-supplicant:

 make package/wpa-supplicant-clean V=99 &amp;&amp; make package/wpa-supplicant-compile V=99

Then you&#039;ll need to remove wpa-supplicant from your device and reinstall:

 ipkg remove wpa-supplicant
 ipkg update
 ipkg install wpa-supplicant

You&#039;ll probably have to force the install (see ipkg doc) because the md5sum will be different (i think).

------------------------------
Autostart in wpa station mode
------------------------------

Edit /etc/init.d/madwifi:

#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
START=20
boot() {
#        iwpriv ath0 mode 3
    wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta
    iwconfig ath0 essid &quot;joe&quot;
    ifconfig ath0  192.168.0.101 up
    /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -dd -Dmadwifi -iath0 -c/etc/wpa.conf &amp;
}

This will put your ap into station mode, making it act much like a laptop would connecting to an ap.  It will
not serve as an ap if you use sta mode. If you want it to bridge and serve, look into using
wds mode.  Again, be sure to replace &quot;joe&quot; with your essid.

Type:

 cd /etc/rc.d
 ln -s /etc/init.d/madwifi S20madwifi

When finished...type:
 
 reboot

Watch it reboot and then try to log into 192.168.0.101 via ssh (remove the cat5 connection first).
If you connect, then you&#039;ve successfully connected your openwrt box to your ap using station mode with wpa.

------------------------------
Configuring sound
------------------------------

If everything above is working, this last part should be easy. All you have left to do now is install
mpd/mpc and your soundcore drivers, as well as install usb support.  There are a lot of posts about usb2 drivers
not working right, but I don&#039;t think those issues exist anymore.  Either way, it would be good to read about the
differences between ehci, ohci and uhci usb kernel modules. EHCI is only used for USB 2.0 high-speed devices and OHCI or UHCI
is used for other devices.  Google can provide more detail. If you didn&#039;t compile usb support as a module, then i&#039;d
go back and do that.  Sometimes, especially if you plan on hooking a hard drive up, it&#039;s nice to be able to switch what
usb module you use. Some work better with certain devices.  If it&#039;s compiled into the kernel you&#039;re stuck.  I use ohci
but i don&#039;t have a need for usb2 support.  If you&#039;re unsure, use lsusb to probe your usb device to see what version it
needs.

Back to ipkg...

 ipkg install kmod-soundcore
 ipkg install kmod-usb-core
 ipkg install kmod-usb-ohci

 reboot

On your dev machine,this part is a mystery to me. I don&#039;t know why these don&#039;t get copied when you install kmod-soundcore.
It may not be in the package, but you&#039;d think it would get copied.  I have not been able to get sound working with less
than this.  Perhaps i&#039;m doing it wrong, but there isn&#039;t a whole lot to go off here in terms of formal documentation, so
I had to guess a lot.  Trial and error, etc. First, find the module files.  Mine are in the path below.  Change to that directory
and then copy it to your packages directory.  If you symlinked this to your web root, you&#039;re done.  YOu need only wget them
to your device.  However you do it, you need to get these files into /lib/modules/2.6.19.x/

joe@linuxbox:/home/joe/trunk/build_mipsel/linux-2.6-brcm47xx/linux-2.6.19.2/sound#
cp ./core/snd-hwdep.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./core/snd-page-alloc.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./core/snd-pcm.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./core/snd-rawmidi.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./core/snd-timer.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./core/snd.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./usb/snd-usb-audio.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./usb/snd-usb-lib.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./core/oss/snd-mixer-oss.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/
cp ./core/oss/snd-pcm-oss.ko /home/joe/trunk/bin/packages/

***If you&#039;re missing the *oss.ko files, you need to enable it in your kernel build.

 make kernel_menuconfig  

Look under devices-&gt;sound-&gt;alsa and ensure you enabled snd_pcm_oss and snd_mixer_oss emulation drivers.  
Rebuild your openwrt (sorry) and you&#039;ll see the *oss.ko files in your build_mipsel path.


on your device:

 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-hwdep.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-page-alloc.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-pcm.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-rawmidi.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-timer.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-usb-audio.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-usb-lib.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-mixer-oss.ko
 wget http://192.168.0.103/apache2-default/openwrt/packages/snd-pcm-oss.ko

Again, substitute your webroot in place of mine.  After copying, reboot to make sure we get all of our modules
that came from any ipkg installations automatically loaded.  When done, add the following to your startup files
so that the modules will get loaded everytime.

 insmod snd.ko
 insmod snd-hwdep.ko
 insmod snd-page-alloc.ko
 insmod snd-timer.ko
 insmod snd-rawmidi.ko
 insmod snd-pcm.ko
 insmod snd-usb-lib.ko
 insmod snd-usb-audio.ko
 insmod snd-mixer-oss.ko
 insmod snd-pcm-oss.ko


um, this is where my doc ends, it isn&#039;t done.  you&#039;ll have to figure the rest out on your own for now.  perhaps you can complete this after you figure it out...</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>well that worked fine. I saw that the sizes of snd.ko and a couple others were different after including snd-mixer-oss and snd-pcm-oss, so I overwrote them all when I scp&#039;d them over. Then insmod&#039;d em like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>insmod snd
insmod snd-page-alloc
insmod snd-hwdep
insmod snd-rawmidi
insmod snd-timer
insmod snd-pcm
insmod snd-mixer-oss    
insmod snd-pcm-oss
insmod snd-usb-lib
insmod snd-usb-audio</code></pre></div><p>and voila! creates /dev/dsp and flite outputs to it just fine</p><p>to make it work on startup create the file /etc/modules.d/70-snd and put the above list in it (removing the &quot;insmod&quot; part of course)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bradkarhu</strong> on 29 Mar 2007, 06:45)</p>

					<p>Me too, the instructions worked great. Can someone turn this into a wiki/Howto for just the sound part, bet there are other that are struggling with this.</p><p>Would still love to see the rest of the setup (MPD/MPC and cifs) maybe even samba to access files remotely on a window workstation.</p>									</div>

					<p>A howto would certainly be nice but it would also be useful to figure out why the *.ko files need to be copied across<br />manually rather than automatically (or perhaps it&#039;s a feature I don&#039;t understand).&nbsp; &nbsp;Would certainly make it<br />easier than documenting the workaround of copying the files.</p><p>If somebody points me in the right direction I could take a look at why they&#039;re not coming across.&nbsp; (I&#039;ve been<br />using linux a while but I&#039;m an openwrt noob.&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps this would be a good way to throw myself into it.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Heh, I&#039;m glad you guys got it working.&nbsp; It took me a month of tinkering to finally figure out what it was.&nbsp; I think in the end, it was a blind guess that I was missing a linux module.&nbsp; I eventually stumbled on the make options for openwrt and noticed the kernel_menuconfig option and zing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like I said in my lame howto, i really don&#039;t know what i&#039;m doing with this stuff - i just sit and guess until it works, often moving from one false assumption to another until I find the real answer. I think it&#039;s fun that way though! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; </p><p>If any of you figure out how to get alsa w/o oss emulation working, please post it.</p><p>Also as for connecting to windows, cifs is what you want.&nbsp; You need kmod-fs-cifs and cifsmount.&nbsp; I suppose you could do it with samba, but cifs was a lot easier to get up and running.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok sweet, i didn&#039;t have a clue what i was doing but it worked the very first time. I have all the .ko&#039;s in an ipkg now.

					<p>Hey that&#039;s awesome!&nbsp; Will it automatically tick the settings in kernel_menuconfig as well?&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that if those settings aren&#039;t set, those oss.ko files don&#039;t get built. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
