					<p>I am trying to create a captive portal for a guest network I&#039;ve created by tapping into the wireless provided by a separate AP. That is, I have a device that is the AP for networkA, and I have a separate device that is repeater client for networkA, and uses that connection to provide Internet access for networkB. I want to implement coova as a captive portal for networkB. I have set up radiusDESK and FreeRadius on an AWS EC2 machine, and I would like coova to connect to this.</p><p>I have tried following a couple of tutorials: <a href="http://www.radiusdesk.com/user_guide/chilli/ubiquity_basic,">http://www.radiusdesk.com/user_guide/ch … ity_basic,</a> <a href="http://www.hotspotsystem.com/installation-guide-openwrt,">http://www.hotspotsystem.com/installati … e-openwrt,</a> but my efforts have not been successful.</p><p>Is what I&#039;m trying to do possible? If it is, can anyone provide some advice on how to make it work?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have done several coova-setups, on various HW (LINUX and openwrt), for clients: coova-chilli has quite a learning curve, so you should first try to get it up and running on the *simplest* (network) config, which means, using MAC-auth. Then add freeradius and finally use your special net config.<br />Should work, finally, I guess.</p>									</div>
