					<p>OK, I have OpenWRT running successfully on another router.&nbsp; However, I would like to try it on my WD N750.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my time to &quot;mess&quot; with it will be extremely limited.&nbsp; So I need to know before I start...will LUCI be installed/configured/enabled by default?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hate to answer my own question.&nbsp; But leaving a trail of bread crumbs in case others are curious.&nbsp; As of yesterday (2/10/14), the openwrt firmware that was tweaked to be compatible with the WD N750....</p><p>Does NOT include LUCI</p><p>So...you have to telnet and ssh into the router to mess around at the command line level to get LUCI installed.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually pretty easy if you are used to messing around with linux configuration in the pre-ubuntu period...</p><p>I have not had much time to test the openwrt firmware.&nbsp; (just installed it yesterday).&nbsp; But so far, my impression is that it is at least 1000% more stable than the factory firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp;I base this impression on...</p><p>The router with factory firmware would need to be reset at least every hour or three, due to losing Internet connection.&nbsp; This WD N750 with openwrt has maintained a solid openvpn connection all day so far (about 7 hours).&nbsp; So it&#039;s already doing a lot more work than it was before...and it is (so far) proving reliable...</p><p>Time will tell if the hardware really holds up well.&nbsp; But so far at least, it looks like openwrt turned a 30 buck piece of garbage into something that is actually kind of useful.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
