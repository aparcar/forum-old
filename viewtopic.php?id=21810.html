					<p>Sorry for bothering. I just bought an asus-wl500g router and my friends suggested me to install openwrt on it. It is my first time to run a<br />third-party firmware so I am very careful. But after some research on internet I found that it seems there is some problem about port forwarding for my router---<br />I am not quite familiar with third-party firmware so if I am asking a stupid question then I apologize for that. I read several articles but am still a little confused about<br />the current condition of that issue. Can anybody kindly tell me if the issue is still there, or have been fixed by some patches, or there should be no issue at all..</p><br /><p>SOrry for the stupid question. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>You question is not stupid. The issue is not fixed in 8.09.1, it will be fixed in the upcoming 8.09.2. You can obtain 8.09.2 RC builds here:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2-RC2/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2-RC2/</a></p><p>The final release of 8.09.2 will follow in the next days.</p><p>Regards,<br />JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>By the way, one more boring question... </p><br /><p>I read from openwrt wiki:</p><p>ASUS WL-500g Premium V2<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The redesigned version of the ASUS WL-500g Premium router, OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GP , has the following changes:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Broadcom BCM5354 CPU @ 240 Mhz (130nm process)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * On-board integrated wireless LAN controller<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * WLAN port and antenna port have changed sides </p><p>Support in trunk since changeset 10693.</p><p>USB NOTE: NO UHCI USB drivers needed... only EHCI are used</p><p>Sancho: After a long period of fiddling with the SVN trunk, patching, re-compiling, etc. I found out, that the wireless is simply not working. On the other hand, the Kamikaze with 2.4 kernel works just fine. The wireless is turned off, but it&#039;s enough to turn it on using web interface. Works like a charm than.</p></blockquote></div><p>Does that mean if I choose 2.6 kernel then still I have wlan unworkable? It is quite frustrating if it is true....<br />THanks</p>									</div>
