					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I would like to compile a 3rd party kernel module for my WRT54GS running the latest WhiteRussian release.<br />I&#039;ve tried the compilation with the OpenWrt SDK and the buildroot package, but the compiled module just didn&#039;t want to load on my router.<br />The module is a protocol booster, named WiCCP (Wireless Central Coordinated Protocol). I would like to give it a try, because some users on my WLAN often complain about very low transfer rates, mostly those, who are far from the access point (I think, this is the famous hidden node problem). Signal strengths are normal (about -80 dBm on most of the clients).<br />I&#039;ve read the instructions in the buildroot doc, but I think, that&#039;s only for modules, that are hosted on your server. At least, I didn&#039;t find any instructions on where to put the source files of the module for the compilation.<br />With using a makefile created by my own, I was able to successfully compile the module, but when I load it on the router, it doesn&#039;t operate as I would expect. I get some messages into the kernel log, but I see no errors or exceptions...<br />I applied the module on a bridge, I created, which contains three interfaces: eth1 and two WDS connections. The wired network is separated from this bridge.</p><p>I can think of two things:<br />- a broadcast storm happens, when a client tries to send some data, so this is a bug in the module.<br />- I compiled the module with wrong compiler options, that&#039;s why it causes strange problems.</p><p>I am very disappointed now, I spent a couple of days trying to set this thing up. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>By the way, Frottle is not an option for me, because all of the clients run Windows.</p><p>I would appreciate any help regarding this problem!</p><p>Thank you in advance:<br />George</p>									</div>
