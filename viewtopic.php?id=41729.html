					<p>@gigabyte091</p><p>in the first image, select PPPoE, then click switch protocol button. It will show up a screen where you can input username and password provided by your ISP provider. In the second image, I believed you have to select and tick button with Ethernet Adapter: &quot;nas0&quot; (wan) description. </p><p>Try it first.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>@ll@n416</strong> on 20 Jan 2013, 20:32)</p>

					<p>You&#039;re Welcome. </p><p>have you tried checking if you wifi is enabled? which version of OpenWrt you are using and installed? most of the time, wireless is enabled by default in OpenWrt Backfire and Attitude Adjustment. Why is your wan in DHCP? how are you connected to internet? how many ports do you have in your router? which port did you use when you connect to your friends internet? sorry, i don&#039;t have the unit you have.</p>									</div>
