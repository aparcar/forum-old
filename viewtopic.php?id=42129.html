					<p>We&#039;ve got a 25/25 mbit/s internet link shared by 16 people and we&#039;re looking for a new router. 1 or 2 100 mbit/s LAN ports, 1 WAN port and WLAN (N) are sufficient. We&#039;re currently running DD-WRT on a D-Link DIR-600 and running out of NAT entries (4096). It might just be the software, but I don&#039;t want to mess with the current router.<br />What&#039;d be a good router for us and what are the important specs? Just CPU, RAM and flash capacity?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are running out of NAT entries, you will need more RAM and increase the nat table size. That netgear has 128MB of ram, so it seems like a good choice to me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Most cheap routers has only 32MB RAM.</p>									</div>

					<p>The NAT table capacity in DD-WRT doesn&#039;t seem to be limited by (lack of) RAM, so RAM isn&#039;t necessarily an issue. In another topic the entry size was said to be 160 bytes, which is 6500+ entries/mb.</p>									</div>

					<p>Then you have probably answered yourself, any mimo router will fit your specs, I have tl wr841nd, it&#039;s fast and cheap, it has only 32MB ram, but I have more than 12MB free RAM with latest barrier breaker and unaltered nat table size.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi XTF,</p><p>there are tons of &quot;what is the best router&quot;-threads in this forum, and in almost every thread you will see, that you won&#039;t get a recommendation if you don&#039;t have specific requirements. </p><p>Nozombian already answered that any (recent) router will fullfill your requirements.</p><p>So, if you really have no specific requirements, there won&#039;t be a recommendation. </p><p>Flash-memory is important if you want to install a lot of packages.<br />RAM is important if you want to run memory-hungry applications.<br />CPU is important if you run CPU-intensiv applications (e.g. VPN) </p><p>25Mbit/s and 16 users needs none of that. <br />You could run this on a router with 400MHz CPU, 32MB RAM and 4MB flash (but I would recommend at least 8MB flash)</p>									</div>

					<p>I have no idea why you have 82% sirq. And it&#039;s really hard to figure it out without any info what happend at the moment&nbsp; you decided to take this top-output. <br />wlan-drivers tend to produce high sirq-values, especially older wlan-driver.<br />But you didn&#039;t post any detail so, it&#039;s no use to speculate. So lets just say it&#039;s DD-WRTs fault. </p><p>So some test of mine:</p><p>1. 120Mbit/s (netto) from WAN to wifi-client (NAT, firewall, QOS) on a 680MHz MIPS (Netgear WNDR-3700 v1) </p><p>CPU:&nbsp; &nbsp;0% usr&nbsp; &nbsp;1% sys&nbsp; &nbsp;0% nic&nbsp; 49% idle&nbsp; &nbsp;0% io&nbsp; &nbsp;0% irq&nbsp; 47% sirq<br />Load average: 0.02 0.02 0.05 1/50 17524</p><p>2. 120Mbit/s from WAN to LAN-client (NAT, firewall, QOS) on a 680MHz MIPS: Netgear WNDR-3700 v1 <br />CPU:&nbsp; &nbsp;0% usr&nbsp; &nbsp;0% sys&nbsp; &nbsp;0% nic&nbsp; 69% idle&nbsp; &nbsp;0% io&nbsp; &nbsp;0% irq&nbsp; 30% sirq<br />Load average: 0.12 0.04 0.05 1/49 17552</p><p>3. 140Mbit/s LAN to wifi-client&nbsp; (bridged)<br />CPU:&nbsp; &nbsp;0% usr&nbsp; &nbsp;1% sys&nbsp; &nbsp;0% nic&nbsp; 72% idle&nbsp; &nbsp;0% io&nbsp; &nbsp;0% irq&nbsp; 26% sirq<br />Load average: 0.03 0.04 0.05 1/49 17582</p><p>So yes, I really think a 400MHz MIPS-CPU should be able to handle 25Mbit/s.</p><p>So you can get something cheap like the tl-wr842nd <br />if you want gigabit you can get a tl-wr1043nd (or any other supported 400MHz atheros-router with gigabit!)</p><p>or if you want something faster with more flash/ram and with simultaneous dualband (2,4GHz+5GHz)<br />get one of these:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-ag300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-ag300h</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4310">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4310</a></p>									</div>
