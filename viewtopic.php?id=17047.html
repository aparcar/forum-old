					<p>Hi,<br />I have been pretty satisfied with my ar430w&#039;s wireless support in Kamikaze trunk (12634).&nbsp; And it seems like a pretty solid router as far as the features per price ratio goes.</p><p>However I was a bit dismayed to find that when using OpenWRT (and I believe DD-WRT, but I didn&#039;t try much with this), the ar430w does not seem to support tagged vlans.</p><p>The confusing thing is that with the stock Airlink firmware, it does seem to not only have separate WAN and LAN ports, but it also acts like a switch rather than a hub... Whereas, when using openwrt when one port gets a packet it seems to broadcast that packet to all other ports (I see all the lights flash at the same time for each one of the ARP requests that my cable modem sends).</p><p>Anyway, I have managed to barely get it to connect to my cable modem using a dhclient on an alias interface (I had to alias the &quot;br-lan&quot; interface because I can&#039;t seem to receive packets from eth0 while it is in the bridge).&nbsp; From there it should be possible to set up convoluted iptables rules where it looks only at the source and destination IP address to determine whether to masquerade or route, and trust that nothing will come through my cable line with a source address of &quot;192.168.1.x&quot;.</p><p>But something is screaming in me that this is not the right way to set up a router, and I am sure that the ar430w can at least in theory handle more than that.</p><p>Does anyone have experience with VLANs?&nbsp; Do I need nvram settings or to modify the redboot IP address config?&nbsp; Is this a deficiency of the kernel driver (though I don&#039;t understand why vlan tagging would be the responsibility of the NIC driver)?&nbsp; Is there an alternative to VLANs (like can I alias my mac address and sort packets by their destination MAC somehow?)</p><p>I have a feeling that some hardware register that allows for vlan tagging is disabled... (i.e. when I run wireshark on another machine it shows the 802.1Q information for each packet)</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow, thanks for mentioning that--I didn&#039;t notice that in the table of hardware, and no mention of it in strings /dev/mtd6ro or dmesg... but sure enough it looks like it is a big chip on the device itself, so it&#039;s hard to miss.</p><p>I guess I am going to have to look at hacking the drivers/net/phy/icplus.c driver<br />The specsheet has a lot of registers for vlans, and I&#039;m pretty sure the driver isn&#039;t setting up the vlans because the driver only ever sets a few registers for things like duplex mode.</p><p>If you look at pages 34-35 of the pdf describe how the vlans work.<br /><a href="http://www.icplus.com.tw/Data/Datasheet/IP175Cx-DS-R15-20080529.pdf">http://www.icplus.com.tw/Data/Datasheet … 080529.pdf</a> </p><p>There seem to be a lot of registers called &quot;MII&#039;s&quot; for each port.&nbsp; There is port 0,1,2,3,4,5 and also port 29 which is for the switch itself.<br />It looks like Port4 is the WAN port and port5 goes to the atheros CPU (that runs the ar2313.c driver).</p><p>PHY 29 defines mii 19-21 and each has a bytes that defines the ports that are part of &quot;the same VLAN as portN&quot;<br />The default value for both of these is 11111, so I assume that basically by default all ports are in all VLANs.</p><p>It has &quot;Vlan tags&quot;, which seem to default to good values--i.e. by default Port0,1,2,3 all have VLAN Tag 0x0001, and Port 4 has VLAN Tag 0x0002<br />There is also a lot of mention of a &quot;Port 5&quot;, and by default it also has VLAN Tag 0x0002.</p><p>PHY 30 has another port mask register for each VLAN, defaulting to 00101111 and 00110000 respectively, which make sense for port 4.<br />By default Port 4 is tagged as a &quot;WAN port&quot; and the others are not.<br />&quot;TAG_VLAN_EN. Enable tag VLAN function&quot; defaults to OFF.<br />&quot;ROUTER_EN. Enable router function at MII port&quot; defaults to OFF.<br />&quot;LAN_GROUPS[2:0] Number of VLAN groups of LAN ports in a router application&quot; defaults to 1 [edit: 1 does make sence since it&#039;s vlan groups of lan ports only]</p><p>So I&#039;m thinking we need to enable the &quot;router&quot; mode, the &quot;tag vlan&quot; mode, and make sure that ports 0,1,2,3,5 are all flagged as in the same vlan groups, and that port 4,5 are also flagged as in the same vlan group.</p><p>Anyway after I finish my midterms that I should be studying for, I&#039;ll play around with some of this driver code.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try and see if I can make it build as a module (and pray that it boots up with wireless)--otherwise I will have to reflash the kernel each time I make any change which will be quite annoying to test.</p><p>But it looks like there&#039;s a good chance that we can get this to work with the help of a detailed specsheet and a simple but already working kernel module (though maybe I&#039;ll start by putting printk&#039;s so I know it&#039;s actually initializing that kernel module)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phorn</strong> on 23 Sep 2008, 00:13)</p>

					<p>Awesome!<br />So they already have a userspace way of setting and getting MII&#039;s with the SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCSMIIREG ioctls.&nbsp; Which means I don&#039;t have to reflash the kernel in order to set them.</p><p>I&#039;ll look at that dd-wrt code and see if I can get a simple program that (if I run it over wireless) that sets the vlan modes.<br />Then once I get that working, I can try and setup the /proc/switch&nbsp; to run the same ioctls except from the switch kernel driver.</p><p>I&#039;m a bit confused on why dd-wrt was broken on my ar430w and didn&#039;t seem to support vlans either, since it was supposedly configured as a dir-300... but in my case I may have forgotten to reset the nvram or something like that.</p><p>Does DD-WRT work correctly for you?</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright, I got a proof of concept (ugly, but if I run this program it will convert it from a hub into a router).&nbsp; Thanks for all your help th0m4s.</p><p>I took the DD-WRT souce code you linked to, removed the sysinit function that messes with the board config, and added<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    vlan_init( );       // 0xff = 4 lan + 1 wan

					<p>Basically, there are a few problems with the AR430W and related devices that have all been solved but not released yet.&nbsp; First, in 7.09, wireless is not supported.&nbsp; Secondly, you need trunk for switch support and you also need a patch and a userspace program to enable VLANs.</p><p>First, you need to be using OpenWRT trunk -- check that you have the latest revision of SVN.<br />Secondly, you must apply a kernel patch:<br /><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathorn/ip175c/">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathorn/ip175c/</a><br />Download the 990-phyfix.patch and place it in your &quot;kamikaze/target/linux/atheros/patches-2.6.26/&quot; folder.</p><p>Now, compile the image, and then install it using the files in &quot;kamikaze/bin&quot; and the tutorial on the wiki for installing ar430w.</p><p>Then, download the &quot;user-switch&quot; program off my site (this is in binary form but you can compile it if you want) and scp it to your router.<br />Log in with SSH or Telnet and run:<br />/root/user-switch +v &quot;&quot; &quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot; &quot;4 5&quot;<br />(I would advise that you first set-up wireless as it will cause your ethernet connection to cut out.)<br />Now, you have to set-up VLANs using the &quot;switch&quot; uci variables in /etc/config/network to use VLANS 1 and 2, for example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan
        option ifname   eth0.1
        option type     bridge
        option proto    static
        option ipaddr   192.168.1.1
        option netmask  255.255.255.0

config interface wan
        option ifname   eth0.2
        option proto    dhcp</code></pre></div><p>!!!Beware!!! the way I have it set up, the &quot;user-switch&quot; program will not run at boot.&nbsp; To do so make a simple script like /etc/init.d/vlans, something like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vconfig add eth0 1
vconfig add eth0 2

/root/user-switch +v &quot;&quot; &quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot; &quot;4 5&quot;</code></pre></div><p>and make a symlink to /etc/rc.d:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ln -s /etc/init.d/vlans /etc/rc.d/S38vlans</code></pre></div><p>So be prepared to reflash your router, no warranty, etc. etc. you are probably the third person to try this.<br />You can also wait a bit and (hopefully) some of these patches will make their way into the 8.09 RC1</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I can tell you the first thing you should do is not double-post your questions in the forum.&nbsp; That&#039;s a good way for your questions to go unanswered.&nbsp; Unlike DD-WRT and Tomato, OpenWRT is typically not distributed with a web interface.&nbsp; You might download a build from x-wrt.org, or look at the bottom of this post for the steps I use for building from trunk.</p><p>That said, I&#039;d love to see an update on the AR430W...&nbsp; I check here every few days and all the AR430W/DIR-300 stuff is pretty old.&nbsp; I&#039;d really like to know if phorn&#039;s switch stuff (<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathorn/ip175c/">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathorn/ip175c/</a>), etc., has been incorporated into 8.09.&nbsp; If not, I wonder if anyone might provide guidance on the steps needed to obtain the last known stable 7.09/8.09 build on the AR430W.&nbsp; My attempts at using the instructions on the above link have been pretty fruitless.<br />-katapaltes</p><p>$ cd ~/<br />$ svn checkout <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/">https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/</a> ~/trunk/<br />$ cd ~/trunk/<br />$ ./scripts/feeds update packages luci<br />$ ./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci<br />$ make menuconfig</p><p>In menuconfig change:</p><p>- Target System</p><p>- Administration<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- LuCI Components<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- luci-admin-full: Y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- luci-app-ddns: Y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- luci-app-firewall: Y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- luci-app-ntpc: Y<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- luci-app-qos: Y</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I have made things really confusing.&nbsp; Basically I made a few different versions:<br />A very simple user-space program that only allows you to change settings, but it requires a kernel patch.</p><p>Then there are three different drivers because I have had requests from a few different people:<br />- A switch driver that uses the same system as &quot;robo-switch&quot; and uses network devices like eth0.&nbsp; I called this one version 2 since it is older and isn&#039;t as good (but just in case someone has compatibility issues with using the phy layer directly)<br />- A switch driver that uses the phydev directly. (I called this one version 3, I recommend you use this)<br />- A swconfig driver that uses the phydev directly (nbd wrote a new switch configuration system for 8.09,&nbsp; but there is nothing that uses it yet and so it&#039;s a little buggy)</p><p>At the moment I would go with version 3, which you can download here:<br /><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathorn/ip175c/icplus-v3.patch">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathorn/ … s-v3.patch</a><br />To compile with subversion do:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ svn update
$ patch -p1 &lt; ~/Desktop/icplus-v3.patch
$ make menuconfig
*** At this point, make sure to select &quot;Kernel modules&quot;, &quot;Network Support&quot;, and select kmod-switch, and make it built-in (hit &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;*&quot;)
$ make</code></pre></div><p>and that should be it.&nbsp; Make sure it created a &quot;switch-core.ko&quot; and &quot;switch-ip175c.ko&quot;. Then flash the router.&nbsp; If they are not there, you can always scp them to /lib/modules/2.6.26.whatever/ afterwards.</p><p>Then, to configure the switch first check that you have the folder &quot;/proc/switch/0&quot; and then run these UCI commands:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.0=switch
uci set network.0.vlan1=&quot;0 1 2 3 5*t&quot;
uci set network.0.vlan2=&quot;4 5t&quot;
uci set network.lan.ifname=&quot;eth0.1&quot;
uci set network.wan.ifname=&quot;eth0.2&quot;
/etc/init.d/network restart
# Don&#039;t commit until you are sure things are working.
uci commit</code></pre></div><p>If you prefer editing the file, add:<br />config switch eth0<br />option vlan1 &quot;0 1 2 3 5*t&quot;<br />option vlan2 &quot;4 5t&quot;</p><p>and change the ifname of both LAN and WAN to say &quot;eth0.1&quot; and &quot;eth0.2&quot;</p><p>Here&#039;s a thread with some more people testing the ip175c switch (though not on a normal atheros system)<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17501&amp;p=3">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17501&amp;p=3</a></p><br /><p>(Got to try flashing with LUCI pre-installed.&nbsp; I made the mistake of filling up my JFFS space by trying to install it afterwards)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, phorn, for taking the time to update the thread (not to mention, publishing your fixes).&nbsp; The steps worked well up to the point where this command was entered:<br />uci set network.wan.ifname=&quot;eth0.2&quot;<br />The uci command threw an error that I can&#039;t remember now...&nbsp; If I entered the following lines in /etc/config/network, then I could use the above uci command without error, but it might not have been needed at that point:<br />config interface wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth0.2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; dhcp<br />Even when I was able to enter all commands by adding them to /etc/config/network or whatnot, I couldn&#039;t produce a working router.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a biggie for me, certainly - I use two stable Tomato routers with WDS/WPA - but it was fun to try.&nbsp; I just added this post in case anyone else is having trouble.<br />By the way, I put a 30Nov2008 DD-WRT release on the AR430W today and Client Bridge is still not behaving on this router, at least not with WPA/AES (and Tomato/Broadcom on the AP).&nbsp; Streaming from a Windows SMB share to an Xbox works for several minutes and then dies under moderate load.<br />-katapaltes</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>katapaltes</strong> on 2 Dec 2008, 02:50)</p>
