					<p>Hi guys/gals,</p><p>I have a hopefully, short question about kernels and kernel modules as it pertains to ipkg on openwrt.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been hacking away at my two WGT634Us for a few months now, about since Christmas actually.&nbsp; I&#039;ve enjoyed it a great deal and well, thanks. This project is a lot of fun for me, mostly because it challenges me so much.&nbsp; Anyway, to the question...</p><p>I compiled the latest revision, or as of a few days ago.&nbsp; I flashed one of my non-working WGTs and everything was working fine, until I started installing some ipkgs.&nbsp; Every now and then, I get something like this:</p><p>cifs: version magic &#039;2.6.19.2 mod_unload MIPS32_R1 32BIT &#039; should be &#039;2.6.19.1 mod_unload MIPS32_R1 32BIT &#039; </p><p>That only shows on the console connection, not my ssh window.&nbsp; End result, the package in this case, kmod-fs-cifs didn&#039;t install b/c of some kernel mismatch.&nbsp; Honestly, I don&#039;t know how this could have happened.&nbsp; I nuked my build tree, actually did a &quot;rm -rf trunk/&quot; and &quot;rm -rf packages/&quot;, which erases all of the openwrt svn data on my pc.&nbsp; I did this b/c I wanted to be sure my svn pull was fresh. Overkill, I know.</p><p>So, i ran one build, building for atheros on the 2.6 kernel and half of my ipkgs it seems refer to 2.6.19.1 while the rest point to 2.6.19.2.&nbsp; Frustrating to say the least. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; ipkg creates two directories in the /lib/modules folder and well, you guessed it, the .2 modules won&#039;t load, so i&#039;m definitely running on the .1 version. How I ended up with two versions from one make/build process, I don&#039;t know, especially considering my earlier steps. </p><p>The only thing I can think of is that I compiled wpa_supplicant on it&#039;s own several times trying to get the atheros driver to compile, which i finally did (and my router is in WPA using sta mode) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, I nuked my build tree again, tweaked my madwifi config.mipsel file again to get my atheros driver and i&#039;m recompiling the whole stinking thing.&nbsp; In about seven hours, i&#039;ll be able to give it another go, but in the meantime, i&#039;m curious to see if anyone has any ideas about what I did. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>-j</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you completely reflashing the router with the new build too? If not I guess you can check to make sure your router is running the 2.6.19.2 kernel.

					<p>So far, the other ipkgs that I have had this problem with was the wpa-supplicant and wpa-cli, although i managed to fix those by compiling the packages individually.&nbsp; For some reason, it worked after that.&nbsp; (make package/wpa-supplicant-clean V=99 &amp;&amp; make package/wpa-supplicant-compile V=99) etc.</p><p>I checked the linux version and the mystery continues.&nbsp; My source bz2 file is 2.6.19.2.&nbsp; Crazy.&nbsp; The method i&#039;ve been using to flash.... a serial cable, hyperterminal (grin), and ctrl-c to get into the cfe.&nbsp; After that,</p><p>1) setup my ethernet interface<br />ifconfig eth0 -addr=192.168.0.101 -mask=255.255.255.0</p><p>2) go get my bin file<br />flash -noheader 192.168.0.103:openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin flash0.os</p><p>I&#039;ve been doing this for awhile, I assumed that (mistake?) that it erased the current flash doing it this way.&nbsp; If not, that might explain things.&nbsp; I did have an earlier build of openwrt on this router prior to this weirdness.&nbsp; If it&#039;s as simple as issuing some erase command. ugh. </p><p>root@OpenWrt:/# cat /proc/version<br />Linux version 2.6.19.1 (root@linux) (gcc version 3.4.6 (OpenWrt-2.0)) #1 Fri Dec<br /> 22 12:36:03 CST 2006</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sneakywombat</strong> on 19 Mar 2007, 22:18)</p>

I suggest - if you don&#039;t have important stuff on your router - to just flash kamikaze fresh to the wgt (flash -noheader 192.168.0.103:openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin flash0.os). Looks like the last time you did this was back on Dec 22nd, probably when kamikaze was using the 2.6.19.1 kernel. An mtd -r linux &lt;image.trx&gt; thing should work as well, but I&#039;m not familiar with it yet.</p>									</div>
