					<p>i have a tp-link archer c7. i decided to do a full factory reinstall using the reboot/press wps/reset button and tftping the file up with the latest (30th Dec 2014) trunk</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots â€¦ actory.bin</a></p><p>everything went well. except this version i have doesn&#039;t appear to work (can&#039;t seem to change the mac address for my wan, wireless appears broken etc.). what i would like to do is to downgrade the unit /back/ to BB.</p><p>so i tried the reboot/reset to tftp again... but it doesn&#039;t seem to work; i&#039;ve tried 192.168.1.66 and 192.168.0.66 (as per the docs) and it just doesn&#039;t bite.</p><p>so, i know i can sysupgrade /up/ versions, can i do the same going down?</p><p>or would i be better served with mtd&#039;ing:</p><p>$ mtd -r write /tmp/openwrt-ar71xx-blah-squashfs-factory.bin firmware</p><p>cheers,</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks hnyman,</p><p>do you know if the mtd would work as well? i don&#039;t really care to keep any configs, and i suppose doing a sysupgrade won&#039;t help as all my config files won&#039;t work anyway (eg with wifi).</p>									</div>

					<p>You use sysupgrade.bin when flashing a live Openwrt system. Both with mtd and with &quot;sysupgrade&quot; (which is a wrapper script around mtd...)</p><p>&quot;factory.img&quot; usually just contains an extra header so that the firmware matches the ID required by the OEM vendor flashing code. Otherwise it is usually identical to the sysupgrade version. So factory.img is needed only when flashing a router still running the OEM vendor software, or when the flashing is done using OEM recovery mode (TFTP etc.).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 30 Dec 2014, 11:00)</p>
