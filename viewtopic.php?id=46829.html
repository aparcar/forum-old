					<p>Hello Friends,</p><p>first of all, i want to say i am quite new to all of this, i came here and to the OpenWRT by the project i want to make.<br />My goal is, that i want to see who is around my WiFi, even if he is not connected to my WiFi.<br />Therefore i want the time, the mac-address, and whatever else information i can get.<br />All devices with activated WiFi send some kind of &quot;hello&quot; now and than, this package i want to grab and analyse.</p><p>After a lot of research i found, that this should be doable with openWRT and KISMET. Therefore i ordered myself a router ( TL-WR1043ND ) and will try to install openWRT on it. ( I found firmware for my version).</p><p>My question now is, does anybody has experience in that field that might help me?</p><p>I didnt understand how KISMET works so for, does the standard logs already give me the informations that i need?</p><p>Would be very useful for me (obviously <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />) to get in touch with people who know what they are talking about, cause whatÂ´s waiting for me in evening is more of a &quot;try-n-error&quot; session :-)</p><p>Thanks and best regards,</p><p>Mox</p>									</div>
