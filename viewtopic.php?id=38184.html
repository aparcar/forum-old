					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;ve just started looking into OpenWRT to have a mess about with and maybe improve my old routers performance. It&#039;s a Netgear DG834g V2. I have patched the boot loader and I eventually got the DGTeam firmware to install. But I can&#039;t seam to get OpenWRT to work. I&#039;m struggling as it is so old now, most of the tutorials and forum posts are out of date or of no help. </p><p>Basically when I have flashed with <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar7/openwrt-ar7-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ uashfs.bin</a> and I reboot by switching off the router when it is complete, then switch back on, the power light comes on along with the ethernet port 1 light. The orange tick flashes as you would expect, goes out, then seconds later the power and tick lights start alternatively flashing. Which to me is the recovery behaviour. </p><p>At this point I&#039;m a bit stuck as what to do. I have repeated this a few times all with the same result. I plan on trying an older version of OpenWRT but I&#039;m not quite sure where to start. Is there anyone that could suggest anything I could try differently from these symptoms?</p><p>I have followed the wiki and a few other tutorials. </p><p>Thanks</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually managed to figure the alternating flashing out. Somehow the boot loader either reverted back to default or it hadn&#039;t worked. Now the router has a constant power light with a flashing orange tick. I read that this was the unpacking of OpenWRT. Except, it has been flashing like that for nearly 12 hours now!</p><p>What does this mean?</p>									</div>
