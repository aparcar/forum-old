					<p>I have a ddwrt54gl v1.1 with a 1gb SDA card add on, running dd-wrt, in a fan cooled box up on a 15 meter tower and attached to a 22 dbi gain parabolic antenna attached to a mechanical rotor that I can control from the ground.&nbsp; Actually there are two antennas and routers on the tower - the top one on the rotor, and the pole can be mechanically twisted.&nbsp; I wanted two lan feeds as I plan to mix bandwidth with two LAN cards in a box running RouterOS load balancing software.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I&#039;ll get greedy and make a Christmas tree out of that pole with branches of antennas and router ornaments.</p><p>Here is my question: I want to install Wicrawl <a href="http://midnightresearch.com/projects/wicrawl/">http://midnightresearch.com/projects/wicrawl/</a> in the router, but wicrawl doesnt run inside a shell command, and it isn&#039;t in the Opt packages, so I don&#039;t know how to get it to work with a router, as opposed to with a wifi card.</p><p>I&#039;m assuming to run it I&#039;d need to do this:<br />1) install a swap partition on the SDA card and configure the router to use it (the card is soldered directly to wires, and the router is already up the tower - can I format it from here?)<br />2) install a graphical front end such as gnome or kde desktop into the router<br />3) install a vnc server into it<br />4) install wicrawl - possibly by creating an Opt package for it.<br />5) run wicrawl through vnc viewer on my local computer.</p><p>The problem is I have no idea if #2 and #3 and even #4 are possible.</p><p>On a different note, I was able to install an older optware ported version of aircrack-ng in the router, and plan to figure out how to get the newer version working in there.&nbsp; Can I just copy files from my linux box to the SDA card into the same locations the older version files are?&nbsp; </p><p>But wicrawl seems much faster and easier and more intuitive, and it would be too perfectly geeky cool to get that hacked into a wrt54gl.&nbsp; </p><p>Anyone want to help?&nbsp; I can pay a few paypal dollars for progress.</p><p>A few notes: I have Optware installed, and access the files on the SDA card using WinSCP.&nbsp; It took me many hours last troubling with learning how to transfer files, unsuccessfully trying to use sftp in shell to move files, and trying to set up an FTP server.&nbsp; WinSCP in Ubuntu under Wine works a treat.&nbsp; I struggled to get a samba share working under CIFS and using Ubuntu, but gave up and opted for the SDA card hack.&nbsp; Cost $6 for the card, and I paid a repair shop guy $5.00 for the soldering.&nbsp; I&#039;d still like to get Samba working, but from what I understand many people have spent many sleepless nights and given up.&nbsp; I wish there were some hardware hack to install a usb hard drive through an sda interface, as I expect the SDA card to wear out after a while, and it transmits data at a slow 180kbps.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need the hard drive in the router for file sharing over a lan, the functionality I need is to run wardriving applications through an antenna that has very high gain and transmission power.&nbsp; If there were some wireless access point that was hackable to alter at will transmission signal strength, I wouldn&#039;t need to mess around with installing gnome desktop and a vpn server into a glorified radio.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think an imported $100 1 watt signal amplifier would make my C-band dish antenna neighbours happy, nor the other wifi consumers in the area, and I&#039;m too lazy to twist it amps in and of the wire as needed, and in any case, I&#039;d lose a lot of reception strength down a long (and expensive) wire going up the tower.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got to use cat 5 going up to an antenna that can vary signal transmission, and I&#039;ve got to either run a full OS on that router/antenna, or have a pure radio recognized as wifi service and not a lan.</p>									</div>
