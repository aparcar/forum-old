					<p>Dear All,</p><p>I&#039;m using &quot;Chaos Calmer 15.05.1&quot; together with OpenVPN and OpenSSL (opkg openvpn-openssl).</p><p>Due to the fact that many critical security issues have been fixed in OpenSSL recently, I&#039;d like to update my OpenWRT installation.</p><p>I tried to find out the &quot;intended way&quot; to do that, but I wasn&#039;t successful.</p><p>Can someone please tell me how to update OpenSSL (in my setup) to the latest version?</p><br /><p>I already found changeset 49295 (see below) which seem to cover that issue. But when I tried &quot;opkg update / opkg list-upgradable&quot; no new package showed up.</p><p>Do I just&nbsp; have to wait a little bit longer? Where can I see, when the new package will be released?<br />Do I have to compile and upgrade the package manually?<br />Do I have to install the latest build of 15.05.01?<br />Do I&nbsp; have to install the latest trunk build?</p><p>I&#039;m only interested in the &quot;intended way&quot;... of course, there might be several ways, but what is the &quot;security design&quot; of OpenWRT?</p><p>Thank you in advance<br />oil_lamp</p><br /><p>Changeset 49295 <br />---<br />&quot; openssl: Update to version 1.0.2h</p><p>Bump to the latest version, fixes several security issues:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2109, CVE-2016-2176 &quot;<br />---</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi booBot,</p><p>thank you for that hint. I will also have a look at the build environment - however it sounds like a lot of effort.</p><p>Therefore I will try to understand the new/fixed vulnerabilities in more detail. As the effort to fix them is higher than expected, it makes sense to spend additional time and investigate, what the impact on my environment would be.</p><p>I still want to believe that if there is a really serious security issue, someone from the OpenWRT team would fix it (call me dreamer <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)</p><p>Kind Regards<br />oil_lamp</p>									</div>

					<p>Congratualtions!

					<p><strong>oil_lamp</strong>, the compiled result looks exactly the way all official OpenWrt modules do: <em>libopenssl_1.0.2h<strong>-1</strong>_ramips_24kec.ipk</em>, it is installable from a local folder (<strong><em>opkg install /tmp/libopenssl_1.0.2h-1_ramips_24kec.ipk</em></strong>).<br />So, I think it IS the way to get patched/fixed components as soon as they are published by their authors - without an unneeded delay.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you all for your comments.</p><p>I&#039;m new to openWrt so I&#039;d like to sum it up:</p><br /><p>1. BooBot: you created your own build environment which is<br />- specific to your hardware<br />- able to compile versions of single packages (no need to reinstall the whole software)<br />- self-compiled packages can be installed via standard opkg (with link to local file as described in comment 11)</p><p>2. BooBot: in order the compile the new version of a single package, you modified a config file &quot;Makefile&quot; and ran the compile process as described in comment 7</p><p>3. @tmo26 if I read your comment 10 right, you did the modifaction BooBot mentioned in the &quot;official&quot; OpenWrt build environment.<br />- Is that just to see, how the modification looks like or will your change result in an updated package version somewhere in &quot;<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/&lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;/generic/packages/base/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … ages/base/</a>&quot; i.e. I don&#039;t have to create my own build environment<br />- If yes, when will that happen... I&#039;ve read something about a build-bot. But is this bot still running for Chaos Calmer?</p><p>4. @maurer, thank you for providing the files already. I appreciate that very much. However, in this case of &quot;security software&quot; I just want to use my own files or files from the official repository. Please don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s my paranoia...</p><p>Kind Regards<br />oil_lamp</p>									</div>
