					<p>Hello folks, this is my first post here!</p><p>Although I&#039;m a complete Linux noob, I&#039;ve so far managed to install OpenWRT RC6 on my Wl500gP and gotten my usb sound card (c-media) to work just fine. I&#039;m using this set-up to wirelessly stream audio from my laptop to my stereo, which, in theory, is a great thing to do! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thing is, i&#039;m not really pleased with the quality of the playback i&#039;m getting. To be precise, i&#039;m experiencing random crackles and pops in the audio when streaming from my lappy. They don&#039;t come very often, but often enough to be irritating. This doesn&#039;t happen when playing mp3 streams directly from the net, and it&#039;s also better when using ethernet cable from computer to router. So my conclusion is that the crackles and pops come from tiny latency gaps in the wifi connection. I&#039;m thinking that the problem should be fixed if the router could buffer maybe a second of audio before playing it. I&#039;ve tried using both esd and madplay (using netcat as well as wget), but to my knowledge none of these support buffering. I&#039;ve been unable to get mpd running properly since i seem to be needing mpc which I can&#039;t find. And I don&#039;t know how to compile.</p><p>So my question is the following: Are there any mp3 players or sound streamers available for OpenWRT that are able to buffer some of the sound before playing it? Or do you linux wizards have any other solutions for my problem? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>try to use OSS instead of Alsa kernel modules and esd with OSS support. It worked for me to overcome problems with pops in the sound.</p><p>Mirek</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,<br />It seems that there are no Alsa or any other drivers for ver 0.9 anymore. How can I find those. And a walktrough for installing USB Sound stick (lets say C-Media) would be much appriciated. I&#039;m still seeking info how to do that on version Whiterussian 0.9.</p>									</div>
