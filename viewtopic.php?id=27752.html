					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve mounted my WRT54GL (running OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 with 2.4 kernel) into a waterproof container and hung it in a tree.<br />This has been working fine for a few weeks; but I can&#039;t help but wonder what temperature the cpu is hitting with no ventilation holes<br />in the container.</p><p>Is there an easy way to determine the cpu temperature?<br />The access point currently doesnt have access to the internet, which makes packages impossible to install.</p><p>james</p>									</div>

					<p>Some systems have built-in hardware monitoring that you can monitor the cpu/system temp with, but not the WRT54GL (AFAIK).&nbsp; You could always mount a wireless temp probe or a USB temp probe (if you mod your WRT54GL with USB 1.1)... but seems kinda silly to go through all that trouble.&nbsp; You could also just stick a thermometer in there and check it manually... climb the tree <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>On another note, you don&#039;t have to have internet access on your AP to install packages.&nbsp; You could download the packages manually from a PC, then transfer them to the AP (with wget from a ftp serve, etc), then install them.</p>									</div>
