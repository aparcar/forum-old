					<p>Hey Folks,</p><p>All the real-time Luci stats are all 0. Needless to mention, the graphs are also not showing up. Any pointers greatly appreciated as to how I can go about fixing this problem. I&#039;ve attached a screenshot below.</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/cw0pa8rq1/">postimg.org/image/cw0pa8rq1/</a></p><p>I should also mention that I installed luci_app_statistics and those graphs are working perfectly.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rootuser</strong> on 8 Jan 2017, 11:15)</p>

					<p>If you don&#039;t care about the historical data, you could reinstall luci-app-statistics. I had the same issue as you, but that was because i was trying to get the historical data to save to USB and i didn&#039;t do that correctly. lol</p><p>Good references.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci_app_statistics">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci_app_statistics</a></p><p><a href="https://advanxer.com/blog/2013/02/openwrt-monitoring-using-collectd/">https://advanxer.com/blog/2013/02/openw â€¦ -collectd/</a></p>									</div>
