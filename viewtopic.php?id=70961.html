					<p>Hello guys, I&#039;m from Brazil and I&#039;m using it for the first time OPEN-WRT, and I had a doubt. my router is a TP-LINK of two antennas, so apparently he has two NICs. but only one is transmitting. How could I transmit using the two antennae the same SSID and the same network. because an antenna would be pointed to one side, and the other antenna would be pointed in another direction. Thanks guys:)</p>									</div>

					<p>KKKKK, like I said, it&#039;s my first time. I was frightened when I could create multiple WiFi networks, so I thought every network would occupy an antenna. So it&#039;s just I leave a broadcast that it will be transmitted by the two antennas?
