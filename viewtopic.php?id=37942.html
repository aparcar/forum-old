					<p>Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;I re-installed the router to blow away all the screwed up configs.&nbsp; Luckily I had backed up my config before hand.. so just re-flashed, restored, and I was back online. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I just installed luci-app-statistics, and changed the 1 directory you show for rrd to go to my usb key. </p><p>I see it putting stuff there now.</p><p>But under Collectd --&gt; Network Plugins, I selected a couple more interfaces to watch/graph.&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked Save/Apply, but they aren&#039;t graphing... no data files.</p><p>I rebooted the router to be sure.&nbsp; It shows the interfaces selected.&nbsp; The &quot;monitor all but specified&quot; isn&#039;t ticked.&nbsp; But no data seems to be coming in.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry if I wasn&#039;t clear. </p><p>Basically all I installed was luci-app-statistics after I did a reinstall of OpenWRT.&nbsp; &nbsp;It installed Collectd with a few plugins.&nbsp; </p><p>I made the cahnge to my usb key in the Output plugins. like you showed in your picture.</p><p>I saw it create the /mnt/usb/rrd/router/&lt;folders&gt;</p><p>in those folder is rdd files, but the graphs don&#039;t actually show anything.&nbsp; even when I&#039;m pulling down data on wan</p><p>then in my config i told it under network plugins --&gt; interfaces I highlighted a couple more than just br-lan.&nbsp; but those data files don&#039;t show up.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure where you say that db file should be at.&nbsp; &nbsp;I checked under /mnt/usb/mnt/router/&nbsp; &nbsp;but there is no plugin directory or db directory.</p><p>the thing is, and I&#039;m thinking this is a bug, but not 100%&nbsp; is my /etc/config/luci_statistics shows the options and paths that I selected</p><p>but the /etc/collectd.conf shows the paths, but not the plugins, like rdd or interfaces, etc.&nbsp; </p><p>if I edit and then restart, there will be a back up of my conf file created and the symlink for collectd.conf to /var/etc put back with missing info (i suspect missing info).</p>									</div>
