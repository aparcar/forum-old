When your are inside the lan is the same.</p><p>In OpenVPN you can push a route. This go to the routing table of the client host. If this route is in the same subnet you will have problems always. <br />There is a lot of information about networking but always you will learn when the problem is there!</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>RangerZ wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>My config and the issue I am trying to solve can be found here.&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59249">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59249</a>&nbsp; ...but I see you found that.</p></blockquote></div><p>Ok i will put my response on this topic.</p><br /><br /><p>Best regards.<br />gamba47</p>									</div>
