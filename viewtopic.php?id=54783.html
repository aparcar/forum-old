					<p>Good morning,<br />In <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54658,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54658,</a> the author was describing how to set the the DNS servers based in the MAC address. I was wondering if it is possible to have an interface (LAN) that creates a bridge over my different WiFi and assigns different DNS servers to the WiFi client based on the SSID. The reason I would like to have this is simple: I want to be able to easily switch between DNS servers for a couple of clients while they should still be able to control my SONOS systems, which is only possible if the the client and the SONOS systems are on the same subnet.<br />Thanks for your help, mercator - good night.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mercator</strong> on 28 Dec 2014, 02:13)</p>
