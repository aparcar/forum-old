					<p>I did some searching and didn&#039;t find an answer to this;</p><p>Using a Linksys WRT54G v3 with OpenWRT full, is it possible to setup an Anonymous Proxy? Work blocks a few sites I deem important for IT research and the sysadmin&#039;s don&#039;t get to unblock things so easily (big companies aren&#039;t always the easiest to convince otherwise...) so i was thinking I&#039;d just redirect traffic through my home connection.</p><p>Anyone successfully done this with OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>Pretty much, yes. I&#039;ve been using TunnelBear, which seems to work great, however it has a monthly cap at 500MB which is generally plenty, however a few apps i use don&#039;t seem to like it.</p>									</div>
