					<p>Please forgive me if this has been answered here before.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure enough of the terminology to know how to search for it directly.&nbsp; Let me summarize briefly what I&#039;m looking for, and feel free to point me to a relevant thread if one exists.</p><p>I have one lan subnet: 192.168.1.0/24.<br />I give out DHCP addresses in range 192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.254.<br />I have static DHCP leases in the range of 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.127.<br />There are wired and wireless devices in each category (static and dynamic).<br />All the wired devices connect to the same switch.&nbsp; I could segregate them if I have to.</p><p>I want anything with a dynamic DHCP lease to have access only to the internet (and maybe each other).&nbsp; I want anything with a static DHCP lease to have access to every device on the network.</p><p>I have a hunch that splitting the /24 subnet into two /25 subnets is a part of the solution (and if so, is it possible to split 75/25 (or more precisely 191/255) rather than 50/50?).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how to set up the routing to accomplish this.&nbsp; If possible, I&#039;d love to be able to configure all this through the web interface.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
