					<p>Hi Max,</p><p>others might realize that you just demonstrated how you were &quot;exploiting a language barrier for personal gain&quot; until you were happy with the resulting response. If you truly want a proper response take the time to get a proper translation of your request into Chinese (assuming that Mary is a native Chinese speaker); the outcome might be the same you ended up with, but you would leave less doubt and it would not look like a &quot;fishing exercise&quot; on your part. You will not care and/or follow up since you a) know better and b) are resistant to proposals of other (at least in this forum), but this lack of you at least trying to do the right thing will demonstrate for on-lookers that all you care about is &quot;being right&quot; (by your own definition of right and potentially having the last word/posting.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p><p>P.S.: I am still waiting for your elucidation how your style makes this forum a better more informative place over in the other thread: &quot;As a gesture of good-will I would like to invite you to give a however detailed description why you believe that the style of postings discussed i this thread actually improves the forum for all members, old and new.

					<p>Hey, first post!</p><p>I have an HT-TM05, hate the firmware, want to make OpenWRT mainline for it, and have a decently equipped electronics lab, and some Linux experience...</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>means hootoo original software? if so, i need your help please!</p></blockquote></div><p>If you want to go back to the original HooToo firmware, I think you need help that <em>I&#039;m unable to give</em>. I know a guy, though, and you should give him a call talk it through. He did wonders helping my sister with her mental illness.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m joking with that statement either... I&#039;m not impressed HooToo&#039;s firmware. It&#039;s so buggy and unstable... </p><p>Still, after reading this topic, it seems my best path forward is to break out the spudgers, solder on some headers and attach a serial adapter... &#039;cuz that way I can poke around to my heart&#039;s content with the stock firmware.</p><p>Let&#039;s figure out how to get the stock firmware onto your HT05. Let me know what information you think will be helpful. I imagine simple mtd_read dumps from the various mtd blocks isn&#039;t going to cut it, or you&#039;d be done by now.</p><p>So I&#039;ll refrain from refreshing my device until either you get your device back to the HooToo firmware, or I lose patience. I have a working MobileLite G2, so there&#039;s no rush on my side.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Is there somebody able to build a better version from the gl-inet sources with the imagebuilder found on that site ?</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;m going to try building a better version, but I&#039;m as likely to make a &quot;stock&quot; OpenWRT image as I am to make one base on gl-inet.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Has anyone managed to configure their HT-TM05 for a hotel context?&nbsp; Wireless LAN/Wireless WAN?&nbsp; I&#039;ve got it working with Wireless LAN/Ethernet WAN but my attempts at an all wireless setup have all met with disaster.</p></blockquote></div><p>Are you referring to the Stock firmware?&nbsp; If so, I&#039;ve managed to get it to work... <em>once</em>, and briefly. Never again.</p><p>The factory firmware isn&#039;t great: connected devices drop wifi randomly, and the TM05 reboots itself. </p><p>I&#039;m pretty sure minidlna is exhausting he TM05&#039;s memory when it does its periodic scan of attached storage. I see the same thing in OpenWRT on my MobileLite G2, which also has the MT7620N and 64 MiB of RAM.</p>									</div>

					<p>For those of you looking to build from sources for the HooToo TM-05, you can use the GL-MT300N builds.<br />I have done this, and the same builds for the GL-MT300N work on 2 devices that I&#039;ve been using:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- HooToo TM-05<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- RavPower RP-WD03</p><p>I use the Chaos-Calmer branch for these builds, and GL-inet has their own github repository for this:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc">https://github.com/domino-team/openwrt-cc</a></p><p>For building, I use linux ubuntu, and follow the directions in the openwrt wiki pages.&nbsp; &nbsp; Google on openwrt build or openwrt buildroot.&nbsp; &nbsp; Something like that.</p><p>Their code builds fine, with no errors.&nbsp; &nbsp; Takes awhile but builds.&nbsp; &nbsp; And then runs as expected.</p><p>If anyone is interested, I can publish my diffconfigs, and then I can also publish how I config the device once its up and running openwrt, by showing my files from /etc/config/</p><p>I spent quite a bit of time last night in reading through this thread from the beginning:&nbsp; GREAT Stuff, really enjoyed seeing what you guys have been doing, and can relate with some of the rat-holes you have to go down before finding a solution.</p><p>Lack of USB support and media streaming have seemed to be a sore spot for some folks, and largely due to the fact the the binary openwrt image from GL-inet doesn&#039;t have much in the way of USB.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This can all be added in with building from the Github sources.</p><p>Wingspinner has some info about the options that he builds with, which includes USB support.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I did have 1 build (there have been many) in which I enabled all the USB stuff, so I can confirm that it indeed does work.&nbsp; &nbsp; Didn&#039;t ever try out streaming stuff (dlna), so don&#039;t know about that.</p><p>Search on:&nbsp; wingspinner github<br />And read up on some of the stuff he&#039;s done.&nbsp; &nbsp; You can find links to forum posts and other amazing stuff.</p><p>Be glad to answer questions and help out where I can</p>									</div>
