					<p>Hi all.<br />Maybe I&#039;m dumb, but I cannot find the exact information about the TFTP installation procedure for a WRT610Nv1.<br />It&#039;s not clear to me whether the box is a TFTP client or a server!<br />If the info is somewhere here, please, just post the link, not the answer!<br />TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>i googled a bit for it, seems like dd-wrt has some infos about it. seems like it runs a tftp server for about 3 seconds after power-on, sending small firmware files (&lt;4 MB) should work in that time. also ping 192.168.1.1 should work during that time. the following seems to work:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>C:\Work&gt;tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT dd-wrt.v24_mini_generic.bin

					<p>The point, MBS, is that a fresh new (&quot;factory&quot;) OpenWRT build weights to 7+ MB because of the blank file system image.<br />So the TFTP is useless, unless someone builds a 4- MB initial image... :-(<br />I am wondering whether I can upload OpenWRT on top of DD-WRT. Any hint?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uqbar</strong> on 21 Mar 2012, 09:00)</p>

					<p>It is quite common that the openwrt factory build fills the entire flash chip, afaik that is not a problem for tftp install.</p><p>The generic instructions probably apply for wrt610. Have you tried starting the router into failsafe while pinging it?</p>									</div>
