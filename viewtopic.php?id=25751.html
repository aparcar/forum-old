					<p>IF anyone could please help with this i would be eternally grateful.&nbsp; I am a little new to openwrt and was kinda rushed into installing this as i needed a better firewall rule system than the stock Linksys would allow.</p><p>So I installed kamikaze a few months back with LuCI and a few other addons from the components section.&nbsp; Then i recently noticed that 10.03 was available and during some down time in the season decided to upgrade the firmware.&nbsp; </p><p>I simply reflashed the firmware with the existing components and configuration on the router. When I tried to access the router through the web interface it pulled back the Luci page and everything seemed to be ok, but after trying to pullback a webpage nothing seemed to work.&nbsp; I continued to verify all settings for internet and routing, everything was in order.</p><p>In an attempt to get the router working again I tried to reflash the firmware back down to kamikaze. It took the file and the checksum came back correct, the system went through the flash phase and I waited about 15 minutes to make sure. Then i tried relogging back in and nothing seemed to work, a ping of the router pulls back that the ip address is properly assigned and it does not timeout.&nbsp; </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am not very good with command line but if need be i can kinda stumble through.</p>									</div>
