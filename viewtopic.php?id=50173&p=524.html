From your last post I decided I would leave wireless down to see how it behaved. It ran for a few hours with no issues, so I setup the /etc/config/wireless file and brought wireless up. Started connecting wireless devices and all went well until the one fruit device in the house, and it all came tumbling down. I can&#039;t say for sure it was the ipad2 on ac, it&#039;s the only ac device I have, but that is when things went South. When I get a chance I will pull the mamba and connect it to serial to see if I can get anything of value from the console. Another point of interest, @idle cpu numbers are in the 1-4% range with this image, of course sans wireless. Now, where did I put that snake hook.</p></blockquote></div><p>So it looks like there is an issue with the latest mwlwifi (Mamba / fruit device / AC). If downgrading &quot;fixes&quot; it you have a very nice example (like from a school book) for looking into git-bisect if you aren&#039;t familiar with it already. You can do the bisect without the serial log but you will eventually want it anyway.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>lifehacksback wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>When will OpenWRT/LEDE push towards the use of nftables over iptables?</p></blockquote></div><p>Haven&#039;t seen any efforts in that direction yet, anyway, if you seek an answer better ask the mailing list.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi JW0914</p><p>As I don&#039;t even own a linksys router I feel out of place here and also I don&#039;t think its appropriate to discuss security in this thread.

But saying a password protected ssh server is &quot;massively insecure&quot; is only true if you use a dictionary word for a password (and the server is exposed on WAN, context). So again, I disagree with your statement. And yet again I repeat, I am talking about mounting a file system in ones own LAN. There&#039;s no exposure to outside world. Did you want me to suggest to the user to generate a public key and copy it over, then protect it with passphrase ...etc. That is grossly overdone and completely unjustified.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>JW0914 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1: &quot;Wouldn&#039;t an SSHFS mount be slower than a Samba or NFS mount?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2: &quot;Performance degradation if one configures it with a 2048bit SSH key, not to mention wholly unnecessary on a LAN.&quot; [in comparison to Samba or NFS]</p></blockquote></div><p>1. Indeed it is slower, on my box (which has no crypto hw) I get 10MByte consistent speeds when transferring from my HDD, thats enough for me to stream HD content with absolutely no buffering. SSHFS is designed to be user controlled (not root), notice if you use sshfs jw@router_IP /home/jw/mntpoint then you wont need to provide root password, sshfs is designed with the end user in mind, not quite like how you described it (ie tool for sysadmins for maintenance..etc etc). </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The openssl benchmarks aren&#039;t with SSHFS, or at least none that I could find via searching this thread via google, or searching this site&#039;s index for *sshfs*, or *sshfs* AND *openssl*</p></blockquote></div><p>sshfs uses openssh-sftp-server, which uses openssl for crypto, which would utilize a crypto hw engine if available.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>JW0914 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>A LAN SSHFS creates more problems than it solves on OpenWrt... by no means take my word for it, take the NAS industry&#039;s.&nbsp; When has anyone seen FreeNAS/TrueNAS offer SSHFS for LAN shares?</p></blockquote></div><p>But of course they wouldn&#039;t dear, those &quot;NAS industry&quot; companies need to cater for the masses, ie the windows customers. Our friend Wayne however is using linux on his laptop, sshfs is precisely designed for this purpose, mount a user&#039;s files on a remote host. Linux protocols, running on Linux hosts. No samba or stuff with windows heritage.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>JW0914 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>SSHFS utilizes SFTP, but directly exposes the remote filesystem to the client device, allowing access not through a single terminal or sandboxed application, but from anything running on the client device.</p></blockquote></div><p>Again, my mount command was sshfs root@/his/usb/stick/path /his/local/path<br />it will only &quot;expose&quot; his usb stick. Whats massively insecure about this?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>JW0914 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The main point I&#039;m making is it&#039;s ill-advised to utilize SSHFS as root due to the security risk, along with better existing tools for LAN shares on OpenWrt.</p></blockquote></div><p>I guess we can agree to disagree then? If a user asked me now how do I access my USB stick/hdd connected to router, I&#039;d still say sshfs. The better tools you mention are windows designed tools, so for a windows user you are right, for wayne sshfs is native.<br />Openwrt runs everything as root, including samba. That seems to be a &quot;massive security&quot; risk, doesn&#039;t it? What I&#039;m trying to get across is you must look at context, where is the software running?, for what purpose?, don&#039;t just dismiss a solution completely. I hope you see the big picture. I will not argue further on whats better. As they say, to each his own.<br />You have a good one. Cheers all.</p>									</div>
