So click ixp4xx_generic.</p><p>That brings you to another list, which is (mostly) a list of files. Typically, there is one specifically built for each kind of router, but since there isn&#039;t, we go with the generic one (openwrt-ixp4xx-generic-squashfs.img and openwrt-ixp4xx-generic-zImage) Click each file on that page to download.</p>									</div>
