					<p>In a project of mine on the Uni, I&#039;m working with an AT91RM9200 (devboard like) and a Micron CMOS camera modult. This module is capable of 2Mpix with HW JPEG compression, streamed out on an 8-bit parralel databus, with 3 bits of control line.</p><p>The 9200&#039;s now running Debian, but I&#039;m thinking hard to change it to wrt. This is where, the main part comes in. I&#039;ve to develop the driver (and the SW) for the camera, but the easies way will be to use one line of IRQ. On the RM9200&#039;s the IRQ0 is free (other IRQ inputs used by other peripherial like LAN PHY), but I did not now, what will happen, if I connect to that port and ask the kernel to reserve the IRQ0 for me. Can anyone help me solve this matter?</p><p>BTW, how does OpenWRT handle IRQ&#039;s?</p>									</div>
