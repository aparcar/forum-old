					<p>Hello to everyone in the meantime I wanted to thank you for the forum and the support and the excellent firmware that I use with pleasure. But I wanted to ask you something about the mini-router ASUS WL-330N3G and its USB port. You can use OpenWRT with the USB port to connect a webcam? And as in the case? It would really be the ultimate. </p><p>Thank you for your help;)</p>									</div>

					<p>That depends on your purposes. If you happen to run out of space while installing packages, you might try to build a custom firmware image only containing the packages you need. Also, packages put into the firmware image are compressed stronger than those installed later (since squashfs has better compression than jffs2).</p>									</div>
