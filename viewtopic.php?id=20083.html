					<p>Community,</p><p>I&#039;m currently cooking Piranha 2 and I have some open questions regarding buildroot:</p><p>1. One can place custom files (e.g. scripts) into trunk/files/usr/bin to appear in the jffs2 at /usr/bin. I&#039;m wondering if the execution flags will be preserved in the jffs2 if I chmod 755 a certain script in trunk/files subdirectory.</p><p>2. Let&#039;s assume I&#039;d like to setup a custom repository with some ipks. Let&#039;s assume stock OpenWrt provides aircrack-ng r1142 in the official 8.09 repo and I put, let&#039;s say, r1396 into my custom repo at klashed.net and define both repos in a custom /etc/opkg.conf. Is opkg smart enough to install the higher revision from klashed.net if I issue opkg install aircrack-ng? I.e. does it install r1396 instead of r1142 automatically due to the higher revision number as apt-get would do?</p><p>3. Another opkg related thing: Let&#039;s assume I have a certain Makefile and I define some depends in there. Furthermore I define not to introduce the resulting ipks (the tool + dependencies) into the jffs2 but to build them as plain ipks. Now, let&#039;s assume I put these ipks into a repo, define this in /etc/opkg.conf and issue opkg install somepackage. Does opkg resolve the dependencies I defined in the Makefile automatically? I mean does it install e.g. libpthread when installing aircrack-ng? I know opkg has this capaility but I&#039;m wondering if the depend definition in the Makefile is enough for opkg to know that a certain package depends on something else.</p><p>4. Is there a smart way to introduce an already compiled ipk to the jffs2 using buildroot? I mean, let&#039;s assume I don&#039;t have the sources for that ipk and/or no Makefile is available but the compiled ipk. Is there a smarter way then extracting the ipk and place everthing inside the tarball in subdirectories of trunk/files? </p><p>There&#039;s certainly some more to come, but that&#039;s what I&#039;m wondering about currently.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your support,<br />orange</p>									</div>

					<p>One more thing:</p><p>5. Let&#039;s assume I have a set of scripts, I put them into trunk/files subdirectories for the inclusion into the jffs2. Now let&#039;s assume these scripts needs a bunch of dependencies for proper operation out of OpenWrt&#039;s package tree and I&#039;d like to avoid to select them all manually in make menuconfig. If the set of scripts would be based on some sources available somewhere I could write a Makefile for them and introduce all dependencies in there - problem solved, BUT... what if these scripts itself do not require any compilation at all? Does buildroot support kinda &quot;metapackages&quot; that just takes care of dependency resolution?</p><p>best,<br />orange</p>									</div>
