Do you want to build and run OpenWRT on EA6100? Or do you want to build Linksys&#039; own firmware and use it? Who and where is &quot;their website&quot;?</p><p>If you mean the former, then the answer is &quot;Probably&quot;. According to the Table of Hardware, a revision of trunk already supports the Linksys EA6300 v1 variant. See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/linksys/linksys_ea6300_v1">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/lin â€¦ _ea6300_v1</a></p><p>Depending on what the hardware differences are between the EA6100 and EA6300, it might be possible to use the EA6300 as a baseline and port it to work on the EA6100. You would need to wrap your sleeves and do the work yourself, though.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I was looking on the wiki on compiling openwrt but it didn&#039;t mention whether I can use the source code firmware provided to make openwrt. Or at least I completely misread it.</p></blockquote></div><p>You can use the source code provided by the OpenWRT project to build yourself a firmware image, as long as you adhere to the license restrictions applied by the GNU General Public License v2 (<a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob/master/LICENSE">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob/master/LICENSE</a>). </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>On a side note i noticed that openwrt has support for the MT7620A chipset found in the Xiaomi MI wifi mini which is similar to that found on this router.

It might not be easy, simple or effortless, and you might face obstacles, learn new things, get frustrated, brick a few routers, break a few circuits and smoke a lot of cigarettes (if that&#039;s your vice). But it can be done <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

I just wanted to know what source code you mean, so that I have reference point.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Raisins4u wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>On the ea6100. Maybe I&#039;m confused but is it not possible to copy the source code for the firmware and build an openwrt image with its front end?</p></blockquote></div><p>I believe you have confused something now. OpenWRT is a complete system by itself, containing possible bootloaders, kernel, and lots of packages providing different functionality. There&#039;s even the LuCI package which provides the defaut web front end. If you build an &quot;OpenWRT image&quot;, you usually get the whole lot. Of course you can customize the package to your heart&#039;s content.</p><p>I took a peek inside the Linksys source code package, and the source code is comprised of original source code of the packages, paired with a collection of patches to make it work on their target platform. The toolchain seems to be a Marvell ARMv7 cross-compilation toolchain.</p><p>From this point of view, OpenWRT and the Linksys source package follow similar philosophies. </p><p>You might want to look inside the router and identify the exact system-on-a-chip that is used. It might be a pretty simple process to get OpenWRT running on your router. See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.marvell">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.marvell</a> for details on which Marvell SoCs are currently supported. From the target menu of OpenWRT&#039;s Chaos Calmer branch,, I found Marvell Armada 37x/38x/XP and Marvell Kirkwood targets. If your router has any of these SoCs, then your job just got a whole lot easier. All you need is build the default profile of the suitable target and attempt to run it on your router to see if it works.</p><p>As for the Linksys front-end, you can certainly extract the package that comprises the front-end from the Linksys sources, and create a new OpenWRT package with this source code, together with a set of patches to modify the sources so that they can properly use OpenWRT&#039;s UCI system to read and write settings. You would essentially build a replacement package for LuCI.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Raisins4u wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Also the ea6300 uses a Broadcom chip unfortunately so I don&#039;t think it would be possible with my router.</p></blockquote></div><p>Then you cannot use those sources.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Raisins4u wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Where would I start porting? Is there an easier way without risking completely bricking my router?</p></blockquote></div><p>Start by identifying the SoC on the router, then getting an OpenWRT build environment running in a virtual machine (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildvm">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildvm</a>) and see if there&#039;s already a suitable target that you can exploit. Who knows, maybe you get lucky?</p>									</div>
