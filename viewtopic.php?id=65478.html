					<p>I&#039;m currently using my TP-Link Archer C7 v2 as a switch and an AP, I also have another unmanaged 8-port switch that connects to the Archer, my router is a self-built pfSense box. I would like to have OpenWRT do QoS/Traffic Shaping at the application level since I will have a lot of data flying around. I have a server which runs 3 KVMs (Web Server, Usenet/Torrent Downloader, test VM), along with a self-built Steam Machine which I will use to stream HD games from my bedroom to the Nvidia Shield in my living room. </p><p>I would like to make all the data from the nvidia ports (I&#039;ll find them later, there&#039;s a bunch of them) from my pc highest priority, then SMB next highest priority (streaming HD movies from the server to Kodi on the Shield) and the downloads from my server lowest priority.</p><p>I found <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/packet.scheduler/packet.scheduler">this wiki page</a>, but it seems a little complex and I was wondering if there was a simpler way to do it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cool thanks for the info, I should clarify that I only intend on doing QoS for the devices connected to the Archer which would just be the Shield, Steam Machine, then anything coming from or going to the unmanaged switch.</p>									</div>
