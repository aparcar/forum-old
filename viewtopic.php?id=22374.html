					<p>Hello all, </p><p>I&#039;ve bought this router in order to use it with a HUAWEI E1962 Usb modem. The problem is that it does not work. From what I&#039;ve seen it is firmware settings issue. <br />Another problem is that I can control the router only from the web interface, wich is pretty empty of options. </p><p>I tried to find out what are the hardware capabilites (ram, flash size, ram size, chipset, etc) in order to see if it is compatible with Opent-wrt/ddwrt but I found out only the speed of the processor (240MHz). The rest is fuzzy. It might have 4MB of flash and 16MB of memory. I would like to find out these variables and then maybe I will try to install a third party firmware. <br />I tried to search information on FCC Gov site, but nothing clear. </p><p>There might be 2 options: open the box and void waranty or th access the console. By default the console is unavailable for me.</p><p>I&#039;ve run nmap to see what ports are available, maybe i&#039;ll start from here Smile. Here is the result:</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>nmap -vrAT5OsVp1-65535sU 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Starting Nmap 5.00 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2009-11-01 12:51 CET<br />NSE: Loaded 30 scripts for scanning.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Initiating ARP Ping Scan at 12:51&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Scanning 192.168.2.1 [1 port]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Completed ARP Ping Scan at 12:51, 0.02s elapsed (1 total hosts)<br />Initiating Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 12:51&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Completed Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 12:51, 0.00s elapsed<br />Initiating SYN Stealth Scan at 12:51&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Scanning smc33n.smc.com (192.168.2.1) [1000 ports]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Discovered open port 23/tcp on 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Discovered open port 53/tcp on 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Discovered open port 80/tcp on 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Discovered open port 2601/tcp on 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Discovered open port 2602/tcp on 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Discovered open port 52869/tcp on 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Completed SYN Stealth Scan at 12:51, 0.59s elapsed (1000 total ports)<br />Initiating Service scan at 12:51&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Scanning 6 services on smc33n.smc.com (192.168.2.1)<br />Completed Service scan at 12:51, 11.03s elapsed (6 services on 1 host)<br />Initiating OS detection (try #1) against smc33n.smc.com (192.168.2.1)<br />NSE: Script scanning 192.168.2.1.<br />NSE: Starting runlevel 1 scan<br />Initiating NSE at 12:51<br />Completed NSE at 12:51, 4.01s elapsed<br />NSE: Script Scanning completed.<br />Host smc11n.smc.com (192.168.2.1) is up (0.0067s latency).<br />Interesting ports on smc33n.smc.com (192.168.2.1):<br />Not shown: 994 closed ports<br />PORT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STATE SERVICE VERSION<br />23/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; open&nbsp; telnet&nbsp; NASLite-SMB/Sveasoft Alchemy firmware telnetd<br />53/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; open&nbsp; domain&nbsp; dnsmasq 2.24<br />80/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; open&nbsp; http&nbsp; &nbsp; Mini_httpd 1.19<br />|_ html-title: 802.11n Router<br />2601/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; zebra&nbsp; &nbsp;Quagga routing software<br />2602/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; zebra&nbsp; &nbsp;Quagga routing software<br />52869/tcp open&nbsp; http&nbsp; &nbsp; Intel UPnP reference SDK httpd 1.2 (UPnP 1.0, platform Linux 2.6.17)<br />|_ html-title: Site doesn&#039;t have a title (text/html).<br />MAC Address: 00:12:CF:D4:D2:10 (Accton Technology)<br />Device type: general purpose<br />Running: Linux 2.6.X<br />OS details: Linux 2.6.9 - 2.6.28<br />Uptime guess: 0.199 days (since Sun Nov&nbsp; 1 08:05:28 2009)<br />Network Distance: 1 hop<br />TCP Sequence Prediction: Difficulty=203 (Good luck!)<br />IP ID Sequence Generation: All zeros</p><p>Read data files from: /usr/share/nmap<br />OS and Service detection performed.

I don&#039;t pretty much stuff about this, but i am learning .. or at least willing to learn Smile.</p><p>Also I tried to run telnet on the 23 port and it asks me for a username and a password. I tried the user from web interface but it does not work. In router&#039;s logs I see root user. I am guessing that the OS credentials are separate.</p><p>The firmware is the latest: 1.0.5... something like this, and from what i&#039;ve seen in the SMC site there is also available the source code for that firmware.</p><p>So, I kindly ask anyone to provide me some help. <br />BR</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bobeid</strong> on 1 Nov 2009, 14:12)</p>
