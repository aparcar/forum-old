					<p>A little UP for these incredible packages.<br />I&#039;ve tried sc2mpd with <a href="https://www.linn.co.uk/software#songcast">songcast client</a> on raspberry, the latency is very low so you can stream the sound of a movie with a good synchronization between image and sound.<br />Please take a look to it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
