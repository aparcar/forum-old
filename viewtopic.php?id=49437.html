					<p>Bit of an odd question, my daughter has a routine at bedtime that she gets to watch a netflix cartoon on the iPad until it&#039;s time to go to bed. What I would like to do is set a hard shutdown of wifi service on one channel or even better just one MAC address. Then I can manually switch the iPad to another channel or enter a new password to continue if I like. I imagine&nbsp; there&#039;s an app for that but I&#039;d like to be able to have this wifi control as she gets older. Routine is very important for her as she is mildly autistic. It&#039;s easier if the routine is hard set as opposed to&nbsp; just me making the decision it&#039;s bedtime.&nbsp; I am using the latest openwrt on a tplink n750 router. </p><p>Short&nbsp; of installing software on each device which is likely the easiest answer, any idea if a script is possible in the router for this?</p><p>Ian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thislilfishy</strong> on 11 Mar 2014, 02:12)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Setting up or down the wifi thing might be a bit tricky, since as far as I know you cannot simply throw some commands against the wifi interface and make it behave in any way. You need (or at least: Should, everything else leads to a situation where in a couple of months nobody knows how your configuration is supposed to work) adjust the wifi configuration in /etc/config/wireless and make the whole wifi module reload. That&#039;s obviously not meant to be done automatically on a scheduled basis.</p><p>You could have a look at this one:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#rules">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#rules</a></p><p>Firewall rules can have a start and end time.</p><p>My suggestion:<br />* Create a dedicated wifi for your daughter<br />* Give it a dedicated vlan, including its own IP range provided by its own DHCP setting<br />* This pretty much equals some &quot;guest wifi&quot; setting, like <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">this one</a></p><p>Now you can:<br />* Add a firewall rule that restricts your daughters wifi to the time frame you decide<br />* Connect your personal devices to the general, already existing wifi<br />* Simply switch between different wifis when you want to use your daughters ipad yourself</p><p>That clearly needs some enhanced configuration, but it&#039;s completely according to several &quot;best practice&quot; or &quot;how to&quot; documents on the wiki, and on the other side, it is completely reflected by LuCI. Although not everything can be adjusted right inside LuCI (times of firewall), they *are* exposed in LuCI. So nearly nothing untraceable happens. That&#039;s the most important thing for me when setting up such a thing: It should contain close to no hidden fancy mechanisms that need to be known even in a couple of years in order to understand what&#039;s going on. Only this prevents you from hard-resetting your router and reconfiguring it just because &quot;the hell, what&#039;s going on there&quot; situations <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 11 Mar 2014, 02:38)</p>

					<p>Thank you, it&#039;s funny I even thought of the idea. I was talking to a friend that turns the router off at night to ensure his teen kids aren&#039;t up all night playing games and such. I figured an easier solution (other then better parenting LOLs) is to set up a time schedule in the router. My router has two SSID&#039;s which I don&#039;t broadcast. I set static ips, so your solution is sort of what I had in mine. My wife and I have our devices on ssid 1 and the iPad is the only thing on the other ssid. I never thought of firewall rules, I just figured perhaps I could script a MAC address out at certain times, setting the firewall permissions is far simpler, basing this on times will require some research on my side. I only have a few devices on wifi as I wired the house with cat6 for gig transfers from my NAS drives and ip cameras (I work in security and access control) so only phones, my daughters iPad and a printer. I set the iPad on the 5mhz band and left everything else on the 2.5Mhz band, so I accidentally pre planned this.</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>
