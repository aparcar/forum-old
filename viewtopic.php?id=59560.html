					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>because of some reasons I want to route my whole internet traffic over OpenVPN. For this purpose, I have a server in a datacenter, but currently I only make ~20 Mbit/s with my TP-Link 1043ND v2.</p><p>Is there a router, which is recommendable for using OpenVPN with at least 50 Mbit/s? The bottleneck is currently my router, because using the VPN with my desktop brings about 50 Mbit/s or more. Important for me is Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi is not so important, because of an external access point.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you should be very happy with that performance.&nbsp; It&#039;s a 720Mhz CPU, which is about as fast as a consumer router will run.&nbsp; It&#039;s 1.5 to 2 times as fast as my PC-engines ALIX.&nbsp; </p><p>Check the TOH for faster processors: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_supported?datasrt=cpu%20mhz">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_e … =cpu%20mhz</a><br />The&nbsp; link is to the SUPPORTED devices, but you should all check ALL, as the TOH is new and not fully updated.</p><p>The bottleneck for OpenVPN is encryption speed.&nbsp; The faster the processor generally the better the performance.&nbsp; You probably want a CPU that performs hardware encryption, as opposed to software encryption, which I expect the TP-Link does.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely to push you to using a X86 variant on a PC or embedded system.&nbsp; </p><p>PC-Engines makes an APU, which has a 1000MHZ dual core CPU, and up to 4GB of memory but this does not have hardware AES, and I have not seen any performance data for VPN.&nbsp; It would run a 64bit x86 version which you would probably want to build.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/pcengines/apu">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/pcengines/apu</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/pcengines/pcengines_apu1c4">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/pcen … nes_apu1c4</a><br /><a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm">http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm</a></p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/x86/64/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … 05/x86/64/</a></p>									</div>
