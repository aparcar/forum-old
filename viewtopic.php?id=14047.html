					<p>I&#039;ve just moved house (and broadband provider) and in the process seem to have lost connectivity to my WL-500g. Since putting Kamikaze onto the router I&#039;d been unable to use the wired ports and relied upon a wireless connection to my DSL router.</p><p>The router appears to boot successfully (going by the lights), but I cannot seem to connect to it at all - is there any way to &#039;force&#039; a connection via the wired ports ?&nbsp; The router was running with a fixed (internal) IP address and it would appear that it&#039;s not acting as a DHCP server. I tried using &quot;arp -s&quot; to map it&#039;s MAC address to what I believe it&#039;s IP address to be, but no luck as yet in connecting and getting it to talk to me.</p><p>It may be that I need to go back to basics and reflash - if I do so any chance I could just stick my USB drive back in and have all the settings/config I had before ?</p>									</div>
