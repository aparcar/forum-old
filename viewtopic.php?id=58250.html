					<p>Hello all! :-)</p><p>Ok, first of all here is what I&#039;m using. The device in question is a TPLINK (1.6) TL-WR703N device. I&#039;ve successfully flashed it with the latest recommended OpenWRT image for this device (&quot;barrier breaker, 14.07&quot;). No problem there -- the device works, I can get into luci and set options.</p><p>Though what I&#039;m trying to do with this router I guess is <em>slightly</em> odd as I&#039;m trying to do these two things at exactly the same time (not sure if it is possible). The first is to act as some sort of wifi to wired bridge (for computers that have no built-in wifi); the second, to be able to access (with, for example a USB memory stick connected to the WR703N) files from a usb memory stick from the wifi on the WR703N itself on another machine.</p><p>The first bit - acting aas a bridge - seemed to be pretty easy as by and large I&#039;ve found openwrt just already seems to do this. In fact I&#039;m sitting here right now looking at the older laptop with the WR703N plugged in running openwrt and I can use the &#039;net and access the luci interface as well.</p><p>The problem is the next bit -- getting the contents of a usb memory stick seen and exposed to another machine via either ftp or some sort of simple webserver. </p><p>I&#039;m connecting to the internet btw via another router; that router itself is the &quot;main&quot; router through which all my machines connect to the internet through. I use static IP addresses as well (no DHCP). The &quot;main&quot; router&#039;s IP address btw is set to 192.168.0.1 . Here&#039;s what I have set on the WR703N btw;</p><p>LAN-<br />Address=192.168.0.24<br />Netmask=255.255.255.0</p><p>WIFI-<br />address=192.168.0.25<br />Netmask=255.255.255.0<br />Gateway=192.168.0.1</p><p>The strange thing is that I can use the WR703N right now just fine as a bridge -- I can connect to the &#039;net and ping websites with no problem. On the machine which the WR703N is connected to (via an ethernet cable; the machine has no wifi itself) I can ping IP address 192.168.0.24, but not 192.168.0.25 .&nbsp; Also 192.168.0.1 fails to ping as well (which is weird, as I&#039;d have thought if that IP address can&#039;t be seen the internet wouldn&#039;t work at all. There is no sign of 192.168.0.25 at all on any other machine.</p><p>Can anyone think if I&#039;ve missed something at all?</p><p>thanks</p><p>ljones</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ljones</strong> on 29 Jun 2015, 23:23)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Did you really *bridge*? Then you shouldn&#039;t have a LAN and a wifi interface up. </p><p>When having both, the wifi and the LAN interface inside of 192.168.0.0/24, then you&#039;re telling your device: The network 192.168.0.0/24 is on both lanes, so pick any lane, both are equal. That&#039;s certainly not true.</p><p>Could you please give us the content of your /etc/config/network in detail? I guess your eth0 interface is part of both, a bridge interface (in conjunction with wifi) on one hand and a single non-bridged interface on the other hand.</p><p>What about the 192.168.0.24 address? Can you reach it from one of your computers not being wired to the LAN port of your WR703N? If that&#039;s the case then simply your 192.168.0.25 interface is superfluous <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to use &#039;relayd&#039; to make a full bridge where everything on both sides of the wifi AP-client link appears to be in the same LAN.</p><p>Right now you probably have the wifi client in the WAN so the 703 is routing twice, making it impossible to reach back to users connected to the main router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Had another go at all of this experimenting just a little :-) . Got just a little way further. BTW you can once again see the <a href="http://slothpuck.no-ip.org/openwrt/2.jpg">interfaces</a> screen here.</p><p>What works?<br />-&nbsp; I can see the internet from the WR703N no problem<br />- I&#039;m using two IP addresses, 192.168.0.24 for the lan;&nbsp; 192.168.0.25 for the wifi<br />- The lan is actually using &quot;br-lan&quot; which I am guessing is the bridge between the two (I note the icon shows this too on the interfaces page)</p><p>What doesen&#039;t?<br />- Can&#039;t see 192.168.0.24 outside of the WR703N. </p><p>Here&#039;s a thought. Guessing slightly here and although I do have one (though it isn&#039;t working anymore) you can buy wireless to wifi bridges (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onumVq27f5o">eg vonets</a>) online, for example off ebay (though they don&#039;t really have any other function beyond this). Thinking here that when you go to set them up the actual (vonets) bridge never really has an IP address per se. So should I be replicating something like this with openwrt; should I put everything on the WWAN side and the LAN dosen&#039;t &quot;have&quot; an IP address if you an see what I mean?</p><p>Anyways in the meantime again here&#039;s my config files;</p><p>/etc/config/network;<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>
