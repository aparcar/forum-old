					<p>Hey everyone...</p><p>I was just wondering if anyone knows how to boot the device from the ethernet w/o having to actually burn the flash?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been playing with the WRT54g for a few days and it would be much nicer if it didn&#039;t save the image to flash each time.&nbsp; So, if I totally hose the image - i just reboot and it&#039;s back to factory flash.</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Rob</p>									</div>
