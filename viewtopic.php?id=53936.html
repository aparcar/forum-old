					<p>Hey team! Has anyone attempted loading OpenWrt on a TP-Link Archer D9?<br />At this point I can&#039;t even work out how to flash it with the firmware (since it rejects it in the OEM web utility). Attempts to halt the normal boot process by pushing/holding random buttons to allow a TFTP transfer have not been successful (not sure if it is client or server, or if it even allows TFTP transfers for firmware). Thoughts on how it might be done?</p><p>I have put the details I know about it here: <a href="https://bc.whirlpool.net.au/bc/hardware/?action=h_view&amp;model_id=1560">https://bc.whirlpool.net.au/bc/hardware … el_id=1560</a><br />I will create a hardware page in the OpenWrt table of hardware also. I have just now finished pulling the router apart, taking photos, and putting back together again. Will post them in time also.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi woodsb02<br />Did you work out how to do it?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking at trying it only because I dislike the TP-Link web UI, O + I like to use open stuff.&nbsp; From what I can see from web searching, there doesn&#039;t appear to be any other firmware for the Archer D9 except the original i.e. no Tomato, DD-WRT etc</p>									</div>

					<p>From recent threads on this forum, I believe TP-Link have locked the firmware on this model and therefore openwrt cannot currently run.</p><p>Disappointing.</p><p>However the latest firmware does allow shell access (ash).</p><p>~ # cat /proc/version<br />Linux version 2.6.36.4brcmarm (root@localhost.localdomain) (gcc version 4.5.3 (Buildroot 2012.02) ) #113 SM PREEMPT Wed Aug 26 11:26:41 HKT 2015</p><p>Also this router has a usb port which allows me to iptables-save the current filtering rules and replace them.</p><p>Am I correct that openwrt can&#039;t be run here?</p>									</div>
