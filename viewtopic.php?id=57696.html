					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get Wifi with N speed to work on my Linksys WRT320N, but i seem to be having some troubles getting above Wifi G speeds.</p><p>My /etc/config/wireless looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;
        option type &#039;mac80211&#039;
        option path &#039;bcma0:1&#039;
        option txpower &#039;20&#039;
        option country &#039;NL&#039;
        option channel &#039;11&#039;
        option noscan &#039;1&#039;
        option hwmode &#039;11g&#039;

config wifi-iface
        option device &#039;radio0&#039;
        option network &#039;lan&#039;
        option mode &#039;ap&#039;
        option ssid &#039;OpenWRT&#039;
        option key &#039;**********&#039;
        option encryption &#039;psk2+ccmp&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The above config is a mixture from results i found on these forums and the OpenWRT wiki. The net result is wigi g with 54 mbit/s (that is if i&#039;m lucky and basically sitting on top of the router). I tried setting htmode to HT40- but that apparently completely disables my wifi.</p><p>I&#039;m sure Wifi N speeds are possible on this router, i must be missing some obvious setting somewhere?</p><p>Also, the radio0 is displayed as b/g radio in the OpenWRT web admin. Why is that? It&#039;s most certainly N capable.</p><p>The firmware version i&#039;m using:<br />OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05-rc1 / LuCI Master (git-15.126.50380-7a54785)</p><p>I hope someone can help me solving this issue?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>Zajec, it would be nice if you could be a little more elaborate instead of just pointing me to links as hints..</p><p>Anyway, the first link was the hint i needed to get this to work. And to help others out that might have the same issue, i will describe what i did to get it working.</p><p>First is installed the following packages: kmod-brcm-wl wl wlc nas<br />Then i disabled the b43 driver in /etc/modules.d/b43 (just remove the line in that file or put a # before it.<br />Then i copied the sample wireless config to /etc/config/wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;wl0&#039;
    option type &#039;broadcom&#039;
    option disabled &#039;0&#039;
    option channel &#039;4&#039;
    option txpower &#039;16&#039;

config wifi-iface
    option device &#039;wl0&#039;
    option network &#039;lan&#039;
    option ssid &#039;OpenWrt&#039;
    option key &#039;passphrase&#039;
    option mode &#039;ap&#039;
    option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;</code></pre></div><p>followed by the following commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# wl -i wl0 chanspec -c 9 -b 2 -w 40 -s 1
root@OpenWrt:~# wl -i wl0 down
root@OpenWrt:~# wl -i wl0 up</code></pre></div><p>At that point i just rebooted. Just to be sure that the right modules would be loaded (and unloaded).</p><p>After a reboot i had a new wireless AP in my wifi list so i used the OpenWRT web interface to further change wifi settings as i deemed right. I now have a working wifi-n connection!
