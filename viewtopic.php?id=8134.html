					<p>Has anybody tried using Compex WP54-WRT? It recently supported Open-WRT as claimed on the website <a href="http://compex.com.sg/home/OEM/Open_wrt.htm">http://compex.com.sg/home/OEM/Open_wrt.htm</a>. I was looking for a Open-WRT AP and this looks like a good brand. I have been using Compex WP54 1B, therefore I would like to try this. Anybody has any ideas?</p>									</div>
