					<p>I don&#039;t have Internet at home, so I turn on the Wifi Tethering on my mobile as soon as I&#039;m home. Also, I have OpenWRT on my TP-Link (TL-WA701ND) to acting as a repeater for my mobile hotspot.</p><p>My problem is that each time I return home, my laptop cannot find the extended wifi. It seems that the interface goes down when it cannot connect to my mobile although I have the option disassoc_low_ack set to &#039;0&#039;.</p><p>I followed this <a href="http://lechacal.com/wiki/index.php/Repeat_a_Wifi_Hotspot">link</a> on how to setup the repeater.</p><p>Any idea how I can keep my setup stable and to reconnect as soon as it finds the main hotspot?</p>									</div>

					<p>Until the STA interface links up with its AP, any AP interfaces that are also run on the same radio will be off the air.&nbsp; That is a limitation of hostapd and the wifi driver.&nbsp; There are some third party scripts to work around this issue.</p>									</div>
