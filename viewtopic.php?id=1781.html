Poking at random pins to figure that out is a very good way to do some serious damage; your safest option is using a jtag cable.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All,</p><p>An amazing recovery...</p><p>I overclocked the WRT54G v2 without updating the PMON firmware using the clkfreq=216, commited and rebooted.

When applying power it started up and was able to unset the clkfreq value by executing mtd erase nvram.
