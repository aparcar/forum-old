					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have a WRT54GL (v1.1) running WhiteRussian and the x-wrt interface. I noticed under the Advanced Wireless tab that I could play with the power settings (antenna power?). By default it was set at 28mW and my Mac was detecting the signal strength to be around 62 or 63%(from a distance of 2meters). Testing higher power settings didn&#039;t increase the signal strength that much. The max strength I saw was 72% with 250mW power settings. Is this normal? Does anyone get better signal with this setup?</p><p>surroundings: there are around 5 or 6 other wireless networks around mine with good enough strength (between 50 and 63%) and I have a 2.4GHz motorola cordless phone (was not working when I was testing the power settings). The noise seems to be about 9% in the surroundings.</p><p>What would radio experts say about the signal I am getting? Is it around what I should expect or not?</p><p>Thanks for the wonderful openwrt firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply and clarification. I later remembered that increasing the power of the signal would also result in an increase in noise level too (Analog Comm 101). As for the heat output for increased power, I had anticipated that and put the router in front of the air conditioner just in case.</p>									</div>
