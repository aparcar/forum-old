					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to call a function in my controller from one of my views by using the XHR.poll method, and have the call return some uci data from my /etc/config/ configuration file.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m not successful, and can&#039;t really figure out what&#039;s going on.</p><p>Right now, the javascript in my view code looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>function myFunction() { 
    XHR.poll(5, &#039;&lt;%=luci.dispatcher.build_url(&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;call&quot;)%&gt;/&#039;, null, function(x, data) {
        alert(&quot;Data is &quot; + data);
    }); 
};</code></pre></div><p>My controller call looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>function action_my_function()
    local uci = luci.model.uci.cursor()

    luci.http.prepare_content(&quot;text/plain&quot;) 
    luci.http.write(uci:get(&quot;package&quot;, &quot;section&quot;, &quot;option&quot;))
end</code></pre></div><p>Also, here is my entry code, but I don&#039;t think the problem lies here at all:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    entry({&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;call&quot;}, call(&quot;action_my_function&quot;), nil).leaf = true</code></pre></div><p>I can see that the luci.http.write returns what I like (that is, the correct configuration option value in my configuration file) by navigating to &quot;http://NODE/cgi-bin/luci/admin/package/call&quot; in my browser, however, on the actual view page, if I set a breakpoint in my javascript code, Firebug tells me that my &quot;data&quot; variable is null.</p><p>I&#039;m sure I&#039;m doing something simple completely wrong, but I can&#039;t figure out what.&nbsp; Does anyone have any clue?&nbsp; Is there a more elegant way of doing what I want instead of using luci.http.write?&nbsp; Like, can I just use a &#039;return&#039; in the controller Lua code?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried this method before, but to no avail.</p><p>As always, thanks in advance for any insight.</p><p>--<br />Justyn</p>									</div>

					<p>I can figure it out that what you are doing. You may change this line :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>luci.http.write(uci:get(&quot;package&quot;, &quot;section&quot;, &quot;option&quot;))</code></pre></div><p>I look up in the reference that luci.http.write , the first argument is the name of the package, second is name of section and the&nbsp; third is name of option which is optional. Check this line. You offer just the strings.&nbsp; Check this line. And sometime the section is anonymous so take care of it.</p><p>I hope it will help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wandy</strong> on 11 Jun 2014, 05:52)</p>

					<p>Wandy,</p><p>Thanks for taking a look at the post.&nbsp; uci:get will return a string if the option exists, or nil if it does not.&nbsp; I&#039;ve verified that it does indeed return the (correct) string when invoked (by debug dumps, etc). luci.http.write takes a &quot;content chunk&quot; (whatever that means) and returns it to the client.&nbsp; If this is nil, luci.http.close is invoked.&nbsp; I can confirm that luci.http.write is being invoked by navigating to http://NODE/cgi-bin/luci/admin/package/call in my brower, however, it never makes it to the JavaScript code, which leads me to believe I&#039;m doing something wrong there, and not in the Lua namespace.</p><p>Albeit, I should refactor the code so that nil is handled better (instead of just passing it along), and I should look more into what a content chunk, and what a LTN12 Sink is.&nbsp; The examples I&#039;ve seen, however, show luci.http.write being invoked with a string literal as the parameter.&nbsp; It might not be that easy though.</p>									</div>

					<p>The &quot;data&quot; argument passed to the callback function is only defined if the response was of type &quot;application/json&quot; - in this case &quot;data&quot; holds the decoded JSON response readily accessible for JavaScript.</p><p>Since you&#039;re sending non-JSON data you need to access the raw response using the xhr object passed as first argument, so replace <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>alert(&quot;Data is &quot; + data);</code></pre></div><p>with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>alert(&quot;Data is &quot; + x.responseText);</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>Ah! I now see that in Firebug x contains all the relevant info...

					<p>You are welcome.ï¼©am wondering how&nbsp; to pass an argument to that function.<br />What if I want to get some input from user then pass it to the function(in your example is &quot;action_my_function&quot;). How to achieve that?</p>									</div>
