					<p>Hello OpenWRT community! I&#039;ve been a DD-WRT user for sometime and I&#039;m in general happy with the performance I&#039;ve had on that router (TP-Link WR841N). What attracts me to OpenWRT is the fact that it allows a lot more customization. </p><p>In selecting a good router to flash with OpenWRT, I&#039;ve narrowed down my choice to 2 routers<br />TP-Link WR1043N (64/8 RAM/flash in MB, v2 and above)<br />Asus RT-N14U (64/16 RAM/flash in MB)<br />(feel free to drop more suggestions that have a good quality/price ratio, I haven&#039;t bought any router yet, still doing research)</p><p>The available flash on each router, plus the fact the Asus box is roughly 20€ cheaper than the TP-Link leave me inclined to the Asus box. In spite of the documentation for the TP-Link WR1043N being one of the most complete hardware-specific pages I&#039;ve found in this forum. </p><p>As it seems, the Asus RT-N14U supports the chaos calmer (15.05) image. Even-though this router&#039;s page (still) points to the 14.07 image:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ramips/mt7620n/openwrt-ramips-mt7620n-rt-n14u-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>The SoC on this router is the Ralink MT7620N. I would like to confirm that the 15.05 image for this router is located here:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ramips/mt7620/openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-rt-n14u-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … pgrade.bin</a><br />Note that the SoC in the 15.05 URL is referred to as mt7620, without the &quot;n&quot;.</p><p>A related question is about the naming of these images. For an upgrade from OEM firmware, I should be using a &quot;...-factory.bin&quot;, but I cannot find such an image for this router. Is it ok to upgrade from an OEM image with a &quot;...-sysupgrade.bin&quot; image?</p><p>Now for an unrelated question... <br />Many routers have a USB port, including the two I&#039;ve mentioned. Is it possible to expand the space available for OpenWRT packages by using USB storage?</p><p>Thanks for your time and patience in reading this post!</p>									</div>
