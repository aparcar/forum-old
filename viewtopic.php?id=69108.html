					<p>Hello,<br />vlan50 + vlan51 use one trunk port and are bridged to different wifis on my openwrt access point (wr841n v8).</p><p>I have already setup the firewall rules on my router (different device), and want to make sure that both vlans are also completly isolated from each other on my openwrt access point.</p><p>Do I have to setup firewall rules on my openwrt access point as well, or is it not necessary since it has already been done on the external router?<br />If I also have to setup firewall rules also on my openwrt access point, which rules do I need exactly?</p><br /><br /><br /><p>Here is a screenshot of my interface configuration:<br />bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=1f3f66-1482799622.png</p><br /><br /><br /><p>I really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance and please let me know, if more information need to be provided to solve this issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>It would be helpful if you could post your /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless files.&nbsp; &nbsp;The screenshot does show most of the configuration, but it is helpful to see the full config.</p><p>Also, it looks like vid 50 is configured as DHCP (are you using it as the management network?) whereas vid 51 is &quot;unmanaged&quot;.&nbsp; Can you give a little more background on what you are trying to accomplish?</p><p>From what I can see, it does appear that vid 50 and vid 51 have no way to move packets between them, so you should have full isolation (what I think you are going for)</p><p>The only issue I see is that you have access to the management interface from vid 50, which could be a security issue depending on your configuration.</p>									</div>
