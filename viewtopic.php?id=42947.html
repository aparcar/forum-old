					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m new to the forum.</p><p>I bought a TP-Link WDR3600 and would like to flash OpenWRT.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there an image/file that contains Luci, so I can use the web GUI directly after the flash?</p><p>Another question, I currently have a TP-Link WR1043ND, I was using Gargoyle, but switched to DD-WRT solely because I couldn&#039;t get Gargoyle 1.59 to read the VPN provider config files(it&#039;s config&#039;d and running fine with DD-WRT).&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to run a VPN server, I want the router to act as a client to connect to a VPN provider/server (AirVPN) with every device connected also going through the VPN, is this possible with OpenWRT?</p><p>I thought Gargoyle was leaner/better firmware, less bloated with a trillion options like DD-WRT, but the VPN client config was a show stopper for me.</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe the attitude adjustment rc1&nbsp; images have LuCI built in.&nbsp; &nbsp; However, you&#039;ll have to download and install openvpn (probably best to install luci-app-vpn&nbsp; which will pull openvpn in with it as a dependency)</p><p>All builds require that you telnet it to set the password first anyway. </p><p>Make sure you read the wiki page about how to install this... <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600</a>&nbsp; (really you have to link the linked wdr4300) </p><p>Also note that Gargoyle is OpenWRT underneath&nbsp; (though w/ a different gui and some other mods)</p><p>If you are averse to complexity... i think giving Gargoyle another try might be the best way to go.&nbsp; (in your thread on the airvpn forum you weren&#039;t at all clear about WHAT didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just saying that &quot;it wouldn&#039;t accept the files&quot; is not going to allow people to help you.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply.</p><p>Once again, this is more than I have ever gotten on the Gargoyle forum.</p><p>The Gargoyle web GUI accepted the &quot;certificates&quot; in the displayed fields, however, the config files (server ip address, protocol, port) were not accepted in the displayed fields, &quot;error: could not find config files&quot; was displayed after every attempt.</p><p>The zip files: I did unpack the Zip files, however, in the Gargoyle GUI&gt;&gt;VPN&gt;&gt;Client config= there is an option to input the config files manually, i.e. 3 separate fields, or Gargoyle can extract what it needs from the Zip file and insert them in the appropriate locations.&nbsp; Neither of these options worked for me, &quot;error: could not find config files&quot; was displayed after countless attempts.</p><p>Here is a link to the exact screen in Gargoyle:</p><p><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3580">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … amp;t=3580</a></p><p>Once again, thanks for your reply.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you&#039;re being overly harsh about the Gargoyle forum.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some people answered you even in the thread you post.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Also this forum has often been quite dead w/ many posts just sitting there w/ zero responses )</p><p>Anyway...&nbsp; if you read this post it looks like some guy had the same problem:<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=3023#p13759">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … 023#p13759</a></p><p>And looking at your picture here <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IaVZD.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/IaVZD.jpg</a><br />it looks like you specified a client certificate file w/o specifying a client key file.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s probably the file not found that it&#039;s complaining about.</p><p>If you&#039;re using a client cert then you need the private key associated with it.&nbsp; </p><p>----<br />Some of the information in the following thread about how to set up with Tomato might help make sense of the gargoyle setup as well.<br /><a href="https://airvpn.org/index.php?option=com_kunena&amp;func=view&amp;catid=2&amp;id=6652&amp;Itemid=142">https://airvpn.org/index.php?option=com … Itemid=142</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vhrm</strong> on 18 Mar 2013, 19:33)</p>

					<p>&quot;the guy had the same problem&quot; he said:<br />=&gt;<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hello and thank you for your work on this firmware.</p><p>I&#039;m using Gargoyle on several routers of mine, and tried to take advantage of the OpenVPN feature in the latest versions.

But both in this and in the previous versions, i get this message &quot;ERROR: Could not find config file&quot; when i try to setup the client configuration, either manually or by uploading ovpn and pem CA file.</p><p>Is there anything i&#039;m doing wrong? Thanks in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>EDIT: Found it, must fill in Client Certificate File and Client Key File for it to work!</p></blockquote></div><p>And then i pointed you to the &quot;tomato&quot; set-up (https://airvpn.org/index.php?option=com … Itemid=142)&nbsp; which looks fairly involved.&nbsp; You have to cut and paste things from different files, maybe create some files etc.&nbsp; </p><p>---<br />Your statement that you &quot;input all three certificates&quot; is probably incorrect because you&#039;re supposed to input&nbsp; 2 certificates and a key.&nbsp; &nbsp;So either you used the wrong word or you misunderstand something and did something wrong.</p><br /><p>Overall you seem to be focused on how Gargoyle sucks (and maybe it does, i don&#039;t know or care really) rather than trying to understand what&#039;s going on OR communicating the SPECIFICS of what you tried so that maybe someone could help.</p><p>Saying you &quot;tried everything&quot; doesn&#039;t really help.&nbsp; If it&#039;s true then ok.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can&#039;t try anything more, so then there&#039;s nothing to talk about.</p>									</div>
