					<p>Update posted over here.<br /><a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=6807&amp;p=27660#p27660">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/v … 660#p27660</a></p><p>One of the most-requested features for a while has been support for a Guest Wireless Network. This feature is now implemented in 1.7.1.</p><p>Two important limitations exist with this feature, as currently implemented in 1.7.1: </p><p>(1) Unlike some implementations of this feature, there isn&#039;t a separate subnet defined for the guest network, the hosts are isolated using ebtables rules<br />instead of using a separate subnet which means that the guest network shares the same range of IP addresses as the primary access point. The downside to<br />this is that you can&#039;t match only guest-network IPs very easily with quotas/qos etc. Further releases will implement ways to match only the guest network<br />in the Quotas and QoS sections but for now this is not possible.</p><p>(2) I don&#039;t recommend trying to use ap+client mode if you&#039;re going to enable the guest network. My experience is that it will work for a while and then<br />become very unstable. I will investigate to see if there is a way to fix this, but I may disable enabling the guest network altogether when in ap+client<br />mode.</p><p>In addition to guest network support, there are numerous bugfixes in this release, for issues identified in 1.7.0. Most of the minor (and one or two more<br />major issues) that were identified after moving to the Barrier Breaker branch of OpenWRT have now been addressed.</p><p>New in 1.7.1:<br />list of 10 items<br />• Guest Network Support<br />• Support for WAN connection via QMI<br />• Fixes several bugs preventing OpenVPN from working properly<br />• Fixes display of second 5GHz band SSID on Status/Overview page of dual band routers<br />• Fixes USB Printer Support<br />• Fixes Button Handlers<br />• Fixes 3G support by fixing test to determine whether 3G device exists<br />• Fixes issue with restarting minidlna<br />• Add citynetwork.se ddns provider<br />• Fixes issue with throttling hosts exceeding quotas being assigned the wrong QoS class</p>									</div>
