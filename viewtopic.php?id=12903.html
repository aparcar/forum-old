					<p>Hi, </p><p> I&#039;ve setup the following<br />&nbsp; - free radius (on a seperate server) with its own CA root<br />&nbsp; - Windows XP / Linux wpa_supplicant clients with personal certificates<br />&nbsp; - Kamikaze (7.09) running in Access mode on an interface:</p><p>config wifi-iface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wifi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rad-1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hidden&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption wpa+wpa2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; radpass<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option server&nbsp; &nbsp;172.16.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1812<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option isolate&nbsp; 0</p><p> The clients can connect to the network, I see all the TLS Challenge/Response on the server and <br /> I supply (dhcpd on the seperate server) the clients with an IP address.</p><p> All works great.</p> <br /><br /><p> Now I&#039;ld like to expand the wireless reach and add several (also Kamikaze 7.09) APs with WDS.</p><p> I added an extra interface for the WDS link on both APs:<br />config wifi-iface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wds-link<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option bssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;mac of the neighbour&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption wpa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12345678<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hidden&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option timeout&nbsp; 30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option lazywds&nbsp; 0</p><p>and added the same &#039;wifi&#039; setup for the wpa+wpa2 on the second AP.</p><p>And then... nothing works anymore.&nbsp; Running the &#039;AP&#039; interface and the &#039;WDS&#039; interface in &#039;encryption: none&#039; goes ok, <br />but swithing the &#039;WDS&#039; interface to some form of encryption, the link breaks.</p><p>I can&#039;t get the &#039;AP&#039; interface running with wpa+wpa2 and the &#039;WDS&#039; interface with &#039;none&#039;. Although this isn&#039;t what I want, I suspected that it <br />atleast would work..</p><p>Anyone some pointers, how to create ap/repeater links which are encrypted? I&#039;ve searched a great deal and can&#039;t get a WDS link working, when<br />using wpa+wpa2 on the AP part.</p><br /><p>On a side note: is it possible, to retrieve a list of associated macs using wlc or some other tool? This would ease my debugging ;-)<br /><strong>Ha, just noticed this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-6d3c54c67ef518ded265343a7dea83ad381cfa15">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-6d3c54 â€¦ ad381cfa15</a></strong></p><p>ps: these are WRT54GL devices.</p><p>Cheers, Eric</p><br /><p>edit1: Could a time-difference between the wired AP and the (wireless) WDS/AP be a problem? I&#039;m running an ntpclient on the wired one..</p><p>edit2: I don&#039;t see any traffic on the wl0 interface (the wired AP), but the frame counter is increasing steadily. It looks like there are communication issues between both devices, although keys etc are identical.</p><p>edit3: without the WDS link, I am able to get Sony Ericsson P1i and Nokia N95 to authenticate against the radius server, using all the needed certificates on the devices. This is working really great. Now just to get the WDS link up.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EL</strong> on 8 Oct 2007, 22:36)</p>

					<p>I was hoping I wouldn&#039;t have to reply to my own posts, but maybe some folks can shed a light on this.</p><p>I&#039;ve included the patch as mentioned in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2463">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2463</a> . The WDS link appears to work (encrypted), but only when<br />there is no encryption on the lan part.</p><p>The <strong>lan</strong> part is has an <strong>encryption: wpa+wpa2</strong> and <br />the <strong>wds</strong> part an <strong>encryption: psk2</strong>. This does <strong>NOT</strong> work.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried the other (2) variants for nas4not, but nothing seems to give me a working WDS, when the lan part is using wpa+wpa2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EL</strong> on 9 Oct 2007, 14:11)</p>

					<p>Things get weirder:</p><p> running wpa+wpa2 on the lan interface and psk on the wds part:<br /> starting udhcpc -i wds0.1 on one device shows requests and replies on the wl0 interface of the other device.<br /> although I don&#039;t see this on the interface of the device where I run udhcpc...</p>									</div>
