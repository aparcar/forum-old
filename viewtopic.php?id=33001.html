					<p>how many people should connect to your box? they would have root access! so it should be you, and maybe 1-2 really trustable guys.<br />dropbear can handle public-keys from openssh, I&#039;m not sure about the other way around. but for a few keys it shouldn&#039;t be a problem. If you want to allow may &quot;untrustable&quot; people to connect to your box (or network behind this box) consider openvpn just because it doesn&#039;t need root-access</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 18 Nov 2011, 01:55)</p>

					<p>tnx eleon216</p><p>Authentication with standard OpenSSH key-pairs is supported, however, a private key conversion is necessary when used as client.<br />I had to rule out openvpn for some reasons(memory contrains-timesync- a.s.o), so i am checking to implement tunnels over ssh / ping /dns<br />*<br />I did not mention the purpose of my intention.<br />*<br />scope : root access/tunnel to the router as fallback for maintainance<br />&nbsp; The ssh root access tunnel should serve as a last resort to access the router for maintainance as a fallback in case everything else goes south.<br />&nbsp; The tunnel must be installed by the troubled router fully automatically from the his site.<br />&nbsp; This can be used &quot;bootstrapping&quot;&nbsp; other forms of connections.<br />*<br />At&nbsp; the minute the test-setup for a openssh-dropbear works both ways with rsa keys but is rather complicated to implement&nbsp; a fully automatic script.</p><p>Surprisingly i found that the dbclient of dropbear 0.5 has a DROPBEAR_PASSWORD environment variable to specify a dbclient password which makes it possible to set a ssh connection by only using username/password.<br />Although using this in a script has an issue with terminal input, which hopefully i try to solve, so i can run the tunnel setup in a cronjob.</p><p>I will mak some notes how about the outcome</p><p>regards<br />3zl</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>3zl</strong> on 18 Nov 2011, 11:22)</p>

					<p>maybe check out the package &quot;autossh&quot; to automatically connect, and keep the connection alive. Probably easier than building your own script.</p>									</div>
