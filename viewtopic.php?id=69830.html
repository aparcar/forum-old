					<p>Hello there!</p><p>Before I go on with my problem, I&#039;d like to mention that I&#039;m not really familiar with router configuration and networking in general, but I know a thing or two. I hope that I will still be able to get some help here.</p><p>I recently switched provider from 20mbit DSL to 100mbit optical and they provided me with modem and router in one. Unfortunately now I&#039;m having constant spikes every 3 minutes on wireless and from my understanding it&#039;s the router. I saw spikes while pinging the router and there is no problem when connected with cable. I had no problems with previous provider and router. Correct me please, if the issue could be something else.</p><p>So to the <strong>problem:</strong> <br />My main router/modem is Alcatel Lucent I-240W-A.<br />Secondary router is TP-Link TL-WR740N/ND v4 with OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)</p><p>Since TP-Link was working fine before, I hope that connecting it to main router with cable and accessing secondary one would solve the spike issue. </p><p>I&#039;v been through some tutorials and basically I get stuck at all of them at the point where I have to change secondary router&#039;s IP. Whenever I do that and click to apply changes it get&#039;s stuck and I have to hard reset the router. Last tutorial I tried was wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap#configuration_via_command_line_tools using web interface. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Um, it could be a lot of things.&nbsp; Could be congested radio paths. Could be misconfig.&nbsp; If it were me I would ask your provider to put their device(the Alcatel) and into layer2 mode(sometimes called bridged mode).&nbsp; After they do that, plug your WAN port from the TP-Link and plug it into the/one of the LAN ports on the Alcatel.&nbsp; </p><p>That&#039;s just me, do what you feel.</p><p>CB</p>									</div>

					<p>I doubt that it could be congested radio path because my TP-Link was working in the same channel as this one.&nbsp; Thanks! Will see if that works.</p>									</div>

					<p>Those spikes every three minutes could be the router reauthenticating the clients; have a look at the configuration on the primary router.</p><p>Now, about configuring the secondary router, remember that you have to reconfigure your computer when you apply those changes, as the router and the computer are now on different networks.</p>									</div>
