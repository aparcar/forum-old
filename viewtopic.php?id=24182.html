					<p>I need to compile <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cups-bjnp/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cups-bjnp/</a> but I cannot just do make on the router where it needs to be compiled. It first requires ./configure to generate a make file in order to run make but this must be done on the router as well but it requires gcc or other c compiler to generate the make file. How can I compile either gcc into ipk for AR71xx/AR7240/AR913x profile or run config to then compile using make on the router? I have tried unsuccessfully to cross compile using the backfire sdk but it keeps giving me a no rule for this package error before even starting. Am I SOL because without the bjnp, which to be quite honest I am surprised is not native like hplip, I cannot install my printer over the network?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks JoW. I am going to try out the makefile just to see how it works and the ipk of course for production <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

The printer is plugged into an ethernet port on the router which I believe requires BJNP protocol which is what Canon uses to print to networked PIXNA printers and this backend is required to do that via CUPS much like HPLIP for HP printers. I might be mistaken in my underlying assumptions though and if so please feel free to clarify my info so I have a better handle of the issue!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skarlson</strong> on 7 Apr 2010, 23:03)</p>

					<p>Ah my apologizes I didn&#039;t realize that you a had a network printer. But since you have a network printer can&#039;t you have all your clients establish a connection to it? I&#039;m just trying to figure out the benefit of using cups w/ a network printer to share the printer.</p>									</div>

					<p>I successfully installed the bjnp backend and got the printer running in cups. It is now shared and is my default printer for the network. Thanks for your help JoW! Now I have to get sane working but I haven&#039;t even begun looking at that; its getting late.</p>									</div>
