					<p>Ok, this was a problem I had 6 months ago, and I decided to drop it, and stop wasting my time with it. I decided to tackle it again, and still no luck, I have spent 4 hours on this, and no luck what so ever, and I am getting really mad, I would use vulgar language, but I will refrain from doing so.</p><p>What I am trying to achieve is when I connect my tp link mr3040 to router via ethernet connection on eth0, I want to connect to my 3040 via wifi(wlan0) and browse the internet, and of course I cannot browse the internet, I can ping when I ssh into the router, I first thought it was a firewall issue, but I disabled my firewall, and still had the problem persist.</p><p>Here are my dhcp,firewall,network, and wireless files, sorry for the term &quot;cute&quot; in my files, I was being a smart A-- and decided to call it that. Also please tell me what routing/zones I can remove in my firewall, I cluttered too much in there, I believe.</p><p>wireless <a href="https://pastebin.com/tfB9cWQt">https://pastebin.com/tfB9cWQt</a><br />network <a href="https://pastebin.com/giVxd3v0">https://pastebin.com/giVxd3v0</a><br />dhcp <a href="https://pastebin.com/ZyeaXZHK">https://pastebin.com/ZyeaXZHK</a><br />firewall <a href="https://pastebin.com/cu7FsAzU">https://pastebin.com/cu7FsAzU</a></p>									</div>

					<p>If you want only a basic wired to wifi converter, that is called a &quot;dumb AP&quot; and is set up this way:</p><p>Start with a default configuration.<br />In /etc/config/network, change the LAN IP to something that is not the same as your main router, but in the same range.&nbsp; Remember this setting this is where you will log into the router.<br />Add option gateway&nbsp; and option dns to lan, the IP address pointing to the main router.&nbsp; This lets the AP&#039;s CPU access the Internet, for example to set the time of day clock.<br />In /etc/config/dhcp, put &quot;ignore 1&quot; under LAN and delete the IPv6 modes.&nbsp; Your clients will receive their DHCP from the main router.<br />In /etc/config/wireless, create an AP and attach it to the lan network.</p><p>You don&#039;t have to set up any firewall.&nbsp; A dumb AP bridges everything through since the Ethernet port and the wifi are in the same network.</p><p>Reboot the router and plug the Ethernet cable into your main router instead of the PC.&nbsp; You should now be able to connect by wifi and have access to the LAN and the Internet.</p>									</div>
