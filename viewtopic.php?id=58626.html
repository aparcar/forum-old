					<p>Hi there,</p><p>i am pretty new with openWRT.</p><p>I&#039;ve got routers with openWRT behind a modem/router connected over a view managable switches. Therefore I cannot use a VLAN in my opinion.</p><p>The TP-Link WRT4300 N750 with openWRT is configured for 3 WIFI networks. I want one of them to not be able to communicate with any other client but the gateway for internet use ...</p><p>Is that possible with openWRT? Does this solution even make sense?</p><p>Thanks for your knowhow!</p><p>haemse</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know anything about switches, but are the connections configured in this router or further up the chain?&nbsp; By that I mean, are these managed, static interfaces in OpenWrt or are they DHCP Clients?</p><p>If the Wi-Fi only VLAN interface is configured using the &#039;static address&#039; protocol (where you assign an IP address and Gateway to it), you can just put it on a different subnet from all the &quot;networked&quot; interfaces.&nbsp; Once you do that, it&#039;s really easy to connect or isolate it using the firewall zones, but by default, just having it on a separate subnet will make the connected clients isolated from all the other access points on the standard subnet.</p><br /><p>Read this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a></p><br /><p>And this forum thread, specifically, which will show you how to configure it for Internet-only access: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28317">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28317</a></p><br /><p>This post in the above thread seems like a dead simple way to configure it using just firewall zones: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=163180#p163180">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 80#p163180</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 24 Jul 2015, 06:36)</p>
