					<p>I stumbled upon this thead googling:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tolaris.com/2013/07/18/poor-openvpn-performance-on-raspberry-pi/">http://www.tolaris.com/2013/07/18/poor- … pberry-pi/</a></p><p>Regarding the output of &#039;openssl speed&#039; vs openvpn performance,&nbsp; I&#039;m curious about the final comment &quot;Damn. That’s not a great deal better than I’m seeing with OpenWRT on my Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH, which can push 13 Mbit over stock OpenVPN&quot;</p><p>Looking at the performance results here:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl</a></p><p>The results for his WZR-HP-G300NH are:</p><p>Backfire 10.03.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Atheros AR9132 rev 2&nbsp; &nbsp; Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />MIPS 24Kc V7.4&nbsp; &nbsp; 266.24 0.9.8t&nbsp; 22143570 6842030 4978220 2494240 3157330 1122950 4812800 4190100&nbsp; &nbsp; 3769420&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.9&nbsp; &nbsp; 143.6 14.5 12.0</p><p>The &quot;6953.07k&quot; [1024] quoted on the &quot;Poor OpenVPN performance on Raspberry Pi&quot; link is 6953070 in the above format,&nbsp; &nbsp;so close to the 6842030 [sha1 value]</p><br /><p>I just bought a TP-Link TL-WR1043nd v2,&nbsp; the results of which are:</p><p>trunk r39753&nbsp; &nbsp; QCA9558@720MHz&nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link TL-WR1043nd v2&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />MIPS 74Kc V5.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;358.80 1.0.1e&nbsp; &nbsp; 45876220 27233280 12434770 5766490 6425940 2307600&nbsp; &nbsp; 12816040 11099140 9820130&nbsp; &nbsp; 8.3&nbsp; &nbsp; 422.5 44.4 36.4</p><br /><p>Tests on my TL-WR1043nd hardware in line with these reported values but I&#039;m seeing only between 300-500Kbyte/sec of openvpn throughput.&nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously it all depends on what cipher he&#039;s using for his vpn and he doesn&#039;t say,&nbsp; just that he&#039;s seeing 13Mbit throughput.</p><p>Any comments?</p>									</div>
