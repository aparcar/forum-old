					<p>I came across an openwrt wiki about adding user accounts, and I was wondering if it&#039;s recommended to set up an additional user and only use the root account or sudo when it&#039;s necessary.&nbsp; I normally do so when I&#039;ve used FreeNAS/FreeBSD on my servers, but I&#039;ve never done so with a router (mainly because the root password is impossible to crack at 28 hexadecimal and symbol characters and I use a 4096 encryption on SSH).</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; Also, is it recommended to reboot the router after installing a package, or what about installing several packages in a row?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 18 Mar 2015, 21:35)</p>
