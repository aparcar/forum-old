					<p>Hello community,</p><p>I have an OpenWRT router in my internal home network interconnecting 10 subnets/VLANs. I have configured a local DNS domain which looks similar like &quot;homenet.XX&quot; where XX is a nonexistent (that is, not yet in use on the Internet) top level domain. My OpenWRT router is configured to resolve local DNS names directly and query my Internet router for all other top level domains. Hosts accross all my VLANs can resolve names like &quot;host1.homenet.XX&quot; unless my OpenWRT router loses connectivity with my Internet router. Is it possible to configure OpenWRT in such a way that it continues resolving local DNS names when my Internet router goes down?</p><p>Thx in advance,</p><p>Steijn van Essen</p>									</div>

For example, if you have a PC named happy which is connected to OpenWrt, its fully qualified host name becomes happy.lan.</p><p>Chaos Calmer also sets <strong>option rebind_protection &#039;1&#039;</strong> /etc/config/dhcp. This will prevent OpenWrt from using the DNS servers in /tmp/resolv.conf.auto for lookups. To correct this, set <strong>option rebind_protection &#039;0&#039;</strong> in /etc/config/dhcp.</p>									</div>
