					<p>(RESOLVED July 29)<br />using Fedora Core 4 environment.<br />Tried RC2 but that build fails on flash2root not being found in base-files-arch (reported before by somebody else early July, but unclear whether resolved).<br />Now tried HEAD but compiler protests against conflicting definitions of static vs. non-static &#039;target_endian&#039; in ffs2-user.h vs. flash_eraseall.c.<br />Any suggestion how to correct this ? Should declaration in ffs2-user.h be copied to flash_eraseall.c ?<br />Help much appreciated, doddel</p><p>(SOLUTION: <br />make a fresh toolchain on basis of latest HEAD. To save download time preserve files in ./dl and put them back after new CVS checkout.<br />The error messages also disappeared after changing the class declaration in the .h file from static to extern, but resulting code did not work; but this may have been caused by other issues in some packages I selected. In any case a fresh start did work fine and produced working WRT54G code)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 30 Jul 2005, 14:46)</p>
