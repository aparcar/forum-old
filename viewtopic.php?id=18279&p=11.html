					<p>Hello, Guys and thank you for great works.</p><p>I have a stupid question.</p><p>Is there any way to re-flash u-boot instead of re-soldering?</p><p>Recently, I ran the following command in order to fetch u-boot<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>snarf http://www.simcop2387.info/wnr2000/u-boot.bin</code></pre></div><p>and I think at that time I didn&#039;t have internet connection and snarf created a 0byte u-boot.bin<br />file. Damn snarf!<br />I didn&#039;t know this and flashed it to mtd0.
