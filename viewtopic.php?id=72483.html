					<p>Hi All!</p><p>Apologies if this has been asked before – I did try and do a search, but couldn’t find the answers I was looking for.</p><p>I have a bought a GL-iNet GL-AR150 to extend the range of my wireless network from a Netgear Nighthawk R7000. I have tried setting the WAN of my AR150 to “Repeater” in WISP mode, then setup a static IP on the LAN settings (set a different IP from the WAN IP on the same subnet, then set my gateway &amp; DNS servers to the main router’s IP address) &amp; remove the DCHP server &amp; disable the firewall on the AR150. Unfortunately when I do this, I don’t get internet connection when a device connects to the AR150.</p><p>I have previously just setup the AR150 WAN connection and set the Wi-Fi SSID &amp; password to the same as my main router. This works, but periodically devices would randomly experience Wi-Fi issues and need to disconnect &amp; reconnect to Wi-Fi to resolve – annoying given I have&nbsp; smart home devices which don’t have interfaces to allow for easy disconnection/reconnection to a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>I’m probably doing something very simple and stupid wrong here, but I can’t figure it out – all I’m basically looking for is for the AR150 to act as a range extender <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>									</div>

					<p>The Netgear appears to be Broadcom chipset so the GL-inet Gui WDS will probably not work.&nbsp; I expect that you will need to use relayd <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><p>There are a few other wikis that may be relevant and can be found linked to this<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#bridgedclientmodeissues">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clie … modeissues</a></p>									</div>
