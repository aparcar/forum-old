					<p>I&#039;m about to buy a router to use with OpenWrt. At the moment my alternatives are:<br />* TP-Link TL-WDR3600<br />* TP-Link TL-WDR4300<br />If I understood the wiki correctly they should have almost the same hardware except the &quot;wifi stack&quot;.<br />In particular: the former (which costs less) is 2T2R and the latter is 3T3R.<br />Of course I would expect the WDR4300 to outperform the WDR3600 when speaking about wifi range/speed.<br />While I was able to find a lot of people online who are really happy with their WDR4300, I&#039;ve also found a lot of people unhappy of its wifi performance.<br />Finally I&#039;ve found this [<a href="http://us.hardware.info/reviews/3423/7/tp-link-tl-wdr3600-and-wdr4300-review-two-shades-of-black-test-results-10-metres">http://us.hardware.info/reviews/3423/7/ … -10-metres</a>] benchmark that seems to confirm that the TL-WDR3600 is actually better than TL-WDR4300.</p><p>1) Does anyone here own one of those devices?<br />2) What is your opinion about them in general?<br />3) What is your opinion about their wifi?<br />4) Do you think that their wifi will work in different rooms of the same house with robust brick/concrete walls?</p><p>I&#039;m also open to other suggestions about different models/brands with GigaBit and 802.11abgn_simultan (1 usb port is a plus but not strictly required).</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>you will not notice a significant difference between these devices unless you have a 3t3r wifi adapter in your device, and even then it probably won&#039;t matter since your internet speed probably does not exceed 300mbps (it would help for internal LAN transfers though, if your PCs are fast enough).

I assume that you don&#039;t refer to the 2 models treated in this thread because they have 2 USB ports and you don&#039;t need an hub to attach 2 devices. Whatever, in most cases, you can use an USB hub to attach more devices (you&#039;ll probably need some with separate alimentation).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openwrt_newbie2</strong> on 22 Oct 2014, 11:02)</p>
