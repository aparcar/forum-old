					<p>Though ad-hoc mode is basically blasting out packets to anyone who might be in range to receive them, you still do need support in the driver to do that.&nbsp; Ad-hoc is also known as IBSS.</p><p>Ralink is generally the chip you&#039;ll want in your USB adapter, as the Linux drivers for them do the most modes.&nbsp; For example the TP-Link TL-WDN-3200, though that is likely discontinued now.</p><p>If you don&#039;t have any strong commitment to BATMAN, consider 802.11s meshing instead, it is very easy to set up as (with a supported card) it is already in the driver.</p>									</div>

					<p>@mazilo<br />I&#039;m the one ?? (stupid) guy, who is working on wifi drivers for linux.<br />They are two chip vendors Realtek and Mediatek</p><p>Just from my memory ...</p><p>EDUP both are using MT7612U<br /><a href="https://github.com/ulli-kroll/mt7612u">https://github.com/ulli-kroll/mt7612u</a><br />There is also a 1T1R version available<br /><a href="https://github.com/ulli-kroll/mt7610u">https://github.com/ulli-kroll/mt7610u</a><br />Both are sharing code and will be merged (hopefully) in one driver and converted to mac80211.</p><p>Comfast uses RTL8812U which is the 2T2R version from RTL8821AU.<br /><a href="https://github.com/ulli-kroll/rtl8821au">https://github.com/ulli-kroll/rtl8821au</a><br />This driver will be attached to the rtlwifi system inside the kernel.</p><p>There is also a 3T3R version available, which is announced as RTL8814AU. <br />Realtek uses some USB2 &lt;-&gt; USB3 switch in software. The last mystery around this I&#039;ve discoverd with the release of the RTL8814AU drivers from Realtek through Trendnet with their AC1900 High power device see.<br /><a href="http://www.trendnet.com/products/proddetail.asp?prod=100_TEW-809UB">http://www.trendnet.com/products/prodde â€¦ _TEW-809UB</a><br />Currently the RTL8814AU part is not in my repository.</p><p>They might be more flavors from these drivers on github.com but.<br />- first, I don&#039;t care<br />- second, they use wireless-ext or cfg80211 in any variation of AP/STA/Adhoc/Mon<br />- they do only fixes</p><p>I have all three of them and some more on my desk to test.</p><p>Hans Ulli</p>									</div>
