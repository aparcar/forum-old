					<p>I installed the most recent version of Chaos Calmer on my Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH and everything worked as expected.&nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted to use this as a secondary access point to cover other part of my propertery and I wanted this router&#039;s AP to be on the same local subnet as my main router, so I changed the Buffalo to a static IP of 192.168.1.250 (gateway is 192.168.1.254 and I unchecked the local DNS server.&nbsp; &nbsp; I then connected a jumper from one of the Buffalo&#039;s LAN ports to one of the LAN ports of the main router via an extended cable.&nbsp; &nbsp; Everything works fine using either the main router wireless or the new Buffalo wireless AP, except for the failure of the new Buffalo updating package and running diagnostics.&nbsp; &nbsp;I get the following:<br />wget: bad address &#039;downloads.openwrt.org&#039;<br />wget: bad address &#039;downloads.openwrt.org&#039;<br />wget: bad address &#039;downloads.openwrt.org&#039;</p><p>Also running diagnostics, the Ping fails.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Now I tried adding the IP of the main router (192.168.1.254) in the &quot;gateway field&quot; of the interface definition of the new Buffalo and also adding a OpenDNS address in the DNS field of the new Buffalo but the Update attempt of the packages still fails.&nbsp; </p><p>What do I need to do in order to have the package updater in the new Buffalo be able to access the Internet like the wireless AP clients do?</p>									</div>

					<p>Usually it works to set both gateway and DNS on the LAN page to be the IP of your main router.&nbsp; <br />You can delete the WAN interface entirely on the AP router to avoid confusion from that.</p>									</div>

					<p>That did it!&nbsp; &nbsp;I deleted WAN and WAN6 and then directed gateway and DNS server to 192.168.1.254, the IP of my main gateway, packages installed fine then.</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>
