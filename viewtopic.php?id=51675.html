					<p>Hi guys, a few days ago I got hit with a power outage, after which my trusty wrt54g (v2) awoke with a blinking power light (no other lights). Normally this indicates a bad firmware, so I tried to connect to it via a Raspberry Pi using:</p><p>1. Serial port<br />2. Jtag</p><p>The serial port was silent (both of them). The JTAG gave some hope, in that the chip was detected, as was the flash. However, the CPU refused to enter debug mode, no matter the combination of switches that I used.</p><p>After doing a wholeflash backup, erase, and flashing a fresh CFE, I still see nothing at 192.168.1.1 nor on the serial port.</p><p>I am afraid something is burned out. What could it be? Has anyone ever done a successful JTAG flash with a CPU not in debug mode?</p><p>PS. This linksys has been with me forever, it makes me sad to see it go <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
