					<p>Since I haven&#039;t received any reply in my old topic (forum.openwrt org/viewtopic.php?pid=348937 )&nbsp; I thought I start here.</p><p>The issues I&#039;m having so far:<br />- cannot break uboot default<br />- can&#039;t figure out GPIOs (maybe some of them are hardcoded), only found out about the red LED and the reset button<br />- the default image has 5 mtd blocks, not sure if I&#039;m declaring them correctly, see below<br />- can&#039;t figure out how to load to SDRAM for testing since I cannot boot to uboot. Is there any way to do this from the normal boot environment?<br />- recommended naming conventions for new devices?</p><p>What was achieved so far:<br />- identified flash chip and added declaration into the DTS file<br />- dumped mtdblock 0 through 5<br />- know where the blocks above are situated in the SPI flash<br />- have the kernel config file from the factory firmware<br />- I think I know what devices and modules need to be included<br />- can flash individual blocks from factory firmware (mtdwrite)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /proc/cpuinfo

					<p>Sorry, I was looking at the post above that mentioned altering the source dir.<br />So instead I should make changes into this folder: /target/linux/ramips/base-files/etc<br />Is it better to modify ./board.d/02_network or add a new file into ./uci-defaults?
