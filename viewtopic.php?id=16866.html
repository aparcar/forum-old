					<p>Are there any published guidelines for updating the Wiki?<br />For instance, I was going to add internal pictures of Airlink101 AR670W.<br />Is there a standard format for the hardware platform info page?<br />Embedded pictures seem to be rare; are they actively discouraged (ie for bandwidth limits?)<br />(In favor of links to external photo hosting sites, perhaps?)<br />Is there particular info that should be included before it&#039;s worthwhile to have a page at all?<br />(ie all I&#039;ve got so far are photos...)</p><p>Thanks<br />WestfW</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi WestfW</p><p>I noticed the links to older docs (such as screenshot guidelines) are broken/gone. If you&#039;re interested in contributing here, let me know, we can perhaps start working on new guidelines.</p><p>I don&#039;t have much time (maybe 1h/week) for this but I am interested in improving OpenWRT docs for beginners and adding screenshots to existing docs.</p><p>Look up my IM / email contact info at <a href="http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/contact">http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/contact</a></p>									</div>
