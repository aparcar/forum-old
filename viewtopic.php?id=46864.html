					<p>Hi,<br />I was wondering if the changeset supporting for WD N600 could be tweaked to support this nearly identical router.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n600</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n750">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n750</a><br />I uploaded the OpenWRT firmware for WD n600, but it did not work. Specifically I flashed:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-mynet-n600-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a><br />The ethernet lights were off. The wifi LED was blinking initially, and then became stable within a minute. But no wifi SSID was visible. </p><p>I also tweaked the chageset at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/38076">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/38076</a> and built an image. With that, even the WIFI led was not blinking. Specifically, I changed the board id in the last part of the diff from wrgnd16_wd_db600 to wrgnd13_wd_db600. So, the new line was:<br />$(eval $(call SingleProfile,Seama,64k,MYNETN600,mynet-n600,MYNET-N600,ttyS0,115200,$$(mynet_n600_mtdlayout),wrgnd13_wd_db600,1310720,16187392)) </p><p>I got the board id from <a href="http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Western_Digital_My_Net_N750">http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Western_Digital_My_Net_N750</a><br />I also noticed that the output of cat /proc/mtd on that page looks different from the mtdlayout in the above changeset.<br />The changeset says<br />mynet_n600_mtdlayout=mtdparts=spi0.0:256k(u-boot)ro,64k(u-boot-env)ro,64k(devdata)ro,64k(devconf)ro,1280k(kernel),14592k(rootfs),64k(radiocfg)ro,15872k@0x70000(firmware) </p><p>But the page above says:<br /># cat /proc/mtd<br />dev:&nbsp; &nbsp; size&nbsp; &nbsp;erasesize&nbsp; name<br />mtd0: 0099d000 00010000 &quot;rootfs&quot;<br />mtd1: 00f80000 00010000 &quot;upgrade&quot;<br />mtd2: 00010000 00010000 &quot;devdata&quot;<br />mtd3: 00010000 00010000 &quot;devconf&quot;<br />mtd4: 00010000 00010000 &quot;radiocfg&quot;<br />mtd5: 01000000 00010000 &quot;flash&quot;<br />mtd6: 00040000 00010000 &quot;bootloader&quot;<br />mtd7: 00010000 00010000 &quot;bdcfg&quot;<br />mtd8: 00010000 00010000 &quot;devrev1&quot;<br />mtd9: 00010000 00010000 &quot;devrev2&quot;<br />mtd10: 00020000 00010000 &quot;devrev3&quot;</p><p>Any guidance would be appreciated.

The good news is that the n600 layout is correct enough that we don&#039;t fry the bootloader or radio calibration.

But I am not sure.</p><p>Anyway, I believe the hardware of this device seems most similar to the DIR-825-C1. There is no direct connection between eth0 and any particular jack; that&#039;s all handled by VLANs in the switch programming. It&#039;s possible the wireless code already works without without change, but I am not very interested in the device until the wired ethernet works.</p><p>There&#039;s a 3.3v serial header soldered in, identical to the N600. You&#039;ll need a &quot;security&quot; Torx screwdriver bit to take out the screws the...correct way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>ro flag marks partition as read only obviously. You should have ro everywhere where you don&#039;t need modifications from OpenWRT level (or it&#039;s unsafe). Basically above is correct, I think it would also be possible to have kernel partition with &#039;ro&#039; since sysupgrade writes to &#039;firmware&#039; partition which is overlay over kernel and rootffs.<br />I see there is some progress about this router on mailing list, I will ask guy there to write here too.</p><p>ps.

					<p>I tried flashing OpenWRT to my Western Digital MY NET N750 (Model E2F with stock firmware 1.04.16 via Windows 8.1) today using the instructions posted on OpenWRT under &quot;Installing OpenWRT&quot; (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n750">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n750</a>)&nbsp; to no avail.&nbsp; </p><p>I tried several times and also on two separate N750 routers (I have two of the same model:&nbsp; one in router mode and one in AP mode).&nbsp; After following the steps, especially resetting the router, and attempting to upload the .bin file, the N750 generates a &quot;Firmware Upload File,&quot; &quot;Invalid image file....&quot; message.</p><p>Note:&nbsp; I did not quite understand step 2 or &quot;Configure your computers [sic] IP address to 192.168.1.10....&quot;&nbsp; However, after surfing the &#039;net for guidance, I think that I figured it out and changed my the IPV 4 TCP/IPv4 adapter settings to the address provided in the step.&nbsp; I was unable to connect to the router via the LAN port without making the IPV 4 change, but could with the change made.&nbsp; Thus, I think that I successfully followed step 2.</p><p>Note too:&nbsp; I successfully flashed updated stock firmware to both of my N750 routers and I also unlocked/rooted/flashed custom RUUs to my HTC One V and now Nexus 5.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not like I am a complete flashing noob (at least an end user noob).&nbsp; It&#039;s been my experience that steps are always left out of procedures and I almost always need to view many sites, and cobble together a complete set of procedures, but I just couldn&#039;t find any other sites to expand on the OpenWRT installation steps.</p><p>Please advise and thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ludoviclalo</strong> on 23 Dec 2013, 03:41)</p>

					<p>I have a different issue, I assigned IP to eth0 and I think I should have assigned to eth0.1. I cannot ssh to router at all. It is at present in bridge mode, I can access internet via lan port and other lan port of router is connected to my main router. WAN port has no access or does not work. After flash I was unable to get Internet to get luci to install and led to this thread and current state. I think at present router has no ip and I am dangling. I scanned IPs on subnet and none of the IP works. <br />I could not find link for serial access details. I am used to some page where some information is listed with little change but here I may have to solder and then access. I can solder and create cable and access but not sure where on this board I will attach and what are the pin configurations. I too need some tools for accessing console because I am not sure if native Win 7 provides such tools. There used to be HyperTerminal but don&#039;t see it any more.

That makes sense, I only had Gigabit gear in arms reach when I was testing. For curiosity&#039;s sake is there a public manual / method to deciphering the 32-bit config strings on the AR8327 or was it derived from using a source drop from a similar platform (e.g. TP-LINK WR1043ND) and seeing if it worked?</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s in the AR8327N datasheet. It&#039;s not public but can be found if looked for hard enough (like #2 result on Google search for &quot;AR8327N datasheet&quot;). If you come across one you will find the explanation on p.37.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Heffer</strong> on 28 Dec 2013, 18:10)</p>

					<p>Just chiming in to thank Heffer &amp; co. for their work getting this router supported by OpenWRT, and in the nighly builds. Everything seems to work perfectly, and BB from last night flashed straight on, no issues. This seems like a solid 450Mbps N router with the stock firmware gone.</p>									</div>
