					<p>I went to the sierra web page and it doesn&#039;t list linux as being supported but I thought someone had ported the driver to linux already? I am also wandering if I can get this card working in openwrt on an Asus 500g premium router. It just sucks using a computer with internet sharing.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I found the supported linux driver sierra.c. I was wandering if I could compile it into the 2.6 kernal? I am sure I can but my knowledge is limited. It says you need the driver since the card doesn&#039;t use standard AT commands. I would also like to use KPPP gui since I am doing this for my brother-in-law and it might be easier for him to use since it is a gui. I also found the ppp script files for this card.</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
