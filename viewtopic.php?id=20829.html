					<p>I have LinksysWRT54GS v.1.0. There is OpenWrt loaded and working but I do not have admin/pass nor any other setup info so I can not configure (router is a gift). I nedd to load original firmware.<br />I have static address, half duplex 10Mb setup.</p><p>When I connect it to power PWR led flashing for 3s (DMZ=off) then PWR is dim and DMS=on, after app. 40s DMZ=off , WLAN and PWR dim. 3s before DMZ is going off PWR flashes for 3 seconds. (Port 1 led is on. During process all 4port leds blink once or twice)<br />Router is not pingable(192.168.1.1) – first it returns Host not reachable then (after app. 1 minute) TimeOut</p><p>When I connect it to power while reset button pressed on and hold for 2-3s it behaves in the same way.</p><p>When I connect it to power while reset button pressed it behaves differently.<br />PWR led flashes for 3s DMZ=off ;<br />then PWR=ON, DMZ=ON;<br />after 4s all port led blink twice - 1 short and 1 long – (2sec. ) blinks; port 1 stays ON<br />at this moment I release reset button; DMZ is ON<br />after another 7sec DMZ goes OFF; PWR,WLAN =ON and port 1 led blinking (ping)<br />Ping is runing (1ms and TTL=64). WXP shows connected. OperWRT gives „No webpages currently available“ message. Ping starts app 2 s after DMZ goes OFF.</p><p>I tried many times at different time to tftp binary firmware but no success. TimeOut error meassage.<br />(tftp –i 192.168.1.1. PUT &quot;binaryfilename&quot;.bin)<br />And think that timing to start tftp is crucial but I do not know when the best time is. Or is there anything else I overlooked? Any suggestion appriciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you haven&#039;t given up by now, you need to hold the reset button for 2 seconds after the DMZ LED comes on. The DMZ light turning on lets you know that it has finished loading the first section and is in the OpenWRT startup. If you succeeded the DMZ led will start to blink and will stay blinking to let you know that it is in &quot;reset mode&quot;. After that boots, you can login with telnet to 192.168.1.1 from a computer that has a static IP address in that range (ie: 192.168.1.10) and you should be ready to go.<br />If you want to keep the OpenWRT firmware on the router, just run the command firstboot from telnet after you login. That will reset the password and the configuration on the router letting you login via telnet or the web.</p><p>Aaron Z</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aczlan</strong> on 23 Sep 2009, 16:12)</p>
