					<p>Hello all,<br />I&#039;m using buildroot-ng on an ubuntu 6.06 box and menuconfig RUNS fine so far. However, After the first run, I was unable to find the menu to configure BusyBox options. It seems to have disappeared! It was there on the first run. Also, I noticed that hasurl is not selected as a default package in buildroot-ng. Isn&#039;t that needed for the Web interface or was that only in the prebuilt OpenWrt firmware?</p>									</div>

					<p>Like I said, it&#039;s not there. I do the following:<br />root@hostname:~/buildroot-ng/openwrt# make menuconfig</p><p>I then use the down-arrow to highlight &#039;Base system&#039; and press &lt;enter&gt; key. At this point, I see the following options:</p><p>&lt;*&gt; base-files<br />&lt;M&gt; libpthread<br />&lt;*&gt; uclibc<br />&lt;*&gt; busybox</p><p>Arrrrgh!! Nooooooo!<br />Cannot compute: not in alpha-numeric order!! Does not stand out!</p><p>Allright, so I started typing this and kicked myself in the teeth.. I kind of expected items with submenus to indicate the presence of said submenu, such a with a &#039;---&gt;&#039; as is done with the main menu. All of the items under base-system have part of the text cut-off on the right side. Menu-items seem to have too many periods in them.<br />On the right side, I see:<br />&#039;OpenWrt syste&#039;<br />&#039;POSIX threa&#039;<br />&lt;nothing but dots&gt;<br />&#039;Core utilities for embed&#039;<br />&#039;Small SSH 2 clie&#039;<br />&#039;Utility for converting&#039;<br />&#039;IPv4 firewall administra&#039;<br />&#039;IPv6 firewall administra&#039;<br />everything after those strings is not visible and is cut-off. Is there a way to set my screen res. in a VT? In knoppix, I use vga=&lt;nnn&gt; to set screen parameters on VTs. (Hmmm, where is my &quot;Knoppix pocket reference&quot; book by &quot;O&#039;Reilly&quot;). I&#039;ll try appending that to my kernel parameters in my grub config file.</p>									</div>
