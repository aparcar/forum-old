					<p>Well, I edited DROPBEAR_ARGS in /etc/init.d/dropbear and ran it. My connection was dropped and I could not reconnect until the router was restarted. It looks like I hit <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/5498">closed bug 5498</a> - is that fix not in 8.09.1? Does it hit in 8.09.2?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phip</strong> on 13 Jan 2010, 22:57)</p>
