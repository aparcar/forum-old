					<p>Hello all<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I need to configure an Asus WL-500g with White Russian for an working environment to limit bandwidth. I have installed the white russian but the QoS options are limited... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you please help me make a script for limiting a group of ip&#039;s ( eg. 192.168.0.10 - 192.168.0.50&nbsp; and 192.168.0.120 -&nbsp; 192.168.0.200 ) like:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ports&nbsp; 1000 - 65000&nbsp; &nbsp;DL 64 Kbs UP 64 Kbs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ports&nbsp; 80, 81, 443, 21, 22&nbsp; &lt; 512 KB&nbsp; &nbsp;no limit&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ports&nbsp; 80, 81, 443, 21, 22&nbsp; &gt; 512 KB&nbsp; &nbsp;DL 64 Kbs UP 64 Kbs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is for the employees that need internet access but I want to limit the video streaming web sites (like youtube...), internet radio(from winamp and others) and big downloads and so on&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And for users like manager, director... there should be no limitation...</p><p>thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>hi, </p><p>why do you use white russian? I would recommend backfire! the package qos-scripts is really powerfull and has just one configfile. <br />It works really great for me (at least with kernel 2.6, am not sure about 2.4). </p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/qos">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/qos</a></p><p>you can classify and reclassify traffic by ip-address, ports, size,... and combinations of all of them <br />so set all traffic you don&#039;t want to &quot;bulk&quot;. This should do the trick. <br />You wouldn&#039;t have an hardcoded bandwithlimit for this type of traffic, but it has a low priority so if any other traffic needs the bandwith it will get it. (which is a much better approach) <br />You can also set the priority of (time-)critical applications like voip to express or priority. But you shouldn&#039;t set the traffic of special users (regardless of how &quot;special&quot; they might be) to priority or express, because this would probably mess up everthing. Just set the traffic you don&#039;t want/need to bulk. </p><p>In my case I get this result: bulk traffic can use up to ~90% of the bandwith if no other traffic is present, but if traffic with a higher priority needs the bandwith the bulk traffic gets only up to 20%.</p><p>I would recommend only editing the configfile, and test it. if this doesn&#039;t satisfy your needs, you can think about messing with the scripts but then you really need to know what you are doing. you need to have knowledge about iptables and qos-algorithms.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not a big fan of the concept of dealing with social problems by technical solutions (restrictions). So my first suggestion would be this: tell your managers, directores... that if they treat their employees like adults there may be the chance that they would act like adults.</p><p>but if you are looking for a technical solution, you should add <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option limitrate xx</code></pre></div><p>to the definiton of the class &quot;Bulk&quot; in /etc/config/qos <br />you can set the limitrate as percentage of the linespeed (the upload- and download-values you set for your wan interface in the qos-configfile).</p><p>I&#039;m not sure but in my qos-config I found this definitons: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config class &quot;Normal&quot;                
        option packetsize  1500   
        option packetdelay 100
        option avgrate     10        
        option priority    5     
config class &quot;Normal_down&quot;        
        option avgrate     20</code></pre></div><p>so I guess it should be possible to add a &quot;Bulk_down&quot;-config with a different limitrate, if you need this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just curious that what kind of backfire build you are using. The qos script on 10.03.1 rc4 seems fine. But qos and iptables on trunk has problem. The difference is that 10.03.1 rc4 uses 2.6.32.16 kernel and the current trunk uses 2.6.35.9.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>watermark</strong> on 14 Jan 2011, 20:10)</p>

					<p>you can filter per ip/ip-range with the option srchost, dsthost <br />you can specify an ipaddress (optional with an corresponding netmask if you want to filter a subnet e.g. 192.168.1.0/24)<br />You probably need two rules one where you specify only the dsthost and one where you specify only the srchost </p><p>to the pkgsize: I think your rule only matches packages with exactly 512 Bytes. </p><p>If you want a range you have to do it like this: min:max<br />512:1000 for packages between 512 and 1000<br />512: for packages bigger than 512<br />:512 or 0:512 or -512 for packages smaller than 512.</p><p>and you can specify &quot;srcports&quot; and &quot;dstports&quot; separatly. </p><p>the wiki for qos isn&#039;t complete you can check the /usr/lib/qos/generate.sh for all options.</p><p>btw. I&#039;m not sure that all this streamingservices are only http-traffic (e.g. rtmp://, mms://,... are on different ports) and even if they are http-traffic they might be on another ports, too. maybe you should think about level7-filtering</p>									</div>
