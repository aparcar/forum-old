					<p>Can anybody please explain what is the &quot;blessed&quot; repo for packages (I am on 7.09). There is a <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages-mipsel/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ /packages/</a> which has a date of July 13 2007, but it has a lot of packages for example, I found subversion there). Then there is <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/packages/mipsel">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/packages/mipsel</a> that is dated September 30, 2007 but is smaller (at least subversion is missing there.</p><p>Now I am reading about this directory that is both new (Oct 6) and full (or at least svn is there <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. Is this just the mirror of what is hosted on openwrt.org (built from snapshot of the sources)? But I am reading that asterisk worked from one repo, and didn&#039;t work from another. Is it just because the sources were borked at the time of &quot;that&quot; build?</p><p>Obviously, I am utterly confused. Can somebody describe the process that openwrt team goes through when posting the packages. What is the preferred repo for packages?</p><p>Thanks, and sorry if this is documented somewhere. I tried to find and couldn&#039;t</p>									</div>
