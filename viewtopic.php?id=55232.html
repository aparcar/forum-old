					<p>Hey everybody, i just googled hours and hours to find a solution, but i dont get it to work, so i thought i&#039;ll post it here and see if somebody can help me out.</p><p>I have one router (T-Com W724V) for every device in my house with WPA2 encryption and i have a Netgear WNR2200 with OpenWRT Barrier Breaker installed (connected to a VPN), which should be connected in Client Mode to the W724V. When the W724V is encrypted with WEP, everything is working just fine, i have another master network configured on the Netgear WNR2200 and the VPN is working.</p><p>When switching my W724V to WPA2 encryption and reconfiguring the Netgear, the connection seems to work for a few seconds before breaking up and then just loops, it connects, disconnects, connects, disconnects, .. </p><p>everything on the Netgear is configured via LuCi.</p><p>is there any workaround for that problem?</p><p>thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Your problem looks similar to something a experienced some time ago. At least if you are trying to run WPA (not sure why WEP is working).<br />So maybe my input helps. <br />Did you configure a specific channel on both routers, and is it the same? <br />I had the channel set to auto, and the main router tried to get away from the master-network on the client-router (because of it, the channel seemed crowded). So you have to configure the channel manually and the same channel on every interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Next step might be creating only the STA-interface on your client and no Master and try if it works. Connect a client to an ethernet-interface of your clientrouter, and check it out. Just to figure out if it&#039;s a problem between&nbsp; the W724V and your openwrt-box, or if the problem is only on your openwrt-box between the STA- and Master-Interface. </p><p>Then configure both STA- and AP-Interface again and post your configfiles and logfiles<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/config/network

					<p>sorry, i should have said this in the first post.</p><p>when trying to connect the netgear with wpa2, i cant even configure a master network on the netgear, so it has to be a problem between the w724v and the netgear</p>									</div>
