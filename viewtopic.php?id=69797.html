					<p>It is, but I suggest you use the LEDE 17.01 RC&nbsp; images, which are far more up to date:</p><p><a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.0-rc2/targets/ramips/mt7621/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/rele â€¦ ps/mt7621/</a></p><p>Those include the web interface as well. I have a DIR-860L B1 myself and I&#039;m very happy with it.</p>									</div>
