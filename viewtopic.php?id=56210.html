					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to compile a package for Linksys WRT54GL/Backfire 10.03.1/brcm-2.4.<br />I need to fix that packet ( RIP routing for BIRD ), and can&#039;t use another OpenWRT version because of WRT54GL limitations.<br />However, when I launch make menuconfig, there is no bcm 2-4 target.<br />I tried pulling from git an older openwrt package, but I then get lots of errors ( prereq-non-root failed, prereq-build failed, .. I triple-checked. Nothing was ever done root )</p><p>Should I reflash my WRT54GL with Backfire 10.03.1 brcm47xx, and try compiling with the target BCM47xx ? Is it ARM or MIPS ?</p><p>Backfire 10.03.1 brcm47xx for WRT54GL is labeled as &#039; works, somewhat unstable &#039;. Should that worry me ?</p><p>Or should I give up, and wait to have some money to buy a new router ( like a TPlink WDR 3600/4300 ) ?</p><p>I really need a working RIPv2/RIPng router, for a RIP/BGP lab.</p><p>Thanks for any help ^^</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ZenNetwork</strong> on 11 Mar 2015, 15:48)</p>

					<p>My own experience is that the toolchain for 10.03.1/brcm-2.4 is broken.<br />I failed to compile simple c-programs with it, but using a later toolchain (12.09) worked. That is, both compilation and running the program worked.</p><p>I suggest you try to use &quot;everything&quot; from 12.09 and just innocently install to 10.03.1.</p>									</div>
