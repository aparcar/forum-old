					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m writing this post with the hope to &quot;sensibilize&quot; openwrt users and developers to spend more effort on long distance link optimization. Let&#039;s me explain.</p><p>Five years ago I made my first long distance link. The link is 4.1 km, so it&#039;s not so long, but I live in a rural site with no DSL service (and no hope to have it soon, that&#039;s Italy!) and so I use it to bring DSL connection, and I need to have the maximum possible throughput.</p><p>At first time I used two WRT-54GL, replaced times later with the optimum WHR-HP-G54 (one of the best cheap hardware with very powerfull rf txpower), two 24 db grid antenna. As firmware I used first sveasoft (I know, it&#039;s closed, but it was the only firmware having the most recent wireless drivers for broadcom) and then dd-wrt. With this hardware/software configuration, using channel 14 (in Europe is not legal, but it&#039;s the only real clear channel), fixed rate and shortslot_override I&#039;m able to have a real throughput of 1.2 MB/s with fixed low latency of 1-2 ms and rssi of -68.</p><p>Later I made a second long distance link of 3.5 km (yeah, it&#039;s not so long also this), in this case using a couple of Uibuiquiti NanoBridge 5 GHz 22 db, with OpenWRT (trunk compiled by myself, in the meanwhile I abbandoned dd-wrt for the normal routing operation, preferring openwrt). In this scenario, with a rssi of -74 I have a stable link and a real throughput of 3 MB/s.</p><p>So, two weeks ago, I replaced my old 2.4 link with a new one 5 Ghz. First using Ubiquiti NanoBridge 5 Ghz 25 db (despite of distance I need high gain due of some trees in the los) and then, because of the low received signal (-83), two Rocket M 5 Ghz and two RocketDish 30 db. This is the final rssi</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>     LinkName XX:XX:XX:62:35:AB -74 dBm -95 dBm 52.0 Mbit/s, MCS 11, 20MHz 39.0 Mbit/s, MCS 10, 20MHz

This test tell that in this particular scenario openwrt is not mature for long distance link, and I have to use airOS, with regret. I hope that will be spent more effort on long distance link, as well as created a dedicated section for ldl on the forum.</p><p>Then I have a last question, that i know has already been discussed but the final response is not clear to me: I&#039;m in Italy, I can use channel 13 of 2.4 Ghz here. Why I&#039;m unable to use it, except of using hack methods?</p><p>Thanks in advance<br />FunMan</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear eeff11,</p><p>i&#039;m not glad to say that is a firmware (openwrt in this case, the firmware that normally I use) problem, but this is the truth. Not a general firmware issue, simply airOS has some optimization for long distance link that openwrt didn&#039;t.</p><p>I&#039;m not a beginner in ldl, all you say is correct, but you must consider that antennas position is the same (fixed) between the two test case, and only changing the firmware from openwrt to airos I have different results (same as rssi, different for throughput, 700 kb/s with openwrt and 3 MB/s with airos).</p><p>FunMan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FunMan</strong> on 30 Jul 2013, 18:45)</p>

					<p>If you have ubnt device and do not anything extra, stick with AirOS, it&#039;s way faster and perfectly stable. AirOS has some scripting support too, but openwrt has much more possibilities at the cost of lower throughput, higher latency and buggy wifi <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Although I&#039;m almost a year late to the discussion, I wanted to second FunMan&#039;s original idea of paying more attention to Long Distance Links (LDLs) using OpenWRT.</p><p>I have been trying to set up a 5-mile encrypted link with OpenWRT on Ubiquiti gear and have, so far, been unsuccessful. I know plenty about radios, antennae, Fresnel zones, and all that electromagnetic stuff - all that&#039;s fine, but I can&#039;t get the software to actually pass data across the link.</p><p>I appreciate the suggestion of using dtim_period and noscan, although it&#039;s not entirely clear how they&#039;d help if there&#039;s no link currently.</p><p>Unfortunately, testing this is difficult: I have a good 5-mile testing range, but I can&#039;t run a test there in less than half a day, and it takes at least 20 minutes to go from one end of the range to the other (mountaintops: great for Fresnel zone, usually crummy for access).</p><p>I&#039;d love to help figure out LDLs in OpenWRT. There may need to be changes to the software, or it may just need a Wiki page, but I think it&#039;s an important thing to get done.</p><p>All assistance will be met with gratitude.</p><p>-Bill</p>									</div>
