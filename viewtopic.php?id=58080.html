					<p>Hi:</p><p>Looking for a tech who might be interested in receiving MikroTik RB750GL routers (brand new) (running RouterOS) and replacing this with OpenWRT.</p><p>We can do this work, but it is time-consuming.<br />We have the steps documented for the most part and can repeat as needed.</p><p>We would rather spend time doing other things, and hand this task over to a vendor.</p><p>Again, take stock MikroTik RB750GL (no wifi) routers (brand new) running RouterOS, and replace/rebuild the router to use OpenWRT.<br />Ship the routers back to us when done (will ship 3-4 at a time to you).</p><p>Thanks for your interest, and we will be waiting for a reply.</p><p>Shawn</p>									</div>

					<p>You should probably indicate your location as shipping costs will vary depending on where you are located in relation to any prospective vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would be interested as this is a very simple task (I&#039;ve done it on my own RB750GL).</p>									</div>

					<p>We are in California.</p><p>We would ship you the routers.<br />We would ask for qty = 2-4 at a time to be worked on.<br />We would start with one as a sample run to confirm the process works for both of us.<br />You would do the work (and) ship back using our Fed-Ex account.</p><p>We would need your details (phone and email).<br />We would pay via PayPal.com to keep things flowing.</p><p>Shawn</p>									</div>
