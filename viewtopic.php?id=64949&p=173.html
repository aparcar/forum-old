					<p>When using 160Mhz width, this is what I&#039;m finding in the logs. My wife who works from home is finding some intermittent issues with wifi on this setting. I&#039;ve asked her to start telling me exactly when it happens and see if it correlates to the logs below. The issue I see is that 160mhz over laps with I want to say 40mhz of DFS spectrum, and when radar is detected, the below log is created. </p><p>Sat Dec 16 08:52:50 2017 kern.info kernel: [45274.343332] ieee80211 phy0: radar detected by firmware<br />Sat Dec 16 08:52:50 2017 daemon.notice hostapd: wlan0: DFS-RADAR-DETECTED freq=5500 ht_enabled=0 chan_offset=0 chan_width=5 cf1=5570 cf2=0<br />Sat Dec 16 08:52:50 2017 daemon.notice hostapd: hostapd_dfs_start_channel_switch: no DFS channels left, waiting for NOP to finish<br />Sat Dec 16 08:52:50 2017 daemon.notice hostapd: wlan1: DFS-RADAR-DETECTED freq=5500 ht_enabled=0 chan_offset=0 chan_width=5 cf1=5570 cf2=0</p><p>*EDIT*<br />In the last 20 minutes I&#039;ve seen it bounce to 2 different channels... Of course no matter what channel it chooses there will be some or all DFS spectrum. The issue I&#039;ve had since the V1 is that radar is detected no matter the DFS channel selected, so I imagine it&#039;s going to bounce around changing channels all day.&nbsp; That&#039;s probably the intermittent issue my wife is experiencing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 16 Dec 2017, 17:10)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m still dealing with 160mhz width for supposed &quot;Tri-band&quot; configuration.

					<p>Bad news for V1 owners, the build process for kernel 4.4 dies at the same point as before... Something about image-armada-388-clearfog-pro.dtb failed. I&#039;ll continue to look at the possibilities. </p><p>My immediate recommendation would be to buy a new/used or refurbished 1900acs or 3200acm. Good deals can be had on ebay, but you have to stay patient and snipe the deal at the closing seconds. That may not be an option for everyone, and highly recommend pushing the LEDE developers to fix the issue, so your unit is not left behind. </p><p>Also, though it doesn&#039;t work for everyone, try disabling IPV6 as others have suggesting in previous posts and see if it works for your unit. The idea has come up to disable certain modules in the V1 which will lead to a hotter running unit. I&#039;m hesitant of doing so because as a previous V1 owner I remember how hot that unit used to get, and creating more heat on the cpu may not be good in the long run. However, this issue is still active, and there may be other solutions yet to be put on the table that will fix this issue once and for all, so all hope is not lost. </p><p>I appreciate all the comments, and though I can&#039;t respond to everyone, as usual, I appreciate other contributors, in this thread, who step up and answer questions every day of the week.</p><p>Best Regards,</p>									</div>

All releases ultimately fail with a reboot within 48 hours. No error logging occurs at the time of the reboot. The router is not heavily loaded.<br />Kernel version 4.4 has run rock solid on same WRT1900ACv1 for many months without errors.<br />I compiled new kernel 4.9.65 last week with “CPU IDLE” and “CPUFREQ SCALING” both disabled in kernel config. Router has been now running for over 8 days now without reboots or errors.<br />Today I have recompiled a new kernel with “CPUFREQ SCALING” re-enabled and left CPU_IDLE still disabled in kernel config. Will test for one week to see the results. I will report back.<br />Based on some anecdotal evidence, I’m speculating that the problem may arise when the CPU is coming out of an IDLE state. On a couple of occasions my router was pretty much idle when I logged into LUCI. As soon as LUCI started, the router rebooted.<br />The Marvell doc shows the Armada XP CPU has 3 possible states (IDLE, DEEP IDLE, and SLEEP) Each progressive state is more power efficient but will take longer to restart. I’m not sure which state we are actually using in this 4.9 kernel. Maybe someone could give us some insight how this all works.<br />Thanks much.&quot;</p><p>It would appear that the reboot bug has some considerable issue COMING OUT OF <strong>CPU IDLE</strong> STATE according to the LEDE thread...&nbsp; &nbsp;:0</p>									</div>
