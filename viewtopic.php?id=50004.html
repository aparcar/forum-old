					<p>I got a TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v7 with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1) and Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3.8.</p><p>I have been using it for 4 months and I didnt had a problem while I was under win7. I have some computers, tablets and smartphones, and all of them are connected to the same router. So, I configured a QoS to give some prioritys and to have a stable connection. It was working very well, every single device was detected by the router and I could configure them without problems.</p><p>A week ago I installed Win8 and since then the router doesnt detect my computer. I have internet, but since the router doesnt detect my computer, the QoS isnt working well with this connection in particular, I have some lags when I play videogames online or the internet is going slower than usual. I have configured everything in Win8 as Win7 but I dont find my dispositive in the router interface.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tDNAw42.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/tDNAw42.jpg" /></span></p><p>Here two devices are detected by the router. One if them is a smartphone and the other is a tablet. Both of them are connected to the network by Wifi, but my computer doesnt appear and its connected by wire. I searched in the System log and the mac of the computer doesnt even appear, so is like the computer wasnt connected but I got internet connection.</p><p>Can it be a bug with Win8? I haven&#039;t seen anything like this.</p><p>PS: Sorry for my spelling mistakes. English is not my primary language.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>am3fak</strong> on 10 Apr 2014, 17:42)</p>
