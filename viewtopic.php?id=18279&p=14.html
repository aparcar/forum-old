					<p>I just want to post a reply here as this was the most visible forum for this router, WNR2000V3.</p><p>The primary issue is that the trunk .img file has &quot;WNR3000V3&quot; as it&#039;s &quot;device:&quot; string in the file header.</p><p>I have found that the original WNR2000V3 firmware images from Netgear have &quot;wnr3000v3&quot; as their device strings.</p><p>I tried to change the characters from upper case to lower case, but it looks like there&#039;s some checksum validations that are failing.</p><p>Can someone make the new truck image with &quot;wnr3000v2&quot; instead of &quot;WNR3000V2&quot;?</p><p>Also, if there&#039;s a known fix for this, please let me know.

					<p>yes</p><p>I have the wnr2000v3 and wnr2000v4 the v3 I updated to OpenWRT through the web interface but the v4 i had to unlock the telnet it was a lot harder.The only builds for the v1 are the TRUNK builds and the trunk builds does not come with the LUCI but you can do a OPKG update and in stall it.I used this to unlock the telnet but it is for the newer version but it is almost the same you will need the older telnet unlocker the rest should be the same except for user name and password.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH7CWTylX5I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH7CWTylX5I</a></p><p>if you brick it, it does have a recovery mode.</p><p><a href="http://www.linuxmediaserver.net/linux-basics/bricked-router/">http://www.linuxmediaserver.net/linux-b … ed-router/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ckm</strong> on 17 Oct 2016, 13:17)</p>

					<p>Well, I finally am talking to my WNR200V1 router on the W7 machine.&nbsp; If it will help anyone else, I had to do the following for this miracle to transpire :&gt;)&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>1 - Enable the telnet and TFTP clients in Windows 7 (not enabled by default)... </p><p>2 - Downloaded and installed PuTTY for windows</p><p>3 - Followed the instructions on the OpenWRT Unlocking the Netgear Telnet Console for Original TelnetEnable for Windows </p><p>4 - Downloaded the Netgear telnetEnable.exe utility</p><p>So now I am going follow radengr&#039;s post #148 back on page 6 for upgrading the WMR2000V1 router. </p><p>I&#039;ve read all the posts in this thread at least twice and I know that there are some other images (trunk builds and/or generic builds?) that have worked or will work on a V1 but I&#039;ll give those some thought later.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for a conventional and safe approach here now.</p><p>I do have a question first though...</p><p>If I understand it right, the snarf command will download the needed files into the /tmp directory and then they will be read as upgrade proceeds.&nbsp; </p><p>I already have the four image files downloaded and wonder if I can&#039;t just copy the files into the /tmp directory and not run the snarf commands, just start with the files in place and issue the mtd commands?&nbsp; </p><p>These are the files I will use:</p><p>ubootenv-stockpartitions.img<br />u-boot.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-ap81-rootfs-squashfs.bin mtd2<br />openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-lzma.bin mtd4</p><p>Any suggestions or warnings of impending disaster are appreciated, and thanks for the help and you patience so far...</p><p>Jack</p>									</div>

					<p>Never mind my question about uploading the files to the router instead of using the snarf command.&nbsp; </p><p>I had no idea how difficult that would be for me to do and I found a working source where I can snarf them from.&nbsp; The u-boot.bin and ubootenv-stockpartitions.img files are still available for download from here:&nbsp; </p><p><a href="http://www.simcop2387.info/wnr2000/">http://www.simcop2387.info/wnr2000/</a></p><p>My thanks to simcop2387!&nbsp; </p><p>The earlier links for those files were no longer working, that is what made me think up the dumb idea that it might be a good idea to upload them instead.&nbsp; </p><p>So tomorrow morning we will have a moment of truth on this... </p><p>Jack</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jackerbes</strong> on 20 Oct 2016, 03:53)</p>

					<p>Well I guess this is the end of things for me...&nbsp; </p><p>I followed through the steps in the radengr post on flashing the WNR2000V1</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=163661#p163661">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 61#p163661</a></p><p>and when I got to the end and it gave it the reboot command the router powered off (even though the power button was still On), the PuTTY telnet session closed itself and that was the end of the news...&nbsp; </p><p>I gave it some time, 30 minutes or so, and it will not power back up or show any signs of life with resets after power cycling, resets, or 30-30-30 resets.&nbsp; </p><p>So I think this router is dead, not bricked.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had changed the paths on the snarf commands but otherwise just followed that post.&nbsp; But if it will not power up it is probably beyond saving, no?&nbsp; </p><p>I think I&#039;m losing interest in Netgear routers...&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Jack</p>									</div>
