					<p>I would like to share my internet connection through a Wifidog hotspot -- outside clients need completely unencrypted wireless connections.&nbsp; My home network already uses WPA encryption and I want my home to remain secure.&nbsp; Of course, I can&#039;t string a wire through my whole apartment, so I need to WDS connect a couple WRT54GL boxes.</p><p>My question is whether/how I can configure WDS between OpenWRT boxes whose AP clients require different encryption.&nbsp; Note that I wouldn&#039;t really care whether the WDS connection is encrypted.&nbsp; I think this ascii diagram will clarify what I am thinking:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>                 SECURE              UNSECURE
