					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have been using custom-written script and using HTB to limit incoming and outgoing transfers from/to various IP addesses. i was allowed to assign multiple IP addresses to single class, thus limiting all of them, as in HTB limit was laid on class, not on IP.</p><p>Actually I have 100/50mbps and I use both IPv4 and IPv6.

For testing set the shaping rates such that the sum of ingress and egress does not exceed 60 Mbps (then the shaper at least has a dance of working as expected, albeit slow)<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>belliash wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I heard about qos-scripts and sqm-scripts.

					<p>@moeller0: Thank you very much for your response.<br />I was using this QOS rules on my TpLink WDR4300 and they worked quiet good. Recently I have migrated mi config to WRT1900AC (DualCore 1.2GHz ARM). So I suspec its not related to CPU power, especially that I dont see load on this router.<br />When I set limit to 50mbps, then I get around 45mbps. If i set the limit to 100mbps then I got only ~65mbps. If I increase the limit to 150mbps then it serves around 90mbps. <br />On my previous router (TPLink) I got ~10-11MiB/s, what gives around 80-90mbps. All my QOS rules have been migrated. I dont understand why more powerful router gives around 30mbps lower transfers...</p>									</div>
