					<p>I have two questions. Pleas keep in mind I get overwhelmed by too much info at once, due to A.D.H.D., and I like short steps to keep me focused...</p><p>*EDIT* I forgot to mention I have OpenWRT White Russian 0.9 on a Linksys WRT54GS Wireless router. The configs are basically stock, save for some firewall port forwarding, and the WebIf^2 install I did.</p><p>1) Is it possible to set up a fallback route, where if one computer is down, the router will then forward the ports to an alternate computer?</p><p>My specific setup is that I have two servers running identical servies which are mirror images of each other. The reason I have two is so that I can have a backup should the first fail. The problem is that I currently have to change the port forwarding to the second server&#039;s IP manually to get packets from the WAN through. Having a secondary server isn&#039;t much use if I have to change router settings every time my primary server crashes, especially since it usually happens when I&#039;m not around.</p><p>2) This has been plaguing me for a while and I know the answer is floating around in probably a million places, but I can&#039;t find it. Anyways I don&#039;t feel bad about starting a topic on this, as this is just a secondary issue, not the main one (#1). How do I set it up so that clients within my LAN can access my external address through the WAN, and be routed to specific computer through the firewall, just like someone over the internet would?</p><p>My specific situation here is that I run several websites on my servers, and wish to be able to test the links using my external DNS provider (no-ip.com) which links to my IP, and masks it. The end result is an address along the lines of <a href="http://mysite.mydomain.com">http://mysite.mydomain.com</a>, but since that links to my ip, it means that local clients within my workgroup can&#039;t access anything containing this address, and have to manually enter in <a href="http://192.168.1.xxx">http://192.168.1.xxx</a> to get to the server.</p><p>P.S. Sorry if this has been covered. I&#039;ve tried searching for keywords on the forums, and related topics in the documentation. That and I&#039;m dead tired and quite busy. Then there&#039;s the A.D.H.D...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Pegleggedous</strong> on 30 Jan 2008, 06:15)</p>

					<p>I can help you with your second question.&nbsp; You need to redirect packets from the LAN destined for the WAN&#039;s IP address to go to an internal host.&nbsp; The best place to do this is in the ip-up script.&nbsp; I use PPPoE, so this script is located in:</p><p>/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/firewall.config</p><p>So, here&#039;s how it works (basically a copy-and-paste from my ip-up script):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Determine the WAN address via the ppp interface
WANIP=$(ifconfig ppp0 | grep addr | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | sed &#039;s/addr://&#039;)

# Append the (new) rules to iptables
/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d $WANIP -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to $SERVER_IP
/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d $WANIP -p tcp --dport 22 -j DNAT --to $SERVER_IP</code></pre></div><p>Where $SERVER_IP is the IP address of your server.&nbsp; This does, however, have the distadvantage of not removing the any old redirection rules from iptables, but a scheduled reboot of your router can fix that problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>To answer your question, I don&#039;t think you need to have PPPoE in order for it work.&nbsp; Since I have a PPPoE connection, it was the only thing I decided to research.&nbsp; If you have some other form of DHCP-based internet connection, there is probably an ip-up directory for your internet connection type.</p><p>Now, if you have a static IP address you&#039;ve got it easy.&nbsp; Just add those lines to the /etc/firewall.user file and replace $WANIP with your WAN static IP address, replace $SERVER_IP with your server&#039;s internal IP address, restart the firewall (or reboot the router) and you&#039;re done. </p><p>Of course, you should always try out the commands by running them, from ash before writing them to the firewall.user file, otherwise you might need to recover your router though failsafe (I did that a few times).</p>									</div>
