					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have semi-bricked my wrt54gl v1.1 somehow when setting up kamakaze 7.06.</p><p>Firstly, the tftp bootup wouldn&#039;t work with the stock firmware, so I instaleld the </p><p>firmware using the stockfirmware&#039;s web admin thing - it worked, rebooted.<br />I telneted to the machine on 192.168.1.1, set the admin password and quit telnet.<br />i then ssh&#039;d into the box fine using root/password.</p><p>I edited the /etc/config/network file and changed the ip address from 192.168.1.1 to </p><p>10.0.0.1. and added Option Gateway 10.0.0.5 (which is the main router to the internet)<br />saved the file and dropped back to the prompt.</p><p>now, without thinking I did ifconfig down eth0.0, which as you can imagine killed the </p><p>ssh session.</p><p>I unplugged the power from the router, and plugged it back in, hoping that it&#039;d </p><p>reconnect eth0.0 and would be up and running again.</p><p>Since then I have been unable to connect to the router using IP.<br />-------------</p><p>All four lan ports work fine as a network switch, the wan port if plugged in requests an </p><p>IP from the dhcp server and pings fine - but everything on that IP is firewalled.</p><p>When it boots up it broadcasts 192.168.1.0/24 port 4919 !Press reset now, to enter </p><p>Failsafe!&nbsp; - however, pressing the reset button on the back does nothing at all and it </p><p>will not drop back to failsafe.</p><p>wifi is turned off (I didn&#039;t set this up yet)</p><p>I still can&#039;t use tftp to install a firmware on it, it either times out or gives an </p><p>error saying &quot;Error in recfrom() call.&quot; I have tried this directly plugging the wrt54gl </p><p>into my laptop&#039;s ethernet port and through another switch</p><p>Altho, after the router boots up I do have a record in my arp cache saying that </p><p>192.168.1.1 is the mac address of the router - but I have a feeling that IP is only </p><p>there for about 1/2second because of the amount of trouble getting it to even ping let </p><p>alone getting tftp to do anything but a timeout<br />--------------</p><p>I&#039;m at the end of everything I&#039;ve done so far and not sure what to do next.<br />But I have learnt how to bridge to network cards in WinXP :)</p>									</div>
