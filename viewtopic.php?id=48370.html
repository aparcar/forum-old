					<p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR703N that I deleted the network interfaces from. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Yes, it warned me not to. Yes, I did it anyway. I know it was a stupid thing to do... now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />. The back button on the browser and Ctrl+Z have limited applications. (Yep, tried &#039;em. Multiple times.) Moral of story: don&#039;t delete network interfaces (yeah, I would have thought that was self-explanatory too, except for the fact that I did it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" />).</p><p>OK, so now I have a cute piece of blue and white plastic with a PCB inside that won&#039;t talk to me (or my computer... so much for autoconfigure...). <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /><br />Do I have to buy myself some sort of serial adapter to de-brick it, or is there some way I can do it with a regular Cat 5 patch cable?</p>									</div>
