					<p>Had a hard time finding more information about this binary, just know that it&#039;s run at first boot on initial firmware install to set jffs2 partition to root, so I ran this binary straight without any flags on&nbsp; in hopes of trying to get more information on its utility when bam, it looked like doing so overwrote/re-wrote something as it seemed to indicate it was writing to mtdblocks. </p><p>Now i&#039;m worried about rebooting into a brick. Could it be true that this binary could be so harmful?&nbsp; I have not rebooted yet, and was hoping for guidance whether i will reboot into a brick and whether i can alter such an outcome if such is true.</p>									</div>
