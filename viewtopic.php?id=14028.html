					<p>You have probably bricked the router. As <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GP">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ us/WL500GP</a> mentions, you should make sure the process of flashing is not interrupted. I have no idea if it&#039;s somehow possible to unbrick it, though. I wish you luck in either case <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve seen some people managing to unbrick some of the Linksys routers, but the procedure, if any exists, for Asus routers is surely different. Try searching the forums here, or at <a href="http://wl500g.info">http://wl500g.info</a>/ - really no other ideas that could help you since I didn&#039;t brick my router (yet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ).</p>									</div>

					<p>Try using the Firmware Recovery Utility that comes on the cd that came in the box. You can write any firmware to it with this. Also, if using this utility on Vista, make sure that the lan is set to Private on the Vista side. Or just find an XP box to run Firmware Recovery from.</p><p>After recovery, make sure the thing reboots completely before unplugging it, or you&#039;ll have to do it again.</p>									</div>
