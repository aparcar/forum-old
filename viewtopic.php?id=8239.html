					<p>hi,<br />I have a 512mb flash stick attached to my asus wl-500gx and started vsftpd to have a little fileserver. I made a user bla for ftp usage, I don&#039;t want anybody to know my root pw. Downloading works fine, but I can&#039;t upload. I found out that that bla hasn&#039;t got the rights to write to /mnt/disc0_1 but chmod 777 /mnt/disc0_1 as root does nothing and chown bla /mnt/disc0_1 says operation not permitted. What I did then was creating a directoy named /mnt/test with everyone allowed to do everything ( 777 ) and mounted /dev/discs/disc0/part1 to it. After mounting the rights changed to 755 and owner is root again. and after umounting test bla is the owner again.<br />I&#039;m a bit confused, because even with &quot;mount -o umask=777,uid=0,gid=0 /dev/discs/disc0/part1 /mnt/test&quot; rights are changing to 755 and the owner root.<br />the filesystem of the stick is fat32</p><p>Can you tell me to set the right rights for this flash stick?</p>									</div>

					<p>no one who can help?<br />atm I&#039;ve given bla the uid 0, deactivated bla&#039;s shell and chrooted into /mnt but this is not the best solution. I want bla having the uid 1000 with write access to my usb-devices</p><p>besides the ftp is running fine and I have longer to keep my computer on to share large files with my friends</p>									</div>

					<p>I did everything I was used to do from a usal linux-distro to mount a volume writable by a user, without success, and I did searching a lot but with google. as I see I should&#039;ve wrote gid=1000,uid=1000 but iirc I tried this, too. now I&#039;ve formatted the flash drive with ext3 which works well. I didn&#039;t use jffs2 for the flash drive because I know now from wikipedia that it doesn&#039;t matter which filesystem I use on a flash drive.</p>									</div>
