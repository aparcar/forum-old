					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I built an image for a MR3420v1 which I included some network configuration that seems to have broken IP access to the router (using image builder BB).&nbsp; If I use failsafe mode will the router load with the default configuration that I specified when building the firmware or does it have another set of network configs burned into the image that it will use instead?&nbsp; The failsafe wiki page isn&#039;t exactly clear on this point (I will update when I know the answer).</p><p>The router is remote to my location (600km away) so I don&#039;t know what is happening with the LEDs on the device at the moment however the switch does work as I can talk to other devices connected to the router switch ports, just not the router itself.</p><p>Just wondering what my chances are at being able to recover the device without having to hook up a serial cable.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to be prepared (with appropriate soldering gear etc) for when I go to site next time.</p>									</div>
