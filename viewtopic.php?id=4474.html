					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a &quot;crazy&quot; problem with OpenWRT (White Russian RC4). I have written an application that is transfering data between WAN/LAN and a USBbridge for our sensor network.</p><p>When I start this application manually (via SSH), it runs for hours without problems. But when I start it automaticly at system start (script in /etc/init.d/) or when I plugin the USB device (script in /etc/hotplug.d/usb/), it crashes within a very short period of time. It does not exit via one of the returns in the source code, there seems to be something in the system that stops the application, but I don&#039;t know what?!?</p><p>can anyone help me?</p>									</div>
