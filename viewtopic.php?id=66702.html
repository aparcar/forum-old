					<p>I recently installed Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 on a WRT1900AC router and would like to refine security settings starting with Dropbear. Before making any adjustments, I have a few questions which I hope can be answered by more knowledgeable users. For convenience, I’ve numbered each question to allow numbered responses.</p><p>Q1. Upon visiting the website “https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html”, I noticed a security release was issued for Dropbear on 21 July, 2016, version 2016.74. Based on this release date, I assume the version of Dropbear that shipped with 15.05.1 is without the latest security patch. How can I confirm the version of Dropbear I’m running and what steps should I take to update to the latest security release, should I need it?</p><p>Q2. I would like to enhance the security of my router starting with Dropbear, beyond default settings. The plan is to only administer the router on the LAN side, via ethernet. Setting up and using SSH public key authentication instead of user name and password authentication. I have read the OpenWrt article “Secure your router’s access” and reviewed the router’s administration page “SSH Access” via LuCI, and I believe I understand what each option would result in, whether selected or not, but want to make sure. </p><p>Based on what I just described I would like to achieve, I assume these are the selections I should make within LuCI’s UI.<br /> a. Select interface “Lan” I understand this to mean attempts to access port 22 from the WAN would be ignored.<br /> b. Keep selected “Allow SSH password authentication”<br /> c. Deselect “Allow the root user to login with password”<br /> d. And of course add the public generated key within the section “SSH-Keys”</p><p>Q3. Lastly the OpenWrt article “Secure your router’s access” suggests having Dropbear listen on a random port greater than 1023. Choosing a nonstandard port for a degree of added security makes sense, but are there any downsides or problems which could arise by choosing a port other than the standard port 22?</p>									</div>
