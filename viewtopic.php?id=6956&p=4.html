					<p>The only path that is in the script for now is the path to the config files, that is pointing to the default installation (/etc/asterisk). Actually it must be changed manualy on top of the script. If the defaults are not used, an exported path have to be added to the system (or hard-coded in the script) to make the asterisk binary available from the command line, as it can be done with a telnet.</p><p>The script is very simple and is usefull to have some &quot;quick looks&quot; to endpoints softwares, hardwares or operators, look at open asterisk chanels and modify the .conf files. Other manual commands can be run from frontend but it&#039;s not really &quot;managing&quot; the PBX.</p><p>I will work with you with pleasure on your &quot;x-wrt&quot; site if some enhancements are necessary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drwho</strong> on 23 Oct 2006, 13:48)</p>
