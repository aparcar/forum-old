					<p>Fix what?<br />* The log messages? (while leaving everything running?) You probably need to patch odhcpd sources for that (and then compile a private version odhcpd).<br />* Disable odchpd (if you do not need ipv6 addresses)? It is one service among others.

					<p>Just speculating, but it _may_ be a warning because it is issuing ULA (Unique Local Addresses) which are not routable.
