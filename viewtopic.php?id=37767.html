					<p>Codel looks like it might be the best thing since sliced bread, as a solution to bufferbloat. I know it&#039;s in openwrt trunk, which is great. I have yet to find how to turn it on, though. Is it running by default, or does it need to be turned on with a tc command?</p><p>The internets seem to be gushing over codel, but after googling for a while, I still haven&#039;t found how to flip the switch and turn it on in a Linux computer or openwrt router. (I know it&#039;s only in trunk in openwrt, and kernel 3.5 of Linux. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s a module that has to be loaded in tc or iptables.)</p><p>~J Bennett</p>									</div>

					<p>codel is the innovative new queuing and drop strategy. fq_codel is generally what you want however, which does fair queueing on top of codel. It is a successor to sfqred, with multiple nice enhancements over sfq, red, and drr that are looking pretty wonderful. </p><p>It is still early days though! It&#039;s not every decade where a networking paper gets published and the code written in 7 days and slammed into the mainline kernel!<br />We are working out some thorny details on the codel mailing list and you are welcome to join us there. </p><p>There are caveats as yet, I listed a few of them here: <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/503777/">http://lwn.net/Articles/503777/</a></p><p>The codel sub-wiki has pointers to the paper, sims, and code for linux 3.3-3.5, as well as binary packages for cerowrt, fedora, and ubuntu.</p><p>openwrt presently uses fq_codel in the qos-scripts, turning it on by default for ethernet is under discussion. </p><p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki</a></p>									</div>
