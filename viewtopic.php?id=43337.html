					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to enable 5GHz mode for radio0 on a TP-Link WDR-3500. Radio0 runs off the AR9344 SoC and Radio1 runs off the an AR9582. I&#039;m running Barrier Breaker R36195.</p><p>I was trying to modify some values in the ath9k driver&#039;s eeprom_def.c file by creating a patch and putting it in target/linux/ar71xx/patches-3.8. However, using printk()&#039;s I noticed that none of my changes are showing up when I flash the machine. dmesg doesn&#039;t show any of my output.</p><p>After compiling I checked under build_dir/target-*/linux-ar71xx_generic/linux-3.8.3/drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k and found that these files are indeed getting patched with my printk() statements. Somehow it seems that my code isn&#039;t ending up in the compiled ath9k.ko kernel module. </p><p>I haven&#039;t been able to figure out why my changes are not working. I&#039;m at a loss. Does anybody know what I could be doing wrong? I&#039;ll be glad to supply any information I may have left out.</p><p>Thank You.</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you sure that kernel tree driver was used ? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Check build_dir/target-*/linux-ar71xx_generic/compat-wireless-*/drivers/net/wireless/ath<br />I think you need apply patches to&nbsp; package/mac80211.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, apparently I tried over 70 times to apply the patch to the wrong directory. This was over 28 hours of banging my head against a wall.</p><p>I only needed to apply my patch in package/mac80211/patches and it worked.</p><p>You Sir, are my hero. </p><p>Thank You!!!</p>									</div>
