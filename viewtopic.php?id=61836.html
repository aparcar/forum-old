					<p>Hi to the openwrt community,</p><p>I use openwrt no for about a year and I am very happy with it.</p><p>Now I wanted to switch the last DDWRT device to openwrt, my main router.</p><p>My setup is like that:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.gruber.info/topology.png" alt="my networt setup" /></span></p><p>So I use routed subnets with static routes on the main router which does all the NAT to the internet.</p><p>When using DD-WRT at my main router all works flawless.</p><p>When I switch to openwrt I have issues with portforwarding. I can access a forwarded port to Server1 (not in a subnet). If I add a forwarded port on the main router which points to Server2, it cannot be accessed, not from external and also not from internal (via external URL).</p><p>A client in the same net than Server1 can access the internet perfectly fine. But a client in a subnet (like server2) has problems with DNS. DNS resolution takes about 4 seconds.</p><p>I have made my basic configuration like a normal NAT router and then I used the guide at:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#using_routing">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ro â€¦ ng_routing</a></p><p>When I switch back the main router to DD-WRT all works like it should.</p><p>What could be the reason? How can I proceed with analysis? I have some external services running, so I cannot do tests for a long time. At least I have 2 different devices so I can just exchange them if I need to test something.</p><p>One note, when I did my DD-WRT setup, it was necessary to add the following to my firewall to make that work:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o `get_wanface` -j SNAT --to `nvram get wan_ipaddr`</code></pre></div><p>Could this be somehow responsible and if yes how can I do that in openwrt?</p><p>Hope someone can help me.</p><p>BR,<br />Andreas</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems I have solved my issues, first thing is NAT reflection. When NAT reflection is enabled for a portforwarding, the SRC net for SNAT and DNAT postrouting rule is created like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A -s 192.168.34.0/24 -d 192.168.33.251/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m comment --comment &quot;Forward234 (reflection)&quot; -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.34.254
iptables -A -s 192.168.34.0/24 -d $WANIP/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 234 -m comment --comment &quot;Forward234 (reflection)&quot; -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.33.251:22</code></pre></div><p>To change this I have added the following to my firewall.user:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables-save &gt; /tmp/ipt.txt
sed -r -i -- &#039;s/-s 192.168.*.0\/24/-s 192.168.0.0\/16/g&#039; /tmp/ipt.txt
iptables-restore &lt; /tmp/ipt.txt</code></pre></div><p>Dont know if this is a bug or not. But would be great to somehow configure the SRC for the reflection rule.</p><p>As for the DNS issues I misconfigured some things, I get lots of errors like:<br />dnsmasq[15886]: Maximum number of concurrent DNS queries reached (max: 150)</p><p>Will try to find the misconfiguration.</p><p>BR</p>									</div>
