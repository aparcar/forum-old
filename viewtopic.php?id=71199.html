					<p>I have a wr1043nd v2 router with Chaos Calmer and 3 antennas. <br />I succesfully set it as repeater.<br />The &quot;to be repeated&quot; wifi network has a poor signal. <br />I&#039;d like to set one of the 3 antennas to be the only one that communicates with this wifi net, so that I can improve signal through an extension cable and put this antenna outside my window.<br />How can I do that?<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately, in the standard configuration the signal comes too low from the external wifi source (the one I need to repeat).</p><p>So I tried to disable 2 antennas and kept active only one. I put an extention cable on the active antenna, put it outside my house and put also a Cylindrical Parabolic on it directed to the wifi source. The signal improves very much, but in this scenario the repeated wifi is not working inside my house (because the only antenna is outside and oriented in the wrong direction due to the parabolic).<br />So I would like to have one antenna talking with the wifi source and another different antenna talking with my devices.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think, the best way is to install another router behind the tp-link, so you can setup a complete new wifi network with a different channel and so on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I guess that&#039;s, basically, a general problem with repeating: As long as you don&#039;t go for uni directional antennas, you&#039;ll always increase the covered area a little bit.<br />Think about one AP as covering 100%, that&#039;s a circle around the AP. <br />The second AP needs to be within the covered circle of the first AP, which results in the first AP being within the covered circle of the first AP as well.<br />This means the area between both AP is covered twice and the 1-dimensional increase (maximum distance between two clients in your covered area) gets increased from 2*radius to only 3*radius because 1*radius is just covering an already covered area.</p><p>Ofc. that&#039;s not completely true since you aren&#039;t moving 1-dimensional and signal strength decreases with distance, so there are situations where wifi repeating is more beneficial than that.</p><p>And since I admit to be strongly against repeating wifi over the very same wifi channel it gets served in the first place, you clearly need consider which parts of my explanation you take for granted and what you&#039;re investigating yourself.</p><p>My first suggestion would be: Don&#039;t do wifi repeating but use an rj45 cable to connect both APs. That&#039;s most probably the best in terms of coverage, AP distance and signal interference you can get.</p><p>My second option would be: If you really need to use a wifi connection between those APs, don&#039;t use your primary antennas. Either plug in additional USB radios coming with their own antennas or even -- as &quot;rj-45&quot; suggested -- use completely distinct access points for that. </p><p>My third hint would be: If you have both, 2.4GHz and 5GHz in one device, you can dedicate the 5GHz as link between those radios and not use it for clients and dedicate the 2.4GHZ for clients only and not use it for AP link. Which clearly means: Step either back to second option and plug an additional radio into your 1043 or get a new device entirely.</p><p>Advice &quot;three point one&quot;: If you cannot separate 2.4GHz for one link and 5GHz for another, at least use different frequencies. Use e.g. channel 1 on 2.4GHz for clients on AP1, channel 5 on 2.4GHz for clients on AP2 and channel 9 on 2.4GHz for connecting both APs. The later one is the tricky part because it requires to have both APs two times the 2.4GHz radio hardware, so you need to add an USB radio per AP.</p><p>Keep in mind that whatever you do on your secondary AP must be complemented on the primary AP. Go for 2.4GHz for clients and not using 2.4GHz for inter AP linking on both sides, and use only 5GHz for inter AP linking and not for clients on both APs as well.</p><p>My next advice would be: Use unidirectional antennas. On both APs. And have a close look on which antenna you can replace and which not. There&#039;s a ton of devices out there that has external antennas for 5GHz only and provides 2.4GHz via purely internal antennas. </p><p>As a general thing: Don&#039;t mix up radios and antennas. Your 1043 has three external antennas but only one radio for 2.4GHz. You simply can&#039;t dedicate one antenna for the &quot;wifi client uplink to primary AP&quot; and use the other two antennas for everything else. You can influence (to a certain degree) how the antennas are used in terms of beam forming and sending/receiving, but that&#039;s a general thing to be set up on the hardware wifi adapter you have. There&#039;s no way to have that configured for one SSID in one way and for another SSID in another. If you want that, get yourself another radio. So you&#039;re back to adding an additional USB wifi interface.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>What happens if you simply use a default setup and replace one of the antennas with the high gain one, leaving the other two attached and active?&nbsp; You should not have to turn off the other antennas to make it able to receive from the distant AP on your parabolic.&nbsp; There is one &quot;radio&quot; but it has three &quot;chains&quot; which process the signal from each antenna separately.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 12 Jun 2017, 17:44)</p>

					<p>Can you suggest a USB wifi interface that works fine with the 1043 and it is cheap?</p><p>I am not sure that an high gain antenna would work. I&#039;ve extended one antenna with a 5 mt cable to get closer to the original signal ... and it doesn&#039; work fine as expected.</p>									</div>
