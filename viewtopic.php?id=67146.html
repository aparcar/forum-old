					<p>Hi all, I have set up WPA2 Enterprise authentication to work nicely with my Wi-Fi devices, but I haven&#039;t found a way to do it for wired machines (hosts that connect to my router with an ethernet cable). Ubuntu has the capability built right in to the NetworkManager for wired connections and can be done with the same methods (EAP-TLS, etc.) as well.</p><p>So can anybody help or give suggestions on a way to get OpenWRT to talk to the Freeradius server and authenticate hosts with a wired connection?</p>									</div>
