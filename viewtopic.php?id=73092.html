					<p>Rigth now it looks like &quot;procd&quot; always executes everything inside &quot;/etc/rc.d/&quot; in &quot;the same way&quot; (ie. there is just one way to boot).</p><p>I would like to boot in one way or another (different network configuration, different services spawned, ...) depending on the value of a GPIO.</p><p>What would the &quot;correct&quot; way to do this be?</p><p>One option would be to modify all the scripts inside &quot;/etc/init.d&quot; so that they all check the GPIO value and, based on that, decide to exit immediately or start using one configuration or another. However this seems &quot;dirty&quot;.</p><p>Can you think of a better way? I could maybe modify &quot;procd&quot; to, instead of directly executing the contents of &quot; /etc/rc.d&quot;, call first a script whose output is the actual folder to execute (ex: the script would read the GPIO value and return &quot;/etc/rc.d&quot; -normal boot- or, maybe, &quot;/etc/rc2.d&quot; -special boot-).</p><p>Any other ideas would be greatly appreciated :)</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wolander4</strong> on 26 Jan 2018, 19:27)</p>
