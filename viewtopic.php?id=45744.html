					<p>Hey,<br />I am rather new to OpenWRT and have steered myself into a corner I can&#039;t get out of.<br />What I WANTED to do is change my router&#039;s firmware in order to have it establish a VPN connection, either via OpenVPN or PPTP.</p><p>What happened is, that first I flashed Gargoyle, but the GUI would never accept my OpenVPN settings and eventually I installed pure OpenWrt 12.09 and LUCI.<br />Since some Gargoyle stuff was still messing with my settings I installed again, this time without preserving the settings.</p><p>Afterwards I was successfull in reacing the Netgear via 192.168.1.1. And THEN I did something stupid. My Modemrouter is configured as 192.168.0.1 and instead of bridging the connection and setting manually a firm IP like 192.168.0.2 in the Netgear router I selected DHCP as connection method.</p><p>Since then I can&#039;t reach the Netgear at all. I&#039;ve tried everything I could possibly think of, but I simple cannot reach the router.....</p><p>Here&#039;s what I know:<br />When connected to the Modem, the Netgear receives the IP 192.168.0.20<br />When I try via LAN or WLAN to open that IP-Adress it&#039;s not reachable.<br />When I connect via LAN to the Netgear the LAN LED is orange and I don&#039;t receive<br />and IP on my laptop.<br />When I try to connect via WLAN to the Netgear (SSID is visible when scanning!) I can&#039;t establish a connection, even when I set a fixed IP like 192.168.0.21 and gateway 0.1. or 0.20<br />When I unplug everything an connect only Laptop to Netgear via LAN the LAN LED is<br />green, but I also don&#039;t receive an IP and setting one manually doesn&#039;t help either.<br />Last but not least, resetting the Netgear with the 30/30/30 method results in a bliking Power LED (software corrupt) switching off and on again results in a normal boot and the Netgear<br />again receives 192.168.0.20 from my Modem.</p><p>Anyone have any ideas how I can gain access to the Netgear Router again?<br />The Model is WMDRMACV2, but it is almost identical to the WMDR3800.</p>									</div>

					<p>some further research and trial and error eventually resulted in bootloader mode (hold reset for 30s until power LED is slowly blinking) and then TFTP the OpenWRT Firmware to 192.168.1.1. </p><p>Now I am back on the GUI, yeah!<br />I have some more questions now regarding setup of a VPN, but I will read some more first before posting.....</p>									</div>
