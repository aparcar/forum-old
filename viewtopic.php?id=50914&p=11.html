					<p>I have a WNDR 3700v1. Hi I have been using your build for a while and I am now have an issue with your 41663 build, probably user error, but I have been trying for over 4 hours to fix. My ip addresses are all on 192.168.2.x. I cannot change the router default ip to 192.168.2.1, once I do I am no longer able to access using luci interface - says cannot be reached (I can ping the router, have internet access on all machines). I have tried changing the ip in LAN, WAN, Alias one at a time and then all together. I was able to get back access by copying the config folder from a previous older backup into your newest build. What could I be doing wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I&#039;m hoping someone can help me.&nbsp; I have a problem regarding DDNS updates.&nbsp; I have Hughesnet Gen4 for ISP.&nbsp; They do not offer public IPv4 addresses, everything goes through their NAT.&nbsp; They do have native IPv6 though.&nbsp; I have an DDNS account at dnsexit.com.</p><p>I don&#039;t think the&nbsp; /usr/lib/ddns/dynamic_dns_updater.sh script is handling IPv6 correctly.&nbsp; In /etc/config/ddns I have the following selections; option ip_source &#039;network&#039;, option ip_network &#039;wan6&#039;.</p><p>When I run the script manually, no IP address is dispalyed as the script runs.&nbsp; dnsexit.com, if it does not receive an address, uses the address reported to it by http, which in my case turns out to be the IPv4 address of the NAT.&nbsp; If I select &#039;wan&#039; instead of &#039;wan6&#039;, the script will display and send the IPv4 address, yet again its changed by the ISP NAT.</p><p>I don&#039;t know how to write scripts and I&#039;m not very good at reading them.&nbsp; Could someone tell me specifically what I need to do, to have the script send my current public IPv6 (2001:) address?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for this awesome firmware! I fiddled around with OpenVPN in the past but never could it get to work like I wanted it to, now it does. Going on vacation to the US soon, so using open hotspots finally will be safe.</p><p>One request which I would understand if you won&#039;t do, could you add NFS support in the base FW? That would be very nice and since it takes a bit more packets to install than Samba (that one is just one packet) it would really make things easier when upgrading and a clean installation is needed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 22 Jul 2014, 09:48)</p>
