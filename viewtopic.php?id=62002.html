					<p>Some ISP&#039;s impose monthly usage limits.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d like to see how well their usage claims track with what OpenWRT says my wan interface moved per month.&nbsp; &nbsp;To that end I installed collectd and the luci statistics pkg.&nbsp; &nbsp;That works quite will for showing the bytes/sec graphs of the interfaces but nowhere can I see how to display the bytes moved this month.&nbsp; &nbsp;It looks like collectd is collecting all the needed info, I just can&#039;t see how to display it.&nbsp; &nbsp;If worse comes to worse, I could just do it myself.&nbsp; I did find the if_octets.rrd file in the rrd directory tree which most likely is some time vs. octet count file.&nbsp; I just need to figure out the format.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m just surprised that there isn&#039;t already a pkg to do that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wolfgang.rupprecht</strong> on 7 Jan 2016, 00:08)</p>

					<p>Typically, bandwidth is monitored using snmp. You can install snmp by the following command #opkg intall snmpd</p><p>The issue is that you need to have a collection station (PC) to poll the router for the stats you want. Then after a month you can create your own reports from the collection station.</p><p>Anyhow, collectd is fine and all, but I am not aware of how long those stats are kept.</p>									</div>
