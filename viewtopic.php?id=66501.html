					<p>Hi,<br />I want to start hacking on the Huawei HG633. I don&#039;t think its SoC is supported by OpenWRT yet so my chance of failure is pretty high, but I&#039;ll give it a try. Any advice/help from the community would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve got so far:</p><p><span class="bbu">Serial</span><br />I&#039;ve opened the case and got a USART connection to the board. I get a nice bootlog <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/huawei/hg633">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/huawei/hg633</a><br />Autoboot can be stopped at two points:<br />1. VER5610 bootrom (within 1 second of applying power). This gives a &#039;bootrom &gt;&#039; prompt. Any one have any commands for this prompt?<br />2. Hi-Boot bootloader (a couple of seconds after applying power). This give a &#039;Hi #&#039; prompt. Again, any commands? It responds to &#039;tftp&#039;.</p><p>There doesn&#039;t seem to be a command shell at the end of the full boot.</p><p><span class="bbu">Flash memory</span><br />The device uses an SPI flash memory chip. I&#039;ll try and desolder it and take a full backup with flashrom. I&#039;ll also remove the EMI shields.</p><p><span class="bbu">SDK</span><br />Huawei haven&#039;t been very helpful in responding to my GPL requests. I found an opensource package on their website (linked on the wiki). Couldn&#039;t see a compiler in there though.<br />I found a few references littered throughout the opensource code package referring to &#039;arm-hsan-linux-uclibcgnueabi&#039; e.g. &quot;/home/luokunling/open-HG633/BR-R5-HG633HG658v2-20140408/output/host/usr/bin/arm-hsan-linux-uclibcgnueabi-gcc&quot;</p><p>I&#039;m not so familiar with crosscompiling but I managed to find an &#039;arm-hsan-linux-uclibcgnueabi&#039; compiler for a different router (<a href="https://github.com/Stricted/DT_Hybrid_GPL/">https://github.com/Stricted/DT_Hybrid_GPL/</a>), will this actually produce executable code for this router?</p><p>What should I try next?<br />Thanks for the support!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still trying to get a correctly packed squashfs.<br />Firstly I needed to include the &#039;-no-xattrs&#039; switch when building my version of squashfs.</p><p>Secondly, I&#039;ve looked into the original squashfs in detail. In particular, I examined each .xz compression block of the squashfs. I can see that the md5sum of each of the .xz compression blocks matches ones of the .xz compression blocks of my own squashfs. This indicates that the files of my squashfs are being combined correctly but in a different order to the original squashfs.<br />There is an option in mksquashfs to do this, the &#039;-sort&#039; option.<br />Therefore, I&#039;m trying to make an appropriate list of files with the correct ordering for mksquashfs for use with the &#039;sort&#039; option.</p><p>Still plugging away at it but no look yet.</p><p>If I get chance I&#039;ll also have a play with the tftp option in the bootloader.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good tip on wireshark. Will take a look.<br />The &quot;Hi-Boot&quot; bootloader lets you load in firmware images through two methods:<br />1. A webpage hosted at 192.168.0.100<br />2. Via tftp from a server at 192.168.0.10</p><p>This seems common to other Huawei routers.<br />Hoping to look into both options.</p><p>I didn&#039;t mention using this as a cable modem. It&#039;s an ADSL modem (no cable modem) but I don&#039;t expect to get the DSL part working - didn&#039;t see any source code for it in the opensource package.</p>									</div>
