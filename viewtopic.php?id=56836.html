					<p>Hopefully I&#039;m posting in the correct area...</p><p>So I bought the router listed in the subject and was using the following instructions to get OpenWrt installed but I&#039;m running into an issue.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd</a></p><p>Basically, I following these instructions:</p><p>Installing via web interface:<br />Download image for your version: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ x/generic/</a><br />Log in to router web interface and select the firmware image you just uploaded as an update<br />Sit and wait while it flashes. It will reboot and be accessible at 192.168.1.1.</p><p>The last part is where I&#039;m having the issue. When I attempt to access the router with 192.168.1.1 it gives me the webpage is not accessible.</p><p>This is the first time I&#039;ve trying installing OpenWrt or any kind of custom firmware on a router so I&#039;m a newb.</p><p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>codeghost</strong> on 14 Apr 2015, 17:43)</p>

					<p>Make sure your PC&#039;s ethernet port is set for DHCP (&quot;Obtain IP Address Automatically&quot; in windows).&nbsp; When you connect it should show the router gave your PC an address in the 192.168.1.x range.&nbsp; A new flash of OpenWRT starts with wifi disabled.&nbsp; You will have to connect by ethernet.</p>									</div>
