					<p>Hi, I have cable modem and I&#039;d like to be capable of restarting it remotely. Is there some cheap and easy way to turn device off? I noticed, when I run ifdown, the ethernet light on modem turns off. If I&#039;d have usb on router, I could use usb power and transistor to control power for the modem (15V/1A), but I do not have usb. What whould you suggest? I don&#039;t worry soldering some home made solution.</p><p>Cable modem is cisco and does have GUI on 192.168.100.1, but as soon as it connects, it is no longer reachable on that IP, so I can&#039;t reboot it via curl/wget.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 22 Dec 2013, 15:26)</p>

					<p>But it&#039;s rs 232 only (which my router does not have too) and a bit too expensive, I don&#039;t need 8 relays. I have thought about some $10 thingie from deal extreme, or making something from a few parts. I&#039;d like to avoid opening the router.</p><p>If I do ifdown, ethernet port loses power, maybe this could be utilised by some transistor, I don&#039;t know.</p>									</div>

					<p>well if you want a $10 thingy, you have to solder some parts together yourself (probably).<br />I would go with a cheap optocoupler a transistor and some resistors and hook it up to a led on the router (or replace it).<br />Also you have to put the relay in series with your modem adapter.<br />Something along the lines of this:<br /><a href="http://forums.labjack.com/uploads/monthly_03_2012/post-14464-1332008071.jpg"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.labjack.com/forums/uploads/monthly_03_2012/post-14464-1332008071_thumb.jpg" alt="http://www.labjack.com/forums/uploads/monthly_03_2012/post-14464-1332008071_thumb.jpg" /></span></a><br />(not my drawing).</p><p>After looking trough dx.com you could also go with this one: <a href="http://dx.com/p/jtron-1-channel-opto-isolated-relay-module-isolation-module-black-270934">http://dx.com/p/jtron-1-channel-opto-is … ack-270934</a><br />It needs 5volts to switch the relay, so you could leach that of an usb port. (or other source).</p><p>----edit-----<br />Also you could try to assign an ip in the 192.168.100.x range and see if you still can reach the thing.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config alias &#039;outofband&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option interface &#039;wan&#039;
        option ipaddr &#039;192.168.100.10&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>You create a second interface for your wan port, and the dhcp would still work on the first interface.<br />This way you should still be able to connect to the cisco iirc.<br />If you also want to reach it from the rest of the network, you have to add it into the lan or wan zone (preferable the lan zone, since it is local).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 23 Dec 2013, 16:10)</p>

					<p>Thank you, that dx thing looks great, but it won&#039;t be that easy, I can&#039;t simply rely on the led, because it blinks also when there&#039;s activity, there would have to be some timer and work only when led is off for longer than a second or so, it should not swith the relay as soon as the led blinks. So it would be too complicated. I will probably need some ethernet controlled relay, I have seen one sold here for about $20, but I don&#039;t remeber what was it&#039;s name.</p><p>Setting two IPs on the interface I have tested yet, to avoid I have something wrong I even set static ip to 192.168.100.x range, but the router does not listen on 192.168.100.1 anymore when it is connected.</p><p>Thank you for kind help though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well an ethernet controlled relay wouldn&#039;t be under 10 dollars <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> far from it.</p><p>But what you could do is resassign the led to be constant on (when the ethernet port is up), (via uci or luci) or just dereference it under uci and write some cleverish scripts under hotplug on openwrt</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 24 Dec 2013, 02:22)</p>
