					<p>Yes, I am running a 2.6 image, interesting that the command is not present there...&nbsp; Since I can&#039;t break into the CFE, I suppose I&#039;ll have to install a different image.</p><p>Bummer.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, that was a big pain in the ass, but it worked.&nbsp; Ended up losing my configs but managed to install 7.0.9 to do the nvram stuff, and now have the latest snapshot installed.&nbsp; I opened a bug report to see about getting the nvram command back in on the 2.6 kernel, but it looks like that isn&#039;t going to happen for some reason.</p><p>Is there any other method of setting nvram variables?&nbsp; In my case, not being able to break into CFE was a major hurdle (works now, since I&#039;ve set the boot_wait)...</p>									</div>
