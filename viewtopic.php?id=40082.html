					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a TP-Link MR3420 router. A few weekes ago, I installed OpenWRT (LuCi) and everithing went fine. After tweaking a few setting (couple of days later), I somehow managed to lock myself out of it (and it not to work anymore).</p><p>I&#039;ve tryed the soft-button reset first, no luck (with both buttons, the &quot;reset&quot; and the &quot;QSS&quot; on the front). Also tryed connecting to the first lan and wan ports, still nothing.</p><p>Finally, I&#039;ve built a serial cable (from a Nokia cable), and I am connecting through PuTTY to the router, BUT: the console is not responding, at all. The rooter seems to boot, but at some point it stops at the line: &quot;Enabling watchdog timer&quot;. Connecting and disconnecting ethernat cables to its ports seem to have an effect in the console (some messages), so I know it&#039;s still running.</p><p>But I can&#039;t seem to press the &quot;f and ENTER&quot; keys right during boot. Is it because PuTTY (and I should try a more advance console in Linux), or is there something else?</p><p>Please help, i&quot;ve been trying to revive it for a moth now.</p>									</div>
