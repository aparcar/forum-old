					<p>I have an ASUS Router ( WL-520g ) with a 2mb Flash, as a result, I was only able to use Whiterussian 0.9 Micro Version, and it works great, is stable and I have not had an ounce of problems in over 2 weeks of using Whiterussian on the Router.</p><p>However, as I am using the Micro version, I have no access to an admin console.&nbsp; Is there any way I can password protect my wireless network?</p><p>WPA/WEP I really dont mind, as long as there is some sort of password protection.</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Christopher</p>									</div>
