					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;d like to build an image with the mwifiex driver for my Dreamplug.</p><p>The only entry I found to enable this driver is in the kernel_menuconfig (device drivers-&gt;Network device support-&gt;Wireless LAN-&gt;Marvell Wifi-Ex Driver).<br />When I activate this option and run make. It generates mwifiex.ko and mwifiex_sdio.ko in the Linux/driver/net/wireless/mwifiex build directory. <br />These modules aren&#039;t included in my image but I can download them then load (insmod) later on.</p><p>But these modules don&#039;t work. <br />Looking at source code, I understand is that my problem is due to and incompatibility between this Linux pristine driver and the Compat-wireless tools.</p><p>If I am correct, the only thing I have to do is to build this mwifiex from compat-wireless and not from the kernel.<br />But I did not find how to do this. mwifiex sources are present in my compact-wireless build tree (compat-wireless-2012-06-14) but I don&#039;t find where to activate it.<br />I suppose it should be somewhere in menuconfig-&gt;Kernel Modules-&gt; Wireless drivers, but never found there or anywhere else!</p><p>I&#039;m using a trunk of backfire (r32613).</p><p>Does anyone knows how to compile this driver from compat-wireless.</p><p>Thanks by advance for any hint.</p><p>Christophe</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Christophe,</p><p>did you finally manage it?</p><p>I&#039;m struggling with my Guruplug server running Deb 7.0. My wireless firmware mwifiex_sdio&nbsp; (14.66.9.p96) doesn&#039;t provide the uap interface, hence I&#039;m not able to use it as an access point.</p><p>Any hint or advice appreciated - wgk</p>									</div>
