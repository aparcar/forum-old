					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m thinking of buying either the WDR3600 or the WR1043ND from TP-Link. I was recently using a special Router that was shipped by my ISP, but I changed my ISP and only have an old WRT54GL now, which needs to get replaced. I&#039;ve read a lot of good reviews about the 1043 in combination with openwrt, but since the 3600 is only 20â‚¬ more (in Germany), I now can&#039;t decide which one to buy. Is openwrt for the 3600 as stable as on the 1043? The improved WLAN speed would be great, since I&#039;ll be doing backups over WLAN quite often.<br />Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>
