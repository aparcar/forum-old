					<p>I have a kemp loadmaster 2200 that id like to repurpose into a router.<br />It has a Celeron 1.5Ghz CPU, 1 GB RAM, 4x intel phy ethernet, and a CompactFlash interface for boot medium.</p><p>PFSense works very well in this hardware. I use the 4GB vga console disk image and it boots without a hitch.</p><p>I want to use openwrt, but I cant get it to work, it seems that USB keyboards stop working mid-boot. Grub loads and I can use the keyboard to select normal or failsafe, but once it tries to boot, it becomes unresponsive to key strokes, but if i remove the usb and replug it, the console sees the new usb device.</p><p>I just flashed the x86 generic combined ext4 img and it seems to look like i flashed it right, what am i doing wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>You need a kernel driver, which I think is kmod-usb-hid.&nbsp; This is not included in the generic image.&nbsp; Use the telnet, ssh, or web interface from another computer to log in and install it.</p>									</div>
