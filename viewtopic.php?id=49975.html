					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>I ported an open source application layer firewall called Zorp to OpenWRT and I would like to create a test environment to ensure it&#039;s functionality. After git push there should be an automatic build and then some end-to-end tests, but I stuck on the build phase.</p><p>The Zorp package builds fine on my computer, but, I want to use Travis CI to build the package, because Zorp&#039;s other projects are in Travis also.<br />The catch in this, that it has a 50 minute build limit, so I can&#039;t build the whole OpenWRT from source.<br />I thought the SDK is made for this kind of job, so I tried the prebuilt SDK&#039;s and my own builds, but all of them fails with the same error.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make[3]: i486-openwrt-linux-uclibc-gcc: Command not found</code></pre></div><p>I also tried with other architecture, but it still doesn&#039;t find the toolchain gcc. I even inserted it&#039;s directory to PATH but no luck.</p><p>The process is simple<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Travis downloads the SDK</p></li><li><p>Extracts it</p></li><li><p>Upgrades feeds list</p></li><li><p>Installs Zorp</p></li><li><p>Downloads .config</p></li><li><p>make</p></li></ol><p>The difference with Travis and my computer, that in Travis it doesn&#039;t run &#039;make menuconfig&#039;, so that&#039;s why I upload a .config file and try to use that, but it still can&#039;t find the gcc. </p><p>Anyone has an idea, how to make the SDK find the toolchain compiler?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Peter</p>									</div>
