					<p>Hi,<br />I just played around with the idea to offload the motion detection for MJPG-streamer to the clients.</p><p>Instead of performing the motion detection on the potentially weak router, I would like to use the connected client and his web-browser. In order to have a simple to deploy client, I decided to try JavaScript (currently relies on Firefox &gt;= 3.0.5) and its canvas element.</p><p>I wrote down my findings in a pdf file, hosted at: <a href="http://mjpg-streamer.wiki.sourceforge.net/space/showimage/Distributed+Computing+and+Image+Processing+in+JavaScript.pdf">http://mjpg-streamer.wiki.sourceforge.n â€¦ Script.pdf</a></p><p>Have phun,<br />Tom</p>									</div>
