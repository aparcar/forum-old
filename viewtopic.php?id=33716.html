					<p>I have a Linksys WRT350n v2 running backfire 10.03. This device has 8MB flash memory (4MB remains after the openwrt install) and 32MB RAM.<br />For torrents I installed transmission wich downloads to a 250GB external HDD attached to the USB2 port. To manage the downloads I use the webUI (also available in the repo&#039;s) and transdroid for my android phone.<br />The only problem I had was a shortage of RAM memory when downloading large files (larger than 2-4GB). Creating a swap file on the external HDD solved this.</p><p>So, basically any router with 8MB or more flash memory and a USB2 port would do the job.<br />You can choose one from here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#supported.hardware.-.router.type">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#suppo â€¦ outer.type</a></p><p>Personally I would recommend the netgear WNDR3700v2 or WNDR3800 -&gt; 16MB flash and 64-128MB RAM (probably no swap file needed).</p>									</div>
