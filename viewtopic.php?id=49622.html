					<p>&gt;Where does nodogsplash save the MAC Adresses that will be written into the firewall? is there a way to access this information?<br />It is stored in RAM and lost when the program finishes. The list can be populated from the TrustedMACList setting on startup.<br />But this probably does not help much.</p><p>&gt;Is there a way tell the second router that the user has already been authenticated at the first router?<br />Your best shot is&nbsp; a central database for that. WifiDog may fit your needs here.</p><p>&gt;Is there any chance to use a repeater without having the user to reauthenticate ?<br />You can probably use a repeater to cover a bigger area.</p><p>If you use one Internet connection for multiple routers you could place one NoDogSplash instance there<br />instead of on every router.</p><p>I hope this helps. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your reply.</p><p>If I understand correctly, we need to use wifidog in order to manage the authentication. With nodogsplash alone, each router will always work independently and not allow my users to &quot;roam&quot; from one router to the news, without beeing kicked out and having to reauthenticate.</p><p>Or is there is way to read out the authorized mac addresses from the ram, so I can work with them in my database and may populate a temporary white list?</p><p>Is this will not be possible and I have to use wifidog, how do I get it to work. The research I have just done, shows that is is quite an older project. At the moment we are running openwrt attitude adjustment 12.09 on the routers, and I am quite happy with the setup. Is there a way to install it on this version? If so, how ;-) </p><p>Thank you so much for your help.</p><p>Best regards.</p>									</div>
