					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT(not even installed). I am trying to find a router with the possibility to implement a VDSL-failover by using&nbsp; an Android phone in tethering mode. </p><br /><p>Does anybody have experience with such a setting? What router would you suggest!</p><p>Thank you very much!</p><p>J oe</p><br /><br /><br /><p>PS<br />If it would not only be possible to use/attach a mobile phone for tethering, but to insert the SIM-cart directly into the router, that would great.<br />As much i do know, this approch is superior than to use an USB-modem-stick, because of firmware-dependencies. As much I do know, e.g. the ZyXEL SBG3600N&nbsp; is one of the few routers supporting that scenario.</p>									</div>

					<p>Any router with USB should do (although some might need an active USB hub to provide enough power for the modem), see the table of hardware: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_all?datasrt=^usb%20ports">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_ â€¦ sb%20ports</a><br />There is also information on the wiki on how to configure such a setup: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/3gdongle">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/3gdongle</a></p>									</div>
