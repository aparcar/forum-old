					<p>I have not checked out your patched aircrack yet but I doubt patching it can help much.<br />I&#039;m guessing this because when using the option --ignore-negative-one it does not function properly at all.<br />The correct solution is patched compat-wireless drivers of course (not just for -1 patch but also ACK patch too).<br />I&#039;ve done it for broadcom adapter before on normal linux, not a problem. My problem is not having a native development environment for my openWRT. If I ever figure out how this toolchain works I&#039;ll post my patches etc.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Why would you ever want to compile natively? It&#039;s slow and given the limited space not practical!</p></blockquote></div><p>a) its easier no learning new tools (I&#039;m getting old and lazy)<br />b) DIR-825 w/ 8GB Flash stick = practical amount of space<br />c) First slackware build was on a P100MHz w/ 32MB RAM, I&#039;m sure this is a step up (we won&#039;t even mention the week it took to download @ 3.2 KB/s). ;P</p>									</div>

					<p>Got a solution...<br />Build your image as normal.<br />After it completes go to: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> backfire/build_dir/linux-ar71xx/compat-wireless-2011-08-26/net/wireless</code></pre></div><p>But replace the ar71xx part with your architecture.<br />Now apply this patch: <a href="http://pastebin.com/TgPqckas">http://pastebin.com/TgPqckas</a>. It goes on the file chan.c which should be the only needed change no matter what card you have.<br />Now delete the file chan.o and re-build the image.<br />You will know it works if you load airodump and DO NOT see on the far right of the status line something like: Channel Locked -1.<br />Hope this helps, GL.</p>									</div>
