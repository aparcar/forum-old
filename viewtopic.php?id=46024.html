					<p>Hello,</p><p>I already have a WiFi network (192.168.1.*) with internet connection. Is it possible to create another WiFi network with IP 192.168.2.*, give my router the IP 192.168.2.254 and make it share the internet connection (NAT?) by forwarding to the modem (192.168.1.254) on the other network? This would be a sort of repeater, but on two networks...<br />The router is a TP-Link TL-WR841ND.</p><br /><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stefa.rossi</strong> on 29 Aug 2013, 14:05)</p>

					<p>Yes, but you will only get about half the bandwidth if you are using the same physical wifi interface for both up-link and lan. You probably would use client mode on the up-link interface, and normal AP mode on the wifi lan interface.</p>									</div>
