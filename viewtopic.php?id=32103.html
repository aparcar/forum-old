					<p>I bricked my router awhile back and only recently got the hardware I needed to open it up and attach a serial connector to it (USB to TTL).</p><p>Anyway, I have a 3.3V, Tx, Rx, and GRD connectors soldered on and I&#039;m trying to access the serial console so that I can erase the nvram and load up the default firmware. Funny thing is that when I opened the router one of the radios was actually not plugged in. I&#039;m pretty disappointed with Linksys for that...</p><br /><p>I am using minicom to do this. From the output of dmesg I can see a ttyUSB0 device on my machine. This is with the router powered on. If I power up, /dev/ttyUSB0 goes away as expected.&nbsp; I&#039;m using the settings that are described in almost every wiki that I could find (baudrate 115200, no parity, 8bits, 1-bit stop).&nbsp; The trouble is, when I plug in the router and start minicom (or putty) I have to wait for the modem to initialize and I&#039;m guessing that the bootloader is loading before I can see the modem in my terminal emulator. This is my usual ouput:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Welcome to minicom 2.5
