					<p>Err, thanks, I think. Those links assume that one is a Linux expert.

					<p>Hey HooToo,</p><p>Can I ask why you&#039;re locked into OpenWRT? It sounds like you&#039;d prefer to have that problem solved. I don&#039;t have one of those devices, but it appears from this link:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/whr-hp-g300n">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/whr-hp-g300n</a></p><p>that it&#039;s possible to recover using a tftp interface (don&#039;t worry what that means, it&#039;s something that can be explained later). What have you tried to push back into factory or dd-wrt? Did it give any useful output?</p>									</div>

But as my sign-in name here denotes, I have been beaten by HooToo and have two of them bricked when trying to go back. I am not upset by that as I was just using them to try and gain some experience with dd-wt and OpenWrt as at $16 a piece, they were disposable. </p><p>But having bricked them both, I am now antsy about trying to go back with this router, other than using the &quot;Update Firmware&quot; option within OpenWrt and it does not like the dd-wrt or TP-Link stock firmware.</p><p>I have been using dd-wrt for quite some time and I am just more experienced (comfortable) finding my way around in it. I like the look of OpenWrt but just can&#039;&#039;t get the hang of some things With discretion is the better part of valor, I opt for dd-wrt even though the folk here are much more helpful than the dd-wrt forums.</p>									</div>

You can rename it to something else, but that is not going to improve security at all. What you probably read is that you should not use root for your daily tasks on a desktop computer; but there are no daily tasks at OpenWrt, and it is not a desktop OS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I can&#039;t find where I read that yesterday but it was for a dd-wrt or OpenWrt router. I guess they didn&#039;t actually know what they were talking about, or were explaining it poorly. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>I&#039;ll not worry about &quot;root&quot; then.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are concerned take a look at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.secure">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.secure</a> and use certificate based logins as opposed to password based.</p>									</div>
