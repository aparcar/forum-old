					<p>I carelessly unset the nvram variables et0macaddr and et1macaddr, now the router loses response:( I tried to make it in diag mode, but still has not default ip 192.168.1.1, which means I could not even use tftp to reflash the router. Is it dead ?:( Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I just successfully de-brick my wl-500w by a serial console. I am so happy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I want to share my experiences with who are interested in <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> since I have never hacked into a router, even never used soldering so I will go through every details for those newbies like me. Of course, disclaimer comes first, take your own risk <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>The following url is really helpful:<br /><a href="http://www.zacpod.com/?p=13">http://www.zacpod.com/?p=13</a></p><p>Before I start talking about how to connect a serial console. I would say anyone who unfortunately bricked the router and is really afraid of doing it by yourself, should consider requesting a RMA from asus at first. It looks like as long as the warranty is not broken(you didn&#039;t open the router) asus will try to repair it, no matter what you flashed into it---&gt;at least one of my friends who unfortunately bricked it by flashing dd-wrt obtained asus&#039;s service. It costs shipping fee, but I think it is just trivial, especially when you taking into account the fact that buying converter costs some money as well.</p><p>1. You need a TTL---&gt;USB converter. Even tough some articles suggest you to by a TTL---&gt;RS-232 converter you have to understand now fewer and fewer pc have serial port. I bought this:<br /><a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/391">http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/391</a><br />Also you need a soldering kits. These cost about $20 including shipping fee. If you have a electronic market in your neighborhood, perhaps you can shrink your expense.</p><p>Also you need a USB---&gt;micro USB cable for pololu to connect to the PC. A camera cable usually works.</p><p>2. Open the router. There are four screws on the bottom of router, under the rubber feet. Remove the feet with a knife, you may see there is a tag on one of the four screws warning you by opening the router you may break the warranty. This is your last chance to go back:)</p><p>3. After you open the case, you are facing the PCB board. You have two choices: to remove the antennas from the board to take the board out--&gt;This is more convenient for later work. Or just leave the antennas there, because the connectors of the antenna are glued to the net card---and you have to know the connector is really tiny and fragile. Be careful to remove them</p><p>4. There are eight soldering points near the big black capacitor. And a tiny explanation sheet is closed to them. The cons of this board is it doesn&#039;t have the pin head, so you cannot use the jumper wire directly. It is much more convenient to solder from the back of the board---because the black capacitor is really too big. The eight soldering points are actually eight holes but stuffed by soldering tin. You have two choices: to soldering four pin heads into the holes, or if you are not familiar with soldering, like me, can choose solder four wires directly to TX0, RX0, GND, 3.3v. I use LAN cable because it is convenient. Be careful about soldering if this is your first time. You&#039;d better practice several times before you really do something on the board. The soldering points are really close and do not put too much soldering tin on them.</p><p>5. You don&#039;t have to solder&nbsp; the four wires directly to Pololu, because the holes on pololu are actually there. You can simply plug in the cable wire and spin it a few times to fix it. The order is GND&lt;--&gt;GND, TX0&lt;---&gt;RX, RX0&lt;--&gt;TX, 3.3out&lt;--&gt;3.3. Notice that TX is corresponding to RX. But after several experiments, it looks like if you don&#039;t plugin the AC of the router you have to use 5v to fire up the router with serial console. If you plug the router&#039;s AC in, then you don&#039;t have to solder 3.3out at all. </p><p>6. Use minicom to connect to the serial console---&gt; You can use putty but I don&#039;t have windows at hand. Notice that Pololu uses a CP2102 chip, so if you use a self-build kernel you have to make sure it is supported in the kernel---&gt;Device driver---&gt;USB serial---CP210x. Then plugin the cable. Check the device name by dmesg | grep USB, usually /dev/ttyUSB0. Then set the minicom by minicom -s at first. Choose the correct device, and be SURE SURE to disable the flow control. Then you are likely to see the openwrt welcome page:)</p><p>7. In my case, simply nvram set et0macaddr in openwrt doesn&#039;t work because after restart the macaddress is lost again. I have to enter CFE, this is done by <br />a. reboot the router by typing &quot;reboot&quot; command in ash, or simply unplug the AC<br />b. constantly pressing Ctrl+C during the boot process, you have to be very quick to catch the little opportunity. If you see something like</p><p>CFE&gt;</p><p>then you are good to go, nvram set ..., nvram commint, reboot. It is back! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>And one more last thing, for kamikaze, never never touch nvram unless you have a very clear idea what it is----&gt;There is always reason why a nvram variable is set, and simply don&#039;t make yourself be aware of the reason AFTER you brick your router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>Please correct me if I made any mistake, thank <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shallpion</strong> on 19 Feb 2010, 16:45)</p>
