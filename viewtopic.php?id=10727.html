					<p>I previously opened this thread in &quot;Developers only&quot; but i&#039;m switching to Kamikaze now. I&#039;ve added a post to that thread with a link to this one to notify people the discussion is continued here. Hereby I apologise for this naughty dubble post.</p><p>I quote from the previous thread:</p><p>&quot;I have a Linksys WRT54G3G and I&#039;m trying to get a pcmcia card to work with it. The card in this case is a Option GT Fusion+. It has a by operator customized firmware and I&#039;ve been unable to obtain it&#039;s default firmware.</p><p>I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT 0.9 and installed all the required packages I found so far.</p><p>The problem I currently have, occurs directly on card-insertion. From dmesg:</p><p>cs: cb_alloc(bus 2): vendor 0x11ab, device 0x1faa<br />PCI: Failed to allocate resource 0(40010000-40007fff) for 02:00.0<br />PCI: Failed to allocate resource 1(40010000-40007fff) for 02:00.0<br />PCI: Enabling device 02:00.0 (0000 -&gt; 0002)<br />PCI: Failed to allocate resource 0(40010000-40007fff) for 02:00.1<br />PCI: Failed to allocate resource 1(40010000-40007fff) for 02:00.1<br />PCI: Enabling device 02:00.1 (0000 -&gt; 0002)<br />PCI: Enabling device 02:00.2 (0000 -&gt; 0002)&quot;</p><p>(end of quote)</p><p>The resource allocations seem a bit weird to me but then again, while I am a developer, I&#039;ve never allocated even one bit of memory manually. </p><p>On insertion of a old Option GT pcmcia card I get &quot;cs: memory probe 0x40004000-0x40007fff: clean.&quot; in dmesg. Which matches some pcmcia patch. (004-pcmcia_resources.patch =&gt; +include memory 0x40004000-0x40007fff).</p><p>Now don&#039;t shoot me, but I haven&#039;t tried kamikaze yet. I&#039;ll start building it now and try it this afternoon. Still I don&#039;t think the kamikaze build will solve my issue.</p><p>If anyone has some comments on this, please let me know. I&#039;ll keep posting my findings until then. </p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Eric van Blokland</p>									</div>
