					<p>I would like to optimize the Wifi connection range in one of the dorm rooms and I would like to extend the WLAN range. However there is the problem that provided network is with WPA enterprise (I.e. not using PSK, but user(!)/password combination), so simple range extending is not possible. </p><p><span class="bbu">So the Openwrt router should act as client on the provided network and can span a new (simpler) network for private use. </span></p><p><strong>How would I configure this with OpenWrt? Especially what would be the basic &quot;concept&quot; in OpenWrt for this?</strong> </p><p>See below what I did, but some questions I already puzzle about after unsuccessful tries: <br /></p><ul><li><p>How many interfaces (and &quot;which&quot;) do I use?</p></li><li><p>Can they use the same radio device?</p></li><li><p>Do I need to install relayd?</p></li><li><p>Do I need to install the the host client in the WAN zone and the new private network in the LAN zone?</p></li><li><p>Can I do this on the same radio device or are there any special hardware requirements perhaps?</p></li></ul><p>I have tried to use a TP-Link WR841N for this, but with my first tries I was out of luck trying to setup externder configuration against even a simple host PSK network (I&#039;m not currently at final location) <br />I must say I did understand simple IP routing quite well like several years ago, but I&#039;m more or less new to the linux (Openwrt) interfaces concept.</p><p>I saw that WPA enterprise seems to require some special package to be installed, as the standard configuration doesn&#039;t support this. Not as this point yet.</p><p>I tried to join the host network first (using join netwok button in Lucy), and then tried to create a new interface (?) on the same radio device (using new SSID, WPA-PSK and other IP subnet). I put the interfaces to different zones: the client part in WAN, the new network in LAN.<br />However as soon as I try to enable the second interface, the router becomes unresponsive. Did all with Lucy..</p><p>To be honest, I&#039;m not really sure what I am doing here. But I would be very grateful if someone could share some insights here.. Hope this all makes sense.</p>									</div>

					<p>841n v11 or lower only has 4 MB flash.&nbsp; This means you will need to use Image Builder to make a custom image since there isn&#039;t space to install wpad at run time.&nbsp; Remove wpad-mini and probably you will need to remove pppoe etc to make space.</p><p>Once that is done you are setting up a routed client.</p>									</div>
