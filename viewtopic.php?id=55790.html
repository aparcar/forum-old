					<p>Hello,</p><p>I need to make a simple wired router and I thought any router with several ethernet ports would do the job but a line in the Buyer&#039;s guide is bugging me, it says &quot;Do not confuse the number of Ports with the number of NICs.&quot;.</p><p>If I get a router with an integrated ethernet 4 ports switch, will I be able to configure OpenWRT so that port 1 is &quot;on the internet side&quot; while the 3 others are &quot;on the LAN side&quot; ? Or do I have to find a device with a separate &quot;wan&quot; port ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Almost all routers have a managed switch-- which means you can set up VLAN&#039;s and have wan and lan networks share the single CPU NIC port in a multiplexed manner.&nbsp; This is how the factory firmware works on those models that only have one CPU port but offer a &quot;WAN&quot; jack on the back.&nbsp; Usually those have a 5 port switch for the common setup of one WAN and 4 LAN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 16 Feb 2015, 05:35)</p>
