					<p>What is the difference between these 2 kernels?<br />We have metro cards with both types of kernels on them, one crashes all the time - it is running the metro kernel. The other running the generic IXP4xx kernel is up for 21 days currently.</p><p>Is there a way to tell which kernel version you are using from a console prompt?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Ady</p>									</div>

					<p>The board specific version is obtained by taking the generic image and pre-pending the board type. If your boot loader is already sending the proper board type when transferring control to linux, then there should be no difference. Note that if you&#039;ve modified the kernel config file to remove some board targets, the board specific image is still produced and may not work; a <a href="http://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2008-September/003157.html">patch</a> has been submitted to fix this case.</p>									</div>
