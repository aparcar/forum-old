					<p>I&#039;m running Gargoyle Open-WRT on my WNDR3700v2.&nbsp; I was recently forced to update to Barrier Breaker to fix some bugs on the router, and had to reinstall Transmission as a result.&nbsp; </p><p>Well I&#039;ve got Transmission up and running just fine, there&#039;s just one problem - it loses 90% of its settings every time the router reboots.&nbsp; I say 90%, because a lot of the settings are still saved - my entire config file is intact, the default download directory is correct, and the user name and password for the web UI and remote CLI are still there.&nbsp; But the download/upload limits are reset, and most importantly, the <em>entire list of torrents is gone</em>.&nbsp; That never used to happen.&nbsp; Now every time I have to reboot the router, I lose every torrent, whether it was downloading, seeding, or completed.</p><p>Any ideas as to why this is happening?</p>									</div>
