					<p>When playing with different devices in uboot and many restarts I have to repeat some commands after reset of the device. Is there a way to send commands from one console window to an open serial session in second window - this way I could use bash_history and maybe even tab completion for comunicating with uboot and it would make hacking new devices much easier.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s tedious to say the least. Reset button takes me to the breed uboot mod. Normally one needs to add one&#039;s own mac address to the uboot, but here u can enter it : )<br />PS: I&#039;m aware that the menus are in Chinese, and it&#039;s not completely opensource.</p>									</div>
