					<p>Hi there I have posted about this on another topic but didn&#039;t get anywhere so thought it might be best to start a new thread. I am trying to create a list of 3 websites or dns or ips and have all other websites blocked. There is a thread about this over at the dd-wrt forums using iptables ( <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=56588&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0&amp;sid=cc94f6edbcff7f4fd7c2c7feae3d9558">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. â€¦ feae3d9558</a> ) and I was wondering if something similar can be done with openwrt?</p><p>Can this be done via Luci? I have gone into firewall - custom rules and added the following, but it doesn&#039;t seem to do anything...<br /># Set up the chain <br />iptables -N wanout <br />iptables -I FORWARD -i `nvram get lan_ifname` -j wanout<br /># Allow everyone access to these sites <br />iptables -I wanout -d <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">www.bbc.co.uk</a> -j ACCEPT <br />iptables -I wanout -d <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk">www.telegraph.co.uk</a> -j ACCEPT<br /># Everything else gets blocked <br />iptables -A wanout -i `nvram get lan_ifname` -j DROP</p><p>Thanks so much for any help you can provide.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks so much for your reply, I had no idea that was where it should go. I have unticked &quot;enable&quot; on everything else on that table and added the following 4 rules.

					<p>Sorry just those 3. When testing I added a fourth with another websites ip address but then removed it. What is above is what we have, just those 3. But it still won&#039;t let me access the whitelisted site (openwrt.org).

					<p>Do you have any more tips on this? Those are the 3 rules I have but I can&#039;t access the openwrt website (the one that should be accessible). Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there, this seems to be working now for most sites. However I want to whitelist the website jw.org too. However every time I try to find out which ip addresses to whitelist, it gives me a list of four...</p><p>54.191.118.141<br />54.88.155.189<br />54.84.219.225<br />54.191.45.214</p><p>I have whitelisted all of these using the same method mentioned above, but it doesn&#039;t seem to want to let me load the site. Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>designer</strong> on 7 Apr 2016, 17:24)</p>
