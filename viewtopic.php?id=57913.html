					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>First, i would like to say thanks to all OpenWRT&#039;s developpers for your work. We are using it since long years and are plainly satisfied with your firmwares.</p><p>I expose our problem : </p><p>We manage ~50 openWRT routers and we need to upgrade the obsolete hardware model (old asus wl500 gp).</p><p>We have order a new netgear wndr4300 to try Barrier Breaker firmware and try some new features to complete our news needs.</p><p>During some weeks-month, we have made some tests and customized our new image.</p><p>So, we order 5 new netgear wndr4300 to test on some pilots but unfortunately ... we don&#039;t receive wndr4300v1 but v2 ... and, actually, there is no firmware for this version.</p><p>We have asked our retailers but he can&#039;t no more delivers us this router v1.</p><p>As i can see in the forum, it&#039;s not a &quot;new&quot; problem for you, there is lot of post about this subject.</p><p>I can understand it&#039;s not easy for the developper&#039;s to adapt and maintain the firmwares for each version ... of each model ... of each brands ...</p><p>In summary, today, i came to you with some &quot;simple&quot; questions : <br />- Have the developpers a &quot;partnership&quot; with some contructors or some prefered brands and models when developping and testing new firmwares ?<br />- Have you a brand to recommend, who is not releasing new version of each model every 4 month ?<br />- Have you an idea of which model we could orders ? You can found below our requirements :<br />---- Min 8Mb Flash<br />---- Ideally 128Mb Ram<br />---- ideally, easy to backup-deploy image. we have experienced somes troubles when working on nand flash version.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and thank you for your help guys.</p><p>N.B : excuse me for my bad english</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>The TP-Link WDR-3600 is virtually identical hardware to a Netgear WNDR-4300v1 except that it has 8 MB NOR flash instead of 128 MB of NAND.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I do get your problem. Sticking to a certain device but being unable to buy more to scale is quite annoying.</p><p>But honestly: I don&#039;t think there is any consumer grade hardware out there that fits your needs in terms of long term stability.</p><p>Assuming the OpenWRT wiki hardware page is right with release dates: The Netgear WNDR-4300v1 is available since 2012/08 -- that&#039;s nearly three years now.<br />If you expect any hardware to have a 2.5 years stabilization phase and being still available after that, then you clearly need to stay away from cheep consumer class hardware and look out for some professional class stuff.</p><p>Getting four to five years of long term stability from a consumer router manufacturer is pretty unlikely. That&#039;s close to the time it takes an average car manufacturer to release facelift revisions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>I run a couple of TP-Link devices that I bought over time. No problem so far and really cheap stuff for a whole lot of fun.</p><p>The oldest is a TP-Link 1034. It only has 2.4GHz wifi, so that&#039;s the one being kicked is I feel the need for changes.</p><p>Another one is a TP-Link 4300v1. It has 8mb flash, 128mb RAM and both, 2.4GHz and 5GHz wifi.</p><p>Three of them are TP-Link 4900v1. Those have 16mb flash, 128MB RAM and both, 2.5GHz and 5GHz wifi.</p><p>If I was up to buying new stuff, I would go for TP-Link archer c5 currently. There are rumors that c5 and c7 are equally equipped in terms of hardware, so spending extra money for c7 isn&#039;t worth it when running OpenWRT.</p><p>The c5 goes for 70€ here in germany. That&#039;s nearly the price to spend for a Netgear WNDR4300.</p><p>If you can live with some cheap 5€ 8GB usb drives attached (like the Kingston DataTraverler Micro or the Sandisk Cruzer Fit) then you then you clearly get more fun with those.</p><p>I would stick to those, spend a view extra bucks to buy replacement devices right away and forget about three years long term stability of hardware.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Thank you two to take time to answer my question.</p><p>Unfortunately, i suspected your response before i ask my question but was hoping a solution could be found :-)</p><p>I&#039;ll take some infos about the routers you mentionned.</p><p>Is there a way (forum, dev page, rss, news, others) to known when a new router model or version is supported in openwrt, or i must go to on support hardware page to check regularly ?</p><p>Once again, thank you for your help.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>In generally, the new revisions of a supported device are supported if the hardware platform (processor etc.) remains the same.</p><p>But if the platform changes, it is possible that the new platform does not have good support. There is no good way to know if a new revisions is supported, until the first users buy it and try it (or somebody uses FCC data to check the architecture).</p><p>Hardware vendors have an annoying habit to keep the same &quot;device number&quot;, while changing hardware completely. Good example is WNDR3700, (of which I have v1, v2 and WNDR3800):<br />v1 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Atheros AR7161<br />v2 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Atheros AR7161<br />3800&nbsp; Atheros AR7161<br />v3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Broadcom BCM4718A1<br />v4 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Atheros AR9344&nbsp; + NAND<br />v5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; MediaTek MT7621ST</p><p>v1, v2 and 3800 are practically identical and have good support in Openwrt, v3 is completely different, v4 is again similar to v1 but with NAND flash, and finally v5 this year has introduced a third architecture.&nbsp; (v3 and v5 are still unsupported to my knowledge)</p><p>wndr3800 is already a bit old but rather efficient, has 16 MB flash + 128 MB RAM, has really good support in Openwrt and has an easy TFTP recovery mode if something goes wrong. There are several community firmwares for it. e.g. my own wndr3700 series firmware since 2011: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a>. But I am not sure if the device is still available anywhere.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 18 Jun 2015, 12:45)</p>

New versions have become exorbitantly expensive (&gt; USD250), but I have had good luck with used models for &lt; USD40.</p><p>BUT... If you&#039;re starting new, I would recommend a new router.

Good performance, useful for higher speed cable connections, etc.</p><p>You could also check out the Ubiquiti family of routers (also on Amazon) that are meant for widespread deployment (e.g. purchasing many devices at a time, and over time). Great reviews and OpenWrt friendly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 18 Jun 2015, 16:03)</p>
