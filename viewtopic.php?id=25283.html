					<p>hi jow<br />I noticed that you&#039;ve added a patch for the tcpdump. Instead of patching the pppd script and simply invert the interface name so it doesn&#039;t start with a digit (like wan-3g) you&#039;ve patched the tcpdump! Why is that? Have you analyzed why this restriction exist in the tcpdump code? Have you checked all other programs that could have similar restriction?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>flux</strong> on 7 Jul 2010, 15:10)</p>

					<p>Jow, thanks for the tcpdump patch. Personally I find the 3g-wan/ppp-wan convention very useful. It helps a lot when you always know what a device will be named.</p>									</div>
