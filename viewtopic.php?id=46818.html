					<p>Hi,</p><p>i think i bricked my ARV752DPW22. The bootloader isn&#039;t running anymore and i get following message:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ROM VER: 1.0.3

 X
UART</code></pre></div><p>I put the router into UART mode an tried to flash the u-boot.asc and a backup of the original firmware by using cat:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat ARV752DPW22_orig.dump &gt; /dev/ttyUSB0</code></pre></div><p>After the upload is complete the serial console doesn&#039;t show anything. Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks, horst</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Horst,</p><p>check this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=214774#p214774">thread</a>. Maybe your serial interface is not set up correctly? cat would not know. Try minicom with ascii transfer set to &#039;ascii-xfr -nsv&#039;. This should give you maximum control of what and how you send.</p><p>Have you tried the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/lantiq/danube/uboot-lantiq-arv752DPW22_ramboot/u-boot.asc">u-boot.asc from Attitude Adjustment rc1</a>?<br />I did not yet have to debrick my ARV752DPW22, but the nor and brn Images of AA rc1 work well for me.</p><p>For my ARV752DPW I used <a href="http://www.galax.is/files/802/u-boot.asc"> this image</a>. It should work on the ARV752DPW22, too. Both boards are pretty close. They use different switches - so the network is not going to work and you will have to use <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=183315#p183315">ubootwrite.py</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Use the U-Boot for ARV7518PW (they have the same switch configuration) from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/lantiq/uboot-lantiq-arv7518pw_ram/openwrt-lantiq-arv7518pw_ram-u-boot.asc">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … u-boot.asc</a> and then use tftp to upload a working image. The U-Boot images from AA do not have a working network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>snk</strong> on 17 Oct 2013, 10:26)</p>

					<p>I just did this procedure and &quot;ascii-xfr -nsv&quot; gave the right result. In particular I had a console (&quot;screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200<br />&quot;) open when the router was powered off and once it booted and gave me &quot;UART&quot; I did not close the screen session but from a parallel terminal did </p><p>ascii-xfr -nsv u-boot/recovery/openwrt-lantiq-arv7518pw_ram-u-boot.asc &gt;/dev/ttyUSB0</p><p>and waited for it to finish. As soon as it finishes the serial console showed that the router started executing the u-boot. The thing I learned was that there was NO RESET to be done at that point. If I reset the router everything was lost and I had to start again. </p><p>At that point I disconnected the two things (3.3V and the short) that enabled UART because I read somewhere that this could cause problems </p><p>I took my backupped image and did the commands desribed in </p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=214956#p214956">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 56#p214956</a></p><p>but I actually flashed the whole backup image because just to be sure (so it was&nbsp; 0x800000 long and started at 0xb0000000). Actually after the tftp transfer and before the copy I did a checksum:</p><p>crc32 0x81000000 0x800000</p><p>and compared it to the crc32 on my pc just to be sure that everything went fine. </p><p>At that point I reset the router and was as good (and as bad) as new.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>guraltsev</strong> on 2 Mar 2014, 01:53)</p>
