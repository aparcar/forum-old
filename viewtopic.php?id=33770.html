					<p>So it seems my PS3 is busy dying a slow death.&nbsp; Unfortunately I live in the middle of nowhere and there is no PS3 repair service anywhere near me. Not only that but my PS3 is out of warranty. So I&#039;ve decided to just buy a new console once mine does finally kick the bucket.</p><p>If I buy a new PS3 console how do I get one without losing my profile, trophies, DLC, account information, PSHome stuff, games I have downloaded, the Online Pass for all my games, etc.?</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.ps3breakstore.com/ps3-jailbreak-2-buy.html">jailbreak 2</a> <a href="http://www.ps3breakstore.com/buy-jb2-dongle.html">jb 2 ps3</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ps3breakstore.com/true-blue-dongle.html">jb2 true blue</a></p>									</div>
