					<p>Hello friends, I need to establish a clear link between two openwrt router, but I can not. With Barrier Breaker version I&#039;m lost ...<br />At location A, I have the main router DHCP server (192.168.1.1), and an AP cable with OpenWrt (192.168.1.2). At location B, a client mode router with OpenWrt and wiring to the PCs.<br />I need the IP of the PC&#039;s are assigned by the main router (192.168.1.1) but I can not set client bridge would be in DD-WRT. I have read and tried everything but with the settings I want I can not, I have two Tl-WR841N router with version 12.09 and another couple with version 14.07. someone help me? Thank you very much.</p>									</div>
