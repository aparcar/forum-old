					<p>Sysupgrade firmware is for UPGRADE when you already have OpenWRT installed. When you flash from factory - you should use .bin containing word &quot;factory&quot;</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>rey wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>This is some kind of method to install the firmware?<br />I didn&#039;t understand it.</p><p>I was trying flash with sysupgrade file.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes ... This method is for installing from console. You need to SSH to your router and use given commands from the wiki link to install the firmware.<br />Anyway ... Nice to see you found the right solution.</p>									</div>
