					<p>Ok, I think this should be a pretty easy question for anyone that knows their way around routing and iptables.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don&#039;t fit in that category <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I have an adsl modem that provides a telnet interface.&nbsp; Ideally, I would like to access that from my computer directly.&nbsp; The biggest problem is already solved, which is to have access while it&#039;s plugged into the WAN port of my wrtsl54gs (running WR RC5).&nbsp; Following the instructions here: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Access_To_Modem_Configuration">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ac â€¦ figuration</a> I can telnet from OpenWRT into the modem.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why the modem and LAN ports need to be on different networks (I&#039;m using 192.168.1 for the modem and 192.168.0 for my LAN), but I followed the instructions and it works.&nbsp; As a bonus when I try telnetting from my computer it&#039;s silent instead of giving me no route to host.</p><p>So now it&#039;s a firewall issue.&nbsp; I verified that disabling the firewall lets me telnet to the modem.&nbsp; But I can&#039;t find the magic incantation to get iptables to allow me access without disabling the entire firewall.&nbsp; Help would be appreciated.</p><p>Notes:<br />modem IP: 192.168.1.1<br />WAN alias: eth1:1&nbsp; (IP: 192.168.1.10)<br />LAN interface: br0 (I believe that&#039;s the interface covering both wired &amp; wireless, which is what I want)<br />machines on LAN: 192.168.0.xxx</p><p>Anything else that would be useful?</p>									</div>

					<p>I created a new file, /etc/init.d/S52modemroute with the following contents:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

        # Assign a static IP address to the WAN interface
        ifconfig eth1 $WANDEV_IP

        # Create firewall rules
        iptables -A forwarding_rule -d $MODEM_IP -j ACCEPT
        iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d $MODEM_IP -j MASQUERADE
fi</code></pre></div><p>That creates the necessary route to the modem.&nbsp; Make sure you chmod the file too.&nbsp; Of course, try out the iptables rules before creating the file and committing the changes, otherwise you might need to boot the router into safemode to remove the rules.</p>									</div>
