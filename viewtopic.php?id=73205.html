					<p>Hello,</p><p>Recently I have bricked an Archer C20 V1 while trying to load OpenWRt on it using TFTP. The only way to recover it is to directly write the flash using SPI.</p><p>While I have some idea of soldering/desoldering as well as flashign MCUs with hex files, I have not handled a NOR flash yet. The NOR flash in the router is a MX25l6433f 8 Pin SOP. </p><p>While I do not have an SPI device for that kind of chips, what I can do is to write to it using my Raspberry Pi and FlashROM. However, to use FlashROM. first I need the layout file and the ROM file.</p><p>I am guessing that I need to do some manipulation with the OpenWRT bin file to create the ROM file (and the layout data is also probably hidden somewhere inside the bin file), but how? I do not know how either file is organized. Can you pls help?</p>									</div>

					<p>So, you killed your u-boot? In that case, it would be best to recover just that. You should put your u-boot partition information into a layout file and extract a u-boot from a stock firmware file. Then you should only flash this specific region and hope that the end area of your flash did not get overwritten.<br />After that, you can flash whatever firmware via TFTP.</p>									</div>

					<p>NOR flash is relatively simple.&nbsp; Most TP-Links have a bootloader of 128 kbytes followed immediately by the kernel / filesystem image.&nbsp; The last block in the flash is the ART radio data it also has your MAC address and other unit-specific data.&nbsp; Hopefully this is still in the chip because it is unit-specific.</p><p>So first you want to read your chip and archive whatever remains.&nbsp; If you&#039;re building your own programmer, practice with another chip to be sure it can read and write OK.</p><p>Most people are using the CH341A based USB programmers which cost less than $10.</p><p>Obtain a stock firmware from the TP-Link website that has &quot;boot&quot; in the name and remove the first 512 bytes of the file, that is a header.&nbsp; Then flash the rest of the file into your chip starting at address 0.&nbsp; You should be preserving the last 64k.</p>									</div>
