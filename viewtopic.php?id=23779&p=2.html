					<p>I actually have been to the web site before and read a little about it and it sounds like something I might like to learn a little more about but from what little I have read it doesn&#039;t sound like something I could make use of at home (maybe I&#039;m wrong?) and it&#039;s out of my area at work. Also, I added a question about the cable in my last post, you probably didn&#039;t see it.</p>									</div>

Possibly just a bit overboard, but I am a telephony geek and work in telecommunications professionally so it&#039;s fun to me lol. </p><p>I&#039;d be happy to help you get up and running with Asterisk if you need a hand, it can be as simple as complex as you want it to be. There&#039;s no words to describe the feeling you get when you get your phone to ring, or able to contact another person using a high quality codec (like g722) for example. It&#039;s a quite capable system, and I&#039;ve only begun to scratch the surface, been playing with it for just over a year now. So much potential!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow, that&#039;s awesome. I&#039;m not in telecom but have a server/networking background and am always looking for something new to learn. So if I wanted to get started at home with this for a learning project what would you suggest? I only have a single line. Maybe I could start by redirecting the calls of all telemarketers to the number of the local waste management company? I assume I might want to pick up a couple of IP phones as well. Any suggestions? I would also guess QoS would be very important here. Maybe we should start a new thread for this.</p>									</div>

For me, my configuration is based on a WhiteList. In order words, incoming calls whose CIDs don&#039;t match with the ones on the WhiteList will get dropped or a re-order tone. So, when one of my extensions ring, it must be someone whom I already know.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I would also guess QoS would be very important here.</p></blockquote></div><p>QoS is as well important with and/or without an Asterisk PBX system for a VoIP call.</p>									</div>

It focuses on Asterisk version 1.4, but the info is mainly the same for the 1.6 branches as well. </p><p>There are also pre-compiled Asterisk ISO&#039;s that are ready to go as well, one of the most popular is pbxinaflash, <a href="http://www.pbxinaflash.org">http://www.pbxinaflash.org</a>. I roll my own because I&#039;m a Debian addict, and compiling from source is painless if you want to take that route. </p><p>Like mazilo said, doesn&#039;t matter how many (PSTN?) lines you said you had, it is almost infinitely expandable. I talk to a few friends regularly using the SIP protocol, totally bypassing PSTN and it sounds 100 times better than any PSTN call I&#039;ve ever made, plus it&#039;s 100% free in the fact that I am just simply routing packets across the internet. I also have accounts with a few ITSP&#039;s (Internet Telephony Service Provider) and it costs less than 1 cent a minute for a domestic call here in the U.S. Sure, I have a cell phone with unlimited and free long distance, but what fun is that!!?? This is a network I designed, built, and maintain myself so there&#039;s some self gratification to go along with it hehe. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Void Main wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I assume I might want to pick up a couple of IP phones as well. Any suggestions?</p></blockquote></div><p>Stay away from Cisco phones unless you want the headache to accompany it. I have two that are working, one on it&#039;s native SCCP protocol, the other is SIP, but I consider myself lucky in the fact that I had a knowledgeable friend to assist me. Polycom phones are probably the best supported phone as they run native SIP and you won&#039;t have to do much hoop jumping to get them peered to your box. You can also use an ATA, or even to start with, a soft phone like X-Lite for example or anything that speaks SIP or IAX. The aforementioned Asterisk book covers all that. I just picked up a cheap Linksys ATA for use with this project at my office, got it off Ebay for $35. I will probably be replacing one of my Cisco phones in the near future with a Polycom.</p>									</div>
