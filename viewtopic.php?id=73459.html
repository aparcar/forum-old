					<p>When trying to add a few packages, I was surprised to get the error:&nbsp; </p><p>* wfopen: //usr/lib/opkg/info/kmod-usb-ohci.prerm: No space left on device. (for example).&nbsp; </p><p> I thought I had plenty - in fact purchased the TL WDR 4300 because it had ample room, without needing to use extroot.&nbsp; Things in this context (flash, SoC) obviously work differently than what I am used to with physical disks .&nbsp; Can anyone point me to good documentation fo help me understand how storage and partitionaing works with OpenWrt, and why I can&#039;t use the 61 MB tmpfs partition? Or can I? Is there a way to extend root to use some of the 61 MB unused on /tmp? Is there a parted like utility for this purpose?

					<p>The rootfs and overlay are the flash.&nbsp; Rootfs contains the files that are part of the original flash image.&nbsp; Overlay is where packages and other files you add later are stored.&nbsp; There is a total of about 8 MB on that model since that is the size of the flash chip.</p><p>If you erase a package that was in rootfs, it doesn&#039;t reclaim any space in the flash chip.&nbsp; You have to flash a new image that does not contain the package in the first place.</p><p>Tmpfs is in RAM.&nbsp; It will be erased when the power is cut or the router is rebooted.&nbsp; The default size is up to half of the physical RAM-- you have 61 MB because the WDR4300 has a 128 MB RAM chip.&nbsp; RAM is allocated only as files are placed into tmpfs.&nbsp; If the &quot;drive&quot; is mostly empty, the RAM is available for other uses.</p>									</div>
