					<p>The instructions depend on the hardware version of your device. To determine which version you are using, open up the device&#039;s casing and check which DSL chip it has.</p><p>If it has a Lantiq DSL chip, follow these instructions to setup the DSL modem and the network interface <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#dslvdsl">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#dslvdsl</a></p><p>If it has a Broadcom DSL chip, follow these instructions instead <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#pppoa_adsl_internet_connection">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/networ â€¦ connection</a>.</p><p>Note that this only configures the DSL physical modem and associates a network interface to it. You will still need to configure the LAN / WLAN interfaces appropriately, configure the firewall zones &amp; forwarding and associate the network interfaces with the zones. These settings depend on what kind of a network you want to achieve.</p><p>For details on how to configure rest of the network, see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</a><br />For details on how to configure the UCI Firewall, see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</a></p>									</div>
