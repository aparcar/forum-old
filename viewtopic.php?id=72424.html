					<p>Hey guys, I have a Medion MD-86097 / E89030 WLAN USB Remote Hub, which has some limitations on stock firmware and therefore lay around over a long time. The SoC is supported by OpenWrt and it was easy to compile a firmware that boots up and if it is flashed, settings are stored. Ethernet, wireless, LEDs, Buttons and the onboard USB hub are working. Now I would like to configure OpenWrt to initialize the audio chip, so that it is recognized by alsa as a soundcard and could be used by any player app (e.g. for webradio) or services like mtd.</p><p>First some specs:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Ralink RT3052F MIPS SoC @384 MHz</p></li><li><p>32 MB SDRAM (2x winbond W9812G6IH)</p></li><li><p>4 MB CMOS Flash via SPI (Macronix MX25L3205D)</p></li><li><p>802.11n WLAN 2.4 GHz (SoC)</p></li><li><p>1x 10/100 Ethernet (SoC)</p></li><li><p>4x USB 2.0 (Genesys Logic GL852)</p></li><li><p>1x Audio out (3.5 mm Stereo jack) (Realtek ALC5621, I2S Audio codec)</p></li><li><p>Serial Console: Yes - 57600 8N1 (connector J2: 3.3V / RX / GND / TX )</p></li><li><p>JTAG: No</p></li></ul><p>Well I&#039;m somewhat stuck with the audio chip of that device. The codec chip uses i2s for the sound and i2c for control commands. So I enabled I2C and I2S via dts file and defined a simple-audio-card with the alc5621, which is in the kernel drivers. On boot console it says:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   11.048678] i2c-ralink 10000900.i2c: clock 100KHz, re-start not support
[   11.084344] ralink-i2s 10000a00.i2s: mclk 128KHz
[   11.099784] alc562x-codec 0-001a: failed to read vendor ID1: -6</code></pre></div><p>With this, I&#039;m not surprised that alsa says &quot;no soundcards found&quot;.</p><p>I also tried i2cdetect, which responds at nearly every address:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# i2cdetect 0
WARNING! This program can confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss and worse!
I will probe file /dev/i2c-0.
I will probe address range 0x03-0x77.

The solution is most probably the MCLK pin, the codec chip needs a master clock input. On stock firmware I can measure about 1.7V on that pin, so there seems to be a signal (I don&#039;t have a scope) - with my OpenWrt firmware it is at 0V. On stock firmware, when I connect to the sound port with that windows tool they provide for that, I have these lines on console:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>=====&gt; RALINK_SYSCTL_BASE+0x30 = 0x00042880
=====&gt; PCM_PCMCFG = 0x43000000
enable_pcm_clk: enabled
i2s_open succeeds
audio_thread started...</code></pre></div><p>I found in the RT3050/52 Datasheet that the first line would configure &quot;Clock Configuration Register 1&quot; (base: 0x1000.0000, offset: 0x30) to the following values:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Bit 30 &quot;PBUS_DIV2&quot; = 0 : Pbus clock is running at the same frequency as System clock</p></li><li><p>Bit 18 &quot;OTG_CLK_EN&quot; = 1 : USB OTG clock is enabled</p></li><li><p>Bit 15 &quot;I2S_CLK_EN&quot; = 0 : I2S clock is gated</p></li><li><p>Bit 14 &quot;I2S_CLK_SEL&quot; = 0 : internal 15.625Mhz reference clock</p></li><li><p>Bits 13:8 &quot;I2S_CLK_DIV&quot; = 0b101000 = 40 : I2S clock divider will divide the reference clock by (I2S_CLK_DIV+1)</p></li><li><p>Bit 7 &quot;PCM_CLK_EN&quot; = 1 : PCM clock is enabled</p></li><li><p>Bit 6 &quot;PCM_CLK_SEL&quot; = 0 : internal 15.625Mhz reference clock</p></li><li><p>Bits 5:0 &quot;PCM_CLK_DIV&quot; = 0 : The PCM clock divider will divide the reference clock by (PCM_CLK_DIV+1)</p></li></ul><p>(I2S is probably enabled later?)<br />The second line would configure PCM_CFG register (base: 0x1000.0400, offset: 0x04) like this:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Bit 31 &quot;EXT_CLK_EN&quot; = 0 : PCM_CLK is generated by internal clock divider</p></li><li><p>Bit 30 &quot;CLKOUT_EN&quot; = 1 : Enable the PCM_CLK_OUT to be free run</p></li><li><p>Bit 27 &quot;EXT_FSYNC&quot; = 0 : FSYNC is generated by internal circuit</p></li><li><p>Bit 26 &quot;LONG_FSYNC&quot; = 0 : FSYNC mode is short FSYNC</p></li><li><p>Bit 25 &quot;FSYNC_POL&quot; = 1 : Polarity of FSYNC is high active</p></li><li><p>Bit 24 &quot;DRX_TRI&quot; = 1 : Tristate the DRX as fall edge as LSB bit</p></li><li><p>Bits 2:0 &quot;SLOT_MODE&quot; = 0 : 4 slots each PCM frame, PCM clock out/in should be 256KHz</p></li></ul><p>So my guess is that the codec&#039;s MCLK pin is connected to the RT3052&#039;s PCMCLK pin, and I would have to use UARTF_SHARE_MODE = PCM, I2S. I did not find anything like &quot;ralink,rt3050-pcm&quot; that I could add to the dts/dtsi files, so how would I setup and enable the PCM clock? Should I really write directly to those registers, like the stock firmware seems to do? What is the command for that and where would I place a device specific startup/configuration script in OpenWrt (that most probably needs to be executed before loading alc562x-codec)?</p><p>I hope you can give me a hint or example for that. <br />Thanks, <br />rumpelzwo</p>									</div>
