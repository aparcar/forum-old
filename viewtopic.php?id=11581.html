					<p>Hi all,<br />I was testing out a x86 based system last night, after managing to get ext2_image dd onto hda and installing the additional *.ipk to get a usable system. </p><p>[Hint: after using a live-CD to dd the image to /dev/hda, create a 3rd partition make it ext2 and copy all of the *.ipk there. Once the router comes up you can mount the /dev/hda3 partition and install all the packages you need.]</p><p>I was able to configure the network IP/Netmask etc., however the format of the /etc/config/wireless file is a little elusive (by default it is empty). </p><p>The documentation page (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam â€¦ figuration</a>) contains some info but doesn&#039;t cover x86 based systems. I can hand configure the wireless, but obviously I want it to boot to the correct settings.</p><p>Q). What &#039;option type&#039; should I use?</p><p>I am attempting to build up a node with only a wireless card (prism2 based) to act as OLSRD repeater/node. If that is sucessfull I shall include an ethernet card and enable WAN/LAN functionality.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Munge. </p><p>PS. Such a small distro really flies on x86 hardware. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/yikes.png" width="15" height="15" alt="yikes" />)</p><p>PPS. As the standard repositry doesn&#039;t include OLSRD (why?) I used the one from <a href="http://ipkg.k1k2.de/x86/packages/">http://ipkg.k1k2.de/x86/packages/</a> which seems to work fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>They might have gotten around to implementing the prism type by now.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably easiest to just make an init script, though.&nbsp; Tracing what gets called can get to be a pain when editing scripts.</p>									</div>
