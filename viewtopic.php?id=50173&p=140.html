					<p>@mojolacerator</p><p>Linksys is using a custom-built kernel for its official firmware (3.2.4), with proprietary hacks in various places, including drivers and subsystems. Porting the drivers for mainline kernels is not an easy task and requires rewriting most of the code (if not entirely). Back to the WRT1900AC, there is a huge difference between the driver used in official firmware (it is split in two: API&#039;s and the binary file) and the open-source driver (clean Linux code). That&#039;s why the original driver used by Chadster in his McWRT branch could not be included in mainline OpenWRT.</p><p>nitroshift</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nitroshift</strong> on 11 Mar 2015, 12:15)</p>
