					<p>First this will start as tutorial for beginners folks here, and later on will turn in to a problem seeking - asking more knowledgeable to help with a problem connecting multiply sensors on a single i2c bus? </p><p> We&#039;ll use free GPIOs form DIR-505 LED D5 that is not factory installed! </p><p>What you’ll need:<br /> DIR-505 second hand works too<br />Temperature/Humidity SHT20D or SI7021-A10-GMR both the same but second one cheaper. <br />Two 10kΩ pull-up resistors, 100nF capacitor - I scavenger mine from an old Dell Laptop. <br />Some wires <br />Small 40-80W soldering iron with a good tip. Good soldering skills or passion to learn and may be second router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Flash your router with Barrier Breaker form stock D-Link firmware using emergency recovery: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-505">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-505</a></p><p>Some shoots before we start: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/53731093@N06/shares/85C893">https://www.flickr.com/photos/53731093@ … res/85C893</a></p><p>Hardware installation and connections: </p><p>What we have on the board: LED D5 not installed. Position next to the system LED D4 two colour green/red installed, under the shield AR1131. Open the top shield carefully and solder 3 wires, check carefully after you are done!&nbsp; </p><p>D5 left pin (next to the RAM chip)&nbsp; +3.3Vdd - connect to sensor +Vdd pin5<br />D5 middle pin - Resistor R653 330Ω in series - GPIO18 - SDA connect to sensor pin1<br />D5 left pin ( led D4 on the left ) - Resistor R92 330Ω in series - GPIO21 -SCL connect ot sensor pin 6<br />GND connect to sensor Vss pin2 <br />Connect two 10kΩ pull up resistors from GPIO18&amp;21 to +3.3Vdd</p><p>If it’s too difficult for you to solder on LED D5 pads, then you can use SW5 mode switch instead. Set the switch to “Repeater&quot; position, and then &quot;Wi-Fi HotSpot” - pin2 is GPIO19 and &quot;Router/AP&quot; - pin5 is GPIO20 and you’ll not need pull-up resistors 10kΩ because they are installed on the board, just connect sensor to +3.3V GND and GPIO19&amp;20 ( SDA&amp;SCL )</p><br /><p>Software installation:</p><p>I assume you have installed BB on your DIR-505<br />Connect and go to web management interface <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a><br />Setup a password once you log in, connect and setup internet connection, in my case I use ethernet wire to connect to the router and setup DIR-505 as WiFi client to connect to my main router. <br />Optional: If your main router uses the same subnet 192.168.1.1 you&#039;ll have to change to a different subnet example: 192.168.10.1 (Network/Interfaces/LAN-Edit change IPv4 address from /192.168.1.1 to&nbsp; 192.168.10.1) before connecting&nbsp; to your main router. <br />Then reboot and log in to SSH terminal ssh root@192.168.1.1<br />Do a “opkg update”<br />&quot;opkg install&nbsp; kmod-hwmon-sht21” this will install all dependent packages as well! <br />&quot;opkg install kmod-i2c-gpio-custom” this will install all dependent packages as well! <br />we make sure GPIOs are set on boot time: &quot;echo &quot;i2c-gpio-custom.ko bus0=0,18,21&quot; &gt; /etc/modules.d/58-i2c-gpio-custom”<br />Reboot your router</p><p>Make sure you’ve connected your sensor before powering on and continue:<br />Check if your custom GPIOs are loaded on boot:<br />&quot;dmesg | grep i2c” output should be similar:<br />[&nbsp; 508.900000] i2c-gpio i2c-gpio.0: using pins 18 (SDA) and 21 (SCL)</p><p>activate your sensor ( from the sht21 driver manual we know that sensor uses 0x40 address): <br />&quot;echo sht21 0x40 &gt; /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new_device&quot;</p><p>Check again with dmesg:<br />&quot;dmesg | grep i2c” output should be similar:<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;11.620000] i2c-gpio i2c-gpio.0: using pins 18 (SDA) and 21 (SCL)<br />[ 1178.220000] i2c i2c-0: new_device: Instantiated device sht21 at 0x40</p><p>Almost ready!
