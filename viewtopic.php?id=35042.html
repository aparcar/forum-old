					<p>Hi,<br />I am planning to buy a new router, and now I am interested whether it is possible to install a synchronising software.</p><p>Until now I&#039;m using the software &quot;Super Flexible File Synchronizer&quot; with Windows to synchronise my external hard drive to an SFTP-Server, but there is also a <a href="http://www.superflexible.com/linux.htm">Linux Version</a>. My problem is, that the synchronisation needs a long time due to a slow internet connection I have to run my computer very long.<br />So I want to know, if I can put my external hard drive to my router and let him do the synchronisation with the &quot;Super Flexible File Synchronizer&quot; software. Can you tell me, if it is possible to install this software on the router? Do I need any specific router specifications?</p><p>Finally I have to say, that I have newer worked with OpenWrt and I only have less experience in working with Linux systems, so probably my question looks silly to experience users <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>The Linux software offered by the vendor is for x86 only, so it will most likely not run on your OpenWrt router which is typically using the MIPS or less commonly ARM architecture.</p>									</div>
