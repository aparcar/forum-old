					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;m running rtorrent in bleeding-edge Kamikaze, seeding a torrent with almost ten thousands of files. Unfortunately, rtorrent kept complaining insufficient file descriptors. To calm the complaint I have to: 1. run screen by root-privilidge. 2. set ulimit menully. 3. run rtorrent. which looks so stupid. But I can&#039;t address it easily due to the lack of &quot;/etc/security/limits.conf&quot; mechanism. Is there any more decent approach to kill such kind of issues?</p><p>Best Regards.</p><p>Bug</p>									</div>
