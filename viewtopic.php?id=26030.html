					<p>I installed the 10.3 backfire release for the WNDR3700 and opkg&#039;d the packages below.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#WNDR Packages

Everything is good. Then I realized that the 5GHz antenna was not on. I checked the config and realized that it was disabled=1 (for some reasong LUCI doesn&#039;t give a config option).</p><p>Anyhow, I changed that to 0 like the 2.4 antenna.

					<p>5 GHz doesn&#039;t work by default. This is a known problem.
