					<p>That&#039;s a misunderstanding of the question I think. The OP is asking if there is a way to isolate WiFi clients from <strong>each other</strong> meaning every Wi-Fi client is prevented from contacting other Wi-Fi clients directly even ones in the same zone (network) and traffic can only flow to the default gateway. For example see the &quot;Private VLAN&quot; feature of Cisco enterprise switches.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, BenFranske is right. I do want the Wi-Fi clients to not be able to talk to each other.</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally figured out how to get this to work and even managed to test it. Isolation works perfectly with Wi-Fi.</p><p>Just now though, I thought of olofl&#039;s post and thought it would be a great idea to isolate Wi-Fi from LAN for security purposes. olofl, which part of the firewall would I change to make this happen?</p>									</div>
