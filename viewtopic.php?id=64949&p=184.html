					<p>@mariano.silva who cares about luci? just show your /etc/config/wireless config file (with no passwords)... do a default config, set wifi to disabled in luci, reboot, then enable again, should work. Also use a non DFS flagged channel, like 36 (anything above 48 is flagged for DFS) for example... like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;
