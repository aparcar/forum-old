					<p>Hi, recently I have upgraded my home router to OpenWRT 15.05.<br />It seems that the new firmware by default has IPTABLE FORWARD chain set to REJECT/BLOCK (whats a difference?).</p><p><span style="color: blue"><br />root@OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/config/firewall<br />config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;REJECT&#039;<br /></span> </p><p>I had to change &quot;option forward&quot; to ACCEPT to be able to play my favorite online game again.<br />Though it wonders me: if FORWARD is set to REJECT by default (and not a single port is specified to be opened), how is that possible that I could have reached any WWW in internet up from my LAN pc&#039;s ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>czezz</strong> on 11 Dec 2015, 11:19)</p>

					<p>Hi stas2z,<br />thanks for your reply.</p><p>Its quite difficult to read what is set up in OpenWRT iptables.<br />But if FORWARD is setup to REJECT/DROP by default but HTTP/HTTPS is allowed then I would write this in pure IPTABLES like following:<br /><span style="color: blue"><br />iptables -P FORWARD DROP<br />iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A FORWARD -i br-lan -p tcp -m multiport --dport 80,443 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0.2 -j MASQUERADE<br />echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward<br /></span></p><p>Meanwhile, in&nbsp; /etc/config/firewall I can see no information about HTTP/HTTPS and if you are saying that FORWARD is reject by default since AA <em>(AA - stands for some OpenWRT early version ?)</em> how come it is possible to browse web from LAN pcs ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey appreciate for answer and thanks for this command.&nbsp; </p><p>Im trying now to read it and understand of what is happening there - not easy though.<br />Can anyone please have a look at my configuration (attached in the following link) and help me to find out which part is responsible for FORWARD chain ?</p><p>By FORWARD, I understand traffic that is forwarded/NATed between LAN PCs and Internet servers.</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypu3jnw935mu4g6/iptables-save.out?dl=0">iptables-save.out</a></p>									</div>
