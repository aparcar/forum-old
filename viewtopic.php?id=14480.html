					<p>in the evdo forum <br /><a href="http://www.evdoforums.com/thread504-0-asc.html">http://www.evdoforums.com/thread504-0-asc.html</a></p><p>they say that you can make your wireless card faster if you use this tip. Now I did try this when I had the card connected to a laptop and it worked very well. I played around with the variables in cable nut and used this setting until I got a very fast speed. <br />However now the card is in a wrt54g3g router running white Russian 0.9 I think. It connects but was wondering if there is a place where I could put in settings like this so that it could be tweaked<br />i would need to make this happen <br />TCP Receive Window Size = 65536 <br />which is the heart of this tip for these type of cards. <br />Anyway to get into the guts of white russian and &quot;make it so&quot;?</p>									</div>

					<p>These settings are in the Linux kernel. The TCP window scaling should be enabled and it tunes the window size within limits set in the /proc/sys/net/core/ files below:</p><p>rmem_default , rmem_max&nbsp; &nbsp;(for reads)</p><p>wmem_default , wmem_max&nbsp; (for writes)</p><p>on my Kamikaze and Whiterussian routers these appear to be set to 32767/32767, whereas a Fedora workstation has 111616/131071.</p><p>The downside to increasing these values is that individual sockets can take more kernel memory, which could become an issue on your router with its small RAM size if you have many connections open. But you can just echo a larger value into those files e.g. &quot;echo 131071 &gt; /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max; echo 131071 &gt; /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max&quot; to try it out.</p><p>NOTE: these settings only matter on the endpoint hosts of your TCP connections. If you are trying to get better performance from a computer on your LAN to a server on the Internet, it is your computer and the server which need to enable large TCP windows. There is no need to make any change on the router unless you are opening connections between the router and a remote server.</p>									</div>

					<p>err, ok, I am kind of a noob at this, do you think the setting would help?</p><p>It looks like implementing this would be just above my skill level at the moment but thats never stopped me before. </p><p>can you post the same tip in english? jk</p><p>Just looking to get a little more wireless performance out of this card.

					<p>I am just asking but on a practical level (really s l oooo wwww) could someone explain how to edit this file and put in the 65536 value. I have poked around but I am a lowly old windows user. Linux stuff is brand new to me.</p>									</div>
