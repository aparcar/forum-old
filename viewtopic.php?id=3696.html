					<p>I tried compiling ctorrent, and failed...</p><p>Has anyone created a package for either CTorrent or Libtorrent/rtorrent.&nbsp; They are both light-weight, written in C++, and I know CTorrent only requires OpenSSL.&nbsp; Anyway, I figure it would be pretty easy for someone to port (assuming they are familiar with the whole cross compile thing and ipkg system).&nbsp; &nbsp;If there is an existing build for either, just ignore everything I say below and reply where to get it.</p><p>I tried creating a binary for ctorrent, but was getting failures saying I didn&#039;t have the library for openssl, so I removed the lines causing the problem, got it compiled, and tried it out.&nbsp; I got the most active torrent I could find, one for Desperate Housewives, threw the binary for ctorrent on my usb drive, and tried running it.&nbsp; Got an error saying it was missing libstdc++.so.6 or something.&nbsp; So I went and found the library in the build environment, copied it to my USB drive, and made sym links to the /lib folder.&nbsp; It worked!!,&nbsp; so I let it sit for a while and got a few errors saying could not connect to tracker or something, and then noticed that in the top where ctorrent scrolls things, it had said &quot;error, failed to create desperate_housewives.avi file&quot; during the whole initialization thing.&nbsp; I tried to track this error down and can&#039;t see why it is causing.&nbsp; A file was created of length 0, and I got sick of waiting to see if it would start downloading.&nbsp; On my computer, ctorrent allocated the full file length (350MB in this case) before hand, so I figured something was wrong anyway and stopped trying.&nbsp; </p><p>Could this have something to do with the fact that it was trying to create the file on a mounted FAT32 partition or could somehow removing the four lines dealing with SSL/SHA1 caused the problem.&nbsp; I looked in the code at the source of the problem, and it seems like pretty straight forward stdio.h type of calls to create the files.&nbsp; </p><p>Anyway, I give up.&nbsp; I am asking if anyone who knows the right way to cross compile and access those libraries could make the binary or package.&nbsp; I really think for someone with experience it wouldn&#039;t take long at all considering that someone who has never even cross-compiled a package or ever used that SDK was able to figure it out this far in a few hours.&nbsp; </p><p>My goal was to integrate a command line torrent client into the web server for friendly access so that me, my g/f, and roommates don&#039;t have to leave their computers running 24/7 giving us electricity bills over $140 a month.&nbsp; Torrents could be run on the router, leaving on all the time, and you could access the status easily, add new torrents easily over the web interface.&nbsp; I think 200MHz will be plenty, and since the whole purpose is to act as a file server/torrent client, it shouldn&#039;t be a big deal anyway.&nbsp; </p><p>Anyway, if someone can get either command line torrent program working, I will write the http scripts to give it a nice graphical frontend for the web server.&nbsp; I know there is reasonable demand</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi RItalMan </p><p>ctorrent is working fine indeed, but any real reason why you havent compiled the latest version (1.3.4) ?</p><p>Also - there is an enhanced version fixing some bugs, and bringing some stuff up2date according to the BT protocol...:<br /><a href="http://www.rahul.net/dholmes/ctorrent/">http://www.rahul.net/dholmes/ctorrent/</a></p><p>It would be nice to see a build of that one.</p>									</div>

					<p>When I installed ctorrent using<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipkg install http://openwrt.alphacore.net/ctorrent_1.3.2_mipsel.ipk</code></pre></div><p>it installed itself and libpthread fine, but then when I ran it, I got an error indicating that it was missing a libopenssl library.&nbsp; So, I installed this library, and now I got that it was missing libstdc++.&nbsp; So, I then went and ran <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipkg install http://openwrt.alphacore.net/libstdc++_5.0.5_mipsel.ipk #Thank you RitalMan</code></pre></div><p>and finally, everything works... or at least it displays the startup messages... I haven&#039;t tried downloading torrent yet.</p><p>I was just wondering if all this was unique to my setup only or if mascat had to do the same thing as well.&nbsp; Anyway, if this is the case, should these other two dependencies be included?</p><p>To anyone reading this forum, installing libstdc++ requires a few megabytes, so you probably need a USB harddrive as I do, or some other form of extended storage space.</p><p>I too would be interested in the &quot;enhanced version&quot; if any developers would be willing to setup the package.&nbsp; <br />mascat:&nbsp; How well does ctorrent work compared to other torrent programs?</p>									</div>

					<p>At the time I ported ctorrent, the latest version did not compile fine at all, and there was ugly hacks to add in the code for it to cross-compile. Now I would like to recompile ctorrent and link it agains uClibc++, I will do it soon, stay tuned !</p>									</div>

					<p>I have yet to get it to download anything...</p><p>I have an external USB HD connected to my Asus router.&nbsp; It has an ext3 and a Fat32 partition, and whenever I try to download a file on the fat partition, it gives an error saying it failed to create the file.&nbsp; Downloading to the ext3 partition, it appears to work fine, but I have yet to get it to successfully download anything, or maybe I just don&#039;t know what it should look like when it does.&nbsp; Again, I tried to download a desperate_housewives episode since it is very active, and after 30 minutes, it didn&#039;t appear to be doing anything.&nbsp; I checked out tcpdump and it wasn&#039;t sending much of anything besides a few things to the tracker.&nbsp; Is there information somewhere as to what all the numbers mean for the display?</p><p>Hopefully the new version and patches can fix the FAT problem if it is truly a bug with ctorrent and not the usb-drivers.&nbsp; I will try to download some different files to see if I can get them working.&nbsp; Mascat, any tips on getting it transferring? </p><p>I look forward to seeing any new versions.&nbsp; I would still love to make a httpd interface if I can figure out how to get any downloads going.</p>									</div>
