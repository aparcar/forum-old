					<p>Bought a Buffalo WHR-G54S recently and the Buffalo claims it is able to do 2x range and 3x speed ( 125 Mbps ? ). What I need to find out from you folks if I load OpenWRT into the box, will I still get the so-called 2x range and 3x speed ? Or I would then downgrade things to 1xrange and 1x speed ? :-) </p><p>What does 3x speed really means ? Won&#039;t it mean breaking of the G standard and becoming proprietary ?</p><p>Hope someone could enlighten me on this.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think their claim is that by putting an amplifier on the transmitter it will maintain stronger connections and achieve higher speeds than the WHR-G54S.&nbsp; &nbsp; The 125 Mbps is referring to the proprietary Broadcom&nbsp; speedbooster.&nbsp; &nbsp; You can expect at most 30 Mb/s TCP throughput on broadcom speed booster connection.&nbsp; </p><p>OpenWRT will not slow your router down.</p>									</div>
