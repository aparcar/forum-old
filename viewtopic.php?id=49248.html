					<p>Hey Guys!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a pants Huwaei modem that is supported (and I&#039;ve found the download on here already) that I want to enable built in VPN functionality on as the OmanTEL firmware doesn&#039;t have it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking around and stumbled across this OpenWRT firmware and wonder if it&#039;s the firmware for me?</p><p>So my main requirements are to:<br />- interface to OmanTEL ADSL (guess I just copy down all the settings before flashing),<br />- ensure I keep a wifi capability<br />- ensure that the onboard Ethernet ports work<br />- be able to activate &quot;on-modem&quot; VPN at will<br />- have a GUI interface</p><p>Having gone through the FAQ and manuals I&#039;m still a bit confused. I&#039;ve noticed that the flashing seems easy enough but after that, I think I might be out of my depth.&nbsp; I have ZERO Unix skills as I come from a corporate/MS environment.&nbsp; I do believe that a GUI can be installed on the OpenWRT but again, would installing these be difficult - remember, I have ZERO CLI skills.</p><p>Is this the right route for me or should I try to find another ROM type?&nbsp; Would I be out of my depth?</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p>									</div>

					<p>Seriously guys, 34 reads and not even a single comment on what I imagine would be obvious to most of you...?&nbsp; Please help if you can, got a USA games console that I can&#039;t use until I accomplish this.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>It is probably not for you.</p><p>Using Openwrt more extensively requries some (not much) Linux CLI skills.<br />Especially if you want to use ADSL capabilities, which are not part of the regular Openwrt scope.</p><p>Similarly &quot;built-in VPN&quot; is probably related to the Omantel firmware, not actually to the device. I doubt if Openwrt has support for that VPN. </p><p>You did not even mention the exact equipment for which you are looking for advice, so no wonder that nodoby has answered before me.</p><p>Give more details and edit the subject to be more clear (direct reference to the device), so you may get more answers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 27 Feb 2014, 16:24)</p>
