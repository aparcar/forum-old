					<p>Well, what i want to do is block sites with dns that is forced through the router like here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26535">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26535</a></p><p>That works great and will make the site not load at all, which is great. However i only want to block sites on a single computer and have tried</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -m mac –mac-source xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -m mac –mac-source xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -p tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53</code></pre></div><p>xx:xx...etc is the computer i want to filter. this does not work, so i am guessing i am just dumb (and probably am lol).</p><p>i have never used iptables before, and iptables --help does not help at all. i also can not do man iptables either. i tried looking stuff up online and tutorials and stuff, but they either contain irreverent information or way too much and i am unable to find anything.</p><p>if anyone knows how to do this, please help, i have no idea what i am doing.</p><p>the router i am using is the netgear wndr-3700</p>									</div>
