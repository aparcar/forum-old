					<p>Hi,<br />I am looking to purchase a higher-end USB webcam which I plan to plug into my WL500gPv1 router with OpenWRT on it, and use it as a decent surveillance device. What I am looking for is a model with decent linux support, capability to use higher frame rates (25 to 30 FPS) and some decent resolution - should be at least 800*600, but I am willing to go for a higher one up to 1600*1200. I would like to know what webcam models/bands you guys recommend for such task.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just set up this one as a Baby Cam:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WVC54GCA-Wireless-Internet-Monitoring/dp/B0010OXEDU">http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WVC54GCA- â€¦ B0010OXEDU</a></p><p>Lessons learned for this camera:<br />Note that there is a problem with the latest Linksys firmware.&nbsp; WPA does NOT work.&nbsp; It took me hours to find that out.&nbsp; Most of the negative reviews are about one form or another of this problem.&nbsp; I ended up setting up another SSID with no encryption just for the camera. This also makes the data stream closer to real time as there is no overhead for encryption/decryption. Security is not an issue for me as my camera is not open to the net and my (non-tech) neighbors are too far to pick up a signal from my router.&nbsp; I&#039;m not storing the video either (but that may change later).&nbsp; BTW, this camera does MPEG-4 which is easier on bandwidth than MJPEG.&nbsp; I use VLC to play the video and audio stream (Firefox doesn&#039;t play the audio for some reason). I&#039;m streaming 640x480, 30fps, medium quality video over a Wireless G system at the moment.&nbsp; Reasonably good quality in daytime, poor quality in low light.&nbsp; Good luck and let us know which camera you ended up with.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>saidiadude</strong> on 16 Jun 2009, 01:00)</p>

					<p>The Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 provides hardware compression at 960x720.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about your frame rate.&nbsp; I have it working on a NSLU2 with openWrt 8.09 r15469, with kmod-video-core, kmod-video-uvc kmod-usb-core, mjpg_streamer.&nbsp; &nbsp;This command serves it on a web page at port 8080:</p><p>mjpg_streamer -i &quot;input_uvc.so -r 960x720&quot; -o &quot;output_http.so -p 8080 -w /webcam_www&quot;&amp;</p>									</div>
