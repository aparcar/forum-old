					<p>How do I set up logging of dropped/rejected packets on the WAN interface (something that was kind of obvious on all routers I used in the past)? I can&#039;t seem to find it in the Luci web interface, and I&#039;m not yet comfortable changing the config files manually.</p>									</div>

					<p>Luci provides rather basic logging functionality for dropped/rejected packets under advanced settings for each firewall zone (eg WAN). You may want to use remote logging if you want extended logs kept. For more detailed stuff you need to know what to add via &quot;extra arguments&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>You mean the checkbox next to &quot;Enable logging on this zone&quot;? I didn&#039;t want to turn it on yet, as it offers no option on what to log (e.g. accepted, dropped, rejected packets), so I guess it&#039;ll log everything (resulting in accepted packets logs mostly overwriting dropped/rejected). How can I only set it to log dropped &amp; rejected (I can do this in a config file via shell, if I know exactly where and what to put there)?<br />Should I install ulogd package (not sure the router has enough extra space for additional modules, though)?</p><p>As for remote logging... I have that at another location, via snmpd, on DD-WRT. But at this one, the local logging of dropped and rejected for the last N hours should suffice for now.</p>									</div>
