					<p>Hi; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I am new to OpenWRT.&nbsp; I recently purchased and installed a GL-MT300A.&nbsp; I am able to read from the Micro SD Card.&nbsp; However, when I try to write to it, it fails due to permissions.&nbsp; When I access the card it asks for a username and password. How do I set that up?&nbsp; Using root and rootpswd does not work.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Frank</p>									</div>

I also tried again unsuccessfully to write to the internal micro sd card (mnt/mmcblk0p1) and received an error stating access denied and that I needed permission to perform that action (I can read the files without any issues.) From the GL.iNet interface, both share drives show the Windows logo above the drive icon. I am trying to access them from a Windows 10 PC. I did look under GL.iNet interface Advanced Settings-Services-Network Shares and Allow Guests is checked and Read only is not checked for both devices. I also did see that kmod-mmc 3.18.27-1 and kmod-usb-storage 3.18.27-1 are installed.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a MIFI and my SD card mounts as mnt/sda1.&nbsp; Seeing mnt/sdb1 for a USB drive, I assume connected after the card is inserted, would seem to confirm this expectation.&nbsp; Not sure however if this is the issue.</p><p>You can check the logs for sda1, but I think you should post this on the GL.inet forum or contact their tech support.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/">http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/</a></p><p>You will also want to report your GL.iNet firmware version which you can find on the lower left of the main page.</p>									</div>
