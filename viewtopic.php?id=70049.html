					<p>I have written a script that automatically enable/disable firewall rules.&nbsp; This allows me to program a crontab that cuts the internet to various devices which my kids use.&nbsp; It essentially calls the following command:</p><p>&nbsp; uci set &quot;firewall.@rule[${index}].enabled=${STATUS}&quot;</p><p>Thus, when it is time for my youngest to go to bed, her devices are cut.&nbsp; My older boy has his devices cut later.</p><p>It works, but there is a problem.&nbsp; Once &#039;uci set&#039; is called, to activate it I run:</p><p>&nbsp; /etc/init.d/firewall restart</p><p>That command interrupts current connections.&nbsp; My boy complains that when my girl&#039;s devices get cut, his game on the console gets aborted.&nbsp; He can join back right away, but it is disruptive.</p><p>Is there a better way to enable/disables rules without restarting the whole firewall chains?&nbsp; Sure, I know, I can call iptables myself, bypassing uci, but I am not familiar with it and I want something simple.&nbsp; Something like the equivalent of:</p><p>uci reload &quot;firewall.@rule[${index}]&quot;</p><p>Anybody has any suggestion?</p>									</div>

					<p>If I&#039;ve understood your situation correctly, you shouldn&#039;t need to restart your whole firewall nor to reload any single rule: you can just set firewall rules that are active only during specific time intervals. You don&#039;t need to learn iptables commands to do this, you can use uci or just edit the /etc/config/firewall file manually. Have a look at the section &quot;Block access to the Internet for specific IP on certain times&quot; at the page <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</a> (you can change the blocking criteria of course, doesn&#039;t have to be IP).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>endvour</strong> on 28 Feb 2017, 12:10)</p>

					<p>Thanks, but... my specifications were not complete.&nbsp; You see, my kids are often naughty.&nbsp; Thus I do block the internet often, on the spot.&nbsp; I cannot thus plan in advance when the internet must be blocked.</p>									</div>

Iptables is your best bet. It isn&#039;t difficult, the syntax closely reflects that of uci (or I should say vice-versa), it&#039;s only more compact.</p>									</div>
