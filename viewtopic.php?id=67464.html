I can&#039;t see how they&#039;d not use 1 GBit Ethernet ports, but being a budget priced router, <br />ya never know. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I read it has a VPN Server, and an FTP File Server too, besides the streaming of videos, all built-in.<br />Plus printer support<br />I wonder if they also added the streamingMPEG package for cameras, too</p><p>That USB3.0 really makes me want to get one now, haha.</p><p>It looks like it may be more based in the OpenWRT format... The default IP shown in the users manual is<br />192.168.1.1<br />Not even the Users Manual from the FCC site shows the specs of this routers Ethernet ports <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> <br />...wow HooToo...why?</p><p><strong>---EDIT---</strong><br />This is just the prototype user manual, because the actual IP for the retail model is 10.10.10.252<br />---according to their own website info about it. ---<br />Maybe when they post the actual official Owners Manual on the HooToo site, we&#039;ll know more.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooJunkie</strong> on 12 Sep 2016, 00:34)</p>

					<p>Well...
