					<p>hi,</p><p>i&#039;ve a question about local routing:<br />my wl500gp with Kamikaze 7.09 installed has two vlans:<br />vlan0 is connected to another router which provides internet access and several computers.<br />vlan1 is connected to some other computers which shouldn&#039;t have internet access.<br />in addition computers from one vlan can&#039;t connect to computers of the other one.</p><p>so far everything works fine, but i wonder why, they should be able to connect to each other using the openwrt-router as gateway, but they can&#039;t.</p><p>and now i want to connect with a computer from vlan0 to vlan1 and vice versa, but only on port 80, the others still shouldn&#039;t be accessible.<br />how can this be done? with iptables?<br />i read much about iptables, but i don&#039;t really understand how they work.<br />i only find out how to redirect connections which are adressed to openwrt, but not how to route traffic between different network interfaces, which isn&#039;t addressed to openwrt</p>									</div>
