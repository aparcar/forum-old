					<p>Ok, so there is definitely a regression somewhere in wifi at/before r1382 (2016-08-19), which was when we got that new IRQ fix code merged.</p><p>I went back to r1261 (2016-08-05) and wifi lost all of the stuttering and slow loading of things from my mobile devices. Oddly, the actual throughput wasn&#039;t really bad, it was just the actual functionality wasn&#039;t working well. The symptom is when doing anything on a wifi device (all android) that it would start to load something and then just sit and spin for awhile before loading it. Even things like small image files would take numerous seconds, when on the old build would be instantaneous.</p><p>(Just as a side note, if you try to reinstall a bunch of packages at the same time, it tends to not go well -- mine was having all sorts of problems till I broke them down into pieces).</p><p>Edit: just tested today&#039;s build, r1480, and it seemed much better than 1392, but still a little slower than r1261. Hmmm..... Also, thinks are working strange on trunk -- packages keep installing incorrectly. If I install the material theme, half of the time it doesn&#039;t work and then I have to reinstall it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TeutonJon78</strong> on 2 Sep 2016, 05:37)</p>

					<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>Today I&#039;m looking at the wireless/802.11 MAC addresses with my TEW-827DRU.</p><p>Did this ever get fixed properly for the C2600? I think the last informative post on the issue was <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=328982#p328982">here</a>, and ianchi mentioned that he wrote a tool, as mentioned <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=317711#p317711">here</a>, to modify the calibration data after it was extracted from flash storage.</p><p>Is this right? Are there actually MAC addresses in the ART partition? I dumped mine and compared it to what my system is setting and didn&#039;t see such strings, but maybe it&#039;s encoded, or the driver is setting random junk because that section is all zeros. I have no idea.</p><p>My device has the layer 2 addresses in the u-boot env partition, so it&#039;s very easy to get. However, the act of setting it seem not be working. The Ath10k driver sets the hard addresses during driver load and then they can&#039;t be changed at that level.</p><p>Is my interpretation of the situation up-to-date, or did this get figured out some other way?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>--</p><p>EDIT: I see it now, in the calibration data file.</p><p>dd if=/lib/firmware/ath10k/cal-pci-0000:01:00.0.bin bs=2 conv=swab 2&gt; /dev/null | hexdump | head</p><p>dd if=/lib/firmware/ath10k/cal-pci-0001:01:00.0.bin bs=2 conv=swab 2&gt; /dev/null | hexdump | head</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@lede:/lib/firmware/ath10k# iw dev
