					<p>I&#039;m wondering if this problem is just affecting me, or if madwifi just doesn&#039;t really work.</p><p>I tried to deploy a couple of Gateworks Avila boards running 7.07 today with <br />Atheros radios (Routerboard R52H). The pair of boards worked perfectly in the lab however<br />when I put them in the field the board in the AP mode suffered kernel crashes<br />any time traffic passed on the wireless interfaces. Basically it wouldn&#039;t stay up<br />for more than a minute or so.</p><p>It crashed both when our existing clients associated with it (they&#039;re mostly<br />tranzeo 802.11b cpe), and also when it was trying to associate with <br />its peer using 802.11a.</p><p>Is anyone running a 2.6 kernel with madwifi on arm hardware as an access point and having<br />success ? If so I&#039;d like to hear about what version of the driver you&#039;re using.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>After a few days pulling hair I can answer my own question : </p><p>The madwifi shipped in current (7.07, 7.09) versions of OpenWrt just doesn&#039;t<br />work at all on ixp425 hardware. It&#039;s completely broken, causing kernel panics.</p><p>madwifi regressed a fix for pci register access on this hardware some time in the past.<br />The fix didn&#039;t get put back in until recently, after r2568 that OpenWrt is using.</p><p>I&#039;ve successfully built and deployed r2708 in OpenWrt 7.07 and it cures my <br />kernel hangs, crashes, and a bunch of other strange happenings.</p><p>Some links :</p><p><a href="http://madwifi.org/ticket/1405">http://madwifi.org/ticket/1405</a> <br /><a href="http://madwifi.org/ticket/1570">http://madwifi.org/ticket/1570</a> </p><p>If anyone is interested in my patch set for r2708 and OpenWrt let me know.</p>									</div>
