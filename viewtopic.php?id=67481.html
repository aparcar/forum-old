					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I received a DIR-615 D4. Set up for access point second router, but after a few hours it stopped.</p><p>After checking, both green and orange power light is on when it tries to start; cannot reset, cannot go to f upgrade screen. Checked the power IC&#039;s, one has 3,3V output, one 1,5V. Is this normal?</p><p>On the serial connector, 3,3V is OK. No serial output when i try to boot it.</p><p>(I know that it is a hardware fault, but need ideas about what i need to replace on the board...)</p><p>Does anyone know what can cause an error like this? </p><p>Any help will be appreciated. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>colt2x</strong> on 10 Sep 2016, 21:23)</p>
