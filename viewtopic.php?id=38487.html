					<p>I tried the same router a friend&#039;s place with another ISP and it works fine there. My home ISP is Charter and I observed that it was not responding to any of the DHCP requests sent by udhcpc. Based on these observations, it seems that it may be problem with the ISP rather than Openwrt.</p><p>Thanks<br />Ashish</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to make some headway on this issue, and it is a Charter issue.</p><p>If your router is deemed to make too many DHCP requests in a short period of time, the MAC address is banned and you can&#039;t get an address.&nbsp; The banning seems to be extensive, greater than 48 hours.</p><p>Changing the MAC address and manually running udhcpc -t 2 -T 3 -A 300 works like a champ.&nbsp; If I go back to the standard settings of -t 0 and unplug the cable modem a few times, eventually that MAC address will end up not working.&nbsp; Fortunately, I&#039;ve been using those of some old 3Com 10/100 cards.</p><p>I am unclear however, on the best method to getting these changes permanent.</p>									</div>

					<p>After struggling with this for a while... EDIT: deleted content, I&#039;m not just not sure of anything. Charter&#039;s DHCP server is extremely finicky. It can and will refuse to assign you an IP if too many requests are made (and it doesn&#039;t take many!). This may be due to the way IPs are assigned. Perhaps issuing too many requests causes their IPv4 address pool to dry up, as they may keep an IP active while idle for some period of time. It seems to resolve eventually. OpenWrt&#039;s default udhcpc configuration seems non-ideal for sure. The LuCI broadcast flag setting that mentions Charter does not seem to have an effect.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>db90h</strong> on 6 Feb 2013, 06:41)</p>

					<p>Any headway? I believe the issue (from other searches) is that udhcpc does not send the broadcast flag, even when enabled to in OpenWRT configs. I have Charter and had no issues with my Cisco DPC3010 modem, but it died and I had to swap it today for a Motorola SURFboard SB6121 and OpenWRT would not pull a DHCP address.</p><p>As a quick workaround I added an old WRT54GL router I had sitting around with DD-WRT between my OpenWRT router and the modem and voila, the WRT54GL pulled an IP without issue and my LAN is back up.</p><p>This is the tcpdump showing that udhcpc did not send the broadcast flag despite that I have it enabled.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;

I can watch them go by with delay. Before its was so fast I could not even see them all. Holding steady with B1 so far ... wish me luck..I think it was just somebody on my node.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: 9:41 AM 11/14/2013 </strong><br />Got dropped only once last night during usenet transfers. Dropped the threads down to 1 and set max speed to 300KB/s from 1000KB/s. I also found out that spam posts on a.b.movies ( just over 6million) on usenet caused my indexer to failsause and download for days straight so that may be the root issue .. I hope .. I ran out of disk space on it. Everything seems happy but I want openwrt back so I plan to wait a few days and push it to my WRT54G v2 or try the newer Asus RT-N13U B1. I am sure the B1 is faster than the 20year old WRT54G v2 ...</p><p><strong>UPDATE: 10:49 AM 11/13/2013 </strong><br />Ok so its not firmware .. same random issues with dd-wrt after a few days ... so swapped out the router with a different one .. will see if it still has issues. Did notice my &quot;weather direct&quot; gateway was blinking a LOT so I unplugged it and internal traffic started to respond ... so maybe its this stupid weather gateway gone crap. The wifi internal worked but internet and wired devices did not. running ye ole WRT54G v2.2 with the weather gateway unplugged ... will see how that goes ...</p><p><strong>UPDATE: 10:28 PM 11/8/2013 </strong><br />EDIT</p><p><strong>UPDATE: 9:26 PM 11/8/2013 </strong><br />So far its working here is what I did ...<br />* unplugged the cable modem<br />* changed the mac address on the wlan <br />* set the broadcast flag to on<br />* apply / save <br />* stop the interface ( Under network )<br />* start the interface <br />Make sure it has the -B option in the console ( ps |grep udhcpc )<br />OLD: udhcpc -p /var/run/udhcpc-eth0.2.pid -s /lib/netifd/dhcp.script -f -t 0 -i eth0.2 -H Windowsrouter -C<br />NEW: udhcpc -p /var/run/udhcpc-eth0.2.pid -s /lib/netifd/dhcp.script -f -t 0 -i eth0.2 -H Windowsrouter -C -B<br />* stop the interface<br />* plugged in the cable modem and waited for it to go online<br />* clicked the start interface<br />* got an IP instantly... </p><p>Not sure if it was the -B or maybe they fixed something on the Charter side but so far so good ...&nbsp; *Xs finger&#039;s*</p><p>* Charter<br />* the checking broadcast flag flag does not appear to do anything.<br />* I had filter put on my cable to block extended basic cable and after that its been wonky.. (with or without filter removed)<br />* I can plugin a windows laptop etc and get an IP address &#039;sometimes&#039;<br />* Openwrt will get the 192.168.100.XXX IP and then blank and then never get the new DHCP IP that gets it online.<br />* I will try the udhcpc -p /var/run/udhcpc-eth1.pid -s /lib/netifd/dhcp.script -f -t 0 -i eth1 -C -B but in my case I think its eth0.2 <br />* The mac address is different for the wan port then the ASUS MAC on the bottom of the router. I dont have the Openwrt mac on hand but maybe is one blacklisted from Charter... but then again it worked fine for like week or two with this firmware.<br />* it appears maybe somebody is scanning because in a short time I get flood of ARP from one mac and it appears to be in sequential order&nbsp; <a href="http://rmccurdy.com/scripts/downloaded/OPENWRT/.flood_arp.pcapng">http://rmccurdy.com/scripts/downloaded/ … arp.pcapng</a> I think 24.181.9.129 is doing the scanning and and&nbsp; 64:9e:f3:66:80:d9 is the gateway or something for that address even tho I was on a like 68.X.X.X address and nothing matched the ARP flood traffic I was getting.<br />* im running&nbsp; <a href="http://rmccurdy.com/scripts/downloaded/OPENWRT/">http://rmccurdy.com/scripts/downloaded/OPENWRT/</a> AA_WORKING_EXTROOT_LUCI_openwrt-ramips-rt305x-rt-n13u-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=40737">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=40737</a> <br />* I managed after a day to be online fine and then started pulling traffic for indexing usenet and maybe that or something else kicked me offline.</p><p>I think maybe a host one my node is doing scanning and making my whole termination system testy ... so when I push/pull traffic is drops me ... </p><p>I will update this post later after messing and testing different udhcpc flags ...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>killall udhcpc
