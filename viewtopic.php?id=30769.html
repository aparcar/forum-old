					<p>Hello. I believe I was banned from site and forum, because both ping and traceroute is OK, but I can not reach neither HTTP nor HTTPS services. Only anonymous proxy works for me. I never did anything wrong or abusing, so I believe this is a mistake.<br />Can I tell my IP via PM to the administrator to fix the problem?</p>									</div>
