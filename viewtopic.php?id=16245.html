					<p>Hi Guys,<br />First time poster, long time OpenWrt conception enthusiast. <br />(That is, like the idea of OpenWRT , but yet to get my hands dirty with it)</p><p>Iâ€™ve been digging around for a new router, as Iâ€™ve been a long time user of a D-Link DI-824VUP+ with an IPCOP Firewall between the Router and the cable modem for uses with the Squid Proxy server.</p><p>Iâ€™ve since passed the D-Link unit on, as I have a new member of the family arriving in a few weeks, thus Iâ€™ve had to move all computer setup and hardware out to the living room. <br />To save space and to keep the wife happy, limit the amount of clutter on the computer desk (abit hard with a 26&quot;&nbsp; LCD monitor + Thermaltake MozartTX case the size of a bar fridge on the desk)<br />Anyway, I was looking for a Four Port Gigabit Router with Wireless N and a USB port, with the hopes to port OpenWRT onto the device and use some sort of HTTP proxy with caching on it, and some sort of monitoring package for usage dumps etc.</p><p>I was very interested the Linksys WRT350 unit, but havenâ€™t heard the best reports about stability and reliability. On the other hand the Asus WL-700gE has everything in one box plus a bit more and double the ram of the Linksys. But only 10/100 and wireless G.</p><p>Now if the Linksys might do what Iâ€™m after, I have a Corsair Voyager GT 8GB USB Drive I can use as storage on the unit.<br />Else if itâ€™s a pain in the backside box, and happy to forgo gigabit Ethernet and wireless N for reliability with stability.<br />These are the feature after looking into a setup I would like to opt addons to install if possible.</p><p>Obviously the standard image with all the features, DHCP, QoS, Wireless support etc</p><p>Squid with caching (or alternative)<br />BitTorrent Client<br />TFTP<br />HTTP (small webserver if possible â€“ one to access reports + usage information and serve a small website on port 8080) Unsure but maybe X-wrt.org might have everything I need for that part?</p><p>Anything Else I might be able to squeeze in would be icing on the cake.<br />I just feel at the moment the ASUS would off the best expandability.<br />If only it had Gigabit and Wireless Faster than 54g.</p><p>Anyhoo, any thoughts or opinions would be great.<br />Also trying to find out which unit has the best throughput from WAN to LAN<br />As the old D-Link with IPCOP work like a charm, could download and seed, and play online games (once setup right in the router and IPCOP) without any noticeable drop in internet performance with online gaming, and multi user web browsing. Used the QoS in the DI-824VUP+ for the most part.<br />Anyway, thanks for your time.</p><p>Lookforward to any replies<br />Regards<br />Chris</p>									</div>
