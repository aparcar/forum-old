					<p>Trunk is not about jumping to the newest kernel. As you may have noticed, it&#039;s been on 3.14 for a while, and 3.18 for now. OpenWrt seems to align with the LTS kernels - which at the time of writing are 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14. And I guess 3.18 will be one as well.</p>									</div>

Happens when copying large amount of data to my 4TB Ext4 drive. Not rebooting, but going completely dumb. All connections going down, luci not working, cant log on via ssh, but the leds are still on. Must switch of and on manually to restart the router. I posted the issue here, but haven&#039;t received any reply.</p>									</div>
