					<p>Hello i have problem with OpenWRT hamachi port forward. i wanted to configure hamachi...&nbsp; Before soft modyfication i had ~100ms latency (was good).&nbsp; Without forwarding i have to high latency (about 300ms). Then i defined portforward for hamachi... And then hamachi lost connection with my friend&#039;s network. I cannot ping him.<br />My definition of portforward for hamachi:<br />17771 UDP&nbsp; (and my pc address?)<br />12975 TCP/UDP (same ip address of my pc)<br />32976 TCP/UDP. (up)</p><p>Why it doesn&#039;t work?? I need ur help. I was trying with other IP adresses (hamachi addres in home menu, my friend address). I don&#039;t wanna revert old software it is so poor.</p><p>Sorry for my english. I am not from UK,US or another ENG country.&nbsp; Thank you for ur answer.<br />My router is TP-LINK TL-WR740N.</p>									</div>
