					<p>- Buy a WLAN Router <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">supported by OpenWrt</a>.<br />- With the original firmware configure the router as you like - configure everything (internet access ets.) especially (802.1X aka RADIUS) authentication with an IP of 127.0.0.1 and password testing123.<br />- <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing">Install OpenWrt</a> and then do the following at its command line:<br />ipkg install nas<br />nvram set wl0_akm=wpa<br />ipkg install freeradius-mod-eap-tls<br />ipkg install freeradius-democerts<br />vi /etc/freeradius/eap.conf<br />Change line 22: md5 &gt; tls<br />Comment line 60, 61<br />Uncomment line 122, 123, 124, 130, 133, 135, 136, 147, 157, 178<br />vi /etc/freeradius/radiusd.conf<br />Uncomment line 660, 1629, 1735<br />ln -s /etc/init.d/radiusd /etc/init.d/S99radiusd<br />ipkg install ntpclient<br />ipkg install vsftpd<br />ln -s /usr/lib /usr/libexec<br />nvram commit<br />reboot</p><p>The SFTP server is for easy exchange of the certificates. You can choose anything else. Use a SFTP client on your computer and download /etc/freeradius/certs/cert-clt.p12 (Password: whatever) and /etc/freeradius/certs/demoCA/cacert.pem. Import these two files into the appropriate places. For example for Mac OS X: Macintosh HD &gt; Utilities &gt; Keychain Access &gt; File menu &gt; Import and then AirPort menu &gt; Other &gt; WPA Enterprise &gt; OK. Mac OS X will use the correct EAP type and the EAP-TLS certifactes automatically, so it is just: OK.</p><p>A complete test will fail, because the server certificate is out of date. Anyway you will have to replace everything in /etc/freeradius/certs/ with your own PKI data. See the various HowTos on the net for this step.</p><p>This is just a small lousy howto. There are better ways but this is a start. Just bought that router because I knew I could have EAP-TLS internal but I found no HowTo and it took a bit of time to figure out.</p><p><strong>Question 1</strong><br />Has anyone suceed with EAP-TLS with WEP (and not WPA)?</p><p>I /etc/init.d/radiusd stop and killall nas. Then start <em>nas</em> myself with 802.1X for WEP as said in the <a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/nas">documentation</a> as background process because OpenWrt&#039;s scripts have no support for it yet, then start radiusd -X. So far it works, my client finds the access point and starts a EAP-TLS session sucessfully with FreeRadius. Everything is fine: connected and usable.<br />But no re-keying happens. Played with the time parameters, nothing. Quite useless especially for insecure WEP...but I need WEP. Any idea?</p><p><strong>Question 2</strong><br />Could some one, please, add WEP+RADIUS support in /etc/init.d/S41wpa?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>traud</strong> on 22 Aug 2006, 13:58)</p>

					<p>Because if the openwrt box is not set to the right time, there can be revocation problems.

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>dl1cbp wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>why you need the time protocol</p></blockquote></div><p>A certificate has a validity. FreeRadius checks the validity for its own certificate and the clients. For example in my testing with the faulty demo certificates if I set date to 2005, it failed. Setting the router to 2004 worked, but the clients complained of course. Setting all to 2004 worked great. So go for your own certificates.</p><p>Do you have working re-keying on your network?

					<p>You can forget nvram totally when you use WEP+RADIUS because nas is not linked to nvram then. The script which reads nvram to start nas has no support for WEP+RADIUS yet. Or how do you create WEP+RADIUS? I have to start nas directly.</p><p>Personally I think the problem is nas - especially one of it parameters is wrong but I do not understand which one.</p><p>Just for the curious reader:<br />Just as described in the howto re-keying under WPA works.

					<p>This log is from xsupplicant. See above.

Early versions of xsupplicant also supported *BSD and Mac OS X, but this support was pulled out when xsupplicant&nbsp; was rewritten.</p><p>Perhaps you can find such an earlier Version.

If the cert is ok (signed with the private Key of the server) then the RADIUS gives ok to the NAS and he (the NAS) opens his Ports for the Client.</p><p>Thats the way I understood the thing - but maybe I&#039;m wrong in details...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dl1cbp</strong> on 20 Sep 2005, 12:56)</p>

					<p>You are right about <em>nas</em>. Just thought there might be something else because the docuementation says you need <em>nas</em> for WPA only. But I guess there is nothing else - was just a stupid asumption. So either <em>nas</em> in RC2/RC3 is faulty or we call it with wrong parameters.</p><p>Have I understood you correctly, the re-keying timing seems to follow parameter t? Have you played with parameter g? If that has no effect at all in the logs, we know at least for what parameter t is good for. OpenWrt seemed not to know yet.</p><p>Puzzling.
