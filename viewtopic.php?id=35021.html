					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wrote a guide on how to setup OpenVPN on OpenWRT. The wiki didnt outline it in a way that I understood so I decided to compile the information I found here.

					<p>Thanks a lot for the write up! I have one question, I cannot connect to the openVPN server from the external IP-Address even though I opened the port in the firewall. Do you have any suggestions? Or is this not possible</p><p>EDIT:<br />Nevermind, it seems that when you are connecting from within the network of the router itself, connecting through the external IP address doesn&#039;t work, but from another network (which I am using now) it does work perfectly fine!</p><p>EDIT2:<br />Though, with this configuration, is internet browsing going through the VPN as well? Still a bit green on VPN and all that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 8 Apr 2012, 22:38)</p>

So if you already have a set of keys, or build your keys on another machine, or use OpenVPN with simple &quot;secret&quot; password authentification (eek) then, yes, you don&#039;t need to install the easy-rsa module.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 8 Nov 2013, 01:48)</p>

					<p>Thank you delicatepc, </p><p>very nice tutorial after i followed the other tutorials that might be outdated a bit, luckely i found yours.

					<p>You may have the same or similar issue to what I have.&nbsp; Following this guide worked perfectly fine in Barrier Breaker, but in Chaos Calmer, the DNS lookup is not working, making access to Internet and local LAN devices inaccessible using device names or URL.</p><p>To resolve this issue, in /etc/config/openvpn, any route or DHCP options you&#039;re pushing to the vpn client, make sure to remove the &quot;list&quot; wordings, like:</p><p>push &quot;route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; #this should MATCH your current LAN info<br />push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 192.168.1.1&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #this should MATCH your current LAN info<br />push &quot;dhcp-option DOMAIN LOCALDOMAIN.LAN&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#this should MATCH your current LAN info<br />push redirect-gateway lan def1</p><p>This seems to resolve the issue for me in Chaos Calmer.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Folks for replying back to peers who had issues.</p><p>Since writing this guide its likely some of the values have been tweaked. As an example: @600cc the switch from [0/1] to [no/yes] as parameter value is likely a change in OpenVPN software itself. The guide is ~4 years old but the principle concepts should be similar.</p><p>Some work this guide needs:<br />- Update/testing to be in line with current versions.<br />- Testing to see if LuCi interface has matured enough to deal with Cert issuing, distribution and revoking.<br />- 2 Factor Authentication (integrating the Duo Platform looks to be a quick way)<br />- Notification on client connection to OpenVPN server (shell scripts look to be the way) <br />- Performance results on a modern SOC (something like Linksys AC1900/ACS)<br />- Integration into Wiki page if desired.</p>									</div>
