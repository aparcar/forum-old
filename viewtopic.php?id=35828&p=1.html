					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;m using dd-wrt for many years but with my new vdsl-isp-connection I have to switch to OpenWRT.</p><p>I need vlan tagging 7 and 8 for my isp connection. But I also need the 13th wlan channel. With the latest stable release I can&#039;t select channel 12 or 13 via Luci even if I select Germany as region domain.</p><p>I read via google that I have to build OpenWRT again and force the region domain. I also looked into the wiki and loaded the latest trunk via svn. But all these option massivly confusing me...</p><p>Is there a small guide for the 1043ND or can I load the latest generic trunk and install Luci?</p><p>I just need the wlan channels 12 and 13 and OpenVPN in the OpenWRT binary.</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>									</div>

					<p>It is complicated but it&#039;s also reasonable for OpenWRT to work this way and leave it to the user to sort it out.</p><p>The switch to US regulations occurs during boot as a result of TP-Link leaving it as US in the EEPROM regardless of where it is sold. The US strict restrictions cannot be revoked once they are set so after boot you can try change to DE but it won&#039;t allow it because it&#039;s already switched to strict US regulations.</p><p>What manufacturers are supposed to do is set the EEPROM for the country the item will be sold so for you in Germany they should set it to DE and then on bootup it switches to DE and you can use it happily.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>j8soot</strong> on 29 Mar 2012, 20:24)</p>

					<p>It should be possible to make a command that run &quot;iw reg set DE&quot; at the beginning of the boot.</p><p>I also have some atheros devices and have the same problem.

It might refuse to establish a 40MHz channel because it detected another network nearby. This is the 802.11 policy. Maybe even regulatory as well, not sure.</p><p>If you want to force HT40 you can add « option noscan 1 » to /etc/config/wireless (or « uci set wireless.radio0.noscan=1; uci commit » if you can’t operate vi.) </p><p>In that file it should also have « option country DE » now, which is where regulatory territory is set in Openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>towolf</strong> on 1 Apr 2012, 01:55)</p>

					<p>I changed the wireless channel from 13 to 1 in and wlan now works automatically at boot.</p><p>Until today I was using a modified regulatory.bin to work around the channel restrictions but this faulty build is using CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y instead.</p><p>I am not sure how to troubleshoot the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Very bad news. Is there a working workaround for this problem? Starts the wlan with the modified regulatory.bin? If it&#039;s working, can you send me the file?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am not so good at troubleshooting with OpenWRT yet so I am unsure how to proceed. I will try tonight with the modified regulatory.bin and if it doesn&#039;t work I&#039;ll build again without CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD and test regulatory.bin with the fresh build.</p><p>If you would like the modified file to test it just now I can email it.</p>									</div>
