					<p>Hey,I have dutifully looked through the documentation, and find little evidence of PPPoA support, unless it is disguised as something else? Perhaps one uses an appropriate pppd connect script? Though PPPoE seems to have its own seperate support, and PPPoA has always seemed to me to be an alternative equivalent... My isp only supports PPPoA, hence before migrating to this amazing firmware on an ADSL2MUE (or, a WRT54Gs v6 - though obviously I&#039;m less inclined due to greater risk), can anyone confirm PPPoA support and direct me to the appropriate documentation?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>PPPoA requires a totally different modem. I&#039;m not sure if the ADSL2MUE supports PPPoA with stock firmware, I doubt it does. You establish a PPP connection over ATM, not ethernet</p>									</div>

					<p>Dave, I&#039;ll try and clarify what&#039;s going on...</p><p>PPPoATM is a good match for a DSL line.&nbsp; There&#039;s a good argument ATM is superior to ethernet.</p><p>PPPoEthernet is more a glue protocol with tiny direct overhead.</p><p>Ethernet is everywhere, ATM is all but dead for average networks but lots of fiber is connecting the world with ATM.</p><p>Electrical ATM network interfaces are rare and 10-20-50 times the cost of ethernet (all because of volume, not technology).</p><p>Modems like the ADSL2MUE do NOT put ATM directly on a wire.&nbsp; It talks PPPoA protocol to the DSL line but ethernet (or USB) to the customer.&nbsp; ATM is never on a wire, it&#039;s only inside the modem firmware.</p><p>For this reason, forget a non-modem WRT router doing PPPoA.&nbsp; It has no ATM interface and ATM modems are rare (I have one - Alcatel 1000 ADSL vintage 1997).&nbsp; The reason for PPPoE existing is now clear - the world didn&#039;t switch from ethernet to ATM so ethernet had to do.</p><p>Now... in terms of how the ADSL2MUE does PPPoA the best I can imagine is finding someone that has already worked with it.&nbsp; LinkSys site has their open source code.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone has already adapted it to OpenWrt but that&#039;s a lot of modem interfacing not in a standard release.</p><p>HTH,</p><p>Bill</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 15 Jan 2007, 09:18)</p>

					<p>Tommy,</p><p>In order to get PPPoA working with OpenWRT (or similar firmware), you need a DSL modem that supports either PPTP Relay (like the older Speedstream 5660 &amp; Alcatel SpeedTouch series) or you need some kind of special firmware for the DSL modem that performs a pseudo-RFC1483 translation (similar to what Tachyon mentioned with the Actiontec).&nbsp; Neither feature is particularly common, unfortunately.</p><p>Do you know if the Speedstream 6250 supports PPTP Relay?&nbsp; (Note, this is *not* the same feature as PPTP passthrough.)</p>									</div>
