					<p>@davidc502, how do I use your builds on the wrt1900acs? </p><p>I installed your shelby NAND w/luci. It didn&#039;t port over all my configs from the kaloz build properly, wifi was disabled, lan works, and luci wasn&#039;t enabled. I had to ssh, install luci and enable websever. Looking at the WiFi configurations, there are two networks that are using a generic driver and two that are using the marvel driver. It seems the saved configs from the kaloz build had bound to the generic drivers, as they were the first two entries.</p><p>I ended up going back to the kaloz build for now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tekiwibird</strong> on 1 Feb 2016, 21:02)</p>

					<p>The builds are based on Trunk, so you should be able to update from trunk without any issues. However, any other builds, like Kaloz, it looks like there may be problems importing the configuration. &lt; Good to know</p><p>Not sure why you didn&#039;t get LuCi..

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>&nbsp; the NAND patch is the sum of the NAND timeout patch - I still occasionally would get the timeout issues on boot, even on 4.4 - and these: <a href="http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2015-November/063088.html;">http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/li … 3088.html;</a> mostly code cleanup and fixes for edge cases we should not hit on our boards.</p><p>&nbsp; There are another couple of patches circulating in the kernel list - I&#039;m reading them and figuring out if they bring in any benefits.
