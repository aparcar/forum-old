					<p>Hi all, i&#039;m managed to sucessfully run OpenWRT on ASUS DSL-N12U, but there is some issue i can&#039;t find way to solve for days.<br />It works greatly when flashed with Serial command, everything works (except DSL). I want to release it for people without Serial hardware.<br />Seems like it has patched U-Boot that don&#039;t flash entire memory when used with &quot;RESET&quot; key. But it works correctly if i choose this method on boot using Serial:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP.<br />In &quot;reset&quot; way it can&#039;t flash standart OpenWRT bin, it needs special header, i&#039;m added it by replacing OpenWRT mkimage utility with asus patched one from GPL source release. After doing it I managed to flash it using reset button, but seems like it writes only first 1MB of firmware and drops rest of it. It flashes faster and data partition is not flashed correctly, so system can&#039;t mount root.<br />I don&#039;t has much experience in porting firmwares, maybe i&#039;m just going the wrong way?</p>									</div>
