					<p>Hello! I&#039;m Marius and I&#039;m from a country with 1 Gbps Internet speed. Recent, I tried OpenWRT on a Tp-Link wr 1043nd V2, but at a speed test the result has awful. My speed was decreased at 300Mbps. It&#039;s any possibility to get my full speed?</p>									</div>

					<p>you can also reach gigabit speeds with atom board with at least 2.6ghz clock speed. Had one mine that has 8 cores and had 4 port gigabit nics (Intel based) which supports VLAN and LAN passthrough, so each port can work as a standard switch if you wanted to has ecc ram and the price is no where near buying a 5th gen intel processors.</p><p>no addon cards installed since all that I needed is on board.</p><p>not to mention that it always stays around 9watts (12wats at full cpu usage whcih is highly unlikely to happen) all the time with 15 watts at boot up.</p><p>dont have any wifi on the setup since I got a separate AP for that kind of task which is more reliable to be honest, you never go wrong with ubiquity AP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 14 Apr 2016, 16:21)</p>
