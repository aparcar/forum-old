					<p>This is a general question about the capabilities of OpenWRT</p><p>Disclaimer - this sounds dumb cause it is. I didn&#039;t create this problem, I can only work with what I&#039;ve been given. </p><p>I work in a school that connects to the internet via ADSL modem/routers made by TP-Link. I&#039;m aware that modem/routers aren&#039;t supported by openWrt - I&#039;m not trying to install it there. The problem is this: there is some kind of government regulation here (Kazakhstan) specifying how schools my buy their internet. Every modem/router is limited to a 512 Mbps connection - there is literally no amount of money that will make it go faster. What they do then is run tons of phone lines and currently have 5 ADSL connections in the school. There&#039;s another regulation of some kind that causes these to cost about 5 times as much as a private home connection. Whatever the reasoning the situation is this - I want to bring these connections together into one network. </p><p>My initial idea is as follows: place all 5 router/modems in one absurd looking stack and feed all of their LAN connections into one router that somehow sums together the available bandwidth by intelligently deciding which WAN connection to use. I think this would use similar intelligence to a MESH network minus it actually being a mesh. </p><p>So the question: If I had a router with OpenWRT connected to these 5 other routers could I configure it to do this? I&#039;m very new to OpenWRT and if the answer is just no way in hell go ahead and say so. I&#039;d love some help though - this question has me a bit stumped now. </p><p>I&#039;m able to get almost any router I need locally so this need not be a hardware dependent question - more on the capabilities of the software. </p><p>Thanks guys</p>									</div>

					<p>anybody? Look I&#039;m a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kazakhstan and I&#039;m trying to figure out how to branch out these ADSL connection so they&#039;re available to the students. If this is possible I&#039;d sure love to hear some thoughts. Thanks</p>									</div>
