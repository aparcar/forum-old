					<p>This is the question I already asked at the DD-WRT forums. I since migrated from DD-WRT to OpenWRT which is more stable on this router. I recieved no answer there so I will ask here also. The same problem exists with OpenWRT and I don&#039;t believe the the hardware is not capable of near to gigabit speed. Ignore the DD-WRT and optware parts.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I have recently bought a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH. Until now I was really pleased with the device. I installed &quot;DD-WRT v24-sp2 (08/07/10) std&quot; on it and it worked ok. Upon that I installed some of the Optware packages following this blog:</p><p><a href="http://g300nh.blogspot.com/2010/06/software-installation-on-dd-wrt-part-1.html">http://g300nh.blogspot.com/2010/06/soft â€¦ art-1.html</a></p><p>I configured samba and connected a 2TB ext3 disk to the USB on the router. Still everything was ok.</p><p>But then I decided to switch some parts of my LAN to gigabit. Namely my main desktop and my NAS storage. To my suprise the speed after upgrade was still the same. So I investigated. I used &quot;iperf&quot; to meassure the TCP throughput. First I meassured it between my desktop and NAS. The route was:</p><p>Desktop -&gt; Gigabit switch -&gt; Router -&gt; Gigabit Switch -&gt; NAS.</p><p>The speed was 10MB/s as it was before the upgrade. Then I meassured speed between NAS and some other server in the same room separated only by the switch. So:</p><p>NAS -&gt; Gigabit switch -&gt; Server.</p><p>The speed was 75MB/s whis is fine by me. Ok then I meassured the speed between my desktop and the router and between the server and the router. The connections were:</p><p>Desktop -&gt; Gigabit Switch -&gt; Router : 10MB/s<br />Server -&gt; Gigabit Switch -&gt; Router : 18MB/s</p><p>Ok so I thought the cables (CAT 5) were the problem. The last test should confirm that. I unpluged the server and brought it up to the router with the same CAT5 cable that achieved 75MB/s in the test before.</p><p>I pluged the server to the router directly (even no switch was present). And to my surprise the speed was the same: 18MB/s. The router is supposed to be gigabit and has a decent processor and a lot of RAM.</p><p>So what is wrong. Is DD-WRT causing problems or is the problem the hardware (hard to believe)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>izkacin</strong> on 17 Oct 2010, 10:14)</p>

					<p>It seems I have the same problem.</p><p>The cable I use before can get 1000Mbps between Router and PC using stock firmware. When I upgraded to OpenWRT, the connection working only in 100Mbps connection.</p><p>It seems the problem is in OpenWRT, IMHO.</p><p>What else information should I provide?</p>									</div>
