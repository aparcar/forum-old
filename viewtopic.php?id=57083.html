					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am using <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.tethering">Usb Tethering</a> from an android tablet to a tp-mr3420 running AA.&nbsp; It works well to provide internet for the entire network.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t think I understand the setup on a low enough level.</p><p>I can&#039;t access the network from another network using the external ip address.&nbsp; As in, I can&#039;t ping it from outside (even with pinging allowed).&nbsp; nmap reports the server is down.</p><p>The android device over usb decides its own ip address which is in a different subnet from my bridged lan.&nbsp; I thought I would be able to just pass things from wan =&gt; lan and make the android just a passthrough.&nbsp; However, I still haven&#039;t found a set up that allows access from the outside (even bridging lan and wan).</p><p>Is the android device acting too much like a router and blocking my requests?&nbsp; Or does anyone have any advice to help me?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wmattanderson</strong> on 29 Apr 2015, 17:03)</p>

					<p>You may be behind CG NAT... I use a dongle plugged in to a Banana Pi (so, in effect, the same as tethering) and get an IP in the 100.x.x.x range from my mobile provider. This means it can&#039;t be reached from &#039;outside&#039;. Of course, the Android may also be acting as a router. So you could be behind triple NAT.</p><p>To get round this one can, from the router, (1) use a VPN service like StrongVPN which supplies a fixed public IP as part of its service and gives it to your VPN endpoint / client (the router), or (2) get your own VPS / server with a public IP and set it up yourself.</p><p>I did (1) then migrated to (2).</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s a good point, I&#039;m not sure if Verizon is using carrier grade NAT or not.&nbsp; The IP address I get is 70.193.xx.xxx, are all CG NAT IP&#039;s in the 100.x.x.x?</p><p>Also if it is just the android NAT in my way should I be able to fix this problem with configuration on the openwrt router(possibly static routes or something)?</p>									</div>
