					<p>I just got a Buffalo WMR-300 and it&#039;s apparently supported (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wmr-300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wmr-300</a>).<br />My question now is, how to install OpenWrt on it. The wiki doesn&#039;t say anything and I would like to avoid cracking the thing open for serial access... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Did you find any way to flash your router?</p><p>I&#039;ve just get a WMR-300 too and I am also very new to OpenWrt. I searched around and got that you can upload the firmware on such wiki page via serial port, which means you have to open the case, do some work for connecting some serial port to the board.</p><p>To upload the firmware via TFTP, you have to download some firmware with &quot;tftp&quot; in or at the end of its name.</p><p>Can someone confirm my knowledge?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FreeCodeVN</strong> on 18 Jan 2015, 23:54)</p>

					<p>So I bought a Japanese version of WMR-300 (it converted to $19 USD so it was a GOOD deal).</p><p>However, I can&#039;t flash the US version of the firmware onto it. Digging a bit, it seems that the US firmware is 36 bytes larger. Furthermore, I found out that other routers by Buffalo are region locked. </p><p>Region-lock workarounds for other routers (<a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=745189">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=745189</a>) were unsuccessful for me. I think the only recourse left for me is to tftp into it.</p><p>My questions:<br />1) My understanding is that factory-released firmwares are NOT the same as ramfs versions, and that one needs to make the latter in some way. Is this correct?<br />2) If (1) is correct, is there a ramfs-generated version of a US factory firmware? My strategy at this point is to flash to ANY US version through tftp, then use the web-based interface to get to the latest (2.0) firmware. Of course if someone has a ramfs v2.0 firmware that&#039;d be great!<br />3) I don&#039;t really have the time to learn how to decrypt and compile my own ramfs version of the factory firmware, unless someone can point me to a clearly-written set of instructions. Life&#039;s been busy lately and this is my first foray into dd/OpenWRT so I&#039;m a bit apprehensive<br />4) My other recourse is to keep screencaps of the English Router Configuration Pages on my tablet so that I can access them when I travel. So yeah I don&#039;t REALLY need to convert to English but...it&#039;d be nice!</p>									</div>
