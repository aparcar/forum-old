					<p>You will laugh. , but I am probably one off the few who do not like the http page (yet), I think that if there is a http page with a login possibility, hackers or members off my wireless group&nbsp; will try even more to open the wrt. Further is the failsafe not working as it was doing before, to get into failsafe I need to open the wrt and connect the pins?. disconnecting the power and press the button did not bring me back into failsafe, or did I make an mistake?<br />I like the setting as it was before, other people could not do a reset &quot;by accident&quot;<br />The reset button is now actually a normal reset button again am I right? that will mean that I will have to help (visit) more people in the future to get them online again.<br />Wifidog gave me some problems as well, the only wifidog I got working on white Russian was a downloaded mipsel, not the one that I hade compiling.</p><p>I am very happy with openwrt, but not sure if the newest one is helping me. time will show</p>									</div>
