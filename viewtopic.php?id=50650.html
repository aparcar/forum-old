					<p>Hi,<br />I have a question is it possible to use DNSmasq only for local hosts?</p><p>My situation is:<br />I have a private server and I use my router to change public to local IP&nbsp; on LAN,<br />In my work we have multiple servers and the same procedure: we use local DNS to change IP of servers to local.</p><p>In both cases the local access is required to use non-public ports of servers.</p><p>My problem is: when I connect though VPN to my home I have:<br />local IP of my server and public of work servers.</p><p>Is there a way to query VPN DNS only for local hosts?</p>									</div>
