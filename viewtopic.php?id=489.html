					<p>I added a patch today that should support iptables configurations where the default policies don&#039;t match the requirements stated in the linux-igd docs, e.g. <br />Shorewall, by adding a FORWARD entry in the filter table along with the standard PREROUTING entry in the nat table.</p><p>If anyone uses this package let me know how it goes, and BTW if you are a linux user liek me and wondering why you&#039;d want this, most of the latest bittorrent clients have support for UPnP and it can make a huge difference.</p>									</div>

					<p>From what I understand the problems with UPnP w.r.t. security are that it lacks any authentication - for something that can change your firewall rules this is in general a bad thing.</p><p>First of all I would suggest using a stricter set of firewall rules than the default, e.g. something like shorewall (although it takes a bit of configuration to get UPnP working with shorewall, have to create a new zone for broadcast address, etc). UPnP really has be restricted to trusted users somehow.</p><p>To quote from the linux-igd SECURITY file:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>UPnP version 1.0, of which this program is based, is inherently flawed.&nbsp; As<br />with most Microsoft supported software, there was a lot of theory put out <br />there, but no code.&nbsp; Well what happened is they made attempt to get this<br />concept of UPnP out there, and in the inital version they weren&#039;t concerned<br />with security or any advanced controls.&nbsp; Simply all they wanted was<br />connectivity.&nbsp; So we are stuck with this for now.&nbsp; The UPnP server, by itself, <br />does no security checking.&nbsp; If it recieves a UPnP request to add a portmapping<br />for some ip address inside the firewall, it just does it.&nbsp; This program will <br />attempt to verify the source ip contained in the UPnP request against the<br />source ip of the actualy packet, but as always, these can be forged.&nbsp; The<br />UPnP server makes no attempt to verify this connection with the caller, and<br />therefore it just assumes whoever asked is the person really wanting it.<br />Theoretically this could open up ports on some other box than the caller to<br />the outside world, and this is where intelligent decision making comes in. <br />If you restrict the ability of this to happen with iptables rules, then this<br />becomes a non-issue, and only the machines that iptables allows to have stuff<br />go to will be allowed.&nbsp; But sure, everyone can come up with some way to get<br />around this so listen.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think OpenWrt&#039;s philosophy is to give users the choice, and certainly on of the features a lot of users want is UPnP as this is available on almost every other wireless router nowadays. As long as your firewall is resonably setup this isn&#039;t much of an issue, but like all other things security, ignorance of how to use the daemon properly is the greatest risk.</p>									</div>

					<p>How do you use Shorewall with current OpenWRT build? It doesn&#039;t include iptables-saverestore functionality and Shorewall takes forever to load without saverestore.

					<p>Well, I figured out what was going wrong with the linksys UPNP. After downloading the source code, I realised it was trying to set iptables entries with the contents of wan_ipaddr, which wasn&#039;t correct. I used /usr/sbin/nvram to set it to 0.0.0.0 and that made the iptables entries correct.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t want to spoil anything, but the linux-igd package from sourceforge has serious security flaws. With a specially crafted UPnP packet it is possible to turn the router into a forwarder for an attacker by setting the parameter &quot;NewInternalClient&quot; to an external IP address. The Broadcom UPnP code (as used on the WRT54G and WRT54GS) suffers from a similar bug, which is trivial to abuse for anyone/anything on your LAN. Linksys released new code for the WRT54GS recently to address this problem.</p>									</div>
