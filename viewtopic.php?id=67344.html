					<p>Looking at the wiki those instruction look off. After step 7 you are done recovering the bootloader or you wouldn&#039;t land at the Marvell prompt after step 8. Sure you might still need to fix the environment or flash a firmware image if they are corrupted or broken.</p><p>So my advise, ignore step 9 till 11. Follow &quot;Corrupt Environment Recovery&quot; respectively &quot;Serial Firmware Flash&quot; if you have to or just let the device boot otherwise.</p>									</div>
