					<p>Installed software packages are by default stored in the flash so that they stay there after you turn the power off.&nbsp; However, with a USB drive you can have your system&#039;s root directory onto it (look up &quot;extroot&quot; in the wiki) and then have basically unlimited space to install packages.&nbsp; Captured data can also be stored there or, by a variety of methods, sent directly to another computer.&nbsp; </p><p>The amount of software that can be running at one time is limited by the space it takes in RAM.&nbsp; If you&#039;re buying a new router for this, consider a model with at least 64 MB of RAM.</p>									</div>
