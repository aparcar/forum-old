					<p>Hello everybody. Mi name&#039;s Javier and I&#039;m from Spain.<br />I have a Fon Router with kamikaze installed and I&#039;d like to make my own packages. I&#039;d spend some days looking and reading posts, tutorials, etc about how to compile packages.<br />I follow <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/docs/openwrt.html#x1-460002.1.2">this tutorial</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/BuildingPackagesHowTo">this one</a> too and finished I was able to compile a small hello world (spanish version, of course <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />) and make the corresponding ipk package. I send this package to my router by ssh and when I try to install I obtain this out:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ipkg install /mnt/holamundo_0.1.1-1_mips.ipk 
Installing holamundo (0.1.1-1) to root...
Nothing to be done
An error ocurred, return value: 28.
Collected errors:
Only have 0 available blocks on filesystem /, pkg holamundo needs 18</code></pre></div><p>I think this is because the package is compiled as part of the firmware image, so it&#039;s going to install all files in /bin instead of /jffs/bin (I think, but I&#039;m not sure), so my question is: How can I compile a package regardless the firmware image? I&#039;ve seen that if I write my Makefile in kamikaze/package/holamundo (p.e), when I try to compile, it says that this package is skipping, so I must tu run make menuconfig, choose this package, save configuration and try to recompile again, obtaining the out I wrote before when I try to install the final package.</p><p>So I think I need some kind of config file, but I don&#039;t know what file and I don&#039;t know where to see. Anybody can help me please?<br />Thanks and advance.</p><p>Javier</p>									</div>

					<p>My first post and my first auto-reply....</p><p>looking in the web I found that /etc/ipkg.conf holds information about where to install the packages. In order to install the packages into the /jffs directory as root, the line<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dest root /jffs</code></pre></div><p>must be defined into the file, so ipkg can install the package into jffs filesystem.</p><p>Well, my &quot;holamundo&quot; works ok.</p><p>thanks anyway. I hope to contribude in this forum as I learn.</p><p>P.D: All doubts and comments about this things must be posted in &quot;develop&quot; it isn&#039;t true?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>javieralso</strong> on 14 Mar 2009, 00:47)</p>
