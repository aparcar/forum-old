					<p><span class="bbu">Problem:</span></p><p>I have a Meraki running 7.09. I am trying to use it is a wireless bridge. The access point I am connecting to is in a gateway mode and does not like my bridge. It will drop packets if they do not originate from the bridges MAC address.</p><p><span class="bbu">Goal:</span></p><p>I need to be able to connect a single client to the wired port of my wireless bridge and let it out on the network. I can not make the bridge into a router due to the nature of the network.</p><p><span class="bbu">My Progress:</span></p><p>I have used ebtables to SNAT outbound traffic to the MAC address of the bridge. This works great If the machine behind the bridge knows the MAC address it is connecting to. Since ARP requests have the source MAC address listed twice (Layer 2 and 3) my ARP requests always fail. I found the &quot;--snat-arp&quot; option that corrects the ARP request automagically, but that is only available in ebtables version 2.0.8-rc3 and later. OpenWRT is up to 2.0.8-rc2-2. I would compile it myself if I knew what I were doing. I have also played with the wireless in station mode which doesn&#039;t seem to get me any further than I already am.</p><p>Does anyone have any insight into this problem? Suggestions?</p><p>Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>
