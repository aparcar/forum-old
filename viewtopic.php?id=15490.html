					<p>Hi group,<br /> I have been trying to figure out how to make my WRT54Gs into a wireless bridge.<br />I have some WAP45Gs that do this very well but I could not get settings out of them<br />because I could not ssh into them. So I upgraded the firmware on one WAP with<br />OpenWRT. That worked, kind of! I could ssh into it, but there was no WEB interface.<br />If I tried to do any changes, I got &#039;no space on device&#039;. </p><p>&nbsp; I tweaked it so much now, I can&#039;t get into it anymore.&nbsp; It will boot but can&#039;t do anything with it. It will do the tftp upload but then does not complete the reimaging. There are no<br />open ports anymore (nmap).</p><p>&nbsp; I think what I need is a way of clearing the file system? Does the hard reset used on the <br />WRTs work with a WAP? Or is there an image that I can upload that will clear the disk?</p><p>&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to worry about the warranty, it&#039;s 3 years old.</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for your time.</p>									</div>
