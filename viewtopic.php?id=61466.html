					<p>3G-6200N - RaLink Rt3050 802.11bgn radio only works on 20Mhz. It should do 40Mhz, I am getting 65Mbit next to the router. (It should do up to 150Mbit). Is this a bug? Is there a solution? Can I help by providing any information?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

Perhaps it is a small thing but it just seems to make OpenWRT inferior/ more difficult to use compared to other device firmwares.</p><p>Thanks,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yurtesen</strong> on 12 Dec 2015, 23:50)</p>

I was a bit hasty to decide this was a bug. But OpenWrt does not have Wi-Fi certification anyway, and many wi-fi certified APs fail to conform to it based on the article you mentioned (and my tests also). I can only imagine that manufacturers are trying to please their customers, so why OpenWrt shouldnt...<br />But thank you for the link to the article. It was very informative.
