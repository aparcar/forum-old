					<p>Hi,<br />I have a ASUS WL-500gP v1 with OpenWrt and it&#039;s running fine. However, I&#039;m not able to capture photos with a usb webcam larger than 640x480 pixels even if my webcams support 1280x960 and 1600x1200 (Logitech and Creative UVC cameras). I have tried fswebcam and mjpeg-streamer and both just defaults down to 640x480 if I choose any resolution above it. Is there any configuration I can do to change this?</p><p>I&#039;m using Barrier Breaker but have also tried Chaos Chalmer but I didn&#039;t feel it was as stable. The same problem has been since Attitude Adjustment.</p><p>I&#039;m also using a 4G USB LTE modem (Huawei e398) and I can only get about 5,6Mbit/s even if my network gives about 12Mbit/s maximum. I had the same maximum speed with 3G also. This I don&#039;t care that much about but I would like to get higher resolution from the webcam.</p>									</div>
