					<p>Hello,&nbsp; </p><p>I have a very strange usecase and wonder if anyone knows if it is supported.</p><p>I would like to connect a client device via Wifi to a the OpenWRT device, that OpenWRT device to be connected to another WiFi network (different SSID from client device).&nbsp; The connection from the OpenWRT device should be running an IPSec VPN that will funnel all packets through the IPSec tunnel.</p><p>I know this is a strange use case but what I am trying to do is put all packets from a Windows phone that does not support IPSec VPN into an IPSec VPN tunnel.</p><p>To put it another way, here is how the pakcets would flow:</p><p>Windows Phone all packets via Wifi SSID1 to Router ----&gt; Router all pakcets for SSID1 to IPSec/Tunnel Interface ----&gt; Tunnel Interface all packets to SSID2 ----&gt; VPN server </p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
