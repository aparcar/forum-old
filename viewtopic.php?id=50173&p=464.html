Another member had a great suggestion about adding a &quot;Code Name&quot; column into the hardware tables for the 4 WRT1X00AC/S Series routers, however I wasn&#039;t sure if this would be allowed or not since it may disrupt the continuity of the hardware tables templates 

tmo@jabber.ccc.de [05/24/16-15:25:11]: Hi JW
tmo@jabber.ccc.de [05/24/16-15:25:18]: how many devices have a code name
tmo@jabber.ccc.de [05/24/16-15:25:28]: how many of roughly 1100 devices

jw0914@dukgo.com [05/24/16-15:27:00]: That was my line of thinking, as I assume the hardware pages have a template and that template is followed across all devices.   I did at least want to ask as I said I would

tmo@jabber.ccc.de [05/24/16-15:27:22]: it&#039;s a question of usefulness: If only few devices have a codename, then the big tables will have mostly empty columns.

jw0914@dukgo.com [05/24/16-15:28:47]: I was thinking along the same lines as well.   Thanks for taking the time =]

tmo@jabber.ccc.de [05/24/16-15:29:27]: Yes, following the template is essential for the ToH to be useful. Fields that are present in only a few devices/data entries will result in mostly empty columns; and in the end, we have customers who expect all fields to be available in all data entries, so they can search the whole database.
