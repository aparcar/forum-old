					<p>Hello!<br />I&#039;m trying to use pptp for creating persistent VPN client-mode connetion on WhiteRussian 0.9<br />Everything seems to run just fine, except one condition:</p><p>When remote point denies connection(remote AAA service is down, or anything else), pppd prints what &quot;Authentication failed&quot;, then sleeps a while and tries to establish new connection using new pty!<br />i.e. first time it uses /dev/pts/0, second - /dev/pts/1, etc, etc, till the /dev/pts/255<br />after that point router becomes unreachable from ssh connection, and only way to breing it to work - reboot.</p><p>my pptp options are:<br />root@rud-76:/etc/ppp/peers# cat /etc/ppp/options.pptp<br />debug<br />idle 0<br />defaultroute<br />maxfail 0<br />persist<br />noipdefault</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>i have had similar issues, i would be interested to know how to fix! when the link between me and server dies (ie my adsl goes down), then when adsl is back up and the pptd connection tries to reastablish but most of the time it fails with the issue you mentioned.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>g18c</strong> on 6 Jul 2007, 13:58)</p>

If you have any experience with OpenVPN client on OpenWrt or L2TP client i would love to hear from you in my thread in this same forum <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
