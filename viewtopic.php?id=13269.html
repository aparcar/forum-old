					<p>I forgot to say that I didn&#039;t download anything from the web site but instead built my own kamikaze 7.09. it is very simple, look into kamikaze documentation for svn addresses to download from, then you just do make menuconfig and create your kernel, squashfs and jffs2 images. You will also have to make sure your madwifi is using ap30 profile instead of ap51.</p><p>I really don&#039;t know why your red led is flashing. Try and do fis init -f (-f for format) and re-load everything from the beginning. Also try with root.jffs2-64k as well. You ARE using .gz kernel, right?</p><p>After you do fis init -f do fis free to see what&#039;s available. Do fis free after each step. I still have this 100000 block available after I&#039;m done but it&#039;s not contiguous with the 280000 block. Maybe there is a way to fix that but right now my priorities are elsewhere - I will get back to this issue once I&#039;ve sorted everything else out <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
