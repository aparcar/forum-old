					<p>Hello my name is Nick, I have a ZTE ZXHN H108NS and I want to &quot;break&quot; it. The main reason that I want to do this is that I want to change my SNR in order to get a better Download speed. I see that this isn&#039;t on the model list of Routers.<br />One year ago I tried to break it with another program that&#039;s not work and with cmd but I didn&#039;t succeed ! If someone can help me I am a newbie in this field !</p>									</div>
