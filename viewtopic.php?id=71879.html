					<p>OpenWRT - Designated Driver<br />Hardware - Freescale i.MX 6, arm71 based SBC</p><p>I&#039;ve cycle through a couple different usb celluar modems that use the cdc_ncm driver, and I see what appears to be instability in the usb connection to the device. </p><p>the following message is logged by the kernel:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[16595.645155] cdc_ncm 1-1:1.6 wwan0: network connection: disconnected</code></pre></div><p>and I have to reinitialize the data connection on the modem. In most cases, it recovers.</p><p>Is this type of behavior common, and something I need to work-around?</p><p>Please note that I have seen it across many different modems (10+) of two different types using two different SBCs.</p><p>(I can provide dmesg, lsusb, etc info if that is useful. Seems like not, though)</p><p>Thanks for the info!<br />Sam</p>									</div>
