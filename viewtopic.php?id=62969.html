					<p>I am trying to use openwrt backfire as a wireless extender in order to create an emergencial connection. </p><p>I created 2 interfaces under network / wifi / wifi0. The first one is set to access point and network=lan. The second one is set to client and has network blank. Both are WPA/WPA2 mixed encryption. </p><p>Through SSH and iwconfig I can see that the client interface correctly associates with the correct access point (I get ESSID and Access Point MAC on iwconfig) , but just briefly. A couple of seconds later the client interface switches to one of the many non-functional passwordless access points around.</p><p>How do I enforce it to stay on the right access point? </p><p>This is driving me crazy... :-( It was supposed to be an emergency measure to temporarily recover from a broken cable.</p>									</div>

					<p>Backfire is <em>really</em> old, so I don&#039;t know how much current documentation still applies. In current OpenWrt, you set the bssid option of the client (STA) interface to the MAC address of the access point you want to connect to. See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">doc/uci/wireless</a>.</p>									</div>

Given these baseline specifications, I don&#039;t see a problem with running current OpenWrt versions (both the CC release branch or trunk) on that particular router. While the webinterface might not be a runner, it should work and still fullfill routing/ AP needs just as well as it did a decade ago with older OpenWrt versions. Just that today&#039;s requirements tend to be slightly more involved, making a hardware upgrade certainly desirable.</p><p>I still use an Asus WL-500gP (with retrofitted ath5k wlan) occassionally for testing (trunk snapshots and-) larger configuration changes, before deploying them to (newer) production routers and it&#039;s still quite fine.</p>									</div>
