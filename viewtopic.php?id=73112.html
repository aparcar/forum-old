					<p>I need some help.&nbsp; I am new to this and apparently know just enough to be dangerous.&nbsp; I am going to try to use the right words and descriptions but I will probably miss speak.&nbsp; I was able to use the file &quot;openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory&quot; to load Openwrt onto my WR940N.&nbsp; It was fully functional I believe but somehow as I played with the configuration I managed to make it so I cannot log into the router.</p><p>When I plug the WAN port into my primary router it works as an access point but uses a completely different 172.16.12.x as opposed to 10.0.0.x.&nbsp; When connected to this router I can login to my primary router but when I use the address showing as my gateway IP I get a login that looks like my Netgear login and not Openwrt.</p><p>I tried to use the fail safe mode but that didn&#039;t seem to work. I realize that is pretty time sensitive so I might just need to try that more times to try and get it right.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried no username or password, Admin and Root as the username and every possible combination of passwords I can think of.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; </p><p>After reading about using Telnet to access a bricked router I tried that as well but no luck.&nbsp; My computer just said it was trying to connect.&nbsp; After 10 minutes or so I closed the window.</p><p>I&#039;m hoping that with lots of help form all of you I can figure out how to fix this.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help!</p>									</div>
