					<p>Maybe you can solve your basic problems more quickly reading the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org">http://wiki.openwrt.org</a>/</p><p>About your specific case:<br />maybe you haven&#039;t your root password set, so you have to use telnet (if you are using Windows, telnet is included, just type &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot; on your prompt command) and type &quot;passwd&quot; to set your root password.</p>									</div>

					<p>I connected a different laptop to the router and I was able to get a login screen. On the second laptop I was prompted by zonealarm which allowed me to access. On the orginal laptop which also has zonealarm I was not prompted so maybe it is my firewall that is blocking the session on the first computer. It prompts me for a username and then a password. Is this a temporary username and password or is it asking for the same username and password I put in the web gui. I was afraid to enter anything to mess up the password I had setup previously. Nevermind I used the password I setup and I am in. thx</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dallascowboysworldchamps</strong> on 28 Aug 2007, 11:13)</p>

					<p>I have wpa 2, but in the web gui I have this blue bar at the bottom which underneath apply changes clear changes and reveiw changes. It gets in the way of setting wpa 2 you can barely see where you set it to AES and you can see the password field but you cant see above it. The bar gets in the way and you cant see. Anyway to get rid of this or this a glitch in the gui. I have wpa2 setup now. I did learn how to install and remove a package.
