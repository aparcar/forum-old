					<p>I&#039;ve got a wired network on 192.168.1.0/24 and a wireless on 192.168.2.0/24. I wanna be able to print from my phone, which is on the 192.168.2.0/24 network, to a printer, which is on the 192.168.1.0/24 network. I&#039;ve already got port 9100 forwarded, and so I can print from my laptop on the wireless using that.</p><p>The problem is that the Android printer driver I need to use on my phone won&#039;t just manually print to an IP/port. It&#039;s obvious waiting for some broadcast to arrive in order to know how to locate the printer (and there&#039;s no option to manually configure the printer -- I looked and there are literally no settings at all for this particular Android printer driver). And, in fact, a run of &quot;tcpdump -n &quot;broadcast or multicast&quot;&quot; verifies that the printer is regularly broadcasting to 224.0.0.252 and 239.255.255.250.</p><p>How can I get these broadcasts sent out on the wireless? I played around with igmpproxy a bit, and so far I haven&#039;t gotten the broadcasts to show up on my laptop running tcpdump on its wireless interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi SpiderNuts,</p><p>I&#039;m not an expert on this topic but since I have a similar challenge (wanting to forward streaming (video/audio) data across my OpenWRT router I try to be of (some/little) help. Here&#039;s what &quot;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses/multicast-addresses.xhtml">http://www.iana.org/assignments/multica â€¦ sses.xhtml</a>&quot; tells me:<br />- 224.0.0.0/4 = IPv4 multicast; 224.0.0.0/24 = Local Network Control Block, should not be forwarded by routers, so I would not expect those frames on your WiFi subnet &quot;by design&quot; (unless I missinterpret IANA);<br />- 239.0.0.0/8 = Organization Local Scope multicast; frames in this range may be routed within your home network; unfortunately, I myself don&#039;t know yet how to configure that on OpenWRT.<br />- 239.255.255.250 = Simple Service Discovery Protocol, UDP based, can be used to announce (printing and other) services; part of the UPnP suite. Here&#039;s where our interests come together.</p><p>I&#039;ll follow your topic with interest. Good luck.</p><p>Steijn van Essen</p>									</div>

					<p>Without installing / implementing &#039;relayd&#039;, as eduperez responded (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=308476#p308476">here</a>) the printer&#039;s response to the Android device&#039;s web service discovery is directed to the &#039;wired&#039; (LAN-side) IP address (192.168.1.0/24) of the AP, which is summarily dropped by said AP.</p><p>The laptop when associated with the AP (192.168.2.0/24) &#039;knows&#039; where to send it&#039;s data (port 9100) and does not issue a web service discovery request (to locate the printer).</p><p>In brief, &#039;relayd&#039; is the only solution when LAN devices need to respond to WLAN (AP) devices.</p>									</div>
