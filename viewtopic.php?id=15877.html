					<p>I was wondering if anyone has done or setup the following in OpenWrt?&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s entirely possible but wanted to know if anyone has a similar setup before I attempt to build it out.</p><p>Hopefully the information on the picture is detailed enough but basically I wanted to use the wireless side of the WRT54GL&#039;s to be a routed link between two different local subnets which each WRT54GL has their own Internet connection for each WAN port.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.xdtalk.com/images/wrt54gl_routed_wireless.png" alt="http://www.xdtalk.com/images/wrt54gl_routed_wireless.png" /></span></p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>Cheers,<br />Kermee</p>									</div>

					<p>Didn&#039;t do that way, only with one WAN, but it&#039;s doable.<br />In /etc/config/network and wireless,<br />- Remove bridging from ethernet and wl ports on both<br />- Configure one wrt as AP, the other one as client, static IPs (the WWAN interfaces)<br />- Setup routing between them: left wrt: route add -net 192.168.20.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.0.0.2<br /> right wrt:&nbsp; route add -net 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.0.0.1<br />- Make sure firewalling is setup properly. I used shorewall, a bit slow on wrts</p><p>If you&#039;re very cool, use quagga/ospf for routing: If one of the WANs goes down, everybody uses the other one still up.</p>									</div>
