					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve got TP-LINK TL-WR841N v8.4 with lastest TP-LINK firmware. <br />My questions are: <br />1. When I update the firmware what is a change to delete U-boot from chip? Is it safe to update if I have serial console ? <br />2. Does dd-wrt and any firmware like openwrt/tomato/gargoyle &quot;touch&quot; the bootloader and if something goes wrong I can always recover device with serial console or there are some doors to loose my bootloader? </p><p>Which version of openwrt is the best for v8.4 and have working client mode ?</p><p>Thanks and sorry for my bad english</p>									</div>

					<p>your uboot is safe unless you do some tp-link upgrade, that usually updates also uboot -.-</p><p>version.. trunk works better but can have bugs, AA has bugs for sure ( wifi not stable 100% ) but it&#039;s safer if you do not have serial...</p>									</div>

					<p>you can damage uboot and art by typing random addresses in erase command from uboot prompt, but you can&#039;t from openwrt since it has write protection on those partitions.</p>									</div>
