					<p>Additionally, if I just surf the Net or retrieve e-mails, the AP association stays up all day (&gt; 8 hours) easily. When I stress the baby with a BT download of Fedora DVD image, it crumbles into this weird state. The BT download involves hundreds, even thousands at times, of connections, with port forwarding (really &quot;host forwarding&quot; due to <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=60824#p60824/">Port forwarding stops working after a while</a>).</p><p>My Buffalo box running dd-wrt v23 sp2 has no trouble with the download.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to rule out the possibility of fragile hardware as the root cause. In the meantime, does anybody successfully BT-download stuff with the 2.4 version of Kamikaze/7.09? How about the 2.6 version?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, exobyte, for your reply. I forgot to say earlier: my WiFi ISP is &quot;open&quot; (at least to allow an instance of association and an IP address).
