					<p>Hello everyone</p><p>I tried to build OpenWrt firmware for Lenovo-Y1S (MT7620) but I failed several times,<br />I have noticed the Warning messages in build.log like this:</p><p>WARNING: Image file /home/labasky/openwrt/build_dir/target-mipsel_24kec+dsp_musl-1.1.15/linux-ramips_mt7620/tmp/openwrt-ramips-mt7620-ex2700-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin is too big</p><p>when this Warning messages appear, then build process will be terminated and force exited soon,<br />and after that I check bin directory I can see:</p><p>labasky@labasky-Lenovo-B590:~/openwrt/bin/ramips$ ls -al<br />總計 15628<br />drwxr-xr-x 3 labasky labasky&nbsp; &nbsp; 4096 10月 22 06:39 .<br />drwxr-xr-x 3 labasky labasky&nbsp; &nbsp; 4096 10月 22 06:05 ..<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 labasky labasky 7995392 10月 22 06:39 openwrt-ramips-mt7620-ArcherC20i-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 labasky labasky 7995392 10月 22 06:39 openwrt-ramips-mt7620-ArcherC50-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />drwxr-xr-x 6 labasky labasky&nbsp; &nbsp; 4096 10月 22 06:17 packages</p><p>there are only 2 openwrt-xxxx-sysupgrade.bin here,<br />the build process didn&#039;t produce the firmware I need for my router (Lenovo Y1S)<br />I didn&#039;t find a file with a name like openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-Lenovo-y1s-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on , so I keep checking build.log,<br />and I found the log messages about the size of Kernel uImage here:</p><p>Image Name:&nbsp; &nbsp;MIPS OpenWrt Linux-4.4.14<br />Created:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tue Oct 18 09:42:06 2016<br />Image Type:&nbsp; &nbsp;MIPS Linux Kernel Image (lzma compressed)<br />Data Size:&nbsp; &nbsp; 1179781 Bytes = 1152.13 kB = 1.13 MB<br />Load Address: 80000000<br />Entry Point:&nbsp; 80000000</p><p>and I noticed the kernel mtd partition limiation for Netgear EX2700 seems to be 960 KB</p><p>so is the main reason of failed build process?<br />the produced kernel size is 1179781 Bytes = 1152.12 KB and it&#039;s bigger than 960KB<br />I don&#039;t know the detail about OpenWrt build process , <br />but It seems like produce all of the firmware for the same SOC(MT7620 series)<br />one by one , and if the procedure goes wrong , in one of them, <br />then will break whole build process for remaining firmwares<br />(I don&#039;t know my suspicion is right or wrong , please teach me more)</p><p>but the only firmware I want to gain is Lenovo Y1S<br />I don&#039;t have Netgear EX2700 and I don&#039;t want build its firmawre too.<br />so I have some questions here:</p><p>Q1:what&#039;s the main reason of failed build process? becase of the produced kernel image size bigger than 960KB?<br />&nbsp; and that exceed the limitation of mtd kernel partition of Netgear EX2700, so build process can not go any further, <br />then it stopped and didn&#039;t wanna produce more mt7620-series firmwares? </p><p>Q2: may I build OpenWrt firmware only for Lenovo Y1S, just for it, no more related openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-xxxxxx-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>Q3: If I select many packages as &lt;*&gt; in &#039;make menuconfig&#039; GUI, and finally I get a huge Kernel larger than standard flash layout , may I modify the default flash layout for my larger kernel image can fit in? and how to do that?<br />what config file should I modify? and how should I modify it?</p><p>any suggestion will be appreciated<br />and sorry for my poor English skill. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>A1: Yes if it&#039;s to big no image will be produced, chances you would be able to boot it are close to nil.</p><p>A2: Looks like it&#039;s not exposed in menuconfig, just override it with your make command, ie<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make -j5 V=s TARGET_DEVICES=y1s</code></pre></div><br /><p>A3: Custom flash layouts are possible but I suggest to only start looking into it after you have figured out how to recover your device when the flash is completely wiped.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well you will have to meddle with the bootloader and the kernel, also forget to ever use sysupgrade.</p><p>It involves far more than changing some config file. You will have to hack some code in various places.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok , maybe modify mtd layout is to difficult for a newbie<br />thank you dear sera<br />now I tried to build firmware for Lenovo y1s only, <br />with your suggestion command</p><p>make -j5 V=s TARGET_DEVICES=y1s</p><p>the build process has done successfully, <br />and after flash it into y1s router everything works fine</p><p>one more question, If I try to build image with ImageBuilder (because I want to write config files into squashfs)<br />I realized when I run &#039; make info&#039;<br />I only got this messages:</p><p>Current Target: &quot;ramips (MT7620 based boards)&quot;<br />Default Packages: base-files libc libgcc busybox dropbear mtd uci opkg netifd fstools uclient-fetch logd kmod-leds-gpio kmod-gpio-button-hotplug wpad-mini swconfig kmod-rt2800-pci kmod-rt2800-soc kmod-mt76 dnsmasq iptables ip6tables ppp ppp-mod-pppoe firewall odhcpd odhcp6c<br />Available Profiles:</p><p>Default:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Default Profile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Packages: kmod-usb-core kmod-usb2 kmod-usb-ohci kmod-ledtrig-usbdev</p><p>so I generate image with command</p><p>$ make image PROFILE=Default PACKAGES=&quot;base-files busybox collectd other-packages-names bla bla bla&quot; FILES=files/</p><p>but the same error appears again:<br />WARNING: Image file /home/labasky/openwrt_img_generator/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-ramips-mt7620.Linux-x86_64/build_dir/target-mipsel_24kec+dsp_musl-1.1.15/linux-ramips_mt7620/tmp/openwrt-ramips-mt7620-ex2700-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin is too big</p><p>then image generation process failed,<br />I guess the main reason of failure is Netgear EX2700 only has 4MB size of flash capacity,<br />I selected too many packages , and that cause generated image larger than 4MB,<br />so image generation process stopped, cannot go any futher<br />so this is my last question,<br />May I generate image file with Image Builder only for Lenovo y1s ? (I want to skip image build process of ex2700)<br />I don&#039;t know how to specify PROFILE parameter for y1s<br />because when I run &#039;make info&#039; <br />the only Profile name I can get is &#039;Default&#039;<br />thank you for your kindly help.</p>									</div>

					<p>The same problem. By default the target is ALL platforms. The list of TARGET_DEVICES one can found in openwrt/target/linux/ramips/image/*.mk files. I successfully specified this parameter in ordinary build. But in the ImageBuilder you can&#039;t specify it in command line?</p>									</div>
