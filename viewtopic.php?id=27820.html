					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve installed trunk on my WNDR3700.<br />it&#039;s pretty minimalistic build: base + luci + qos + upnp + ath9k + ddns<br />when connected on 2.4Ghz (g+n, 40 Mhz, 5 + 1, wpa2) I can see very unstable ping from my laptop with intel 4965agn card.<br />before I remember seeing vast majority of latencies &lt;1ms.<br />now they&#039;re regularly around 3-10ms with spikes (at least once a minute) to 100+ms.<br />some packets also get lost. small percentage though, like 0.1%</p><p>I have confirmed that it&#039;s not problem with 4965, because in same time I can see spikes/dropped packets on laptop I see lags or even disconnection from game server on xbox 360s, which is connected via wifi too.</p><p>I tried disabling all that I can safely disable: qos, miniupnpd, firewall, usb, cron.<br />it doesn&#039;t change anything though.</p><p>one thing I&#039;ve checked is file /sys/kernel/debug....ath9k/recv has quickly running up number in UNDERRUN field, and 10x smaller number of CRC errors.</p><p>I wonder if it&#039;s known problem and I&#039;m missing something or I should go ahead and open bug on it.</p><br /><p>thanks.<br />Andrey</p>									</div>
