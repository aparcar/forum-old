					<p>Due to the current supply issues with the WRT54GL and their high prices, I have sourced a router from China that has a 1W transmit power, 4 LAN ports, 8MB Flash and 16MB Ram.</p><p>Landed in the US they should cost around $30 each</p><p>However, they use a Realtek chipset: RTL8186, RTL8225 not the Broadcom or Atheros that we normally see.</p><p>Is it possible to port OpenWRT to this chipset and who could do the work. I&#039;m willing to fund it and supply test units but need to know if it&#039;s possible.</p><p>Thanks for any input</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>
