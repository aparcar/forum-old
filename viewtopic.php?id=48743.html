					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up my router as a PPTP client to connect to a PPTP server. I&#039;d then like to route traffic from a single IP on my LAN to route traffic through the tunnel.</p><p>I&#039;ve been following <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.client.pptp">this</a> guide but a combination of inexperience on my part and the guide being a little out or date has resulted in my getting stuck.</p><p>Here&#039;s where I&#039;m at:</p><p>1. SSH in to router and:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg install ppp-mod-pptp
opkg install luci-proto-ppp</code></pre></div><p>Then using LuCI / Network / Interfaces / &#039;Add new interface...&#039; I&#039;ve created a new interface called VPN01</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://take.ms/Jb1ca" alt="http://take.ms/Jb1ca" /></span></p><p>I then setup my PPTP creds (I&#039;m connection to GigaNews PPTP server)</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://take.ms/I2YoR" alt="http://take.ms/I2YoR" /></span></p><p>At this point the guides says &quot;Now Create / Assign the firewall zone&quot; but I really don&#039;t know what that means?</p><p>I think it&#039;s referring to this page but which zone should I choose?</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://take.ms/YVxXD" alt="http://take.ms/YVxXD" /></span></p><p>For now I&#039;ll choose &#039;wan&#039;. This changes the Interface page to look like this:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://take.ms/hEdNx" alt="http://take.ms/hEdNx" /></span></p><p>When I click on &#039;Connect&#039; nothing appears to happen. Is there a PPTP log I can check to see if it&#039;s connecting / failing?</p><p>Another problem is that there is nowhere within the PPTP setting to add advanced options, in the case of Giganews I think I need to add: &quot;mppe required,no40,no56,stateless&quot; somewhere.</p><p>Any help to get my to the next stage is much appreciated.</p><p>Dan<br />--<br />TP-Link TL-WR2543N/ND v1<br />OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TeaPot</strong> on 1 Feb 2014, 11:47)</p>

					<p>I can&#039;t get it to connect with the VPN Client on a WR841ND v8.2 I can ping the pptp vpn server from the router and trace route to it but it will not connect the VPN.</p><p>Any computer upstream on any lan or wifi interface can connect via vpn to the same address just the router can&#039;t.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://britishexpats.com/photopost/data/500/medium/Screen_Shot_2014-02-12_at_23_02_02.png" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>I can&#039;t get rid of the Adsl modem as it has a voip phone connected to it and no other model is supported and it does not support openwrt and the reason for the second subnet is all traffic from the 192.168.2.1 router goes via a smartdns service.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaora</strong> on 13 Feb 2014, 00:09)</p>
