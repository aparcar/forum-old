					<p>Hi all, I&#039;m new here and I was hoping that you could help me with a little problem I had playing with my router:</p><p>The problem was that I made an script with a S=50, copied it to the init.d directory and enable it from the gui startup interface so it can runs always in every boot. The problem now is that when I restart the router it seems to not work well because I can&#039;t connect with it (not with telnet neither with ssh). I supose that my script is broken.</p><p>But now, I try to delete my script from the init.d directory (with the failsafe mode), but when I open the init.d directory, i can&#039;t find none of my scripts, ony are the default ones.</p><p>So, the question is, how can I delete my script from the router in failsafe mode or maybe, edit some startup conf file to delete the line that executes my script.</p><p>Any tip will be helpful.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, finally I could solve the problem with the &gt;mount_root command, accesing the init.d directory and deleting my script.</p>									</div>
