					<p>Yesterday I flashed a brand new WRT3200ACM with openwrt-mvebu-linksys-wrt3200acm-squashfs-factory.img,<br />image build from&nbsp; git.openwrt.org/openwrt/staging/kaloz.git</p><p>Release 17.01.4 could NOT be installed -&gt; <br />&quot; Newer Linksys boards might come with a Winbond W29N02GV which can be<br />configured in different ways. Make sure we configure it the same way<br />as the older chips so everything keeps working.&quot;<br />(commit 7ae59a2f288ba1cef23b20e1d36e199e8c646245).</p><p>I have everything working (luci, Amazing job!, really impressive!) I am very happy... BUT...<br />I am now in the middle of nowhere in term in release<br />(OpenWrt SNAPSHOT r6153-7ae59a2, Kernel 4.9.77) and I can&#039;t upgrade/install kmod module<br />as the current snapshot in kernel is 4.14.29. I am a little bit reluctant to put device in production.</p><p>So I played with idea to reinstall everything from current snapshot...<br />but the 6 week ago Imre Kaloz commit have not been merged within &quot;LEDE Source Repository&quot;</p><p>Questions:<br />Is there a time frame to merge all(?) staging contributions to main project?<br />Where I could find release-support policy/procedure description?<br />It is my understanding 2 teams (openwrt and LEDE) merged together and this policy is not yet well defined,<br />Am I wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot, noticed&nbsp; Imre Kaloz (and others) commit merged 10 hours ago.</p><p>It is not &quot;crystal clear&quot; in my mind how the team is proceeding about versions and updates.</p><p>My way would be:<br />&quot;release&quot; which are never changed once tagged/committed.</p><p>&quot;snapshot&quot; which keep the same kernel as current release and include<br />armless adjustments (as the WRT3200ACM new hardware fix)<br />and packages bug fix (no need to do a sysupgrade to have firmware last small bug fix)</p><p>&quot;devel&quot;, keep track of the last current kernel and fully open for experimentation<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The way &quot;snapshot&quot; is done (keeping kernel up to date in real time) doesn&#039;t<br />help to keep devices in production mode. Having &quot;okpg install/upgrade usable<br />within snapshot series does.</p><p>My 2 cents.</p><p>Tried to compile openwrt.git yesterday (on Centos 6 x64 dev platform) was not successful<br />(a components with a compilation error), I&#039;ll try again tonight with the current git.</p><p>Thanks again for the merge.</p>									</div>
