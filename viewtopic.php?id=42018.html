					<p>I have a project&nbsp; where I will need a decent number (100+) of Openwrt boxes that will run in various locations linked to a bespoke sensor board that has a serial connection. I&#039;m thus looking for the cheapest device that runs Openwrt and has a &#039;real&#039; serial header - ie one with pins. For this project I dont mind cracking open plastic cases, but I cant risk soldering onto little pads or direct onto chips.</p><p>Candidates so far - TP-Link 3020<br />Ubiquiti Airrouter</p><p>Both have headers on pins, and cost Â£20 / $30 including sales tax in UK.</p><p>Any others I might have missed? Some of the TP-Link stuff is cheaper (and comes in a more hackable case) , but doesnt have pin headers. I dont actually need wirless either.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
