					<p>I have a TP-LINK WR740 with OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 working as WDS-Station with two WiFi networks, one to connect to the WDS AP, attached to WAN interface, and another as to serve wireless hosts, attached to LAN interface.</p><p>The WAN interface has a DHCP client configuration.<br />The LAN interface a static address, 192.168.3.1 without any specific gateway or DNS server.</p><p>I have problems resolving DNS queries.</p><p>Sometimes it doesn&#039;t resolve queries, so I have to reload a page several times until it enter to a site. <br />In [Diagnostics] page of OpenWrt when I ping an address like &quot;openwrt.org&quot; sometimes I get <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ping: bad address &#039;openwrt.org&#039;</code></pre></div><p>or<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nslookup: can&#039;t resolve &#039;openwrt.org&#039;: Name or service not known</code></pre></div><p> but then (a few seconds later) I try again and it works.</p><p>I have tried to configure DNS server (a local DNS, 192.168.100.1 and 8.8.8.8) into LAN interface definition without results.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to debug the problem. So far I understand, in this setup it is not necessary to manually configure any DNS server because the DHCP client running on WAN interface writes file <strong>/tmp/resolv.conf.auto</strong> every time it connects to my local DHCP server, and dnsmasq read that file (in <strong>/etc/config/dhcp</strong> that file it&#039;s on &quot;option resolvfile&quot; setting).</p><p>My question is, why when I do a nslookup from [Diagnostics] page on Luci or with ssh I get <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Server:    127.0.0.1
Address 1: 127.0.0.1 localhost</code></pre></div><p>If in <strong>/tmp/resolv.conf.auto</strong> it&#039;s says <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Interface wan
nameserver 192.168.100.1</code></pre></div><p>It shouldn&#039;t says &quot;Server: 192.168.100.1&quot; (my local DNS server)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tonyn</strong> on 21 Apr 2015, 17:46)</p>

					<p>No. The OS DNS lookup will use dnsmasq listening on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) which in turn will ask 192.168.100.1<br />This is done this way so that OpenWrt itself has the same view on DNS as the attached DHCP clients do.</p><p>I suggest checking &quot;logread&quot; for dnsmasq-related errors.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK thanks, that is exactly what I&#039;m trying to do, test DNS configuration as the router were a host client.</p><p>What makes things interesting it&#039;s that I have another router (exactly the same hardware and OpenWRT version) working well, so it&#039;s a puzzle why this one doesn&#039;t work properly. I even copied configuration from one router to this one without results.</p><p>I will keep testing.</p>									</div>
