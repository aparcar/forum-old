					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I have some issue with TFTP recovery regarding the mentioned router. I flashed the latest 15.05.1 self-compiled image on it and it works fine. As I will mess around with the router I wanted to ensure that TFTP is working. For some reason though, I can not enter TFTP recovery. If I follow the procedure mentioned on the wiki, I end up in the OpenWRT failsafe mode. I have an older version (old flash chip) of the router to compare it with and there it works fine with the same image. I also read about other people using TFTP with the new version of the router.</p><p>I was wondering if anybody experienced the same issues and may have a solution? I would appreciate having TFTP recovery as a last option. </p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>Kind regards<br />Kacha</p>									</div>
