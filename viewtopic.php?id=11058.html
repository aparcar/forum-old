					<p>Hey, all the features you want have standard packages for OpenWRT...</p><p>Asterisk - well that&#039;s a complex application, if you&#039;re asking for it you probably know how to configure it, otherwise some good info here and on the web...<br />IPSEC - Ports for OpenSwan and kernel modules to be a client and server...<br />DynDNS - X-WRT (<a href="http://www.x-wrt.org">http://www.x-wrt.org</a>)&#039;s webif^2 interface lets you configure this (once you&#039;ve installed ez-ipupdate, it&#039;s a link so easy to install)...<br />Qos - Again, X-WRT supports this out the box (once you&#039;ve installed qos-scripts, same installation ease)...</p><p>All the packages installations are fairly simply done, either by command line or from the web interface. Suggest looking into X-WRT for a good set of management tools over and above what you&#039;ve asked about...</p><p>Hey hey!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
