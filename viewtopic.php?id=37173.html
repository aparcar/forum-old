					<p>On 05/20/2012, I have submitted for a ticket (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11505">#11505</a>) requesting to include a gspca_se401 driver support into the OpenWRT Linux kernel. Can any OpenWRT developers who is in charge in the kernel kindly take a look at the ticket (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11505">#11505</a>) and apply the included patch? This way, webcam devices based on an SE401 chipset can be used on an OpenWRT based device.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
