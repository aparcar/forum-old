					<p>I&#039;ve bricked my TP-Link TL-WR741nd and I&#039;ve bought the PL2303 USB to RS232 adapter.</p><p>I have soldered on 3 wires to the motherboard, RX, TX and GND as it showed on the Wiki diagram. This is a v2.4 board. Anyways, the solders are not the cleanest ones but they *should* work. </p><p>However, when I plug in the adapter and open putty with the correct bit rate, I get a blank screen. I&#039;ve checked if by any chance I&#039;ve switched wires but all of them go from TX to TX, RX to RX and GND to GND.</p><p>I don&#039;t know what else to try.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>UPDATE: Here are a few images to show what I did...</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JG3dW1X.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/JG3dW1X.jpg" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lvLDKrM.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/lvLDKrM.jpg" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2Y36FZZ.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/2Y36FZZ.jpg" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>suchpro</strong> on 16 Jul 2016, 18:31)</p>

					<p>No clue as to <strong>error code 10</strong> would be but naturally is the correct COM port set as the <em>PuTTY</em> session <em>Serial line</em> value.</p>									</div>
