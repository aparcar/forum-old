					<p>Here is the issue. I am running Kamikaze 7.09 (2.4 kernel) on WRT54G (v4) with the&quot;cifs&quot; module.</p><p> I go to win2k3, and setup a share there, but keep the &quot;File and Printer sharing for MS Networks&quot; disabled.</p><p> I try to mount on WRT54G, command similar to:<br />mount -t cifs //my-pc/share /mnt/point -o unc=\\\\my-pc\\share,ip=192.168.1.100,user=john,pass=doe</p><p> And the mount hangs (Ctrl-C to exit).</p><p> I go enable &quot;File and Printer sharing for MS Networks&quot;, try again. It hangs again (Ctrl-C to exit).</p><p> I go to Microsoft firewall (it is &quot;on&quot;), and enable exceptions for &quot;File and Printer sharing&quot;.</p><p> Now I try to mount, and it succeeds! If I do &quot;umount&quot; and &quot;mount&quot; again, it succeeds again.</p><p> I reboot the router, and try the mount. It goes through, but does not mount anything.</p><p> I disable &quot;File and Printer sharing for MS Networks&quot;&nbsp; and remove firewall exceptions for &quot;File and Printer sharing&quot;, reboot the router, and try the mount. It goes through quickly and does not mount anything.</p><p> Only after I reboot Windows 2003, and keep &quot;File and Printer sharing for MS Networks&quot; off, then if I try to mount on WRT, it hangs (good sign!). Then I enable &quot;File and Printer sharing for MS Networks&quot; and make a firewall exception again, and it works.</p><p> So there seem to be some tricky interplay between WRT and Windows file sharing going on ...</p>									</div>

					<p>Here is an update. It looks like the issue is most likely some weird bug/feature in Windows 2003.</p><p> The solution is a bit kludgy, yet takes only 1 click after the setup. Basically, the idea is to &quot;reboot&quot; the network card, then I can properly mount Windows share on the router again.</p><p> Download &quot;devcon&quot; from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311272">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311272</a></p><p> Copy &quot;devcon.exe&quot; to C:\windows\system32, or wherever your windows is.</p><p> Open a DOS window and run &quot;devcon find pci*&quot;</p><p> In devices, find your network card, such as this line for my computer :<br />PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_170C&amp;SUBSYS_018D1028&amp;REV_02\4&amp;16793A72&amp;0&amp;28F0: Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller</p><p> On desktop, create a file &quot;net_reset.cmd&quot;, and put the following commands in there:<br />###<br />@echo off<br />echo Disabling the network adapter...................<br />devcon disable &quot;PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_170C&amp;SUBSYS_018D1028&quot;<br />echo Done................<br />echo Enabling the network adapter ...............<br />devcon enable &quot;PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_170C&amp;SUBSYS_018D1028&quot;<br />echo Done................<br />### </p><p> Note that the device line is the one you determined for your device, in my case it was &quot;PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_170C&amp;SUBSYS_018D1028&quot;, but yours will be different.</p><p> Anytime windows share is flaky, just reboot the network card, and it will work again!</p>									</div>
