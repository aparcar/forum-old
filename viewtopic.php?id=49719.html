					<p>Hi I have this board that originally came with only 2 Mb flash spi and 8 MB ram + vxworks<br />I soldered 16 MB ram and have tried 4Mb and 8Mb spi flash with redboot .<br />I can see in serial console that redboot boots fine but the board immediately&nbsp; reboots.<br />I have tried many redboot versions from dd-wrt ap51 ap61 and all of them do the same thing.<br />I have worked with many routers installing openwrt on them but never had anything like this.</p><p>my board is exactly as the one on this pic.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10855">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10855</a> </p><p>I know this is an old board, It would be easy to just get a new one but I hate to throw away perfectly good hardware specially AR-2316 based.</p><p>I would appreciate any help I can get installing openwrt on this <br />regards</p>									</div>
