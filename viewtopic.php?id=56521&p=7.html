					<p>I think the support status should stay compact, but instead of showing the earliest supported version, <strong>just keep it at the most recent version that fully supports the device</strong>. That might be easiest - it removes the need for listing multiple versions, and it eliminates the problems the &#039;earliest supported version&#039; practice we use now creates, which doesn&#039;t imply whether newer versions still (fully) support it. While I like to know how far back support dates for a historical device, that can always be listed on the device page itself.</p><p>Do agree on not using SVN revisions as well. Most people won&#039;t want to build OpenWrt first time they want to try it. People who do usually know what they are doing and whether their device is supported or not.</p><p>E.g. The WRT54GL could then list 12.09, and others 14.07, ...

Right now I think if we run it for 2 weeks we can hopefully get a few hundred answers, and that would be very valuable, for now.

If your device is supported by OpenWrt version X, but is not maintained (at least receiving security patches), how &#039;supported&#039; is your device, really?

					<p>About the survey...</p><p>We need to know what to do with device versions. Often it is critical to get the right information here. V2 may be fine and V3 does not work at all. Sometimes several versions are listed on the same line in TOH, sometimes on different lines. I would like to produce a survey where all versions (same line or not) show up in a list, together with &quot;Don&#039;t Know&quot; (after the user selected Brand/Device). On the other hand, I have a WDR4900. It is either 1.0 or 1.3 (I don&#039;t know), but I know it is NOT 2.0.<br/>If, on the other hand, there are no relevant/known different versions, we might not want to annoy the user with it. This requires some thinking.</p><p>It would simplify the Form a lot if the first page was: Fill out Brand, Model, Version, and we asked the user to consult the ToH (or another purpose-generated list) to find the information. Or even just a (row/model)number. On the other hand, if I build the form myself in the same technology that my single hardware list is build in this is not an issue at all. Then we just need to figure out how to gather that answers.</p>									</div>
