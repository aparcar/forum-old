					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to use a Netgear N900 (WNDA4100) USB WiFi dongle to provide my Huawei HG556A router with 5GHz WiFi. The router is running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer.</p><p>I chose this dongle because it was mentioned in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48248">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48248</a> as working.</p><p>Under Windows, the dongle was tested to work correctly for connecting to an access point.</p><p>Sadly I was not able to make this dongle work under OpenWrt. I tried both the OpenWrt-provided package (kmod-rt2800-usb) and the Ralink provided module (rt3573sta) without success.</p><p>Using the module from kmod-rt2800-usb, the dongle was detected without problems and I was able to configure an access point (and no errors could be found in the logs when enabled). For some reason, that access point was not detected by any PC or smartphone. Besides, I tried using the WiFi Analizer app in my smartphone but no transmissions were detected in the channel set on the access point configuration (the behavior was the same independently of the band used.. 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz).</p><p>Trying to set the dongle to client mode I could scan for access points but I would not be able to connect to one I tried, reporting authentication timeouts in the logs. This access point works correctly with other clients.</p><p>In both cases, the LED in the dongle would flash purple when it was enabled.</p><p>Using the Ralink-provided module (compiled from source code), when the module was loaded, ifconfig would show the &quot;ra0&quot; device with an all-zero MAC address. When issuing a &quot;ifconfig ra0 up&quot; command, a few warnings show up in the OpenWrt log and the router reboots, but at least the dongle&#039;s LED is orange, the same color as when using Windows. These warnings could be due to some changes in the code that I had to make in order for it to compile without errors.</p><p>In any case, I would be interested in using the OpenWrt-provided drivers since I would like to set up an access point with this dongle. As I&#039;ve read, this is not possible using the Ralink module.</p><p>I would appreciate any help for making this dongle work correctly with my router.</p><p>Related to this... is there a list of WiFi dongles tested to work correctly with OpenWrt?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ronaldace</strong> on 4 Jan 2016, 18:30)</p>
