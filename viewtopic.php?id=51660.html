					<p>In the past few days <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/14/07/15/155201/openwrt-1407-rc1-supports-native-ipv6-procd-init-system">a lot</a> of <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTc0MTc">websites</a> have <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/OpenWrt-14-07-RC1-quot-Barrier-Breaker-quot-Gets-IPv6-Native-Support-and-Sysupgrade-on-NAND-flash-450761.shtml">relaunched</a> the piece of news about the RC1 for the Barrier Breaker version of our beloved linux distribution.<br />Since then, inface, you can see that <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/">14.07RC1</a> is available for a rather large number of hw platforms.<br />Were you able to read anything official here in this announcement forum or even in the OpenWRT.org website itself?<br />I bet for a general &quot;no, we weren&#039;t&quot;. That&#039;s because there is no news at all there.<br />I am not moaning (again!) about the website sporting &quot;Backfire 10.03.1-rc5&quot; as the latest headlines.<br />I feel quite embarassed by the fact that there is no mention about this wonderful and very latest piece of news.<br />I volunteer for managing the website. Who is in charge at the moment?<br />Is there a way to stop this nonsense, like linking kamikaze documentation for 12.09 release (in the main page)?</p>									</div>
