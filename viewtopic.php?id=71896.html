					<p>So, long story short, need to get USB wifi dongle (8812au based Edimax AC600) working as separate interface with MR3020 that has latest openwrt installed.</p><p>I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT on MR3020</p><p>but when I connect the 8812au dongle to the USB port nothing happens.</p><p>The logs say USB device found and &quot;that&#039;s it&quot;</p><p>Need help on further steps.</p><p>I suspect it doesn&#039;t have 8812au driver (most linuxes don&#039;t, I had to compile one for my Ubuntu laptop when I used the dongle with it)</p><p>How do I go about it on openWRT?<br />Maybe there&#039;s a package with drivers with dongles like this?</p><p>Please help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>P.S.:<br />Usecase is wifi bridging while taking advantage of AC600&#039;s rather beefy directional antenna</p>									</div>
