					<p>Why is it you think that your DHCP lease isn&#039;t renewed? You do realize that more often than not you will receive the same IP address every time your router renews the lease?</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s the whole point. Renewing your DHCP lease (usually) does not give you a new WAN IP. </p><p>How to override this depends on who is giving you the IP in the first place. Perhaps you should contact them.</p>									</div>
