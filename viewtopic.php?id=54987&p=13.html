I read a lot of comments that the version provided here should be unstable, but all other &quot;stable&quot; versions appear to be in Chinese only.</p><p>By the way, I wasn&#039;t to boot the alternative bootloader Breed as well, because the u-boot mtd is locked. jffs2reset didn&#039;t help.

					<p>Hey,</p><p>Greetings from Finland. I&#039;ve been following this topic and I wanted <br />to share my experiences with the Xiaomi Wifi Mini router.</p><p>I got this little white box couple months ago and first installed stable release of Chaos Calmer. Btw, during the installation I skipped the android-app-ssh-part and just used telnet connection to do &#039;mtd write&#039; for the new firmware (Openwrt firmware was on the mounted usb-stick)..the main Wiki Page should be updated, installation is much simpler that way..</p><p>On software side, everything was working pretty stable with OpenWrt CC, but noticed as well that the 2.4Ghz signal was weak. What I have read here, that seems to be an typical issue without the non-proprietary wifi-module source codes..</p><p>Next, I decided to try out some other firmware instead (with the better wifi support)..First I replaced stock u-boot with breed-mt7620-xiaomi-mini.bin (read about that from this topic, thanks for the tip!). Did a check -&gt; cat /proc/mtd and I installed breed over the u-boot partition, and it worked..Breed is really cool tool to install new firmware and a good safety measure as well.&nbsp; </p><p>Downloaded Breed for Xiaomi Wifi Mini:</p><p><a href="https://routerclub.ru/upload/upload/breed/r791%20%5B2015-11-03%5D/breed-mt7620-xiaomi-mini.bin/">https://routerclub.ru/upload/upload/bre … -mini.bin/</a></p><p>Then I did some research and founded that the same SoC (Mediatek 7260A), the mainboard of this Xiaomi box, is used by various other manufactures on many different commercial routers too (like Asus, Buffalo, Lenovo routers, etc.)..I&#039;m little bit of fan of Asus and decided to install Asus firmware on my box. Then I looked for a Asus&nbsp; device with similar SoC, Memory and the flash size. And I founded a virtual couple for my Xiaomi box: ASUS RT-AC54U. </p><p><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_RT-AC54U/">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_RT-AC54U/</a></p><p>My (another) Frankenstein-dream was about to come true: <br />Xiaomi &amp; &lt;3 Asus :-) </p><p>..Furthermore founded out that there&#039;s russian hacker called Andy Padavan,&nbsp; who is modifying and developing 3rd party firmware for ASUS devices, pushing the Asus devices to do more tricks than the stock firmware..Checked that he has been&nbsp; developing firmwares for a long time (no backdoors founded from those firmwares so far), so it seemed forth to try out one of his creations. So my final firmware choice was &#039;RT-AC54U_3.4.3.9-099_base.trx&#039; firmware which I downloaded from: </p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u/downloads/">https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u/downloads/</a></p><p>..I used Breed to install that firmware and it worked!</p><p>Now my Xiaomi Wifi Mini box is running latest RT-AC54U 3.4.3.9-00 firmware: GUI-config is nice and working great, firmware is stable and fast..And the Wifi 2.4Ghz&nbsp; signal is really strong (compared to OpenWrt CC)..Furthermore the USB port is working, LAN ports are working..Only flaw that I have founded so far is that only 64Mt memory is used (I wonder why the rest of RAM isn&#039;t allocated..)..I only use 2,4Ghz, so I have no experience about the 5Gghz Wifi. Also there&#039;s a possibility to install extra software to USB-ext-formated device (entware pkgs)</p><p><a href="http://entware.wl500g.info/binaries/entware/Packages.html">http://entware.wl500g.info/binaries/ent … kages.html</a></p><p>So If you&#039;re interested, you should try out this&nbsp; firmware too..I&#039;m pretty happy with it so far. Btw, Writing this post with my Acer Hackinstosh computer, which is running the latest El Capitan with all updates ;-)</p><br /><br /><p>Cheers,</p><p>Yogibear</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yogibear</strong> on 17 Mar 2016, 06:06)</p>

					<p>Yogibear,</p><p>Padavan has an image for the Xiaomi Mini at <a href="https://routerclub.ru/upload/padavan/nightly/20160317/xrm_base/MI-MINI_3.4.3.9-099.trx">https://routerclub.ru/upload/padavan/ni … .9-099.trx</a> that might allow you to use all the DRAM.</p><p>By the way, which Acer model did you convert to a Hackintosh?</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, Padavan has even created specific firmware for this Xiaomi router, that&#039;s very nice :-)</p><p>I&#039;ll definitely try out that firmware, thanks for the tip.</p><p>My Acer is Veriton M680G. I reckon, it&#039;s a good base for hackintosh project, the mainboard is pretty much all Intel based chips (close enough to older mac pro). Newer iMacs are all built from small laptop parts (too thin designs to fit proper GPU&#039;s etc parts anymore..And that new Mac Pro is ridicously expensive and no proper GPU either..So I&#039;m pretty happy with my iAcer with Intel i7 4-core CPU,12Gt of RAM, 3 hard drivers and a proper GPU (Nvidia GTX-750)..</p><p>//Yogibear</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yogibear</strong> on 17 Mar 2016, 06:56)</p>

					<p>Unmesh: Maybe you can open ssh / telnet on your Xiaomi Nano, then from the console try out the command:<br /># mtd_write </p><p>that tool should be included with the Padavan firmware, use it to flash the whole firmware or just replace the u-boot partition.</p><p>I have discovered there&#039;s some bugs in Breed, the process bar could get stuck (but it still flashes, just wait).</p><p>..and for (Breed) firmware update you have to make selections something like this:</p><p> <span class="postimg"><img src="http://i64.tinypic.com/16025qq.jpg" alt="http://i64.tinypic.com/16025qq.jpg" /></span></p><p>It would be nice to know what that last setting is 0x50000, mtd partitions size ? (I have left that setting alone)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yogibear</strong> on 17 Mar 2016, 07:51)</p>

					<p>The last setting is the offset for the partition that you want to load from and only applies to the EEPROM menu choice.</p><p>The radio button at the bottom is to do an automatic reboot on completion of the flash operation.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks guys for sharing. I gave Padawan (installed with Breed) and DD a try.</p><p>Padawan is pretty fast and 2,4 GHz as well as 5 GHz WiFi works on my Mi WiFi, but the AP isolation mode for the Guest WiFi seems to be broken. Both available settings restrict access to the AP itself only, access to all other IPs of the subnet is still allowed. And there is no option for providing DHCP to the Guest WiFis only (in WiFi AP mode). In summary this is the best firmware (besides stock) I tried so far, but it doesn&#039;t provide the functionalities I need (yes, there seems to be opkg as well). Also, I don&#039;t know if I can trust this Russian RouterClub thing - the Chinese stock firmware was no option to me, because of data security - why trust an unknown Russian custom firmware? I&#039;d still prefer OpenWrt.</p><p>That&#039;s why I installed OpenWrt latest trunk snapshot (DD) and gave it another try. Unfortunately I wasn&#039;t able to access the device after applying all changes I made through LuCi (had to install it via SSH first). Having Breed as a replacement for u-boot helped a lot in this case. So I guess I&#039;ll put my WiFi Mini back in my desk drawer and wait for OpenWrt stable. Thanks for your help!</p><p>In case anyone needs it: The default username and password for Padawan is &quot;admin&quot;. You can administrate it via Telnet. SSH needs to be activated first.</p>									</div>
