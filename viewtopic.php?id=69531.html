					<p>I am interested in trying some of the features of the latest strongSwan such as the New Hope Post-Quantum Key Exchange Algorithm (<a href="https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/NewHope">https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/st â€¦ ki/NewHope</a>).</p><p>The strongswan-full meta-package (5.5.1) does not appear to include newhope and some other options. Is strongswan-full intended to include all available plugins (except kernel-ipsec and socket-dynamic)?</p><p>I am still learning my way around the build system and apologise if I have misunderstood some aspects of it. There is an &quot;@DEVEL&quot; at the end of the &quot;DEPENDS&quot; list in feeds/packages/net/strongswan/Makefile which might provide a mechanism for including additional plugins.</p><p>If I need to produce a modified package to include more plugins can anyone recommend a good guide to the process?</p>									</div>
