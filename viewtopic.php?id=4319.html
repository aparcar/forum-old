					<p>My little blurb there was by no means intended to be an exhaustive list!&nbsp; :-)</p><p>I&#039;ve looked at the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">Table of Hardware</a> and I&#039;m impressed at the variety of devices OpenWRT runs on!<br />And I&#039;m really glad those nice tables and details are out there.</p><p>But I&#039;m figuring that there are only a handful of devices that stand out and, for those of us in the market, it&#039;d be nice to have a short list of winners.</p><p>It&#039;s looking to me so far like the Linksys WRT54GS and the ASUS WL500GD are the way to go.<br />I&#039;ll probably go w/ the Linksys just b/c of th user base, if I can find the right hardware revision.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah well I wasn&#039;t trying to be persnickety, but we all have our targetted needs. I really like this SL unit but the radio part of it&#039;s 3 main feature is by far the weak-point.</p><p>For my other project, the community WISP, I would love to have a unit:<br />1) Compact, like the WRT54GC unit<br />2) Low power demands<br />3) Flexible voltage like the WRT54G/GS, can run homebuilt PoE through 80-feet of Cat5 w factory wart.<br />4) Single antenna port is fine<br />5) Enough memory like old units to cram in different features on same hardware.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This unit loaded with packages for client, this one for backhaul, etc. But same hardware.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I can live with 4/16 and do, but I&#039;m greedy would like to have 8/32.<br />6) Linux-friendly bootloader<br />7) serial and JTAG ports already wired<br />8) REAL on-board clock with battery.</p><p>It really is going to be hard to replace the old G/GS/GL units for me. It still seems very odd to me that all my other computer hardware gets cheaper and/or more features. The PC of 3 years ago for $1,000, would have a great amount more RAM, CPU, and storage now, for same $1,000. Or in a more direct example 3 years ago $50 would have bought what about a 128M or maybe 256M on-sale flash drive. Now a 1-gig flash $50 no problem.</p><p>However, the WRT54GS v5 with it&#039;s meager 2 megs of flash costs the same as the original GS v1.0.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" />&nbsp; WTF?</p><p>Forgive my rant.....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 4 Feb 2006, 01:49)</p>
