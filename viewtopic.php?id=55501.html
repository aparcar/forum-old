					<p>Hello,<br />I am running a total of four wireless networks on my WNDR3700 - BARRIER BREAKER (14.07, r42625), two of them using enterprise authentication against a local freeradius2 server. One of the two is a restricted network with firewall and proxy, the other is unrestricted. As Android devices cannot automatically configure a proxy, I am sticking with two distinct SSIDs rather than a dynamic VLAN configuration. In the users file I am restricting the authorized networks per user/device via NAS-Port == 1/2 as necessary.<br />I would also like to do authentication on parts of my wired network. It looks like if I add a managed switch that supports radius, then this should work, reusing the same radius server and returning the attributes Tunnel-Type=VLAN, Tunnel-Medium-Type=802, and <br />Tunnel-Private-Group-ID . However I have not seen any hint on how to manage the embedded switch of my WNDR3700 to do that. My understanding is that I may have to run an additional hostapd on wired, but I didnÂ´t get this to work. Also it&nbsp; is unclear how I would then connect the vlan to one of the two existing bridges. <br />Anyone doing authentication on wired network? Willing to share the setup? <br />Thanks, jol</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not aware of any way to do 802.1x authentication on wired switch ports currently with OpenWRT. I don&#039;t think it would be impossible (though maybe it is, I haven&#039;t dug into it enough on the development side to know) but I think it would involve a substantial increase in the complexity in the way the switch is managed though OpenWRT. I would call OpenWRT switches &quot;semi-managed&quot; in that you can create vlans and tagged (trunk) ports but that&#039;s about it. None of the other features of true enterprise managed switches are there. Some features could undoubtedly be added through a major rewrite of the OpenWRT switch management routines but others may require changes to the switch hardware chip itself which would present a problem.</p>									</div>
