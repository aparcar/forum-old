					<p>For those who struggle with the TFTP download...<br />I&#039;ve tried using 2 directly connected laptops and transfer through a hub, configured fixed speed&amp;duplex settings on the laptop&#039;s Ethernet port, tried tftpd-hpa, tftpd32 and the simple command line server included with the xmas release (thanks @yoq). The same failures were seen when using the recovery procedure and manually running the bootloader&#039;s tftpboot command. Nothing has helped so far with the dreaded &quot;Same block again; ignore it&quot; errors, timeouts and eventual failure.</p><p>Does anybody have a statically linked flashing tool that could be uploaded and run under the TP-LINK stock firmware to do flashing or is there any other method to do it from there? </p><p>The method that worked for me so far requires serial dongle and using the bootloader &quot;loadb&quot; command to transfer the firmware. Here&#039;s what it takes. The TP-LINK is the US version. Before starting upgrade install the latest stock firmware (currently Archer_C2(US)_V1_170228.zip). This stock firmware contains the same bootloader as the yoq&#039;s xmas release (post #124).</p><p>Run &quot;kermit&quot; (&quot;sudo apt-get install ckermit&quot; if need to install it under Ubuntu) and then (assuming your serial connection to the router is through ttyUSB0)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>SET MODEM TYPE DIRECT
SET PORT /dev/ttyUSB0
SET SPEED 115200
SET CARRIER-WATCH OFF
SET FLOW NONE
SET PARITY NONE
SET CONTROL PREFIX ALL
connect</code></pre></div><p>Reboot the router and quickly click &#039;4&#039; to drop into the botloader prompt.<br />When in the bootloader prompt run &#039;loadb 0x82000000&#039; command, then click &#039;Ctrl+/&#039; and &#039;c&#039; to get back to kermit&#039;s command mode. In the kermit command mode issue the command to transfer yoq&#039;s OpenWRT firmware file<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>send /path-to/openwrt_r50020/ArcherC2V1_tp_recovery.bin</code></pre></div><p>It takes about 15min to transfer.
