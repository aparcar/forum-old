					<p>Yesterday I installed bearDropper because the &quot;authpriv.info dropbear&quot; entries on the syslog were starting to get annoying. <br />I don&#039;t worry much about someone actually succeeding on the attack since I use encrypted asymmetric keys for authentication for the SSH service, the same goes for OpenVPN and I don&#039;t have any other ports open to the internet.<br />I woke up and there were ~80 blocked entries on the bearDropper chain... the list keeps growing. </p><p>I mainly post this to raise awareness about these issues and to ask: Did this happen to you lately? How are you dealing with this? Thanks for reading.</p><p>I was going to post an image from the status/iptables page on LuCI but for some reason &quot;Too more links in message. Allowed 0 links. Reduce number of links and post it again.&quot;, nice spam policies...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, this has been quite common since some time ago... there are thousands and thousands of compromised devices out there, poking every IP address available, and trying to compromise more devices. Other than what you already did, I do not thing there is much else to be done.</p>									</div>
