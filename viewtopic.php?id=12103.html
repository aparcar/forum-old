					<p>I&#039;ve posted this as a bug report too but I&#039;m really hoping that other people may have experienced the same problem and at least offer moral support!</p><p>My WL 700ge will crash when put under heavy load copying files to/from the internal HD over a wireless connection.<br />This happens over samba and ftp (both optware). Kamikaze is installed to the HD.</p><p>I have been trying to figure out if I have a hardware/software problem:<br />- I&#039;ve taken the drive out and tested it for errors in Ubuntu. Nothing reported.<br />- Taken the drive out of the enclosure to reduce overall heat. No improvement.</p><p>From my testing, something seems to be going wrong between the IDE/wireless side of things. Transfers over a wired connection to/from the internal hd work perfectly. Also, I can&#039;t seem to crash the router by copying files from another computer on the lan over wireless.</p><p>This problem has been since I installed 7.06 right up to the current svn build (8414).</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions or commands/logs I run/check?</p><p>I&#039;ve been thinking one big help might be to get syslogd/logread to keep logs inbetween reboots. This seems possible as my fs is based on the hd but I can&#039;t quite understand how its done.</p>									</div>

					<p>*bump*</p><p>After more experimentation I have also discovered the crashing has nothing to do with optware packages I have installed. I wiped the HD of all OS files and reinstalled kamikaze with just the samba 2 client in the ipkg packages. When copying my mp3 collection to a client on the lan it crashed (again) after about 20 minutes of load.</p><p>Another thought was overheating although I am having the same problem with the HD sitting outside the enclosure where it is always cool(ish) to the touch.</p><p>Can anybody at least help on reading log files after a crash/reboot as they are stored in ram and lost <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Stereo,</p><p>I too suspected bad hardware and as a last resort reverted back to the original Asus firmware, although its the modified kfurge version. My router is as stable as a rock.

					<p>I might have the same problem...and some strange things happen:<br />if i do a ps<br />there are two, or more smbd processes after the crash but, the user nobody had started them.<br />and sometimes, the command reboot doesn&#039;t work, when samba crashed down. This is a little bit strange.</p>									</div>

					<p>On BackFire my Asus WL-500gp has the same problem. Router reboots on heavy load (torrent traffic). I had to move back on Oleg&#039;s firmware which works strong without crashes...</p>									</div>
