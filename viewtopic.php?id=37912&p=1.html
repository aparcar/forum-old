					<p>Hello, yesterday I got new WR720N and want to share some &quot;inside&quot; info <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/>, with hope that will be useful.</p><p>It&#039;s not as small as his bro - WR703 and MR11U. It has space for mounting external antenna and build-in battery or USB hub. <br/>It has build in Power supply + mini-USB for external power source ( like battery pack ) also has build in DC-DC converter - have&#039;t look at the chip spec but it looks like not only 5V but wide range voltage is available ( 3.6V to 9V?) still need to look and confirm what are the spec, manual does not say anything about battery specifications. </p><p>It has AR9331 it&#039;s basically the same as WR703 and MR11U, 4M flash + 32M RAM more significant is that it has two LAN/WAN ports + standard USB.<br/>It has acceptable coverage in 150sq.m concrete one level apartment building without modification.

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I flashed mine with the chineese modified firmware via standard web-interface ([antclan][20120825]720N-4M-USBTethering-MWAN2-NAS-3G-Printer). I assume that header was simply modified (703-&gt;720) and it fooled the device.</p><p>Later on, when openwrt was there, I flashed with 703 firmware via command line which worked with one NIC only.<br/>I flashed back to 720 version to have 2 NICs, however did not really have time to play around with it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gently</strong> on 17 Sep 2012, 12:40)</p>

A patch for a patch is less than ideal because line numbers changed and the patched patch does not apply. Getting this working is not very hard, but I didn&#039;t have time recently.</p>									</div>
