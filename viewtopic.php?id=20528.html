					<p>Actually 3 steps:</p><p>1. Go to /etc/init.d directory, open up a file named &quot;boot&quot; in vi editor, the last line of this file is &quot;load_modules /etc/modules.d/*&quot;, you need to put a line with text &quot;echo 0x9c &gt; /proc/diag/gpiomask&quot; above the load_modules line, save the file and exit vi, assuming you know how to use vi.</p><p>2. Go to /etc/modules.d directory, there are a whole bunch files in this directory, if you view the contents of any file, it only has a line or two with the name of the module(s) that needed to be loaded during boot up. Now use vi to create a new file, I named it &quot;30-mmc&quot;, put text &quot;mmc&quot; in this file, save and quit vi. </p><p>3. Go to /etc/config directory, open file named &quot;fstab&quot; with vi, add the following block of text to the file, save and quit vi.</p><p>config mount<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target&nbsp; &nbsp;/mnt/sd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;/dev/mmc/disc0/part1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option fstype&nbsp; &nbsp;ext3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option options&nbsp; defaults<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enabled&nbsp; 1</p><p>for my router, I use ext3 file system, and mount point is /mnt/sd. If you mount to /mnt directory, with a different file system, you need to change the above test accordingly. If you you decided mount to a different mount point other than /mnt, you need to create the directory manually, for me, I had to create the sd directory by running &quot;mkdir /mnt/sd&quot;</p><p>After you done all above, reboot your router and the sd card should be mounted.</p>									</div>
