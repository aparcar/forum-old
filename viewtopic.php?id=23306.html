					<p>Hey guys! Trying to scare up some up some textbook money for spring semester so I&#039;m selling a couple WRT54Gs I&#039;ve had lying around the house for a while. Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve got:</p><p>* (1) WRT54G v2, S/N CDF50D7G8132. In very good condition overall, though being several years old there are some light scratches on the body here and there. No internal modifications have been made, though the antennas have been replaced with 7 dBi rubber duck omnis. Comes with power adapter and router as described. $30</p><p>* (1) WRT54G v1, S/N CDF003212077. This was mounted on a wall for the duration of its active life and so is in like-new condition save for some sticker residue on the top where the blue &#039;cap&#039; meets the black body of the enclosure. No internal modifications, stock antennas. I&#039;m afraid that I don&#039;t have the power adapter for this one! $20</p><p>Buyer is responsible for PayPal fees and actual shipping expenses. Let&#039;s make a deal!</p><p>apo</p>									</div>
