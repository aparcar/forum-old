					<p>LogicoZone,</p><p>Was asked this just this morning for an updated series, which just passed the build and boot test now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>---</p><p>I won&#039;t go into too much detail. Some major changes this time around which can be summed up as:<br />- drop linux-4.9, was at 25 patches and rising, running 4.10 for over a month already just fine.<br />- partial failsafe support and initramfs cleanup<br />- use an external regulatory.bin instead of patching it into the kernel<br />- swconfig support for Rango<br />- drop packages which were marked broken as there is no point in fixing them in the first place.<br />- more uapi related changes<br />- kernel patches cleanup round 1</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>swrt-2017-03-09<br />---------------</p><p>* linux-4.9: drop<br />* linux-4.10: bump to 4.10.1, make default<br />* linux-4.11: add 4.11-rc1<br />* linux-next: bump to next-20170227</p><p>* kmod-ubi: drop from series<br />* kmod-ubifs: drop from series<br />* mvebu: enable input subsystem<br />* initramfs-ubiblock: add package<br />* initramfs: use static ubiblock binary<br />* initramfs: implement failsafe</p><p>* wireless-regdb: add package<br />* crda: add package<br />* cfg80211: use crda<br />* kernel: drop regdb patch</p><p>* swconfig: core updates<br />* swconfig: add Rango support (though I&#039;d still use DSA, no question)</p><p>* kmod-rotary-gpio-custom: drop package<br />* kmod-button-hotplug: drop package<br />* kmod-gpio-button-hotplug: drop package<br />* compat-wireless: drop package<br />* kmod-mwlwifi: drop package, depends on compat-wireless<br />* kmod-mt76: drop, depends on compat-wireless, can be converted to use in kernel wireless stack)<br />* hostap-driver: drop package (the last device I had which used this driver died over a decade ago)</p><p>* kernel: more uapi fixups<br />* musl: more uapi fixups<br />* netifd: drop musl fixup<br />* ppp: drop musl fixup<br />* xtables: drop musl fixup<br />* ebtables: proper musl fixup</p><p>* swrt/build_dist.bash: default to non verbose builds, use --verbose if you want<br />* swrt/build_dist.bash: use $MAKEOPTS variable instead of $JOBS</p><p>swrt-2017-03-09.tar.xz: <a href="https://gpldr.in/v/N0PS85lqci/hyIFjRBBiN4tyo4B">https://gpldr.in/v/N0PS85lqci/hyIFjRBBiN4tyo4B</a><br />sha256sum: 3d6600a04e2d6848f16885e95534606397eb05f79a08f835556d23cce901f3d8</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>I have been told numerous times by one or two that I am an ass and I should go home and stop posting.</p><p>I haven&#039;t posted for months. I am; however loosing patience with the sillies on this thread. </p><p>This just got posted here:</p><p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/routers-cia-wikileaks-cyber-security-insecure-1.4017033">http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/route … -1.4017033</a></p><p>The following IS A TIRADE.</p><p>1. It is ABSOLUTELY STUPID that ON ANY BOARD that there have been 2.3 million views&nbsp; and 14,000 replies.</p><p>THIS TOPIC for the Linksys WRT1900AC now includes the 3200 (several generations later) should be CLOSED. Enough of this crap!!!!!!!!</p><p> 2.&nbsp; There are ALMOST NO versions of firmware that are identified as STABLE; LEDE or OPENWRT. Why does it ALWAYS have to be fiddled with.&nbsp; POST A STABLE VERSION SOMEWHERE and leave it alone for 6 months!</p><p>SOMEWHERE in this SHIT is THIS.</p><p>IT is all well and good to chase tommorrow; BUT;;;;;; THERE HAS TO BE A SIGNED OFF STABLE RELEASE; GOOD for many weeks and months and LEDE and OPENWRT seem not to understand that STABILITY is KEY!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>LEDE is having a fight with OPENWRT.&nbsp; AS an owner of one of the first units with a fan; I don&#039;t care.</p><p>Linksys says this product AND all following products have open source firmware available.</p><p>EXACTLY WHERE; are signed off STABLE Versions.</p><p>It seems to me that despite the split (LEDE and OPENWRT); nothing has been resolved for the end user.&nbsp; LEDE bitched about OPENWRT and stability and LEDE has yet to sign off and release a STABLE version that will run for weeks and months.</p><p>I am pissed with the asses at Belkin; but the OEM firmware; which I use; does NOT PISS off this household.</p><p>I am 71 years old; have 3 university students here; and using ANY firmware POSTED here is inviting a disaster.&nbsp; ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.</p><p>It seems that many including Kaloz are using this board to PAD THEIR POCKETS as Linksys employees.</p><p>ADD to this is that David Lin from Linksys; is using this board to supplement the deficiencies at Linksys to USE the experts on this board to fix ( for FREE ) the issues with the driver.</p><p>4. There are an impatient bunch here that are looking for a fast fix from David. IF Linksys changes the driver; ANY firmware IS NULL AND VOID and needs a new FCC approval; which will take months.</p><p>This board needs to get its collective head out of its ass and start lobbying the FCC to rescind a stupid rule; the problem will NOT go away.</p><p>The US is an ASS and has always been an ASS; and there is NO rationality in many instances for the rules that are put in place.</p><p>The US is a bully!! and then US wants to use its (bogus) world wide authority for whatever.</p><p>A drone is going to bring down a plane faster than an errant router running a higher power than authorized.</p><p>Rick </p><p>From Canada</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RickStep</strong> on 10 Mar 2017, 02:07)</p>

					<p>Rick, if you go to ANY opensource project and rant/insult people claiming that they should stop working, you are going to be ignored and told to shut up (and I&#039;m doing so now, at least on this subject)</p><p>you have NO right to tell someone that they cannot spend their time on something.</p><p>If you think that people are presenting something as stable and it isn&#039;t, it is fair to point out the problems that you (or others) are having.</p><p>Please delete your self describe tirade, it does no good and eats up space.</p>									</div>
