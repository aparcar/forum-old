					<p>I was given a DIR-615 vers. E3 and want to install OpenWrt firmware. I have read a lot about OpenWrt and its application to the DIR-615 but it is a bit confusing. </p><p>Some of the information states that the DIR-615 E3 is incompatible with Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 and there&#039;s other information which says it is compatible except that, because there&#039;s only 4Mb of flash rom, the wifi/wireless function can&#039;t be installed. There&#039;s other information which states that wireless can be installed but without the ipv6 function or ppp or something else in order to have enough flash rom room. There&#039;s also other information which states that the E3 and E4 firmware are compatible and that E4 firmware can be use if the &quot;magic&quot; number is changed to the one for the E3. Other information states that the DIR-615 E3 has been merged with the DIR-600 A1 OpenWrt firmware.</p><p>Considering all that, I have managed to install the DIR-615 E4 OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05/LuCI (git-15.248.30277-383b45) kernel version 3.18.20 by changing the E4 magic number to the one for the E3 (AP99-AR7240-RT-091105-01) but the wifi function is missing. I need the wifi function and intend to use the DIR-615 E3 as a VPN router behind my general purpose router which is connected to my cable modem.</p><p>Is there a wifi enabled version of OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 for the DIR-615 E3? If there is I would appreciate someone pointing me to it. If there isn&#039;t a &quot;readymade&quot; would someone write about what I need to do to either modify the existing DIR-615 E4 firmware or whatever is compatible (DIR-600 A1 ???) or another solution to accomplish what I need.</p>									</div>

					<p>The only way to put&nbsp; Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 on a DIR-615 is compile a custom a build without LUCI and config it through the UCI.I have a lot of the E3 and i use Barrier Breaker on all of the them with the luci i just open the firmware in a HEX program and chang the very last number from 5 to 1 and the E4 firmware will go on a E3.</p>									</div>
