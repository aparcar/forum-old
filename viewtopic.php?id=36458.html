					<p>Hi!</p><p>I installed trunk (ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3220-v1-squashfs) rebuild by myself with luci support on a fresh tplink mr3220 (20euro on amazon), everything went smooth. I&#039;ve also put the router in client (station) mode to be a node of my local network (accessible via wireless as a client). No problems. </p><p>Then I&#039;ve opened the router and soldered three wires to three pins of the serial port (TX, RX and ground) on the mainboard. With some care (voltage conversion is needed, see <a href="http://www.hackup.net/2011/09/serial-communication-between-an-arduino-and-the-tl-mr3220-router/">http://www.hackup.net/2011/09/serial-co … 20-router/</a> ) I have connected the wires to the TX-RX pins of an arduino board. On the arduino board there&#039;s a program running, sending strings to the serial line. Basically I want to receive those lines at the router serial port. But I don&#039;t know how. The guy at &quot;hackup.net&quot; suggests simply to use the command &quot;screen&quot; with something like</p><p>&gt; screen /dev/ttyS0 9600</p><p>if I do that, I see only funny characters or - almost always - nothing at all.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried with &quot;microcom&quot; but it says that ttyS0 does not respond. </p><p>You could say &quot;hey, you&#039;ve done bad soldering and your serial is not connected!&quot;. But I have the proof that *something* is coming from arduino to the serial port. Just doing </p><p>&gt;&nbsp; cat /proc/tty/driver/serial</p><p>I get </p><p>0: uart:16550A mmio:0x18020000 irq:11 tx:10760 rx:184717 brk:184716 RTS|DTR|DSR|CD</p><p>and the numbers after &quot;rx:...&quot; and &quot;brk:....&quot;&nbsp; constantly grow!! <br />And if I disconnect the wire going from arduino-tx to router-rx, those number stop to grow!</p><p>In summary, data are flowing but I am not able to read them. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea how to simply read ascii characters from /dev/ttyS0 ? </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>normally the console on serial port is already using that port. did you disable it? don&#039;t know how it behaves if two push and grab data at the same time on a serial line.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. Yes, I did already disable the console association with serial port, i.e. my /etc/inittab reads like this</p><p>::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS S boot<br />::shutdown:/etc/init.d/rcS K shutdown<br />#ttyS0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login</p><p>Unfortunately this is not the problem. </p><p>I am missing some (perhaps trivial) piece of information about linux way of reading devices. Why can&#039;t I simply read /dev/ttyS0 by using &quot;cat&quot;? Is this because the file must be opened in some way? Let&#039;s say that a flow of bytes is coming down through it but the &quot;terminal&quot; emulators cannot interprete it, how can I just see them flowing without any interpretation, only for debugging purpose?</p>									</div>

					<p>you&#039;re right, I forgot that point, thanks! now I cant move on, no resistors and shops closed, have to wait for monday <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>anyway I did originally read that info on the wiki, but 1) havent understood it; 2) the webpage where I learnt the project ( <a href="http://www.hackup.net/2011/09/serial-communication-between-an-arduino-and-the-tl-mr3220-router/">http://www.hackup.net/2011/09/serial-co … 20-router/</a> ) did not mention it, so I assumed it was not important</p><p>indeed I would like to have it better explained: it is said that tx is connected to a voltage divider (2x5.6k) and also a capacitor is put between the pin and the real connector; my questions are</p><p>1) can you sketch such circuit?
