					<p>Hi.<br />I&#039;m not sure if that is a good thing or not... But I bought it because I wanted an N router and Zyxel seemed a good bet - I have had good products from them in the past. I&#039;m fairly technical, but work with servers and storage, have very little experience with hacking routers, certainly nothing close to what you&#039;re describing.</p><p>I hope you&#039;ll figure it out/have someone help you with it.

					<p>According to Zyxel support they&#039;re releasing a new firmware for the 460 (and presumbaly all varities) &quot;some time this month&quot;. They couldn&#039;t say anything about contents, fixes or a more accurate date. Just thought I&#039;d share the info. The Danish website have had some documentation updated, perhaps in preparation for the firmware.</p><p>DJ</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey guys</p><p>according to zyxel UserGuide for nbg460n the router should support WDS, but I do not see it on the Network-&gt;Wireless Lan for x550n, but i thought they are supposed to be same hardware.<br />even after changing the SysOp to AP, still no WDS<br />i did buy the x550n, two of them, and i need to have WDS running.</p><p>Does any of you have nbg460n? can you look at the WirelessLan, the last tab should be WDS after &quot;Scheduling&quot; tab.<br />Im wondering if there is a change/difference between these two(nbg460n and x550n) afterall.</p><p>Thanks<br />-martin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>adammar</strong> on 22 Feb 2009, 08:13)</p>

					<p>I just found on one of their off country ftp sites a hot new beta version of firmware built2/10/2009 posted on 2/24/2009 that HAS among others --- WDS!!!!, the firmware is for nbg460n not x550n but it loaded just fine on my x550n, im off to testing that WDS.</p><p>One of some other diffs I see on this beta firmware:<br />â€¢there is an IPTV PORT option with selection of LAN ports, interesting<br />â€¢On the bandwidth MGMNT screen there is a speed limiter for LAN/WAN/WLAN and expanded Status page with throuput meter for all types of different priority trafic<br />â€¢On Tools - there is a NEW tab called green, which i think is for their power saving mode - turn of TX when no trafic exists.<br />Thats it, Oh Boy do I feel like a kid in candy store,<br />*in the tune of HiHo from 7 dwarfs*<br />.....hiho hiho off to test WDS we go.....</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I just installed the beta firmware and it solved my problem! I&#039;m now happily surfing internally @ 130 mbps connected to the network with 1 gbps with the other one connected @ 54 mbps. One note of caution, it enabled &quot;autobridge mode&quot; which had me a bit stumped. I kept getting the wrong IP addresses, but disabling that got me the right range.</p><p>DJ.</p><p>I am still hoping for OpenWRT though. Still too many things I can&#039;t adjust...</p>									</div>

					<p>DJ,<br />glad it fixed your prob.</p><p>unfortunately the WDS is not working for me well.<br />it doesnt matter which mode I put it in, it cant get above 5Mbps and after about 3-4 hours of operation the routers just stop. cant ping, cant telnet, they just seize up. Im hoping that once the official firmware comes out this wont be a prob.<br />very disapointed.</p><p>one wild thing is that I get end to end connections, but the telnet console status of &quot;wlan wds&quot; prints disconnected lol.<br />*sigh*</p>									</div>
