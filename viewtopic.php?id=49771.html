					<p>Hello,</p><p>how do I enable to use Google Authenticator together with OpenVPN on a TP-WR1043ND v.1.9 router? Does anybody already tried something like this?

					<p>Slightly late, but I stumbled across this post while trying to do the same thing myself.</p><p>I managed to get OpenVPN to use Google Authenticator and a Yubikey configured for TOTP... on my Raspberry Pi. And having got it working on the Pi I wanted to do the same thing on my OpenWRT box.</p><p>The stumbling block is the PAM authenticator plugin for OpenVPN. There isn&#039;t one. At least, there isn&#039;t one conveniently already compiled for OpenWRT.</p><p>There is a Google Authenticator package for OpenWRT, but all that provides is the OATH framework. Individual services (e.g. SSH, OpenVPN, etc.) must be able to talk to Google Authenticator before you can authenticate. And without a suitable PAM plugin compiled for OpenWRT, OpenVPN can&#039;t talk to Google Authenticator.</p><p>I&#039;ve never compiled for OpenWRT before (the most I&#039;ve ever done is fiddle with Image Builder to get OpenWRT on a 4MB device) so I&#039;ve absolutely no idea what might be involved in a) finding the source code for the OpenVPN PAM plugin, and b) compiling it for OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>600cc</strong> on 21 Mar 2016, 23:14)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I don&#039;t have OpenWRT build experience so take this FWIW.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18610">ticket 18610</a> already.&nbsp; From here:</p><p><a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#auth">https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-sour â€¦ .html#auth</a></p><p>&quot;To build the openvpn-auth-pam plugin on Linux, cd to the plugin/auth-pam directory in the OpenVPN source distribution and run make.&quot;</p><p>So, if you are able to build the OpenVPN package, see here:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howtobuild/single.package">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howtobuild/single.package</a></p><p>I&#039;m guessing you need to set up the build environment to build OpenVPN, then patch the Makefile, etc., so it runs make in the plugin/auth-pam subdir.&nbsp; Then there&#039;s the matter of how OpenWRT&#039;s build system packages the config, binary and library files into a .ipk file so you can put the .so file in the right place.&nbsp; Not much to go on but I HTH.</p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>
