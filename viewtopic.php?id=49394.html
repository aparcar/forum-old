					<p>I tried to install openwrt on my tp-link tl-WR703N, it seems I made a mistake in the step of configuring network settings. Now I&#039;m stuck, the tp-link is not responding <br />Is there a trick to remedy this</p>									</div>

					<p>So,&nbsp; have you seen the router at 192.168.1.1 since you flashed it with OpenWrt?&nbsp; Is it still there?&nbsp; If it was and you have edited the network settings and now lost it, then you have two options.&nbsp; <br />Plan A is to search for it using netscan, remembering that you must have a network card on the same subnet as netscan is searching.&nbsp; It might take a long time, especially if you have screwed up the subnet rather than the IP address.<br />Plan B is to treat as a &#039;bricked&#039; router and solder a serial to USB adapter on, get the instructions by googling &#039;bricked wr703n&#039;.&nbsp; This might take even longer if your soldering skills are not up to it and you might finish up with a dead router.<br />Best of luck, <br />John</p>									</div>
