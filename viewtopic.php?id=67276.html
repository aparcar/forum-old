					<p>Hello,<br />I am using OpenWRT 15.05.1 on a TP-Link WR841 router in default configuration.</p><p>Using the default configuration, a DNS entry in the .lan zone is added for each DHCP client. Unfortunately, only a client&#039;s internal IPv4 address is added to &lt;hostname&gt;.lan, but not its global unicast IPv6 address, which is assigned with DHCPv6.</p><p>I added a custom hostname for my PC in /etc/config/dhcp:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config host
        option mac &#039;3c:07:71:xx:xx:xx&#039;
        option name &#039;mypc&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I can ping mypc.lan without problems, but IPv6 does not work.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ping mypc.lan
PING mypc.lan (192.168.1.159): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.159: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.727 ms</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ping6 mypc.lan
ping6: bad address &#039;mypc.lan&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Is there any possibility to dynamically add a hosts IPv6 address to its internal .lan DNS entry? Preferably, I would use dnsmasq perferably, because it is pre-installed and is quite lightweight.</p><p>My final goal is to zone-transfer the local .lan zone to my global nameserver to be able to reach my hosts via IPv6 on the internet. I would change the .lan zone to the appropriate subdomain of course. This is necessary, because my ISP assigns changing IPv6 prefixes every 24h.</p><p>//edit: I just recognized, that the routers hostname (which is router.lan in my setup), is also only resolveable using IPv4, not via IPv6.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />CSG07</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CSG07</strong> on 31 Aug 2016, 00:03)</p>
