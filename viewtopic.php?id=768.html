					<p>Hello,</p><p>I just installed OpenWRT on my WRT54, in fact OpenWRT is the reason I bought this box.</p><p>Now I wonder if there is a package for OpenWRT containing an 802.1x-client for doing EAP-Authentification on a wired LAN connection. </p><p>I&#039;m using <em>xsupplicant</em> (<a href="http://www.open1x.org">http://www.open1x.org</a>) on my linux-box at the moment to be able to connect to a university network.</p><p>If no package exists, is there a HowTo explaining how to cross-compile for OpenWRT? It shoudn&#039;t be that complicated for xsupplicant, I think, or, mmh, hope.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Marcel</p>									</div>

					<p>Can anybody provide a link to someplace describing how to setup a complete system? This looks like it is just the thing I am looking for but I need to know how to get it setup. I googled but that has not returned much. So if anybody has a good link(s) I would love to hear it. I am especially interested in the TTLS stuff.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did read the Open1x documentation cover to cover that was not quite what I was looking for.</p><p>What I was wondering if there is a good link to setting up a authenticator. That the Xsupplicant could use.</p><p>The documentaion does not talk about that at all so is there anything else out there? Is Open1x not the program to use as the authenticator?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are looking for an authenticator that works with a RADIUS and not with a supplicant, then you have the nas binary provided by linksys here :</p><p><a href="http://nthill.free.fr/openwrt/ipkg/stable/20041003/nas_0.1-2_mipsel.ipk">http://nthill.free.fr/openwrt/ipkg/stab … mipsel.ipk</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Closer, I want to test the OpenWRT supplicant. I have a radius server and an AP that does not/can not act as an authenticator. However I do have a linux device behind it that I am hoping could act as the authenticator. </p><p>With that linux box behind the AP acting as an authenticator I would have the complete system so that I could test out OpenWRT Xsupplicant package. Hope that makes things a little more clear.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should set up HostAP on your Linux box, and make the wrt connect it as a &quot;managed&quot; client. Then you can try the 802.1x auth if you have a radius server installed on your linux box or anywhere else.</p>									</div>
