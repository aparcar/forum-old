					<p>Hello Folks,<br />sorry for asking daftly, but I have a small technical problem. I set up my OpenWRT building environment and want to end up compiling WiringPi. This requires the libraries libpthreads and librt, both of which I already activated in the Base System option. However, the compile still fails with an ld error.</p><p>I diud already try to find the so files on the generated image, but they are not there. Even more stringent, I found two files in /openwrt/bin/brcm2708/packages/base even though I set the compile to be * (aka embed);<br />libpthread_1.1.16-1_brcm2708.ipk<br />librt_1.1.16-1_brcm2708.ipk</p><p>Sadly, decompressing both of them yields an empty content tar.gz - it is as if the libraries are not built.</p><p>Does anyone of you have any ideas about how to solve the problem maybe?</p><p>Tam</p>									</div>
