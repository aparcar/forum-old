					<p>heya,</p><p>I just wanted to clarify a couple of points regarding upgrading OpenWRT</p><p>Previously, I installed/upgraded my RouterStation Pro via recovery mode (hold down reset button for ten seconds while powering on, then TFT across factory image).</p><p>However, I have a few questions regarding the images.</p><p>1. What&#039;s the difference between sysupgrade and factory images? My understanding is that sysupgrade is for uploading to the router, then upgrading using the sysupgrade command, and that factory is for upgrading as I described above, using a router&#039;s in-built recovery mode? Is this correct? What is the actual difference, build-wise, between the two images?</p><p>2. Which image would you use for upgrading via Luci&#039;s web interface (System - Flash Firmware)?</p><p>3. What&#039;s the difference between squashfs and jffs2 images? I understand these are different filesystems, but under which circumstance would you use either, and why? (I was previously told before somehwere to use squashfs on my RouterStation Pro, however, I&#039;m curious as to the raesons why.)</p><p>4. Using &quot;opkg upgrade&quot; to upgrade your router is bad, right? Why is this?</p><p>5. What&#039;s the best alternative to using firmware recovery mode? If I do a sysupgrade, is that &quot;just as good&quot;? No stale stuff leftover from before? Then I just run opkg to install luci again?</p><p>Would appreciate any answers that might shed light on the above <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Victor</p>									</div>
