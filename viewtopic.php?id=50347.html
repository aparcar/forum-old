					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;ve been talking to an ed-tech nonprofit in Rwanda (<a href="http://kepler.org/">http://kepler.org/</a>), and they have an interesting problem:</p><p>Net access in Rwanda is... weird. There&#039;s actually a pretty big fiber infrastructure, but no one can afford to use it, so most home networking is done with 3G routers instead. I was talking to them about helping them set up some kind of proxy solution to minimize bandwidth needs, but the problem is that many of these 3G plans have bandwidth caps so they plan to have multiple routers, and just assign each student to a router, which could make giving everyone access to the proxy difficult. </p><p>I then had an idea, but I&#039;m very much not a router/network guy so I&#039;d like to post it here for sanity checking and advice. What if they...</p><p>1. Disabled the WAP features of the 3G routers, so they basically just do wired&lt;-&gt;3G</p><p>2. Set up an OpenWRT WAP with all of their routers (and the proxy server) plugged into it</p><p>3. Somehow configured OpenWRT to spread outbound traffic between the 3G routers and/or stop sending traffic to a router when its bandwidth cap is hit (ie when it stops reliably sending traffic)</p><p>The idea would be for all of the students to connect to the same WAP, and thus be on the same LAN, and have the WAP deal with figuring out how to juggle 3G routers. </p><p>To me this seems like a bizarre but plausible setup, but again I don&#039;t do this sort of networking stuff very much, so maybe it&#039;s either completely unworkable or quite common. </p><p>If anyone can provide guidance about this, I would appreciate it!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>usernamenumber</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 17:20)</p>

					<p>Interesting Idea indeed !</p><p>We have a develoment playground and checking multi-gateway-mesh with batman-advanced.</p><p>The scope is to have some automatic failover between several internet-gatways ( no load balance )<br /> like Freifunk Oldenburg in Germany. </p><p>Practically its working fine and we are in the process to find the right parameters for the mesh-cloud spread over far-radio links</p><p>Have a look at the gateway mechanism <a href="http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/Gateways">http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batma â€¦ i/Gateways</a></p><p>Maybe it suites your usecase. Implementation is not that difficult excpt you have to build your own images.</p><p>regards<br />3zl</p>									</div>

					<p>That looks really cool, but possibly overkill for me. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>We should be able to cable the 3G routers to the WAP with regular ethernet (as opposed to a wireless mesh), and based on research I&#039;ve done since my initial post, it seems something like step 3 of <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/Networking/Linux_Router_Configuration_0">these instructions</a> may be all I need. </p><p>Is there any reason something like that (multiple default routes plus setting gc_timeout in sysctl) wouldn&#039;t work on, say, a linksys running OpenWRT?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>usernamenumber</strong> on 29 Apr 2014, 00:41)</p>
