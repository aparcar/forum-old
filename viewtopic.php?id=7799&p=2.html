					<p>if your atheros based device is using redboot (fonera and meraki, among others), you most likely can. documentation on redboot is here, read it before doing anything, as generally redboot will do stupid things if you tell it to, and if you erase or badly screw up redboot, you will probably need jtag to fix it:<br /><a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-latest/redboot/redboot-guide.html">http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-latest/ … guide.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>thanks casper!</p><p>I tried to compile and flash kamikaze according to your litte &quot;how-to-do&quot; <br />and I have the same problem as pax0r. I tried to fix it myself, but there are many troubles with the patches for the madwifi-modules. Should they really be applied to the Version 0.9.0? because they often reference to the wrong line-numbers and thing like that. <br />I gave up fixing it myself for now, but I compiled kamikaze without the madwifi-driver, and had no problem at all. <br />I flashed it and now it´s working on my la fonera. <br />Ok, an accesspoint without an wlan-interface isn´t that useful <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> , but it´s&nbsp; good to see, that it is possible the put openwrt on it. <br />the last thing that´s missing is a working madwifi driver. so maybe someone has an idea, how to fix this?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am building your code now to try it on a Meraki Mini...</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>casperado wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I forgot to mention that before unpacking my patch you have to delete the madwifi package that comes with kamikaze,<br />eg.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> rm -Rf packages/madwifi</code></pre></div><p>Casper</p></blockquote></div><p>That begs the question of how we deal with this going forward when integrating this work into the tree. Should there be separate packages &quot;madwifi&quot; and &quot;madwifi-ar531x&quot; for example? This seems to be necessary, at least because of the base address changes in ath/if_ath_ahb.c, unless we can (safely) make a single module that probes both ranges.</p><p>Also, your package seems to be based on madwifi-ng-r1486, which is 9 months old - presumably because fon&#039;s was. I expect it would be better to use say madwifi 0.9.2.1 as a base, but then you have to identify which of fon&#039;s patches still need to be applied to this.</p><p>Ultimately such patches, if important or useful, ought to find there way back into the main madwifi tree. If fon won&#039;t do this, then maybe we should submit them.</p><p>One other thing - any reason why this needs a 2.4 kernel? I&#039;ve read here that 2.4 kernel support will be dropped from Kamikaze as soon as there&#039;s a working 2.6 broadcom driver.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for the great work! - Brian.</p>									</div>

					<p>I should point out that the meraki firmware, and redboot, uses a serial rate of 115200, while the fon and most firmware for it (excluding my own, hehe), uses 9600. so you have to quickly switch to 9600 after you press enter on exec to get early output, or switch redboot to use 9600</p><p>I have my own kernel that boots on the fon and recognizes the partitions and such, based on meraki&#039;s 2.6.16.16 and it&#039;s associated drivers, but it&#039;s a messy hack, and has largly been superseded in functionality now.</p><p>my own flash layout uses a 2mb partition for linux kernels, and a 3mb jffs2 root partition, in addition to the redboot internal partitions (there is unused space, yes, I wanted to be able to test multiple things without erasing). since linux can automatically detect redboot partitions on boot, the flash layout isn&#039;t really much of a problem imo, provided you know how to use redboot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>you can telnet into redboot on the stock meraki, if you are quick and configure your ip settings properly. only person I asked about the fon hardware has changed his settings too much to make a determination of whether it would work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cris:</p><p>Thanks for the advice, it was really possible to reflash a working fonera without opening/connecting serial-ttl adapters. Today is compile-time (the basic packages are there, but I miss some useful tools)...</p><p>About the Redboot_Config partition, I think we don&#039;t have avaliable tools to generate a default configuration &quot;with fixed IP and telnet window after boot&quot;, I must read the Redboot documentation. These are completely new hardware and tools for me!</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>
