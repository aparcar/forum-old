					<p>That&#039;s what I thought would happen. Anyway, it looks like both OpenWRT and dd-WRT would need to use the open source b43 driver for the broadcom radio card (i.e. bcm4321 in the case of WL-500W) which unfortunately is lacking at the moment.</p><p>Keeping the fingers crossed.</p><p>Zinahe A.</p>									</div>
