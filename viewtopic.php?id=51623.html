					<p>Yeah, thanks for that!<br />So your assessment concerning my u-boot have really proved to be right:</p><p>All I did was exchange the installed u-boot against your version. That made every other image boot the way it was expected.<br />Spent the rest of my time yesterday to get the webserver running, but I haven&#039;t succeeded yet. Tried to keep to the wiki, but some of the files mentioned there are packed into other packages in the new version, so it&#039;s &#039;try and error&#039; to a high extent. :-(</p><p>Anyway, your advice has saved my day after all....thanx again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Short update on the topic here:</p><p>Managed to install and boot the image from: barrier_breaker/14.07-rc1/lantiq/xway/</p><p>The result is a rather disappointing one, though.</p><p>Again I&#039;m not getting a DSL-connection, so the first thing I checked was having the fitting firmware installed.</p><p>Believe it or not, this image comes with Annex-B firmware installed whereas /etc/config/network&nbsp; has these lines:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config adsl &#039;dsl&#039;

However, making the neccessary change did not bring about the desired DSL-connection. I&#039;d be happy to interchange experience with anybody else who tried.</p><p>Personally, I was a bit unhappy that the image came without an installed uhttpd. Not a joyful task to install it offline for someone impatient like me and with almost no experience.</p><p>Desperately looking for someone who&#039;s got it running now....</p>									</div>
