					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am trying to filter traffics that go through my AP. I have, for example, 2 wireless clients. Client A pings client B as they are connected through WLAN0 interface on my OpenWRT router (I am using Raspberry Pi 2 for the router).<br />In this scenario, client A can certainly ping client B. Then I tried to deploy a netfilter rule: &quot;iptables -A FORWARD -j REJECT -p icmp&quot;, but the traffics don&#039;t seem to be filtered by the iptables. I tried iptables to filter traffics between 2 interfaces, e.g. WLAN0 and LAN0, and it works just fine as expected because it filters the traffic that goes from one interface to another.</p><p>Does anyone know any method to filter this traffic from client A to B that are connected to the AP (only one interface)? Or do we have to hack iptables to do this?</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Kind regards,<br />Rahmadi</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks stas2z, I&#039;ve just tried it but it doesn&#039;t seem to have any effects. I tried something like this:</p><p>ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p ipv4 -i wlan0 --ip-dst X.X.X.X -j DROP</p><p>Isn&#039;t it that ebtables is also for bridging? At the Wifi AP, it doesn&#039;t seem to me that it&#039;s bridging the clients because AFAIK a bridge is supposed to bridge 2 interfaces right?</p>									</div>

					<p>I see. I am aware of that ap isolation too, but for our case, we want to differentiate traffics based on IP addresses and port numbers too. So, we need something that&#039;s more fine-grained. Do you know anything like this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay I&#039;ve got my answer. So, to do this we have to:</p><p>1) Set AP isolation (set option isolate &#039;1&#039;&nbsp; in wifi-iface of /etc/config/wireless).<br />2) Once the wireless clients are isolated, we deploy bridge hairpin mode: brctl hairpin br-wifi wlan0 on, that enables clients to talk again because our wlan0 is now a bridge between the wireless clients.<br />3) Use iptables/nftables etc. to set our filters.</p><p>Hope that helps anyone that has the same problem. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>And don&#039;t forget to set our wlan0 interface as a bridge (option type &#039;bridge&#039;) and also set net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf to make iptables work in bridge mode.</p>									</div>
