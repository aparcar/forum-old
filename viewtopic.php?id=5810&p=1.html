					<p>Hey everybody,</p><p>I recently upgraded to RC5 (from RC2) and now my mmc.o module fails on load with the following:</p><p>mmc Hardware init<br />mmc Card init<br />mmc Card init<br />mmc: error in mmc_card_init (1)<br />mmc: error in mmc_init (-1)</p><p>I&#039;ve checked and rechecked my connections, and all appears to be fine with them.&nbsp; The only change that I&#039;m aware of making is the upgrade to RC5.&nbsp; I&#039;ve recompiled the driver with the same result.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried the minimum stock RC5 firmware and a custom-built one.</p><p>Are there any new things added to RC5 that would interfere with the mmc module?&nbsp; Have the GPIO pins been reassigned somehow?</p><p>I greatly appreciate any help that can be provided on this.&nbsp; I had been using the MMC module for running a number of apps that I just won&#039;t be able to do without it.</p><p>Thanks again,<br />Jon</p>									</div>

					<p>the #defines for your GPIO to SD_CLOCK/SD_DO etc. mappings are needed to build mmc.o, which or course depends on the version of hardware and how you wired it.

					<p>My computer with buildroot on it is packed due to a recent move. I&#039;ll get it setup tonight maybe and find the mmc.o and get it posted.</p><p>From the details you posted, I believe we have the same board. My mmc.o should work for you if you physically wired it like the original kiel website pictures show. That&#039;s what i did and then altered the defines in mmc.c.&nbsp; That is the original &quot;wiring vs gpio mapping&quot; issue for what i guess could be called v1.1 GS units.</p><p>The next issue cropped up with RC5 in that the GPIO4 was not being set as a input or output properly by the mmc.o module. mmc.o just starts using GPIO4 as an ouput, but the pull up resistor is still switched in so it seems stuck high (as i recall). The gpio_control register seems to control the pullup resistors on each GPIO. The fix was to have mmc.o write to gpio_control to make GPIO4 an ouptut. This gets you back to where things work but our particular board is wired backwards from the kiel website pics. So you still need the original swapped defines as i found previously.</p><p>I believe the diag module in rc5 sets up gpio 4 as the cisco button.. an input, pulled high by pull up resistors, so when mmc.o uses it, it needs to remove the pullup so that it can work properly as an output.</p><p>I didn&#039;t do anything with diag module in the end. Although i think if you prevent it from configuring GPIO 4 &quot;cisco button&quot; as an input things may work, since the GPIO4 seems to be in output after power on. But that&#039;s not the way I think it should be done. I think mmc.o should setup the GPIO&#039;s the way it wants them (as mbm pointed out way back when).</p><p>At least the above is how I remember things.</p><p>I&#039;ll get that module posted somewhere tonight hopefully.</p><p>greg</p>									</div>
