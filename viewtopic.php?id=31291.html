					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m a HAM radio operator and priviledged to be able to help with the construction of the HAMNET in South Tyrol - Italy.<br />For those who not know, HAMNET is a WiFi based network for HAM radio. We use it as a backbone service for packet radio, APRS, and much more.</p><p>Now to my problem:<br />We have received for free about 40 Alvarion Subscriber Units that are no longer in use. But they don&#039;t use standart WiFi (even if they use a standart WiFi chipset).<br />And without a Router Unit we can&#039;t use these devices. My colleagues had the idea to remove the Alvarion hardware and use the enclosure (with 5,6GHz patch antenna) for Mikrotik hardware.<br />BUT the Alvarion hardware is really high quality and, in my opinion it would be a shame not to use it (it would be cheaper too).<br />So i thought about using OpenWRT, wich brings me to you.</p><p>I myself am not a Linux Guru and search some advice and help from you.</p><p>But first a bit technical data one the Device:<br />Model: SU-A-5.4-3-1D-VL<br />Processor: PowerPC MPC603e (Chip = Processor + PCIBridge = MPC8245)<br />SDRAM: 2x MT48LC2M32B2 (2x 64MBit)<br />Flash: JS28F640J3D (64Mbit)<br />Ethernet MAC: DP83816<br />and a CPLD<br />WiFi Chipset: Atheros</p><p>Now to my questions:<br />I have found binaries of OpenWRT for PowerPC processors, but none for the PowerPC 6xx series. Can I use another one or do i need to compile my own?</p><p>I don&#039;t know the boot loader of the device but i get this output at boot:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>POST...
