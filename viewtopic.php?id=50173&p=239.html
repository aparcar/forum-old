					<p>@stesmi &amp; davidc502</p><p>Pure NAT gives me speeds around 900 Mbps. I am still getting 550 Mbps when using PPPoE (which is the protocol required by my ISP). That&#039;s why I ended up getting an Edgerouter Lite and have set it up to handle the PPPoE connection, because it offloads the PPPoE traffic to a dedicated engine. Now I am seeing speeds close to the 900 Mbps mark behind the WRT too.</p><p>nitroshift</p><p>PS. I am still testing with latest kernels, but my builds won&#039;t be available online in the foreseeable future until issues are ironed out with the wireless driver. For example, right now I am running kernel 4.0.6 on both my WRT&#039;s and I&#039;m playing with 4.1 final which breaks the switch driver...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nitroshift</strong> on 29 Jun 2015, 07:10)</p>
