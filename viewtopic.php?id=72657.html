					<p>Surprisingly few people know that you can pass a tar.gz archive to sysupgrade containing files you want to keep (or, for that matter, <em>any</em> files you want to be there after the sysupgrade, they can be anywhere in the file system).</p><p>See the <em>-f &lt;config&gt;</em> option to submit that tar.gz archive to sysupgrade. If you want an example for that archive, run <em>sysupgrade -b &lt;file&gt;</em>. It may be easier to have a full backup archive generated and just remove the files you don&#039;t want to keep.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 28 Nov 2017, 12:45)</p>

					<p>Upon re-reading about your situation, I&#039;m not sure the above would really help you since the user would have to manually supply the archive and add that parameter to sysupgrade on the command line.</p><p>Pragmatically speaking, what I can think of is a combination of two custom files in the image: one that contains the configuration in a different file/archive, and a small init script that copies/moves/extracts it to their intended location upon first boot (Edit: in /etc/uci-defaults, as hnyman describes below).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 28 Nov 2017, 18:58)</p>
