					<p>I recently purchased a TPLINK WA901ND AP, expecting a v3 which is supported by openwrt.&nbsp; I received the new v4 revision, which appears just recently started shipping.</p><p>The stock firmware unfortunately does not support operating as a full router w/ NAT, which was how I intended to use the device.</p><p>The SoC (CPU/wifi) is a TP9343 (chip says TP9343-AL3A).&nbsp; The board otherwise looks identical to revision v3.</p><p>This chip is also used in the TP-LINK TL-WR941ND v6.x/TL-WR940ND v3.x.&nbsp; There are some notes about WR941ND v6 support, which seem to suggest it is supported with a custom build only (generated images cause kernel faults) - <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=293475">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=293475</a> &amp; <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/504451/">http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/504451/</a> .</p><p>I have build my own openwrt images before, but never for an unsupported device.&nbsp; Does anyone else have one of these and is working on support, or should I try to get a serial console working and venture into this myself?</p><p>Any tips?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phzi</strong> on 3 Oct 2015, 01:08)</p>
