					<p>I am running Openvpn between two openwrt routers and everything works.&nbsp; <br />When I try to run openvpn over stunnel traffic will not route.&nbsp; Openvpn establishes the tunnel assigns the ip address to tun0 and adds the routes, but traffic will not pass.&nbsp; </p><p>Is there something simple I am missing?

					<p>Yes... I think I had the same problem some weeks ago... I believe the problem was...</p><p>OpenVPN &quot;understands&quot; that it cannot route the VPN traffic through itself, and fixes the routing table in such a way that the VPN server (remote) is not routed through tun0.</p><p>But when remote=127.0.0.1 OpenVPN does not fix any special routing for the VPN server. And stunnel has no idea what is happening, and will innocently try to route (VPN) traffic via tun0, which obviously is not going to work.</p><p>I ended up using my old WRT54GL as an independent server on the network to only provide the stunnel. It has no other gateway/routing/firewall/wireless responsibilities whatsoever.&nbsp; That way, my VPN client OpenVPN can reserve routing to WRT54GL/stunnel. And the WRT54GL effectively looks like the VPN server for all practical purposes.</p><p>I suppose you can also run the &quot;route&quot; command manually to fix the route to the VPN server on the VPN Client. And perhaps you can fix this in the OpenVPN configuration.</p><p>I hope I did not completely misunderstand your problem and answered the wrong question <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You are correct in your assessment of the issue.&nbsp; I did the exact same test last night using a linux vm as the stunnel host and it works fine.&nbsp; </p><p>I have turned on logging on the openwrt box.&nbsp; Ideally I would like to keep it all on one system.&nbsp; It is odd that the route exists in the table, but will not route back.&nbsp; I think it may have something to to with the 127.0.0.1 address that openvpn sees.&nbsp; I will try to add static routes to the tun0/1 interfaces to see if I can fix the issue.&nbsp; </p><p>I will update when I figure it out.</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>									</div>
