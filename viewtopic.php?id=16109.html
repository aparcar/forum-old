					<p>I have a main router/AP (running openwrt) on the 192.168.1.x subnet which wifi signal is received by another router running dd-wrt (I have no choice due to the low flash memory) on 192.168.2.x as client mode.</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot connect to the printers connected to the dd-wrt router on 2.x (from 1.x), but everything else works ok (I can connect to the 1.x subnet from 2.x without problem).</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>The dd-wrt router is the wifi client? Do you use NAT on dd-wrt? Or plain routing? Are default gateways setup correctly on all devices on both sides?</p>									</div>
