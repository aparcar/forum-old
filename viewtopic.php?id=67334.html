					<p>I built OpenWrt for a MediaTek Linkit Smart 7688 board, first using the MediaTek driver and then using the mt76 driver. I ran the board in WiFi station mode. Using the MediaTek driver, the WiFi range was comparable to what I get on my mobile phone - it worked up to about 20 yards away from the building in which the WiFi router was located. However with the mt76 driver, as soon as I went outside the building, the WiFi connection was lost.</p><p>The MediaTek driver version was built following the instructions on the MediaTek website.</p><p>The mt76 driver version was built using OpenWrt git master. The menuconfig options used were:</p><p>Target system: Ralink RT288x/RT3xxx<br />Subtarget: MT7688 based boards<br />Target profile: LinkIt7688</p><p>We&#039;ve been getting similar range problems on another board with an MT7688 chip, using mt76.</p>									</div>

					<p>no, it&#039;s not a 7601/7610, it&#039;s a newer chip (7603/7628/7688), mt76 supports 7603, but as it&#039;s added not so much time ago it can be buggy</p><p>i think it&#039;s a calibration data reading/decoding issue, seems like tx power setup is wrong</p>									</div>
