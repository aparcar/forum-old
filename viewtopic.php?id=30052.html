					<p>So what i&#039;m trying to do is build a image with wireless support built in and with some custom network and firewall settings. </p><p>I downloaded the OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-ar71xx-for-Linux-i686 , im building the images in Unbuntu 10.04</p><p>I build the files with the following command make image PROFILE=&quot;UBNT&quot; PACKAGES=&quot;kmod-mac80211 kmod-ath kmod-ath9k wpad-mini&quot; FILES=&quot;config_files&quot; </p><p>The flash of the Nano Station is successful but the deice is un-responsive on the ip given to it by my dhcp server. I have been able to get a few pings back but then it stops responding. </p><p>My guess is that i&#039;m building the images incorrectly or I am not including the correct packages and this is causing the nano Station to lock up. I can re-flash that device with openwrt-ar71xx-ubnt-nano-m-squashfs-factory.bin and get it working but then its the default config, Then I add my changes and packages to get wifi working ect. How would I go about then taking all the settings and packages installed and feed that back into the Image Builder ? </p><p> Note I have tried building the image with out my config files and it still causes the Nano Station to lock up.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
