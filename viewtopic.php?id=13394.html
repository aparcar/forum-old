					<p>I&#039;m confronted with a similar problem: I&#039;m running Kamikaze 7.09 on a WRT54GS with 2 wifi-ifaces (sta and ap), both are used with a bridge lan interface.</p><p>The problem is related to the client connection. Sometimes the connection to the ap is lost and OpenWRT doesn&#039;t autoreconnect. Calling /sbin/wifi brings the connection back up.<br />When the connection is lost &quot;wl sta_info ...&quot; still reports &quot;state: AUTHENTICATED ASSOCIATED AUTHORIZED&quot;, but it isn&#039;t possible to ping the ap (or any pc connected to the ap).</p><p>I found the parameter statimeout of wlc that is not set by the broadcom.sh script, but i&#039;m not sure if setting this parameter will change anything at all. </p><p>Any idea how to solve the problem or how to get more information about the cause of the problem?</p>									</div>
