					<p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I have had some issues with connectivity and bufferbloat on my Hitron Technologies modem-router, and would like to fix it by attaching a TP-Link router and installing OpenWRT for SQM features. I have not decided entirely on the router I will buy (although it will likely be the TL-WR841N), but I wanted to ask a couple questions to you lovely folk before I begin. </p><p>1. Just to be sure, do you think adding the TP-Link router with OpenWRT/SQM to my Hitron modem-router will help with bufferbloat? There is conflicting information on the interwebs. </p><p>2. Do you have some ideas on the general process necessary to accomplish this installation? Here is my understanding: </p><p>- Install the router on the neetwork normally (as suggested in the guide from TP-Link) <br />- Ensure the internet is working<br />- Now turn off the WiFi and connect via ethernet<br />- Follow the device-speicific steps for installing OpenWRT (according to the OpenWRT website)<br />- Install SQM according to the OpenWRT website</p><p>Is this the correct sequence of events? Also, because I am attaching the TP-Link to a modem that also transmits a wifi signal, do I need to somehow disable that signal coming from the Hitron so it instead is routed through the router? Or does this happen autmoatically? </p><br /><p>Thank you for your help!</p>									</div>
