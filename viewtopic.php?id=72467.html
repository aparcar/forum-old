					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I was wondering if it&#039;s possible for openwrt to automatically request the dhcp server for a new ip. For example, If I switch OpenWrt device from one router to another, while the device is on, it fails to show up in that routers DHCP list and thus causes DNS resolution errors from my Openwrt device. Doing &quot;/etc/init.d/network restart&quot; fixes this issue, but I was wondering if there is a process in openwrt that can detect and request a new IP automatically. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
