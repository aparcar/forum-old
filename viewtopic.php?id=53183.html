					<p>Hi,<br />I have problem with WiFi signal with my TP-Link 1043nd V2. I&#039;ve changed the channel, and some parameters but when I am about 4 meters ago the signal loses strength.<br />I would like to know if I change the original firmware to OpenWrt if I can gain some signal strength or is unnecessary.<br />Many thanks and sorry for my English!</p>									</div>

					<p>You might have a hardware problem if it&#039;s working that poorly. TP-Link stock firmware generally works ok. You can try OpenWrt and it might help. It&#039;s free, but there&#039;s always a risk of bricking your router when flashing any firmware.</p>									</div>

My worries are&nbsp; how could I put the same configuration with openwrt that I have know, because to put the tp-link configuration I only connect a Ethernet to wlan port of my tp-link and&nbsp; it setups alone without problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>yes of course, but there is a couple quirks to revert a TP-Link so read the wiki carefully. The key is that you can&#039;t flash a stock firmware file with a boot partition when reverting. This needs to removed and should be documented in the wiki</p>									</div>
