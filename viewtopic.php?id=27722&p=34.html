					<p>Hi arokh,<br />Thank you for an excellent easy to user firmware build for the WNDR3700v1. I really like your updates.</p><p>I just moved to OpenWrt in the last few days and you have been my source of inpiration to flash my WNDR3700v1 to OpenWrt.</p><br /><p>arokh,<br />I would appreciate if you or anyone in this forum could help me with configuring my WNDR3700v1 with SSID based VLAN.<br />Here is my setup...</p><p>Netgear GS108Tv2 is my backbone. It has 8 ports.</p><p>VLAN 10 - LAN (10.0.0.1)<br />VLAN 20 - WAN (Public IP)<br />VLAN 2 - VoIP (10.0.2.1)<br />VLAN 3 - Video (10.0.3.1)</p><p>Port 1 - Modem (VLAN 20)<br />Port 2 - pfSense WAN (VLAN 20)<br />Port 3 - pfSense LAN (VLAN 10)<br />Port 4 - WNDR3700v1 (As an AP) (VLAN 10)<br />Port 5 &amp; 6 - LAN&nbsp; (VLAN 10) 10.0.0.x<br />Port 7 - SetTop box (VLAN 3) 10.0.3.x<br />Port 8 - ATA (VLAN 2) 10.0.2.x</p><p>Everything is working smoothly and as you can see each VLAN has its own subnet. But all these are in port based VLAN with their respective PVIDs.</p><p>I have quiet a lot of other wireless devices connecting to the network through WNDR3700v1 which is acting as an AP. All these devices are getting the default LAN (VLAN 10) 10.0.0.x subnet IPs. There is a mix of LAN, VoIP and Video devices connecting through WNDR3700v1 and I would like them to connect to their specific subnets only rather than to local LAN.</p><p>I am thinking of SSID based VLAN tagging for all these devices. Is this possible with your latest firmware?</p><p>So my WNDR3700 config should look something like this.</p><p>Default 11G/N SSID - LAN (VLAN 10) Subnet 10.0.0.x<br />Default 11A/N SSID - LAN (VLAN 10) Subnet 10.0.0.x</p><p>Virtual VoIP SSID 11G/N - VoIP (VLAN 2) Subnet 10.0.2.1<br />Virtual Video SSID 11G/N - Video (VLAN 3) Subnet 10.0.3.1</p><p>Since all my devices (except laptops) are only 11G/N capable, I do not need 11A/N for other VLANs except for the local LAN.</p><p>Also, if I could use the WNDR3700v1 WAN port as an uplink port from the Netgear switch then I can make use of all the 4 physical ports on it for attaching other physical devices to it. The 4 physical LAN ports could be on my local LAN (VLAN 10) for now.</p><p>I read a lot but totally confused on how to configure the WNDR3700v1 with OpenWrt to achieve the above config.</p><p>I would highly highly highly appreciate if you could post me the config that I can copy paste and get my WNDR3700v2 up and running.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think there&#039;s a problem with minissdpd, it seems to stop working after a short while and won&#039;t respond to discoveries. Looks like for now you&#039;ll need disable it and only run one of the services at a time. Might have put too much faith in a project that hasn&#039;t seen any updates for 3 years. Will look for a solution.</p><p>@banstro</p><p>You can&#039;t do tagging on an access port, it will need to be in trunk mode. VLAN tag based on SSID?
