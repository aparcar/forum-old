					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to write a small programm that communicates with a JSON-REST-API (get, post, update, delete). The programm will run on OpenWrt and should use as low space as possible.</p><p>What would be the recommended way to do this concerning language and libraries?</p><p>Kind regards<br />Floh1111</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Floh1111</strong> on 10 Jun 2015, 22:01)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>thank you for your answers and sorry for my late reply. I accidently had notifications turned off. To answer zo0ok&#039;s question everything will be on client side. So IÂ´m searching for a http client and a json encoder/decoder.</p><p>I already looked into some commit messages of uclient and it looks promising because it is deeply integrated in openwrt so it will hopefully already be integrated in our firmware.</p><p>Is there a JSON library that you can recommend to use in combination with uclient?</p>									</div>

					<p>Depending on your needs, OpenWrt comes with busybox which in turn supports/includes a simple version of wget . A very simple http client available from the command line. You can of course call it from any script or program.</p><p>Don&#039;t know anything of JSON libraries, but<br /> - writing JSON is always easy even without a library<br /> - reading JSON: if you have a few well known not very complicated documents to read, you can easily and successfully parse data without a library. To read entirely dynamic/unknown documents you should have a library, of course.</p>									</div>
