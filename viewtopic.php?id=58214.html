					<p>**sorry, I posted this in the wrong forum** deleted the old one, and put it here.</p><p>So, I have almost everything setup for my device, which I plan on using in hotels during travel, and to do my job.</p><p>client &lt;----(wlan0)----&gt;wr703n&lt;-----eth0(dhcp)----&gt;Hotel/work ETH port &lt;---&gt; Internet</p><p>I&#039;ve gotten the AP configured, and the client can get an IP address, and the LAN side is configured and can receive an IP address.<br />I can SSH to the 703n on both the WAN and LAN segments. On the WAN side, I can ping the gateway (192.168.2.1), and ping the LAN IP (10.0.0.20 in this case), but I cannot get Internet access, nor can I ping/traceroute to the home network&#039;s router at 10.0.0.1.&nbsp; I can confirm the 703n has Internet connectivity, as I downloaded the &#039;opkg update&#039; with no issue.</p><p>I&#039;m sure there&#039;s something in the routing I&#039;m missing, but so far, it&#039;s eluding me. I&#039;ve got several tabs open to various OpenWRT sites, one of which is the &#039;Routed AP&#039;, which is what I believe is the recipe I need to use.</p><p>Here are the config files as I have them. I think I&#039;m almost where I need to be, but there is obviously some firewall routing issues that I&#039;m not familiar with...</p><p>I&#039;ve added the configs below. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s pretty easy, but it&#039;s eluding me. Just getting to the point where I got after a few days of work... can&#039;t tell you how many times I started over because I lost access on either interface... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/config/wireless
