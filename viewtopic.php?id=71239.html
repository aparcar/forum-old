					<p>I bought a LINKSYS WRT1900ACS V2 months ago with the intent to learn OpenWrt.<br />I spent a small amount of time working out how to flash it, flashed it, and have been using it ever since.</p><p>I finally have time to spend learning OpenWrt but I just noticed that in Luci the Model is listed as &quot;WRT1200AC&quot;.</p><p>I vaguely recall taking care selecting the correct firmware because on the &quot;Linksys WRT AC Series&quot; wiki page there was no specific listing under &quot;Firmware Images&quot; for a WRT1900ACS V2, only a V1 (shelby).</p><p>Do I have the correct firmware installed? Does OpenWrt report a WRT1900ACS V2 as a WRT1200AC in Luci?</p><p>I haven&#039;t been able to find a command or a parameter to check to see if I have the correct version installed. I also can&#039;t find anything via google or these forums.</p><p>Can anyone give me a hand?<br />Thanks in advance,<br />Glen</p><p>System:<br />Hostname&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt<br />Model&nbsp; &nbsp; Linksys WRT1200AC<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-142-gb6330a1 Release (git-15.363.78009-956be55)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.18.23</p>									</div>
