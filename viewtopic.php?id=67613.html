					<p>I&#039;m recently purchased a PC Engines APU2 and put LEDE on it. The first port acts as a WAN, I&#039;ve bridged the two others as LAN.</p><p><strong>/etc/config/network</strong>:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
    option type &#039;bridge&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;

    option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth1 eth2&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;10.0.0.1&#039;

config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Behind the APU2 are two VLAN-capable switches. This works fine for the default setup. However, the ISP&#039;s set-top box (for digital TV) requires a WAN connection, and the modem has only one RJ-45 connector, so I would like to implement this with a VLAN.</p><p>I have a few questions on setting up bridges/VLANs though, since I&#039;ve only done it on non x86 hardware, which usually has a built-in hardware switch.</p><ul><li><p>Separate VLAN on the first switch. The switch port uplinking to the router also carries regular LAN traffic, so I think tagging is necessary, since that port is part of more than one VLAN?</p></li><li><p>Bridge on the router for eth0 and eth1 (the latter probably needs to be tagged). Traffic needs to exit eth0 untagged. Is this possible? Eth0 still needs to carry regular WAN traffic as well.</p></li></ul><p>Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 18 Sep 2016, 16:01)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Its not very clear the way you put it.<br />So you have one of those triple play packages (ie internet + IPTV + VOIP)?</p><p>How is the ISP set up (ie before you change anything/replace router)?<br />If you only need to pass tagged traffic from WAN to a port connected to the TV box (untagged) then it should be straight forward.<br />Let us know more about your setup (the original as installed by ISP, now what you bought/switches).</p>									</div>

					<p>This is &#039;double play&#039; for lack of a better word. The ISP usually delivers modem/router combos that do some MAC filtering (like with ebtables) to differentiate set-top box traffic from regular traffic. The traffic is not tagged (they don&#039;t do IPTV).</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to set up a tagged VLAN (testing the waters) but so far no luck. E.g. /etc/config/network has this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;guest&#039;
    option type &#039;bridge&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
    option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth1.20 eth2.20&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;10.0.1.1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>But while <strong>ip link</strong> shows the member interfaces are tagged:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># for i in eth1.20 eth2.20 br-guest; do ip -d link show $i; done
    9: eth1.20@eth1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master br-guest state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000

port    vlan ids
eth1    None
eth2    None
br-guest    None
eth1.20    None
eth2.20    None
br-lan    None</code></pre></div><p>It also looks like bridge somehow swaps the bridge names, since guest contains eth1.20 and eth2.20...</p>									</div>
