					<p>For the DHCP part, see the documentation for dnsmasq (or install ISC dhcpd, but getting dnsmasq to do what you want is probably better.)</p><p><a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html">http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/do â€¦ q-man.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/FAQ">http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/FAQ</a></p><p>The iptables stuff should work without a problem.</p><p>For the redirection script you would need Squid abd ImageMagick.&nbsp; I doubt he&#039;s running it on a router.&nbsp; He&#039;s probably got Squid running on a separate machine and he just uses iptables on the router to redirect to that.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should be able to put the iptables rule in firewall.user.&nbsp; Just change the IP addresses as necessary.</p><p>Use one or the other.&nbsp; If you want to redirect to kittenwar, use the first script.&nbsp; Then Squid and the redirect script will not be necessary.&nbsp; If you want to invert the images, use the second rule and squid etc.</p>									</div>
