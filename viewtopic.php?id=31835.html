					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m thinking about buying a router so I can put openwrt in it. </p><p>The idea is to setup the osgi framework there and take advantage of&nbsp; OSGi services that are claimed to be much faster than web services (dunno how much is true).</p><p>Would anyone suggest a router both capable of that and easy to access it and have the openwrt installed?</p><p>I&#039;ve seen in a thesis the CellPipe 7130 being used to do this, but also seen otherplace some having difficulties to access the jtag pins which would come in handy in case of any mistake done by me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Appreciate any help,<br />thanks,<br />Tiago</p>									</div>

					<p>The wiki page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a> is probably the place to start.</p><p>The most common devices talked about on the forum will probably be the best ones to go for, as you&#039;ll get the most help and support. I&#039;d suggest looking at the following:</p><p>- TP-Link TL-WR1043ND<br />- Ubiquiti RouterStation / RouterStation Pro<br />- PCEngines Alix<br />- Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH<br />- Netgear WNDR3700 (although watch out for newer versions which apparently use Broadcom chipsets - these won&#039;t work with OpenWRT)</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d consider the Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H, it&#039;s currently the most powerful router you can run OpenWrt on AFAIK. 680MHz Atheros, 128MB RAM, 32MB ROM.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, thanks it&#039;s seems a nice router yes. Could I use the usb port to expand the flash using an usb stick? Because the java class libraries may not fit there.</p><p>Netgear WNDR3700 also seems good but with half the ram, and also liked the PCEngines Alix (hmm all their devices seem to be pretty much the same).</p><p>The CellPipes seem to have good expansion of memory with the usb stick but does not happear to be supported by openwrt, however it seems that the usb stick already comes with osgi framework, which is the main objective.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you can use a USB stick to hold additional files. Something like the RouterStation Pro or Alix may be better suited if you want to avoid using USB sticks, as you could use SD / CF cards internally. Of course, you then have the hassle of building the device from its components though.</p><p>I&#039;m not familiar with CellPipes I&#039;m afraid. But I will say that I&#039;ve dabbled in non-OpenWRT embedded platforms in the past and they&#039;ve been a nightmare to work with.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, in that case it would be a possibility. But are more components needed to use those?<br />I&#039;m now seing that JamVM does not work on MIPS so Alix may be the better way, but will check more on this and make a table of who can run jvm&#039;s and which ones. </p><p>Yeah that&#039;s the fear I have from cellpipes, not many things around the web, and anyways it seems hard to find and buy.</p>									</div>

					<p>With the Alix boards you&#039;ll need to buy all of the components separately. So you&#039;ll want:</p><p>- The board itself<br />- An enclosure<br />- A power supply<br />- A CompactFlash card<br />- (Optional) A mini-PCI WiFi card<br />- (Optional) One or more wireless pigtails<br />- (Optional) One or antennas</p><p>You can buy them directly from the PC Engines website, or through a reseller. They seem to be fairly widely available in in Europe and North America, but I can&#039;t speak for other places.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>
