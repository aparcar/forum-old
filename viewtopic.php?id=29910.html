					<p>I&#039;m using a a buffalo wzr-hp-g300h to give network connectivity to an xbox and tv. For reasons I don&#039;t understand, it all works perfectly except that the tv can&#039;t see the media server.</p><p>I&#039;m hoping to side step this problem by running a media server on the router itself. Is this possible?</p><p>If it is a torrent client would complement it well as it could download content to the connected hard drive and the media server could then make it available to the tv.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>You can find a list of the available media servers here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_UPnP_AV_media_servers">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison â€¦ ia_servers</a>. I think the most relevant for OpenWrt use are MediaTomb, minidlna and ushare. The latter has several limitations I wasn&#039;t really too happy about. MediaTomb is the most full-featured but also heaviest on resources. minidlna has been written by a netgear employee to be used on Netgear&#039;s ReadyNAS line of NAS, so it&#039;s probably the best trade off if you don&#039;t have a lot of memory.</p><p>This is based on info I collected when I was thinking about deploying a uPnP AV server on my LAN but eventually gave up because of the limitation of the protocol, chose to go with Samba instead.</p>									</div>

( it&#039;s just i active download, and the rest is in queue)<br />But if this more 10 file torrent, i still make my router reboot.... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>on 13 november, My Harddisk WD MyBook Essential 3TB USB 3.0 arrive...<br />After that, i do some SMART test, the format it with 128MB for Swap and the rest Ext4...<br />Put it on My MR3220 and i type &quot;firstboot&quot;, reconfigure it and i do Whole Exroot to my WD MyBook Essential,</p><br /><p>It&#039;s Running Perfect now,&nbsp; i have test it for more than 1 day 23 hour...<br />torrent download, perfect, with more than 10 file to download, it&#039;s still runing without reboot...</p><br /><br /><p>and MiniDLNA, wow.... it&#039;s runing smooth, without &quot;MEDIAPLAY&quot; Error in My Samsung TV anymore...<br />Playing Anime for 6 six hour, i dont get MEDIAPLAY error... before... with r33288, Eko.one.pl Backfire and Barrier Breaker r34122 i still have MEDIAPLAY error... soemtimes after 30 menitus, or 1 hour....<br />I have test playing music with my Samsung TV too, it last for more than 6-12 hours....</p><br /><br /><br /><p>About TPLink N600 and N750, after my experiment above...<br />I not gonna buy it.... <br />i watch it with top, i learn, what i need is, more RAM and i think 64MB is enough...<br />of course more cpu power is needed, but only the first time i run&nbsp; MiniDLNA, it will use all my cpu power to scan my movie, music and pictures that i share with MiniDLNA...<br />Even with my PC Athlon II X2 260 with 4GB DDR2 RAM, when i run MiniDLNA and Share my 500GB Anime , 20GB Music and Pictures, it will make my PC lagging because scan&nbsp; proses by MiniDLNA.</p><p>When MiniDLNA and Transmission runing, it&#039;s need more RAM, mostly for Transmission.</p><p>Perhaps if, i have more time and not busy, i will try to change the RAM to 64MB...</p><br /><br /><br /><p>Now about Raspberry Pi, i like the Model B , it&#039;s have onboard LAN, 2 USB, 512MB RAM, 700Mhz CPU power...<br />But... in my country.... the price is arround 50 dollar to 65 dollar...<br />And the TPLink N600 is arround 65 dollar too...<br />So, for me, TPLink N600 is more attractive... it have WLAN, 4 Gigabit ethernet and 1 WAN Gigabit...<br />and 560 MHz cpu power + 128MB RAM is enough for me...&nbsp; (after saw the reslut of my experiment above)</p><br /><br /><p>About DLINK NAS, i have saw your thread in here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38193">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38193</a> <br />In my country, there is only D-Link ShareCenter DNS-320 with price arround 90 dollar to 100dollar</p><p>perhaps... i will try to get NAS, but after i googling, i found out, that TPLink make NAS to...<br />It&#039;s TPlink TL-NS210 , but the product not out yet, so i will wait for this...<br />I like TPLink, it&#039;s cheap and reliable...</p><br /><p>Here screenshot of my MR3220 and some info:</p><p>My TPLink Router 3G MR3220 + TPLink ADSL Modem + WD MyBook Essential 3TB USB
