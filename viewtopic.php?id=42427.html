					<p>Hey,</p><p>I have a Netgear WNDR3700v2 which I have being running backfire 10.03.1. But it has some wireless issues which has forced me back to the firmware from Netgear. <br />I hope some one can help me fix this problem, because I would like to go back to OpenWRT it has some function which I misses.</p><p>The problem is, that the 2.4 GHz wireless is stopping to communicate with devices connected to it. <br />- I have 4 Squeeze-box&#039;s connected to it, and often one or more can&#039;t communicate with the server and then I can reset them and they will mostly connect again. <br />- I have assigned them with static IP to be sure that it not is a ip conflict coursing the problem, but that has not made any different... <br />- I have also a mac computer which do the same, just stopping communicating<br />- But non of them indicate that they have lost the network connection</p><p>I would like to create a bug, but still find the problem some how undefined. <br />Also I&#039;m now sure how I get any useful logs out of the system for send with the log. </p><p>I hope someone here has some knowledge to help me.</p><p>-- <br />Weiser</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks okumoto,</p><p>Good info, do you or anybody know if it is possible to turn on up the debug level, maybe there is more info about why it do the disassociated frame?</p><p>I can&#039;t live with the restart loop you are using, and for me it looks like a software problem sins the problem has disappeared when I installed the netgear firmware...</p>									</div>
