					<p>I&#039;m trying to add a new module into the linux kernel of Openwrt. This module is a custom driver for my own peripheral device. The source files are located in openwrt/build_dir/target.../linux-.../compat-wireless-2016-05-13/drivers/mymodule after my patch file is applied. The mymodule.ko file can be found in the same directory. Below are my questions:</p><p>After I install the built image into my router (Atheros 93XX), I can not find mymodule.ko in /lib/modules/4.4.14/. However, (1) I can see ath9k.ko file which is also compiled from compat-wireless-2016-05-13 in that directory; (2) My .ko file works well after I scp it into the router and insmod it manually. </p><p>What I expect is that after I compile openwrt and install it into my router, I can see my module (mymodule.ko) added into /lib/module/4.4.13/ and automatically loaded when system starts. This behavior is just like the Atheros driver ath9k.</p><p>So what should I do to achieve what I want?</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe you wan use openwrt image builder and add your module in a filesytem given with arg &quot;FILES=files/&quot;</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obta â€¦ e.generate</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Standard way is best...</p><p>ponder the *.mk files in package/kernel/linux/modules/<br />choose the one that best fits your hardware category, add an entry (use existing as template) for your driver<br />link or copy your driver source to the corresponding place in kernel source<br />don&#039;t forget to select it in menuconfig</p><p>good luck</p>									</div>
