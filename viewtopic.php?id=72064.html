					<p>I have a TPLINK WR841ND v8 which got the WAN port fried in a storm, so I changed the WAN port to a LAN port successfully changing the vlan&#039;s. The WAN port got fried again and I tried to do the same procedure, but I messed up the eth0 configs and now I can&#039;t access the router. I can connect to the wifi with my password but I can&#039;t access my router to reset to the default settings. I get IP 169.254.159.178 and I had configured an IP 192.168.0.1. I did an IP scan but the only address I get is from my PC. I also tried it with the LAN ports 2,3 and 4 which are the ones that aren&#039;t fried, but I don&#039;t get a ping from any address.</p><p>Is there anything I can try to connect my router in order to reset it? Or is it already bricked?</p>									</div>

					<p>Set a static IP on your wifi card.</p><p>Try failsafe mode.&nbsp; Plug the power in and watch it boot up.&nbsp; When the power or &quot;gear&quot; LED starts blinking rapidly, press the reset button several times.&nbsp; If you were successful, the LED will blink even faster and remain blinking very fast.&nbsp; At this point the router is running with default settings, but your other settings have not been erased from the flash chip.</p><p>I have a router that was hit by lightning and none of the eth1 ports connected to the switch will move any data to the CPU.&nbsp; This is despite the green lights still lighting up when cables are plugged in.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your answer. I had already tried to set a static IP of 192.168.0.2 and&nbsp; 192.168.1.2 to my PC ang pinging to 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 from all ports, with no success. I also try to run a DHCP server from my PC and let the router get assigned an IP, as suggested in other post. I also performed a 30/30/30 reset and still no luck. Finally, I tried performing a debricking from failsafe (with the TFTP server and IP 192.168.0.66 and 192.168.1.66 as per the instructions in the wiki) from all ports even from the WAN port, but nothing worked. I guess that&#039;s because my LAN1 port is not working and the failsafe needs that port to be used.</p><p>All the lights are green, but there is something strange. The LAN1 and LAN3 port stay on even with no cable. That could be the things I messed up when handling the vlan&#039;s and the eth0 and eth1 config.</p><p>I tried it also from a Windows XP PC, and when I connect to the WAN and LAN1 port, there is no connection whatsoever, it just says cable is not connected. </p><p>I thing that the last thing I could try is the serial console, but I wanted to ask before if being able to connect to the wifi could help me solving this issue, without the console.</p>									</div>
