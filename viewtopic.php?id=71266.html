					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to ask, if someone has a repo for older packages, as I&#039;m trying to compile OpenWRT from source based on threads here on these forums.</p><p>I&#039;m looking specifically for &#039;opkg-201.tar.gz&#039;, which I am not able to find, even with Wayback Machine (I guess it&#039;s something around 2008-2010).</p><p>I was able to make several config files / Makefiles compatible with today&#039;s sources, if anyone is interested.</p><p>In my repo are all sources and I&#039;m basically trying to make it working, currently I stopped because of missing / dead links to &#039;opkg-201.tar.gz&#039;, which is required despite of unchecking &#039;opkg&#039; in menuconfig.</p><p>Another question, if possible, is it possible to bypass it? I tried to supply the script version that was close to 201, but it crashed (expected). I&#039;m bit familiar with C (just the basics), so I know a little about *.patch. If so, what do you think about patching todays opkg source code to bring it to &#039;ancient&#039; state, where it will compile?</p><p>Pre-answers for questions:<br /><strong>Why so ancient hardware? Buy a new one!</strong><br /> - Yes, makes sense, but why to throw out a device I was able to reflash with stock firmware? I&#039;m tinker and I like playing with hardware and enhancing it if I am capable to. Also, I&#039;m bringing it back to expanded life and OpenWRT is much better, than the stock.<br /> - I don&#039;t really want to spend money on new router.<br /> - Also, I have one more Fon 2200 that still waits to be repaired.</p><p><strong>No money? Get a job.</strong><br /> - I&#039;m employed and paying taxes, as most of the people do.<br /> - I want to utilize what I have, as I want to expand my networks (have 2 of them).</p><p><strong>What repos I&#039;ve used:</strong><br />See my GH for details, specifically commits. Here are notes what I&#039;ve done, what&#039;s working (and wasn&#039;t).<br />Mainly I was fixing dead URLs (the missing opkg201.tar.gz I&#039;m still unable to solve) to make it working again. I&#039;m doing compilation in virtual machine, on ancient Fedora 12 (also working).</p><p>The original repo I&#039;ve forked from is inactive now and I don&#039;t expect it will live again, but I&#039;m willing to fix what I can.<br />Original repo still exists, but because I&#039;m not able to post links, I&#039;ll send them in PM. I don&#039;t know why linking is forbidden here (or &#039;new user&#039; reason), so I cannot post them for reference, what is done and what not.</p><p>Finally, if someone has already working image for Zyxel NBG-416N, can I please ask for sharing it? I&#039;ll give a contact for me to send. Also, if anyone has Image Builder, I will be really glad, for future modifications.</p><p><em><strong>The real reason why I am asking is, that nearly all of the sources are outdated in terms &#039;newer&#039; releases and / or was not able to found anything including Wayback Machine / other sources</strong>.</em></p><p>Thanks for reply.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KosiehBarter</strong> on 18 Jun 2017, 18:17)</p>

					<p>Hello,<br />thanks for reply, but I&#039;m afraid it won&#039;t help, as the repos are limited. Current official OpenWRT forum has limited archive, which does not contain it.<br />That&#039;s the reason why I am asking, cos my work is based on unofficial &#039;build&#039;.</p><p>If I had enough experience, I would port it to latest, but I have just basic knowledge about C. I&#039;m mainly Python programmer.</p><p>Google didn&#039;t give me anything relevant, most of the results included both parts, where Google (dunno why?) considered dash as a separator. Using double quotes haven&#039;t really helped, did not find anything.</p><p>Unless, I missed something?</p><p>Or, the compiler tries to invoke (with newer package) to fix hotplug-201, any &#039;chance&#039; to bypass it? It seems that lack of source code package won&#039;t push it towards completion and I presume it will require more...</p><p>The only way I can &#039;bypass&#039; it is to uncheck hotplug2 and I am not really sure if it will work without it or not. I&#039;m currently trying without it and works, but I&#039;m really curious, what it will do in the result.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KosiehBarter</strong> on 18 Jun 2017, 20:54)</p>

					<p>Another approach:</p><p>Which of the source-code for opkg is close to the mentioned one?<br />I mean specifically which release is the closest, so the patching process is successfull.</p>									</div>
