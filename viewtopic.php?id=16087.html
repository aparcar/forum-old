					<p>Hi everyone, very briefly:</p><p>I&#039;m doing some academic research in this direction: to develop a reliable technique to remotely perform software upgrades of router boards.</p><p>Please note all the big challenges:<br />1) I assume that management can be done ONLY &quot;in-band&quot;, for example by ssh over wireless channel. So, if you bring down the wireless interface you&#039;re f*ked.<br />2) By &quot;software upgrades&quot; I mean anything: from changing a single comma in the motd to upgrading the kernel, from replacing the wireless driver to changing the file system completely.<br />3) The system has to be &quot;disaster proof&quot;. In case a change makes the board unreachable or frozen, then it automatically rollback to the latest working configuration (or a specified failback situation).</p><p>I&#039;m picking OpenWRT as environment because I already use it in my testbed scenario (see <a href="http://www.tegola.org.uk">http://www.tegola.org.uk</a>) and obviously because it&#039;s dramatically flexible and because I like it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m wondering if you have any specific pointers I should evaluate as a starting comparison, for example known approaches of other firmware platforms (inc. commercial ones)...</p><p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />mino</p>									</div>
