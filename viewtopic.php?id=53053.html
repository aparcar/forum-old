					<p>Hello, </p><p>as you may read on my other Post I´m new to OpenWrt.<br />I want to use AirPlay in my Car and bought this router an an USB Soundcard.<br />I can´t script oder anything else and I use Windows.</p><p>So I search an easy way to configure the router with Airplay enabled (and also the option so use it as 3g Router too.)<br />All I read now is that I have to load files and reassamble etc. But this is to hard for me.</p><p>Is there any Way to install Airplay in an easy way? Or maybe an easy how to, which explains also the things which has to be explained, even you know how? And it must be usable under a Windows machine....</p><p>Till now I didn´t find anything useful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, but this isn´t an answer I need.</p><p>I have this router also an USB Soundcard and don´t want to invest in an other solution on top. <br />Yes i can buy something for a lot of money. Then I have two products to insert in car...ans so on.<br />By the way my money is not endless, I have to work every Month for it.</p><p>Is it so difficult to build an Image? I Think there are more than me, which like to use this cheap solution, but don´t want or can´t build Images in this way. <br />So why there is no solution? A Software which build your image with the options you like oder just the image implemented with share play?</p><p>I can use OpenOffice and Gimp. Which is much more bigger than this and don´t need to program compile etc.<br />Should it be so difficult?</p>									</div>

					<p>Shairport is included in BB. Firstly you have to set usb audio support <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.audio">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.audio</a> and to ensure your sound card is detected.<br />Then install shairport:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg install shairport
vi /etc/config/shairport #edit the name of your airplay device and password if needed
/etc/init.d/dbus start

/etc/init.d/avahi-daemon start
/etc/init.d/avahi-daemon enable
/etc/init.d/shairport start
/etc/init.d/shairport enable</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>then if all ok then you should be able to see it in itunes or iphone<br />but i&#039;m not sure you&#039;ll have enough space on 4MB flash</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>isemionov</strong> on 15 Oct 2014, 21:07)</p>
