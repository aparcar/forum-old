					<p>Hi all</p><p>I made a startup script which runs perfect when I run it manually. Yet I want to be able to run it automatically. I have added a symlink and added it to /etc/init.d but no joy. In cmdline I would set it enabled which will make it run after a reboot.</p><p>Secondly I am using GPG to encode and upload some data during boot, but it seems that my GNUPGHOME is not working properly. Nothing is send when I run the script during boot. When I run it from crond it works fine. Anyone having experience with gpg encode/decode during boot?</p><p>kind regards<br />Steve</p>									</div>
