					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a bricked and out of warranty WPNT834 that I was ready to discard when I came across this site and the accompanying wiki.&nbsp; In the wiki page for the WPNT834 (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WPNT834">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ar/WPNT834</a>) there&#039;s some output from the boot loader and references to serial port speeds.&nbsp; I&#039;d really like to see what is happening with mine during the boot process but haven&#039;t figured out how to do that.</p><p>The board inside seems to have the capacity for a USB port as eluded to in the wiki and I&#039;m considering soldering on a connector to see if I can hook it up to my PC as a serial port and see the bootloader output.&nbsp; Am I being overly optimistic or is it that simple?</p><p>Anyway, I guess I&#039;m hoping that some helpful soul has some sage advise or meaningful guidance that might make this experiment a bit more likely to succeed.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>... Allen</p>									</div>

					<p>The boot loader &amp; kernel of your bricked device won&#039;t be able to handle the USB device on it, even if you manage to correctly solder any missing components. I couldn&#039;t find any hint of an USB device on your router in the wiki.<br />What you need is a serial console cable (if you device has a REAL serial connector, read your above link). There are cables with built in level converters for an RS-232C end on the PC, or cables with a built in serial to USB chip (usually a PL-2303) that connects to a USB port on the PC.</p>									</div>

					<p>MMCM - thanks for your input.</p><p>The reference to a USB connection that I inferred from the wiki was from the notation of the solder points labelled &quot;VCC,&nbsp; RX , TX and GND&quot;.&nbsp; These labels are in the wiki alone and not on the board itself.&nbsp; A good picture of the board showing the four solder points labelled JP1 on the board is here: <a href="http://trash.uid0.hu/openwrt/wpnt834/9.html">http://trash.uid0.hu/openwrt/wpnt834/9.html</a></p><p>The device does not have a serial port readily available that I can connect to so I think I need to add one.&nbsp; A reference in another post on this forum (http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=20236#p20236 ) mentions that the RTL8651B microcontroller has two onboard UARTS as well as a USB 1.1 host adapter.&nbsp; That post is discussing another Netgear device but it&#039;s the same microcontroller in each.</p><p>So my thought process (as faulty as it may be) is that I need to solder in a pin header at JP1 and basically connect it up by USB to my PC.</p><p>I&#039;d be happy to buy a pre-existing cable if that&#039;s what it takes but I don&#039;t see how it can connect as the only physical ports on the device are power and network ports.&nbsp; The only way that I can see to do this is through adding a pin header to that JP1 connection and wiring it up to a USB cable - although obviously my point of view is limited by my lack of subject matter expertise.</p><p>Yet, based on posts on this board and in the wiki, some people have been able to witness and capture the bootloader messages and that&#039;s what I&#039;m hoping to do.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to follow in their footsteps.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Perhaps a better question might be how did they do it?</p><p>...

					<p>MMCM,</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp; That&#039;s got me going in the right direction.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post back once I&#039;ve obtained the right gear for the serial console cable and moved this little experiment further along.</p><p>Thanks again for your time and sage advice.</p><p>...
