					<p>Dear friends,<br />I definitely have had &quot;a full success&quot; upgrading my wireless router. Now it is useless piece of metal and plastic.<br />What I&#039;ve done :<br />1. Downloaded :linux_prep_wrt54g.bin, linux_upgrade_wrt54g.bin, dd-wrt.v23_micro_generic.bin and tftp.exe<br />2. Applied inux_prep_wrt54g.bin, linux_upgrade_wrt54g.bin<br />3. I used tftp.exe for applying&nbsp; dd-wrt.v23_micro_generic.bin<br />So I had a fully operational device up and running ...<br />4. Using the web based internal software I&#039;ve made a Firmware upgrade using openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin file from your Newest section ...<br />Now I can rich my device on address 192.168.1.1 even using my web browser or telnetting but this is all<br />When I tried to choose whatever section from system console, device wants me to change password. When I tried to change the password device stopped to respond to web interface as well as to telnet, but I continue to have ping to 192.168.1.1</p><p>Please help me to recover my router !!!</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re trying to load a firmware intended for 4M of flash on a router with only 2M of flash and it&#039;s crashing when you run out of room to do even trivial things like set the password. OpenWrt is not intended for 2M devices, and if you must load OpenWrt, you should use a stripped down version like micro or you will immediately run out of space.</p>									</div>
