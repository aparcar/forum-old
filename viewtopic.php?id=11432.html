					<p>Hi, i&#039;m looking at OpenWRT and moving away from DD-WRT. Under DD-WRT i wanted to edit some scripts (ip-up for the pptp client) but as&nbsp; they exist in /tmp they are only in memory.</p><p>If i move to OpenWRT will i get a /etc/ directory like a normal linux system that is saved to flash, i have used embedded snapgear linux before but i dont want to rebuild the source just to edit scripts. Will OpenWRT be more flexible in this regard?</p><p>thanks for the advice, i look forward to becoming a OpenWRT user</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like you&#039;ll love OpenWrt.&nbsp; In short, RO (squashfs) and RW (jffs) filesystems automagically behave like you were editing a harddisk.&nbsp; Even better, the RO version of any file is still available (in /rom) as is a nice snapshot of all added/edited files (in /jffs).&nbsp; If you have 4M flash it&#039;ll seem huge compared to DD-WRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 30 Jun 2007, 05:23)</p>

					<p>OpenWrt is basically designed to look like a pc running debian.</p><p>The filesystem is a Copy-On-Write (COW) scheme, composed of two filesystems, the readonly squashfs filesystem in /rom, and the writable jffs2 filesystem on /jffs, combined into a virtual /. Any attempt to open a file with write permissions will result in the file being created or copied to the matching directory under /jffs, all transparent to the user.</p><p>More detail -&gt; <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11304">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11304</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks guys <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>i have had some issues with dd-wrt and pptp client being stuck in stone and almost unmodifiable, i want to mess around with the scripts directly.</p><p>As a development box can i bung an sd card onto my unit and get megabytes of flash, is this supported on OpenWRT? I just read:</p><p>- mount_root mounts the jffs2 partition (/jffs) and combines it with the squashfs partition (/rom) to create a new virtual root filesystem (/)</p><p>:3D i hope that means what i think it means :3)</p><p>One final thing, how easy is wifi to configure via scripts? I wish to run wireless client bridge to my lan as per my dd-wrt box.</p><p>I will need to build blueprint units at some point, but then i can go and recompile the build and create a custom image, in the meantime at least i can develop with ease!</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
