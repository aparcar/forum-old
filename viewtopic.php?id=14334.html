					<p>I don&#039;t know of anything like that, but you need to give more information.&nbsp; What protocol is used to talk from the rb532 to the other device over the serial cable?&nbsp; What protocol do you want to use to talk over the network to the rb532?</p><p>From what you have said, you could use SSH over the network to the rb532.&nbsp; In the SSH session, run minicom or something similar and type commands that get sent over the serial line.&nbsp; If this is not what you want, you will need to explain better what it is you want <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
