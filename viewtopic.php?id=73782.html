					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am running openwrt cc, and having trouble with date based firewall rules. Time based rules (without date) work fine, but as soon as I add the date, the time no longer works. The resulting iptables do not look right. See below.</p><p>firewall uci:</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;lan-00:16:3e:d2:96:cf&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;any&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src_mac &#039;00:16:3e:d2:96:cf&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option start_date &#039;2018-04-10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option stop_date &#039;2018-04-11&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option start_time &#039;20:30:00&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option stop_time &#039;20:40:00&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option utc_time &#039;0&#039;</p><p>iptables entry:</p><p># iptables -L -v | grep 00:16:3E:D2:96:CF<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 zone_wan_dest_REJECT&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MAC 00:16:3E:D2:96:CF TIME from 20:30:00 to 20:40:00 starting from 2018-04-10 01:00:00 until date 2018-04-11 01:00:00 UTC /* lan-00:16:3e:d2:96:cf */</p><br /><p>Notice the date values are followed by &quot;01:00:00&quot;. I can&#039;t seem to control these values in any way, but I suspect this is the problem.</p><p>Does anyone know what is wrong?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Duane.</p>									</div>
