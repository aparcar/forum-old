					<p>Is there an easy way of getting single link mlppp working with this firmware?</p><p>Also regarding the firewall, by default when I test any ports using shields up! at <a href="http://www.grc.com">www.grc.com</a> they all show as Closed (aka Failed test) instead of Stealth. In contrast to my WRT54G running Tomato firmware whos ports would always show as Stealth until I opened them under port forwarding. Can you explain why this is? Furthermore im unable to actually open any port, regardless of how I specify the rules. They seem clear enough to me (source wan, protocol TCP+UDP, device IP (which is static) and port, set to Accept) and yet it doesnt work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nexworks</strong> on 24 Mar 2011, 00:02)</p>

Are you using 40MHz? Any other devices nearby using the same channels?</p></blockquote></div><p>I am using 40MHZ in both 2.4 and 5ghz, the mac is limited on 2.4 to 20MHZ so i kind of ignore 2.4, with 26041 however i could achieve at least 2more mb both ways.</p><p>What I am worried about is with 5ghz, I am alone in my neighborhood I tried with all the channels and this does not improve. I am about 2 meters from the router and at the same height I am holding the laptop. Why do I get such nice speeds on upload but so bad on download?</p>									</div>
