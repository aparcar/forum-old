					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m not sure this is related to openwrt kamikaze or not, but I wanted to obtain your view on this as I&#039;m out of options.</p><p>The problem is that my dreambox 500 (a satellite receiver with ethernet port, running linux kernel 2.6.9), is unable to communicate with the Buffalo running Kamikaze (8.09, r14511). What happens is that:<br />- Buffalo running OK, all ports operational, any cable connected notebook can obtain IP address with straight or cross ethernet cable<br />- Dreambox is connected and powered off (mac address begins with 00:09)<br />- Dreambox is powered on, ethernet lights go on for 2-4 seconds, then go off completely<br />&nbsp; - During this phase, openwrt arp command recognizes the MAC address of Dreambox, then dissapears or becomes 00:00:00:00:00:00 then dissapears<br />- Dreambox ethernet lights are now off, no IP received from DHCP</p><p>If I put a dummy 10 mbps HUB between the dreambox and buffalo and give dreambox a manual IP, it&#039;s able to communicate with Buffalo, but with extremely slow connection and 80% packet loss on 32 byte ping.</p><p>I looked for:<br />- Cable problems, none<br />- DHCP problems, none<br />- ethtool settings (changes did not work)<br />- vlan settings (did not work or I could not do it)</p><p>Current settings of Buffalo:<br />~# ethtool eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Settings for eth0:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supported ports: [ MII ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supported link modes:&nbsp; &nbsp;10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supports auto-negotiation: Yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Advertised link modes:&nbsp; 1000baseT/Full<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speed: 100Mb/s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duplex: Full<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Port: Twisted Pair<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PHYAD: 30<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Transceiver: external<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Auto-negotiation: on<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Current message level: 0x000000ff (255)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Link detected: yes</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;config &#039;switch&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option &#039;vlan1&#039; &#039;0 5&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option &#039;vlan0&#039; &#039;1 2 3 4 5*&#039;</p><p>I also tried Buffalo&#039;s own firmware, it also does not work. However, if I plug the Dreambox to another ADSL router, it works! This is what makes me crazy. There&#039;s something unexplainable between the Buffalo and the Dreambox.</p><p>Thanks for any insight,</p><p>Fast</p>									</div>
