					<p><em>This is a re-post from White Russian forum, which turned read-only before i could get an answer. </em></p><p>Hello. </p><p>First <em>(re)</em>post, so please pardon my nubicity. </p><p>I got myself a TP-Link TL-WR703N and flashed it with openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory. My aim was to connect an Arduino to the router and speak with it over serial, inspired by the page <a href="http://www.thebmwz3.co.uk/article.php?story=20120611144749730">http://www.thebmwz3.co.uk/article.php?s … 1144749730</a> but i cannot get the modules for usb serial installed.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried searching for answers on this forum but have come up with nothing. The closest was this thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37214">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37214</a> but unfortunately the thread was just full of snappy answers, and in the end PeterN&#039;s router just seemed to work.</p><p>What am i doing wrong and what can i do to rectify? Are there some other packages i need to install first? Am i on the wrong kernel, ie is 3.3.8 #1 not the same as 3.3.8-1? Am i just dumb or have i ran out of karma?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@tipi:~# uname -a

I installed the new firmware, toyed around with it for a week or so, then tried installing the USB modules (and lost). I guess i&#039;m just too used to the Linux apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade cycle which tends to take care of everything. I was not even considering that this would be the issue... It&#039;s good to be shown that things are different from one&#039;s expectations at times.</p><p>Now i just need to figure out how to re-flash the WR703N without rendering it into a pretty, light blue brick.</p>									</div>

					<p>Excellent boogie. </p><p>I followed the instructions from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a> (adding just /root to the /etc/sysupgrade.conf file). The firmware can be found from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a> (the link-of-the-week is <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … pgrade.bin</a> and so the link to the md5sums file is <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/md5sums)">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … x/md5sums)</a>. There were no packages to upgrade using opkg. I installed packages tc iptables-mod-ipopt wol though i don&#039;t know why, i just followed the instrux. And much to my happy surprise, the little blue box rebooted itself and came back into life, nice and upgraded.</p><p>I could then install kmod-usb-* stuff and everything is roses.</p><p>OK, i still need to test it by plugging in an Arduino, but so far everything excellent.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good!</p><p>The problem is really not with opkg vs. apt-get, it is more that the only version running on the WR703N is still not stable: &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; is still beta, see front page <a href="https://openwrt.org">https://openwrt.org</a>/.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good point. I guess i&#039;m just too dulled to the fact that in the hobbyist embedded space, <em>everything</em> is in Beta <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>On the other hand, with an active developer/hacker/maker space like this, things actually also get fixed, and there are always somebody who can give a helping hand.</p><p>Thanks all!</p>									</div>

					<p>The fact that the OpenWRT distribution for the TL-WR703N is still beta is mainly coming from the fact that this product is quite new (it appeared only 1 year ago and only in mainland China), and got no support for open sourcing it from its manufacturer.</p><p>Moreover, the main AR9331 chip does not have a public datasheet, so all the efforts to make OpenWRT work on this device are the sole result of people working on it on their spare time using reverse-engineering.</p><p>Of course, this may look a little bit unorganized, but the results are not that bad, considered the small resources involved <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
