Only real use is to see if anything is connected to 2.4Ghz or 5.0Ghz. They either stay solid if there is absolutely no activity for 2-3 seconds, or blink insanely fast regardless of the amount of activity. </p><p>However, with LEDE/Open-WRT, you can choose any other LED to display activity and it will actually blink at different speeds like the LEDs for the 4 Ethernet ports (and how the internet light blinks at different speeds with the stock LED settings on @david&#039;s (and most other builds). </p><p>You shouldn&#039;t need to install any packages, the triggers should be there. In Luci, go to LED configuration under the System tab. You should already see an entry there for WAN activity to make the Internet light blink (led is named pca963x:Carmen:white:wan). </p><p>First, you&#039;ll want to click on add to add a new entry. You can name it whatever u want, doesn&#039;t matter. Then in the drop down for LED name, choose the LED(s) you want to display WiFi activity.&nbsp; Since I&#039;ve never used WPS in my life, I chose to use the WPS LED which can blink either white or orange. I have mine set up to blink white for 5ghz activity and orange (amber) for 2.4ghz activity.</p><p>So for the 5ghz activity, I chose pca963x: caimen:white:wps from the list of LED Names. Leave default state unchecked. For the trigger, choose netdev from the list. Then for device choose wlan0 (for 5ghz). Then for the trigger mode, select transmit and receive (you can leave link on unchecked because you have the default wifi LEDs for that). </p><p>Then for 2.4ghz activity, add another entry, select the amber wps (or whatever led you choose to use), and instead of selecting wlan0, select wlan1. Everything else same as for the 5ghz entry you created first. Save and apply and you&#039;ll actually have LEDs that blink at different speeds depending on bandwidth being used. </p><p>You should have netdev (and a bunch of other) triggers to choose from. It did used to require a kmod package back on older versions of Open-WRT to show the triggers, but the functionality has been moved elsewhere (not sure what package adds it, but I&#039;m using a WRT1200AC and @david&#039;s build, and whatever is needed is included,)8lllll</p>									</div>

					<p>Your reference is to a FOSS driver, which is not really the case here as we have to deal with a blob. At any rate, DFS was enabled in the blob, back when issue 37 was closed. You can expect issues in trying to use DFS channels, the heuristic used to detect radar errors on the side of caution, not in your favour, so false positive due to &quot;noise&quot; will be the norm, and you will be shown the exit. Would not expect some of the behaviour you are describing, but then I just don&#039;t bother going to the DFS channels.</p><p>Edit: some <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=340035#p340035">info</a></p><p>Edit: While I don&#039;t know your location, that would seem suprising, check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#5.C2.A0GHz_.28802.11a.2Fh.2Fj.2Fn.2Fac.29.5B17.5D">wikipedia</a> for high, non-DFS channels. 149-165</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Villeneuve</strong> on 6 Jan 2017, 01:48)</p>

					<p>Not using DFS channels means, that we only can use the channels 36 - 48. Channels that are used by my neighbors already.<br />If channel bonding is also set to 80MHz, all of these channels get overlapped by me.</p><p>Now I have the problem setting channels for my second WRT1900ACS, I can only choose the same range.</p><p>The 5GHz is nearly unusable without working DFS channels, sadly.</p>									</div>
