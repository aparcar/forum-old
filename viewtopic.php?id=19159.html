					<p>Following RoundSparrow&#039;s Slashdot submission &quot;<a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/02/28/200204">Contest For a Better Open-WRT Wireless Router GUI</a>&quot; and <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1144621&amp;cid=27025553">follow-up comment</a>, I&#039;m quite interested in the Planex (PCI) MZK-W04NU.</p><p>I&#039;ve been away from OpenWrt for a number of months now after moving to a desktop-based router to support my EVDO / cellular Internet connection and a few other needs (<a href="http://blogger.ziesemer.com/2008/10/ubuntu-linux-router-upgrade-project.html">details here</a>.)&nbsp; Things may have improved substantially since I last looked at this, but I always had a difficult time finding an OpenWrt-supported device that met what I think is a basic list of requirements, and is something <a href="http://blogger.ziesemer.com/2007/02/wireless-router.html">I blogged about 2 years ago</a>.</p><p>I&#039;ve been quite happy with the Linksys WRT54G / WRT54GL.&nbsp; The RF transceiver appears to have decent power and quality, at least for the price.&nbsp; It has dual-diversity antennas, and are removable by R-TNC connections.&nbsp; It includes a 4-port 10/100 Ethernet switch, and is somewhat easily powered by POE.&nbsp; However, now that I have a laptop with 802.11n built-in, it&#039;d be nice to upgrade to a wireless router/AP that supports it.&nbsp; The support for the Broadcom chipset using the b43 driver under kernel 2.6 is still listed as &quot;not production ready&quot;.</p><p>Particularly, it seems that the OpenWrt devs have long favored the Atheros chipsets over Broadcom - and it seems for good reason, especially considering how Atheros seems to be much more supportive of open source than Broadcom.&nbsp; However, the last time I looked, I had a difficult time finding any Atheros-based device that was supported by OpenWrt and had any features left to offer.</p><p>The Planex (PCI) MZK-W04NU looks like a rather promising preferred replacement.&nbsp; It has an ample 8 MB of flash, 32 MB RAM, and a USB port.&nbsp; It also has usable RP-SMA antenna connectors.&nbsp; However, according to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Hardware/Planex">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Hardware/Planex</a>, it is still not supported by a &quot;stable&quot; OpenWrt release.&nbsp; While I wouldn&#039;t mind trying the &quot;trunk&quot; version, are there any details about the &quot;LAN Ethernet switch not working&quot;?</p><p>I&#039;d also be curious about mounting options.&nbsp; There are wall-mount brackets available for the Linksys WRT54G / GL available from Linksys and others.&nbsp; I looked at PCI&#039;s web site and read through the user guide, and don&#039;t see anything about mounting options.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is already an existing forum thread on this router:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=83190">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=83190</a></p><p>I examined the case, I see no screw head style wall mounts.&nbsp; You could easily adapt the upright foot that slides to wing for screw mounting if you stuck it out from the wall in T fashion.&nbsp; It is not a particularly heavy device, so hopefully some easy options can come up.</p><p>The LAN switch is now working.&nbsp; Primarily the ath9k wireless driver is the main focus on the AP81 router platforms... a lot of good activity going on this week!</p>									</div>
