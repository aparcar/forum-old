					<p>I have a tplink archer c7 v2 i&#039;m attempting to turn into a &quot;travel AP&quot; of sorts. What i&#039;m attempting to do is have radio 1 connect to the hotel wifi and act as a wireless &gt; wired bridge on a single port on the device (wan port) which I will plug into a very small x86 machine I have pfsense on with a preconfigured site-site openvpn tunnel. </p><p>I&#039;d then like to have the lan port on the pfsense machine plugged into the lan switchports of the tplink access point which will then serve as an access point with a separate secured network on radio 2 for my own devices, as well as act as a regular switch routing through the pfsense machine for any wired traffic.</p><p>I know this must be possible with openwrt but i&#039;m very new and not entirely sure where to start? If anyone has any advice or particular documentation I can reference besides the whole of google and the wiki it&#039;d make things much easier as i&#039;ve been at it all day and haven&#039;t really gotten anywhere. Thank you for any help!</p>									</div>

The reason is the archer c7 I have along with pretty much every arm router i&#039;ve seen doesn&#039;t have the processing power to push aes-256 openvpn at a reasonable rate. I want at least 50Mbit/s of openvpn performance, and so far i&#039;ve not found anything capable of doing that. If it exists i&#039;m definitely open to using it. On the other hand, I already have a small, fanless zotac x86 machine I don&#039;t use for anything anymore that&#039;s only 5&quot; x 5&quot; and can easily push ~100Mbit/s via openvpn running pfsense.</p>									</div>

Its a zotac CI320, the new version the CI323 would actually be far superior because the cpu in it supports aes-ni for hardware crypto offloading. I suspect it will just fly. </p><p>I generally stay at the linq in las vegas and i&#039;ve seen 30mbit/s+ out of their wifi (no ethernet, otherwise this would be easy) in the past, I just said i&#039;d like to do about 50Mbit/s because that&#039;s good for the future, but I suspect if I can find an arm router that supports openwrt that could pass 30Mbit/s openvpn i&#039;d be happy to try it.</p><p>The zotac I have has an intel 3160 wifi card in it that isn&#039;t supported by pfsense/freebsd 10.3 out of the box which is really unfortunate. ipfire picked it up, but policy based routing on ipfire with openvpn is something I haven&#039;t figured out yet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>diabolic</strong> on 6 Apr 2016, 00:59)</p>

I have been considering the pcengines APU (also had alix&#039;s and wrap boards back in the day) but i&#039;m a bit reluctant to spend $200 on something so slow, at that point I may just bite the bullet and grab a netgate 2440.</p><p>For now I followed your advice and ordered this wireless card: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Qualcomm-Wireless-AR5BHB92-Dual-band-Compatible/dp/B00JESLUWQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459902457&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=AR5BHB92&amp;tag=arijaycomet-20">http://www.amazon.com/Qualcomm-Wireless â€¦ aycomet-20</a></p><p>it seems to be supported in freebsd/pfsense. Assuming it works i&#039;ll attempt to use it as the client on pfsense to connect to the hotel, and i&#039;ll use my mikrotik mAP 2n as the access point.</p>									</div>
