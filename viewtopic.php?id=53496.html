					<p>I&#039;m wondering if there are plans to support 802.11ac and hardware like Netgear R8000?</p><p>I&#039;ve seen hints in various places that OpenWRT has lost some developer momentum, and looking through lists of supported hardware I don&#039;t see many recent models.</p><p>My ISP provides support for MLPPP pair bonding on the dry loops that I have, and I&#039;d like to put some good wifi in front of two Sagemcom 2864 DSL modems. I think I could manage to put together an OpenWRT build with the features I need, but I&#039;m not up to writing drivers, etc. </p><p>Is there an unsurmountable problem getting source code from Netgear, or from the chipset manufacturers that it is using? </p><p>Are there builds of OpenWRT for Tri-Band Routers like the R8000?</p>									</div>

					<p>Broadcom doesn&#039;t release wireless driver source, so routers like the R8000 are not well supported in OpenWrt. The best-supported 802.11ac router today is the TP-Link Archer C7 v2, with Qualcom/Atheros SoC and wireless chipsets. The Zyxel NBG6716 is a similar chipset, but the experience is more limited as it is not as widely available and is a bit more expensive.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 21 Oct 2014, 06:20)</p>

In other words, they can use it, but nobody else can. Feel free to use DD-WRT, but don&#039;t hold your breath for (good) OpenWrt support.</p>									</div>
