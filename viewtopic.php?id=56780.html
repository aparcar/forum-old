					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have an issue with mine OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07.</p><p>Occurs that everytime I restart router, it creates a default route to wrong path.<br />It can be removed by issue &quot;route del -net 0.0.0.0 netmask 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.200.1&quot;.<br />I have altready tried to setup a script in order to remove it, but script does not delete route during boot, just when I manualy start it via lucy, or cli (e.g. &quot;/etc/init.d/rotas start&quot;).</p><p>Does anyone know how to resolve that?<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# route

					<p>You should put the relevant part of your script in /etc/rc.local, which is executed after boot.<br />Probably your init.d script is executed during boot BEFORE another process creates that route, so it doesn&#039;t remove any route.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sleep 1
route del -net 0.0.0.0 netmask 0.0.0.0 gw 192.168.200.1
logger -t &quot;Remove route&quot; &quot;All done&quot;
exit 0</code></pre></div><p>If the route is created by some &quot;delayed&quot; process (e.g. after a wireless interface goes up), you can try to increase the sleep time in the script. But you should also try to find out why is that route created.</p><p>... and probably you should have posted under General Discussion section <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you c2sandu, that fixed as workaround.<br />I will try to check reason this route is created, but so far could not find it on logs. Do you have any tip where I could investigate for root cause?</p><p>By the way, if an admin check this thread could you please transfer to General Discussion?</p>									</div>

					<p>Most probably, that default route was received using DHCP. I can&#039;t think of anything else that pushes a default route. So, you should check the configuration of the interface with 192.168.200.x to see if it receives IP parameters via DHCP.</p>									</div>
