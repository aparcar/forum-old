					<p>I&#039;ve been experimenting with different kind of packet capture methods for network analysis. I figured a device like an OpenWRT router might come in handy as a quick deploy method.</p><p>However, I&#039;ve noticed on Linux you need a few tweaks to get as low drops as possible (not considering the hardware, only kernel stuff). These tweaks are injecting the PF_RING module and using (the ntop adjusted) special libpcap version included in the PF_RING package. This special libpcap version makes use of the PF_RING.</p><p>I&#039;ve found a couple of hints that PF_RING was integrated in the Kernel ... great (if that&#039;s true) no need for me to cross-compile it, saves me a lot of time and effort to figure it out.<br />However, I was wondering if the included libpcap package is the default libpcap, or a modified one. If it is the original libpcap it doesn&#039;t make use of the PF_RING methods and therefore defeats it&#039;s purpose.</p><p>Can anyone tell me if the included libpcap is a modified one? And if PF_RING is actually integrated?</p>									</div>
