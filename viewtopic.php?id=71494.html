					<p>Hello,</p><p>i set up a Raspberry Pi B+ with openwrt as Client to bridge traffic incoming from Wifi to my Ethernet port.<br />I use OpenWrt DD-r48151.<br /> I only setup static IP´s on this setup and all works. But i get some ARP requests which saing</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Who has 192.1.1.40? Tell 1.1.1.1</code></pre></div><p>I never set this 1.1.1.1 IP. My pi is 192.1.1.31 on Wifi and 192.168.2.100 on Ethernet and working with relayd to bridge the traffic.</p><p>So why does my System use 1.1.1.1 as sender ip address.<br />There are also arp packeges with the right ip address 192.1.1.31 so it uses both but why and how can i stop this?</p><p>thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Short reply,</p><p>i found my Error here... I disabled dnsmasq on /etc/init.d/dnsmasq to prevent my system for setting up an dhcp server. When i enable dnsmasq the &quot;1.1.1.1&quot; Ip is changed to my wifi ip so it´s fine.</p><p>But my problem why i disabled this was that my system setup it´s own dhcp server and so completely shut down the network of my company. So is there an option to completely stop the dhcp function without stopping dnsmasq?<br />I know i can put the ignore tag into the /etc/config/dhcp but i don´t trust the system if there is still an dhcp server running.</p><p>So if someone knows how to shut down dhcp without dnsmasq it would be nice if you can tell me how.</p><p>greetings Patrick</p>									</div>

					<p>See the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp#dhcp_pools">DHCP pools</a> in DNS and DHCP configuration. You need to configure one pool for each logical interface in your /etc/config/network, and set the &#039;ignore&#039; option to &#039;1&#039;.</p>									</div>
