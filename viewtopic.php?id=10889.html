					<p>no I wasn&#039;t looking for usernames and passes, I was just going to have a php splash page that sent some imput forms (name, email, for records) to a flat text file,.</p><p>I just wanted to know if the redirect page and the page where the internet enable link are can be different</p><p>so that after their info is put into the first page, they are sent to the second, and click the link</p>									</div>

					<p>OK I see.</p><p>Well, the first page the client sees pretty much has to be the nodogsplash splash page, which is going to be served by nodogsplash&#039;s libhttpd server.&nbsp; This server is pretty simple; no php or cgi or anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s just going to pipe the splash page (by default /etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/splash.html) to the client, but with some variable substitution as documented in the README.</p><p>The most important variable there is $authtarget.&nbsp; When nodogsplash&#039;s server gets a request at the URL that is the value of $authtarget, it authenticates the client.</p><p>So what you could try is re-write splash.html so its button has a href to your separate php-enabled server, sending the value of $authtarget as an argument.&nbsp; Then write your php page to send the user to that $authtarget URL when the user has jumped through your hoops.</p><p>That might give you something like what you want...</p><p>--Paul</p>									</div>
