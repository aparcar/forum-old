					<p>Hello, we are evaluating our school implement a mesh network in the areas of library, dining room and common areas for students.<br />Currently we have centralized the management of the network with a router mikrotik which acts as the DHCP server.<br />The devices we plan to use to mount the mesh with OpenWRT are the TP-LINK TL-WDR3600 (double band). -</p><p>Based on your experience to consult them:<br />* Recommend Batman-Adv, or Batman-Experimental?<br />* It is possible that the AP&#039;s get the current network segment?<br />* Know of any similar implementation to use reference?</p><p>I await your suggestions based on their experiences.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>@valentin2208<br />Thanks for the inforamci√≥n provided. <br />I have slow to answer because I&#039;ve been trying different firmwares based on OpenWRT, including AlterMesh. <br />While I could not do what I needed, I could be installed between the LAN and the network mesh one Captive Portal for authentication and management of users (teachers and students) </p><p>Here the link of firmware used by a colleague on the forum if you need to make this type of deployment: <a href="http://www.altermundi.net/">http://www.altermundi.net/</a></p>									</div>
