					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m doing research on some freeradius stuff, but I can&#039;t quite seem to find the answer..<br />Long story short.</p><p>I&#039;ve got 2 Ubiquiti UniFi AP&#039;s, 1 FreeRadius server, and 1 mikrotik router.<br />All radius accounts have got a Login-Time attribute set (e.g. Login is allowed from 8AM till 8PM)</p><p>The unifi APs do not support CoA or Disconnect-Request packets by default, which is something I need, because the clients need to be disconnected after their login-time expires.</p><p>I&#039;d like to accomplish this by using OpenWrt.</p><p>But the wiki isn&#039;t really clear on how-to. I mean like: I&#039;ve got enough networking and linux knowledge, but I&#039;m fairly new to radius.</p><p>Could you guys tell me if this is indeed supported, and where I could find proper documentation on this.</p><p>Cheers! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>This is probably more a function of your captive portal (probably on the Mikrotik router?) than of the AP itself; don&#039;t have details of your particular use case, but the most popular reason for doing this is usually to restrict Internet access - which tends to get enforced at the router.</p><p>If instead you&#039;re using 802.1X authentication (WPA Enterprise) for your wifi connections themselves and want to forcibly disconnect those... the best way I can think of is to set a &quot;Session-Timeout&quot; of a suitable value (say, 600 seconds) on the RADIUS attributes for the user with a &quot;Termination-Action&quot; value of &quot;RADIUS-Request&quot;.&nbsp; Have just Googled it and was pleased to find a very relevant discussion on it on the Ubiquiti forums:&nbsp; <a href="https://community.ubnt.com/t5/airOS-Software-Configuration/RADIUS-Session-Timeout-amp-Termination-Action-not-working/td-p/374502">https://community.ubnt.com/t5/airOS-Sof â€¦ d-p/374502</a></p><p>So yes it&#039;s possible with OpenWRT, but there certainly isn&#039;t a requirement for OpenWRT in order to get this to work as the actual config changes need to be implemented on your RADIUS server and/or the captive portal on the Mikrotik router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m sorry, I should&#039;ve mentioned.<br />I am indeed using 802.1x.

					<p>That&#039;s the theory yes; I think the client is actually forced to re-associate, but it isn&#039;t noticable to the end user.</p><p>I&#039;ve used it successfully in the past with non-OpenWRT solutions.&nbsp; It was common in the early days with WEP, where this was the only way to force the client to re-key in order to work around some of the weakneses that had been found.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used it subsequently to ensure that users with expired accounts don&#039;t maintain wireless sessions indefinitely.</p><p>The AP is supposed to see that there&#039;s a Session Timeout, then notice that the required &quot;Termination-Action&quot; is to do &quot;RADIUS-Request.&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>atom</strong> on 4 May 2015, 10:35)</p>

					<p>On &quot;normal&quot; RADIUS (not the CoA bit which I&#039;m following with significant interest!) I&#039;ve on occasion seen &quot;invalid message authenticator&quot; if the client IP is not deemed a valid one.&nbsp; You&#039;re confident the packet is originating from 172.16.0.247, as the AP is set up to expect?&nbsp; Any chance your Debian box is multi-homed and sending it from a different IP?</p>									</div>
