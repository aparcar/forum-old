					<p>Hello.&nbsp; I have been messing with Open-WRT for about three weeks, on and off.&nbsp; My end goal is to have a router with the capability to use netem to simulate various degraded network conditions.&nbsp; DD-WRT on the Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH works well, but I can only do so much with QoS functions.&nbsp; Ideally, I would like to write specific scripts on the router and then add on to the Lua web interface to make them available in a simple manner.&nbsp; Here are the issues I have run into and I am going in circles at this point.</p><p>1. The pre-built binary of Open-WRT does not provide QoS scripts or netem.&nbsp; I cannot seem to install this functionality with &#039;opkg&#039;.</p><p>2. I downloaded the backfire source from SVN, but when I build backfire myself, there is no web interface, and the QoS stuff doesn&#039;t work like the web examples for netem show.&nbsp; Something seems different in backfire when using netem and QoS on backfire versus the the traditional uses of QoS and netem.</p><p>3. After looking through the options available by doing &#039;make menuconfig&#039; I absolutely cannot find the packages needed to build the Lua web interface.&nbsp; I cannot find them in &#039;make kernel_menuconfig&#039;.</p><p>I tried the image builder and it had the packages for Lua and QoS, but when I installed the image from the image builder, it bricked my router and I had to recover the router using the &#039;tftp&#039; install method. </p><p>I guess my question is this.&nbsp; How the heck can I get an open-WRT image that will run on my buffalo router, provide a web interface I can extend and also provide functioning QoS scripts and netem?&nbsp; I am currently stumped and I am feeling a bit on the stupid side.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the assistance.&nbsp; I went back to the documentation on the wiki and I see instructions talking about the feeds.&nbsp; The way I ended up getting to the WRT source was not through the main wiki, and I think is part of my problem on lacking this simple knowledge.&nbsp; I am updating all of the feeds at this time.&nbsp; I followed your instructions and it worked great, but now it is no longer building the sysupgrade or tftp binaries, which are the only ones I currently know how to use for updating.&nbsp; I am looking through the documentation to see how to get the build system to produce those binaries.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it is a simple matter as well.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I truly apologize for asking such basic questions.&nbsp; I read over &quot;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a>&quot;.&nbsp; I did a &#039;make distclean&#039; and a &#039;make clean&#039;.&nbsp; For a reason I am not aware of, the build is no longer creating the &quot;*squash-sysupgrade.bin&quot; and the &quot;*jffs2-sysupgrade.bin&quot; files, or the &quot;*tftp.bin&quot; files.&nbsp; The first handful of times I built Open-WRT, it produced these files and I easily used them to flash the router.&nbsp; Now, they are not building and I do not see any rhyme or reason for it.&nbsp; Can you point me to where this is documented or tell me the configuration options that will cause the build process to produce these files?&nbsp; After a make, here is my bin/ar71XX directory:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>~/Open-Wrt/backfire10.3/backfire$ ls -alh bin/ar71xx/

					<p>There are two possible reasons for disappearing images:<br />a) the images simply didn&#039;t exist &quot;back then&quot;<br />b) your image grew too big due to selected software packages which prevents model specific images from being built since their size would exceed the capabilities of the target hw</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp; It may be that the image became too big.&nbsp; However, when I moved from the trunk to the backfire branch, I selected the same options (Lua, Luci, QoS, netem) and the sysupgrade image was created.&nbsp; I may have less options in my newest build.&nbsp; I have been messing with this for so long, it is getting hazy which options I selected and which ones I haven&#039;t.&nbsp; And of course, it couldn&#039;t be that easy.&nbsp; I upgraded the router with my newest build and the router works, but I cannot log into it via the web or via ssh.&nbsp; The saga continues.&nbsp; It is starting to feel like I will never be finished with this thing..... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Thanks again for the responses.&nbsp; I am going to have tftp flash the thing again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright.&nbsp; I am a bit stumped, yet again with this thing.&nbsp; When I build from the backfire branch, I get the web interface and I have figured out what the issue was with no ssh client.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, my selected packages are nearly identical to the pre-built image available on the open WRT Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH page.</p><p>The problem at this point is when a device connects (LAN or WIFI), that device cannot reach the web.&nbsp; If I log into the router, I can ping yahoo.com from the router shell interface with no problems.&nbsp; I cannot ping from my connected device&#039;s shell.&nbsp; I can ping the router IP (192.168.1.1) from my connected device, obviously, since I can ssh into the router.&nbsp; I looked at the firewall settings and they seem just fine.&nbsp; Is there some subtle non-obvious package I am missing that will allow my devices to actually get to the web?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bduhbya</strong> on 16 Nov 2010, 22:40)</p>
