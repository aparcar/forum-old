					<p>I have searched the forum archives but so far have not found any answers to this.</p><p>I have installed ipsec and xl2tpd on openwrt (12.09 final) on a TP-Link WR842ND server.</p><p>We are currently focused on getting iOS devices connected so that they can connect to the internet through the VPN.&nbsp; (I.e. all traffic is routed).</p><p>The server is NATed behind a domestic router; in general the client device is also NATed.</p><p>We are testing with an iPad.</p><p>After a boot or soft boot (i.e. restarting ipsec and xl2tpd) on the server we are able to connect and reconnect a variable number of times (between two and ten, put one way, or for an hour or two, or even up to 24 or so, put another way), before it starts failing, after which it will always fail.</p><p>Any help / ideas with the following will be much appreciated!</p><p>It seems to be at the point of Start-Control-Connection-Request.</p><p>I&#039;ve got logging turned up to the max (AFAICT) and I have this on a successful connection:</p><p>network_thread: recv packet from 94.172.30.12, size = 74, tunnel = 0, call = 0 ref=0 refhim=0<br />get_call: allocating new tunnel for host 94.172.30.12, port 53229.<br />handle_avps: handling avp&#039;s for tunnel 61075, call 792<br />message_type_avp: message type 1 (Start-Control-Connection-Request)<br />protocol_version_avp: peer is using version 1, revision 0.<br />framing_caps_avp: supported peer frames: async sync<br />hostname_avp: peer reports hostname &#039;Ipad-3&#039;<br />assigned_tunnel_avp: using peer&#039;s tunnel 3<br />receive_window_size_avp: peer wants RWS of 4.&nbsp; Will use flow control.<br />control_finish: message type is Start-Control-Connection-Request(1). Tunnel is 3, call is 0.<br />control_finish: Peer requested tunnel 3 twice, ignoring second one.<br />build_fdset: closing down tunnel 61075<br />network_thread: recv packet from 94.172.30.12, size = 20, tunnel = 48954, call = 0 ref=0 refhim=0<br />handle_avps: handling avp&#039;s for tunnel 48954, call 57785</p><p>On a failed connection it&#039;s the same up until the last line, at which we get:</p><p>network_thread: recv packet from 94.172.30.132, size = 74, tunnel = 0, call = 0 ref=0 refhim=0</p><p>which would appear (?) to be the iPad issuing another SCCR rather than moving on to the next stage.&nbsp; NB the &quot;size = 74&quot; rather than &quot;size = 20&quot;.</p><br /><p>Versions:<br />openwrt: 12.09 final<br />ip - 3.3.0-1<br />ipsec-tools - 0.8.0-2<br />iptables - 1.4.10-4<br />iptables-mod-ipsec - 1.4.10-4<br />kmod-crypto-* - 3.3.8-1<br />kmod-ipsec - 3.3.8-1<br />xl2tpd - 1.3.1-1</p><br /><p>Configuration info: NB that &quot;ipsec auto --status&quot; reports: &quot; Either virtual_private= is not specified, or there is a syntax error in that line. &#039;left/rightsubnet=vhost:%priv&#039; will not work!&nbsp; Disallowed subnets in virtual_private= is empty. If you have private address space in internal use, it should be excluded!&quot; but I figure that&#039;s a problem I can come back to later. Although I would appreciate advice here. Given that the remote device (iPad) can connect from anywhere, I cannot predict what sort of network it will be on.</p><p>You may note that I&#039;ve got &quot;type=tunnel&quot; when most recipes for set up indicate &quot;type=transport&quot;.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think it worked at all with &quot;type=transport&quot;.</p><p># /etc/ipsec.conf - IPsec configuration file<br />version&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.0<br /># basic config borrwed from AWS setup<br />config setup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nat_traversal=yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oe=off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; protostack=netkey<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nhelpers=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interfaces=%defaultroute<br />conn L2TP-PSK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authby=secret<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pfs=no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compress=no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rekey=no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keyingtries=3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; type=tunnel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; left=%defaultroute<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; leftnexthop=%defaultroute<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leftprotoport=17/1701<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; right=%any<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rightsubnet=vhost:%no,%priv<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # rightprotoport=17/%any<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rightprotoport=17/0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; auto=add<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; # DL : from AWS setup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Apple iOS doesn&#039;t send delete notify so we need dead peer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # detection to detect vanishing clients<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dpddelay=10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dpdtimeout=10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dpdaction=clear</p><br /><p>xl2tpd.conf:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; [global]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; port = 1701<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; auth file = /etc/xl2tpd/xl2tp-secrets<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; access control = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; DL: removed ipsec saref = yes;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; DL: trying listen-addr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; listen-addr = 192.168.1.100<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; debug network = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; debug tunnel = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; debug avp = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; debug packet = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; debug state = yes</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; [lns default]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; I&#039;ve tried exclusive = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; exclusive = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ip range = 192.168.1.202-192.168.1.220<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; local ip = 192.168.1.200<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;hidden bit = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; length bit = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; name = VPNServer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ppp debug = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; require authentication = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ;unix authentication = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; refuse chap = no<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; refuse pap = yes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd</p><p>/etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; #DL: copied from amazon AWS setup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ipcp-accept-local<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ipcp-accept-remote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ms-dns 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; noccp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; auth<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; crtscts<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; idle 1800<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mtu 1280<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mru 1280<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; defaultroute<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #debug<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lock<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; proxyarp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; connect-delay 5000</p>									</div>
