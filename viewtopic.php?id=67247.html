					<p>Just wondering what people use for easy connection to a serial interface on routers for example a TP-Link TD-W9980...</p><p>I&#039;ve bought several serial to USB adaptors and wires/header pin things, soldered and de-soldered and messed up the USB adaptors so they no longer work, also awkwardly held wires on tiny connections to try and connect to GND..</p><p>I&#039;d like to know what you use, for easy connections and less awkward fiddly things!</p><p>Hope I can see what is used and eventually flash the above router successfully with OpenWRT.</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p><p>PS. Unless anyone wants to pop around and do it for me, I&#039;ll learn from the process :-) (based in UK)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Crizle</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 22:56)</p>

					<p>In many cases soldering the missing pin headers (they&#039;re usually quite cheap) to the router board would be the ideal solution, which allows you to connect and disconnect your USB-serial device (careful about the voltage levels, it&#039;s mostly 3.3 volts, but increasingly needs 1.8 volts instead) with tiny jumper wires, instead of soldering/ desoldering all the time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 23:24)</p>

Like some sort of clips etc... something that doesn&#039;t require soldering, I&#039;ve been searching but don&#039;t quite know the proper names for the things and worried about it being the wrong size etc..</p>									</div>
