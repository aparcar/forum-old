					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been using DD-WRT since a little time (at that time, was the option I found for my WNDR3800) and migrate to OpenWRT 2 days before.<br />First of all, all seems better. I have migrate for the integrated opkg for exemple and happy.</p><p>But I was hoping maybe too much <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />As the DWRT3800 seems enough power, I wanted to migrate my proxy to the routeur itself.<br />I&#039;m using a dansguardian+privoxy a lot for kid protection (so that&#039;s why dansguardian is important in my case) on a LXC container for now.</p><p>I have install privoxy successfully on OpenWRT and it&#039;s working. (can use it in browser and also with the transparent proxy rule avalaible on wiki)</p><p>But dansguardian when installed by package, there is no /etc/init.d script (this point I have soved it by making one base on privoxy and make it work)<br />Add to modify also /etc/dansguardian/dansguardian.conf to use /tmp for log. And of course proxy on 8118 for privoxy.<br />And when all seems up unless an error about transparent1x1.gif, it&#039;s not answering. Browser complain there is no answer of the proxy.<br />But I have already one config like this on my container so I don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s failing.</p><p>I find on other posts that maybe it&#039;s a problem of compilation between uclibc and licstdc++ ?<br />If I can have it working, it&#039;s easy to use for transparent proxy including for the guest network (for now, as the LXC container is inside the LAN network, redirect rule will not be easy to get working for the guest network and as a security feature seems weird to separate networks but send traffice between them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />)<br />My first question : is someone successfully using dansguardian on his OpenWRT ? (my platform is AR71xx as for Netgear WNDR3800 and has 128Mo RAM.</p><br /><p>And for now, I get my proxy external of OpenWRT in LAN, ok this is working by setting the system to use a proxy.<br />I want use a transparent proxy. There is an example on the wiki for external proxy too.<br />But I cannot get it work. When use it it&#039;s very long and sometimes (on some pages) not working at all.<br />It&#039;s this one :</p><p>config redirect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tcp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src_ip&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;!192.168.1.100<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src_dport&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.100<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3128<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DNAT</p><p>config redirect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tcp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src_dip&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.100<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3128<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SNAT</p><br /><p>So, dansguardian is on 8080. I change 3128 for 8080. But sor the second rule for exemple, I try also sending to 8118 (privoxy, as dansguardian is accepting the connection, but using privoxy for out, so when back from routeur, I think must go to privoxy to return)</p><p>Second question so : someone use this rule or some for dansguardian external proxy ? (and bonus : can it be working to use a rule for redirect guest network to the proxy in lan network ?)</p><p>Maybe you need more information or config files. Don&#039;t know what can be usefull (this when I see that system and network can be so different jobs <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />)</p><p>Thanks for reading already</p>									</div>
