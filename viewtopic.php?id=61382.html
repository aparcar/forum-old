					<p>Hello folks!</p><p>I have a scenario on my mind but not sure if it is feasible or not. I want to use a group of beaglebone blacks having TL‑WN722N wifi usb adapters installed on them. These mini-computers will be communicating with each other in a wireless fashion. I am planning to use TP‑LINK TL‑WN722N&nbsp; wifi usb adapters but I want to install OpenWRT on these adapters. TP‑LINK TL‑WN722N&nbsp; has atheros ar9271 chip. If I am not wrong there is no compatible OpenWRT image on repositories. Is it possible to create custom compilation that can run on TP‑LINK TL‑WN722N wifi adapters?</p><p>On the other hand, I dont have to use this brand of adapters. There are some other adapters that are compatible with beaglebone black such as D-Link DWA-121, D-Link DWA-125, Belkin N150, TP-Link TL-WN727N, Netgear WNA1100, Keebox W150NU, etc. Can any of these adapters be used on my purpose? </p><p>You are welcome if you recommend another combination as long as it include beaglebone black and a wifi USB adapter.</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p><p>Samet</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>samettonyali29</strong> on 7 Dec 2015, 23:33)</p>

					<p>Yes, that will work. The AR9271 is a great free software supported chipset by the ath9k_htc driver.<br />The beaglebone black also works fine with openwrt.</p>									</div>
