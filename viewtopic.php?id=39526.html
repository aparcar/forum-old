					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I would like to share with you the firmware image for the TL-WR703 in which I have been working during the last weeks.</p><p>It includes almost all the default features plus usb storage support to use it as a nas, with FTP and SFTP access, Transmission bittorrent with web interface and dynamicDNS support.</p><p>I had to remove ppp support and swap-utils to fit everything in the 4MB rom and leave the necessary free space for the jffs partition.<br />All the other default features are included.</p><p>Actually after installation you still have around 100Kb of free space, so you can install again swap-utils if you need them, or some other small packages.<br />You can also do extroot and install bigger packages in the usb drive.</p><p>I have predefined it to work in 2 different network modes which can be easily switched:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>AP mode:</strong> the ethernet port acts as a wan. Just connectet a network cable with internet access and it will be shared over a wifi network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the predefined mode after installation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The router IP address is 192.168.2.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wifi network is called &quot;OpenWrt&quot; and the psk2 password is &quot;administrator&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Client+AP mode:</strong> in this mode you can connect to an existing wifi network which acts as a wan and it is shared over the ethernet port.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this mode you can easily access the router through the ethernet port. The router IP addess is 192.168.2.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this mode you can also create an additional serving wifi network which is bridged with the lan.</p><p>There is an <strong>additional user in the system which is used for FTP/SFTP access and bittorrent web interface access.</strong><br />This secondary <strong>user is called</strong> &quot;<strong>usbdrive</strong>&quot;. You can define the password for it after the first boot.</p><p>The usb storage is mounted by default in the folder &quot;/usbdrive&quot;</p><p>The Transmission bittorrent process is configured to start only when a usb drive is connected to the router and it is stopped automatically when you disconnect the usb drive.<br />The web interface for Transmission can be accessed in this address: <a href="http://192.168.2.1:9091">http://192.168.2.1:9091</a>/&nbsp; when you are connected to the router, or in your wan address in the port 9091.</p><p>DynamicDNS is included in the firmware. You will need to enable it yourself and add your servicename, domain, user and password in the &quot;/etc/config/ddns&quot; file. Reboot the router after the changes.</p><p>There was no space left for a web interface like Luci but I have added several useful commands to control most of the features in the easiest way possible.<br />Here is the help file I have included in the router which explains all the commands I have added:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>PREDEFINED COMMANDS FOR THIS OPENWRT ROUTER:
--------------------------------------------

?                Run to show this help.

conf_wifi_ap     Run to configure the ssid name and password
                 of the serving (AP) WIFI network.
                 Encryption is always set to WPA2-PSK. Check openwrt.org
                 for instructions to set other encryption methods.

conf_wifi_client Run and follow the on-screen instructions to
                 select an available WIFI network and connect to it.
                 Command only valid in Client+AP_mode.

disable_ap_wifi  Run to disable the serving WIFI network (AP).

enable_ap_wifi   Run to enable the serving WIFI network (AP).
                 Configure the WIFI properties with: &quot;conf_wifi_ap&quot;

mode_ap          Run to configure the router in AP mode (access point).
                 Connect an internet cable in router LAN port.
                 WIFI network is created automatically.
                 Configure the WIFI properties with: &quot;conf_wifi_ap&quot;

mode_clap        Run to configure the router as Client+AP.
                 Router connects to existing wifi network
                 and shares it through the LAN port.
                 Make sure to run &quot;conf_wifi_client&quot; to select
                 the network to connect.
                 In this mode it is also possible to create
                 a serving AP WIFI network with: &quot;enable_ap_wifi&quot;
                 Configure the AP WIFI properties with: &quot;conf_wifi_ap&quot;
                 Warning: AP WIFI doesn&#039;t work unless Client WIFI is
                 succesfully connected to another serving WIFI. You can
                 use a LAN cable to access the router in this mode.

removeusb        Run before unplug the usbdrive for extract safely.
                 This command also stops the bittorrent transmission.

usbpass          Run and follow the on-screen instructions to
                 change the password for usbdrive FTP/SFTP access and
                 bittorrent web interface access (http://&lt;ip&gt;:9091).

usbspace         Run to check the free/used space in the usbdrive.



(Ctrl+C to exit this help)</code></pre></div><p>These commands are designed to make everything extremely easy for the user. For example the &quot;conf_wifi_client&quot; will show you a list with the available wifi networks and you just need to select one and input the password to connect to it. I posted more information about this script in another topic: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=178731">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=178731</a></p><p>For FTP/SFTP access I can recommend some PC and MacOS software which mounts the FTP/SFTP server as a system drive so you can use it with any application.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - For windows you can use <a href="http://www.eldos.com/sftp-net-drive/">SFTP Net Drive</a> or <a href="http://www.netdrive.net/index.html">NetDrive</a>, they are both free for single users<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - For MacOS you can use <a href="http://osxfuse.github.com">Osxfuse</a> (install it with macfuse compatibility) combined with <a href="https://github.com/pjrobertson/macfusion2/downloads">Macfusion</a> , they are also free.<br />I have also tried an iPhone/iPad app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/ifiles/id336683524?mt=8">iFiles</a> which supports FTP/SFTP and works pretty well; and some media players like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/oplayer-best-video-music-media/id344784375?mt=8">Oplayer</a> can load files from FTP servers.<br />For Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&amp;hl=en">ES File Explorer</a> has very good FTP/SFTP support. </p><br /><p>In my case I use FTP when I am at home in my LAN network because it is a bit faster than SFTP. And I use SFTP, which is safer, when I am away from home via internet (with my dynamicDNS name)</p><p>You can download the firmware bin file from here:</p><p><a href="http://db.tt/shdpF9XG">http://db.tt/shdpF9XG</a></p><p>After installing the firmware you need to <strong>access the router for the first time via telnet and set a password for the root user with &quot;passwd&quot; and for the usbdrive user with &quot;usbpass&quot;.</strong><br />Then you can close the telnet session and connect to the router with SSH (ssh only allowed with root user).<br />You can show the help at anytime by running &quot;<strong>?</strong>&quot;</p><p>As a last word I will say that I don&#039;t held any responsibility of any problems or damage you can get by using this firmware. I have been working on it and testing for several weeks but use it under your own risk.<br />I also want to remark that even though a firewall is included, it is configured to allow all the connections from both lan and wan. You will need to change the configuration yourself if you need more security.</p><p>There is no space to include more packages in the firmware file but any other improvement suggestions are welcome.</p><p>I hope you find this firmware useful and enjoy it as much as I did preparing it. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Cheers!</p><br /><p>EDIT:&nbsp; As requested by a forum member here is another version where the transmission bittorrent client has been removed and replaced by the openvpn and openvpn-easy-rsa packages. You will need to follow the instructions from the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">wiki</a> for the openvpn configuration. Here is the link for the firmware with openvpn: <a href="http://db.tt/UMWvngiJ">http://db.tt/UMWvngiJ</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>griguolcomerranas</strong> on 9 Nov 2012, 05:23)</p>

If you don&#039;t need it don&#039;t use it. And the purpose of it is not knowing the external IP, it is to be able to reach the router when you are away by using a DNS host name instead of an IP address.</p><p>If you want to know the external IP you can just run &quot;ifconfig&quot; but the address you see with this command might not be the external address. For example if you are in a hotel you will probably see a private address which is provided by the hotel main router.</p><p>Regarding the OpenVPN, may be I could include it instead of the Bittorrent client. But when I made this firmware I was not thinking in a router for traveling but in a router to be stationary at home connected to a usb hard drive that&#039;s why I included the bittorrent client and not OpenVPN..<br />Anyway, if I have time during the next week may be I can try to build a version with OpenVPN instead.</p><p>Finally, what do you mean with configuration over Wifi? You can do ssh and configure the router from any interface. Just make sure you are using the right IP address to connect to it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>griguolcomerranas</strong> on 5 Nov 2012, 03:38)</p>

On Router 1 and 2 i don&#039;t need openvpn or bittorrents or dynamicDNS, i actually installed the openvpn version of the firmware, can someone provide me with the location of every file of openvpn and dynamicDNS?
