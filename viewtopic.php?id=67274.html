					<p>Hi!</p><p>I wanted to have a custom file with config information added into the final OpenWrt image for Carambola2 at /etc. So I created the /files dir in the build root and the whole file tree inside (/etc/fw_config inside /files). I compiled the system and the config file was included. But when I recompiled the system again (without &#039;make clean&#039;, just &#039;make&#039;), the fw_config file contained double entries (the same config lines were extra added at the end of the proper ones). </p><p>So I have deleted the whole /files dir, typed &#039;make dirclean&#039; and &#039;make&#039; again, but the fw_config is still there in the final image - although it is not present in the source files (but now it contains only one set of config without the extra added doubled entries though). Can someone advise me how to make this file disappear from my system image please?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tomasz.matuska</strong> on 30 Aug 2016, 22:14)</p>
