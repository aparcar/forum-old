					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I&#039;ve decided to build image with all needed packages using image builder from trunk:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm2708/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots â€¦ 8/generic/</a></p><p>The thing is that I am not receiving an .img file<br />I only have root.ext4 file and bootcode.bin</p><p>Do you know how to combine those two files into one .img file that I will put on SD Card?<br />I found file called rpi_image_builder.sh (or something like that) and tried to run it, but it is not working properly, in the code I saw that I do not have ptgen. Do you where to get ptgen? It is not in repos for linux mint and Google is not very helpful in that case.</p><p>Could you please help?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kb06</strong> on 30 Jul 2016, 19:43)</p>

					<p>I am lame.<br />Found a solution.<br />First create FAT partition with boot configuration.<br />Second create ext4 partition and using dd create root FS.<br />That&#039;s all.</p><p>The other way is to create sd card with current version and the just dd root partition with root.ext4 created by image builder.</p>									</div>
