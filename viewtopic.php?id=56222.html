					<p>Hey Folks, </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m a recent convert from dd-wrt, and as I&#039;ve been a long-time linux bigot, I&#039;m really enjoying hacking around with it.&nbsp; I&#039;m also a noob in the forum here, so if I break protocol, please be merciful. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve got three of the routers in the subject line, and currently am trying to create a repeater bridge from one running dd-wrt connected to the cable modem, and it serves a wi-fi signal, to one in my home office, which is now running BB 14.07-rc3 ramips/generic, and to which this PC is connected via ethernet cable.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; After considerable searching in the forums, wiki and YouTube, I think I have solid config files, and I am bridged successfully, over an encrypted link between the routers (psk2+tkip+aes).&nbsp; And a scan of available wireless networks, run from a couple of Android devices, shows that the &quot;OpenWRT&quot; ssid is broadcasting.&nbsp; (I&#039;m using the same key on both routers, but different SSID&#039;s)&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;However, when I try to connect to the bridged (openWRT) router, the devices seem to get stuck in &quot;Authenticating&quot;, and never connect.&nbsp; As I&#039;m using the same key for both radio&#039;s, and the same encryption type and cipher, I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;From my searches, I&#039;ve seen some posts that suggest that&nbsp; mac80211 &quot;type&quot; doesn&#039;t support &quot;sta&quot; and &quot;ap&quot; modes at the same time, which would be required for this strategy to work.&nbsp; Other posts seems to suggest that folks have done this successfully with this model of router.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I&#039;m hoping someone can clear up the confusion for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be happy to post my config files, if someone thinks that&#039;s the problem, but didn&#039;t want to make the initial post longer than it needed to be.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The chipset must be capable of it, as the stock ASUS firmware enables it, and I&#039;ve been using it.&nbsp; But it&#039;s really unstable, and locks up every couple of days at the most, and multiple times a day at the worst.&nbsp; Since installing openWRT, my throughput to speakeasy.net is measurably faster, and it has been rock solid so far, at least as a wireless bridge.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I would also like to install openWRT on the one connected to the cable modem, but I haven&#039;t seen any documentation that tells me if I need to do any special set up on the primary router, to support the bridge connection.&nbsp; Is it just set up as a standard wireless router?&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for taking the time to read this, and for responding if you do.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cheers, </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Jeff</p>									</div>

					<p>You have realtek chip radio, right? I&#039;m atheros guy, so all I needed was to add &quot;option wds 1&quot; to wireless config on ap and sta. Mac80211 DOES support ap and sta, but maybe it only does not work on some radios (maybe realtek?). About two years ago I had asus with realtek too and I remember having some trouble. realtek support had been quite limited.</p><p>You might get some very helpful information at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">wiki</a>, I&#039;m also using <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">dumb ap recipe</a>, because I want my network fully transparent (with disabled firewall, wan bridged to lan, dhcp off, etc).</p><p>I&#039;m using many bridges around, but I use tp-links, mostly wr841n, they are very cheap, throughput is usually same as cable through a few walls and they are working perfectly. One bridge I have wr1043-wr841 over two storeys plus chamber in a concrete building and throughput is awesome, about 60-90mbit depending on the noise. Usually I cant get over 60mbit on my intel card in other room of the same flat with wr1043, so tplink routers are great :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Noz, </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s shows as a Ralink chipset on the supported hardware page.&nbsp; The switch configures by default as an rt305x, so that might be a realtek switch, I don&#039;t know. Thanks for the suggestion on the TP-Link routers.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting great throuphput, over 130Mbps, according the LuCI report, so I&#039;m happy if I can get full repeating working.&nbsp; From the posts I read, on the Wiki and forums, I&#039;m using the &#039;relayd&#039; daemon in an interface config, set to (option proto &#039;relay&#039;) to create the re-broadcast. </p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>
