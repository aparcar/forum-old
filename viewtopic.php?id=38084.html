					<p>Running OpenWRT r32651 on a TP-LINK MR3420 with a Vodafone Huawei KS4511, I did my usual failure test of wrapping the modem in aluminium foil and putting it in a metal box.&nbsp; After a few minutes the 3g-wan connection dropped as it normally does, but then the modem disappeared altogether - /dev/ttyUSB0 was no more!</p><p>I was able to recover the modem by unplugging it, and rebooting the router also gets it back, but I&#039;d like to find something less severe.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking for a &quot;usb reset&quot; capability or some way to re-enumerate the device, but I&#039;ve been unable to find anything.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks - clearly I was confused by the obscure package name :-)</p><p>I installed is from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/usbreset_1_ar71xx.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … ar71xx.ipk</a>.&nbsp; Simply typing &quot;opkg install usbreset&quot; didn&#039;t do the trick (maybe I&#039;ve got a path set up wrong) so I used &quot;wget&quot; to download the file and then &quot;opkg install usbreset_1_ar71xx.ipk&quot;.</p><p>Documentation is somewhat lacking - usbreset doesn&#039;t support &quot;-?&quot;, &quot;-h&quot; or &quot;--help&quot;, and running it without parameters simple says &quot;Usage: usbreset device-filename&quot; - so I tried &quot;usbreset /dev/usb1&quot; and got &quot;Error in ioctl: Is a directory&quot;, though it did cause the modem to restart.</p><p>After a bit of Googling I found the source code at <a href="http://projects.qi-hardware.com/index.php/p/openwrt-xburst/source/tree/release_2012-03-18/package/usbreset/src/usbreset.c">http://projects.qi-hardware.com/index.p … usbreset.c</a> which notes (in a comment) that you can also call it as &quot;usbreset /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD&quot; where BBB and DDD are the bus and device address numbers.&nbsp; You can get these from &quot;lsusb&quot;:-</p><p>Bus 001 Device 003: ID 12d1:14cc Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. <br />Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub</p><p>So the answer is &quot;usbreset&nbsp; /proc/bus/usb/001/003&quot; - and it works a treat!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kbro</strong> on 16 Jul 2012, 04:29)</p>

					<p>I spoke too soon.&nbsp; The usbreset does indeed cause the modem to reset, but that doesn&#039;t clear the problem I&#039;m having with it, which is that is reports &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; after the &quot;ATD*99***1#&quot; that I&#039;m doing to get the data link up.&nbsp; And, yes, this number normally works, especially if I reset the modem by unplugging it and plugging it back in!&nbsp; I was hoping that usbreset would have the same effect.&nbsp; Apparently not :-(</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m trying to do that, but Huawei don&#039;t seem to be particularly forward about making this sort of information available.&nbsp; In the meantime, I&#039;ve discovered that USB power is controlled by GPIO-6 on the MR3420 (and GPIO-8 on the WR703N), so I can reset the modem like this:-<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># stop the system attempting to restart the failed modem
ifdown wan
# turn off USB power
echo 0 &gt; /sys/devices/virtual/gpio/gpio6/value
# let things settle
sleep 2
# turn on USB power
echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/virtual/gpio/gpio6/value
# restart the interface
ifup wan</code></pre></div><p>Obviously this will nuke all USB devices, but that&#039;s okay because the modem is currently then only thing there.</p>									</div>
