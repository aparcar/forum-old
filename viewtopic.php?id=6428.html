					<p>Hi,</p><p>My question is in general on how to create a &quot;successfull&quot; patch for the OpenWrt.<br />Particularly, this question is related to snort</p><p>I am using a ported version of snort from the svn repository.<br />I want to add a new preprocessor.<br />For people, not familier with &quot;preprocessor&quot;, basically add new functionality through addition of a new source files and modifying existing header and make files.</p><p>I did a untar of the existing ported packages from dl directory into tmp.&nbsp; Made another copy.&nbsp; In the copy, added the new &quot;preprocessor&quot; files and changed some Makefile/header file.&nbsp; Then generated a patch using &quot;diff -ruN directory.orig directory &gt; patch&quot;.&nbsp; Now, I copied this patch file as 100-xxx.patch to the package/400-snort-xxx folder.&nbsp; when I run &quot;make clean &amp;&amp; make compile&quot; from the parent folder i.e., &quot;OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1&quot;...the compilation process stops in the middle and asks me which file to patch ? once I entered the pathname it patches correctly.&nbsp; However, I need it to create two new files in the tree, which it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; Note, there are two other patches that came with package which goes through without asking any questions.</p><p>As a work-around.&nbsp; I generated a tarball of the new sourcetree and placed it in the &quot;dl&quot; directory and adjusted the md5sum checksum in the package/400-snort-xxx/Makefile but this time while compiling my patch works fine but the patches that came with the software stops and asks question !</p><p>I know I am missing something trivial here...<br />Any help is much appreciated.</p><p>thanks,<br />Krishnan</p>									</div>

					<p>You generated your patch from the wrong directory.</p><p>The patch should look like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>--- snort.orig/src/file.c       1970-01-01 01:00:00.000000000 +0100
+++ snort/src/file.c            1970-01-01 01:00:00.000000000 +0100</code></pre></div><p>We use the command &quot;patch -p1&quot;, which means that it will ignore the first part of the path (the &quot;snort.orig/&quot; or &quot;snort/&quot;) and will attempt to find &quot;src/file.c&quot; relative to the current directory (when patch is run you&#039;ll be within the snort directory).</p>									</div>
