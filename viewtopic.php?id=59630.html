					<p>Dear forum members,</p><p>For experiments on 802.11-based long range communication we need to fix the txpower of a radio and maintain that power level over time. We use Wistron 802.11a cards, Ath5k driver, ad-hoc mode, and used with directional antenna’s for setting up links. To fix the power level at which the radio’s send, we use the command ‘iw phy phy0 set txpower fixed 2500’. During experiments, however, we saw no significant received signal strength reduction while turning the directional antenna as is expected. Is it possible that, while setting a fixed transmit power at application level, the actual transmit power still varies due to physical layer mechanisms which cannot be controlled? <br />And is there a way to retrieve the txpower of the last transmitted frame? Is that possible by means of a netlink command?<br />Looking forward to your response.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>rem011</p>									</div>

					<p>iw tool works using nl80211 interface, &quot;set txpower&quot; uses NL80211_CMD_SET_WIPHY which is mapped to the nl80211_set_wiphy.<br />Above function uses &quot;set_tx_power&quot; from &quot;struct cfg80211_ops&quot;. In case of ath5k (which is mac80211 based I believe), its &quot;bss_info_changed&quot; from &quot;struct ieee80211_ops&quot;.</p><p>How exactly bss_info_changed handled user-provided TX power its up to the driver. How accurate it is, may depend on the hardware. Check ath5k sources for more details, analyze its &quot;bss_info_changed&quot; callback.</p>									</div>
