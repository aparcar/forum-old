					<p>Hello,</p><p>i installed openssh on kamikaze 7.09. I think, nearly everything works great, but when i connect from my laptop via ssh to the Openwrt-Box,&nbsp; i get the following entries in the logfile:</p><p>logread</p><p>========<br />May 29 12:28:13 OpenWrt auth.info sshd[842]: Address 192.168.1.10 maps to localhost, but this does not map back to the address - POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!<br />May 29 12:28:13 OpenWrt auth.info sshd[842]: Accepted publickey for root from 192.168.1.10 port 49319 ssh2<br />May 29 12:31:01 OpenWrt auth.info sshd[842]: syslogin_perform_logout: logout() returned an error<br />M<br />========</p><p>I am not sure, what the first line means. Nevertheless, in /etc/hosts i have the line</p><p>192.168.1.10 PBook.</p><p>But there seems to be some problem with nameresolution.</p><p>The second line seems to be obvious to me, but what does the third line mean? What kind of error has been returned and for what reason. What should i do, to get rid of this message?</p><p>(This three lines belong to a closed ssh-session, of couse)</p><p>Thank you for all hints<br />Wolfgang</p>									</div>

					<p>There are some reasons for me to use openssh and not dropbear.</p><p>1. ssh -g -d port did not work with dropbear.<br />2. building vpntunnel with dropbear did not work. Openssh has Option -w<br />3. agent-forwarding did not work with dropbear but works with openssh (I dont know, wether i really need that or not, but i dont like private keys on the openwrt-box)<br />4. Installing dropbear + socat + openssl + openvpn did not work on my box. I run out of space.</p><p>With openssh + socat + openssl i have more functionality. </p><p>I am not sure, what the errormessage in my first post does mean and if it is related to openssh.</p><p>Wolfgang</p>									</div>
