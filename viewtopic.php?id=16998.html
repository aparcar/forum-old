					<p>Hello to all. I am a big linux fan with some experience, the last years I have been using gentoo and I love it. Now I want to create a piece of hardware that place music and stores the music. There seems to be a piece of hardware that _almost_ does the job, namely ASUS WL-HDD 2.5. The thing is that it is too old, can only accept 40 gigas (my music collection is larger <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ) and has usb 1. I tried to look at all the harware supported, but I really do prefer advice from experienced users.&nbsp; </p><p>So do I need a router plus an external drive? I would really like to stick to one piece... Ah yes, the audio output I plan to do it with a USB adapter. Thanks a lot for your suggestions!!!!</p>									</div>
