					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Greetings!</p><p>Has anyone been able to use openWRT on the Atheros DB120 board successfully?</p><p>I am facing issues with ath9k as well as ethernet interface. ath9k initialization fails with the following error during the board bootup. Also, ifconfig does not show any ethernet interface. Probably this is because openwrt does not have ethernet support yet.</p><p>Compat-wireless backport release: compat-wireless-2011-04-14<br />Backport based on wireless-testing.git master-2011-04-19<br />cfg80211: Calling CRDA to update world regulatory domain<br />usbcore: registered new interface driver usbfs<br />usbcore: registered new interface driver hub<br />cfg80211: World regulatory domain updated:<br />cfg80211:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(start_freq - end_freq @ bandwidth), (max_antenna_gain, max_eirp)<br />cfg80211:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2402000 KHz - 2472000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)<br />cfg80211:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2457000 KHz - 2482000 KHz @ 20000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)<br />cfg80211:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2474000 KHz - 2494000 KHz @ 20000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)<br />cfg80211:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(5170000 KHz - 5250000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)<br />cfg80211:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(5735000 KHz - 5835000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)<br />usbcore: registered new device driver usb<br />ath: Unable to initialize hardware; initialization status: -5<br />ath9k 0000:00:00.0: Failed to initialize device<br />ath9k: probe of 0000:00:00.0 failed with error -5</p><p>When I did some debugging I find that the error code -5 is due to the fact that the EEPROM read did not return valid data (all zeros).<br />Also, it appears that the register reads are working fine. I tried to dump the contents of the RTC registers from 0x7000 to 0x7058 and they return some valid values.</p><p>Any help or pointers will be appreciated.</p><p>Regards,<br />-Rafiq.</p>									</div>
