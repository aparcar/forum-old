					<p>I installed Kamikaze 8.xx on my Fonera. I downloaded the snapshot of 10-15-2008.<br />I installed openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs, even if (1) I would like to understand what is the difference among the variety of file systems. What is the difference between openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs, openwrt-atheros-ubnt3-squashfs and openwrt-atheros-ubnt5-squashfs?</p><p>I made it work:<br />After installing Openwrt through Redboot,<br />I connected through the Ethernet and de DHCP gave my PC a 192.168.x.xxx IP.<br />I connected to 192.168.1.1 and Luci popped up.<br />I logged in with pwd admin and I changed the password.<br />I configured the WIFI editing the setting of the pre-configured interface</p><p>If I connected the Fonera to my modem/router, I cannot see the Fonera from my router interface (it is a 2wire that detected the connected devices)<br />If I connect to the fonera WIFI, my PC get an IP from the 2wire. I could not connect to the Luci interface ... what is it&#039;s address?<br />I think this happens because the bridged connection.</p><p>I tried to disable the &quot;bridged&quot; checkbox in the lan interface configuration. It didn&#039;t work<br />I tried to create a &quot;wan&quot; interface with DHCP associated with eth0 through Luci but then I could not access anymore to the Fonera and the internet... I had to reflash it. </p><p>I am not an expert of devices, interfaces, zones, their relationships and firewall configuration. I am pretty a novice at it. Actually if you can tell me (2) Where I can find a tutorial that easily explains how they works I would be happy.</p><p>(3) <br />a) I would like that my Fonera could get a DHCP address from the router for the wan address and has a 192.168.1.xxx address for the devices that connect through the wireless.<br />b) I would like to be able to easily set the rules that redirect FTP, VNC and other ports to a computer<br />c) it would be good if I can set a static IP based on the MAC address on the computer so it would be easy to set the rules). <br />d) I would also like to have QoS that guarantees me that the calls I make through Skype, MSN messanger and a SIP phone are not broken. I was able to install luci-qos and the qos scripts but I don&#039;t know what the SIP ports are even because I think that there is a range that need to be to set. Having an interface like the one of DD-Wrt would be nice (you have only to select SIP protocol and associate a priority).</p><p>Can you help me with (1), (2) and (3) ?</p><p>-Cris</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Cris</strong> on 21 Oct 2008, 00:56)</p>
