					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>There is already a link from the Wiki to this post! So, let me give you an update on what&#039;s happening. First of all, I&#039;ve provided a preliminary release of the PBX package here:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32392</a></p><p>Also, the PBX interface has been accepted into LuCI, and is already available in Backfire&#039;s SVN trunk, so you can build it using the SVN repository already. It will eventually make its way into&nbsp; a release and will become available as a package.</p><p>Here is the original text of the original post:</p><p>I decided to throw together a set of screenshots of the LuCI-based Asterisk front-end that I&#039;ve been working on for OpenWRT, so I can get your reaction and suggestions for improvements.</p><p>Please take a look here, and reply to this thread with any ideas that you have for missing features:</p><p><a href="http://dancho.no-ip.com/pbx.html">http://dancho.no-ip.com/pbx.html</a></p><p>Also, please do take a look at the list of features that I would like to implement for the interface here, so you don&#039;t post suggestions I&#039;ve already thought about:</p><p><a href="http://dancho.no-ip.com/pbx_todo.html">http://dancho.no-ip.com/pbx_todo.html</a></p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dancho</strong> on 2 Nov 2011, 06:01)</p>

As long as you have a huge community, and only minor commercial contributors, there is really no big difference to the GPL regarding to the result. Future development will remain open and free, and only little modules or side projects may be done closed. No big deal.</p><p>BUT if it is the other way around, one huge commercial contributor and independent contributors only in small portions, that is imo a problem, because the huge commercial contributor could any day decide to do the further development closed and the rest would be left stranded with a half-done product/software. Yes, with enough manpower you could do a fork, and go on, but without, and if time is of the essence, the commercial contributor would gain a major advantage on the market. Also, the bad guy, could take your new code (if under the same &quot;free&quot; license) and re-use it, but not the other way around. Now he payed for most of the development anyway, but he payed neither for testing and debugging nor for further ideas from the community nor for the publicity.</p><p>Hm, didn&#039;t such a maneuver lead to the invention of the GPL?</p><p>With at least the libraries under the LGPL, such maneuvers are less likely.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>dancho wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>This mechanism is precisely what allowed us to have OpenWrt in the first place.

Think your options through, and make a decision!</p><p>The License can be a necessity (be able to sell a product, or prevent others from doing exactly that), a strategic thing (libraries under LGPL or even GPL to strengthen the standing point of &quot;free software&quot; (in the sense of keeping it free, see LibreOffice (LPGL) vs. OpenOffice (Apache License))) or it can even simply be a statement.</p><p>Like if I put some tiny little program under GPL, probably nobody is gona give a fuck, and reuse code in proprietary programs, and I would never notice it. So the actual license would not make any real difference in the result. But it would still be a statement as: &quot;I want code to remain free &quot; or &quot;One more program under GPL&quot; etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Dancho</p><p>Had a look and so far very impressive. I am currently using the FIVN16 interface modified to work on Asterisk 1.8.4.4-1 and based on my experience the following features will be of value:<br />a) viewing and filtering the call logs, based on some simple criteria as destination, time etc<br />b) similarly viewing and maybe filtering the system logs.<br />c) dialplan customization to allow for a call to ring at a sequence of extensions before possibly going to voicemail or unanswered<br />d) support for integration of ATA devices such as Linksys 3102, maybe leveraging the wizard at <a href="http://voxilla.com/voxilla/tools/device-configuration-wizard/linksys-spa3102-spa3000-configuration-wizard-for-asterisk">http://voxilla.com/voxilla/tools/device … r-asterisk</a></p>									</div>
