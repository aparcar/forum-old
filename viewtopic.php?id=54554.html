					<p>This happens on some models due to the software not fully complying with how the hardware is built.&nbsp; The final step of a reboot is accomplished through hardware forcing a full hardware reset.&nbsp; This is usually accomplished by the manufacturer having connected one of the GPIO pins to the reset input of the CPU.&nbsp; Exactly which pin does this is at the manufacturer&#039;s discretion, and they&#039;re not all the same.&nbsp; So if the software developers have not identified the proper pin and written it into the code, it will not reset.</p><p>Suggest trying a trunk image to see if the issue has been addressed since BB was released, if not you could file a bug report.</p>									</div>
