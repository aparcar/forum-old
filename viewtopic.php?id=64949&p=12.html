					<p>Hey David, just a quick question...</p><p>When I have upgraded LEDE to a newer build, I have wiped the settings of LEDE, booted into the Linksys partition (via the uboot command, or something like it), and flashed a new LEDE image. My question is that can I keep my LEDE settings after flashing a new build, while keeping my other Linksys partition intact? (I don&#039;t know if the sysupgrade procedure would wipe the other partition, and if flashing a LEDE image would wipe my settings, and I would like to have that partition just in case something happens with my configuration)</p><p>Thanks for all the builds and help!</p><p>--ThePatrikos</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey guys,<br />From what I see, I guess that it doesn&#039;t behave like I upgraded with ddwrt (I could flash a newer build, and my settings would be intact. Whether the thing would boot up was another story...) I&#039;m thinking that this has to do with the fact openwrt/LEDE saves config differently than dd-wrt. I&#039;ll make a backup and hope that restoring it works next time I upgrade... (I also do have a refurbished 1900acv1)</p><p>P.S: I just wanted to say thanks to @bill1228, your ddwrt forum posts got me switching to LEDE (IMO, it&#039;s better than dd-wrt)</p>									</div>

					<p>depending on the printer, it may only be wifi &quot;g&quot; and will likely need 20mhz. So make sure your 2.4 band is setup to allow these &quot;legacy&quot; type connections. I know my HP at home is pretty lame like this.....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cybrnook2002</strong> on 5 Oct 2016, 19:14)</p>
