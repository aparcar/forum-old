					<p>I&#039;m one of the guys that say &quot;it doesn&#039;t make any sense&quot; - and here&#039;s a hint on how to solve your problem with cross-compiling:<br />run make twice. once with the host compiler settings only for those targets that need to be executed on the host at compile time, then run another make process for all the other binaries with the cross compiling settings. <br />There are several other packages that need this, so it&#039;s been done before...</p>									</div>

					<p>Of course it will solve most of the configure problems - because ./configure will run it it&#039;s true environment, and therefore, it will be able to guess the values correctly.</p><p>I already have samba 3.0.21b compiled with options allowing it to be a true domain controller (LDAP support, ACL support, etc.), and workarounds for problems like lack of NSS in uClibc (Samba needs to resolve system users, and uClibc can&#039;t fetch system users from LDAP, only from /etc/passwd + /etc/group).</p><p>I also have a kernel compiled with acl + xattr support (actually, ext2/ext3 filesystems), and OpenLDAP (2.3.19) server, too.</p><p>For those interested in Unattended installations (<a href="http://unattended.sf.net">http://unattended.sf.net</a>) - it also supports PXE booting via a tftp server, for unattended installations.</p><p>So, on ASUS wl-500g (or any other compatibile router to which you can connect a usb stick or a HDD), you can have a compact, but fully functional domain controller for a small office.</p><p>With two Windows clients connected, it has even about 15 megs of RAM free.</p><p>The only thing that is broken in Samba is smbclient - it&#039;s needed for cupsaddsmb for easy printer management:</p><p>[2006/02/10 11:36:06, 0] smbd/reply.c:reply_write_and_X(3048)<br />&nbsp; reply_write_and_X - large offset (40bd &lt;&lt; 32) used and we don&#039;t support 64 bit offsets. </p><p>Every uploaded file (via smbclient, locally) is cut to 16573 bytes, which is &quot;the first network chunk transmitted from smbclient to the server&quot;.</p><p>If anyone&#039;s interested - let me know - I don&#039;t really know if running a Samba domain controller on a OpenWRT-compatibile router is the main interest of OpenWRT developers.</p><p>And of course - if anyone can resolve the smbclient problem - is welcome.</p>									</div>

					<p>The main reason why I&#039;m opposed to native compilation of packages is that it cannot be reproduced by others without setting up lots of stuff.<br />Compiling a package natively may give us a working binary, but it produces nothing that can be maintained properly.<br />Sure, it&#039;s more work to cross-compile an application with a broken configure script... but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not worth doing it...</p>									</div>

To compile package for openwrt environment, I just installed the uclibc package in debian and make a few symlink change on openwrt.

					<p>a very similar to chimpanzee solution is to setup scratchbox with openwrt<br />using what they called cputransparency mechanism to automatically dialog between the<br />router and the host-pc (sbrsh for sbox remote shell) with nfs mount.So one can almost fake native compilation more efficiently (configure works then with true native router,and compile with crosscompilation in jailed nfs_root !).<br /> for info :<br /><a href="http://scratchbox.org/wiki/CrossToolToolchain">http://scratchbox.org/wiki/CrossToolToolchain</a></p>									</div>
