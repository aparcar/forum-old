					<p>Hello all,</p><p>as I&#039;m trying to get some hardware working that is only supported under Linux 2.6, I was glad to see that Kamikaze 7.07 got to the point of rebooting my WL-HDD (and not every 2 seconds, like earlier versions did <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Now I try to get the USB running, but it refuses. When I install the usb-packages and do<br />insmod usbcore<br />insmod ohci-hcd<br />I only get (from &#039;dmesg&#039;)</p><p> usbcore: registered new interface driver usbfs<br /> usbcore: registered new interface driver hub<br /> usbcore: registered new device driver usb<br /> ohci_hcd: 2006 August 04 USB 1.1 &#039;Open&#039; Host Controller (OHCI) Driver</p><p>But no recognition of the USB-ports. So I thought that it&#039;ll take some time to get the cp2101-driver running, but I&#039;m stuck even before that! Does anybody have a WL-HDD and runs it successfully with Kamikaze 7.07, linux 2.6 and uses USB?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Ineiti</p>									</div>

					<p>*sigh* I have to admit I&#039;m slowly descending into madness regarding the WL-HDD. I dug mine out today, confident that it would work now with 2.6 right away.</p><p>Well, it doesn&#039;t. I have tried..<br />- a self-compiled image<br />- <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm47xx-2.6/openwrt-brcm47xx-2.6-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7 â€¦ uashfs.trx</a><br />- the same for 7.07<br />- various other .bin files, like openwrt-wrt54g-2.6-squashfs.bin with the extra headers removed</p><p>None of these work, with the single exception of openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx.</p><p>Could somebody who has a 2.6 kernel running on her or his WL-HDD please tell me the exact steps that were required?<br />It would probably be best if someone could also send me an image (TRX) that is known to work.</p><p>I&#039;m getting the impression that somehow I have messed up the NVRAM and the 2.6 kernel chokes on some setting in there.. but thats only speculation until I have tried an image which does work on another WL-HDD.. so I would be eternally grateful if somebody could help me with this.</p><p>Yours, Florian</p>									</div>

					<p>Hm.. that is something. So you took the 7.09 TRX file from the Downloads section? Could you do me a big favor and send me an<br />NVRAM dump from your WL-HDD? My email address is: floe butterbrot org (insert punctiation as needed ;-).</p><p>Thanks a lot, Yours, Florian</p>									</div>
