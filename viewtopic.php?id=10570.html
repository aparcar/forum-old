					<p>I have been doing some more research and it looks like the Asus WL-500gP has a faster processor (264Mhz) (vs the 200 Mhz in the Linksys WRT54GL).&nbsp; So I suspect the Asus WL-500 will likely be better for VPN.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices</a></p>									</div>

					<p>if your planning to do vpn, and the device you have in mind can&#039;t do it with it&#039;s cpu, i&#039;d recommend getting a more powerful device rather then comromizing on features by using the stock firmware.&nbsp; I think via makes fanless 1-2ghz boards x86 now for example, which would obviously handle anything you wanted to throw at it (and seem to have supported hardware crypto, actually, not that you need to push vpn data at 20gbps). or one of the higher end embedded boards (routerboard, soekris, wrap, etc) designed for this sort of thing, which would be cheaper.</p><p>as to whether these consumer devices can do it without hardware accelleration, i&#039;ve never tried, but I don&#039;t suspect you&#039;d have much problem with a small number of clients, on a normal internet connection.&nbsp; someone else will no doubt chime in with their experiences on this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been running OpenVPN on Linksys WRT54GS v.1.1 for quite some time now.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have any problem saturating my 768 kbit uplink at either end of the VPN tunnel.&nbsp; &nbsp;While doing so the cpu usage for OpenVPN is steady at 17.8%&nbsp; This is on WhiteRussian RC5.&nbsp; </p><p>Depending on you network speed that the VPN is on just about any hardware that OpenVPN runs on should handle your VPN just fine.&nbsp; Number of clients is not much a factor, the bandwidth that must be encrypted is the biggest factor of CPU usage.</p>									</div>
