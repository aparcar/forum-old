					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am trying to build an custom OpenWrt image for an IPQ8064 based equipment.<br />The equipment in question has two WiFi modules, one QCA9888 and one QCA6174, which are detected and work in my image.<br />However, the custom image misses the detection of another device, which should support another WiFi 802.11ad 60GHz (Wilocity 6210) module.</p><p>Using the command lspci on my custom image I got the following devices:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# lspci
0000:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Airgo Networks, Inc. Device 0101
0000:01:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA986x/988x 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter
0001:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Airgo Networks, Inc. Device 0101
0001:01:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 32)</code></pre></div><p>However, it misses the detection of another device, with the following details:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Bus Bridge - Device: 0x0101  Vendor: 0x17cb (same as the other PCI bridge detected)
PCI device - Device: 0x0310 Vendor: 0x1ae9 (Wilocity 6210)</code></pre></div><p>The module is not fault, as it works perfectly with the OEM image and U-Boot pci command list it correctly.<br />The problem seems to be related only with the correct detection by the Linux Kernel boot process. I don&#039;t see any errors on the bootlog related with the PCIe detection.</p><p>I have already tried with the following linux kernel versions:<br />- 3.18.29<br />- 4.1.23<br />- 4.4.7<br />All of them have the same behavior. According to the <a href="http://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/WLAN.html">http://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/WLAN.html</a>, the device is supported by these kernel versions.</p><p>Could this happen due to a bad include of the Wilocity firmware? Although I&#039;ve included the firmware in my image (files wil6210.brd and wil6210.fw in /lib/firmware), I am not entirely sure if kernel is loading correctly this files or at the right time. I have confirmed that they are required by the wil6210 driver and that the names are correct; since the device is not enumerated in boot (or after with rescan), loading the driver does nothing (no output) as it does not have a device to talk.</p><p>Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.<br />Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sjuliao</strong> on 15 Aug 2016, 20:34)</p>

					<p>Problem solved.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Sorry, I am working on a different device produced directly by Qualcomm.<br />I did take a quick look at the specs from your device and did notice some differences between your hardware and mine, although general functionality is very similar. But I couldn&#039;t find if the WiFi modules used on your hardware are the same as mine for example...</p><p>Did you get access to the datasheets (product and each WiFi device for example)?<br />If yes, try to discover a very similar product supported by OpenWrt and base your development on the device tree files from that product; if possible, this method should allow you to develop faster.</p><p>Since my work and all the related documentation to which I do have access for my case is protected under NDA, I cannot share sensible information. <br />But I can try to help you on other ways, if I know how to.</p><p>Kind regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sjuliao</strong> on 28 Aug 2016, 13:37)</p>

					<p>Okay I&#039;ve found what I was looking for on wikidevi under the name TP-LINK_AD7200_(Talon).</p><p>The WiFi modules are different from mine. I suppose that the PCIe base address to access them, as well as a lot of others are different from mine.</p><p>But I maintain my suggestion: try too check if TP-Link has already produced a previous product parcially based on the mainboard and processor that this uses.<br />If yes, that gives you a good start point; if not you will need to start from scratch.<br />Since the product is very recent on market, I am not entirely sure if someone has already done some development to it...but try to find that before you coding, it can save you lots of hours and pain.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks you sjuliao, i Will follow your idea. <br />I don&#039;t have access to datasheet. I&#039;m just using the GPL source code from TP LINK website. Up to now, gpios are not well mapped. Pcie devices are well discovered. Some wireless drivers are missing like wil6210 and others have errors.</p>									</div>
