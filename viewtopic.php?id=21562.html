					<p>Hey guys!</p><p>Today my brandnew WRT160NL arrived and the first thing I did was changing the firmware to OpenWRT. It&#039;s been a while using this firmware, on my WRT54GS I used dd-wrt.</p><p>I want to use my new router as a simple repeater for a dlink router with WEP encryption for now until our new cable provider switches us on. For this I have to change the stock firmware to something else, so I came back to OpenWRT because it&#039;s the only 3rd party firmware available for it right now.</p><p>So I downloaded &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-wrt160nl-squashfs.bin&nbsp; &nbsp; 28-Aug-2009 00:26&quot; from here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a> and got at least the basic system up and running, but without a working webif and no wifi-support (no wlan0 interface showing up).</p><p>In the forums I read somehing about that I have to build my own firmware on a buildsystem, but I gues that&#039;s a bit too much for me. Can someone provide me a ready-to-go build of the newest trunk version with wifi and maybe a webif?</p><p>This woud be great, I appreciate your help in advance!</p><p>So long,<br />BlackWizard</p>									</div>

					<p>I also had read the exploitation thread front to back numerous times trying to piece it together and this is also where I am stuck. No where in that thread do they direct to a howto or anything on build yourself.</p><p>I am fully willing and capable of getting this done in terms of complexity and willingness to work at it, but without having details on the process I am up in the air.</p><p>While it seems like there are some good and active members in this community it does not seem as welcoming as some others. Also by active I mean they get things done, but for themselves and rarely go about finishing documentation. Such as with the WRT160NL the information spread about and the incomplete docs can make an newcomer see easy opportunity, but then are stuck with the reality that they need to start new.</p><p>Anyways I am going to try and learn this whole system of building images and such and will update you if I get anything together.</p>									</div>

					<p>Haha, vincentfox I caught your reply and read it then refreshed and noticed a slight* change... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Mainly what I was stating is that I am very energetic with projects I involve myself with and with my background in support documentation I have a desire for details that are for the lowest denom. Where it came in wasn&#039;t exactly just this hardware, but the OpenWRT references such as &quot;build&quot; or &quot;compile&quot; an &quot;image&quot; with the &quot;profile&quot; to get it to work. Well little was said that you need a development environment using something like VMWare with an OS like Ubuntu that contains the parts (packages) to &quot;make&quot; an image.</p><p>I know how to do it now and am playing and will be making suggestions, but I just thought if the image building with the profile is a required step to get wifi then maybe some links to howto&#039;s could have been made.</p><p>I&#039;m good now though and really my &quot;some good and active members&quot; line referred to you for this project mainly.</p><p>As a side note I found a foreign thread about the wrt160nl and wifi that I may make reference after I sort out some of the translation.</p><p>Sry fox if any offense was made...</p>									</div>
