					<p>so 3 days ago i bought a tp-link tl-wr940n v3 which is the same as the 941nd v6 but with fixed antennas. so as i always with new routers i tried to install openwrt on it (this image <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr941nd-v6-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … actory.bin</a> )</p><p>and it didn&#039;t boot up after and after some research i discovered that only the&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; version is supported in CC 15.05<br />and i also found this image <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr941nd-v6-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … actory.bin</a> in the trunk releases which&nbsp; works but it dont have Luci in it. i tried to install it using the offline installation method but i ran out of&nbsp; space in the middle of it. so i tried to build my own image but the profile &quot;TLWR941&quot;&nbsp; generates an image for the Chinese version</p><p>so my question is how do i build an image like the one in the trunk ???</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, tired. So you tried the image generator from trunk, with an image for the TL-WR941ND, and that doesn&#039;t work, but a precompiled trunk image does?</p>									</div>

					<p>15.05-15.05.1 includes only chinese version, download ImageBuilder from TRUNK and build your image with profile TLWR941. There will be several images, among them 941nd-v6-CN and 941nd-v6. Second image is compatible with international model. I flashed my international 941nd-v6 few days ago, don&#039;t think it&#039;s dissapeared from trunk. Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>I will try not to open a new thread and post my question here.</p><p>So I have TPWR940ND v3 router (similar to TPWR941N). I was not aware of a difference between international and Chinese version so I &#039;bricked&#039; my router with image build from CC15.05.1 version. After the research I found out, that I have to build my own image from trunk and so I did.<br />Here is an output from doing so: <a href="http://pastebin.com/0maWTG5U">http://pastebin.com/0maWTG5U</a></p><p>I chose to get my router back to default (with default image) and from there upload an DD image (designated driver - trunk). The process was successful, but I still have some problems. One of them, pops up immediately and that - I can not access webUI, also router does not respond on ping.<br />Before I go on, here is an output of uploading file /flashing to OpenWrt DD: <a href="http://pastebin.com/jhFyMtvm">http://pastebin.com/jhFyMtvm</a></p><p>With my little knowledge I start to investigate things. And I found out that I can not telnet nor SSH to my router.<br />Check netstat, and router is listening on port 22 (so theoretically SSH could be possible). Further investigation shows up, that there is no file at /etc/config/network, which is (I believe) the default network configuration file.<br />Another thing I tried is access router via serial. That works only if I go to FailSafe mode. Later login is not possible.<br />The serial output of investigation could be found here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/YiaAm5CC">http://pastebin.com/YiaAm5CC</a></p><p>If anyone interested in helping me need more information I could deliver anytime.</p>									</div>
