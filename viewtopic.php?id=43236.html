					<p>Hi,</p><p>I just got a WAG54G (ADSL+Ethernet+WiFi), and I can see that the WiFi card is mini-PCI type IIIB. Has anyone played with these before me to any significant extent?</p><p>Specifically, I want to replace the WiFi card with a USB card, but the selection is limited. I have found three similar cards:</p><p><a href="http://www.interfacemasters.com/products/im800.html">http://www.interfacemasters.com/products/im800.html</a><br />(buy it page leads to a 404, not good)</p><p><a href="http://www.voxtechnologies.com/embedded-solutions/compact-pci/per-c20u">http://www.voxtechnologies.com/embedded … i/per-c20u</a><br />(not sure if the power supply means it provides 5V on USB, or whether it requires a 5V input)</p><p><a href="http://www.ceedtec.com/mini-pci-dual-usb-2-0-host-i-f-board.html">http://www.ceedtec.com/mini-pci-dual-us … board.html</a><br />(seems to require a 5V input)</p><p>All of these are type IIIA, which are slightly longer than the type IIIB used by the WiFi module in the WAG54G. To make them fit, I&#039;d have to remove the 5-pin JP3 connector (What is it for? Is this the serial console?) or replace it with a L shaped connector.</p><p>The 5V DC input requirements are a little disappointing, but not insurmountable - I could just solder this onto the bottom of the 12V DC input connector:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Car-Power-Converter-Display-Supply/dp/B008VORADW">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Car-Power-Conve … B008VORADW</a></p><p>The idea is that instead of having just mini PCI WiFi, it would have full USB expansion capability (can just put a small USB hub inside the casing for extra ports) and have WiFi, disk, or anything else connected to it.</p><p>Has anyone done anything like this before? While people have hacked WRT54Gs to a substantial extent, the WAG54G doesn&#039;t seem to have had that much attention.</p>									</div>

					<p>Although phisically the connector is a mini-PCI the signals are for the TI <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLYNQ">VLYNQ</a> bus. The TNETD7200 and 7300 haven&#039;t PCI bus as far i know.</p>									</div>
