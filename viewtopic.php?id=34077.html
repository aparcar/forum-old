					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m new in Openwrt, and i&#039;m working with backfire 10.03.1.<br />I was reading some posts in this forum (very good forum in my opinion with a lot of good thoughts and ideas), and i notice than some use Kamikaze version of openwrt, other trunk version, and other backfire. Seems to me that Backfire 10.03.1 is the current stable branch, and that trunk is the developer branch, and kamikaze and whiterrussian...?</p><p>For me, that are seeing this for the first time that seems a little confuse, so I start with backfire, and may someone give some tips, about the more stable and better to use with Ralink RT3572 802.11a/b/g/n USB Single Chip with a Ubuntu x86 linux machine. And if support this Ralink chip?</p><p>Thanks in advanced<br />Kisses to all,<br />Jenifer</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe that whiterussian was the old version before backfire</p><p>backfire is the &#039;stable&#039; branch, but is getting pretty old and so does not support a lot of current stuff.</p><p>kamikaze is another name for trunk, which is the current development branch, which is what many people are using because it supports the more current stuff.</p><p>I would start by looking your router up in the hardware compatibility table and see what version it says is needed to support that router. anything newer than that should work.</p><p>If you are working to support a new router, you should we working on the trunk development branch.</p>									</div>
