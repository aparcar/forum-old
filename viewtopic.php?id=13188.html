					<p>Greetings all!</p><p>New to the forum so excuse me if not writing to the right part of the forum.</p><p>I have a question you might be able to help with:</p><p>Have a Linksys WRT54-GL 1.1 router and trying to increase range/transmiting power of wireless. With original firmware that&#039;s not possible, so I already tried multiple opensource fw-s like Tomato, DD-WRT,... but they all made my router unstable. So the other day I installed this one:</p><p>Firmware Version WHITE RUSSIAN (0.9) <br />Kernel Version Linux version 2.4.30 (nbd@ds10) (gcc version 3.4.4 (OpenWrt-1.0)) #1 Sat Feb 3 13:16:08 CET 2007 </p><p>It works well for now, though didn&#039;t find an option to increase transmiting power of wireless modul... So, this is the question: am I missing something? I updated a list of packages in the &quot;System/Installed software&quot; menu, but there are so many different packages, I don&#039;t know which ones to choose to gain this feature?</p><p>Help required <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Luka</p>									</div>

					<p>Generally increasing the power is pointless as all the clients would need increased power too.<br />If you use Ch1, Ch6 and Ch11&nbsp; alternately on airpoints on same network, with same SSID, and Key, then you can move around the building using actually lower power.</p><p>Less chance of interference or a long range hacker</p>									</div>
