					<p>Is there any reason why the image builder comes with x86_64 binaries compiled against an ancient libstdc++? What&#039;s wrong with offering normal 32-bit binaries that work on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines, instead of binaries that only work on&nbsp; 64-bit ones (with the right libs available)?...</p><p>It won&#039;t work on any of my machines, and on my box at work I can&#039;t get a 64-bit libstdc++5 installed. Pretty annoying... :-/</p><p>If this is because of problems on 64-bit machines, why not include both 64- and 32-bit binaries?</p>									</div>

					<p>Short answer is that it&#039;s a conspiracy, we could post 32bit binaries, but then we&#039;d have to actually build 32bit binaries. The developers are using 64bit machines.</p><p>In all honesty I&#039;m not even sure why we&#039;re posting the SDK binaries; the sources are setup such that they&#039;ll attempt to automatically download and compile anything needed, including the (cross) compiler.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know I can build it myself, but the prebuilt IB seemed like such a nice time-saver. :-(</p><p>Although the prebuilt images actually do work pretty well too. But I&#039;m trying to figure out how to get / back on a RAM filesystem that can be saved to flash manually (&quot;flash save&quot;), and I suppose the way to do that is build my own image. And on a model with just 4 MB flash it&#039;d be nice to get rid of stuff like PPP.</p><p>Oh well, even like this OpenWRT is still quite a timesaver. Thanks for all the work. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>To have more people access to a customizable firmware, is good for the testing.<br />I have Ubuntu linux running in &quot;virtual PC 2007&quot; from Microsoft, which lacks 64 bits emulation on 32 bits hardware.....<br />Would it not be nice to have a platform free firmware build system ?<br />I think this is possible with Python. This is available on windows and Linux (unix) platform.<br />I don&#039;t understand the building process of an image, but what I see is the following:<br />1 make a catalog of all available packages<br />2 extract the files to a temporary place<br />3 copy user specific file over it<br />4 make a squashfs image (or effs2??)<br />Step 1,2 and 3 are working on my linux pc. This could also be done by Python.<br />Step 4 gives an error because &quot;mksquashfs.lzma&quot; is 64bits. Can anyone point me to the source so I can make it into Python ?<br />Or some explanation of the process ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, as you say it&#039;s the developer&#039;s choice, and maybe it will improve over time. I notice also that only a small subset of mipsel binary packages is currently available; for example there&#039;s libpcap but no tcpdump. I hope that will improve too. Admittedly, Kamikaze does support a much wider range of targets, which makes it harder to release binaries of everything.</p><p>However, in terms of build platform, it&#039;s relatively easy to build 32 bit binaries on a 64 bit system.
