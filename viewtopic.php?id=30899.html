					<p>Hi,</p><p>I know this is probably viewed as a crazy request but just bought this router and even though I am fairly computer literate never mucked about with firmware etc etc.</p><p>So can anyone give me a hand to return the router back to factory firmware, I have successfully telnet&#039;d into the router and it seems to have the following interface:</p><p>BusyBox v1.18.5 (2011-06-28 etc etc</p><p>I have tried to read the forum posts and confused about having to cut the first part of firmware ?</p><p>Downloaded the latest firmware from TP Link&#039; site so now need a little bit of help to either install an openWRT with a web interface ?</p><p>Only thing I am going to do with the router is use it for a 3G connection when I travel, nothing clever at all.</p><p>As it appears to maybe better than the bog std sky router then I was going to play around using it as the main router linked to the sky one ?</p><p>Appreciate the forum is more for people wanting to be unconstrained but just do not have the knowledge to understand.</p><p>Thanks for any input</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Noidea,<br />It seems to me that I&#039;m having issue as you had, I&#039;m also trying to get back to the original firmware.&nbsp; I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT without the web interface and now I don&#039;t know how can I install drivers into the router (I also happen to have the TP-Link mr3420) - The Internet connection I have is only through USB modem which isn&#039;t recognized by the router. I was trying to upload some files to the router by LAN using tftpserver but I nothing seems to work so far.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
