					<p>That&#039;s pretty basic knowledge I&#039;d say...</p><p>802.11an: 5 GHz radio (802.11n is a protocol on both 2,4 GHz and 5 GHz band)<br />802.11bgn: 2,4 GHz radio.</p><p>Hence the &#039;dual band&#039;. It&#039;s up to you do find out which is better suited to your usage.</p><p>HT means &#039;high throughput&#039;, the numbers indicate the channel width. Ie HT20 is a 20 MHz wide channel, HT40 double. </p><p>This is very public information, a Google search would turn this up as well, along with all the background info if you&#039;re interested in how the spec works.</p>									</div>

					<p>k thanks, what&#039;s the advantage of 5ghz?.. on my wdr3600 the default transmit power is 17db (50mw) and that&#039;s also maximum,&nbsp; why? it&#039;s so low the signal is 0 bars 15 feet away, once i was able to change the transmit power to something around 300mw but the signal strength still sucked, so i changed it to 1000mw and i got an error saying &quot;invalid value&quot; and the transmit power reverted back to 17 and locked me out from setting it any higher...<br />is this normal or openwrt is screwed up?&nbsp; i&#039;m using trunk built yesterday</p>									</div>

					<p>5 GHz offers higher bandwidth at the expense of lower range. I believe transmit power is limited by country regulations. Don&#039;t know what enters into the equation concerning power limits.</p>									</div>

I can feed my 120mbit home line with wr1043nd@2.4GHz, but only in the same room.</p>									</div>
