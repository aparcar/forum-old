					<p>I have a few La Fonera&#039;s that I would like to use as wireless linux clients. IOW - I don&#039;t want them to be routers, AP&#039;s, etc. Essentially, I want the absolute smallest configuration of OpenWRT that can connect to another AP as a client for net access. The existing network uses WEP, due to gaming adapters, old Macs, etc. (Yes, I know - not exactly secure, but it&#039;s better than nothing)</p><p>I need to strip the image down to the bare minimum necessary to get the &quot;router&quot; on the local network, leaving the rest for my application.</p><p>Also, what do I need to do to cross-compile my app for OpenWRT on the La Fonera? Beyond the arch difference (MIPS vs IA32), is there anything I need to do library wise? The code is all ANSI C, and is fairly POSIX compliant. Although this is my first foray into an embedded linux, I&#039;ve done stand-alone apps for PPC &amp; Microblaze (Xilinx&#039; &quot;soft&quot; 32-bit RISC processor). The trick is that the Xilinx EDK is programmed for cross-compilation by default - so I&#039;ve never done it by hand.</p><p>BTW - what I intend to do is attach a small FPGA to the unused GPIO, probably a Xilinx Spartan 3E-100 (XC3S100E). The idea is to use the Fonera to configure the FPGA using GPIO, then connect to the FPGA using SPI afterwards. 5 pins are perfect for this application, so long as you are willing to stick to a 3-wire SPI link, and deal with a bidirectional data line (SDIO). This eliminates the FLASH configuration memory, resulting in a single chip solution, though I will probably go ahead and add a MAX3232 chip for RS232 level translation. The other advantage to this method is that I can &quot;upgrade&quot; the FPGA firmware image remotely without having to deal with JTAG - just wget/tftp the new firmware down, and restart the app.</p><p>The FPGA will handle the hardware end of the application, while the Fonera&#039;s MIPS processor runs the software end of the application.</p><p>Note: The latest Xilinx part, the XC3S50AN, would be absolutely PERFECT - were they obtainable by mere mortals. (the &#039;AN&#039;s have internal configuration memory, and only need 2 supply voltages - Vccint, and Vccaux/Vccio)</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not using Kamikaze - yet. Remember, the La Fonera is running OpenWRT already - just a highly modified version. I&#039;ve been looking at the gpio driver from <a href="http://fghhgh.150m.com">http://fghhgh.150m.com</a>/ for reference.</p><p>Right now, I&#039;ve just loaded the gpio driver on the existing firmware, which is useful enough at the moment. Eventually, I plan to load a standard OpenWRT image on it, once all of FON&#039;s necessary changes are backported.</p><p>Unfortunately, I&#039;m not that familiar with Linux - I&#039;m more of a hardware guy. I have been cutting my teeth in embedded programming with the Xilinx tools - but those are standalone apps. I have done some coding in FreeBSD, but it was all application level stuff - no down and dirty kernel-level stuff.</p><p>So, I have no idea how to write a filesystem driver. The best I can hope for is to register a new SPI interface in /proc. I&#039;m also going to attempt to write/port an SVF player that will configure the FPGA via GPIO as well, but I&#039;m not sure how useful that will be if you aren&#039;t attaching FPGA&quot;s. (essentially, the system will configure the FPGA, check for the CONF_DONE pin going high, then register the new SPI interface)</p><p>I&#039;m working on a way to coordinate HVAC systems without running a whole bunch of cables. The La Fonera&#039;s will essentially run the scheduling software, and the wireless link will allow me to remotely administer it without having to run a cat5 cable. The FPGA will essentially be an I/O expander - providing serial communication to thermostats, monitoring the HVAC equipment, etc. A CPLD would do, if I could find a big enough one, but at $12/each, the XC3S100E has a sea of gates for cheap.</p><p>I&#039;ve been working on this problem from a different angle, using 2.4GHz radio modems and Xilinx FPGA boards, but the La Fonera is a superior solution all-around. For one, it already has Linux ported to it, and it already has a working radio. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Note - the original application ran on a FreeBSD host, using PCI cards for I/O. Unfortunately, when I moved, my wife forbade me from &quot;rigging up&quot; the house again, hence the need for wireless. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
