					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;d like to use OpenWRT on a DreamPlug and I&#039;m a newbee in this kind of work.<br />I understand that OpenWRT already supports Sheevaplug.<br />Could someone help me in finding tutorials describing how to add a new platform into OpenWrt? <br />I hope this could be quite simple since I only have to derivate from sheevaPlug profile.</p><p>Sorry if this question has already been treated somewhere in the wiki or the forum.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok,</p><p>I&#039;ve found the answer by myself.</p><p>Actually, Dreamplug is detected as &quot;Marvell GuruPlug Reference Board&quot; rather than Sheevaplug. That&#039;s quite normal because Dreamplug is more similar to GuruPlug.</p><p>Just had to include support of &quot;Marvell GuruPlug Reference Board&quot; in make kernel_menuconfig -&gt; system type -&gt; Marvell Kirkwood Implementations. <br />I also have deactivated the GPIO support since I met a problem during boot. I&#039;m not sure this is necessary but I didn&#039;t tried to reactivate for the moment.</p><p>I found the answer about new platform support as well. This is described in the documentation available in the docs/ directory from the sources (chapter 2.4: &quot;Adding platform support &quot;).</p>									</div>
