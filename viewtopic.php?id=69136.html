					<p>I have a wndr3400v1 device that I&#039;m considering loading openwrt on. The wiki page seems a bit out of date, so I wanted to ask if anybody has experience with this specific device. In particular, I&#039;d like to know if the wifi on/off switch on the back works under openwrt, as I prefer to physically turn off the wifi when not in use. Is there anything else I should know before trying to ditch the stock firmware? I&#039;m new to openwrt, so I&#039;m hoping this will go relatively smoothly.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Usually when there is a build for a specific model, features like that are hooked up.</p><p>Note that open support for Broadcom wifi chips is incomplete.&nbsp; You may not get very good wifi performance.&nbsp; &nbsp; You could try ddwrt as a third party firmware, because they have licenses with Broadcom for their closed-source drivers.</p><p>It should have a CFE recovery mode which makes it pretty simple to flash back to stock if you aren&#039;t satisfied.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Dec 2016, 15:33)</p>
