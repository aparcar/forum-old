					<p>I&#039;m pretty new to Linux and OpenWrt. I&#039;ve installed it and it&#039;s working fine. At the moment I&#039;ve installed qosfw to see how it works. Anyway I&#039;d like to try out the script made by Rudy ( <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4112">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4112</a> ) and have a few questions how to set it up.</p><p>First of all, how do I actually uninstall qosfw (or do I even have to do that, I could just disable it)? I don&#039;t want any leftovers laying around. And second, where should this script be put to function? In a S?? under /etc/init.d/?<br />I do realise that I need to have certain modules installed, that&#039;s not a problem since most of them are installed since I tried qosfw.</p><p>And while I&#039;m at it, am I supposed to add start-scripts to my liking in the directory /etc/init.d ? Are they executed from 00 to 99? And what problems could arise from making scripts start in a incorrect order?</p><p>Thanks for all help in advance. I&#039;ve tried to look through the FAQ&#039;s but haven&#039;t been able to find some documentation about the basic understanding of the system, if I just missed it feel free to point it out.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you will find most of your questions answered in the original thread. Removing the qosfw package takes the &#039;ipkg remove&#039; command. See &#039;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Using?highlight=%28ipkg%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Usi â€¦ %28ipkg%29</a>&#039;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Rudy for the reply!</p><p>A question about setting up you script, I&#039;ve done some further research just cd&#039;ing through the directories on the router... I can &quot;enable&quot; your script by making a S??-file in the /etc/hotplug.d/wan, as far as I understand this file will executed automatically if an internet connection is discovered?</p>									</div>
