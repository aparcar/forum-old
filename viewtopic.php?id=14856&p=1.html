					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Today I started to fight with my WL-500gP V2 router. When I discovered, that this is V2, my first thought was to bring it back, to get the older version, however, when I studied the specs, I&#039;ve decided to try to get it running with Kamikaze.<br />After disassembling, I have discovered, that it has nice pins for soldering of serial connector (3,3V, so you need a level converter, however I use the USB-RS cable for old Siemens mobile) (the pin layout is as follows: 1: +3.3V, 2: RX, 3: TX, 4: GND - however double check it in your hardware!!!).<br />I&#039;ll publish the pictures of the disassembled device, as soon as I find good method for placing of relatively big images on this forum.</p><p>I succesfully flashed the device with the Kamikaze, using the diagnostic mode, however the router didn&#039;t start, or at least I was not able to communicate with it.<br />My serial console has displayed (I&#039;ve changed the MAC number and DEVICE PIN for privacy reasons):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Decompressing..........done

					<p>I have investigated the sources provided by the Asus, and I&#039;have found that the main change for the BCM5354 CPU is associated with the WATCHDOG_CLOCK frequency.<br />in sbchipc.h <br />#define WATCHDOG_CLOCK_5354&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;32000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/* Hz */<br />in sbextif.h <br />#define WATCHDOG_CLOCK&nbsp; 48000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /* Hz */<br />and then in the time.c:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /* Set the watchdog timer to reset after the specified number of ms */<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (watchdog &gt; 0) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (sb_chip(sbh) == BCM5354_CHIP_ID)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sb_watchdog(sbh, WATCHDOG_CLOCK_5354 / 1000 * watchdog);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sb_watchdog(sbh, WATCHDOG_CLOCK / 1000 * watchdog);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p><p>So it seems, that the first reason for not booting of the OpenWRT on WL500gPV2 may be just incorrect WATCHDOG_CLOCK frequency, which leads to the timer interrupts occuring with 48000000/32000=15000 lower frequency then needed!<br />As a first &quot;quick&amp;dirty&quot; trick, I&#039;ve modified the WATCHDOG_CLOCK in OpenWRT sources to the value 32000. I&#039;ll let you know if it helped, as soon as the new image compiles.<br /><strong><em>Update:</em></strong><br />Unfortunately, this simple patch didn&#039;t work. However it seems,that there is something wrong with the structure of the trx file.<br />Because the loader reads only the first 3732 bytes:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Loader:raw Filesys:tftp Dev:eth0 File:: Options:(null)

					<p>I have followed the following procedure, described on the OpenWRT wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/BuildingKamikazeHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Bui … ikazeHowTo</a>:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>svn co https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/

make world</code></pre></div><p>One suggestion: I have used &quot;make V=99&quot; instead of &quot;make&quot;.<br />Otherwise sometimes the process hangs quietly when needs some input from the user. This happened to me when I have accepted the certificate only temporarily <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14965">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14965</a>, and than (with the kernel 2.6 version) during the kernel compilation (the make wanted to ask me about one new configuration option (PPS if I remeber correctly).<br /><strong>IMPORTANT WARNING!</strong><br />You need to have the serial console connected! I have not checked if the router is accessible from net after the reflashing, before some hand made adjustments are done (via the serial console)!<br />To install the serial console you have to disassemble the device (= loss of warranty)<br /><strong><em>Update</em></strong><br />My router, after flashing accepts the telnet connection on 192.168.1.1 (or ssh after setting of the password) on the LAN ports.<br />However I&#039;m not sure if it will work the same way in case in <span class="bbu">your</span> router. I think that flashing without the serial console is always very risky.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wzab</strong> on 20 Mar 2008, 12:51)</p>
