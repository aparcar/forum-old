					<p>Hi, i&#039;m using kamikaze 8.09 on alix 2d3, with a wireless mini-pci TP-Link 660g. My problem is that i can&#039;t have a virtual wireless interface in ap mode and another in client mode, when i have both any of them works. If i remove one of them the other works fine. My question is if is still posible&nbsp; work in ap and client mode at the same time, in kamikaze 7.09 it was working for me. I&#039;m using the madwifi drivers, i tried ath5k but didn&#039;t work or didn&#039;t know how to make it work.<br />Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again, i&#039;ve solved my problem, it turns out that i had to specify a wireless channel. I had the channel selection in auto and&nbsp; this way only works as client mode only or ap mode. So i just selec ed one of the channels and all is working fine now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>motoko28</strong> on 5 Jun 2009, 09:39)</p>
