					<p>I&#039;m using Dmitry&#039;s kernel on a PQI, but I&#039;m a bit bothered by the fact that it reports 50 BogoMIPS instead of &gt;400 like with the old kernel, and the whole thing does feel quite slow (I&#039;m trying to use Debian on it).<br />I&#039;ve tried building my own kernel with CONFIG_PLL_CPU_HCLK_192_192_96 set instead of CONFIG_PLL_CPU_HCLK_192_96_96 (which is what Dmitry&#039;s config file comes with), since I got hints from this threads that the latter corresponded to a slower clock speed... but no change.<br />So, do you know how to bring the card to the full 196MHz? Can I use CPUFreq (on 2.6.32)?<br />Also, am I confused or Dmitry&#039;s provided kernel config doesn&#039;t actually enable all the features (swap, sysfs...) that his binary build enables?

					<p>I am a big fan of the PQI Air Card, and I&#039;m so pleased that I can modify the firmware. </p><p>This is my setup: <br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HJrjVda.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/HJrjVda.jpg" /></span></p><p>I have an iPod. I replaced the hard drive with a CF to iPod adaptor. I then have an SD to CF adaptor. Inside there, I have the PQI Air Card. I then have an SD female to microSD male ribbon cable. Then I have a Trio Card (microSD to USB and SD), and finally a microSD card. </p><p>- The PQI Air Card will not boot with the iPod-formatted memory card (Apple&#039;s bootloader partition confuses it, even though the main partition is FAT32). However, the Air Card passes through the SD, and the iPod boots just fine. <br />- Swapping in an SD card from a camera means that the iPod will not boot to music, only Disk Mode. But the PQI Air Card does boot, and it draws power from the iPod battery. </p><p>This lets me have an SD to WiFi media server in my pocket, and it is also an iPod. </p><p>Other iPod mods (Rockbox) work just fine. </p><p>Yesterday I tested the PQI Air Card with a SanDisk 512GB SDXC card, through the SD to microSD ribbon cable. I&#039;m pleased to say that it works great!</p><p>Now I just wish that the firmware could be updated to support other filesystem formats and partitioning schemes (FAT16, HFS, iPod). </p><p>I also wrote a CGI-based chat app for the PQI Air Card that I can use to exchange text messages and share photos. But I wish the PQI Card supported PHP, because then I could use a lot of other web apps of mine. </p><p>Please let me know what you think about my setup! And if you have ideas about FAT16, HFS, or PHP, then please reply and point me in the right direction. </p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>Peter, it&#039;s relatively easy to update the firmware to support more filesystems (not sure about the iPod one, though).<br />You need to build a kernel with support for the filesystems you want enabled, using sources that you can find - for example - on Transcend&#039;s website (not sure if PQI also offers them, per license they should!), and then you can just flash the normal PQI firmware after replacing its Image3 file with the copy you built.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good to see others are still working on this. I have been working on my own project, which is to use the transcend in a psion 5mx. The aim is to use it as (1) storage for the psion (in a CF-&gt;SD adapter) (2) A network connection for the psion, using ppp over serial (the psion only has serial, IR and CF) and (3) a built in 300MHz arm system.</p><p>So far I have got a custom kernel (2.6.32.28) with the serial console disabled, and ppp modules built. I discovered that the binaries from the AT91 packages for openwrt work fine in the factory initrd. You can get those here: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/at91/9263/packages/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_ … /packages/</a></p><p>I&#039;ve used the initrd from Dmitry Grinberg and added pppd (and libgcc which is needed to use the openwrt packages). I&#039;ve configured it to start pppd at boot and use inetd to to start telnetd (bound to the ppp interface so you can&#039;t telnet in over wifi). So now the Psion can connect via ppp and telnet into the card - my psion has wifi!</p><p>I have two issues at the moment:</p><p>(1) The serial port on the transcend refuses to work at anything other than 38400. This is really slow for ppp (the psion can go up to 230400). I suspect a kernel bug. uboot seems to configure the serial port and nothing that happens later will change it (even setting console=ttyS0 115200n8 line<br />as the default console setting has no effect, you still get 38400 which is why I think there is a bug). I am thinking of looking at the uboot source and seeing if I can change it there.</p><p>(2) Unfortunately the psion doesn&#039;t provide enough power for the card. I am planning to put a 3.3V boost regulator in the psion with a FET that turns it on only when needed, which should fix this issue.</p><p>I also still haven&#039;t tested actual routing using the card.</p><p>If anyone wants any of my files, let me know and I&#039;ll put them up somewhere.</p>									</div>

					<p>static-void: Yes, please upload your files to github or somewhere!</p><p>Great idea about using ppp-serial. I was thinking about something similar to add WiFi to the Raspberry Pi, but I hadn&#039;t thought through the details (I was just going to use telnet to the PQI Air Card and then again to the RPi to control it, but without real network access). </p><p>It&#039;s a pity that the Psion doesn&#039;t provide enough power. My old iPod does, when booted in Disk Mode. Check that it&#039;s not a formatting issue (an iPod-formatted card has multiple partitions, and the PQI Air Card demands a single FAT32 card to boot). </p><p>I&#039;m glad that you&#039;re still working on this too! I hope that this kind of device (based on the KeyAsic processor) could be the future of mobile computing, led by DIY hackers instead of large companies.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m actually a bit surprised that people have said the card doesn&#039;t like partitioning... I&#039;ve had mine partitioned and it doesn&#039;t seem to mind at all. I think as long as the first partition is FAT32 it should be ok.</p><p>The psion actually sees the SD card fine (as long as it is partitioned as 4 2GB partitions, as it doesn&#039;t like partitions over 2GB), but the keyasic doesn&#039;t start up. Or rather it begins to start, I see uboot start on the serial line and then it trails off into garbage, then nothing. So I&#039;m fairly sure it&#039;s a power issue.</p><p>I&#039;ve ordered a 3.3V boost converter and a FET, so I&#039;ll disconnect the traces that normally power the CF in the psion and connect them to the FET to turn on the 3.3V regulator using power from the batteries, and connect the output of the regulator to the CF socket power pins.</p><p>I&#039;ll upload my stuff somewhere (really it&#039;s just a kernel image and initrd) soon.</p><p>Your wireless ipod project also sounds cool <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The only issue with using the wifisd for wireless on the raspberry pi is that you&#039;re limited to the speed of a serial port, which is not generally particularly great. On the psion I have no real choice, as the only thing it&#039;s got which is faster is the compact flash, and I need that to store data (also EPOC, the psion OS, doesn&#039;t support compact flash network cards). I&#039;d also suggest partitioning and booting the rpi off of the second partition if possible, to avoid contention with the ka2000.</p>									</div>

However I don&#039;t think this is actually possible without major software changes, and we don&#039;t know how the SD switch works. The problem is that the software on both devices assumes it is the only thing with access to the disk. Syncing is the issue, in the stock linux you run a program to refresh the sd card, and it takes a while. So although this might kind of work, it would be slower than a serial port I think, unless you wanted to transfer a lot of data without any syncing needed (like a big file) and then fetch it on the other end. </p><p>Also, I don&#039;t know what speed the serial port on the keyasic can manage, it might be faster than 230400bps though, so for more modern devices you might be able to do faster connections.</p>									</div>

					<p>So is there any tested WifiSD card which supports SPI mode and has linux inside (Eye-fi, Flashair, ...)?</p><p>Unfortunately new Transcend is not working with SPI devices.</p><p>Flashair looks nice (GPIO ports) but no confirmation on SPI mode (accessing internal SD memory, not driving attached peripherals like LCD).</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>This thread is quite long and a lot of old info. Has anyone used one of these cards recently and gotten rsync to work running from the card? For me it seems the most useful way to get one of these cards to work is configure it to connect to my Wifi network, and once the connection works, to run rsync to synchronize the files from the card to a remote machine.</p>									</div>
