					<p>This modem router has two cpu&#039;s. The RT3052 for ethernet and wifi and a TC3162LE for adsl stuff.</p><p>I&#039;ve done some reading and understand how to add the new board to ramips linux.</p><p>The TC3162LE runs it&#039;s own firmware, has its own ram, flash and uart. So im hoping that it will work with openwrt running on the RT3052.</p><p>I dont know how it&#039;s conected to the rest of the router but im going to find out. If anyone has any information about the TC3162LE please let me know.</p>									</div>

					<p>Im ready to start at this but i would rather take a look at the source before going at it like a bull at a gate.<br/>I&#039;ve tried contacting Huawei several times and had no reply. They&#039;ve posted source code to some of their other devices online so theres no reason they shouldn&#039;t do it for this one.</p><p>If you fancy giving it a go the addresses are:</p><p>source code request:<br/>terminal[at]huawei.com</p><p>open source complience officer:<br/>foss[at]huawei.com</p><p>I&#039;ll keep mailing them too. Hopefully they&#039;ll get fed up and just release it.</p>									</div>
