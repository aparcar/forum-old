					<p>Greetings,</p><p>My name is Eduardo Sousa, </p><p> I am looking for a OEM router with the following characteristics:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Runs a Linux distribution (preference something like Open-WRT or Debian)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The processor speed must be at least 300MHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The ram must be at least 64MB (more then 128 is desirable)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The flash must be greater them 64MB (We prefer more then 128MB 32 might be ok to but not desirable)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The system can have 8MB or 4Mb of flash but it must have a secondary storage unit like a sd card or compact flash. (USB is not a option)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Must have at least 1 USB port (We perfer 2 USB ports)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Wireless is optional (I do not really need it)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It must have a real-time clock (It cannot loose is date after a reboot even without network connection)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It must have a case / enclosure</p><p>There are some characteristic that are not requirements but we like to know if they exist.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Possibility to re-brand the case with no logo or a company logo different then the manufacturer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; GPIO access (input and output)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Serial port to access the OS terminal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JTAG port to upload the firmware<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Serial port to connect to devices (not connection to the Linux terminal)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RS232 port to connect to devices (not connection to the Linux terminal)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RS485 port to connect to devices<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SPI port to connect to devices<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I2C port to connect to devices<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Led control via software</p><p>Do you know something that might have this characteristics?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have yet to see any inexpensive SOHO WiFi router with 128M+ RAM, let alone CPU clock @1GHz+. If your project is meant to be an end product, any inexpensive (chances are discontinued) Linux embedded devices powered by an ARM (single or multi) processor comes with at least 128M+ RAM, CPU clock @1GHz+, 1 RJ45 10/100/1000Mbps port. and 1+ USB2 ports. Some of these devices come with a built-in WiFi + Bluetooth supports. Such inexpensive devices are mostly discontinued and are still freely available @ Amazon, e-Bay, etc. BTW, if your budget is around $70, you may even be able to get an old/discontinued 7&quot; Tablet PC powered by a dual-core ARM processor, i.e. <a href="http://1saleaday.com">eLocity 7&quot; Android Tablet</a> w/ 1.2GHz Tegra II Processor, 4GB Flash Memory, Capacitive Multi-Touch Screen + Case (Today - 09/04/2012 - ONLY). Currently, this device is NOT supported by OpenWRT, but doesn&#039;t mean OpenWRT can&#039;t be ported to this device. If you ported OpenWRT to this device, you can even turn it into a 4G/WiFi router with an external USB 4G/WiFi dongle.</p>									</div>
