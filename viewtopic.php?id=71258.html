					<p>The switch config itself seems valid, though I rarely see names on the &#039;switch_vlan&#039; sections. Usually their name is derived from the device + VLAN combo.</p><p>How do you determine that it is really swconfig that is not working? After a power cycle, does &#039;swconfig dev switch0 show&#039; state that you have no VLANs at all?</p>									</div>

					<p>It resets to the default 2 VLANS the router defaults in, but the network file itself is as I left it in. Also, I Run swconfig and it Does change the VLANS and all, and then, the 2 wan interfaces works as it should, but the moment I power cycle, it&#039;s the moment the VLANS resets, and it only works on the original WAN, but the configuration of the WAN2 interface it&#039;s still there too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shyiro</strong> on 17 Jun 2017, 20:28)</p>

					<p>Check your switch name. Or simply change switch name from &#039;eth0&#039; to &#039;switch0&#039;</p>									</div>
