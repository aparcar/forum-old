					<p>Hi, <br />First post on this forum ever, so extremely sorry for any mistake/noob-ality.</p><p>Also, even though I am having an issue with an OPKG package, I am using it on my Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H with Buffalo&#039;s &quot;pro&quot; firmware (17798) which is actually DD-WRT under the hood... Please don&#039;t hold it against me.</p><p>The procedure I wrote and used to get opkg working is detailed on <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/98408/how-to-install-additional-software-on-your-router-dd-wrt/">howtogeek</a>.</p><p>I am now working on the followup article of installing and using the &quot;transmission-daemon&quot;.<br />without going into too much detail (which i can give if requested), I got it working and was able to download several Linux ISOs with it. However, when downloading the <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/iso/2011.08.19/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso.torrent">Arch linux torrent</a>, the daemon crashes.</p><p>To overcome this i have tried:<br />* Use earlier versions of the &quot;libs&quot; and package respectively.<br />* limit the download rate (which didn&#039;t seem to work at all).<br />* limit the amount of global connections to 60 and per torrent to 20 (as seen on another post).<br />* create and use a swap file.</p><p>Please help and thank you in advance for any reply, hotfortech.</p>									</div>
