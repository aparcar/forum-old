					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a VGV7519 with 3 Lantiq PHY&#039;s. But there seems to be an issue.</p><p>There are 2 versions of the VGV7519 R01 and R02. They both have another version of the PHY chip.</p><p>The PHY&#039;s are all technically functioning but some of the ports are not giving a propper LED signal. Example:</p><p>R01: Does have 1 correctly working LED on LAN3 and 4 impropper configured LEDs.<br />R02: Does have 4 correctly working LEDs on WAN1 and LAN1,2,3 and a incorrectly LED on LAN4.</p><p>With impropper working LED I mean that it is continually lit(with and without activity on the port) when there is a Gigabit-ethernet link and continually blinking(100hz) when there is a fast Ethernet link. So it seems that the LED is indicating the link speed instead of the activity.</p><p>Does some one have an idea? I have posted thesame question in another topic but because this is such a specific problem I tought it is better to start a seperate topic.</p><p>Regards,<br />Timeless</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Timeless</strong> on 3 May 2016, 13:07)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve tested the outcome of that patch. And it seems that everything is fixed for R02. But R01 does have all ports show &quot;some&quot; activity. And with &quot;some&quot; I mean that the led blinks so now and often instead of blinking for every packet like the others do. even when I ping the gateway itself it only blinks 1 time in like 4 seconds. R01 has LEDs LAN1, LAN2 working and LAN3, LAN4 and WAN in a semi-working state. But atleast it is not hyperblinking anymore.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Timeless</strong> on 1 May 2016, 23:16)</p>

					<p>Yeah that now and often blinking was the issue I&#039;m talking about. I was able to fix it for my vgv7510kw22 and since your vgv7519 is near to identical to my device, the same changes should do the job.</p><p>// Edit</p><p>Forget about it. The GPIO configuration on your device is way more complex.

					<p>Thanks for your reply. I understand the theoretical VLAN principle <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> and I will check it tonight after work. I think that the VGV7519 has a default LAN setup on eth0 and the WAN on a separate eth1 because it is configured to use ADSL/VDSL as WAN instead of the WAN-RJ45. And the VGV7510KW22 uses the RJ46 as ethernet WAN tough the IP101A LF? On the ToC page for the VGV7519 I noticed that there is no swconfig support for the lantiq switch? (Please note that the creator of that article has copied text from the ARV7510pw ToC page so I don&#039;t know what is accurate and what is not)</p><p>Currently I&#039;m using a trunk r49274 image which was the lastest version during my compile time last week.</p><p><em>Ps. I also saw that user pe0fko has problems with the VLANs and USB on the VGV7519 <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64587">link</a>. I updated the topic description to include VLAN from now on, and maybe USB?

The patches for adding support for the IP101A are sitting in my local queue. The RJ45 port is used for xDSL as well as ethernet. The Pins 1,2,3,6 of the RJ45 are connected to the IP101A and the pins 4,5 are connected to xdsl chip. IMHO a neat solution.</p><p>Working on supporting the IP101A was the reason why I had a look at the vlan stuff.</p><p>So, the VGV7510KW22 as it&#039;s in current trunk, has four lan ports and similar to the HomeHub 5, a more or less useless default VLAN set up.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Timeless wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>On the ToC page for the VGV7519 I noticed that there is no swconfig support for the lantiq switch?
