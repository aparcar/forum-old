					<p>after some issues getting started with openwrt X86 which i posted some questions about, i got it working. and decided to try a kamikaze 8.09.2 xwrt build. anyway, basically, i have the openwrt with luci working fine. but in xwrt, i can&#039;t seem to configure the wan port. basically, i have it connected to my switch thats going to my current dd-wrt box that i&#039;m looking to replace. and it gets an ip. then i have a computer hooked up to the xwrt box, and it doesn&#039;t seem to get an ip from the xwrt system. i have to set one static. but i can&#039;t seem to get it to connect to the internet the way it did with the standard open wrt.....</p><p>is there maybe a guide for this somewhere? i can&#039;t find much on the wiki, i&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s one on the forum that i&#039;m just not finding?</p><p>basically, all i want on this box, since it has dual lan ports, so one being eth0 and the other eth1. i want eth0 to be the wan port to uplink to the rest of my network, or to the internet when i get it completely setup and swap out my dd-wrt box, and eth1 to be the lan port that will go to a switch. i had it working with the standard openwrt, and i&#039;m sure i&#039;m missing something, i feel like an idiot right now, it should be essentially the same underneath whether i&#039;m using xwrt or luci to configure right?</p><br /><p>oh, just an aside, i just ordered this board, does it not look absolutely perfect for an openwrt box<br /><a href="http://www.bcmcom.com/bcm_product_mx945gse3.htm">http://www.bcmcom.com/bcm_product_mx945gse3.htm</a></p>									</div>

					<p>well, i got it working.</p><p>i swapped my other CF card in with the regular prebuilt openwrt x86, and removed luci, and added webif via ssh. not sure what was wrong with the other image, or what i messed up with it, but its working fine now</p>									</div>
