It has tons of features and one flaw that won&#039;t bother you if you use mrtg. (see the snmpd note below for an explanation) The HOWTO is at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/snmp.server">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/snmp.server</a> </p><p>* mini-snmpd is a truly minimal snmp agent/daemon. It has a very limited set of OIDs, but includes the biggies like system name, interface traffic, etc. I just updated the HOWTO at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/mini_snmpd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/mini_snmpd</a></p><p>I have posted a script to configure snmpd automatically after re-flashing - it&#039;s much easier than fat-fingering the snmpd.conf file. Check the config-openwrt.sh script at <a href="https://github.com/richb-hanover/OpenWrtScripts">https://github.com/richb-hanover/OpenWrtScripts</a></p><p>snmpd note: The flaw in OpenWrt snmpd package is that it only updates counters every 30 seconds. If a SNMP manager (such as MRTG) sends queries every five minutes, it receives accurate results. But if the SNMP manager sends queries a few seconds apart (for example, to see the *current* rate, instead of the five-minute average), snmpd returns the same value during a 30-second interval, which in turn signals that the data rate is zero.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, that was very helpful. Although I don&#039;t need a lot of OIDs, I think I will go with the regular snmpd since mini-snmpd only has 32-bit counters. That could have been a problem, as uptime on these devices can be measured in months and years. I also generate a bit of traffic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>30 seconds between updates shouldn&#039;t be much of a problem, I would probably update every minute or so to get detailed stats.</p><p>Are there any other monitoring tools I should examine that works well with OpenWRT? I&#039;m currently having a look at munin, are there others that are good? Apart from the router, I just want to keep an eye on a few Linux boxes and a Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>

(net-snmp/snmpd is better featured, better tested, etc.)</p><p>- The sysUpTime variable is in 100ths of seconds (centi-seconds) so it&#039;ll wrap at some number like 400+ days. <br />- The 32-bit counters will keep perfectly accurate measurements as long as your SNMP program does the arithmetic properly. (This is true even if the counters roll over from 0xFFFFFFFF to 0x00000001 - the difference with unsigned arithmetic is 2)</p><p>NB: the reason to use 64-bit counters is if you have really high data rates. The counters are of bytes - and if they&#039;re 32-bits long, they will wrap around roughly every 4 billion bytes. If you don&#039;t query the counter frequently enough (you should be querying at least every 1 billion bytes, better every 500 million bytes) then you&#039;ll see wildly inaccurate traffic numbers. </p><p>So a 100 mbit/sec interface is 12.5 mbyte/sec interface. At full rate, you need to sample every 60 seconds to avoid the overflow. That&#039;s the reason for 64-bit counters.</p><p>Note: updated with example for 64-bit interface and that you need to use *unsigned* arithmetic</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 6 May 2015, 20:49)</p>
