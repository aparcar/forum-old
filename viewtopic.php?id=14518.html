					<p>Hello,</p><p>I can&#039;t wait anymore to get my DSL-G624T fully working, and I have but only one last try. I need to make a build that will reliably serve me for the next 4 months. Problems with latest SVN ( I didn&#039;t try 2.6.24 but it seems even more unstable than recent 2.6.23 revisions ) are the following : router always crash after one day or two of use, QoS isn&#039;t working anymore because tc segfaults since the iproute2 update, and shadow passwords don&#039;t work ( I can live without them but they are very welcome if working on some revision ). Does anyone has an old revision which has all of the above fixed + working wireless ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, Thank you. I&#039;m using r10156 at the moment. This is really stable for me: ADSL is fine and so is ethernet. The acx (not acx-mac80211) wireless drivers work(ish). I&#039;m not sure on the status of iproute2/tc or shadow passwords under this snapshot.</p><p>As for current trunk, I really don&#039;t have a clue anymore. For me, the Ethernet seems to have stopped working with the recent 2.6.24 update: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3124">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3124</a></p>									</div>
