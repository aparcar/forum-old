					<p>ya i pretty much said what i wanted in the topic, the stick wouldnt connect under any circumstances, am sending this from a pc with that same EVDO!! though the router says &#039;identify successful&#039; its still not connecting. I live in ethiopia, so i had to manually configure it. It wouldn&#039;t connect after like 10,000 types of configurations, so i figured since it not in the compatibility list i should ask the Gurus. is there a config bin for that model?</p>									</div>
