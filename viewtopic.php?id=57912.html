					<p>Hello, I can&#039;t find anything about ZFS vs OpenWRT in the internet. Only one FS performance comparison where post states ZFS is not supported.<br />My issue is that USB on my router is flacky and I see a lot of silent write errors on otherwise healthy USB storage devices (TL-WR842ND). I found using a hub helps with the situation but still consider using filesystem checksumming required to have any reliability. The only stable FS out there with checksumming seems to be ZFS. Anybody tried using ZFS with OpenWRT?</p><p>Without a checksumming option, I guess, using that router for storage (or any router) is a no go for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you using a HDD? Looks like your router does not provide enough power for the device.<br />Sincerely, I think ZFS is not the right solution here.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, power is no issue as HDD is self-powered and I also tested with usb stick.<br />No matter if power is an issue or not, fact is USB is not reliable as it can silently kill data. A checksumming filesystem can account for that to a great extend. Also you don&#039;t know at what moment some connector gets flacky or whatnot so such filesystem is a good thing anyway.</p>									</div>

					<p>I really think ZFS would be a bad choice on a router, as it tends to be quite memory hungry. It isn&#039;t really intended to be used on this kind of devices, and I suspect you would run into a lot of problems trying to get it running. For a while, I tried to get ZFS running on my Debian file server, and it had severe problems running with just 4GB RAM. Of course, that was with much larger file systems and probably some options you could disable, but still I think something like 128MB (or whatever your router has) would be far from enough.</p><p>In short, I think you would be *much* better off migrating your data to an external HD with external power, and using a supported fs. Or using NFS, and mounting the drive from a file server, then you avoid flaky USB altogether.</p>									</div>

					<p>As I tried to explain I do use a self powered external USB drive that simply can&#039;t work reliably with the router. But your input that ZFS is too memory hungry helps. At least I now know this kind of devices is not capable to serve as NAS. Thank you.</p><p>P.S. some engineers told me it&#039;s that on most routers the USB bus is an afterthought (and not a well done one).

					<p>Rule of thumb for ZFS is: 1 GB (!) of RAM per hard drive formatted with ZFS. My server has 8 GB RAM, and I have just 3 ZFS disks.</p><p>So just one disk puts you at 1+ GB RAM for a well functioning ZFS setup, and then we haven&#039;t discussed CPU requirements yet for some of the compute-intensive stuff it can do (checksumming, mirroring, etc.).</p><p>USB2/3 on most router is constrained - the SoC is often not powerful enough and there&#039;s also the performance loss from using NTFS disks through NTFS-3G.</p>									</div>

					<p>For those who&#039;d wonder, I was using ext4 and at some point I noticed router losing the drive and becoming inaccessible. Then after some fiddling I found out ext4 had corruptions. So using the `badblocks` command&nbsp; with a pattern revealed that data corruption often happens on the write path. Interesting is that no matter what, the read path was working correct. Tested for hours. But writing data resulted in wrong data being put on the device without any kernel errors. Tried external powered HDD and usb stick that work reliably on PC.<br />So issue is not related to filesystem and power (still might be related to CPU load, not sure aobut that).<br />In any case, since checksumming FS is not supported by such small devices, they cannot work well as NAS.</p>									</div>

Much more flexible and reliable. Take a look at FreeBSD or a member of the IllumOS family if you want ZFS, they work really well as file servers with it.</p>									</div>

					<p>FYI: modern highend routers have â‰¥512mb of ram (wrt1900acs, rb3011uias, turris omnia, ...) which **IS** enough for single disk zfs. however zfs without ECC ram defeats the purpose of checksumming. however in your special case you may yield better results despite this...<br />from personal experience, i can also tell you that 8gb of ram is enough for a 16disk zfs array (16x 1tb on ubuntu). way faster than what dual link 1Gbps lan can provide but waaaay slower than the summed up speed of 16 hdds :-) i&#039;d even wager that with 4gb of ram it could still saturate a 1Gbps link...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bernstein</strong> on 13 Jan 2016, 21:49)</p>

					<p>BTRFS would be a better choice for OpenWrt as it&#039;s in kernel and already supported. Or just get a router with solid USB (my wndr3700 and wdr4900 have been 100% reliable) and use a normal fs like ext4.</p>									</div>
