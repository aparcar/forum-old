					<p>The router got bricked after a failed firmware flash. I first tried the TFTP method which did not work. It pulled firmware but afterwards did nothing. I tried multiple firmwares from openwrt, stock, and dd-wrt but nothing worked.</p><p>So serial it is. Well, I don&#039;t know if it was a bad solder job or what but when I connect all three pins(rx, tx, and ground), the router just stops with most of its LEDs lit up. When I disconnect the ground, it boots normally(or tries to) but the serial output is complete garbage.</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p><p>edit: did more tests. If I connect the RX and Ground pins to my adapter, the router boots. but the TX and Ground don&#039;t work together at all. I am seriously lost.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Mangix</strong> on 24 May 2015, 00:02)</p>
