					<p>I have been using pfsense for many years after using proprietary hardware such as Firebox and Juniper. It has served me very well and I have become used to the interface. </p><p>However, I&#039;d like to test openwrt as a router but am not sure I am comparing apples to apples here. <br />Pfsense to me is a full out firewall which I&#039;ve been able to use in both home and business situations where there was a complex LAN behind it.</p><p>Openwrt on the other hand seems to be more of a smaller level firewall, more like what you&#039;d find built into a standard modem or router. </p><p>Am I missing something or am I on track?</p>									</div>

					<p>First off your primary baseline would be comparing the hardware that you intend to use. OpenWRT/LEDE typically gets deployed as firmware for smaller/consumer type embedded routing equipment. That&#039;s not to say you can&#039;t install it on an X86 platform in the same way you do pfsense, just make sure you include that as part of your plan or understand the difference. </p><p>(Maybe a better question is what is there about pfsense that is pushing you away from it and what is there about OpenWRT/LEDE that you see as a draw?)</p><p>Realistically if you put both on equal hardware you should not see any significant differences in performance. Software wise the interfaces will definitely differ but I doubt there&#039;s anything you can ONLY do on PFsense that would not be possible on OpenWRT/LEDE... it just might not be as upfront/readily available. Depends entirely on what your requirements are and what you&#039;re trying to achieve.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, thanks for the reply.</p><p>I am thinking hardware like the TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750 for example, not the small mini routers. </p><p>Nothing is pushing me away from pfsense, I&#039;ll be using it for a long time to come and very often suggest it to others.<br />Mainly, I am interested in learning more about openwrt as a router since I&#039;ve never actually used openwrt for it&#039;s router functionality, usually always as a simple Linux device. For example, loggers, IP cameras, just never as a router.</p><p>I think openwrt is more of a home solution, similar to what comes on consumer grade routers/firewalls. I understand your point about interfaces also. </p><p>Thanks, I think you&#039;ve helped to clear this up for me.</p>									</div>
