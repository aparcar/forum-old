					<p>I&#039;m attempting to recover a DG834v1 that fails to boot. It started exhibiting the flashing power/check LED symptom after being powered down and up again during a site relocation. Prior to the power down, it was working. I attempted to use the Netgear Recovery utility and it appeared to successfully go through the motions of flashing a new image, but on reboot, the same symptoms prevail. I have tried as many images for the DG834G as I can find on the net, but to no avail. I am assuming that the upload works because the version numbers reported by the upload tool differ.</p><p>As the standard year warranty had expired, I opened it up, found an unpopulated serial interface (JP603) and wired it to a MAX232 chip as per the instructions for the v2 of the same router on this and a few other sites. Booting the router with a PC connected and a terminal session at 115200 8N1 gives me the following sequence of events every time:</p><p>1. internet link led (i) comes on orange<br />2. power led comes on green and internet link turns off</p><p>3. The following comes out the serial interface:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ADAM2 Revision 0.18.01
