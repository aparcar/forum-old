					<p>I just recently purchased a Netgear Nighthawk R9000 router and discovered it&#039;s running OpenWRT.&nbsp; I&#039;ve posted my question to their list as well with no responses...&nbsp; Here is the issue:</p><p>Has anyone else noticed file perms changing on their USB drive over time by some process (no idea what process is doing this)?</p><p>As an example I have a media dir /mnt/sda1/nas/media.&nbsp; If I perform a &quot;chmod 755 /mnt/sda1/nas/media/*&quot; I see the perms get set correctly...here is one of the subdirs:<br />drwxr-xr-x&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;root&nbsp; &nbsp; 4096 Apr 16&nbsp; 2017 Photos</p><p>&quot;Sometime&quot; later, the perms will end up going to something like:<br />drwsrwsrwt&nbsp; &nbsp;5 root&nbsp; &nbsp; root&nbsp; &nbsp; 4096 Apr 16 2017 Photos</p><p>I cannot figure out what process is doing this to/for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> At first I thought it was possibly samba (not that I believed it...just a guess).&nbsp; Initially I tried to simply kill both smb and nmb processes but noted those were respawned.&nbsp; An /etc/init.d/samba stop didn&#039;t help either.&nbsp; I saw update_smb would wake up and restart samba.&nbsp; So, I disabled samba in /etc/init.d (via /etc/init.d/samba disable).&nbsp; I also went through all /etc/init.d scripts that had update_smb denoted, and commented out those line.&nbsp; Rebooted the router and no more smb - so far so good.&nbsp; Again, after &quot;some&quot; time the perms changed.&nbsp; So, doesn&#039;t appear to be samba <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m not sure what to look for now.&nbsp; I did some googling in hopes of finding a way to monitor a dir/file and see what process changed it - came up with auditd.&nbsp; Unfortunately I was unable to install it...tried to do so in a chroot&#039;d debian but the kernel support isn&#039;t there.</p><p>Any and all help will be greatly appreciated!</p><p>If one is curious why this matters:&nbsp; as I mentioned, I have a chroot&#039;d instance of debian and I&#039;d like to enable ssh in it.&nbsp; The /etc/ssh dir&#039;s perms are being changed in such a way that sshd gets very unhappy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>flossware</strong> on 10 Dec 2017, 02:04)</p>

					<p>I put ext2 on the USB drive...</p><p>Oddly when I had this on my Buffalo DD-WRT router, I never had this issue at all.&nbsp; Not sure if there is some difference in DD-WRT and OpenWRT (this is my first OpenWRT router - all my past routers have been and are DD-WRT).&nbsp; Not sure if it could be something Netgear is doing with OpenWRT...nothing is obvious to me...</p><p>I did try to disable Samba (as in disabled with no smb, nmb or update_smb running) - still same issue (although it seemed like it took longer)...</p>									</div>
