					<p>I&#039;m in desperate need of instructions on how I can get a couple of custom packages installed on the image I am building. I figured out that I can do this with Image Generator but it apparently won&#039;t let me set other options that I can easily edit with Buildroot, like the initial IP address of the router. Yes, I know I can include config files but there are other issues as well; that said, if there is a way to edit the default build for Image Generator then I&#039;m interested in hearing about that as well. Anyway, I&#039;m figuring that it will be lots easier to do what I need from Buildroot since there&#039;s likely a point in the image build that I can insert my packages; I just can&#039;t seem to find that point at the moment.</p><p>I&#039;d like to say that if the only way is a list of some archaic commands done on command line...count me in.. I&#039;m not afraid of getting my hands dirty..:)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ehrichweiss</strong> on 27 Feb 2012, 18:09)</p>

					<p>No there is indeed no point in adding custom binary packages as part of the normal buildroot compilation procedure, at least not without hackery.<br />Including config files is indeed the preferred way nowadays.

There is nothing special about the files as I have copied them directly from a compiled system, and I know it&#039;s them because that&#039;s the only change to the build. Once I install an image generated like this, the device never recovers from the reboot and I&#039;m forced to use the recovery mode to netcat a clean image onto the system. </p><p>If I include config files under Buildroot, instead of the system logging in under /root, it puts me under / which is a bit unsettling. It has done this in the above situation as well but not recently. </p><p>It should be noted that in both situations the config files are /etc/config/network and /etc/resolv.conf so they have nothing to do with the path.</p><p>If I build with the menuconfig options that you say are going away, and I don&#039;t include the files, the system performs as expected.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ehrichweiss</strong> on 28 Feb 2012, 01:04)</p>

					<p>I can&#039;t reproduce either of your problems. Its also unclear to me how including a network config would brick your device, unless its indeed plain wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>well I can reproduce them time and time again, I even did so with a fresh install from SVN last night(I&#039;m using trunk, FYI, ar71xx and TPWR703N). There&#039;s nothing wrong with the network config file because, as I said, I copied it directly from a working system and the only thing I changed from the default file was a &#039;1&#039; into a &#039;2&#039;. If I leave the image as default and install it and then copy the file over, it works as expected. I&#039;m using Linux on both sides of this equation so it&#039;s not like it&#039;s linefeeds or the like. Running a diff on the files shows no differences. Where else could the problem be? </p><p>(btw, I hate to drag this to troubleshooting since I wanted something else obviously but this may help others as well so I figure why not)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ehrichweiss</strong> on 28 Feb 2012, 18:40)</p>
