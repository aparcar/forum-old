					<p>Hello, I was wondering is it is possible to install an anit-virus program such as ESET NOD for linux or some other anti-virus for linux on OpenWrt for x86 and have it scan network traffic from the wan for the systems on the lan? If so could someone point me to a tutorial or howto? I have done a search but nothing comes up so I am thinking it isn&#039;t possible but thought I would ask anyway just on the off chance someone has done it.</p>									</div>

					<p>AV products search strings of data for known and suspicious patterns. IP traffic is comprised of packets which are, normally said, string fragments. An AV product would need to be a MitM to amass the packets, inspect the reconstituted string and re-transmit the strings to the endpoint recipient. The location of the AV assembler-inspector-transmitter would best be placed in a firewall appliance. These devices exist today.</p>									</div>

The boy&#039;s wasn&#039;t much of a concern but my wife had entered credit card info and such and a lot of the things that came up said that they were used to steal personal info. I am sure there was more than just what their antivirus software showed because their systems would lock up after just a short time without the scans finishing. I thought if I had something that would look at things before it even reached their systems it could hopefully stop some of this from happening.</p>									</div>
