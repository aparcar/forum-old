					<p>Pardon the newb question, but can anyone point out the advantage of using https with ddns hosts?</p><p>So a little background, I&#039;m coming from the DD-WRT community, and I&#039;ve been using dyndns in order to connect to my home network which gets a dynamic ip from Comcast in order to establish an OpenVPN connection to my home network. In that setup, I&#039;d been using the inadyn client for ddns, which, correct me if I&#039;m wrong, uses standard http for ddns updates.&nbsp; I&#039;ve recently transitioned to OpenWRT due to the ever meager offerings from DD-WRT, and I&#039;ve noticed that one can configure https support for ddns.&nbsp; What&#039;s the advantage here, for me, if any? Is there any security risk to using the standard setup?</p><p>FYI, I&#039;ve successfully configured two ddns hosts using Luci, and both seem to be working, just wondering if it&#039;s worth the extra effort to get get that going through https.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently on Backfire 10.03.1 (final).&nbsp; Thanks for any advice you can offer!</p>									</div>
