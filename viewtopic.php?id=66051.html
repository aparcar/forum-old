					<p>I was just wondering if there was a way to assign a different DNS server to static leases as opposed to the clients on DHCP. </p><p>Case is, I have a Raspberry Pi running Pi Hole ad blocker, and I would like to assign that as the DNS server for 2 of my clients while leaving the other clients on Googles DNS servers. </p><p>Can it be done? I&#039;m not all that tech savvy. </p><br /><p>Regards, <br />Hvilsted</p>									</div>
