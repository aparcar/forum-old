					<p>Hey there ixproz,</p><p>Just got back from walking the dogs and fund the wifi patch wouldn&#039;t apply cleanly, and broker the build. *sigh*</p><p>So the patch I thought was in the tree already was a different patch, by the same author around the same time. When I followed the link in your previous post, I found a thread with <strong>two</strong> patches. The first (earlier) patch, was a patch to change a patch already in the tree. Ouch! The second patch (the one you linked to directly) works against a file that isn&#039;t in the tree until the in tree patch is applied. Did you just create a randomly named patch file in&nbsp; target/linux/lantiq/patches-3.10 containing the patch you linked too, or did you manage to apply both patches in the thread manually?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Next step, ignore the previous step. I modified dgn3500sum.c the write out a file to /tmp just to confirm that it was being used (and not crashing, because when I tried running it the first time, it segfaulted) during the build. It is being run, the message file appeared in /tmp, so the images generated should supposedly have the correct checksums embedded in them.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Prototux,<br/>you are right, I&#039;ve just tried to flash the image, it seems run well but I can&#039;t access via ethernet cable.<br/>Just for your info I can connect to the router via wifi, it give me the address with dhcp, I can ping it and connect via telnet to the address 192.168.1.1:)<br/>About you, why I can&#039;t connect to 192.168.1.1 via http (luci interface)?<br/>Thanks<br/>Stefano</p>									</div>
