					<p>This post is a thank you and on offer of free services to the OpenWrt community. As I do not want this to come across as spam, I will explain why I am posting.</p><p>First, who we are. NutPile is a consumer and business Internet performance monitoring service. Reports show frequency, length, average times of outages, latency, automated speed testing, historical data and more. Details show if problems are on the LAN, with the Internet provider or beyond. DDNS and other features are included at no cost. </p><p>An overview can be found at nutpile.com/overview.</p><p><strong>A little history</strong></p><p>What makes OpenWrt valuable to NutPile Networks is that when we needed a tiny embedded device to ship to customers, we came across this project. It was the perfect embedded OS to run our monitoring code, called the &#039;agent&#039;.</p><p>While we also support Windows 7/8/10 and some newer Linux versions such as Centos 7, Debian 7, etc, we needed something for those who cannot or prefer not to keep a PC/server on 24/7. Our OpenWrt dev worked closely with the agent development team and we soon had a device ready to ship.</p><p><strong>Supported hardware</strong></p><p>We currently support devices such as the older TP-Link TL-WR703N and currently ship the GL-Inet MT300N.<br />The agent also runs on the GL-Inet 6416A along with some mini routers called the 3G/4G routers.</p><p>Mainly ar71xx and ramips based models were used to test what we could get away with in terms of resources.<br />The agent requires very little resources so can run on some fairly limited platforms.</p><p><strong>Complimentary service - two free offers</strong></p><p>Member of OpenWrt<br />As a member of this community, you need only to create an account on the NutPile site then use the Contact us form to let us know the agent ID and your Userid on this site. With that, we will happily extend to you six months of free monitoring.</p><p>Supported devices list<br />The NutPile agent runs on the above mentioned platforms however, we wish to compile a list of devices for those that already own their own hardware.</p><p>In your NutPile control panel, when creating a new agent, you will find different versions which you can download and test on your own hardware. After confirming your results as positive, if the device is not listed, we will happily extend you a full year of free monitoring in return for your detailed report.</p><p>Self installed agents generally do not come with a lot of instructions mainly because we have developed for our own needs therefore have not complied much for installation notes. The more information you can provide in terms of installation, auto starting the agent and so on, the better. This will help others to install onto their own hardware as well.</p><p>Again, we offer this as a thank you to the OpenWrt community.</p>									</div>

					<p>The agent is not open source at this time and is mostly C/C++. The agent is downloaded and installed onto OpenWrt along with a few packages. No OpenWrt packages required customization. The code was designed to be portable and, if needed, can be modified by our developers to run on many platforms from inexpensive embedded consumer devices to industrial grade.</p><p>NutPile only recently decided to offer this service as a SaaS and quickly understood that an API would allow affiliates to develop their own agents. This is something we are working on and that should become available this year some time. </p><p>Our mission is to make Internet providers accountable for problems that consumers suffer and very often cannot prove. It is important to us that NutPile be as flexible and approachable as possible. </p><p>In terms of affiliates, NutPile is a great addition for IoT and black boxes for various industries, devices which absolutely count on their Internet connectivity being highly reliable. </p><p>NutPile could potentially make arrangements with (US based) affiliates, developers who wish to add the agent into their products and/or services in order to give their own customers an additional tool which helps them to monitor their Internet services.</p><p>Personally, I envision the possibility of some developer communities wanting to add NutPile into their base code and working with us as an affiliate to do so. Those affiliate earnings could be used to do things for their communities, to help expand their work, perhaps subsidize adding features and/or support. </p><p>I don&#039;t know really since mainly, we just wanted to say thanks to the OpenWrt community since we do use the OS.</p><p>JB</p>									</div>
