					<p>Now I have just built and flashed trunk and I have got both radios.</p><p>Does this mean that 15.05 support for this router is incomplete? From the wiki I understood that images are available since BB 14 ...</p><p>One more question: where is the 128MB Flash? It looks like I have only 16MB free which is half of what I get with my old Buffalo router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>haydude</strong> on 7 Feb 2016, 22:08)</p>
