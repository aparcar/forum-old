					<p>Forgive me if this has been asked here before..I had too many results when trying to search and nothing useful.</p><p>I have a D-Link DIR-615 router.&nbsp; I connect to it with a laptop and it works fine if I am just a few feet away, but once I start to walk around in the building I dropped packets.&nbsp; I basically just let it ping for about a minute.&nbsp; I see like 47% just a few offices down from the router.&nbsp; It is going through a few wall.&nbsp; However, my phone and my other router show zero dropped packets at the same length.</p><p>Why are these packets dropped?&nbsp; Is this a problem with my hardware, OpenWRT or some config setting?&nbsp; How can I get the best distance with OpenWRT?</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
