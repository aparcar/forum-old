					<p>Hi all, been using linux for 2 years now, loving that anything is possible!</p><p>I just installed Kamikaze 8.09 on my brothers wrt54gs. Works so far. I am trying to set up a cron job to run a script that will run wol when it sees the ps3 to start a media drive, but not sure if cron is enabled (or is already or if I&#039;m having a problem [bug]). </p><p>I ssh into the router and go into /etc and crontabs is in there, but when I open it with vi it&#039;s blank and says it&#039;s not a regular file, and when I try to quit (:wq) it comes up with a message that says crontabs is a folder (and I tried to cd into it to check, no go). Is this a bug? or do I just have to replace that crontabs file with a new one? </p><p>I want to be really cautious and not brick it since it&#039;s my bros, so I wanted to check with the group.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok made a little headway, but still not fully working.</p><p>I ran crontab -e which created /etc/crontabs/root which I put:</p><p>1 * * * * /usr/bin/wol -p 9 -i ipa.ddr.e.ss 11:22:33:44:55:66&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #-p 9=UDP port</p><p>.... ok maybe a little working, it started up after about 10 minutes of nothing. not sure why so long... and then the NAS shut down again. Not sure if wol works the same as wakeonlan in the debian repos,&nbsp; cause that works great, it kept the NAS up. Can I port wakeonlan to Kamikaze? Going to have to look into it more after work.</p>									</div>
