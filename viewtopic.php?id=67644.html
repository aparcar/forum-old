					<p><span class="bbu">Note:</span> The following two questions are not OpenWrt specific, but given the inclusion of fq_codel in OpenWrt, which has made it an important part of reducing buffer bloat on the Internet, I suspect there may be some interest in the topic.</p><p><span class="bbu">Question #1:</span> Is it still effective to run fq_codel on an intermediate router when I have a WiFi uplink to the Internet, instead of a cabled connection like ADSL?</p><p><span class="bbu">Question #2:</span> Assuming the answer to Question #1 is &quot;yes&quot;, isn&#039;t it then better to have a guaranteed speed from the ISP, instead of having a variable but potentially higher speed, so that I can control the queue and have fq_codel and HTB prioritization work effectively?</p><p><span class="bbu">Background:</span></p><p>I manage the network for a camp / conference center that supports up to about 120 users (up to 5-10 simultaneous, at times). For Internet, we&#039;ve been using ADSL with 5 Mbit download, 0.4 Mbit upload (yeah, I know it&#039;s slow), and the only thing that keeps it usable is running fq_codel on a transparent Linux bridge that sits between the LAN and ADSL modem. On this bridge, I restrict the upload and download rate to about 85-90% of the maximum numbers, and use fq_codel (plus other HTB prioritization rules), and the latency at least is <strong>much</strong> better. It looks like this:</p><p>LAN &lt;=&gt; Linux bridge with fq_codel &lt;=&gt; ADSL Modem 0.4 / 5.0 Mbps &lt;=&gt; DSLAM ...</p><p>But now, we have a chance to improve our throughput problem by switching to a long-range WiFi uplink that could hit speeds of 30-40 Mbit symmetric (more on the speeds later). It would look something like:</p><p>LAN &lt;=&gt; Linux bridge with fq_codel &lt;=&gt; WiFi Client (Mikrotik 802.11n MIMO 2x2) &lt;=&gt; WiFi AP from ISP ...</p><p>We already have a test setup in place. The link rate to the ISP&#039;s AP, as reported by Mikrotik&#039;s admin console, is currently 86.6 Mbps Tx and 144.4 Mbps Rx, with CCQ (connection quality) at 64% Tx / 99% Rx. First of all, I&#039;ll try to have them get that Tx CCQ up to 90+ % like the Tx, to make sure it&#039;s a stable link. But I also know that the actual throughput will be less than that, and speedtest.net results are currently around 30-40 Mbps.</p><p>Moreover, it&#039;s WiFi, and that led to my Question #1. I know that latency and throughput can vary, and that there are more queues and more things happening with packet aggregation, etc that I do not understand. Can this aspect of the variable latency, throughput and packet transmission characteristics of WiFi make fq_codel less effective when used in this way on an intermediate bridge or router, or does more depend on the quality of the WiFi link?</p><p>My Question #2 came from the fact that I have two options from the ISP:</p><p><span class="bbu">Option A:</span></p><p>We can choose something like a maximum of 40/40 Mbit with 1:5 aggregation, meaning we could get 40 Mbit, but we could also get a lot less at times (8 Mbit I assume), depending on the conditions of their network.</p><p><span class="bbu">Option B</span></p><p>We can get a guaranteed bandwidth, but it costs more, so the maximum throughput we can pay for would be less. We would probably choose around 6/6 Mbit off-season, and 20/20 Mbit on-season, as the camp is a seasonal business.</p><p>My feeling, assuming that the answer to Question #1 is &quot;yes&quot; and I can effectively do HTB prioritization and fq_codel at all with WiFi, is to go with Option B, the guaranteed bandwidth. That way, I could set fq_codel to a little less than this bandwidth, and hopefully manage buffer bloat and do HTB prioritization in the same way I do now. But it depends on the answers to my two questions, is fq_codel still effective when using a WiFi uplink in general, and if so, is it better to go with a guaranteed bandwidth.</p><p>Thanks for any thoughts on this.</p>									</div>
