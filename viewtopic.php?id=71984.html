					<p>Hi</p><p>I am new to openwrt, but need to try understand some things.</p><p>I have flashed my RB750 and her openWRT running. I am confused with the default setup.</p><p>on the switch screen I see a CPU port and only 4 other ports, my RB750 has 5 physical ports,<br />Are vlans always required, what is If just want a five ports switch and just assign a ip tp port 1</p><p>Finally is it possible to setup each physical port as a ethernet adapter eth0, eth1, eth2 etc....</p>									</div>

					<p>On some devices, the WAN port is connected directly to the CPU, so you have eth0 for the switch and eth1 for the WAN port (or viceversa).</p><p>Using VLANs will create interfaces like eth0.1, eth0.2, ...</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply. <br />So one cannot change that config. WAN must remain as cpu. </p><p>Is it possible to just use the switch without vlans?<br />Can you make the wan Port part of the switch so you just have a&nbsp; 5 ports switch?<br />Can each port be a lan interface eth0 eth1 etc?<br />How do you assign those physical ports to their interfaces et0 etc</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want all 5 ports in the LAN, just move both Ethernet interfaces into the LAN network bridge (Network - interfaces - LAN - physical settings in the web configuration).&nbsp; You can then delete the WAN network since you&#039;re not using it.</p><p>If you want to be able to attach the 4 &quot;LAN&quot; ports to different networks, like eduperez said, set up the switch (Network - Switch) with VLANs.&nbsp; They should be tagged to the CPU and untagged to the respective physical port(s).&nbsp; Each physical port must be &quot;untagged&quot; in only one VLAN and &quot;off&quot; in all the others.&nbsp; After setting this up, a network that uses eth0.1 will go to the cable number 1 and only to that cable, as if there were multiple CPU ports.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Sep 2017, 07:55)</p>
