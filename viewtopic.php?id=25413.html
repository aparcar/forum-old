					<p>Here is what I want to do -</p><p>- Change the TinyProxy version with a version that I have modified that adds some functionality that I need.</p><p>- I have been able to compile my code using the SDK, and I have been able to generate a new .ipk</p><p>- I am using the PacketProtector spin of OpenWRT (so I have a USB file system mounted on my router)</p><p>- I have copied my .ipk to the USB and rebooted my router. I connect via SSH (as root) and execute the following command:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install MyHackedTinyProxy.ipk</p><p>However I get the following error:<br />&gt; Collected errors:<br />&gt;&nbsp; * pkg_hash_fetch_best_installation_candidate: Packages for tinyproxy found, but incompatible with the architectures configured<br />&gt;&nbsp; * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package tinyproxy.</p><p>In order to confirm that my code was &quot;really&quot; incompatible (i.e. some issue with my cross compilation environment), I downloaded a TinyProxy .ipk from the link below:<br /><a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/snapshots/brcm-2.4/packages/">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz â€¦ /packages/</a></p><p>But I get the SAME error!</p><p>So that means I am doing something obviously wrong at the basic level... But can not figure out what the issue may be. Any help will be appreciated.</p><p>-CGS</p>									</div>

					<p>The architecure names where changed from cpu arch to boardname after 8.09, e.g. what formerly was &quot;mipsel&quot; is &quot;brcm-2.4&quot; now.<br />The 8.09 SDK uses old style arch names while trunk expects new style ones.</p><p>You can add such a line to opkg.conf:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>arch mipsel 100</code></pre></div><p>This will make the trunk opkg also accept packages made for &quot;mipsel&quot;.</p>									</div>
