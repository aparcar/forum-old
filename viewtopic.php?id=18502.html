					<p>First post on this board, so I&#039;d like to say Hello to everyone first :-)</p><p>I&#039;ve been going through a steep learning curve to get a fonera up and running on my little home network...</p><p>After lots of research I&#039;ve managed to build a rs232 level converter and flashed the fonera with kamikaze 7.09 via serial console (all of which was new to me)</p><p>I would now appreciate some help in getting it set up. I have a 4 port hub with a windows PC, dbox and NAS storage for media setup. I want to add the fonera to provide access to the Internet and my home network for my newly acquired iphone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> (also have plans to share my NAS storage with one of my neighbours, but lets learn to walk first <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> )</p><p>I&#039;ve only managed to ping the fonera from the PC once.. but thats it. All the communication has been through serial. I have managed to enable wireless, and can see it from my iphone, but cannot access the net through it.</p><p>As I am completely new to this i&#039;d like to know how to set it all up? I am a little confused by the Lan &amp; Wan port settings (since it only has one port). How do i set this?</p><p>Should kamikaze have a http interface by default? if i could get this working I imagine it would make the rest of the setting up a lot easier.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have kamikaze 8.09 rc1 running, you should have the luci web interface installed on port 80.<br />Since the basic fonera has only on ethernet port, you have to decide, how to use it (lan or wan). The default configuration is lan!<br />Using it as a router would work, but since it has only two network interfaces, and most internet connections are wired (adsl modems, ...), this will not permit wired clients in your home.<br />If you already have a adsl router (or equivalent), you can bridge lan &amp; wireless, and use the fonera as a simple access point for your wireless clients.</p><p>By the way, flashing a newer fonera is very simple with the tools provided bei freifunk.net (for Windows and Linux), even if you want to use your own firmware images.

					<p>well after a bit more searching i&#039;ve added the line <strong>option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge</strong> to /etc/config/wireless (thanks to a member callled loswillios)</p><p>i&#039;ve now got the web interface up, which im chuffed about <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>and i can access my local network from my iphone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> all good so far!</p><p>now the final thing I think is down to the DNS server... I fudged it last time cos i wasnt too sure what i was doing. when i set up my router i ended up using perminant IP&#039;s and also assigning OpenDNS as my dns server for everything, which works great but i only did it cos i wasnt sure how to configure it properly in the first place. back to the search button!</p>									</div>

					<p>hmmm sure i replied to this thread again last night...</p><p>anyway i got it all working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> used dhcp so the dns took care of its self (still not sure how to configure it, but it works great now anyway)</p><p>Does anyone know how to set the time on the fonera? (i can do it via ssh, but thats pointless cos i dont want to be doing that after every boot up, can/should it pull the correct date/time from a server? (it still thinks its october last year)</p>									</div>

					<p>Install and configure ntpclient to get date &amp; time from a time server.<br />If you are using the fonera as a plain access piont, you can set the lan interface/bridge to dhcp and disable dnsmasq (dns &amp; dhcp server, with the command &quot;/etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable&quot;).</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks again for the reply. I tried to get the ntpclient installed the other night. Not really knowig what i was doing, should it simply be a case of typing: &quot;ipkg install ntpclient&quot; and hoping it will work? cos if thats all there is then it wont work. i presume i need to get the install package onto there first somehow? is there a decent guide somewhere, as the ones i&#039;ve found so far just say install it via the command above</p>									</div>
