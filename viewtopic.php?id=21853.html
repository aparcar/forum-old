					<p>Hi,</p><p>I tuned OpenWrt to handle a new router. But I did it in that way, that I compiled an image to similar device, made a modifications, that compiled it again. Thus I have a working image.</p><p>I want give my work back to the community, but I have no idea what is the workflow to prepare a patches to a new architecture.</p><p>Should I checkout a trunk from the SVN and apply existing patches to the arch manually to the linux kernel or there is some Makefile target to accomplish this?</p><p>Thanks,<br />dmg</p>									</div>

					<p>One path, is create a ticket about the problem solved.&nbsp; Then attach your patch to the ticket, and a developer will integrate it into trunk.&nbsp; If you are just occasional fixer this is simplest IMO.&nbsp; I dunno about becoming a more official developer for an architecture, sorry perhaps post to Developer forum.</p>									</div>
