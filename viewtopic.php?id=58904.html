I went ahead and downloaded the bin file from <a href="http://dl.eko.one.pl/barrier_breaker/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr843nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://dl.eko.one.pl/barrier_breaker/ar â€¦ actory.bin</a><br />I used this youtube video as a guide since both basically the same thing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmTv3ONy8Og">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmTv3ONy8Og</a></p><p>However upon reboot after install completion, I tried to open 192.168.1.1 only to find this error message.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Unable to launch the requested CGI program:

					<p>Problem solved itself today!!! <br />I kept trying this way flash openwrt -&gt;install Luci -&gt; revert to stock tp-link firmware until on the fourth time it just works after i finish installing. So I still didn&#039;t know what caused the problem with luci on the first 3 install. Right now It runs ok without porblem so far.</p><p>I wanted to use my router as dumb AP, and mount it somewhere on the wall without power outlet. so I needed openwrt to change the wan port acts as lan. this way I can use the POE feature and data transmission in one cable. It looks neat doing it this way. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
