					<p>I tried V4, V5, and V6.&nbsp; I used a hexeditor and deleted (ie removed from the file, not just cleared) everything before the HDR.&nbsp; I then (while in boot wait mode) TFTP -i 192.xxx.xxx.xxx PUT wrxxx.bin etc etc....It uploaded fine according to TFTP.&nbsp; I waited a couple of minutes and the router reset itself and appeared to function properly(asks for a login and password which is the typical motorola login which it accepts) except for the fact that I can&#039;t access the Motorola web interface.&nbsp; It comes up with the pink background and tries to redirect me to the screen but it is missing.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking that it has something to do with the reallocation of the bin when deleting the bits before the header.&nbsp; Anybody have any ideas or a copy of the bin or trx they used to flash to original?</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I&#039;ve decided to just stick with Openwrt so its not a big deal to get this answered.....the reason i wanted to flash back was because i have 2 wr850g&#039;s and i use one of them as a bridge...I prefer to use WPA and assumed it wouldnt be as big as a hassle when i installed openwrt....WEP seems to be working fine with bridge mode....and i dont believe i have any crackers around so i will stick with wep until i can get some extra time to setup wpa</p>									</div>
