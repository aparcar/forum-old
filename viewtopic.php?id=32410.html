					<p>Hello everyone, <br />This is my first post and I understand that I could have spent a little more time looking up for resolution to my problem before posting here but I can&#039;t seem to find a right one.<br />Some hours ago I flashed Dynalink RTA1025W ADSL wireless router with OpenWRT and managed to make some basic changes, editing /etc/config/... but I have no knowledge how to check what ports does the OpenWrt firmware discovers on that router.&nbsp; I do not need to use DSL capabilities of the router. I need to designate one of the four LAN ports as WAN port. As far as I understand I have to manage VLANs of those ports so one of the LAN ports should belong to a VLAN different than the other three LAN ports. The thing is I can&#039;t find where those &quot;VLAN to interface&quot; bindings are set in /etc/config/. <br />I hope I stated my problem correctly. I&#039;m really new to this logic of configuration but I believe that OpenWRT will become my favorite networking firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Zhekov</strong> on 15 Oct 2011, 01:21)</p>

					<p>That varies from device to device and on some its not possible at all. Paste the current /etc/config/network</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I guess I will retire this router and use it for spare parts. Or is it possible to use eth1 as WAN port and since the wireless is working, use it just for sharing internet with wireless clients only?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, just plug eth1 into your network and you got yourself a wireless bridge to extend your network.</p>									</div>
