Take a look at this benchmarks: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-4.7-FS-5-Way">https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page= … 7-FS-5-Way</a></p><p>Also, I think you can remove the&nbsp; kmod-fs-ntfs module and just let ntfs-3g handle everything. Also install ntfs-3g-utils so you can make some more tests, get info on the partitions, etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>@david Here&#039;s the IPTV howto. This is for me running on Bell Fibe in Canada, and includes IPTV and Internet. I&#039;ll add the general ideas behind the configuration:</p><p><strong>Software Requirements:</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>IGMPProxy</p></li></ul><p><strong>General idea behind the configuration</strong><br />This configuration&#039;s end goal boils down to the following:<br />1- Setup the switch to have two different vlans (One for Internet, one for TV) running on the appropriate Vlan IDs (For Bell Fibe in Canada, Internet runs on Vlan 35; and TV on Vlan 36). This could also be done on the same lan as your other devices, but then all your devices will get flooded with the multicast packets. Maybe not the best idea. Note that in the example below, my TV receiver is plugged into port #4. If you have more than one receiver, you can change the port assignment under the switches. TV Receivers on Wifi is not configured in this setup and will require manual investigation (I do not have wifi receivers).<br />2- There should be 6 total Interfaces: WAN (PPPoE runs over it), PPPoE (I named it PPPoE-Bell because of my ISP name, you can rename it if you&#039;d like), lan (My main Lan), TVLan (Self-explanatory) and TV (Vlan36 Wan). Main lan is set on 192.168.1.x while TV is set to 192.168.2.x. Note that I have to clone my ISP provided modem&#039;s MAC on the main LAN for my internet to work. <br />3- Added IGMP Proxy. Configuration is pretty self-explanatory. If you renamed the interfaces you&#039;ll need to modify this config as well.<br />4- (Depends on your ISP) Bell runs on IGMP v2, so I had to add this line into /etc/sysctl.conf:</p><p>net.ipv4.conf.all.force_igmp_version=2</p><p>You can find which version your TV provider runs on by listening on the TV Lan interface with tcpdump and check which IGMP version it runs on. You should see something like:</p><p>igmp v2 report</p><p>5- Added igmp_snooping option on the TV Lan interface<br />6- Setup the firewall to let everything from the TV Wan to go to the TV Lan (Not like you really gotta protect it, but in theory you could only allow UDP and Multicast. Up to you.<br />7- Find your default TV route. That&#039;s where this gets a little difficult. I notice that LEDE keeps the last DHCP lease gateway only. So you can probably work this in your favor by going under Interfaces and &#039;Connect&#039;ing the vlan 36 interface. This will kill your internet, but then if you route -n in SSH, you will be able to see your TV gateway. Add that gateway as a static route, reboot the router (Or reconnect your internet interface) and you&#039;re good to go.</p><p><strong>Configurations</strong></p><p>/etc/config/igmpproxy:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config igmpproxy

I&#039;ll add the general ideas behind the configuration:</p></blockquote></div><p>Great guide, farchord. It should make easy for anyone to make their IPTV work.</p><p>I&#039;d like to add just a couple of things. And, as I said before, I&#039;m no multicast expert, just an user with some years fighting with my IPTV <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>First. My TV (ethernet connected) is in the same VLAN as anything else at home. That way I can browse Internet (or any other Internet related thing). I think that IGMP snooping (forgive me if it isn&#039;t so) prevents multicast flooding in any other device not using IPTV. I never had a problem with this, and the TV kitchen (2.4 WiFi) can also watch our IPTV channels without troubling anything else.</p><p>Second. If you have problems with wireless clients you can use &quot;udpxy&quot;. Udpxy requires some configuration but once set up you can have all your multicast channels working through UDP, so no flooding. You can even create a playlist for a upnp server and distribute IPTV all around the house for any DLNA device. It may require some trial and error, but it works fine, at least if your ISP is not moving and changing channels frequently (as mine does...).</p><p>Just my 2 cents.</p><p>And again, congratulations and thanks for your guide,</p>									</div>
