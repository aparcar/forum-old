					<p>On the WRT1200AC the USB/eSATA port still doesn&#039;t work, but I have seen a few more WRT1200AC users on different FW&#039;s with the same problems. Also, with my WRT1200AC it doesn&#039;t always come up (with r48132 at least) with external storage attached to it, but again, this is more a WRT1200AC problem than anything else.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 7 Jan 2016, 16:54)</p>
