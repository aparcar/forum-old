					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Firstly I would like to thank all of the people that have contributed to this project,&nbsp; It is a wonderful tool.</p><p>I have written a couple of patches for my own needs and want to given them back to everyone.&nbsp; I am not sure of the contribution methods used for the project so I throw this out and let people tell me what I have done wrong.</p><p>The patches provide three pieces of functionality.&nbsp; They are grouped into one patch and included below.&nbsp; The functionality patches is as follows:</p><p>1.) Timezone support:&nbsp; Gives the ability to define a timezone to the initial firmware build and configure that timezone from the menu configuration.&nbsp; (It appears in the Runtime Configuration Menu)</p><p>2.) Inital User Support:&nbsp; Allows an initial root user and an additional user to be defined in the configuration menus to be included in the firmware.&nbsp; This ensures that even in failsafe mode, no un-authenticated access to the router even via the serial port.&nbsp; This option is again available on the Runtime Configuration menu of the build menus.&nbsp; It is disabled by default</p><p>3.) Copy /etc tree:&nbsp; This copies the /etc instead of using symlinks back to the rom.&nbsp; It only applies to the squashfs-based firmware versions.&nbsp; Useful for making user support work out of the box and other customiztions to the /etc tree.</p><p>-----------------<br />Edit #1: Added /etc copy and updated patch</p>									</div>
