That is done by OEM, Openwrt and LEDE firmwares. So flashing always overwrites the other firmware.</p><p>Having the file system quite full sounds unlikely, but you are likely reading the df output wrongly. flashed firmware is in /rom and is 100% used, while the free space is allocated as /overlay, into which all your settings changes etc. get written.</p><p>You might reboot the device once, if youget strange file system errors.</p><p>One approach for you would be to first switch boot to the other firmware, boot from that, and then flash from that firmware to overwrite this LEDE partition.
