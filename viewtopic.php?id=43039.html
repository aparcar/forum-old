If your patch is there, it should get applied.</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi hnyman,</p><p>The patch is being applied after running make from top directory. I went to the path you mentioned and&nbsp; the files that supposed to be patched indeed they&#039;re <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />!! What&#039;s more with the command you provide in your EDIT, I can see that the patch is applied too.</p><p>One last quesion, now all the firmware images which are&nbsp; created incorporate my patch rigth?</p><p>Thanks for all your help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ndarkness</strong> on 26 Mar 2013, 11:05)</p>
