					<p>Its either way. The point is: Its just not right to put months of development time in some software and submit it to a contest and then a company without even doing a keystroke has this product written by you with their copyright under it and if you don&#039;t win the contest as one of the 5 people who get some money then they got it all for free.</p><p>This is very different to working for some company and then submitting it as (c) the company.</p><p>Also it was only one of the aspects of my post above.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 27 Feb 2009, 23:29)</p>

					<p>While it does look like they are asking for someone else to do the heavy lifting without having to hire a bunch of 1099&#039;s to do the coding, their heart seems to be in the middle ground of making money off FOSS while also respecting it&#039;s open source.

					<p>Plenty of companies do that heavy lifting of creating GUI on top of OpenWRT (Netgear did with the WNR2000 router), and do NOT release it to open source!</p><p>I suspect they will do nothing more than make all the tarballs available for download.&nbsp; Of course, the license would allow any willing entrant to release his own copy right away to OpenWRT on August 18, 2009 (as any competition would have missed the deadline).</p><p>The negative responses here so far make it seem like everyone thinks $160,000 is chump change.&nbsp; People do work for contests all the time that don&#039;t pay off.&nbsp; In this one, their work gets donated to Open Source no matter if they finish it or not.</p><p>Is everyone unclear on the fact this could be built on top of existing interface projects like X-WRT (GPL license), Gargoyle (GPL License) and LuCI (Apache license)?&nbsp; Let alone the already excellent work completed by OpenWRT on the ar71xx platform.&nbsp; One person with the right skills should be able to do this in a few months of labor... and&nbsp; they can utilize any improvements or changes to OpenWRT up until August 17, 2009 deadline.</p><p>Of course, if you put the minimal work into it, only just adapt an existing interface with the required new features - are you likely to win the contest?&nbsp; Competition can sometimes create great work out of people - give it a chance.</p><p>How about we start asking other companies to join in and add to the prizes?&nbsp; Say $20,000 to boost second place, etc.&nbsp; Or agrees to <strong>independently judge all the submitted entries and award $20,000 to the one they think is best</strong>.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoundSparrow</strong> on 1 Mar 2009, 00:13)</p>
