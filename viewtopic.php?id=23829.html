					<p>Please let me know if this is the wrong thread/need to start a separate thread for this question:&nbsp; How/what do I need to do to revert back to my factory firmware on my Netgear WNR854T router? </p><p>First - installed no problems and was able to log right into the management page. I fully understand this is a beta, and so checked out the features, etc. However, wireless is not yet completed, so decided to revert back to my factory firmware. However, from the admin firmware update page, I selected my factory .img file, but get an error that the file type is not right and I should make sure I use a basic one.... I have made a serial to usb cable for this router and so put it into boot wait mode, and then pushed the factory firmware via tftp. That uploads fine and then begins to execute, but right after jffs2 loads the boot image, it gives me the &quot;Bad Magic Number&quot; and then hangs there... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; </p><p>Appears that loading this squashfs based file system has repartitioned the drives differently so the factory image won&#039;t boot? Anyway, if anyone can provide the steps or a link on how to reload a factory image after installing this openwrt firmware on this Netgear WNR854T router it would be much appreciated!</p>									</div>
