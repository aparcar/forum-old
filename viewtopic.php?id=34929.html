					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>first of all, I switched from DD-WRT to OpenWRT in order to user the router as both VPN server and IPv6 gateway (hope this will work, though).<br />Anyway, I use a DIR-300 from D-Link (Rev A), and the flashing process worked quite well (after some difficulties to access redboot).<br />But whenever I trigger a reboot, the image file won&#039;t load. I have a ping -t running in order to monitor when the router is up again, but it runs for 10 minutes without any &quot;pong&quot; coming back.<br />when accessing redboot and executing</p><p>fis load -l vmlinux.bin.17<br />exec</p><p> manually, it loads after some couple of seconds without the slightest problem.</p><p>I was doing everything according to the official documentation here on OpenWRT.com. Where&#039;s the problem? did I miss something?</p><p>Regards</p><p>ZeroEnna</p>									</div>
