					<p>When compiling any OpenWRT package that uses one of any cvs, git, and/or svn PROTO to retrieve the source files from their respective server, I notice OpenWRT removes all the CVS, .git, and/or .svn files/directories that contain some backup files. This is good to size down the package. However, I sure would like to see if there is an opt-out option so that the source package will retain all those CVS, .git, and/or .svn files/directories. This way, I can add a line in my OpenWRT Makefile to check and/or retrieve ONLY the differences when I compile my package.</p>									</div>
