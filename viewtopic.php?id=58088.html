					<p>Other approach might be to figure out the Openwrt release that the OEM firmware is based on, and then copy the opkg binary itself from the corresponding release here. That could probably be used to install packages.</p><p>And naturally, if you have access to the router&#039;s console, you can just emulate the installing process by copying files there via scp, ftp or whatever. </p><p>But in general, it is rather difficult to install any kernel-related binaries to a private firmware. And most programs should need to be compiled for the same kernel version etc. Likely something breaks down if you install external packages. So, even if you could manage to get opkg working, it might not bring you the benefits that you expect.</p><p>Thus Max Hopper&#039;s advice sounds pretty good.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would not consider an NTP client bloat, especially when it is shipped as busybox applet, it hardly uses resident memory or additional disk space then as the busybox binary itself already is resident in memory due to to e.g. crond. Modern crypto stuff, DNSSec etc. also depends on a correct time.</p><p>The real cause of recent bloat is the kernel which keeps getting fatter every time and the introduction of IPv6 by default.</p>									</div>
