					<p>Hey guys, </p><p>I&#039;m trying to install and configure Asterisk on BB on my Asus RT-N65U and need some help desperately. <br />I&#039;ve already tried for roughly 4 hours now but couldn&#039;t solve it. </p><p>I&#039;m running version 14.07 now, logged in via SSH and</p><p>#opkg install asterisk18</p><p>Apparently the dependency libopenssl was missing which I wasn&#039;t able to find anywhere. <br />After checking the opkg syntax I overrid it and installed anyways. </p><p>Starting asterisk gave me the same error (libssl missing)<br />asterisk: can&#039;t load library &#039;libssl.so.1.0.0&#039;</p><p>After another research, I found a package in the trunk which I installed. Trying for # asterisk -r I got:<br />asterisk: can&#039;t load library &#039;libc.so&#039;</p><p>Someone posted that libc.so is part of the glibc package which I tried to install, encountering:<br />Configuring libopenssl.<br />//usr/lib/opkg/info/libopenssl.postinst: line 4: default_postinst: not found<br />Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package glibc.<br /> * pkg_run_script: package &quot;libopenssl&quot; postinst script returned status 127.<br /> * opkg_configure: libopenssl.postinst returned 127.</p><p>I&#039;m now all out of ideas. Am I missing something? Any help is much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>You sir just gave the hint. <br />As mentioned earlier, I couldn&#039;t find the openssl package except in trunk. Apparently I made a typo when searching. <br />I&#039;ve just installed it manually and now it seems to be working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The reason I installed 1.8 was because that is the version mentioned on openWrt&#039;s How to. I haven&#039;t found a sign that it already has predecessors. Thanks for the additional hint! Problem solved.</p>									</div>

					<p>great to hear that everything is working now.</p><p>just be &quot;careful&quot; with the trunk files with older openwrt versions.<br />Currently the trunk is using for compiling another toolchain with musl.<br />The older versions are all with uclibc c-library<br />Also the kernel may be a different one and then the files are also not working.</p><p>This was then the problem for you. The files are just not compatible</p>									</div>
