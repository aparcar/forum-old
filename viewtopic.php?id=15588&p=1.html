					<p>The serial console state of a CYT based ATA device is governed by the <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19671425-">CONSOLE_STATE</a> variable. Chances are this <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19671425-">CONSOLE_STATE</a> variable on your device is set to <em>locked</em> to prevent anyone to access its serial-console port. If your device is not factory locked to any specific VoSP, you can easily issue a telnet and/or ssh login into the device (if it does have a dropbear support) and use the <em>setenv</em> command to set the <em>CONSOLE_STATE</em> variable to <em>unlocked</em> as seen <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19703226-">here</a> so that you can access its serial-console port.

					<p>After using the secret CGI commands to get into the bootloader, the next challenge is to get into userspace on this device.</p><p>It seems there is a recovery image, but no obvious means to get into it.</p><p>However, looking at the u-boot source code provided by Linksys (due to my reporting the lack of such to Wolfgang Denk, the U-Boot copyright holder, and his subsequent effort to get Linksys to put up the sources), there is some code in common/cmd_bootm.c which deals with the boot_image environment variable.</p><p>The code there checks for the existence of a valid &quot;full_image&quot; (the normal kernel and rootfs) and boots that if it finds one.</p><p>If it doesn&#039;t find one, then it boots a &quot;half_image&quot; (which seems to be a recovery filesystem).</p><p>Luckily, there is some test code left over in that function, which examines an &quot;owen_15_test&quot; environment variable, and if this variable is set to &quot;h&quot; then it unconditionally boots the half_image.</p><p>Booting the half_image gets you a busybox shell, with full networking available, including the &#039;wget&#039; command :-)</p><p>-- Rod</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, here&#039;s how to use the recovery tftpd server, once you have a serial port attached and have managed to unlock the console:</p><p>At the U-Boot console, type:</p><p>&nbsp; setenv shadow_data admin:XkRnx5gdf6RdQ:0:0:99999:7:::<br />&nbsp; setenv owen_15_test h<br />&nbsp; boot</p><p>This will boot a recovery shell, with the tftpd server running, with an admin password set to &#039;admin&#039;.</p><p>You can then use your favourite linksys-tftp client to upload a new cybertan_half_bin or cybertan_rom_bin image (see <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/WRP400/EncapsulatedFirmware">http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/WRP400/ … edFirmware</a> for details of what these are).&nbsp; I expect you can also upload a uboot.bin file, but I&#039;m not going to try that unless there is no other way to continue the investigation.</p><p>-- Rod</p>									</div>
