					<p>Hi there, I need to tag one vlan&#039;s outgoing frames with 802.1p priorities. I used to do this in dd-wrt:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip link add link eth0 name vlan20 type vlan id 20 egress-qos-map 0:4 1:4 2:4 3:4 4:4 5:4 6:4 7:4 ingress-qos-map 0:4 1:4 2:4 3:4 4:4 5:4 6:4 7:4</code></pre></div><p>but that doesn&#039;t seem supported by OpenWrt (or at least my hardware). I&#039;ve also read that vconfig can be used to specify the priorities, but my distribution of OpenWrt doesn&#039;t seem to have vconfig either (but it&#039;s a &quot;current utility&quot; according to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking/network.interfaces).">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking â€¦ terfaces).</a></p><p>I&#039;m using a Linksys WRT1900ACS on Designated Driver r49377.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lowjoel</strong> on 22 May 2016, 17:29)</p>

					<p>hello, if you are using an image trunk VLANs are disabled by default in the ACS. I recommend you go to the official thread and download some imgen of David502 or mrfreezee.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>roberto_MCF</strong> on 22 May 2016, 19:40)</p>

					<p>Thanks Roberto.</p><p>Reading the different build descriptions, none of them explicitly say that VLAN tagging is enabled in their builds.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s necessarily the problem since I am currently connected to the VLAN via tagged Ethernet frames. I just need to ensure the 802.1p field is marked with the correct priority, otherwise my ISP will drop all those frames in that VLAN.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if that would help. You should find ways to verify that the command does work -- an ifconfig would be useful. OpenWrt works for me, it should work for you too. The focus should be on figuring out what does not work and fixing that instead.</p><p>Note that after the VLAN is established, the Mio box requires a separate vlan and a bridge to force the traffic to have the correct QoS tag.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh -- another thing. If it&#039;s the BCM47xx chipset, that router requires a custom built kernel because the VLAN support is restricted from 0-15 in the default builds.</p>									</div>
