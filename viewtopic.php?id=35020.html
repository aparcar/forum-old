					<p>NEWBE...<br />I have a number of old Motorola SB100&#039;s - Broadcom BCM3350 controller (intergrated MIPS R3000 CPU) 2Mb flash 16Mb sdram.<br />I believe having read through a raft of information the SB100 is a no goer due to the lack of flash, just a thought - might it be possible to have boot code in flash and then load the OS from either the ethernet port or USB?<br />My final application, if it is possibel will require a USB sound card to anylise the audio output of a HF receiver and then output a JPEG image to a webserver via the ethernet port.<br />Just thinking out loud at this stage, and seems a shame to just dump the SB100&#039;s which at this stage seem to be a possibility in terms of hardware platform - but then again maybe thats just newbe talk...<br />Regards one and all<br />Simon...</p>									</div>

					<p>Many thanks for your reply, just spotted my first newbe mistake in my posting - it should have read I have a number of old Motorola SB4100&#039;s<br />though the at least I got the IC lineup correct (Broadcom BCM3350 controller (intergrated MIPS R3000 CPU) 2Mb flash 16Mb sdram).<br />Much more reading on my part now (not to forgetting of course next time to read through my own posting before submitting it)...<br />Regards,<br />Si.</p>									</div>
