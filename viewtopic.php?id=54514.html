					<p>So, I picked up a v2 WRT54G last night, got it home, and tried flashing it. I went to 192.168.1.1&gt;Administration&gt;Firmware Upgrade, selected the desired firmware and hit the Upgrade button. I tried this many times with different firmware. I of course initially tried to flash with barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm47xx/legacy/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin&nbsp; Every time I tried and then clicked the &quot;Upgrade&quot; button the page would disappear and give me a screen that said &quot;Page not available&quot; and nothing would happen as far as the flashing goes. I could navigate through the whole menu structure but as soon as I tried to &quot;Upgrade&quot; firmware and hit the button, I would be immediately presented with the &quot;Page not available&quot; screen.</p><p>I tried using Chrome and IE 11 to do this. I also tried to reflash with the Linksys FW and still nothing. I did the 30/30/30 before I began to flash anything onto the router. I also did a normal reset after having the above stated issues for so long. Once I did that, it seemed to help as far as getting the &quot;Page not available&quot; screen.</p><p>What started happening was when I would select the desired FW and hit the &quot;Upgrade&quot; button, the progress bar would make it about 1/4 - 1/3 of the progress. the furthest I ever got was about the &quot;m&quot; in &quot;must&quot; where it says &quot;Upgrade must NOT be interrupted:&quot; under the progress bar. After each attempt of flashing this router I was able to go to 192.168.1.1 and be presented with the Linksys FW menu.</p><p>As a last ditch effort I tried to use tftp2. I had selected the FW I wanted to flash in tftp2, unplugged the router than immediately hit the &quot;Upgrade&quot; button and it would take all 10 attempts to do its thing and in the end, nothing was flashed. Should I increase this to 99 or something? This still isn&#039;t considered&nbsp; bricked is it? What will I need to do to get OpenWRT on here? Will all WRT54G v2&#039;s be like this or is this just an anomoly?</p><p>Thanks for all the help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Crazy8</strong> on 10 Dec 2014, 17:11)</p>

					<p>I assume you have read the wiki page, especially about halfway down about installation.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g</a><br />The description is not very clear but it appears that you need to start by installing an old brcm-2.4 version to get out of stock.</p><p>Trying to run BB on this hardware seems not a good idea.&nbsp; Stay with older versions, there&#039;s really no loss there since development on the WRT54 series has been inactive for a while.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes I have mk. I actually had that on my screen as I went through the process. I was not aware that BB was a bad idea though. By older versions I am assuming you mean something like Attitude Adjustment? If so, then all I need to complete this &quot;upgrade&quot; is:<br />attitude_adjustment/12.09/brcm47xx/generic/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin&nbsp; correct? There aren&#039;t any other special files or anything?</p><p>Thanks much</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes.&nbsp; You would flash the new bin via the old OpenWrt and that will replace/upgrade everything.</p>									</div>

					<p>You use the stock firmware to flash a really old brcm-2.4 version of OpenWrt, and boot that up.&nbsp; Then you use that firmware to flash a newer version-- such as the one you mentioned--, though it may be better to even go back as far as Backfire.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for clarifying that. I will try Backfire as you mentioned and then work my way up form there. Your thought is to flash...</p><p>Linksys---&gt;Backfire---&gt;Attitude Adjustment and not even bother with Barrier Breaker? Are there significant updates between AA and BB that are worth taking advantage of, or were the updates not quite that significant?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I got to play with it again last night and with some patience and further troubleshooting I ended up having to use DrayTek Router Tools to get OpenWRT Backfire onto the router. However, upgrading from Backfire to Attitude Adjustment is being difficult now. I already had a saved bin for Attitude Adjustment and that didn&#039;t work. I also downloaded a fresh copy of the file and tried that and got the same issue. I&#039;m getting the &quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot; error. Not sure why though. This may require the power of Google to see whats up with this issue now.</p><p>I may have figured this out already. I need to use the .trx file don&#039;t I?<br />/attitude_adjustment/12.09/brcm47xx/generic/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Crazy8</strong> on 11 Dec 2014, 15:39)</p>

					<p>Well I think I am getting the hang of working through some of these issues now.One thing I am wondering though, that I have noticed, is that the OpenWRT web interface is ridiculously slow. Is this normal? Is there anything I can/need/should do that will make it better? Do I just need to learn how to do everything through the command line?</p><p>Thanks again for the help.</p>									</div>
