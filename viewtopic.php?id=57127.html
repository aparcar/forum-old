					<p>Hello</p><p>I&#039;m out of ideas. I&#039;ve being trying to do a simple configuration, but I can&#039;t find the proper way to do it. I want to simply filter all traffic from the physical port 4 in such a way that:</p><p>A) WAN router (192.168.0.1)<br /> |<br />B) Openwrt wan port 192.168.0.2<br />|<br />C) OpenWrt LAN ports 1-3 (IPs 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.3)<br />|<br />D) OpenWrt LAN port 4 (external 4 port-switch, IPs 192.168.1.10- 192.168.1.14)</p><p>A, B and C are just normal WAN, TP-LINK router and internal LAN, as configured when fresh installed. C traffic is forwarded to A, etc.</p><p>The special part is D. I want to have it *not* forwarded to A. For example, if any equipment in network D tries to ping an Internet address, it fails. No internet address is allowed to connect to D addresses, either. But C must be able to talk to D and D must be able to talk to C.</p><p>There is no need at all to have D in the same network as C. I&#039;ve actually tried all configurations but can&#039;t get it done. I&#039;ve had to factory reset my router a few times.</p><p>I&#039;ve also mapped the actual ports to the logical ports as seen by the internal TP-LINK switch.</p><p>My main trouble is that when I define VLAN 3 in such a way that OpenWrt LAN port 4 is the only port available I can&#039;t get routing from anywhere to VLAN 3, nor from VLAN 3 to anywhere. If I create another interface and assign it to VLAN 3, I can ping it when inside OpenWRT, but I can&#039;t communicate with any other interface.</p><p>If I try to set the CPU port of VLAN 3 to tagged (or any combination of VLAN 1 and VLAN 2 CPU to tagged) I lose all LAN connections to the router. The only combinations i could find that doesn&#039;t block all LAN accesses is to to set only the desired port (4) as untagged for VLAN 3.</p><p>1) Is there a simple way to block all traffic originating from the router&#039;s ethernet port 4 so that it can&#039;t reach the WAN? If I understood it correctly, the only way to do this is to use a VLAN, so that I can use eth0.4 in a firewall rule. Is this correct?</p><p>2) How is the correct way to define another VLAN, VLAN 3, so that I can control which VLANs/LAN/WAN can talk among each other?</p><p>3) Somewhere in the docs and comments, I&#039;ve found that if you TAG the CPU port in a VLAN, all other VLANs should have the CPU tagged. For me it didn&#039;t work. Any combination of tagged CPU blocks all access from the LAN to the router. Does it realy need to have the CPU on the same VLAN for each to be &quot;routable&quot;?</p><p>4) Do I have to define another network address range for VLAN 3 for it to work? (I&#039;ve already tried, but could go no further).</p><p>5) The information&nbsp; no <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch</a> helps a little, but doesn&#039;t apply to the TP-Link Archer c7 v2. Does any one have more information on it?</p><p>Thank you for any hints</p>									</div>

					<p>You must create two VLAN&#039;s here, one for ports 1-3 (untagged) and CPU (tagged), and another one for port 4 (untagged) and CPU (tagged); let&#039;s call the first one VLAN8 and the second one VLAN9 (you choose your own numbers).</p><p>Once you do this, the eth0 interface becomes unusable; so you must move all your LAN configuration from eth0 to eth0.8. You need to &quot;save&quot; all your changes first, and then &quot;apply&quot; them, or your lock yourself out of the device.</p><p>Now it&#039;s up to you to decide what to do with eth0.9; from your description, I would configure it to a different IP range (192.168.2.x), and allow traffic from eth0.9 to eth0.8 and back, but not from eth0.9 to WAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have a look at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500#port_map">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500#port_map</a></p><p>Your device has a 7-port internal switch: ports 0 and 6 are connected to the CPU, and can be seen as eth1 and eth0, respectively; port 1 is labeled as WAN on the box; and ports 2 to 5 are labeled as LAN1 to LAN4 on the box.</p><p>In your current configuration, ports 1 and 6 are linked together, so the eth0 interface is linked to the WAN port; and ports 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 are linked together, so all LAN ports are linked to the eth1 interface. You do not need tagged VLANs here, because all traffic at each port is treated equal.</p><p>Now you want to separate LAN4 from the other LAN ports; but there is no other CPU port available, thus you have to &quot;split&quot; the interface you are using for your LAN now (notice that I mentioned eth0 in my post, but you are actually using eth1 for your LAN). You must create two VLANs here: one VLAN8 for ports 0 (tagged) and 5 (untagged), and one VLAN9 for ports 0 (tagged) and 2, 3, 4 (untagged); must be untagged on the LAN ports, because computers on the other side do not expect tagged traffic, and tagged on the CPU ports, distinguish what traffic belongs to what ports.</p><p>You will have now interface eth1, where you will receive all the untagged traffic; but your switch is configured to tag all traffic on that port, so you will receive nothing at all. On eth1.8 you will receive traffic belonging to VLAN8 (the LAN4 port), and on eth1.9 you will receive all traffic from VLAN9 (LAN1 to LAN3) ports. You must leave eth0 alone, as it is still untagged and linked to the WAN port, but all configuration for your LAN must be moved from eth0 to eth1.9; and now you have eth1.8 too, which you can configure as you wish.</p>									</div>
