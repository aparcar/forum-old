					<p>It might be that the gui is confusign the state there. In doubt simply reboot after creating the AP(-WDS) network and see if it still shows 2x Client networks.</p>									</div>

					<p>The second might also be unknown because it cannot associate to the ap due to bad wpa settings, to weak signal etc.<br />Also note that when running two networks on the same radio, they have to use the same channel, so you must set the channel to the one required by the client to connect to the AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it&#039;s not that.<br />If i create the client connection in first place, he establish perfectly - both routers in the same room.</p><p>when create the virtual AP, mode stays UNKOWN and after apply, move to client, like in pic above.</p>									</div>
