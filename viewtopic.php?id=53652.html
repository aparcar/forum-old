					<p>I&#039;ve got a wired (no radio) router that looks like a decent little device. Unfortunately, it&#039;s a TP-Link and the firmware is predictably pathetic. The SoC is a QCA (Atheros) 9533, which appears to be supported in Barrier Breaker. I&#039;m trying to get a serial connection in order to reliably flash OpenWRT builds, but I&#039;m failing miserably. With a multi-meter, I&#039;ve managed to identify VCC and GND, which leaves two pins for Tx/Rx or Rx/Tx. I&#039;ve tried both directions with no luck. I&#039;ve read of other TP-Link devices needing pull-ups between Tx and VCC. Tried it on both potential headers, no luck.</p><p>Here&#039;s a photo with various headers and nearby surface mount points labeled with voltages. Pins 2 &amp; 4 (from the left) are connected to the nearby pads (one side of R169 and C165; neither present). My hunch is that one or more of those missing components needs to be present for serial to work. I&#039;ve tried a 4.5k and 10k resistor across the R169 gap, but still no joy.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/IMG_2361-small_zpsb763d7dc.jpg" alt="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/IMG_2361-small_zpsb763d7dc.jpg" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brnt</strong> on 28 Oct 2014, 05:40)</p>

					<p>At idle Rx should be near 0V and Tx around 3V. I see that one is at 2.48, no doubt that that pin is Tx.<br />I your serial doesn&#039;t see anything, it may be because the voltage is too low for a 5V serial converter.<br />Try putting a 1K resistor in R163 and then other 1K resistor to Vcc (3.3V). <br />Theorically that will help a bit, a logical &#039;1&#039; will be 2.9V and a logical &#039;0&#039;&nbsp; will be 1.65V. Very high for a 0 but it coukd work.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/x232nc.png" alt="http://i61.tinypic.com/x232nc.png" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>I tried the two 1k resistors and still no luck. At another suggestion, I tried a solder bridge across R169 without any noticeable change. Below is another photo of the PCB that shows the traces more clearly. You can see R157 is missing if you follow the trace from the leftmost pin (#1) toward the CPU. R169 would connect the trace between the CPU and pin #2. R170 would connect that same trace to GND. The adjacent pads between R169 and R170 are connected.</p><p>Other folks have suggested (based on voltage readings) that pin #1 should be Rx and #2 should be Tx. If that&#039;s the case R157 missing could effectively make the serial connection read-only. The missing combination of Rs 169 and 170 would disable serial output.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions thus far. I&#039;m happy to keep trying things as long as anyone else is willing to keep suggesting them :-)</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/FullSizeRender_zpsdf85a6d2.jpg" alt="http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af308/diepiapaopolopo/FullSizeRender_zpsdf85a6d2.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m familiar with building my own firmware (including for the 841) and flashing it via various methods. I just hesitate to start that before I have uboot access. As I mentioned above, with this new router I get a uboot splash on initial startup, but nothing works at that stage of booting (i.e., no keyboard and no TFTP). I wonder if it&#039;s related to the router refusing to boot if my serial adapter is connected. Does anybody have an idea about either of those things?</p>									</div>
