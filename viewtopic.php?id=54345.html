					<p>Havn&#039;t tested this device, but other methods for reading temperature / other environmental measurements:</p><p>- 1 wire: DS18B20 or OW-ENV-THPL + DS9490R USB-to-1wire adapter + owfs<br />- WS2300 weatherstation + open2300</p><p>Notes:<br />- owfs has some flaws, but is working pretty well with the right countermeasures. Quite fast, compared to open2300.<br />- open2300: painfully slow. Reading the full content of the weatherstation takes somewhere between 3,5...5minutes. There are faster ways, but they are also more error prone.</p><p>To answer your question: Yes, USB port is alive by default.</p><p>Regarding TEMPer: Nice small device.<br />Found some info in the comments of a similar device (<a href="http://www.amazon.de/USB-Sensor-Thermograph-Thermometer-Temperatur/dp/B009RETJIO">http://www.amazon.de/USB-Sensor-Thermog … B009RETJIO</a>) -&gt; Someone uses it under debian with the following drivers Google: &quot;github petervojtek usb-thermometer&quot;)</p><p>If you manage to get this thing going with openwrt, please let us know!</p>									</div>

					<p>Sure, I would be happy to post my findings once I know more. <br />It just happens I have some of these TEMPer devices which is why I wanted to use one. <br />I don&#039;t need full weather station input, just the devices external temperature would be fun to know.</p><p>Interesting that the USB device is live.

Stop.’</p><p>This means that make could not understand much of anything about the makefile line it just read. GNU make looks for various separators (:, =, recipe prefix characters, etc.) to indicate what kind of line it’s parsing. This message means it couldn’t find a valid one.</p><p>One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or perhaps your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows editors) have attempted to indent your recipe lines with spaces instead of a tab character. In this case, make will use the second form of the error above. Remember that every line in the recipe must begin with a tab character (unless you set .RECIPEPREFIX; see Special Variables). Eight spaces do not count. See Rule Syntax.</p>									</div>
