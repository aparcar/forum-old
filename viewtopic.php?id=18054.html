					<p>Hi I use this board with an ARM926EJ@333MHz and U-boot. Right now I use it with an NFS mount and the ELDK toolkit. I&#039;d really like to port OpenWRT on it. </p><p>Two questions:<br />- how to I compile a &quot;standard&quot; ARM image to do some preliminary test<br />- what are the steps for a full porting of OpenWRT on it</p><p>Thanks!<br />Alessio</p>									</div>

					<p>I would suggest looking into the svn commits to see how a new platform gets added. What kind of board are we talking about?</p>									</div>

					<p>Kaloz, thanks for the answer.</p><p>It is a custom board we are working with, with a FPGA that emulates some hardware devices I am writing the drivers for.</p><p>Now, as I said we are using a NFS mounted ELDK ( <a href="http://www.denx.de">http://www.denx.de</a> ) Linux system for development, but I&#039;d really like to port this to openwrt. I&#039;ve been told on the IRC channel to create a generic ARM image and try that to see how it goes. The point is, I do not know how to enable the creation of an ARM image. Any hint in this direction? The moment it boots I will see how to customize the environment for specific patches that may be required, but I need a start on this. Are you on IRC maybe?</p><p>Thank you<br />Alessio</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I&#039;m on IRC. Given you are on an armv5, I would suggest starting from one of the xscale targets (iop/ixp).</p>									</div>
