					<p>You must have some sort of Internet connectivity, since you are writing here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>So how about sharing that connection to your router e.g. over Wi-fi, and using that to update the package lists and install necessary components? When facing an issue such as yours, I often share a mobile broadband connection from my mobile phone by setting up a Wi-fi AP on the phone and connecting the router as a client.</p><p>You should consult your ISPs tech support for the details of your VDSL connection. What line type, what annex mode, which transfer mode, what encapsulation it uses, what link layer components are necessary and so on and so forth. The more tech specs you can fish out from them, the better off you are. You will need these details in order to configure all the bells and whistles of OpenWRT / LEDE.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>BlondeSTallman wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Also does this vdsl.bin firmware come with the standard 17.02 LEDE software or do i need to install it somehow?</p></blockquote></div><p>Open an SSH connection to your router, and check the contents of &#039;/lib/firmware&#039; folder. Some LEDE images come with a pre-installed firmware file, others load this firmware from a hardcoded address on the flash memory. It all depends on the router, and how the LEDE image was built, and what license conditions cover the firmware file.</p><p>You should also check the make and model of your router. Linksys 1900AC does not sound correct. Perhaps you have a <a href="https://www.linksys.com/fi/p/P-XAC1900/">Linksys XAC1900 device</a>? The exact make and model are important, because it allows us to determine which ICs your router is using for the DSL connection. This makes a world of a difference.</p>									</div>

					<p>WRT1900AC sorry. I will talk to my ISP and try and get all the details. /lib/firmware was empty! so it seems i need the vdsl firmware still.</p><p>I&#039;ll try connecting the router and updating it too.</p><p>Update: I can&#039;t get it connected to the external internet. Connecting it via LAN to the routers WAN and LAN ports doesn&#039;t allow connectivity.

					<p>If it is a WRT1900AC, it means it does not have the ICs necessary to create a DSL connection. Therefore, you must have another device which acts as a modem. Which device is it?

If the other router has a local network and a DHCP server operating on the LAN ports, then things should work automatically. But if the other router is bridging the ISP&#039;s PPPoE link, then you&#039;ll need some additional configuration.</p><p>EDIT: Is <a href="https://www.linksys.com/ca/support-article?articleNum=135000">this</a> the setup that you&#039;re after?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 23 Sep 2017, 22:32)</p>

You could perhaps configure the Huawei device to act as a transparent Ethernet bridge, so the PPPoE link provided by your ISP runs through it, and is terminated at the WRT1900AC router. Then the Huawei would only be responsible for operating the DSL link, and Wi-fi &amp; PPPoE would be operated from the WRT1900AC.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>BlondeStallman wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Here is my Openwrt&#039;s current config:</p></blockquote></div><p>You will need to get the Huawei&#039;s configuration correct first.
