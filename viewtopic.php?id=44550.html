					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a custom package I have made what uses the postinst directive in the make file to issue a series of bash commands. This all works fine and does exactly what I want it to do.</p><p>My question is now that I have this package if i want to compile it into the image how and when is this script executed and if its executed at compile if there is effectivley no bash interface running at the time its compiled.</p><p>define Package/package/postinst<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #!/bin/sh<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uci add firewall rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci set firewall.@rule[-1].src=wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci set firewall.@rule[-1].src_ip=&lt;&lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci set firewall.@rule[-1].target=ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci set firewall.@rule[-1].proto=tcp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci set firewall.@rule[-1].dest_port=&lt;&lt;DEST_PORT&gt;&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci commit<br />endef</p><p>I have chosen to to just modify the firewall config file becasue I would like this package to work across future releases and dont want to have to manage my own firewall.conf when the standard one is going to be ok and it may change over new releases.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply. </p><p>I have come to the conclusion that the Preinst and Postinst are really only when utilising opkg from the router itself. meaning that they are good for some clean up operations etc but not really for applying settings to images. </p><p>Instead I have moved away from this and keep the changes that I make to other system files in my repository and copy them in before I run make.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want the firmware image to start with your own custom config files, you can save them in &lt;buildroot&gt;/files/.&nbsp; Your own custom firewall file for example, can be saved into &quot;&lt;buildroot&gt;/files/etc/config/firewall&quot;.
