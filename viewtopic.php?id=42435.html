					<p>So, I&#039;m starting to get nervous about WPA2 key strength.</p><p>WPA2 PSK text can be generated from the 95 &quot;ASCII Printable Characters&quot;:<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#Security">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Prot … s#Security</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCI … characters</a></p><p>The description in the first link explains the algorithm used to generate the key from the set of ASCII characters.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t sound as if that algorithm is used if you instead use 64 hex characters.&nbsp; Which means, for interoperability purposes, I can&#039;t really use the 64 hex character version (because of client devices that don&#039;t support it).</p><p>There was a post on the forum years ago about the documentation on the web site.&nbsp; The language is still here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless/encryption</a></p><p>By limiting WPA PSK keys to only using alphanumeric, we have really cut down on the possible keyspace.</p><p>Has uci&#039;s handling of the extended ASCII printable character space improved since the documentation been written?&nbsp; Since shell substitution is being done, it seems as though the string written out to the config file could just have shell special characters to be escaped.&nbsp; Can the uci command do the escaping for us?&nbsp; If not, how about Luci doing the escaping before it gets sent to uci?&nbsp; Maybe a little utility to take an ASCII printable character string on stdin (or command line) and put a properly shell quoted version on stdout?&nbsp; Would something like that be useful?&nbsp; Luci could call it before calling uci.&nbsp; (I could contribute something like that.)</p><p>Edit: I looked at this a bit, and it appears that /etc/config/wireless just needs the &#039; quoted, as it uses that as a delimeter.&nbsp; I played a bit with setting this string to different values using the uci command.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell if it is processing things correctly or not.&nbsp; For example, if I type:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].key=&quot;ihavelot&#039;sof&#039;squote&#039;s&quot;</code></pre></div><p>the file gets:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&#039;ihavelot&#039;\&#039;&#039;sof&#039;\&#039;&#039;squote&#039;\&#039;&#039;s&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I can&#039;t tell: maybe the string &#039;\&#039;&#039; is how you properly escape a &#039; for uci in its config files.</p><p>Normal shell things need to happen, like \&quot; and \$.</p><p>So, other than not being sure about how to properly quote &#039; in the uci config files, it appears that you can use more characters.&nbsp; On the command line, you have to escape the shell ones (&quot;, $, `, and \), which is understandable.</p><p>So maybe it is just the documentation that could be modified to make this clear.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kevbo_red</strong> on 21 Feb 2013, 06:35)</p>

					<p>Since the actual key is only 256 bits you don&#039;t really need to use weird characters.</p><p>if you use a-zA-z0-9.,&nbsp; that&#039;s 64 choices at each slot which means each character is 6 bits.

					<p>Yeah, 64 bit hex is enough to cover the keyspace.&nbsp; I was assuming the problem was interoperability with other devices.</p><p>From the Wikipedia article, it appears that if you use ASCII characters, there&#039;s somewhat of a &quot;standard&quot; of what you do with those bits to actually generate the key...some math, combining it with the SSID, etc.&nbsp; Once you go to 64 hex digits, it doesn&#039;t appear that you do that: your 64 hex digits are the key itself.</p><p>I&#039;m not positive if all devices actually do that...switch algorithm if you go to the 64th character, stop XORing with the SSID, etc.</p><p>I should probably experiment, at least with all of the devices that I have here (which consists of basically a couple of Android devices and a printer).</p><p>I&#039;ll post more once I&#039;ve done so.</p>									</div>

					<p>@kevbo_red&nbsp; &nbsp;if you&#039;re worried about interop, that&#039;s one thing.&nbsp; E.g. to be compliant as a client an OpenWRT device has to be confiigurable with any valid passphrase. (i.e. full 95 valid ascii chars.)</p><p>My message was addressing this: &quot; By limiting WPA PSK keys to only using alphanumeric, we have really cut down on the possible keyspace.&quot;</p><p>THAT, isn&#039;t true.&nbsp; 43 alphanumeric characters represent 256 bits.&nbsp; &nbsp; Throw in another couple to cover hashing collisions in SHA1.</p><p>So an alphanumeric key of 45 characters covers the whole key space.&nbsp; &nbsp; Using punctuation doesn&#039;t buy you anything but the abillity to use a slightly shorter key.</p><p>To put it aother way:&nbsp; A 10 character long password using any of the legal 95 ASCII values is ONLY as strong as an 11 character log password using only alphanumerics.&nbsp; (for short passwords there&#039;s something to be said for the order in which a brute force attacker would choose their passwords (e.g a dictionary attack) but for a 45 character random key that doesn&#039;t apply.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vhrm</strong> on 22 Feb 2013, 12:40)</p>
