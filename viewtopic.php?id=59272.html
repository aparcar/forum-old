					<p>Hi,</p><p>Around a year ago I successfully installed my first OpenWrt. Now I already migrated all my routers to OpenWrt. Also I gave second life to some of older unused&nbsp; routers thus avoiding some cable installations.<br />Totally I have four wireless routers. Two of them are main ones that are attached to public internet and working as firewalls too. One in my home and another in office.</p><p>While they are working more stable as original firmware ( at least I do not need restart them regularly ), they still has some problems.<br />For office one - looks like wireless loses some network information. It does not go off, but internet is lost (no pings to DNS etc.) Wireless connections disconnect &amp; connect on PC helps for that.<br />For home one - after some couple of months of successful and nice working it started to drop speeds. As it looks like bufferbloat, I installed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">SQM</a>, that helped and now it is more stable. While it worked much better, I would like to be more informed what is happening in my router and network.<br />Also I have the question - why this problem appears only after a few monts?<br />Now I compared two pings to public internet - from router and from my PC within my LAN. While from router ping times was stable and small (within 3ms) my local pings was humpy-jumpy so that sometimes goes to thousands of milliseconds. </p><p>As there could be multiple reasons for the problems above (from my OpenWRT config to activities in my network), than I would like to find some ways/tools to quickly find the typical problems. Of course I would like to find out how to diagnose problems and better tune up my router - that is one part, but second is be informed about problems in my WAN (f.ex. call to provider - why so slow) connections and/or LAN (f.ex. ask kiddies why you are generating so much traffic or look for viruses etc.) connections. So I am also looking for some good monitoring and analyzing tools too.</p><p>I would appreciate some recommendations, links etc. from what to start from other users experience.</p><p>To make more narrow problems to solve I would start with my home router:<br />TP-Link model: TL-WDR4300 v.1.7<br />with<br />OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Janeks</p>									</div>
