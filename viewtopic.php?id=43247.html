					<p>No not really.</p><p> At the lowest level you need a radio capable of operating in the band you need. These wifi routers only work in the 2.4ghz band&nbsp; (and sometimes the 5ghz wifi band)</p><p>The way one of these routers could possibly be involved is if you found a linux supported USB&nbsp; zwave dongle&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and plugged it into a router with a USB port... and then somehow used the router as a controller... but that doesn&#039;t sound like something you&#039;re interested in.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt can help by providing a net-enabled means to access a microprocessor (usually through usb-serial) which can communicate with your 433mHz senders and receivers.</p>									</div>

					<p>as what lizby said, you can connect a usb-serial device to the router, and add a microcontroller to it. arduino is quite popular right now for this job.</p>									</div>
