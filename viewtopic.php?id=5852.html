					<p>I&#039;ve been playing with kamikaze/2.6 on my AP...</p><p>Here&#039;s a brief synopsis:</p><p>1.&nbsp; USB 2 is broken.&nbsp; The ehci_hcd module loads up, recognizes the hardware and anything plugged into the usb port.&nbsp; But any attempt to use usb results in errors, and eventual reboot (caused by a kernel puke?)&nbsp; (It&#039;s also broken in 2.4.)&nbsp; USB 1 works reliably, but s...l...o...w...l...y.&nbsp; This is really causing me some pain as I was hoping to use the bandwidth available with usb 2 for webcams, still cams, and data storage....&nbsp; If anyone is working on this, I will be happy to provide any testing they need.</p><p>2.&nbsp; With the 2.4 kernel, all three ethernet devices show up.&nbsp; (This AP has 3 separate eth transceivers.)&nbsp; With the 2.6 kernel, only eth0 and eth1 do.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t figured this one out; I&#039;ll do some more testing to see if this is a config or driver issue, and isolate which eth port is not working....</p><p>3.&nbsp; The Power light is blinking.&nbsp; I&#039;m either going to tape it over with black electrical tape or figure out how the !@#$%^&amp; GPIO work on this AP....</p><p>That&#039;s it for now.&nbsp; If I figure any of these out, I&#039;ll post.</p><p>--Yan+</p>									</div>
