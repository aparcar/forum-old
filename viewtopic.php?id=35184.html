					<p>Hey there, </p><p>I got this working, what you need to do is download the 12.09 (final?) AA build from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/rt305x/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … ps/rt305x/</a> or you could go for the bleeding edge at<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/</a></p><p>Choose the &quot;factory.bin&quot; version for your first flash (e.g, openwrt-ramips-rt305x-dir-615-d-squashfs-factory.bin version )<br />when you flash in the future you can choose the upgrade.bin</p><p>Go to your DLink Router, take the power plug out, and put&nbsp; &amp; hold a pin/paperclip into the reset button. <br />Put power on (keeping the paper clip in)<br />and the front light should start flashing orange in a couple of seconds.</p><p>At this point the router is in failsafe, emergency mode</p><p>On your PC (macs are similar though), set your IP Address to 192.168.0.10, subnet 255.255.255.0<br />From a browser (i used chrome and it worked fine, but I hear IE might be better), navigate to 192.168.0.1<br />This takes you to the &quot;emergency room - flash loader)&quot; website. At this point you can provide the factory.bin and voila flash away..</p><p>Leave it 5mins or so.. When the flashing is done the router will reboot and the lights will flash green. At this point reconfigure your PC to use DHCP and then navigate to 192.168.1.1 to access openwrt.</p><p>Should all work fine.. best of all the D-series are pretty much unbrickable as the emergency room bootloader is in rom (or something similar) not flash . .awesome</p><p>Let me know if this works for you</p>									</div>

					<p>This worked, many thanks asantaga.</p><p>At first I was like &quot;meh?&quot; cause chromium was just sitting there doing nothing being stuck at &quot;Uploading (0%)&quot; and timing out eventually after like 20 minutes or so.</p><p>But then I changed to iceweasel and all went fine.</p><p>Router is now running some real software :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I followed asantaga s instruction and it worked - no problems.<br />The part about an &quot;emergency room&quot; on the router is really cool and much easier than the tftp stuff I have been doing elsewhere.</p><p>I am trying to make the router connect to another wireless network, but it doesn&#039;t work - I am able to get wireless working as an ordinary access point, but not as client.</p><p>I try to &quot;scan&quot; in luci, but it finds nothing and on the command line in telnet &quot;iw dev wlan0 scan&quot; is empty also.<br />Have you tried and suceeded in this?<br />Could someone try this on the router - it should be a benign operation :-)</p><p>Any suggestion on what to test?</p><p>(next step is to recompile using bleeing edge...)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Moozer</p><p>Are you trying to make it into a bridge? ie connect to one wireless network and transmit it to another??? if so then no can do, I think its a hardware issue.</p><p>What you can do is make it into a repeater, with the same SSID name.... I got that working (I think).. I&#039;ll look for instructions when I get back...</p>									</div>
