					<p>Hot off my success testing the newly ported avalance ADSL driver with a 2.6 kernel, I am wondering what the prospects are for getting the ACX111 wireless chip running as a WPA-PSK access point.</p><p>On the ADSL driver discussion, Heini mentioned that it could only do WEP right now, which kind of ruins the point for me to replace the unstable firmware on my D-Link DSL-G604t.&nbsp; I guess I could switch to some VPN-over-nonrouted-wireless solution, but getting my wife or house guests to play along might be asking too much...</p><p>I also noticed that my settings in /etc/config/wireless do not seem to be applied to the ACX driver, so it is getting some default ESSID and sitting in station mode instead of master mode.&nbsp; I assume there is no need to chase after this issue yet, if the driver cannot get put into a WPA mode now anyway.</p>									</div>
