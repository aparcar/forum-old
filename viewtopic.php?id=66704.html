					<p>So, I wasn&#039;t getting any luck with the 3G dongle backup and decided to upgrade the firmware but TP-Link didn&#039;t list my hardware revision 1.2 and I went ahead and flashed the latest 1.0 firmware which bricked the router. </p><p>Can&#039;t get any data from serial and I&#039;ve plugged it directly to a motherboard serial pinout plus the well known USB to serial adapter. </p><p>It only shows the power led and flashes the switch with no DHCP,&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to track any calls for recovery through Wireshark but no luck. </p><p>Here is the weird behavior, after a while with a cable plugged in, the WiFi SSID will show up and I&#039;m able to connect and get the ip 192.168.1.100 from the DHCP server 192.168.1.1 but it doesn&#039;t respond to tftp, telnet, web or whatever and the ping is kinda high around 50-80ms.</p><p>Any thoughts? </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
