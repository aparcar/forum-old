					<p>I was, I admit, a little stubborn when starting development on the web interface about using php.&nbsp; I still think there are advantages in terms of widespread knowledge of php, but I&#039;m quickly coming around to the point of view that it is overkill.</p><p>Possible languages as I see it are</p><p>Ash - the advantage is this is already built in, the disadvantage is that there is a little bit of a round peg square hole issue since, of course, it is a shell scripting language.&nbsp; Not impossible, just possibly inefficient.</p><p>PHP - the advantages as I see it are universallity and a wide range of functions to use/backport in.&nbsp; the disadvantage is size and the truth is -- as i&#039;ve been coding the interface -- you don&#039;t really need very many functions to write a web interface, especially as you can tie in to shell tools for many things</p><p>Ember - this looks to be ideal. i&#039;m hardly the first to suggest it.&nbsp; my concern initially was that its not so widely known.&nbsp; my current thinking is that (a) i may be wrong about that, (b) regardless, the syntax is so easy that anyone knowing c/java/php could pick it up in about 8 seconds, (c) its size makes it worth it.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>i voted for php.<br />I think that it&#039;s much easier to code than. Apart from that, there may be some functions missing when you code the stuff in ash. In php, i know no function which I may miss.<br />And last but not last: There are lots of people who know php, and could help you. The second language I would vote for, would be ember. It really looks great. But I think that most people aren&#039;t willing to learn a new language, just for this webinterface coding. So I guess you won&#039;t get as much support as you would get by using php.</p><p>Cheers,<br />phil</p>									</div>

					<p>Take rkuris&#039; ash script and add a bunch of fields to it or put some long texts in the fields (say, 50 characters each). At some point, looks like about 128 characters in total for the post, basic.cgi just hangs. </p><p>Is there some busybox limitation that allows &#039;read&#039; to only handle 128 characters and hang when things get larger? Or am I just missing something stupid here?</p>									</div>
