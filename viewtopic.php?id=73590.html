					<p>I recently started using an &quot;extra OpenWrt&quot; router as a smart AP. That is the WAN ports are NOT connected. I wanted to be able to manage this AP using IPv6. I can easily add a static IPv6 address for the LAN interface to the /etc/config/network file:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
        option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;
        option &#039;ip6addr&#039; &#039;2001:DB8:1111:EFGH::2/64&#039;  # static IPv6 address</code></pre></div><p>But if I touch the config with LuCI (the web interface) the static IPv6 address for the LAN is removed. Is there a more correct way to assign a static IPv6 address to the LAN interface where LuCI won&#039;t remove it?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure combining ip6assign and ip6addr in one interface is a good idea. Maybe you should use ip6ifaceid instead of ip6addr.</p><p>Or add an alias interface (i.e. another interface with ifname set to br-lan) and configure the ipv6 address on that interfaces</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the ideas. Looks like ip6ifaceid is only used for PD (and this has no PD, as I am only using the LAN interface for management).</p><p>Tried creating a LAN6 in LuCI, and it looks like it should work, but when I ssh into the router (using link-local address) I don&#039;t see the assigned Global Address (GUA) to any of the interfaces. And I can&#039;t ping the GUA. </p><p>So I put the ip6addr back in the &#039;config interface lan&#039; section, and it works, I just have to remember not to edit that interface in LuCI. </p><p>It would be nice if LuCI had a blank for static IPv6 address in the LAN interface config, since the &#039;proto&#039; is STATIC.</p>									</div>

					<p>I configured openwrt to AP-mode and PC is supposed to get ipv6 and ping public ipv6 through openwrt. After configuring some files, PC can get public ipv6, but lan port cannot get ipv6 and in openwrt I cannot ping public ipv6. Also in PC I see the PC send the echo request but get no echo reply. Anything about icmpv6 that will be forwarded to outside will be discarded by openwrt, although icmpv6 outside can be accepted by this PC.
