					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Now I come across this problem: somehow the r/w speed of the disks attached to my 1900ac v2 drops to about 10m/s (one hdd and one tf card). Before it usually took a reboot for the speed to get back to 100m/s but now this trick stops working. I didn&#039;t do anything recently except changing the number of min_free_kbytes in system.conf. I changed it back to the old setting but the problem remains. The ethernet speed between other devices is still 100m/s so it&#039;s not the problem of the lan part. May I ask if it&#039;s related to the usb drivers?</p><p>PS: The firmware is cc 15.05.1</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>godsendpie</strong> on 20 Oct 2016, 10:57)</p>
