					<p>Hi, </p><p>I am running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 on a WZR-HP-G300nh. I am playing on hardening my firewall rules for some days now and I cannot find any information or figure out the problem I am having.</p><p>My router (192.168.11.1) is connected to a managed switch (192.168.11.2) and another router (192.168.11.3). The computers are connected to the managed switch. I am trying to connect from my computer (192.168.10.2) to the secondary router (192.168.11.3) on ports 80 and 22. The problem is that it only works if I allow all traffic from 192.168.11.3 to be routed to my 192.168.10.x network. But I only want to allow ESTABLISHED/RELATED to go to this .10 network.</p><p>Looking at the rules, I see (just pasting FORWARD rules):</p><p>Chain FORWARD (policy DROP 71 packets, 4372 bytes)<br /> pkts bytes target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt in&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />13854 5185K delegate_forward&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Chain delegate_forward (1 references)<br /> pkts bytes target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt in&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />13854 5185K forwarding_rule&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/* user chain for forwarding */<br />13344 5152K ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all&nbsp; --&nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; any&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED<br />&nbsp; 141&nbsp; 9709 zone_lan_forward&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; br-lan any&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.11.0/24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 zone_wan_forward&nbsp; all&nbsp; --&nbsp; eth1&nbsp; &nbsp;any&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />.....</p><p>In my limited understanding, the rule&nbsp; &quot;ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED&quot; should allow the SYN ACK packet to go back and stablish the connection. But in reality the package is being dropped:</p><p>Mon Aug 15 22:26:19 2016 kern.debug kernel: [&nbsp; 300.710000] Dropped fw:IN=br-lan OUT=br-lan MAC=00:1d:73:b3:e8:d6:00:18:39:c6:e0:ff:08:00 SRC=192.168.11.3 DST=192.168.10.2 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=63 ID=0 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=80 DPT=49242 WINDOW=5792 RES=0x00 ACK SYN URGP=0 </p><p>Reading about iptables on OpenWRT, I notice that conntrack is enabled by default only for connections using masquerade. So, I edited /etc/config/firewall, adding option conntrack &#039;1&#039; on all zones. But it still do not work.</p><p>Any help is appreciated, thanks.</p>									</div>
