					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to install OpenWRT on my WN2000RPT rev0, but apparently port 23 is not open and I can&#039;t enable telnet access. I tried every telnetenable utility there is, for Windows and Linux, old and new routers.</p><p>Is there any other way to flash the firmware without enabling telnet?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, i figured you could use the serial port.</p><p>But what cable do I need for this? I found two: USB to TTL and USB to UART RS232</p><p>Which one do I need?

					<p>You want a TTL cable, specifically it should be rated for 3.3 volts.&nbsp; &nbsp;RS-232 is the old standard that operates at a higher voltage and is unsuitable for connection to the internal direct to the CPU port in a router.</p>									</div>
