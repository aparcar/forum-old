					<p>Didn&#039;t see your post. Nodogsplash will probably suit your needs and is pretty simple to setup. Just look out for the problem I&#039;m having here,</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23164">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23164</a></p><p>Also the latest trunk, actually around revision 16000 or so the ipt_IMQ was removed and replaced. I have no idea how to get Nodog running with that and have focused on an older build. I just need some iptables expert to help me out.</p>									</div>
