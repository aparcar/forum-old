					<p>Greetings all.</p><p>I took my time looking into this problem and I am really stuck. I almost certain there&#039;s a little detail I&#039;m missing, but reading through the wiki and the forums has turned up nothing.<br />I installed OpenWRT yesterday on my Netgear WNDR3700 I cannot connect to the router remotely in any way.</p><p>I am using Backfire (10.03.1, r29592)</p><p>I have an Arris cable modem/router supplied by my ISP which I connect behind.</p><p>This is my setup:<br />- Arris cable modem: DHCP disabled, Wireless disabled, Local IP 192.168.10.254, required ports forwarded to 192.168.10.1<br />- Netgear router: WAN IP 192.168.10.1, Local IP 192.168.1.1<br />- Netgear WAN port is connected to one of the Arris&#039; LAN ports.<br />- All local PCs connect to the Netgear router.</p><p>I had the same setup before flashing OpenWRT and it worked fine.</p><p>My problem:<br />Everything works great except for connecting to the Netgear router (either via SSH or HTTP) <strong>remotely</strong> (local connections work).<br />For instance, I have SSH forwarded to one of the LAN&#039;s computers, from Arris to Netgear and then from Netgear to PC. This works fine.</p><p>Then I have this on OpenWRT:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /etc/config/uhttpd

config &#039;uhttpd&#039; &#039;main&#039;
        option &#039;home&#039; &#039;/www&#039;

        option &#039;RootPasswordAuth&#039; &#039;off&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I forward port 80 from Arris to Netgear and can&#039;t connect (I tried using a local computer and entering my public IP; connecting through 3G; SSH to work computer and SSH back home).<br />I also tried forwarding 8080 to 80 (in case the Arris has an issue with 80) and I can&#039;t connect.<br />Same with forwarding SSH (any remote and any local ports).</p><p>At first I thought the setup wasn&#039;t practical (double forwarding) but it worked before. I even tried DMZing the Netgear router through Arris.<br />So as a final test, I activated the wireless on Arris, connected to it and tried connecting to the Netgear using its WAN IP (192.168.10.1). No luck. HTTP, HTTPS, SSH. Nothing connects.</p><p>I&#039;ve been browsing the wiki and forums since I started the setup yesterday and cannot figure out what might be causing this. I was almost certain it was some stupid detail I browsed over the first couple of times but I went through them a dozen times so far.</p><p>What am I missing?</p><p>EDIT:<br />Turns out my intuition was half-right. It wasn&#039;t something stupid, it was something incredibly stupid.<br />I just set the ports to ALLOW on the firewall and now it works.</p><p>Sorry for wasting space.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>achilleas</strong> on 17 Jun 2012, 15:57)</p>
