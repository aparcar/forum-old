					<p>I am having an issue with the new C7 V2 routers (as it was on the recommended hardware page) with a serial number greater than 215C and installing openvpn.&nbsp; Since the serial number is great than 215C, I cannot use the 15.05.1 build of OpenWRT as it will not install on the gd25q128 flash chip, so I am using the build at : zioncluster.ca/openwrt/archer-c7/ath10k-firmware-qca988x_2014-11-13-77f72b5f7dd940386d9e619a17904987759b7186-1_ar71xx.ipk.&nbsp; This installs fine, but since it is a patched version of the 15.05.1 and has a different kernel ID, when I try to use opkg to install OpenVPN-OpenSSL I get the following:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Collected errors:<br /> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for openvpn-openssl:<br /> *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.18.23-1-b2f200610f46d20ef52d269421369d0c) *<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package openvpn-openssl.</p></blockquote></div><p>I understand why this is happening, the kernel build does not match the kernel build of opkg builds. The issue arises that I need to set up several routers and they all need openVPN set up on them. I have reviewed my options, and none of them are workable for me. <br /></p><ul><li><p>Roll my own copy of&nbsp; Openwrt 15.05.1, apply the patch, then compile and host my own copy of the opkg files. Not really an option </p></li><li><p>Use the Trunk Build - Not really an option because I don&#039;t want unstable code, and in the future I may have this same issue with other packages as the build changes</p></li><li><p>Try to --force-depends on the openvpn-openssl. I have tried this, and although openvpn-openssl runs, it does not create the tun device. </p></li></ul><p>I know Roll your own may be the only option available to me, but that is just not feasible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anybody have any other ideas that might work? Do we know if the person who created the zioncluster.ca/openwrt/archer-c7/ath10k-firmware-qca988x_2014-11-13-77f72b5f7dd940386d9e619a17904987759b7186-1_ar71xx.ipk file can build and post the openvpn-openssl IPK and add it that machine?</p><p>Does anybody know if when 15.05.2 will come out?&nbsp; That would solve all my problems. If&nbsp; that is not coming out anytime soon, could 15.05.1.1 be created that just has the patch that allow 15.10.1 to be installed on newer C7 routers and has a set of opkg packages that will work with the kernel? This has been a issue since late 2015, and it seems that a new compile might be forthcoming.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mschneider1</strong> on 31 Mar 2017, 17:17)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m afraid that I&#039;ve bricked my router.</p><p>I have a wdr7500 v2 (the chinese version with 6 external antennas) and I haven&#039;t been able find any help with this particular router. Most of the information I&#039;ve seen is for the newer Archer models. </p><p>I installed the version of Openwrt provided earlier in this thread by nosferatu over the original Chinese TP-link firmware that came on the router several years ago. That version of Openwrt has worked fine on the router for years until a few days ago. I was trying to set up my AT&amp;T U-Verse router in Passthrough mode and use the wdr7500 to handle the routing and wireless duties. Well something happened along the way and after the wdr7500 rebooted it is no longer working.</p><p>None of the LED&#039;s are flashing abnormally like there is anything wrong, but I cannot connect to the router at all. I can put the router into failsafe mode with the rapidly flashing system LED, but I cannot connect to the router using telnet or ssh. I have manually changed my computer&#039;s IP address, subnet, and gateway and tried using both 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 and the connection just times out every time.</p><p>I have tried the tftp recovery method shown in the wiki and the router will not connect to the tftp server at 192.168.0.66 or 192.168.1.66. I have tried uploading the stock tp-link firmware with the boot loader removed, and I have tried uploading the nosferatu Openwrt firmware that I was using and still no connection. </p><p>I have tried everything that I can think of short of opening up the router and attaching a serial cable. I don&#039;t really mind going this route, but if I&#039;m going to spend money, I might as well spend my money on a new router instead of trying to fix an old broken router.</p><p>At this point I&#039;m ready to throw the router in the trash and call it a day. I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice or anything that I may have overlooked. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, I have a Archer C7 (v1) router which I flashed with OpenWrt. But after flashing it the LAN-ports don&#039;t get any internet access. Pinging and running traceroute works perfectly fine from the router (ssh and luci), but there&#039;s no connection at all on the LAN side. Is there something I need to change in the configuration to make this happen?</p><p>Edit: Looking at Status-&gt;Routes in luci things seem reasonably OK, however there is nothing in Status-&gt;Firewall. I&#039;m not sure whether or not this is relevant? When SSHd in and reloading the firewall I get warnings/errors that the iptable table &#039;filter&#039; and &#039;nat&#039; does not exist. Is this relevant?</p><p>And less important; I saw that the wiki page said that v1 only has 2.5GHz, but there&#039;s no wlan listed anywhere in OpenWrt? Any solution to this?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>morten242</strong> on 30 Apr 2017, 19:00)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the instructions. My experience was not as straightforward. Here is my routine to debrick Archer C7 v2 (EU) S/N 216.. using ethernet dongle and Ubuntu 16.04 liveusb (some/many parts here can be superflous but it works so I really don&#039;t care <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> ):</p><p>- Fireup Ubuntu<br />- add universe repository from the software manager<br />- install packages, setup xinetd:<br />sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp<br />sudo gedit /etc/xinetd.d/tftp<br />- open gedit and copy the following</p><p>service tftp<br />{<br />protocol = udp<br />port = 69<br />socket_type = dgram<br />wait = yes<br />user = nobody<br />server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd<br />server_args = /tftpboot<br />disable = no<br />}<br />- download Archer firmware version Archer C7_V2_150427 from tp-link.com (NOTE!! The newer firmware prevents you from installing openwrt). Unzip the package<br />-create /tftpboot, copy firmware with the correct name (at least for me), and change permissions. Finally restart xinetd<br />sudo mkdir /tftpboot<br />sudo cp /home/ubuntu/Downloads/&#039;unzippedArcherfolder&#039;/&#039;ArcherFirmware&#039; /tftpboot/ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin<br />sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot<br />sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot<br />sudo service xinetd restart<br />cd /tftpboot/<br />- now continue in terminal</p><p>tftp 192.168.0.66<br />binary<br />rexmt 1<br />timeout 60<br />trace</p><p>- now you can connect the ethernet cable to the LAN1 port and change the ethernet settings in the connection settings to (wired internet settings -&gt; IP4v manual IP - add): IP 192.168.0.66, subnet 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.0.1</p><p>- go back to the terminal (with tftp open) and copy (shift+control+c) the following command:<br />put ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin</p><p>- turn the router on while holding down the wps-button, with your other hand in the terminal paste your command until it says it sent away something (e.g. &quot;sent ...&quot;)</p><p>- wait for a good 3 minutes, and you should be able to open 192.168.0.1 for router configuration. With this older firmware you can now simply download the factory bin-file (the newer chipset) from openwrt page (change the name to something short!). Openwrt should now install without problems.</p><p>-in terminal open telnet connection and change root password<br />telnet<br />open 192.168.1.1<br />passwd</p><p>- open ssh connection and install stuff you need e.g athk10, cant remember all the commands but something like this<br />ssh root@192.168.1.1<br />-insert password<br />opkg update<br />opkg install lucie-ssl athk10 firmware</p><p>Check the correct athk10 and firmware commands form the beginners guide on openwrt.org. Note that wireless connection is turned off by default, easy to open using your browser (192.168.1.1). Happy surfing!!</p>									</div>
