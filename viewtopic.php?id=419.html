					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve this problem. I use OpenWRT 3.x and my inet provider introduced wep shared key.

					<p>Before I understand this wrong. What has your provider to do with your accesspoints WLAN? Instead of using a wired connection, you are connected over a wireless link to your provider and you are connected with the linksys by wire?</p><p>WEP has always a pre-shared key. There are however two forms of authentication with WEP: open and shared. If you use the key you received from your inet provider and configure your linkys the right way, it has to work.</p><p>My guess is you don&#039;t use the right key and/or you didn&#039;t set all WEP settings right. Use at least HEX key&#039;s (there are also shorter ASCII key&#039;s, don&#039;t use these) and please read about WEP <a href="http://openwrt.org/wiki/index.cgi/OpenWrtFaq">here</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for not fully correct question.</p><p>I use linksys as a client and I&#039;m connected to my internet provider by wireless connection. I need to setup wep with shared authentication, but I don&#039;t knot how to set it up. I set wl0_wep=on and wl0_key1=xxxxxxx but without success. </p><p>I&#039;ve read all OpenWrtFaq, but I didn&#039;t&nbsp; mentioned anythink about shared autentication. Is this type of authentication supported by&nbsp; wrt?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>would it be because you neeed to turn it to a client ? As normally, it functions in server mode which is not what you want.</p><p>Another possibillity is the key is wrong. Try to code it in hex form as suggested.</p><p>Another could be that you need to set the key length. </p><p>How long is the key you get from your ISP ? In what form ?</p>									</div>

If the encryption is correct, the AP is allowed to communicate with the client.</p><p>PM needs WEP with shared authentication. The Linksys firmware can be configured to use open or shared authentication. The question is, is this possible with OpenWRT and how?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure,&nbsp; but I guess that this prevents you from associating to AP if you don&#039;t&nbsp; have correct key.</p><p>In open authentication you associate AP and than you communicate with encrypted packets. But you don&#039;t need correct key to associate.</p><p>Am I right?</p><p>And does anybody know how to force linksys to use shared authentication?</p>									</div>
