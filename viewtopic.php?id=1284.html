					<p>Hello,</p><p>anyone here with a running openwrt (non-experimental) on a 2Mb WAP54G. The device has only 8 Mb RAM - I know there are others because my own box has 4Mb/16Mb. Any openwrt customizations needed or does it run out of the box (I&#039;ve noticed the some changes in openwrt/kernel/diag.c obviously for a working reset switch. Switch working?)</p><p>TIA, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>Check where your WAP&#039;s reset button is located. I&#039;ve found the ones with the reset button next to the ethernet port to be complete and utter buggers to work with since their boot_wait doesn&#039;t work at all.</p><p>Unfortunately I&#039;ve never managed to get one of these going with openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have one victim, who has tried a prerelease of the freifunk firmware on his 2Mb WAP.
