					<p>Wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a> says that there exist two way:<br />1. Routed client <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#routed.client.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clien … lient.mode</a><br />2. Pseudobridge with relayd <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#bridged.client.mode.with.relayd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clien … ith.relayd</a><br /> Which way want you? Without your configs it looks like now you have 1st way but route between subnets 192.168.2.0/24 &amp; 192.168.1.0/24 are unknown in Belkin &amp; wndr3700</p>									</div>
