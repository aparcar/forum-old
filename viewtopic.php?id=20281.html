					<p>I have spent a while now sitting back watching the development of OpenWRT , and I believe it supports the Airlink101 ANAS350. While sitting back and wondering id I should take such a risk with my trusty NAS, I was looking for a solution for another idea. I post this here in the hardware forums because first I want to ascertain whether from a hardware perspective if one can &quot;turn around&quot; a USB port on this NAS and use it as a USB device. Specifically Use one of the USB interfaces as a USB &quot;device&quot; , and whether that device would be&nbsp; &quot;programmable&quot; to emulate ANY USB device, such as a USB hard disk. I understand the software for this is a separate issue , however I would like to see what may or may not be feasible from the hardware side. </p><p>Any Takers?</p><p>I am interested in seeing replies.</p><br /><br /><p>_________________________</p><p>EDIT<br />I would prefer to keep this on track oand not have to explore irrelevant solutions. If it is not a way to hack a USB device port onto this NAS it is not relevant. I will further state that it is my intention to take this to the next step if possible and support this USB device port in OpenWRT. When I do this the community at large will benefit and see the logicalk reason why this should be a part of OpenWRT</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>markosjal</strong> on 12 May 2009, 20:23)</p>

					<p>Strange... very similar question just came up on the Bifferboard yahoo group (<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/bifferboard/">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/bifferboard/</a>).</p><p>Why would you want to do such a thing?

					<p>Have given this some thought (in the light of the extended info you&#039;ve given in the macsat posting which.. ahem... details the *real* requirement here),</p><p>I think the route I&#039;d go is coupling a USB -&gt; IDE converter to your DVD player, and then trying to make your NAS look like an IDE drive.&nbsp; This will probably be a lot easier than making your NAS look like a USB device.&nbsp; With IDE there are only 16 data lines and about 5 control lines, and plenty of info on the net.&nbsp; Not sure if your NAS has this many GPIO pins available, but it&#039;s a thought.</p><p>uC interface to IDE controller I was thinking of:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/wesley.html">http://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/wesley.html</a><br />You can possibly use this information to implement the &#039;device&#039; side of the IDE interface.</p><p>If you think implementing the device side of USB without the proper (pre-designed) hardware is anything but hard, take a look at USBTiny <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~dicks/avr/usbtiny/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~dicks/avr/usbtiny/</a>&nbsp; - very clever stuff, and that&#039;s only a &#039;low-speed&#039; device, quite a different thing to the full or high speed you will be looking for.</p><p>My own experience is that even when presented with the correct hardware at both ends (host and device), and the spec sheets for the host, getting USB stuff working is a bit of a black art, and not for the faint hearted.&nbsp; Far better to use an off-the-shelf solution to shift the problem domain to something more understandable IMHO.</p><p>Biff.</p>									</div>

					<p>I understand your point about shifting into hardware, but I do not see that getting USB to IDE gets me any closer to the solution. It is not the physical interface that is the only issue here. Since I need a full blown NFS or Samba client (in my case Samba) , I will need a CPU, OS and the like. I have never seen an on chip Samba , nor NFS client. </p><p>I have considered something this as this and others seem to be one of the most promising solutions I have found<br /><a href="http://openpattern.org/OMRPv2_board_datasheet.pdf">http://openpattern.org/OMRPv2_board_datasheet.pdf</a></p><p>I am sure that time will tell as it looks like it is not shipping yet. </p><br /><p>I am reasonable sure the Linux USB Gadget modules will emulate a USB hard disk, such as being done on the Slug2 device side USB port.</p><p>As for your comment about USB 1.X vs 2.0 speeds . I think many of the SD DVD players only support USB 1.X and I am currently encoding a DIVX file at 1024x576 and is the highest suspected resolution that My DVD player will decode (I suspect at least) , This file is about 43 minutes in Length and fits nicely on a CD (will be under 700MB) So you can see the Data rate is about 2000Kb/sec, which I also believe is about the same limit that many NAS units will stream reliably. Sure you may get higher transfer rates but I am talking about a good steady stream here. USB 1.0 maxes out at 4Mb per second and my tests with 1.x USB to ethernet adapters to my NAS seem to confirm all of this. IN fact this also is almost attainable with a USB1.X&nbsp; connection to an old 802.11b adapter. I tested a 960x540 video at about 2000Mb/s data rate to a computer from the NAS via a Pegasus II 1.x usb to ethernet&nbsp; and it was promising. I will not say it was perfect but this Pegasus II adapter is one of the slowest in my opinion. </p><br /><br /><p>__________________________</p><p>It has been a while but I also recall that these PegasusII units were one of the few supported on some game consoles that were being used for SD playback as well.&nbsp; I know HD is the thing now, but one step at a time!</p><br /><br /><p>Mark</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>markosjal</strong> on 19 May 2009, 02:35)</p>
