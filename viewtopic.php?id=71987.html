					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have installed the OpenWrt in my Linksys AC1900WRT router with a help from a Youtube video. I would like to add the access control feature described in: github.com/k-szuster/luci-access-control, as it seems it would serve my needs in controlling the internet access time of the connected devices.</p><p>Unfortunately, the description for downloading and installing .ipk file in the above link was not enough for me, as I have no experience at all in the programming language used to control the router through the OpenWrt. I tried to read the different posts placed in this forum about this topic, but I found myself as if I am reading a subject in nuclear physics :-)!</p><p>I hope that someone would be able to take me through a step-by-step procedure on how to download and install this feature and what are the type connections needed with the router to achieve that.</p><p>Many thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you eduperez for your prompt reply.<br />If I assume that the device is my Linksys router, how to download the &quot;.ipk&quot; into it? Do I need to connect it directly to my PC via the ethernet cable?<br />I appreciate your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>The following assumes that your router is connected to the Internet, so on the router command line you can do things like <strong>ping google.com </strong>and it will go through.</p><p>First install the full version of wget so you can download directly to the router from secured sites.&nbsp; The version included by default will not work with https://.</p><p><strong>opkg update<br />opkg install wget ca-certificates</strong></p><p>Now you can wget directly from a third-party source.&nbsp; Get to your /tmp directory, which is in RAM, so you aren&#039;t using flash space.</p><p><strong>cd /tmp<br />wget <a href="https://github.com/k-szuster/luci-access-control/releases/download/0.4.1/luci-app-access-control_0.4.1_all.ipk">https://github.com/k-szuster/luci-acces … .1_all.ipk</a></strong></p><p>Then install that file.</p><p><strong>opkg install luci-app-access-control_0.4.1_all.ipk</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Sep 2017, 17:54)</p>

					<p>Many thanks mk24 for your detailed response.<br />I feel I am getting closer to do it right! One thing is not clear from your explanation: how do I get into the router command line? I have googled it and I have found many people use puTTY. So I have used it to get into the router command line, but the connection failed due to a connection error!<br />However, the rest of your description looks clear to try after resolving the above one.<br />I really appreciate your time and help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, putty. E.g. IP of router is 192.168.1.1 You should be able to login in web-interface, typing 192.168.1.1 in address bar. Can you login via web? After that try to login via ssh with the aid of putty, type 192.168.1.1, leave port 22 - ssh. You should get invitation to type login. If you get error message, write it here.</p>									</div>

					<p>If I am not mistaken, if OP has never logged into his device or changed the root password, first access has to be done using TELNET, not SSH.</p>									</div>
