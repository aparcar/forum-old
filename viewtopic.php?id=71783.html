					<p>Hi,<br />Apologies I&#039;ve searched and failed. Travelling frequently with a chromecast and keep encountering DNS issues on the road, so looking for an easy way to keep my laptop and chromecast on their own private wifi network. I&#039;d like to plug my travel router into a LAN, and then have my own wifi hotspot which acts as DHCP and DNS server for my devices.</p><p>I have problems with ISP DNS settings that can&#039;t be changed, either because VSL router won&#039;t allow or more often I don&#039;t have admin access to a router.</p><p>1. TP-Link TL-MR3040 with openwrt using GUI. Attached via ethernet cable to lan, to a router.<br />2. MR3040 given static IP, and wifi network setup <br />3. Custom DNS server addresses populated in openwrt.</p><p>I can&#039;t seem to get the MR3040 to behave as it&#039;s own DHCP server, my laptop always seems to pick up an IP from the router not the MR3040. Likewise the laptop&#039;s DNS seems to ignore whatever settings are on the MR3040.</p><p>Besides being stupidly tired and jet-lagged, where am I going wrong?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Owen</p>									</div>

The mr3040 showed that they both were on a unique subnet, different to that of the LAN. However both devices still reported that their ip address and dns were on the same subnet as the LAN, not the wlan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>o_griff</strong> on 15 Aug 2017, 09:00)</p>
