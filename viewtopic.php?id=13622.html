					<p>Hi guys,<br />I have a Asus WL-500G which i am using to rsync and play music files. I have comfigured a USB stick as a storage device. But I have noticed that there is a PCI slot in the device. So i bought a PCI to CF card adapter and connected it to the device on PCI slot. But i am not able to find any driver to make it work that CF card as a storage device. I cant even see in &#039;fdisk -l&#039; any storage media connected. Can any body tell me what i have to do furthur???</p>									</div>

					<p>I doubt you are going to get that to work without knowing what the controller is on the cf reader.&nbsp; Once you figure that out, you will need to compile a driver for it provided one exists.&nbsp; If it exists in the kernel tree is usually just a matter turning on the Kconfig option&nbsp; or makeinga kernel mod package.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look at the kamikaze docs for instructions on how to make those, but I&#039;ll warn you now that the package creation process is buggy from my own experience.&nbsp; If it&#039;s just a kconfig option that needs to be enabled, I would pick a module that already being used and add the lines to it.&nbsp; That method worked every time for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nlinux</strong> on 3 Dec 2007, 23:22)</p>
