					<p>The LEDE project has Pi3 builds.</p><p>Configuration is the same as other routers.&nbsp; Like other single Ethernet port devices, you need to get wifi up first so you can log in on the lan via wifi.&nbsp; Otherwise you won&#039;t be able to log in to the router after changing the Ethernet port to be a wan connection.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re making a &quot;dumb AP&quot;*, do not turn on the DHCP client.&nbsp; Also turn off the DHCP server.&nbsp; Leave the Ethernet and wifi AP bridged as lan. </p><p>* the &quot;dumb AP&quot; is the simplest way to &quot;share your LAN network by wifi&quot;.&nbsp; With little elaboration, it directly converts wireless packets to wired.&nbsp; The main router on the LAN makes all DHCP serves and routing decisions.</p>									</div>
