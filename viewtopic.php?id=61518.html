					<p>Hello, does anyone know if Raspberry Pi Zero is supported? It appears in the wiki, and I tried loading the version 1 OpenWRT firmware as the SOC is the same. However, it seems to disable the serial output so I can&#039;t tell what is going on beyond blinking lights. I know the serial is configured properly because I can swap in a Raspbian OS and immediately get console output.</p><p>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to install the latest trunk snapshot (Jan 7) as referenced above to boot the Raspberry Pi Zero, but the boot sequence freezes on &quot;NET: registered protocol family 24&quot; and does not continue.

					<p>hkapanen, i got the USB-Ethernet dongle to work on the Raspberry Pi Zero. I compiled from the latest trunk and included the following from menuconfig:</p><p>Kernel modules -&gt; USB Support -&gt; kmod-usb-net (Kernel modules for USB-to-Ethernet converters). I then selected kmod-usb-net-asix and asix-ax88179. Mine isnt an Apple dongle, but this worked for me. There are other usb-Ethernet drivers under kmod-usb-net that might work with the Apple device if Asix doesn&#039;t work.</p>									</div>
