					<p>I have the following boxes running RC5:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* First WL500gd running as access point (wl0_mode=ap)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;* Second WL500gd running as bridge (wl0_mode=wet)</p><p>WPA1 (PSK)&nbsp; is turned on and all works just fine:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wl0_akm=psk
wl0_crypto=tkip
wl0_ssid=not_telling
wl0_wpa_psk=not_telling</code></pre></div><p>Now the strange thing is: if a machine &quot;A&quot; behind the access point pings a machine &quot;B&quot; behind the bridge, then I look at the ARP table on &quot;A&quot;, I see the MAC address of the bridge, not of machine &quot;B&quot;!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># on machine A
$ ping 172.17.0.79

But 00:11:d8:01:cc:09 is the MAC address of the bridge itself.</p><p>If I put a second machine behind the bridge, it also works just fine. But it also shows the bridge&#039;s MAC address in ARP, not its own:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ arp 172.17.0.189
? (172.17.0.189) at 00:11:d8:01:cc:09 on rl0 [ethernet]</code></pre></div><p>If I do tcpdump at both sides I see different packets:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># original reply from B:

# packet which arrives at A:

I&#039;ve not tried any non-IP traffic (NetBIOS etc). I&#039;m just interested to know what&#039;s going on.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Brian.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, now I open a box that I was hoping not to open :-)</p><p>My knowledge of the various modes of wifi operation (STA vs WET vs WDS), and how they interact with WPA etc. (specifically WPA-PSK), is limited.</p><p>But let me check if what I know so far is correct. Assuming I have</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>   \|/  . . . . . . .  \|/  . . . . . . Z
    |                   |
    A (mode             B (mode
    |  =ap)             |  =wds)
    |                   |
    X                   Y

X and Y are wired ethernet devices; Z is a wireless client</code></pre></div><p>then am I right in saying:</p><p>(1) I must either explicitly configure the MAC address of B as WDS client into A, or else configure A for &#039;lazy wds&#039; so that anyone who wants to make a WDS association can do so</p><p>(2) An additional wireless client, Z, could associate with either A or B (depending on which has the stronger signal?)</p><p>Things that concern me about WDS:</p><p>* How does WPA work in this mode? If Z comes along and associates with B, is Z the supplicant and B the authenticator? Or is Z the supplicant and A the authenticator (tunneled through)? Or does Z authenticate to B, *and* B separately authenticate to A? Is traffic encrypted at Z, decrypted at B, and then re-encrypted for relay to B to A?</p><p>[This would particularly concern me when using WPA-EAP and RADIUS. A only needs to be configured to point to a RADIUS server; would B need to be configured to point to a RADIUS server, *and* contain its own keying material to authenticate to A?]</p><p>* What prevents loops occuring? For example, if I have access point A and WDS repeaters B, C and D, all within range of A, and all are configured for lazy WDS. A client comes along which is within range of all of them. What stops packets going B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;A or even B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;... ? Is there spanning tree or similar running? If so, is the AP forced to be the root, or should this be done manually?</p><p>* What are the security implications of WDS? If WDS is secure, then why doesn&#039;t every access point just turn on lazy WDS by default? Why should you either disable it, or enable it for certain MAC addresses only?</p><p>Cheers, Brian.</p>									</div>
