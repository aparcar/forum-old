					<p>Several weeks ago I bought a WAG160N v1 to install OpenWRT. <br />I also bought a nokia DKU-5 cable and made a USB TTL Serial converter, the cable has 4 wires (Rx, Tx, VCC 3.3V, GND)<br />While I was waiting my dku-5 cable, I installed a firmware from modemboard.de which enables telnet for WAG160N<br />It worked well, then I flashed original linksys firmware back. This one also worked well for two days but after that it stopped working.<br />Only the LED that LAN cable connected was on, no power led, no wireless led etc.<br />I tried that 30/30/30 seconds method and flashed original firmware but after reboot, modem didn&#039;t start. Only LAN led was on</p><p>I followed Virus&#039;s instructions</p><p>I connected to modem via serial console<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/2013-01-09%2000.35.18.jpg" alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/2013-01-09%2000.35.18.jpg" /></span></p><p>Set up PuTTY (and also serial port settings in Device Manager)<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/Ekran%20Al%C4%B1nt%C4%B1s%C4%B1.PNG" alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/Ekran%20Al%C4%B1nt%C4%B1s%C4%B1.PNG" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/f7d36e27ab804002842024a.png" alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/f7d36e27ab804002842024a.png" /></span></p><p>When I Plug power cord I get these trash characters<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/Screenshot_1.png" alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54474190/wag160n/Screenshot_1.png" /></span></p><br /><br /><p>I tried to plug unplug power cord hundred times <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <br />I&#039;ve got&nbsp; boot messages once or twice at first but I couldn&#039;t get it to work again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />When I got boot messages I saw that modem said &quot;press any key to stop startup script after 1 second&quot; or something like that<br />Then there were lots of exception messages and buch of hex adresses over and over again.</p><p>Is there anything that I can do to fix my modem and install openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sinancetinkaya</strong> on 9 Jan 2013, 12:58)</p>

					<p>Although I am pretty sure the boud should be 115200 - the screenshot looks like a baud mismatch or any other serial misconfiguration.<br />Just try other bauds and see if it gets better.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, and I am not sure which TTL converter you used but normally you don&#039;t need to connect the VCC, only RX,TX and GND.</p>									</div>

					<p>I used Nokia dku-5 cable<br />I tried all combinations<br />VCC,RX,TX,GND<br />RX,TX,GND<br />RX,TX<br />But the result was always same<br />Then I though that it might be a malfunctioning usb ttl converter<br />I&#039;m going to order another one which will not be a dku-5 cable<br />What should I buy? the one that has a FTDI chip (FT232) ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Moreover I contacted a person from this forum which had the same problem in past.<br />He said he was unable to solve his problem with his WAG160N too, so he sent his modem to a service center.<br />May be it&#039;s a common problem for WAG160N<br />Because nothing is working on the modem, no special maintenance mode which is accessible by the 30/30/30 seconds method.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sinancetinkaya</strong> on 15 Jan 2013, 13:59)</p>
