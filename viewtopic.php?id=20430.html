					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I have a problem about my OpenWrt box, an Asus WL-520gU with Kamikaze r13325 and kernel 2.4. When someone in our house uses a P2P software (either Emule or Bittorrent), Web navigation suddenly becomes quite difficult: I need to click Reload several times on our browsers to successfully (or even partially) get one page.<br />What I can see, either from my PC, from my colleagues&#039; PC and from the router, is that ICMP pings go trough flawlessly; instead, any TCP connection (tested via wget -O- <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> &gt; /dev/null) has something like 20-30% probability to end up with a timeout and a &quot;connection refused&quot; error.<br />I also see that this behaviour is probably correlated with the number of active TCP/UDP connections (wc /proc/net/ip_conntrack): when this number goes higher than 300 the web navigation becomes annoying; when it returns to lower values, everthing is OK.<br />This behaviour doesn&#039;t affect existing TCP connections&#039; bandwidth, only newly created ones. There&#039;s no difference in using the wireless or wired interface, and it isn&#039;t related to our ISP&#039;s connection since when not using OpenWrt box, everything goes well.<br />The load factor keeps always on low values: 0.10, 0.05, 0.00.</p><p>Any help is very appreciated!</p><p>Best regards,<br />Enrico</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m getting confused: at this moment I&#039;m having a /proc/net/ip_conntrack with 1700 lines (mostly due to an eMule running on my colleague&#039;s machine), and currently no connectivity problems at all.</p><br /><p>Why my box (in NAT) sometimes shows very poor performance while making new tcp/udp connections???<br />What can I check to further diagnose the problem?</p><p>Best regards,<br />Enrico</p>									</div>
