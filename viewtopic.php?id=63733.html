					<p>I&#039;ve upgraded a Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N from 15.05. to 15.01.1. Despite the &quot;keep settings&quot; was checked, nano wasn&#039;t kept (it was the only additional software, as the space is quite sparse for installations here). I intended to add the package later on, but it won&#039;t install, saying there&#039;s not enough space:</p><p>The UI (under System/Software) says at the top: Free space: 9% (36.00 KB) </p><p>If I try to install it in the shell, I get the following output:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Installing nano (2.4.1-1) to root...

The packages included in the firmware are compressed, so they take less space than if they are installed with opkg later.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 2 May 2016, 12:49)</p>

					<p>Thanks, I&#039;ll give it a shot. On a related note - if a router has 8 GB flash, then there will be enough space for the custom blacklist in /overlay?</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, it&#039;s neither rhetorical nor unrelated. A few days ago when I was searching the forum (and the net in general) for clues about my issue, I encountered somewhere that 4 GB units have overlay space problems. And as I&#039;m also contemplating migrating one 8 GB router to OpenWRT, I would prefer to hear it in advance whether those units are better off in these matters (I know it lacks in NVRAM space with dd-wrt, though).</p>									</div>
