					<p>Hello.<br />so many devices available now that it becomes hard to understand which can do what and which cannot.</p><p>I have a list of few simple needs from my new wifi router that can be done with or without openWrt:</p><p>1. share a mobile internet (sim card or usb modem). Also have the ethernet port and possibility to act as a wifi repeater.<br />2. Wireless usb Hub to connect printer, hdd or any other usb device that can be used on my mac.<br /> 2.1. Stream music from mac to speakers/amplifier wirelessly (through usb sound card plugged into usb port)<br /> 2.2. Play internet radio directly from router (if that is possible)</p><br /><p>Could you please give me an insight which devices could do that and would not cost an arm or leg?</p><br /><p>Casper</p>									</div>

					<p>the best and cheapest i can think of is tp-link tl-wr703n - but you have to order it online from China - also available on ebay<br />or if you&#039;re in Eu or US you can get the tp-link tl-mr3020 (export sibling of the above) - a few more euros/bucks - but it&#039;s avaiable in shops.<br />it&#039;s small, low profile and fully supported by openwrt.</p>									</div>
