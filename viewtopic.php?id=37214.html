					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve trawled the internet for an easy guide to change to English. I am not a programmer. I can connect to TP_LINK using browser 192.168.1.1 ok and find userRpm/SoftwareUpgradeRpm.htm by hovering over links in Chinese. Is there a simple step by step guide to upload English version and is there a user guide. Thanks a mil in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cool, you were in failsafe mode.<br />But why you enter to failsafe mode ?<br />Change password also don&#039;t need failsafe.<br />And, openwrt does not come with webui, of coz you can&#039;t connect via web.</p><p>After fresh flashed, you haven&#039;t set password, so you cannot connect via ssh.<br />Should use telnet !<br />After set your password, telnet will disable, then connect via ssh......</p><p>Next step, read here.....<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start</a><br />Not just asking and asking in the forum.<br />Obviously you haven&#039;t read any documentation.</p>									</div>

					<p>I followed procedure to upgrade via web interface. It loaded ok and I set ssh passwd. However when I tried to use passwd I got denied access. To cut a long story short I followed openwrt wr703n guide and tried failsafe to reset ssh passwd and got in a complete muddle as it seemed to reset passwd but I still couldn&#039;t access ssh.

					<p>appreciate speedy reply. I reflashed router and started fresh in order to document process and this time it worked. Two possible reasons for success this time round, first I downloaded lastest wr703n upgrade firmware (I may have used version downloaded 8/6/2012 when process failed - not sure), second I did not activate luci packages untill after all packages were installed. <br />I have a second wr703 and I will complete process with luci activated earlier in process.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>PeterN</strong> on 23 Jun 2012, 15:51)</p>
