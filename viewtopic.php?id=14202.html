					<p>All,</p><p>I have a Motorola WR850G and as explained in the wiki have found the input pads for GPIO 4.&nbsp; Using the gpiotest program I have turned it on and off and found that I can toggle a 5v output on it (note: not a 3v).</p><p>I want to use this GPIO as an input.&nbsp; I am planning to use it with LIRC and plan to connect a IR receiver circuit to it.&nbsp; Elsewhere on this forum, there is a precompiled LIRC working with gpio (both for sending IR and receiving IR). I intend to use that to receive IR.&nbsp; <br />The circuit without an IR has 5v on it and when blasted with IR gives me 3.x volts (measured using a multimeter).&nbsp; I am not sure if it is bringing/pulling it down to 0v and my multimeter is simply showing an average !</p><p>I don&#039;t know much about electronics. The questions I have is: <br />- How do I know whether a gpio port is in or out or supports both ?<br />- Can I connect this IR receiver circuit into the gpio pad without blowing it up ?<br />- In terms of a gpio input, does it work by sensing a presence or absence of voltage at the pad ? And is this 5v or 3v ?<br />- Will I be able to read the 0-5v pulses coming from the IR receiver ?&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks for your help,<br />Arun</p>									</div>

					<p>Just add a resistor of about 1k to limit the current. The meter would show an average with any serial data, including IRDA.<br />Could you just connect it to a serial port? I don&#039;t think driving IRDA from scratch would work very well.</p>									</div>
