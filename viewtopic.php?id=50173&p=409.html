It is less than optimal but it is what we have right now, unless someone takes the time to reverse-engineer the firmware blob or use open-hardware then we are going to always depend on blobs since manufacturers don&#039;t want to give away their &quot;competitive advantage&quot; tho open sourcing the firmware would have yielded stable and fast wireless long ago.</p>									</div>

					<p>First off I never used the word <em>open</em>, nor was it implied, appears some like to add content to posts by others. But if a philosophical debate is to be made of something I did not actually say, fine. By my definition of what constitutes <em>open</em> I would not include what amounts to a wrapper around a blob protected by a NDA to the owner of that blob. To me that flies in the very face of the meaning of <em>open</em>.</p><p>But one more time. My comment was in reference to this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=314240#p314240">post</a>, where the gist of the post appears to be regarding the stability/availability of wifi drivers for a couple of Netgear devices, and ends with an inquiry regarding wifi(implied) on the wrt1900ac. I simply stated that the same issue that exists on other devices also exists with the wifi driver mwlwifi; i.e. it is not free and clear of blobs. I stated absolutely nothing as to whether I considered it open or otherwise, a simple statement of fact that I assume a potential purchaser of the device would like to be made cognizant. Were I to go further I would add that anyone considering such a device might do well to add a mediatek device to their potential buy list ahead of the wrt1900ac for that very reason.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all. I’m in a bit of a panic. I was running and nightly of DD on my wrt1900ac v2 and was having stability issues. I decided to flash back to DD RC3, but forgot I had configured a root overlay on usb. After flashing, the router wouldn’t come back up.</p><p>I tried using the reset button trick, but couldn’t get it to flash. Now, the only lights which turn on when I boot are Power, eSATA, and one of the interface lights if I have a ethernet cable plugged in. I ordered the following cp2102 from Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CP2102-Module-Serial-Converter-Adapter/dp/B00SL0U3RG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457792821&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cp2102.">http://www.amazon.com/CP2102-Module-Ser … ds=cp2102.</a> However, when I connect it via minicom, screen, or picocom (for example, using “pico com -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0”), I get no output on the terminal when booting, even though I’ve verified via dmesg that ttyUSB0 is the device getting assigned to the cp2102. I’ve tried wired two ways, one with the TX on the wrt to RXD on the cp2102, and RX on the wrt to TXD on cp2102, and vice versa (RX-&gt;RXD, TX-&gt;TXD). However, neither seems to work. Still, just power light, esata, and physical link light if ethernet cable is plugged in. Note, I do get activity on the physical link (flashing) if something is occurring over the wire, but that’s it.</p><p>I’m concerned I’ve corrupted the boot loader somehow. Again, reset button seems to do nothing, even after holding down for one minute. I’ve found the following instructions for fixing a corrupt boot loader (<a href="https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wiki/WRT1900AC-corrupt-bootloader-recovery">https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wi … r-recovery</a>) and would try them, but I’m not certain if, since mine is hardware version V2, if they are appropriate.</p><p>Here are pics of my setup:</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8_xgBQucJh1bEJ6YjdXSndDNEU&amp;usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id= … sp=sharing</a></p><p>Can anyone help?
