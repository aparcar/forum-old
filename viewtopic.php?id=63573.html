					<p>Let us say that I have an OpenWRT running right now and I would like to know what the default config files generated at boot would look like. Is there a way to do that without harming the running system? I do not want to reboot or change the current config.</p><p>It would be nice to be able to generate just individual files, like /etc/config/wireless, but creating a new default directory somewhere would be fine too.</p>									</div>

					<p>The config files are generated in a distributed way, and the exact methods depend on the platform and router. So, there is no single place with all default files. </p><p>For most routers the following things are valid:<br />(assuming normal squashfs + jffs2 overlay filesystem, mac80211 based wifi etc.) </p><p>* There is no backup copy of settings for packages installed by the user via opkg. Those settings are just in /etc/config<br />* For most of the packages included in the firmware image, the original settings can be found in /rom/etc/config directory<br />* /etc/config/network is generated by a script at the first boot after flash. No config file copy anywhere.<br />* /etc/config/wireless is similarly generated at the first boot. But you can re-generate the defaults with &quot;wifi detect&quot; command if you first delete or rename /etc/config/wireless . (The script first checks that there are no settings, so you really need to remove the existing settings file to see the output of the script. )</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have LuCI installed - you could use its &quot;settings back-up&quot; feature.<br />There will be a *.tar.gz file with all your current settings.<br />Opening it on another host (with WinZIP or similar) you could inspect each and every configuration file on your router.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booBot</strong> on 22 Mar 2016, 10:44)</p>
