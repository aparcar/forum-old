					<p>Hello to everyone.</p><p>I&#039; m asking your help for create a WiFi Bridge connection in order to hook up my Ethernet-only devices which are in a different room from mine primary router.</p><p>Primary Router: Netgear DGN2200<br />WDS access point: TP-Link WR841ND</p><p>Now, I&#039;d like to install openwrt on the WDS AP but I&#039;m not sure if I can achieve the WiFi bridge.<br />I&#039;d like not to modify the original firmware on my primary Router though; there could be incompatibility issues?</p><p>If , hypothetically, I manage to create a bridge between this 2 Routers, is possible to maintain a WPA+WPA2 protected WiFi line or should I switch to WEP which my understanding was that is more suitable for such applications?</p><p>Thank you in advance for your time!</p>									</div>

					<p>hi baglioÔºÅ</p><p>That&#039;s a easy stuff if you flash a openwrt firmware to your tplink router. You can specify your router to work in a client mode. And then the router is just like a usb wireless card. you can connect the tplink to your primary router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah. Download the original firmware from the tplink official site. And then flashed back to your modified router. In case of failure or any exceptions, just use the reset button on the backside of your router.</p>									</div>
