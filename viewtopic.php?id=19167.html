					<p>Nope its not PHP, as PHP is far too inefficient for our purposes.<br />When a file is uploaded through a browser its usually transmitted as multipart/form-data in the Body of the POST-request.</p><p>That means the browser encloses the file into a multipart MIME message.<br />This is described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt</a>.</p>									</div>
