These are than parsed by firmware update utility, before being written to the flash. As you flashed them with all the surroundings (checksums, partition table, ...) no wonder it was not booting.</p><p>Ad Q2: I just did a bit of measurements. Unfortunately only AC device which I have available right now is Nexus 5, but iperf still did 185 Mbits/sec, which is comparable to what I can achieve with Turris Omnia router and Nexus 5.</p>									</div>

What kind of speeds you get when devices are next to each other?</p></blockquote></div><p>Ad Q1: sorry I am not sure -&nbsp; I operate device in AP mode, where I have only LAN<br />Ad Q2: see bellow - EU unit<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Wiphy phy1
