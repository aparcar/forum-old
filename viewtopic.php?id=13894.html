					<p>Hi there,</p><p>Today i have just installed on my ASUS WL500 Premium router, the Kamikaze 0.79 package. Everything went just fine. After that i have installed the X-WRT package for web interface. Again, everything went fine.</p><p>In the web interface i have changed in the Network &gt; LAN Settings, from Static to DHCP. When i applied the changes, it took a long time and after that the web page just got blank. I have refreshed the web page but nothing. I have restarted the router and now i have an &quot;Limited or no connectivity&quot; message on my Local Area Connection. If i ping it to 192.168.1.1 i get an &quot;destination host unreachable&quot;.</p><p>Even if i am putting it in the diag mode, it can&#039;t see the 192.168.1.1 address, so i can&#039;t recover the firmware.</p><p>Have i bricked the router ? Can anyone help&nbsp; me ? </p><p>Thank you in advance !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>simistef</strong> on 27 Dec 2007, 12:00)</p>

					<p>your problem is that your lan interface is looking for a dhcp server. Either plug it into the LAN port on another router, setup a dhcp server on your computer, or go into failsafe mode on the router, or connect to it via a serial port, and fix the config.</p>									</div>

					<p>when in failsafe, you must set your computer to 192.168.1.2 manually, since dhcp is not started in failsafe</p><p>the address assigned to your router from the other dhcp server is not in any specific order, it may be random within the range, or not. look at the router&#039;s logs, or arp traffic to figure out the router&#039;s ip address.</p>									</div>

					<p>well, i did somehow restore the original firmware...more exactly the one from the ASUS site (WL500gp_1.9.7.5_TW.trx), but now i can&#039;t access <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a></p><p>later edit: I must say that the power led is blinking and the led of port 1 is on</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>simistef</strong> on 27 Dec 2007, 14:02)</p>

					<p>hi,</p><p>you get 3 recommended options how to fix your settings (failsafe, set up dhcp-server, and serial-console). but you tried another one?<br />I can only say, that flashing to original firmware was not successful! <br />a blinking powerled means that the router cannot load the system and stays in the bootloader waiting for a tftp upload of a working firmwareimage. before this you had a router with a messed up networkconfig, and now you have a router no system on it.<br />You can try upload an image with tftp, if this fails you need a serial-console-cable (adapter from rs232toTTL) open the case and solder some pins to it and connect the serial cable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 27 Dec 2007, 16:02)</p>

					<p>it seems that i can only make the router to function, if i&#039;m installing on it OpenWRT firmwares, like WhiteRussian or Kamikze. I tried to install te backup of my original firmware, the firmware from ASUS site and even DD-WRT, nut nothing worked. Only OpenWRT .... isn&#039;t it strange ?</p><p>Is there a way to format the memory of the router ?</p>									</div>

					<p>hi,</p><p>IÂ´m not shure, but I remember that there is a problem (limit) when flashing with tftp. I think you canÂ´t flash images&nbsp; that are bigger than 3 MB (or something like that). This could be the reason why you can flash openwrt, which is quite small, but no other firmware. <br />If you want to flash another image you have to flash it from a running system (in openwrt with the mtd-utility) and not in the bootloader trough tftp.</p><p>So I donÂ´t think you need to format the flash, and I would be careful in doing so, because if you erase the bootloader, which is stored in the flash too, your only chance to recover your router would be a JTAG-Interface, which the WL-500GP donÂ´t have, so you would need to desolder the flash-chip and reprogram it somewhere else. </p><p>and @Johnex: if all lights are off, your router has a hardwaredefect, or your bootloader is not working. you can try to connect through serial, and if this doesnÂ´t work, your last chance is reflashing it with JTAG (if your router has a connector)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 28 Dec 2007, 14:24)</p>
