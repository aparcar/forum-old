					<p>I run openwrt on my router for quite a while now. I also run samba. After i upgraded the os of my laptop (kubuntu) i can&#039;t use smbfs anymore.... so i wanted to build a up to date samba.<br />But i cant find samba anywhere when i run make menuconfig (i use latest svn)</p><p>Can somebody tell me where this is? Or is this not in the toolchain but only available in the downloads section?</p><p>Thanks for all help.<br />Regards, MRX</p>									</div>

					<p>New versions of Ubuntu only support cifs which doesn&#039;t work with the samba 2.0 included in openwrt. I resorted to ftp (curlftpfs) when I need to transfer larger files. Another option would be nfs. Samba 3.x would support cifs but needs nuch more memory than 2.0.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.</p><p>I have a bunch of mp3&#039;s stored on the disk attached to my router and i used to mount that disk on my laptop with smbfs and play the mp3&#039;s.<br />So i&#039;m not happy with this. I never used nfs, how can i set this up?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrx</strong> on 20 Jun 2008, 12:19)</p>

					<p>I haven&#039;t used the nfs server in openwrt myself but according to <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11847">this post</a> it seems to be no problem. For kamikaze 7.09 that is.</p>									</div>
