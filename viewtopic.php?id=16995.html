					<p>I&#039;m running Kamikaze on a WRT54GL at the moment, but I want to buy a new router which will do ADSL2+, 802.11 and USB.&nbsp; The only one in the hardware list on the wiki is the STAR-NET ADSL 2110EHR V7.0+ - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/ADLS2110HR_7?highlight=(CategoryDslModems)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ DslModems)</a></p><p>But the page is a bit vague on how well supported it is and I can&#039;t seem to find anywhere in the UK selling it.&nbsp; Does anyone know if it will work ok (and where to get hold of one), or can anyone recommend something else that is supported which meets these criteria?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>That device does not have enough flash or RAM for OpenWRT, and even if it did, neither its wireless nor its USB are supported yet. You should take a look at the recent posts about the brcm63xx port, unless you want to help rewrite OpenWRT&#039;s platform support code for AR7 from scratch, yet again.</p>									</div>
