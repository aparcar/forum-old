					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;d like to know about the current support status of the TP-Link Archer C7 v2. There are a few issues listed in the bugtracker and on this forum, mostly relating to 5GHz wifi - but it&#039;s hard to guess, how common these issues are. Maybe it&#039;s just a miniority, maybe not. So, I&#039;d like to know:</p><p><strong>Who is using OpenWRT on an Archer C5/C7 and are you having any issues at with it?</strong><br />What kind of clients do you use?<br />If there are unresolved common issues, do you (and this would be more directed towards the developers) expect them to be resolved for the final Chaos Calmer release?</p><p><em>Background:</em> I&#039;m new to OpenWRT but I&#039;d like to replace my current proprietary router with a model that can run OpenWRT. At this point, I prefer a model with ac-wifi support. After some research on the wiki I went on and bought a TP Link Archer C7 v2 when it was discounted these days. I haven&#039;t received it and still a chance to send it back if there would be too many issues with it. I&#039;m especially concerned about possible issues with Apple clients that have been reported, since my wife is basically an Apple-only user, while I mostly use Linux and Windows clients.</p><br /><p>Cheers,</p><p>Timo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 16 Jul 2015, 21:33)</p>

					<p>I have an Archer C7, with Chaos Chalmer RC2. The router itself is very good for the price.<br />I did not used it with stock firmware, just taked it out of the box and installed OpenWRT.</p><p>My experience: </p><p>- 5ghz wlan is unstable, clients drops on high traffic. I opened a ticket on OpenWRT and contacted ath10k developers trying to debug the issue.<br />- 2.4ghz and wired are rock solid. Very good range and throughput.</p><p>It&#039;s a good router, OpenWRT it&#039;s an excellent firmware, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just a little bug with 5ghz that will be soon discovered and solved: ath10k interface are very common!</p>									</div>

					<p>We will see what we get with CC RC3. For me CC RC2 is rock stable but what @petiso say 5GHz is some unstable and don&#039;t get all the speed that offers (on AC).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your answers. So, while I still haven&#039;t tried yet (we&#039;re about to move - so there&#039;s plenty of other work to do), I decided to keep the Archer C7 v2. Exchanging it for a WDR4300 doesn&#039;t seem like an investment for the future and the Linksys WRT1200 is still quite expensive in comparison. So I just hope that either my clients will just work fine as it seems to do for some people here too, or that the 5GHz issues will get fixed eventually. </p><p><strong>One more question about the development model of Openwrt:</strong><br />Let&#039;s assume the final Chaos Calmer verison gets released before the 5GHz issues are resolved. Let&#039;s further assume that a couple of weeks later, a newer version of the ath10k kernel module or firmware eventually fixes the issues.<br />Would these fixes be backported to Chaos Calmer? Or is a final release &quot;frozen&quot; and the only way to get the fix is to use a newer trunk version?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Timo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 20 Jul 2015, 11:59)</p>

They backport certain things but not others. It also depends how close they are to the next stable release. I imagine if it there is an important fix shortly after CC final, they&#039;ll backport it.</p>									</div>
