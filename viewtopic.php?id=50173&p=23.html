How about Quantenna in the case of the AC-87U? Nope. So it doesn&#039;t sound much better than the WRT1900AC in that respect. </p><p>I also really don&#039;t think either Asus or Netgear get it. If they did, we wouldn&#039;t need 3rd party firmware at all. Although, I must admit that AsusWRT, based on Tomato, is not bad, but is still stuck on an outdated kernel, probably in part due to those closed-source Broadcom drivers. </p><p>Both Asus and Netgear have proclaimed their open source support in the past while also not providing full driver source. I think Belkin/Linksys&#039; mistake was claiming OpenWrt support without engaging the developers prior to announcement or release. On top of that, they didn&#039;t have it ready themselves and initial releases were effectively unusable by the community. See these claims for Asus &amp; Netgear:<br /><a href="http://promos.asus.com/US/ASUS_DD-WRT/">http://promos.asus.com/US/ASUS_DD-WRT/</a><br /><a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/WNR3500L.aspx">http://www.netgear.com/home/products/ne … 3500L.aspx</a></p><p>To me, Atheros is the only chipset company that has really been good about releasing source for their drivers in the wifi router market, but even the latest ath10k I think requires a binary blob. It&#039;s no surprise then that the focus of most current OpenWrt development has been on Atheros-based hardware. That&#039;s where I&#039;d put my money. Hope to see some IPQ806x (dual core ARM) hardware soon.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 31 Jul 2014, 01:03)</p>
