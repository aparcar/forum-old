					<p>Hi!</p><p>Im starting to play with a cisco dpc3208 cable modem. I want to install openwrt or modificated ecos fw on it. </p><p>Now i figure it out how to make a fw file downloadable to modem. It start to download but after the download the crc32 chek fail.</p><p>I need some info about the firmware header. How can i edit it. I think the crc32 value was in the header, i just need recalculate, or bypass it somehowto start the main work on the fw. I don&#039;t can edit the first part of the header, if i edit it, the modem say it&#039;s incompatibile fw.</p><p>I have SPI dump so i can recover the modem anytime, not problem if i brick the modem, my first goal to make an image&nbsp; wich is downloadable for the modem and the crc check pass.</p>									</div>
