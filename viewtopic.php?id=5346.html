					<p>You&#039;re reading explicitly looking for an immediate solution, not actually reading the wealth of information that&#039;s there.</p><p>Since the DMZ led didn&#039;t light <strong>(note that you didn&#039;t mention this in your original post)</strong> we can conclude that you&#039;re using one of the jffs2 firmwares <strong>(note that you didn&#039;t mention this either)</strong> so you can&#039;t get into failsafe (the reason I gave you the link).</p><p>If you still have boot_wait on <strong>(you didn&#039;t mention this)</strong> then you can just tftp the firmware back on (follow the installation instructions linked from the troubleshooting page).<br />If not, then you&#039;ll have to build a serial or jtag <strong>(again, see the troubleshooting page)</strong></p>									</div>
