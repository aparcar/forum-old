					<p>(Dear Admins, I hope I do not break any rules with this.).</p><p>We bought a whole bunch of motorola WR850G v2 for a vertical market project that needs some specialized packages. Due to that project, I visit the forums regularly and got a lot of help from here. However I noticed that a lot of ppl have installation problems. I would like to help out in 2 ways</p><p>1) Providing a pre-configured router<br />2) Providing #1 in a cost-effective manner. We literally buy hundreds of these a year and therefore have cost advantages for buying in bulk.</p><p>I would offer a new, unused preconfigured RC5 router (Motorola WR850G v2) for about $50 plus shipping (About $3-4 in the continental US. Shipping outside the US would also be possible). </p><p>This would help the motorola router users because any issues that we see in that particular hardware version would have been solved or a work-around been found because we use lots of those routers. I want to get everyone&#039;s opinion before I put this offer out there and configure our website to accept such orders from this community. Please note that is a way of my company to give back to the community.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ivoshiee - thanks for the words of compliments</p><p>I&#039;m definitely going to be updating that page...like I said before we got a lot of help from this community and we (my company and I) would like to give back. In fact the price of $50 is lower than what that hardware unit goes for. Amazon has it for 64.99 plus shipping. And they have them out of stock :)</p><p>&quot;Motorola 498417-001-00&nbsp; amazon.com<br />Wireless Broadband Router Only $64.99 (or order used).&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DK7AO/103-9691746-0928648?n=172282">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D … 8?n=172282</a></p><br /><p>=&gt; I would also like to make openwrt more mainstream. Why cant we have a linksys, a motorola, a netgear and an openwrt router sitting side by side at BestBuy? What do you guys think we need to do to make this product mainstream? I can help out from a hardware, software testing and basic software dev side. Do we have any marketing or sales people out here who can help?</p><p>=&gt; Oh I forgot to mention that we could reach a stage where the volume justifies OEMing this product. It would be kind of cool to have a pure OpenWRT router with a lot more memory and a faster CPU :)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LSU_guy</strong> on 8 May 2006, 04:05)</p>

					<p>Gunni - The US post office can do it for about $5-7. However, if we reach a higher volume level with europe, I can treat this as a distribution product and ship about 100 of them out to a distribution facility and have them ship out to local destinations in europe. It doesnt take that much to reach this level. At about 50 orders per month, I could start doing that. That could further lower the shipping price.</p><p>Yan - At $50, I would hope to reach a lot of people initially and then have these people consider this router before purchasing one out there. I was also hoping to reach a higher volume level with motorola and hence OEM their product. At that point we can add the following things (included in the $50)<br />1) Faster Processor<br />2) More memory so we could use more packages<br />3) Added USB port<br />4) Possibly adding an RS232 port.</p><p>What do you guys think?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it is a great idea; a few weeks ago I was wondering how to make all the community to buy from the same hardware vendor in the way that this vendor could contact a chinese company to make it build the perfect openwrt router at very cheap costs (something like 20-30$ at the end-user)...<br />Maybe the best way to gather the community consensus is to find a way to sold a router at very low costs (50$+ 7$ shipping, could be fine, but what about VAT and Custom?); AND to contribute the project pushing one of the wireless chip producers to release their source code or the needed specs to develop one.<br />Such a project, after a few thousands of units sold, could even lead chipset producers to release detailed infos about their chipset (otherwise this vendor could choose to use a different chipset...).<br />I mean... this is the only way to fully release the freedom of wireless as at the moment even OpenWrt can&#039;t do much without support from chipset vendors; don&#039;t misunderstand me, OpenWrt it is a miracle of technology, but depends too much on Linksys, Broadcom, Atheros and so on... if they decide to stop producing routers or retire the binary driver... moreover many of the wireless functionalities can&#039;t be used as there&#039;s no way to understand how the have been implemented... and so on.</p><p>As an example at the moment our small community (Italy) uses WRT54GL but I would be happy to switch to other routers as: a) we can&#039;t find them in shops; b) they cost too much (75-80 euros, shipping costs and taxes included). We also have the problem that many of the supported routers aren&#039;t sold in Italy and many of them even in Europe.<br />So the cost lever could be enough to reach a minimum level of consensus, but you should also prove step by step to offer freedom to this community.

I agree with you - the volume would actually force our chipset manufacturers to release more info to us. And since we release this to the world, this would ensure that more people switch to openwrt :). </p><p>You raised a very important question on customs and VAT. I have to fill out a customs form to send anything out of the country. However, if I&#039;m only sending one unit per package, I can claim it as a sample with a $0 value. This lets me ship it out to you, however individual countries decide if they really want to treat this as a $0 item. Will this work for Europe or Italy?</p>									</div>

I was using them as cheap router manufacturer and switching their software to openwrt. However with their hardware v5, they lowered their memory and switched to VxWorks.

The vlan thing isn&#039;t an issue for my client setup, only for AP&#039;s, and within a few months won&#039;t matter any more for my AP&#039;s either as I&#039;m going fully tagged eventually.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>
