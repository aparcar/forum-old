					<p>Hi all! <br />I am having problem with my Motorola wr850g - I bricked it quite well.<br />First I was&nbsp; playing with nvram settings and I got a nice brick. <br />While I was trying to recover it it screwed it even more. <br />I tried the short pin method - it worked but the firmware upload stopped at some %.<br />Right now I have stopped at the JTAG method.<br />I got a working cfe and nvram images ( great thanks to Glenn!!!),but when I flash the cfe it seems to be ok. But when I backup it it is a different file!<br />I made a simple test - I generated a cfe file filled with zeros and flashed the cfe.<br />I backuped the zero cfe checked it - it was full of zeros.<br />My next step was similar - generated file full of ones (FF) (I checked it with hex editor), flashed it and backuped. Guess what - the backup file was full of zeros.<br />After that I tried to erase the cfe , flash with a valid cfe but the backup cfe is always the same - zeros:(<br />Does anybody knows what is it about ? </p><p>My second question : <br />Let&#039;s say that I erase the &quot;wholeflash&quot; - should I still get some output on serial console ? <br />I tried to soldier a serial cable but doesn&#039;t seem to work - I&#039;m just wondering if it&#039;s the cables fault or there is nothing to generate the output ( the firmware is erased).</p><p>I will be very grateful for any tips on those two. <br />Cheers <br />Michal</p>									</div>
