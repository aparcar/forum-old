					<p>I&#039;m relatively new to VLANs, so please excuse me if this seem to be dumb questions, but I could not find answers so far from reading the docs and posts in this and other forums.</p><p>I use an Alix 2 w/o WiFi running OpenWRT AA as a router for several TL-WA901 APs with up to four SSIDs, each on a separate VLAN:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>| DSL-Router |---------|eth0  Alix 2  eth1|-----trunk----| TL-WA901ND with 4 SSIDs+VLAN IDs |</code></pre></div><p>The VLAN ids on the WA910 are 7, 11, 12 and 13. On the Alix I have the following network config:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface private
    option ifname   &#039;eth1.7&#039;
    option proto    static
    option ipaddr   192.168.7.1
    option netmask  255.255.255.0
    
config interface lan
    option ifname    &#039;eth1.11&#039;
    option proto     static
    option ipaddr    192.168.11.1
    option netmask   255.255.255.0
    
config interface dmz
    option ifname    &#039;eth1.12&#039;
    option proto     static
    option ipaddr    192.168.12.1
    option netmask   255.255.255.0
    
config interface vip
    option ifname    &#039;eth1.13&#039;
    option proto     static
    option ipaddr    192.168.13.1
    option netmask   255.255.255.0</code></pre></div><p>Now I would like to use the third NIC (eth2) on the Alix2 as a second trunk port - not because I&#039;m short of ports, but mainly because users should be able to connect the APs to either port ...&nbsp; If I use the <em>type bridge</em> config option to combine the virtual interfaces into a bridged interface, the bridge ids are constructed from the MAC address of the first interface listed in the <em>ifname</em> option. As far as I understand, the bridge ids must be unique. Therefore, this config does work:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface private
    option ifname   &#039;eth1.7 eth2.7&#039;
    option type      bridge
    ...

config interface lan
    option ifname   &#039;eth2.11 eth1.11&#039;
    option type      bridge
    ...</code></pre></div><p><em>br-private</em> will have the bridge id derived from the MAC address of <em>eth1</em>, while <em>br-lan</em> will get its id from the MAC of <em>eth2</em>. But as soon as I add another bridge, it ends up with two or more bridges with the same bridge id, which breaks the setup.</p><p>My first question is:<br />How can I bridge together the two ports for the <em>dmz</em> and <em>vip</em> interfaces? Is there a better way I don&#039;t see? Or is it just not possible?</p><p>Second question:<br />I want to restrict access to certain services (web UI, ssh) for devices on the <em>private</em> VLAN. I thought that VLAN tagging would prevent also access to the Alix2 router on layer 2, e.g. that it would not be possible to access the <em>private</em> IP of the router (192.168.7.1) from within the <em>lan</em> network (192.168.11.0/24). But I can access all IPs of the router from clients within all networks. So do VLAN ids not apply to the router itself? Or is this caused by using IP aliases for VLAN tagging, so that I have to set up firewall rules to achieve this on layer 3? </p><p>Third question:<br />Do non-manageable switches transparently forward VLAN-tagged frames between two VLAN-capable devices connected to that switch or do I have to use manageable switches?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any tips!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>R1D2</strong> on 23 Jan 2016, 14:25)</p>
