					<p>Hi,</p><p>As you already know - when building openwrt from source the wifi is off.<br />So - what i did till now:<br />I&#039;ve copied my /etc/config/wireless to &lt;build_dir&gt;/files/etc/config/wireless and build it successfully - my routed booted with wifi default ON<br />But when i tried to share my build with my friend who has an identical router his wireless was off.<br />I thought that my &quot;option &#039;mac_addr&#039; &quot; was the issue and i&#039;ve removed it and rebuild without it.<br />but after flashing my friend&#039;s router his wireless was still off.<br />Any ideas how to make this work?<br />Also what files should i copy from my working router to the default build to match my LED configuration?</p>									</div>

					<p>Copying your wireless config to his won&#039;t work, due to the MAC address as you rightly mentioned. Removing that line won&#039;t help. It&#039;s generated automatically by &quot;wifi detect&quot;.</p><p>One option for you would be to copy /etc/init.d/network to your files/ overlay and modify this script. You could change the line that calls &quot;wifi detect&quot; to be &quot;wifi detect | grep -v disabled&quot;. This would result in the device booting with wireless enabled (under the default SSID, and without any security though!).</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks sam<br />but the network script looks like:</p><p>boot() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; setup_switch() { return 0; }</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; include /lib/network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; setup_switch</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /sbin/wifi detect &gt; /tmp/wireless.tmp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ -s /tmp/wireless.tmp ] &amp;&amp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cat /tmp/wireless.tmp &gt;&gt; /etc/config/wireless<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rm -f /tmp/wireless.tmp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grep -qs config /etc/config/wireless &amp;&amp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /sbin/wifi up<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p><p>What and how exactly to modify?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maurer</strong> on 28 Sep 2011, 12:33)</p>

					<p>Far too complex. Simply use &quot;option phy phy0&quot; instead of &quot;option macaddr whatever&quot;.<br />Also never change stuff in build_dir - create a directory &quot;files&quot; in your buildroot topdir and place the wireless config there, e.g. &quot;files/etc/config/wireless&quot;</p>									</div>
