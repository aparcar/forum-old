					<p>Please draw me a picture since I don&#039;t seem to understand what you are trying to do. Are you trying to connect your openwrt router to another AP via WPS? If so you need wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli, and you need to configure a wifi_iface as a station &#039;sta&#039;.</p><p>If you are trying to get a WiFi client to connect to your OpenWrt AP, then you need to initiate WPS on your OpenWrt AP with: &#039;hostapd_cli wps_pbc&#039; and then initiate WPS on your client. </p><p>You might want to read up on both wpa_supplicant/wpa_cli and hostapd/hostapd_cli. Either way, draw me (us) a picture and we can help further. WPS is supposed to be very straight forward with OpenWrt.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>
