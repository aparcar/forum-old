					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;m using &quot;OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-149-g0d8bbd2 Release (git-15.363.78009-956be55)&quot; on a WD MyNet N600 Router (yeah, I know, I have a D-Link DIR-860L on order) with OpenVPN and a NordVPN connection.&nbsp; It drops regularly - I wrote a script to monitor it and log the data as a band-aid (I could restart the connection a few seconds faster by sending OpenVPN a SIGUSR1 at the right time), and I noticed something weird:</p><p>The drop-outs occurred every 15 minutes.&nbsp; Not only that, but on the 00, 15, &amp; 45 minutes of each hour - or just before that time.&nbsp; When the VPN started had no effect on this time at all.</p><p>I&#039;ve checked the crontab, and found nothing whatsoever.&nbsp; What am I missing?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>-Robert</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you post the system and kernel logs which cover at least 30-45 minutes of activity, so we can see what kind of messages there are in the logs regarding this.</p><p>I recall that the VPN implementations sometimes had problems with changing external IPs (i.e. a very short DHCP lease interval from your ISP), which did cause connection drops. Not sure if your problem has anything to do with that, but in my opinion it&#039;s good to point out issues that other people have had.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 13 Jan 2018, 11:24)</p>

					<p>Hello!</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I was putting together the logs you requested - &quot;clean&quot; ones without me fussing with the router while they ran - when I found another problem - one of my LAN networks couldn&#039;t ping their gateway, but they could get out and&nbsp; the gateway could ping them.&nbsp; I finally traced&nbsp; the problem to an &quot;ifup&quot; script for an OpenVPN connection that had two lines:</p><p>ip route add 172.16.1.1 dev tun0 table vpn<br />ip route add 172.16.1.0/24 dev tun0 table vpn</p><p>&quot;dev tun0&quot; is, of course, my VPN connection&#039;s interface.&nbsp; I looked at that a million times - the lines above and below it use the &quot;dev tun0&quot; correctly - and I missed it each time&nbsp; Changing that to &quot;dev eth0&quot; solved the ping problem, and - so far - the drop problem has not recurred.</p><p>I appreciate your help!</p><p>-Robert</p>									</div>
