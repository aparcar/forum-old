					<p>Hi, </p><p>I got a new TP-Link TL-WR741ND v2.1. in the wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd</a> I read that the version 2.1 is untested. I paid only 17â‚¬ so I tested it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I flashed trunk (r27122) for TL-WR741ND v1 through the oem-webinterface (without doing a factory reset). The router didn&#039;t reboot, and I wasn&#039;t able to access it. <br />After a poweroff (after 10min) I was able to access failsafe-mode but couldn&#039;t mount the jffs2-partiton, so I erased the jffs2-partition and after another reboot everything was working fine (LAN, WAN, WIFI).</p><p>So I would like to figure out why I had this issues. Is this &quot;normal&quot;, or would resetting the oem-firmware before flashing openwrt have fixed this problem?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I could modify the wiki but first I would like to figure out, if everyone else will face my upgrade-problems.</p><p>But as I said TP-Link TL-WR741ND Version 2.1 is working!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 7 Jun 2011, 15:51)</p>

					<p>I confirm the message above. Build r27256 also works, but with notices, exactly as described above: no reboot by itself, firstboot - in failsafe mode, fixing jffs by `firstboot` command.</p><p>Also in my case, i was forced to remove &quot;/etc/rc.d/S39usb&quot; to get it working properly.</p><p>Factory firmware was (according to page in original web interface):<br />Firmware Version: 3.12.4 Build 100910 Rel.57694n<br />Hardware Version: WR741N v1/v2 00000000</p><p>UPD: On the bottom label device marked as v2.1.</p><p>P.S.

					<p>hi, ad_user<br />good to know that this device really has these problems when upgrading. <br />I had no problems with sysupgrade from openwrt to openwrt, this happens only the first time when upgrading from stock-firmware to openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>@cconn<br />No, this operation only requires keep pressing (or even single press) &quot;QSS&quot; button during router&#039;s boot time.</p>									</div>
