					<p>We do have RB CRS226 CPU is QCA8519</p><p>we tried make menuconfig for atheros AR7XXX, AR9xx using diferent sources </p><p>am trying to install openwrt on a rb model CRS226 but after transfer image it does not boot<br />initially we used an image for ar71xx mikrotik<br />Serial connection shows image transfer and then jumping to elf image ok then when starting the kernel it hangs<br />Router has a QCA8519 CPU a Qualcomm re-branded Atheros 8xxx series i believe<br />We do not have it as target system on menuconfig<br />so we&nbsp; try compiling for AR9xxx target and set Atheros AR7XXX/AR9XXX on menuconfig and as subtarget mikrotic devices with NAND </p><p>We also tried a generic the generic precompiled image from downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/mikrotik/</p><p>It looks like this RB is unsupportable until the cpu has been reverse engineered maybe</p><p>i take we are using the provided cross compiler and stuff and maybe this mikrotik board deviates slightly from the generic designs used by the TP Link etc<br />and we need to make our own cross</p><p>We already tried to built our own cross but target system on menuconfig has not many available and clear options apart from Ath 7xxx/9xxx</p><p>openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-mikrotik-vmlinux.lzma etc are all presumably compiled with OpenWrt-SDK-15.05.1-ar71xx-mikrotik_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2.Linux-x86_64.tar.bz2</p><p>so for us using our own cross means you have to do it all again</p><p>and so far I can&#039;t even find any datasheet for that chip as well</p><p>i&#039;ve looked for the qca9558 as well, and there is some information but they&#039;re tight lipped</p><p>we didn&#039;t you use the SDK above when compiling the kernel</p><p>we believe there&#039;s a cross compiler option in the make menuconfig that it asks for a prefix. in general setup there should be a menu entry that says cross compiler prefix? (or there is when you are typing make menuconfig in a regular linux kernel directory) and as well that if we do download that linaro cross compiler, and hopefully if those binaries run on our machine, we could use the prefix of that compiler and then run the compilation</p><p>1) So at this point it seems the path to try is to download the linaro cross compiler But we do not found the link </p><p>2) Use linaro to run the compilation we are using gcc.</p><p>3) Check if there is a cross compiler option prefix option there in make menuconfig, under general setup option. </p><p>we are not sure how openwrt is setup by default when it comes to someone making their own kernel, or selecting their own kernel options but we are looking at the links below. </p><p>We are not also very knowledgeable on this subject as well. Please do apologize if its trivial for you guys</p><p>wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/crosscompile<br />wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.sdk</p><br /><p>Can anyone give us an help with this.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
