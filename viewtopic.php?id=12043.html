					<p>Hi,</p><p>Just loaded White Russian on a WL-500gP and got some questions...</p><p>1) I want a wireless connection between a WRT54G 5.0 (internet connected router using Linksys firmware) so that I can access the WL-500gP from work. I will be trying to access a Perl script on the WL-500gP to view images from webcam and sends commands to a Roomba robot to move.&nbsp; Which mode would I want?&nbsp; I am guessing &#039;client with wet rather than sta&#039;. Am I right?&nbsp; &nbsp;I will need WPA PSK too--hope it is supported. </p><p>2) The WRT54G is 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; The WL-500gP wil be 192.168.1.111.&nbsp; For the Default Gateway value in OpenWrt, do I use the internal address of 192.168.1.1 or the external IP which is 64.x.x.x?</p><p>3) I had to load White Russian using the Windows O/S firmware kit after repeatedly trying to load Kamikaze. I could flash it could never access it .&nbsp; Should I be trying to move to Kamikaze or is White Rissian still alive?</p><p>4) In regards to NVRAM, are all the options accessible from the GUI?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>5) Somewhere I saw mention of a WL-500gP V2.&nbsp; Anyone seen that and what is it referring to?&nbsp; I just got mine from NewEgg yesterday.&nbsp; Could it be V2?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Rich</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>flowersrj</strong> on 12 Aug 2007, 15:13)</p>
