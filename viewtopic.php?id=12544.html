					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using Kamikaze for a WGT634U. Using make menuconfig, I asked it to compile several kernel support as modules instead of bundling it in the kernel. I have noticed that some modules are installed on the generated filesystem, while some are not. For example, usbcore is installed while videodev is not. So who does control that, and how can I configure that.</p><p>Thanks!<br />Laurent.</p>									</div>
