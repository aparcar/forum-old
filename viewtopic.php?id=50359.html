					<p>A while ago we got a new internet connection. For a while we used dd-wrt but with the new internet connection we were asked to connect via a pppoe connection and it seemed dd-wrt was no good at that. So here I am now on openwrt. </p><p>Every thing seems nice except for one thing. When ever I do a grc port scan test several ports show as stealth. When I do test of internet speed I connect directly through the modem to the net with my laptop and when I do a grc port scan test it shows no such results. So if the modem is not to blame than it must be the router.</p><p>I do not know what that is so. I have not opened any of those ports that it shows as open nor have I do none any wired configurations since I am pretty new to openwrt. Neither are there any other computers online at the time of the tests and I am on linus so no crazy windows machines on my LAN.</p><p>I really want to get to the bottom of this. This has really started to make me worried and if I can not resolve this I may have to try some thing else instead like tomato.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zopico</strong> on 29 Apr 2014, 10:03)</p>
