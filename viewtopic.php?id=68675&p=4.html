					<p>So I compiled an firmware image with luci and some other pakets included. The one thing that doesn&#039;t seem to work is dhcp relaying with dnsmasq. I use the same configuration that I also used sucessfully with dnsmassq 2.73 (this now is 2.76), but instead of sending the answer from the dhcp server to the client, dnsmasq sends it on the openvpn tun interface with the tunnel ip as the sender, so it doesn&#039;t get to the client.<br />Anybody had the same problem (and a possible fix)?</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not exactly easy, you need brute hex editing, on top of that you need to build your own image with ART unlocked, else you won&#039;t be able to flash ART. Here&#039;s one such image for v4(sysupgrade):&nbsp; <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2CQR48oiPa5UXRVSVYwQzBSVlk/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2CQR4 … sp=sharing</a></p><p>See this: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=300089#p300089">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 89#p300089</a>&nbsp; Downoad the ART linked there, but don&#039;t flash it, it&#039;s for wdr 4300, you also need to download this: <a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/ar9300_eeprom/blob/master/art/wdr3600_v1.1_2050500231_rev1.0_pl.bin">https://github.com/pepe2k/ar9300_eeprom … 1.0_pl.bin</a></p><p>Open both those in hex editor, then use windiff or something to see what was changed in the first one(the 2nd one is the original). Back up your art: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/dev/mtd4 of=/tmp/orig_art.bin</code></pre></div><p>Then transfer it out of the router to your computer, and don&#039;t lose it, you will need it later. Open it in hex editor, then modify it the same way as the one for wdr 4300 was modified. Save it under art.bin name(so you don&#039;t lose the original), transfer it to /tmp folder on the router, then run </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r write art.bin art</code></pre></div><p> (You need to flash the openwrt with unlocked ART for this to work) Then the router will reboot, you should be able to set 28 dBm power(higher tx powers could appear, but they will just transmit at 28dBm), I suggest to change your country to 00 world to be able to set 28 dBm on any channel.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>user5077</strong> on 1 Jun 2017, 14:56)</p>

					<p>Hi! This is the first time I&#039;ll play with OpenWRT.<br />I&#039;m about to buy this router, 1034nd but I&#039;m not exactly sure which version to buy.<br />Should I buy v3 or v4?</p><p>Actually my questions are the following.<br />1) if I buy the v4 should I download and install this one via the ui upgrade procedure?

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I bricked my router during flashing process. The failsafe mode seems not working for this one with reset button. Has anyone ever tried to unbrick the v4 version to give me some hints. I worked with the v2 and v3 versions before and the failsafe was always working for them.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>									</div>

					<p>I was successful in installing OpenWRT on TL-WR1043ND v4. I found out that WAN LED should have two colors (green and orange) available. Orange WAN LED color flashes once when router is started, but here is no info or control possibility of orange color WAN either in OpenWRT device info page or OpenWRT itself. Is this a &quot;new feature&quot; of v4? Can someone who has of earlier HW versions tell if they can see orange WAN LED flash once on startup?</p>									</div>
