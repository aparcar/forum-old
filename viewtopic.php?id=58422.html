					<p>I am trying to diagnose a strange problem.&nbsp; My ISP has provided a router (KW5262) that can be configured in bridge mode as well as a router.&nbsp; It works fine as a router.&nbsp; When I set it up in bridge mode and try to use my OpenWRT router for PPPoE, I see my OpenWRT router try to establish the connection.&nbsp; Then one end or the other takes down the ethernet link, bring it right back up, and OpenWRT tries to authenticate again.</p><p>For ever.</p><p>Link goes down, link comes up, start pppd, link goes down.</p><p>There&#039;s nothing useful in the logs that I can find but I am not at all familiar with pppoe so I don&#039;t know what to look for. I posted an image at <a href="http://www.seiner.com/cz/pppoelog.jpg">http://www.seiner.com/cz/pppoelog.jpg</a></p><p>For those of you running PPPoE, can you shed any insight into this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Normally, those devices will handle the PPPoE connection even in bridged mode; your OpenWRT router will receive a public IP address, and you do not need to stablish the PPPoE connection yourself.</p>									</div>
