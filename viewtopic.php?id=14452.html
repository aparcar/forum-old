					<p>I&#039;ve current got two Buffalo WHR-HP-54G units running<br />WhiteRussian.&nbsp; One is an AP/firewall/router, the other is<br />configured as a bridge.&nbsp; Now I need a second bridge, and find<br />that I can&#039;t get another Buffalo.</p><p>I don&#039;t see any APs at newegg.com that are listed as supported. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>What hardware do people recommend for use as a bridge?</p>									</div>

					<p>I settled on a Linksys WRT54GL.&nbsp; Same chipset as the Buffalo,<br />and buy.com has them for $53 (after rebate) with free shipping.<br />I&#039;d prefer to avoid the RTNC connectors that Linksys uses on<br />that model (all my antennas are set up for RSMA), but I can<br />cope.&nbsp; Buffalo WHR-HP-54G units are selling for quite a premium<br />on eBay.&nbsp; It looks like they are averaging around $75-$80 plus<br />$10 shipping.&nbsp; Newegg always used to have them for $60-$65 plus<br />$5 shipping.</p>									</div>

					<p>Worked like a charm.&nbsp; It&#039;s in use as a bridge, and it sure<br />beats spending $80 on a bridge -- if you can find one -- and<br />then finding out it doesn&#039;t support WAP authentication<br />(apparently many of the current bridges on the market don&#039;t<br />support WAP).</p>									</div>
