					<p>Hi, I want to debrick my EA6300v1, but I got stuck. Can anyone provide me any helpful information?</p><p>Here is what I did that brick it:<br />1. Download the trx file at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/linksys/linksys_ea6300_v1">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/lin … _ea6300_v1</a><br />2. Go to 192.168.1.1 (with stock firmware), at &quot;Firmware upgdate&quot;, choose the downloaded trx file<br />3. At half way, the router ask me to rebook, so I click the&nbsp; &quot;reboot&quot; button<br />4. The LED of the router stay on but my computer can not connect to it<br />5. Reboot the router, the LED flashes. DHCP doesn&#039;t work, but if you set your ip manually to 192.168.1.2 and ping 192.168.1.1, you will get a response with TTL=100</p><p>I have tried to use the tftp to recover it, but it doesn&#039;t work at all... I want to use serial or JTAG, but I can not find where to connect the cables...</p><p>Please see <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/skE7rKX98xHtDFik6">https://goo.gl/photos/skE7rKX98xHtDFik6</a> for photos of my router. Can anyone tell me where is the JTAG or TX,RX,GND for serial from the photos?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zasdfgbnm</strong> on 14 Aug 2016, 07:08)</p>

But I didn&#039;t try the 30-30-30, because some other material says don&#039;t do that on EA models. But I don&#039;t thinks my case is better than after 30-30-30... It seems that only boot loader is running and the boot loader don&#039;t accept my tftp...</p>									</div>
