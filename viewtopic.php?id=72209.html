					<p>I have an openwrt router that succesfully connects to a public hotspot.<br />Because the hotspot has a captive portal, I have created a script, within the router, that authenticates the router to the captive portal/hotspot. Thanks to the unbridged configuration, all devices connecting to my router are able to access internet without authentication.<br />Till here, everything works fine.</p><p>I want to create a VPN connection from a local device (connected to the openwrt router) to a remote router (on internet) that acts as VPN server.<br />It works when the device is connected to internet from other locations.<br />It does not work in this unbridged repeating mode.</p><p>Is there something I can try on the openwrt router to let it work?<br />(port forwarding, disable firewall, static route, dmz, ???)<br />I am not so expert in networking ...</p><p>What I don&#039;t want to do is to bridge the repeater because I would loose the advantage of having the router authenticating for all appended devices.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
