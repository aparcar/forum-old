					<p>I&#039;ve been happily using Linksys WRT54GL for almost a decade until it stopped working just recently. I&#039;m looking for a replacement which I hope will serve me for as long as that. I&#039;d like it to work steadily for months with no hangs, so I won&#039;t need to reboot the router. I&#039;d like to have 802.11ac capability and possibility to reflash the firmware to openwrt or other open source firmware is highly desirable. That said, my main requirements are good uptime, stable speed and support for new 802.11ac standard as I want to use my router comfortably rather than tinker with it. What would you suggest me?</p>									</div>
