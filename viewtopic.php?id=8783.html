					<p>OK I gave up my last project, and want to try something easier now!<br />I have successfully loaded OpenWrt on to my U.S. Robotics 5461 and it includes these packages<br />base-files<br />base-files-brcm<br />bridge<br />busybox<br />dropbear<br />haserl<br />ipkg<br />iptables<br />iwlib<br />kmod-brcm-wl<br />kmod-diag<br />kmod-ipt-nat-default<br />kmod-switch<br />kmod-wlcompat<br />mtd<br />nvram<br />uclibc<br />webif<br />wificonf<br />wireless-tools<br />wl</p><p>I am trying to get it to become a bridge, basically the 5461 will connect to my other router via wifi, and bridge that to its own LAN ports (maybe even the WAN port too.)&nbsp; I have tried following this guide<br /><a href="http://woz.gs/wifi/openwrtbridge.html">http://woz.gs/wifi/openwrtbridge.html</a></p><p>But the NVRAM resets after reboot for some reason!&nbsp; I have even tried to write nvram commit after EVERY CHANGE but it still resets.&nbsp; Would that tutorial even work, and how do I get the router to ACTUALLY write to the NVRAM?</p>									</div>
