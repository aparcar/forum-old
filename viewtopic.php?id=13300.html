					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve been searching this forum to see if anyone has tried removing the wifi Mini PCI card from say a WL500 and swapped it with a different type of card, such as a GSM/GPRS card.</p><p>Main reason for doing this is I want a router with a WAN plus GPRS/3G backup. I&#039;ve looked at the WRT54G3G, but i would really like to hide the GPRS/3G card inside the unit.</p><p>Any ideas ? Does this sound possible ?</p><p>Thanks<br />John</p>									</div>

					<p>You could consider modifying the wl500 and place the usb ports on the inside, and use a 3G usb modem - and get to keep wlan.</p><p>edit: possibly, if you can find a usb modem that is emulating a serial port you could hook it up to the internal serial header too, that might limit your speed to 115k which probably defies the point of 3G.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>beikeland</strong> on 8 Nov 2007, 04:56)</p>
