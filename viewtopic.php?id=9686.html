					<p>Hi,<br />I have a Seagate pocket hard disk (2.5GB) that I have attached to one of my Asus wl500gP boxes.&nbsp; Its all a nice neat package and will replace my experimental device which is using a 1.0GB flash drive to run XMail &amp; also runs Lighhtpd /php server and webmail interface - which is working very well.</p><p>Because I now have a HDD I can probably also create a swap partition (which would have added stress to the flash drive I previously used)... my question is:</p><p>Will I gain any benefit by activating a swap partition on the HHD?</p><p>The Pocket drive is partitioned to have about 1.5GB in ext3 and about 700M in a FAT partition in case I need to escape out to a Windows box... I have left a few MBs in reserve to use as swap... Is swap a good idea?</p><p>Thanks &amp; regards,</p><p>Chris</p>									</div>

					<p>That depends strongly upon your workload. With the basic OpenWRT setup, you won&#039;t notice to much of a difference. First there is enough memory to satisfy all programs, and second the programs running are all so small and minimal, that there is not much fat that could get swapped out without penalty. (Standard Linux boxes often swap out the getty processes, and other unused stuff, but OpenWRT is to lean for that)</p><p>If you run heavier workloads on the box, you probably should add swap, but no matter what you do, the Asus only has 32MB RAM. If you really have a workload that needs more memory you can do only one thing, take a fast Flash-USB drive, and use that for swap. (That&#039;s similiar how Vista is &quot;stealing&quot; memory to run acceptably). The drawback is, that depending upon usage your flash drive might get used up someday. (Flash USB sticks should manage their chips so that overwriting the same block all the time maps the block to different flash chips over time. OTOH Flash USB sticks are not really a brand-name high-price product nowadays.)</p><p>yacc</p>									</div>
