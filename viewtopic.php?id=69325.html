					<p>Hi guys, <br />I have loaded chaos calmer with nodogsplash on a Ubiquity Nano Loco M2. </p><p>Currently the nodogsplash works perfectly with the standard setup. I have now included an iframe to authenticate using an external Facebook log in using javascript, however the iframe loads the nodogsplash splash page in the iframe. When I click on the splash within the iframe, I am able to see the external site as needed. </p><p>I have tried editing /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf to allow pre authenticated users access to the IP of the external website, as per the instructions in the file but the problem persists. </p><p>Please can some assist with the correct code to be added to the /config/nodogsplash file to allow access for the iframe.</p>									</div>
