					<p>Ive played with SQM scripts and mostly set something wrong, set eth0.1 for the Interface and now I cannot connect to my router anymore. It Comes up a few seconds after boot, can ping, and the momeht /etc/init.d/sqm is loaded I guess, it breaks.</p><p>The Problem now is, failsafe doesnt work... I am sure the device is in failsafe, when it&#039;s booting and the power LED blinks in slow mode, I press reset button hold it 2 seconds and power LED Switches to fast blinking. But the router isnt reachable at 192.168.1.1 (of course Client is set to 192.168.1.2). What can I do now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> The router is a Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H. Any reason why the ip shouldnt be 192.168.1.1 in ist failsafe mode? I also tried 192.168.11.1 and some others, but it nevers works.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to flash via the command &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/openwrt-lantiq-xway-WBMR-squashfs.image linux&quot; from the ram image loaded via tftp and the router is working again. However, the failsafe mode doesnt work on this device. Ive opened a bug report but no devs answered to it.</p><p>I dont understand why OpenWRT hasnt a working and safe method to reset the config directory to default like every normal consumer home router has you can buy. Yes a failsafe mode you can boot into is a great thing and even better than just a config reset, but shown here it can lead to problems. Why not add a 2nd reset option next to failsafe, something like holding reset button which every device has for 20 seconds or so and a script deletes and replaces the config directory with default values. Theres even an option for this already (firstboot), but it&#039;s not bound to a hardware button toggle sequence.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 20 Sep 2014, 20:24)</p>
