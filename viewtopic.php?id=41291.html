					<p>Not sure if it will help, but try putting sleep 10 (or whatever works) after the wget<br />I don&#039;t really know the nitty gritty of wget, but it seems to be acting as if it is a background process. Maybe the sleep will allow it to complete before cycling through the while loop.</p>									</div>

					<p>there must be a better way than that. I had been thinking about it, but got sidetracked. What about writing to a file, and having your client download it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well the server is already set up to work this way and we don&#039;t want to change it if possible. It does work by the way, it half works. My database person is working on a web page to show what happens on that side and i will post it as soon as its ready within the next few minutes hopefully.</p><p>my last post, when you saw it run 3 times then i killed it, the first time it posted the temperature, then after that just garbage info as i would expect for the next two posts. so it did work but not when it gets run as a cron job, the job runs but it doesn&#039;t post to the server every minute like its supposed to.</p><p>how would what your saying work? do you have a code example?</p><p>what about this: </p><p>OUT=temp<br />while true ; do<br />digitemp_DS9097 -a -q -o &quot;%4.1C&quot; &gt; $OUT<br />wget -tries=1 -O /dev/null &quot;<a href="http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/get.php?t=$temp">http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/get.php?t=$temp</a>&quot;<br />done</p><p>probably garbage ^ lol i just saw something else out there and it looked interesting so i modified it but i dont have much faith in it. i didnt try it yet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thel33tone</strong> on 27 Dec 2012, 23:24)</p>

					<p>temp is 32 then 74? lolz.<br />I was thinking more like write the digitemp to a file (local, overwriting previous), then from the client side doing a wget of the file.<br />Really just chucking things out there really.</p><p>EDIT:<br />rationale being there is always a file that makes sense and wget can do whatever until it gets that sensible file</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robthebrew</strong> on 27 Dec 2012, 19:07)</p>

					<p>heh, the temperature gets converted on the server from C to F so 0 (null) gets put to 32 F. we changed that though so it would read 0 if it gets bad or no data. anyways here is the fix!:</p><p>temp=$(digitemp_DS9097 -a -q -o&quot;%4.1C&quot;)<br />/usr/bin/wget -tries=1 -O /dev/null &quot;<a href="http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/get.php?t=$temp">http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/get.php?t=$temp</a>&quot;</p><p>and the kicker was that you need to use vi at the shell. under vi you need to clean up the junk that got added when i uploaded the script via ftp. also make sure to use notepad++ because some other editors add junk too to the raw file. thank you for your help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thel33tone</strong> on 27 Dec 2012, 23:24)</p>
