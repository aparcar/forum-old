All the other firmwares allow me to monitor ALL the interfaces!</p><p>This was a well thought-out decision, and there are several reasons for this. Basically, bandwidth between local hosts on a LAN is almost always plentiful and cheap. Typically one person/organization owns all of the hardware and networking cable involved. Bandwidth to remote hosts, however tends to be slow and expensive. You have to pay a monthly fee for your internet connection and many ISPs are now implementing bandwidth caps. It is therefore almost always more useful to know how much bandwidth is being used on the WAN interface rather than on the local network or the combined bandwidth.</p><p>Of course, if there wasn&#039;t a trade-off involved there would be no reason not to include all interfaces. However, the bandwidth monitor takes up memory and disk space proportional to the number of different things it is monitoring. In order to be able to monitor static ips, upload qos classes and download qos classes a lot of memory is necessary and will strain the limits of some systems. The reason other interfaces are not monitored is because I think it is usually more useful to have more complete data on the WAN interface than significantly less data on all the interfaces.</p></blockquote></div><p>1) bandwidth between local hosts on a LAN is almost always plentiful and cheap<br/>That&#039;s correct. BUT:&nbsp; I need to monitor traffic between LAN ports (and Wi-Fi interfaces) in order to test several variants of deployment scenarios.<br/>If you have Windows PC, it&#039;s rather difficult to understand what is real transfer rate to/out of Windows PC, either via Wired or Wireless connection.<br/>And I can&#039;t avoid using Windows PCs for some networks, as some people are sticked to their Windows XP.<br/>(like teachers in my kid&#039;s school)<br/>It would take some time to move them to Linux, and this would not happen in one day</p><p>2) Bandwidth to remote hosts, however tends to be slow and expensive. You have to pay a monthly fee for your internet connection and many ISPs are now implementing bandwidth caps</p><p>I moved to Unlimited tariff with my ISP.&nbsp; I have symmetric 15Mbit/sec. to Internet, and 100Mbit to provider&#039;s local network<br/>This allows to upload on average 60GB per day via Torrent. I don&#039;t need that much for downloading.</p><p>3) bandwidth monitor takes up memory and disk space proportional to the number of different things it is monitoring.<br/>Typical router has 32MB of RAM. And&nbsp; at least 4MB of flash - if you are ready to spend at least $40 for your new router.<br/>So in my opinion RAM or Flash is not a limitation at all.</p><p>P.S. I raised question on <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=790#p4374">Gargoyle forum</a><br/>&nbsp; Feel free to join and comment :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>The biggest change is the new LuCI interface. It&#039;s a lot easier to work with, IMHO. There are a few bug fixes for various things. In this build, I&#039;ve noticed some minor issues with running in N mode. My cell phone drops off the wifi on occasion, but when running the router in G only mode, it&#039;s more stable. YMMV.</p><p>When making changes to the network settings, everything comes back up correctly, now. In the old build, you had to manually reset the WAN, IIRC.</p>									</div>
