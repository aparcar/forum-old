					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I intend to buy an Asus wl 500g premium router and I need your advice.</p><p>My&nbsp; ISP has a strange policy about sharing the internet connection through a router and made me lot of trouble. At this time, to have an internet connection available, I have to run on my Windows XP a custom application where I should type my username and password for accessing the net. They provide also a script to be run by the Linux users. Another problem is that the packages have the TTL=1.</p><p>So my question for you is:<br />-is it possible to install on the router the following packages: libmcrypt 2.5.7, PHP-CLI 5.1.2, Zend 2.6.2 and GNU Wget 1.10.2?<br />-is it possible by using iptables to increase the TTL to avoid the problem about passing the packages through the router?</p><p>Because I&#039;m a begginer, it could be very useful for me some details about how to compile the sources and then install those on the router.</p><p>Many thanks,</p><p>Liviu</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the same problem with my ISP. I have to increase TTL to share the connection. My voip router Linksys WRTP54G-EU has not a function to change TTL value. I found several firmware images here on OpenWRT site: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTP54G?highlight=%28CategoryModel%29">click</a><br />How can I find if any of those firmwares contains TTL function?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>r-tea</strong> on 15 Jun 2007, 22:04)</p>

					<p>I have always wondered if ISPs monitor the TTL.&nbsp; You can use iptables to force the ttl to a certain value.&nbsp; You might be careful though, because there are other ways for your ISP to tell you are running NAT.</p><p>EDIT: By the way, this has been discussed before: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=29407">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=29407</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netprince</strong> on 16 Jun 2007, 00:58)</p>

					<p>you can mangle the TTL values via iptables -</p><p>ipkg install iptables-mod-ipopt<br />iptables -j TTL -h</p><p>then edit the firewall scripts appropriately</p>									</div>
