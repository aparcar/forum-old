					<p>I just ordered a refurbished Trendnet TEW-732BR with the intent to install new open source firmware.<br />The latest stable OpenWrt firmware uses OpenSSL 1.0.2g and there have been several cve&#039;s and subsequent updates</p><br /><p>dd-wrt is using a newer OpenSSL version but does not have a build for the TEW-732BR.&nbsp; They do have a build for a TP-Link WR841N v8 with the same Atheros SoC: AR9341.&nbsp; The flash and ram are smaller for the TP-Link so I think I would have to rebuild the dd-wrt WR841ND V8 image for the larger flash memory.</p><p>I could not find the snapshot changelog so what version of OpenSSL is being used?</p><p>Never mind - found it on github.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 1 Jan 2017, 19:49)</p>
