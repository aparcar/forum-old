					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Hoping someone can help point me in the right direction here.</p><p>I have 2 routers, 1st running DD-WRT , 2nd running OpenWRT.</p><p>1st router uses 192.168.1.0/24 subnet for both wireless and wired devices. 2nd is running a separate guest wireless network on 10.0.1.0/24 subnet. This is working fine, so that the devices connected wirelessly cannot see the wired or wireless devices on the main router. I used the guest WLAN guide to create this.</p><p>The last piece I&#039;m trying to accomplish is to allow my wired devices on my 2nd router to be assigned to the same subnet as my main router, so 192.168.1.0/24. I&#039;ve tried a couple things, including connecting the 2nd router to the 1st via LAN ports on both, but then I lose network connectivity on my wireless network. </p><p>I&#039;m not sure if I should be trying to get them all assigned to the same subnet, or if I can just allow them to be on different subnets but make them visible to each other. All the guides I&#039;ve seen reference connecting the 2 routers wirelessly, but I am able to connect via ethernet cable so would like to utilize this method instead.</p><p>Can anyone give me some info on how to get this started?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Second router should have tree interfaces: WAN (connected to first router), LAN (connected to wired computers), and WLAN (connected to wireless computers).</p><p>Now you want to bridge WAN and LAN together, so wired clients have a direct connection to the main router (depending on your hardware, this can be done directly on the internal switch); on this (bridge) interface, the second router should probably be a DHCP client, but never a DHCP server.</p><p>The WLAN interface should not be part of the bridge; it needs a fixed IP address (different range than the main router) and must be a DHCP server. Then, forwarding and masquerading must be enabled between the WLAN and the WAN/LAN interface (pretty much as you would do if the device was connected to the internet).</p><p>Hope this helps, do not hesitate to ask for further details.</p>									</div>
