					<p>Hi,</p><p>I was habited to setup client mode on Asus WL500b via proprietary wl tool (using wl.o, et.o).<br />Everything I needed was (applicable to eth2):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wl ap 0        #Set client mode
wl scan        #Scan for APs in neighbourhood
wl scanresults #Display results of the scan
wl join  xxxx  #Join selected AP
(wl assoc)     #Verify that I&#039;m associated with AP</code></pre></div><p>In current snap, there are modules wl.o and wlcompat.o.<br />I was not able to insert et.o (message like: &quot;module_init: no such device&quot;)<br />I have tried to install wl from third party ipk package, but has not worked (mesages like: &quot;eth2 unsupported...&quot;)<br />I have tried iw* utilities, but either not supported or not found any equivalent commands like in wl. I need exactly equivalents for these five commands as above.</p><p>I don&#039;t like magicall setings via nvram variables and these variables at all, because I can&#039;t see who reads/use/modify it at all and when. There is a big mess in them. The scripts are (by my opinion) too complex for my purposes.</p><p><strong>The questions are:</strong><br /><em><br />It there possibility to build (???link only from binary modules against current libc???) wl ipk package during building the openwrt? (I couldn&#039;t find it in my tree).<br />Is there a possibility to have oldschool wl for settings described above?<br />If yes, what I did wrong that I have some errors about &quot;unsupported&quot; and so on?</em></p><p><em>What does wifi command? <br />It&#039;s open? <br />Does it use any nvram variables?<br /></em></p><p>Feel free to kick me to any links with information.<br />If you use similar HW in client mode: internet from wifi side (eth2, dhcp client), lan on switch side (eth0, dhcp server), please describe your method of setting.</p><p>If you use nvram magic only and understand it exactly, feel free to describe it in detail (advice like: set this, this and this variable to these values and reboot is not sufficient for me. I need to understand and prepare my simplified version)</p><p><strong>THANK YOU</strong></p><p>I appologize for not accurate messages and description. <br />I have either old working FW or new (still) not working FW without internet access. <br />And my access to router is limited.</p><p>If you find this message stupid/useless/redundant please try to tell it briefly or via mail, thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, but I still dont know nothing about the background.</p><p>What/who does use the wl0_mode?<br />What/who does use the wl0_ssid?<br />What associates with wl0_ssid?</p><p>Does this need complicated user scripts like /sbin/ifup /sbin/ifdown?<br />What is the next dependency in the nvram (if any)?</p><p>Does &quot;anything&quot; monitor nvram for changes? Waiting for commit? <br />What if connection from provider is temporarily unavailable? I want to simply restore connection without restart.</p><p>It&#039;s too much questions for me ;(</p>									</div>

					<p>wl0_mode will adjust radio mode - ap, sta and wet.<br />wl0_ssid is SSID the radio will use.<br />ifup/ifdown does use these nvram values.<br />nvram commit will put nvram changes to the NVRAM, but there is no need to it if you just want to test new values.</p>									</div>

					<p>See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtNVRAM">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtNVRAM</a> for details of the NVRAM settings - I&#039;ve just edited this to try to make it clearer.</p><p><strong>wl0_*</strong> applies to the <em>physical</em> wireless interface. Typing &quot;wifi&quot; (from wificonf package) will read all these settings and send them to the wifi hardware as ioctls (which is, I believe, basically what wl did).</p><p><strong>wifi_*</strong> settings are passed to ifconfig and/or brctl to configure the IP interface. Typing &quot;ifup wifi&quot; will run all the necessary commands to configure the IP interface. The name &quot;wifi&quot; is arbitary, but wifi_ifname binds it to the IP interface name as known to the kernel.</p><p>When you type &quot;nvram set foo=bar&quot; you are just changing an in-RAM copy of the settings, which these scripts will read. &quot;nvram commit&quot; copies this in-RAM copy back to the non-volatile storage.</p><p>If you want to continue using wl, which is closed source, then install it from the &quot;non-free&quot; distribution area: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/non-free/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussi â€¦ /non-free/</a> - it works for me(TM),&nbsp; but I&#039;m using Asus WL-500g Deluxe, which is a different model to yours.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/ClientModeHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/ClientModeHowto</a> is probably also of interest to you.</p><p>HTH, Brian.</p>									</div>
