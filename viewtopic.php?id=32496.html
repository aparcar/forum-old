					<p>Is 6368 support now possible? I&#039;ve been researching this for a week now, but still haven&#039;t found a solid answer.</p><p>I came across this page:</p><p><a href="http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/linux-mips/2011-06/msg00161.html">http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/linu â€¦ 00161.html</a></p><p>Which appears to be a Linux kernel patch recommendation for the Broadcom BCM6368 chip. I say it is a recommendation as I do not see it committed in any of the more recent kernel releases since June.</p><p>As I&#039;m a complete OpenWRT noob (although I&#039;ve fallen madly in love with it), I can&#039;t tell yet if the image build process can allow for one to modify the kernel to insert this patch. (I&#039;m working it)</p><p>Does anyone know if a) the patch can be applied during a OpenWRT build process, and b) if it is likely that a patch could be used or if the patch needs to be committed to the official kernel source tree for support to occur in OpenWRT?</p><p>Any Info would be appreciated!</p><p>-cr0wnf15h</p><p>Target Router = ZyXEL P-870HN-51b - Broadcom BCM6368 w/ wireless Broadcom BCM4322</p>									</div>

					<p>These patches were rejected because of several coding issues and are currently waiting for resubmission.</p><p>While it is possible to use them with OpenWrt (with a bit of effort), you won&#039;t have much fun with it, as ethernet support is missing. Also dependng on the type of flash of your device, you might get further problems (only parallel flash is supported, but neither nand nor serial).</p><p>KM</p>									</div>
