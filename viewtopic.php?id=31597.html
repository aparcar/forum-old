					<p>Greeting guys ,</p><p>I was wondering if there is any way to change/delete some files in a .bin image (for a dir-601) , squashfs file system.<br />i need to delete some unwanted files in order to create more space...<br />I would build-up a brand new image , but just dont know the exact file i need for the router to work, so i figured that just deleting from an already existing image would be te best way to make sur i got the good image and stuff...and since squashfs is read-only , i cant delete file directly on the router.</p><p>Thanks a lot !</p>									</div>
