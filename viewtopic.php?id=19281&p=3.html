					<p>Hi all, firstly thanks to all for your hard work in getting openwrt to work with the dir-615. I&#039;m having trouble with the latest image posted by omgwtfbbq. I&#039;m getting the following errors in dmesg on a dir-615 D4:<br />phy0 -&gt; rt2800_init_eeprom: Error - Invalid RF chipset detected.<br />phy0 -&gt; rt2x00lib_probe_dev: Error - Failed to allocate device.</p><br /><p>Can I ask what patches you included, if any, or whether it was just a build of the latest trunk code? The last build I built had working wireless but without the encryption being available.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Datty, check my post on the bottom of the previous page.<br />Compat-wireless report RF chip ID 0x0c on my DIR-615 D3.<br />Chip with that ID is not supported by the driver but it seems to be compatible with RF3022 which <strong>is</strong> supported (ID 0x08).</p><p>I don&#039;t know if rev D4 has the same RF chip, you will have to identify it first.<br />Try to enable debugging in rt2x00 drivers config before compiling and also make sure your build supports dmesg.<br />After you upload your new firmware, call dmesg and look for ID of your RF chip.</p><p>EDIT: The ID has magically changed from 0x0c to 0x00 with the latest updates to trunk.<br />Which means my tutorial on the previous page needs minor modification:</p><p>13. Open ./build_dir/linux-ramips_rt305x/compat-wireless-2010-09-14/drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2800.h in yout favourite text editor, find &#039;#define RF3022&#039; (line 57) and change its value from &#039;0x0008&#039; to &#039;0x0000&#039;.

					<p>Thanks for getting back to me. I&#039;ve rebuilt the latest trunk with the change you suggested and it works perfectly(WPA2). Only the final hurdle of wifi-n to get through now but I guess thats down to the guys writing the driver. Hopefully won&#039;t be too long but at least its working to some extent!</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>

					<p>Another step in wireless driver development.</p><p>The driver can now be compiled without any modifications to chip IDs, RF3022 is recognised automatically.</p><p>802.11n is almost working (both channel widths 20/40MHz).<br />Client can successfully connect to the AP and recieve DHCP info, even correct speeds (144/300mbps) are reported.<br />Then the connection hangs.</p><p>We will have fully functional N mode very soon.<br />For now, use G mode, it works just fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I&#039;m also very interested in this project. I have some OEM boxes from China with the RT3050, 4MB of Flash, and 16MB of RAM. I&#039;ll be downloading from the trunk and following your instructions. Hopefully I can be of some help moving forward. At a minimum, I&#039;m a test engineer, so when everything comes together with the 802.11n support, I can put it through it&#039;s paces and report back.</p><p>Good work everyone, thanks!</p><p>Shawn</p>									</div>

I think you must have your settings mixed up or something or just a bad revision, but 802.11n *is* working with Openwrt on this device.</p><p>I&#039;ve got N mode working fine with a recent trunk build (r24805) with up to 144mbs, even with your old build from August (r22733) I had working N mode - though it was running poorly and without encryption but certainly working at above 54mbps speeds. Interestingly your &quot;54mbps working&quot; build (r23074) doesn&#039;t detect the wireless at all on my device.</p><p>As for the 144mbps on DD-WRT - some say that&#039;s a feature not a bug. 300mbps works, but turns itself off when it detects interference, which WiFi spec says it should do, but it might be doing so a bit too sensitively. It only applies to builds &gt;15xxx, build 14xxx and below have 300mbps working fine even under heavy interference conditions. I think the updated driver just meets wifi spec when the old one didn&#039;t.</p><p>Now I believe revisions D1/D2/D3/D4 are all the same - at least I use the same firmware on D2 and D4, but the only other thing I can think of is a revision issue. Either way, N mode <strong>definitely works on a DIR-615 D2</strong> and you <strong>can get &gt;54mbps speed with working encryption</strong> using latest trunk builds.</p><p>Mind you I&#039;m having some trouble with the Ethernet on r24805, will either only connect at 10mbps or run 100mbps with lots of packet loss but only when connected directly to my desktop, via a switch it works fine - yet this didn&#039;t happen with older builds. </p><p><strong>For those of you who can or cannot get N working please post the following information:</strong><br />1) Router revision (i.e. D1, D2, D3 or D4)<br />2) Wireless mode (e.g. g+n, n-only, etc.)<br />3) HT mode<br />4) Security mode (on router)<br />5) Client device (e.g. Laptop with Intel 5100 card)<br />6) Security *and* encryption mode on client (e.g. WPA2-Personal, AES)<br />7) Highest reported rate on client</p><p>For me, the following *does* work:<br />1) Rev D2<br />2) g+n<br />3) 20Mhz<br />4) WPA2-PSK<br />5) Win7 Laptop w/ Intel 5100<br />6) WPA2-Personal, AES<br />7) 144mbps</p><p>I can get an actual data transfer rate of &gt;95mbps with these settings, limited mainly by the 100mbps Ethernet ports on the router.</p><p>[Edit/Update]</p><p>I&#039;ve got 40Mhz/300mbps mode working on Openwrt too. It works if I start up my router in the kitchen, but not my bedroom. There&#039;s less neighbouring APs detectable in the kitchen, so it must also be an interference-mitigation &quot;feature&quot;, not a bug. When there&#039;s lots of overlapping neighbours, it&#039;ll only run in 20Mhz/144mbps mode, if I start it up where there&#039;s few neighbours (or in a microwave) it&#039;ll run in 40Mhz/300mbps. It doesn&#039;t seem to switch between the two while operating - if it starts in 40Mhz and detects interference that would have caused it to start in 20Mhz, instead of switching from 40 to 20 the wireless seems to turn off completely...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 5 Jan 2011, 04:32)</p>

					<p>Interesting. Other than our build numbers, the only other difference I can see between my router and yours is mine&#039;s a D2 and yours is a D3. Perhaps the wireless chip revision is different between the two? How would I find out what the RF chip ID is on mine?</p><p>When I get a moment I&#039;ll compile r24915 and see how it works on my D2 and D4 revisions.</p>									</div>
