					<p>Things you can try:<br />Run &quot;pstree -p&quot; to see if you can find the process that&#039;s stuck.&nbsp; Get the process ID.&nbsp; Then run &quot;strace -p process-ID&quot; to see if it&#039;s doing anything.</p><p>Kill the build and run &quot;make V=99&quot; instead of just &quot;make&quot;.&nbsp; This will tell you what&#039;s happening.</p><p>Things that sometimes have that sort of effect:<br />1.)

					<p>I found a few more instances of the automake hang.&nbsp; Digging a bit further, I think what&#039;s going on is that I&#039;m building in an nfs-mounted area, and that it&#039;s trying to use file-locking primitives, which don&#039;t work over nfs.&nbsp; I remember hearing from some other gentoo hackers that autotools have got this bee in their bonnet about locking.&nbsp; I&#039;m starting over with a fresh checkout on the local disk, so far that seems to be working better.</p><p>Thanks...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, checked that those were running, but seems not to matter.</p><p>One of my buds, while explaining the screw case, tried to elucidate why what autotools is doing is different than a bunch of other stuff, but I&#039;m not sure I got all the nuances.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter, if using local disk instead of nfs constitutes a workaround, that&#039;s fine.</p>									</div>
