					<p>I have set up a surveillance system, consisting of a first generation &#039;TL-WR1043ND&#039; <br />router running Backfire, with USB-storage attached and three cheap wireless<br />IP-cameras from ebay. I wish to share this project with anyone interested.</p><p>The chosen cameras are from the manufacturer &#039;Wanscam&#039; and features motion<br />detection with FTP-uploading. </p><p>For setting up USB-storage refer to the documentation in OpenWRT&#039;s wiki.<br />In my setup, I have a 320GB USB-disk formatted with ext4, mounted at /mnt/storage</p><p>The recording functionality depends on a FTP-server and a handful of scripts.<br />I chose &#039;vsftpd&#039; available in the package repository.</p><p>First step is to create an user for the FTP-service. In my setup, this was done<br />like this: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>useradd -m -N -d /mnt/storage/cctv -s /bin/false cctv</code></pre></div><p>Next, set a password and configure the FTP-server. My configuration looks like<br />this (/etc/vsftpd.conf):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>listen=YES
background=YES
check_shell=NO
listen_address=192.168.0.1
dirmessage_enable=NO
session_support=NO
syslog_enable=NO
write_enable=YES
local_enable=YES
local_umask=0402
chroot_local_user=YES
userlist_enable=YES
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.users
userlist_deny=NO
anonymous_enable=NO
xferlog_enable=YES
xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd
xferlog_std_format=YES</code></pre></div><p>Note: the cameras chosen in my setup, required a chroot&#039;ed user setup to<br />function. Remember to add the FTP-user to the userlist_file: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo cctv &gt; /etc/vsftpd.users</code></pre></div><p>The logging from the FTP-server is used by the following two scripts, to<br />record a video stream when the cameras motion-detection is triggered.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# file:/bin/streamtrigger

This<br />script might need some changes to reflect a different configuration of the<br />cameras.</p><p>The system is started during bootup, from the following init-script:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
# file:/etc/rc.d/cctv

  killall -9 vsftpd
  sleep 5s
  rm ${LOG}
}</code></pre></div><p>Note: the init-script belonging to &#039;vsftpd&#039; is not used!</p><p>To ensure that the disk does not run out of space, I run the following<br />cleanup-script as a cron-job every night:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# file:/bin/cleanup

MOUNTPOINT=/mnt/storage
WORKDIR=${MOUNTPOINT}/cctv
LOWER=10485760 # 10 x 1024^2 = 10G

cd ${WORKDIR} &amp;&amp; for e in *; do
  AVAILABLE=$(df | grep ${MOUNTPOINT} | tr -s &#039; &#039; | cut -d\  -f4)
  [ -z &quot;${AVAILABLE}&quot; ] || [ ${AVAILABLE} -gt ${LOWER} ] &amp;&amp; break
  rm -r ${e}
done</code></pre></div><p>In case there is less than 10GB available, the script will remove the oldest<br />surveillance data to free up some space. This script assumes that the cameras<br />create a folder for each day, which is the case for the chosen cameras.</p><p>A note on storage capacity: In my setup, the cameras motion-detection is set on<br />highest sensitivity and they upload one image (VGA resolution) per second, when<br />triggered. The three cameras generate approximately 3GB data in total per day.</p><p>For browsing the surveillance archive, I have written a CGI-script in Lua,<br />which I&#039;ll post upon request.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rathka</strong> on 9 Feb 2014, 00:45)</p>

					<p>@dmcdonnell, in my setup I&#039;m using two Wanscam JW0011 outdoor cameras and one JW0004 indoor camera.<br />I wanted the three cameras to be from the same manufacturer, other than that I was aiming for the cheapest wireless IP cameras I could find on ebay. The setup should function with any IP camera featuring motion detection and FTP-upload.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello! After much work, since i am a newbee to linux, i have this &quot;homemade NVR&quot; running on my TP-Link TL-1043ND with one IP camera, and it works recording accelerated videos on motion detection. When I play these videos in slow motion, there are several frame losses at constant intervals, which leads to this accelerated playback at normal speed. Probably this happens because of low processor speed of my router, since there are other applications running on it and consuming resources. I put the startup script in init.d and enable to start with the system. But I have a doubt: in my active processes, there are two identical instances relating to this installation:</p><p> PID&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Owner&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Command&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CPU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MEM<br />1173&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {streamtrigger} /bin/sh /bin/streamtrigger&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2%<br />1176&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vsftpd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2%<br />1180&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tail -f /var/log/vsftpd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2%<br />1181&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {streamtrigger} /bin/sh /bin/streamtrigger&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2%</p><br /><p>Is normal two instances of streamtrigger running?

					<p>@pilovis cool project, with a bit more hardware modding than I am up to <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>@mbarriles I just upgraded my setup to barrier breaker and it is still running. Had to change the vsftpd config a little to allow writeable root.<br />The two streamtrigger processes looks right. One is the parent process running a tail- and second streamtrigger process. The second streamtrigger process evaluates the never ending while loop fed by the tail process.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply rathka. As the videos were getting bad, i decided to buy a raspberry pi 2 to run my NVR based on motion. My old TL-1043ND it was not enough to run my services. I got to run a NVR with a modified version of motion (ffmpeg enabled) in the tp-link, but it consumed all resources. Raspberry 2 already has enough power to run all my services, allowing leave the tp-link only for wi-fi due to its strong signal.</p>									</div>
