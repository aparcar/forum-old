					<p>Hi, </p><p>I have a PandoraBox Baidu BR100. </p><p>It has a micro sd card slot on it and when I connect a micro sd card it is mounted read only. </p><p>I am not sure if this is an openwrt problem or a linux problem because it also happens on my Ubuntu laptop with built in SD Card reader. I use an adapter in the PC. </p><p>I cannot for the life of me get it to mount RW. </p><p>There seems to be a lot of forum posts on the internet about this problem but not meany resolutions. Openwrt see&#039;s the card but and if there are contents I can access them but I cannot write to them. </p><p>this is the output of dmesg<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[  343.870000] mmc0: new SD card at address b368
