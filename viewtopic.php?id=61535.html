					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I am really new to OpenWRT, I have found it reading this article, about how to transform a mini router to enable wireless tethering to a PC: <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-tethered-shooting-with-any-DSLR-camera-V3/?ALLSTEPS">http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireles â€¦ /?ALLSTEPS</a></p><p>I have followed all the steps described in this article, and I managed to make it work connecting my laptop directly to the mini router, using its own wireless network (wifi photo in step 4), but I didn&#039;t managed to to join an existing network. The existing network is provided by another TP-Link router, WR941ND v2, and the mini router appears connected in the DHCP List section under Unknown name, with 192.168.100 IP assigned, but it doesn&#039;t appears under the IP List.</p><p>I have tried changing the htmode setting, just like the author of the article suggested, but without success.</p><p>Could you guys, please help me make this to work?</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Zolti</p>									</div>

					<p>So you copied a custom wirelessJN file to an USB drive and switched over to 3G and after some reboots ended up in WISP position? There might be some adjustments to /etc/config/network necessary. Please post the content of /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless. Further information on configurable options can be found in the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/faq.wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/faq.wireless</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I did that for the first time, and after that I&#039;ve been editing the wirelessJN file using vi /usr/bin/wirelessJN command in AP position on the mini router. The reboots are necessary so that the mini router would switch to the WISP module, but only after the button on the router are switched from the AP position to the WISP position.</p><p>The problem is, that I can only access those file in AP position, when &quot;wifi photo&quot; network is available, and not the desired bridge mode with the big router. I don&#039;t know what that wirelessJN file should do when it is active, but in AP position the files are configured for &quot;wifi photo&quot;. </p><p>I will post screenshots immediately with the content of wirelessJN, network and wireless.</p>									</div>
