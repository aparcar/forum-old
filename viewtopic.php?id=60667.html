					<p>Someone just gave me this <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/External-USB-Audio-sound-card-Adapter-Virtual-7-1ch-USB2-0-Mic-Speaker-Audio-Headset-Microphone/32394566078.html">External USB Audio sound card Adapter</a>. When I plugged it into the USB2 port on my Seagate GoFLEX Home, <em>dmesg</em> shows some error messages of <em>cannot get freq at ep XXXX</em> and I excerpted below. Does anyone here have any idea what those error messages mean? This also happens when I plugged the device into my Linux Desktop computer. However, it appears to work without a problem. I can only test this device when plugged into my Linux Desktop computer with Google HangOut+ to place and/or receive calls with no lost of audio in either direction.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[24571.453146] usb 1-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using orion-ehci

					<p>Ah okay, I don&#039;t know what those error messages mean either, I just remember that with the two packages you mentioned I got mpd to play my mp3&#039;s.<br />I haven&#039;t used the setup for a while though, so I cannot check for the error message myself.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>halfdome</strong> on 3 Nov 2015, 14:17)</p>

					<p>Hi mazi, sorry to write on a thread that has nothing to do with my question, but I need an advice about this thread:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22979">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22979</a></p><p>You are the only one that wrote to that thread and still alive in this forum.</p><p>I really like to run OpenWrt in the PS2 and I found nothing about except that thread, all the links are dead and I found no other<br />place that the user Kadett put these files, I found a cached thread on the old ps2-linux site ( that don&#039;t even exists right know).<br />Now I have 2 ps2 running a linux from Blackrhino, very slow and very heavy there is a kloader to do it.<br />I use to compile my own system and I made some packages to deal with some electronics devices that I made too, but I don&#039;t know how to add a new arquitecture to the build, not even a complex one like the cell processor.<br />I feel very sorry to no search for PS2 when I start to use OpenWrt, maybe I could get some of the config files posted in that thread.<br />Sorry again for write in this thread and sorry for my english is not my primary language.<br />Hope you can give me some advice about this.<br />Thanks.</p><p>Luis</p>									</div>
