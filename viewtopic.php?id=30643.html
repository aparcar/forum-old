					<p>I have been working on building a trunk build that has a IPv6 6RD on/off toggle.&nbsp; From the command-line I have a working system.&nbsp; However, I want to add a way to enable/disable this from LuCI.</p><p>Either through the Network-&gt;WAN setup page in LuCI, a simple checkbox to enable 6RD, which would be a 1 or a 0 option in a /etc/config/6rd file.&nbsp; Or, having a 6RD tab in LuCI app dedicated to this that would have a checkbox to enable/disable.</p><p>the ifup $wan and ifdown $wan are working from the commandline, and I have a script that enables 6RD when the wan comes up, and deletes the IPs from the LAN interface when the wan link goes down, but I have no easy way to set this from LuCI on or off....It would be great to have a web-based way to change this other than SSH...</p><p>Any tips/links/ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cconn</strong> on 28 Jun 2011, 01:11)</p>

					<p>right so I made a few mods to the ifaces.lua file and I have a working means of enabling/disabling 6RD on a tunnel interface designed for this purpose.</p><p>if has_6rd then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rdenabled = s:taboption(&quot;general&quot;, Flag, &quot;rdenabled&quot;, translate (&quot;Enable 6RD&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rdenabled.widget = &quot;checkbox&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rdenabled.default = rdenabled.disabled<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rdenabled.optional = true<br />end</p><p>in /usr/lib/lua/luci/model/cbi/admin_network/ifaces.lua</p><br /><p>my question is, is it possible to, in the case where a user were to enable this checkbox in LuCI, to uncheck another option under the WAN interface?&nbsp; &nbsp; Specifically, I want to disable:</p><p> ipv6 = s:taboption(&quot;ipv6&quot;, Flag, &quot;ipv6&quot;, translate(&quot;Enable IPv6 on PPP link&quot;)</p><p>if somebody clicks the rdenabled checkbox.</p><br /><p>As well, is it possible to disable an option that is not in /etc/config/network, specifically the dhcp6c enabled?</p><br /><p>And conversely, if somebody was to check the &quot;Enable IPv6 on PPP link&quot; option, I would want that to disable the rdenabled checkbox.</p><p>Any pointers would be great thx</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am also really interested in any instructions on how to add tabs, pages, and generally add to the LuCI configuration. If anybody has a link to the wiki I can read, or has any tips on where I can read any details, please do share them here.</p><p>I would like to make a package which depends on asterisk, and when installed adds an additional page to LuCI that allows to do some basic configuration of Asterisk to set up common stuff. How would somebody in my position go about getting that done?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any tips!<br />Iordan</p>									</div>
