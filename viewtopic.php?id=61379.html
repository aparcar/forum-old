					<p>Hi, I&#039;m trying to set up a cups server as documented <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cups.server">on the wiki</a> but the cups package doesn&#039;t seem to be around. e.g.:</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install cups<br />Unknown package &#039;cups&#039;.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package cups.</p><p>Should it be? I&#039;m running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 on a TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1, the image was installed from the relevant release package as an upgrade of AA. There seem to be a few posts on the forum from people configuring cups servers on CC so it looks like it&#039;s possible. What&#039;s going on?</p><p>- George</p>									</div>

					<p>I am also interested, how to do this. In general, everyone is excited with the open source projects, but in reality not so many people can benefit from them, because not everyone have enough skills to prepare packages for themselves. Even when they are free to download and compile...<br />Could anyone help us, stupid users? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
