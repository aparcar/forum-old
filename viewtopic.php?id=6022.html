					<p>it is possible to get openwrt on the v6 i suppose i have been gathering info on exactly what is necessary for some time(in order to do just that; my friend has a 54g v5)but as many others have said if at all possible get a different router it will be much easier and it will probably work better since 2mb flash and 8mb of ram isnt much for openwrt<br />it is possible to make it work but it will require some work and not for the faint of heart since the process requires a jtag and erasing the whole flash, because<br />the wrt54g(s) v5+ routers all run on vxworks a proprietary unix-like os and have a different bootloader(from what i understand)<br />in order to get it to work you would have to erase the flash write the replacement bootloader(cfe) then tftp(or flash) the new firmware but unfortunately no off the shelf openwrt image exists for this hardware because it isnt that appealing of hardware so you will need to make a custom firmware image and do some major pruning in order to make it fit under those tight flash and memory requirements if you do some digging around here there is some useful info but atm the only replacement fw for this particular router is dd-wrt which is okay but seems slower than the default fw(at least from my testing)<br />i have a 8M/512k cable connection and my testmy.net speedtest results are between 7.5 and 8.5M down and 498k up fairly consistently <br />after i flashed ddwrt it only is 6m but i didnt test it for that thoroughly so it isnt conclusive yet but i dont expect my results to change much</p><p>i am planning on putting openwrt or hyperwrt+thibor on his router to replace that joke linksys calls firmware cause it keeps crashing as soon as i finish i will post a howto either here (if its openwrt) or on linksys info</p>									</div>
