					<p>Hi all,<br />I need to add a custom package to OpenWRT.I have downloaded OpenWRT SDK but i don&#039;t understand how to edit the Makefile to let the make command compile my package.</p><p>First of all,the package i have to add is a custom version of olsrd..I&#039;ve downloaded the source files via git and modified what i needed.Then i ve red a guide that told me to put the &quot;olsrd&quot; dir into the package dir of OpenWRT-SDK and to create a new Makefile to build the package.<br />The problem is that my olsrd package comes with a premade Makefile,do I have to edit this Makefile or should I create a new one?Let me explain,i have:</p><p>- A Makefile in Desktop/OpenWRT-SDK/package<br />- A Makefile in Desktop/OpenWRT-SDK/package/olsrd</p><p>I guess that the first one has general info to build the different packages in the package dir,the second one has specific info for the package.Imo i should edit the first..but how?<br />I hope that u will understand what I wrote,I&#039;m sorry but english is not my main language <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>First of all,ty very much for helping me!I&#039;ve done what u told me and have started making the vmware image that i need via the make command in the main directory of OpenWRT.Unfortunately i encounter an error message when &quot;make&quot; starts to work on my package,it says:</p><p>make[3] -C package/olsrd compile<br />make -r world: build failed. Please re-run make with V=99 to see what&#039;s going on<br />make: *** [world] Error 1</p><p>So i&#039;ve tried to do:</p><p>vittorio@vittorio-laptop:~/Scrivania/SRC_WRT/8.09$ make package/olsrd<br />make: «package/olsrd» è aggiornato. ( &lt;-It means &quot;Is up-to-date&quot;)</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>Regards <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes it compiles and work.Btw I&#039;ve solved the problem with &quot;make&quot;(i guess it was only a name mismatch between my package and the name of the file targetted by the Makefile) and finally my OpenWRT image contains the olsrd package and it works ^^!</p><p>Ty very much to all of you that helped me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />!</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>
