					<p>All,</p><p>Whitest the Seagate Central is not a WiFi router, the platform already comes with a Linux distribution installed thereupon (from the factory). As such, I wonder how difficult it would be to instantiate openWRT up on this device. Granted, the device does not have Wi-Fi&nbsp; it does have a WAN and LAN port and is otherwise a router.</p><p> Is this device supported for openWRT? </p><p>Thank you in advance to those responding to my query.</p>									</div>
