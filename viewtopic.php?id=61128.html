					<p>I like to bridge an wifi network to an ethernet device (The goal is to bring a TV without wifi into the internet.<br />I am using an NEXX WT3020 with Chaos Calmer on it.<br />I thought I could establish the connectioin by briding the wifi and the lan interface. I am already connected to the wifi network but I could not connect to the internet.<br />I guess that there is a problem because the two interfaces use two different IP ranges. How can I bring them together?</p><br /><p><a href="http://abload.de/image.php?img=bridge2ujql.png"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://abload.de/img/bridge2ujql.png" alt="http://abload.de/img/bridge2ujql.png" /></span></a></p><br /><p>I just discovered that wifi is not connected, I did a scan and connected to the network with the correct passphrase. Signal is 77%<br /><a href="http://abload.de/image.php?img=wlan_fail8usy1.png"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://abload.de/img/wlan_fail8usy1.png" alt="http://abload.de/img/wlan_fail8usy1.png" /></span></a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>theincogtion</strong> on 25 Nov 2015, 01:53)</p>

					<p>Well for a wifi to ethernet bridge you will need the packages <strong>relayd</strong> and <strong>luci-proto-relay</strong> to get it to work.<br />With those both packages you can go on the luci interface Network -&gt; wifi and add a new Interface. On the protocol section there must be a item called relay - bridge ot something like that( sry im using Luci on german language).<br />Now you should be able to bridge your two interfaces you need. After that you have to allow those settings on your Firewall on network-&gt; Firewall -&gt; general settings. Allow Input/Output reject forwarded. And on zone lan allow everything. I used a german guide for this and can send you the URL from it so you can even see the settings on pictures.<br />It works for me and i hope it will also work for you</p><p><a href="http://blog.wenzlaff.de/?p=3718">http://blog.wenzlaff.de/?p=3718</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Taulin</strong> on 25 Nov 2015, 11:55)</p>

					<p>I dont think there&#039;s need in relayd provided that external network gives its own DHCP and DNS.</p><p>1) Disable router&#039;s own DHCP (or just disable dnsmasq)<br />2) Configure wifi interface in AP client mode<br />3) Create bridge between ETH and radio<br />4) Configure bridge interface as DHCP client or static address in the range of upstream network</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 26 Nov 2015, 11:22)</p>

					<p>That won&#039;t work without WDS because the wifi encapsulation only has three MAC addresses (we need four, source and destination plus the two wifi devices, this is precisely what WDS does).</p>									</div>
