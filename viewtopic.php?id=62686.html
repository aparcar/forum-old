					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have a 8GB SD card installed and have loaded the latest RPI2B .img on it successfully.</p><p>However, I noticed that I only have 33MB free so I presume that I need to extend the filesystem.</p><p>I found this but don&#039;t quite know how to use it. I put the code into a file on the root (ssh&#039;d in), made it executable and and then ran it but it just hangs, forcing me to control+c out of it.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rpi-openwrt/rpi-extendfs">https://github.com/rpi-openwrt/rpi-extendfs</a></p><p>Please can someone guide me in the right direction, keeping in mind that I am still in the learning phase <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Thanks!</p><p>EDIT: ls /dev/ | grep mmc results in these being found, my understanding is that this is two partitions on the SD card. </p><p>mmcblk0<br />mmcblk0p1<br />mmcblk0p2</p><p>I think that extending the root (p1?) will do the job for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mulletman87</strong> on 12 Feb 2016, 10:10)</p>
