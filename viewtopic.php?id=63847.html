					<p>hi all . <br />I&#039;m a newbie and try to install ffmpeg in my openwrt cc 15.0 _x86 version installed on a external usb drive and plug in a personal computer. <br />i have already installed ffmpeg ffserver and libraries from the repo but i cant stream live feed in mp3 or ogg <br />i just can in flv. I read a lot about cross compiling or similars but really don&#039;t understand nothing and i have fear to make a mistake. Could someone can help me? this openwrt station is already embedded with ddns and who wants can operate by remotely via ssh if need to see some configuration.<br />Thanks in advance <br />Any help and tips would be really appreciated</p>									</div>
