					<p>Hi ulmwind,</p><p>thanks for replying.<br />You mean that there is a main &#039;bug&#039; not allowing IPSEC (Strongswan) to work if firewall is enabled?</p><p>Basically the issue is that it works inbound but not outbound:</p><p>[LAN1]---[IPSEC Server]--------(WAN)------[OpenWRT]---[LAN2]</p><p>The IPSEC tunnel is established correctly<br />I&#039;m sitting on LAN2 and would like to reach LAN1</p><p>From LAN2 they can reach me, sniffing the traffic on (WAN) I can see that the traffic is ESP encapsulated. A PING goes through and gets a reply. Wonderful!</p><p>But if from LAN1 I try to PING something on LAN2, no ESP traffic is performed, but the PING is rather sent as pure routing, despite rules and tables (see some details in topic id=72226)</p><p>Hope you can help.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can stablish a IPSEC connection, then it does not look like a firewall issue, but a routing problem on the &quot;IPSEC Server&quot; machine. That machine must be configure to route all traffic destined to LAN2 through the IPSEC interface, but seems to be configured to use the WAN interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi eduperez,</p><p>no, not ecxactly</p><p>The traffic for LAN2 coming from LAN1 is traveling along the WAN link inside ESP packets. <br />Means that any traffic for LAN2 is &#039;directed into the IPSEC tunnel. <br />LAN1 knows how to reach LAN2 and it is done via IPSEC. </p><p>In the opposite way, LAN2 does not even try to put the data inside the IPSEC tunnel. <br />When something is sent from LAN2 to LAN1 it is not put inside ESP packets but it is sent in &#039;pure&#039; IP.</p><p>[LAN1]--&gt;[&quot;ESP data&quot; --&gt;&nbsp; IPSEC TUNNEL]--&gt;(WAN)--&gt;[IPSEC TUNNEL --&gt; &quot;ESP data&quot;]---&gt;[OpenWRT]---&gt;[LAN2]</p><p>[LAN1]--[IPSEC TUNNEL]--(WAN)--[IPSEC TUNNEL]---[OpenWRT]&lt;--[LAN2]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X &lt;----------------------------------+</p><p>The point is: why does OpenWRT not put the data for LAN1 destination into the tunnel, even if routing paths are correct, IPSEC result does know remote LAN subnets, table &#039;220&#039; is correctly shown...?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>seppax</strong> on 5 Oct 2017, 21:13)</p>

					<p>Ok, so I mixed LAN1 and LAN2. But if OpenWrt is sending packets for LAN1 on the open, then it looks like a routing problem on the OpenWrt device. Are you sure the routing tables are correct on that device?</p>									</div>
