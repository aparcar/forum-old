					<p>Seems that AC2600 is Qualcom-Atheros, while the AC3200 is Broadcom. The AC2600 is more likely to get support, but biggest factor in terms of timing will be whether it can be supported with ath10k or if a new driver is needed.</p><p>Looks like several manufacturers are announcing support at CES for the QCA9980 chipset, which is used in the AC2600. Hopefully they are in conjunction with an IPQ806x SoC (dual core Krait/ARM).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 24 Jul 2015, 04:34)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply! It must have been an oversight on my part that the C3200 is on Broadcom (Granted I was much more excited for the C2600, so really focused on that one). The C2600 looks quite nice in my opinion, styling and hardware. I have implemented a few of the older v2 archer C7&#039;s, and outside of the weaker range, they work great. The C2600 seems to be the successor to that with a more robust set of internals and more powerful antenna amplifiers, if so, this will be my next router. Of course, all dependent if OpenWRT will support it.</p><p>And yes, Krait CPU looks very promising as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cybrnook2002</strong> on 8 Jan 2015, 16:18)</p>

					<p>Anyone got their hands on a C2600 yet? The WRT1900AC v2 has great hardware but looks fugly. Being a QCA998x should mean it&#039;s supported by ath10k, right? This is definitely my next router if it gets OpenWrt support.</p>									</div>

					<p>Haven&#039;t seen it for sale anywhere, but it&#039;s at least listed on the TP-Link website (beyond a press release). It&#039;s been to the FCC according to wikidevi, so hopefully available soon. Agree that it could be a good one for OpenWrt, although ath10k isn&#039;t as open as ath9k, which has slowed development a bit.</p>									</div>

					<p>I recently brought the c2600 based on the SNB review of its MU-MIMO performance and the potential for OpenWRT support in the future. Currently using it as an AP but somewhat disappointed with its performance on stock firmware (in comparison to my old WZR-HP-AG300H on 15.05). Hoping development kicks off soon.</p>									</div>
