					<p>If it really is bricked and the tftp recovery method isn&#039;t working for you, you can try and recover via a serial cable, which worked for me as per;</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=243643#p243643">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 43#p243643</a></p><p>There may be some info earlier in the thread about tftp recovery, which is worth a go, but something I had limited success with. </p><p>Before you do all of that though, are you really sure you&#039;ve bricked the device. The lights suggest it&#039;s up and working, so perhaps you successfully flashed DDWRT and it&#039;s reverted to DDWRT defaults ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve recovered my TP-Link routers a couple of times with that method, and I have to power it off and on to get things going afterwards. After the file transfer is complete, I leave them alone for a few minutes to let them finish the flash, and then power it off. If you see a file transfer, it&#039;s not ruined, and should recover with serial if needed.</p><p>What firmware are you flashing to recover? If it&#039;s a TP-Link firmware, have you stripped the bootloader?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 16 Jan 2015, 19:58)</p>

					<p>alright thanks. i tried different firmwares, stock that was posted on dd-wrt to be used with the tftpd method and openwrt. I also did the dd method shave off the bootloader. But I let it sit there after it uploads and the WPS led turns off. So should i powercycle right after the LED turns off?</p><p>maybe my uboot also is thinking the wrong firmware for the device.<br />these will do? <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-To-RS232-PL2303HX-Converter-Module-Converter-Adapter-5V-3-3V-Output-YUUS-/151467356915?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item23442872f3">http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-To-RS232-PL … 23442872f3</a></p><p>if i cannot recover ill just rma, but order some of those adapters for the future.</p>									</div>

But if you let it sit for five minutes after the file transfer is complete, you can power cycle it. Nothing else is going to happen, anyway.</p><p>I recommend downloading an official firmware image from TP-Link and stripping it. Ideally, the same firmware version that was on it before you flashed any third-party firmware. Not strictly necessary, but it ensures that your bootloader matches your firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 16 Jan 2015, 21:03)</p>

					<p>Darn i just dropped it off. I want to try that. It should be added to the wiki, have you tried that on your c7 v2? Anyway I&#039;ll give it a shot if the RMA gets rejected and last resort rs232.</p>									</div>
