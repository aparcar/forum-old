					<p>Okay, ultimately I know I&#039;m the one that goofed, though it was a bit confusing trying to determine which file I was supposed to flash with, but anyway...</p><p>Using the wiki page about the wrt1200ac, I followed the trunk link to see the builds.&nbsp; Did a search and from what I understand, I was supposed to look at the Caiman builds.&nbsp; Only two files in that list matched up and one said &#039;factory&#039; so I figured I would need the other one.&nbsp; Tried it and now the router just flashes the power LED non stop.&nbsp; Best I can tell, I&#039;m going to need to use jtag to get things working again.</p><p>Problem is, I don&#039;t have a USB JTAG cable handy and ones I find via a google search are either expensive ($50 or more) or seem to be for a specific purpose (ie not sure if I can still use it or it would be a waste of money).<br />An example of what I mean: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/altera-Mini-Usb-Blaster-Cable-For-CPLD-FPGA-NIOS-JTAG-Altera-Programmer-new-/161597061343">http://www.ebay.com/itm/altera-Mini-Usb … 1597061343</a></p><p>So I&#039;m wondering, what are my options for getting it working?</p><p>(For the record, looking at the second link of files, I see I should have used one of the .img files from there, doh!)</p><p>If my only option is JTAG, is there a clear and simple guide on what to do?&nbsp; Seems like any guides written are for those who already know how to do it and thus don&#039;t need it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wolfie</strong> on 30 Jul 2015, 01:56)</p>
