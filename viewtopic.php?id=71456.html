					<p>I’d like to configure a OpenWRT router to use a public DNS (e.g. 8.8.8.8) to resolve the DDNS service installed on the router. But I want all clients who connect to be redirected to our DNS server which filters certain websites.</p><p>Our DNS server requires authentication using DDNS before it will respond to DNS queries. </p><p>Ideally I’d like to set this up using Luci.</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes DDNS is already installed and working using 8.8.8.8. But if I configure the router to use my DNS server it doesn&#039;t work as it&#039;s not authenticated and it won&#039;t authenticate until DDNS resolves....catch 22</p><p>I can configure DHCP for clients with my DNS server, but I want to make sure if a DNS server is manually configured on a client it gets redirected to use my DNS server.</p>									</div>

					<p>Configure your router to use 8.8.8.8.<br />Configure the DHCP server to advertise your DNS to your clients.<br />Block any forwarding from LAN to WAN on port 53; or even better, redirect all forwarding traffic for port 53 towards your DNS.</p>									</div>
