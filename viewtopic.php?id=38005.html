					<p>What you&#039;re looking for is called load balancing, but it isn&#039;t going to work like you&#039;re describing.&nbsp; Each of your local web servers will still have their own unique IP, and if you are pinging them from that particular LAN, or accessing those IPs directly, you will always connect to that exact system.</p><p>For load balancing to work, you need the load balancing device to be between the user and the destination machines.&nbsp; It will work its magic, and pass traffic to the target system transparently to the user.&nbsp; If you really want this to work on your local network, you would at minimum need to get up a second LAN on your router, or possibly even add a second router if yours doesn&#039;t support this capability.</p><p>I&#039;ve never set this up myself, but you can find some info to get you started here:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/multiwan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/multiwan</a></p>									</div>
