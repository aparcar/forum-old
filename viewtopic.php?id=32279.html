					<p>Hi. I&#039;ve been experimenting with getting OpenWRT running on my Linksys E3200 router. ...and, as one might expect, having issues.</p><p>First off, I have a CA42 cable hooked up to the serial port on this router, so while I&#039;ve managed to softbrick it several times, I&#039;ve never hardbricked.</p><p>whether I TFTP the .bin image I modified (took the TRX image, and the header from an official Linksys image, and made a .bin) or use the linksys web interface itself to program the router, the result is always the same.</p><p>so here&#039;s an example</p><p>I go into CFE and run upgrade code.bin, while I&#039;m attempting an upload with TFTP. (rexmt 1, timeout 60) ... Upgrades successfully.<br />THEN i reboot and it gives me <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Loading: .. 4092 bytes read
Entry at 0x80001000
Closing network.
Starting program at 0x80001000</code></pre></div><p>...Nothing follows.</p><p>now obviously, the .bin image I uploaded is definitely MORE than 4092 bytes. I&#039;ve also tried uploading the TRX file itself using &quot;flash -noheader&quot; with the same result.</p><p>Is there something so drastically different between this one and any other BCM47xx router?</p>									</div>

					<p>and of course, everything works fine when I switch it back to the Linksys firmware... if you define &quot;working fine&quot; as not being anything CLOSE to a fully functional Linux system.</p>									</div>

					<p>alright, I&#039;ll give it a shot. worst that can happen is i softbrick my router. ...unless i do something stupid like overwrite the bootloader (sidenote: I&#039;m not that much of a n00b)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi pandoraxero, </p><p>how did you succeed to soft unbrick your e3200 rooter? I&#039;ve bricked mine, while trying to install some self-compiled version (not the best idea ;-)) and now I&#039;m not able to unbirck it. Seems image lower than 3 MG is needed. I can not find such working and I&#039;m still trying to compile one for myself.</p><p>I will appreciate your hints.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, and by the way, there is some patches for &quot;Broadcom BCM53125&quot; that are working with dd-wrt. They are working, but DD_WRT is not my favourite.</p>									</div>
