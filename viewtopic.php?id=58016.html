					<p>Probably you have /etc/opkg.conf pointing to an version&#039;s download repo, and package downloads fail. </p><p>rc2 has enabled package list signature checks, and this makes old versions&#039; download repos to fail.

This is probably an oversight for rc2 or it was intentional as it is with trunk. Trunk is always luci free so that it can be tested without a luci bug throwing things off. In addition, if you can&#039;t install luci from the command line, you really shouldn&#039;t be using trunk. It&#039;s possible the developers felt the same way about this release candidate, although I tend to think it was an oversight more.</p>									</div>
