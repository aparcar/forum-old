					<p>Hello,<br />Today I finally got up the nerve to flash my Linksys wrt54gl router.&nbsp; After flashing I could ping and telnet in and set a password, and after than ssh in, so I guess I did not &#039;brick&#039; it.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, there was a problem on the way that is really bugging me.&nbsp; I have two machines, one is my main machine that I&#039;m conservative with.&nbsp; It&#039;s running Hardy Heron, the last Long Term Maintenance release of Ubuntu.&nbsp; The other machine is more for experimental stuff, and is currently running Karmic Koala, the most recent Ubuntu release.&nbsp; Both machines are 64 bit Intel, for what that&#039;s worth.</p><p>So, I downloaded kamikaze_8.09.1_source.tar.bz2 on the &#039;Hardy Heron&#039; machine and did a make.&nbsp; About the only thing I did was deselect wireless because I didn&#039;t need it.&nbsp; And, after grinding away for awhile, it produced the openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin file that I flashed onto the router and that&#039;s on it now.</p><p>But, since I was going to flash from my Koala machine, I ftp&#039;d the kamikaze tar file over there and tried to do a make there.&nbsp; First time around it said I needed this and that so I did some sudo apt-get install&#039;s until the make ran without error.&nbsp; The only thing is, there was no bin file afterwords.&nbsp; I used commands like &quot;find kamikaze_8.09.1 -name &quot;open-wrt*&quot; -print and nothing came up.</p><p>Again, I saw no errors in the make process.&nbsp; And I even copied the .config over from Heron to see if there was something wrong there.&nbsp; Still no dice.&nbsp; And I did another make back on Heron with the default .config and it created the binary.&nbsp; I googled to see if anybody else had any problems like this and came up empty.&nbsp; All I can say is, I&#039;m glad it worked on Heron or I&#039;d really be frustrated and scratching my head.</p><p>Anybody have an idea what&#039;s going on?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have got two Ubuntu Karmic (9.10) systems that will not build Openwrt 8.09.1 one is 32bit and the other is 64<br />All packages build OK, but only base packages installs, At that point everything mysteriously stops.<br />If I build it on Jaunty (9.04) everything completes correctly.</p><p>Before I spend hours tracking the problem down - has anyone resolved the issue?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stuffa</strong> on 14 Jan 2010, 16:42)</p>
