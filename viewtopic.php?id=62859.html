					<p>Hi</p><p>I just bought a Linksys WRT1200AC router and have successfully flashed both Chaos Calmer and Kaloz most recent build to it.<br />Both seem to work nicely. However, none of them have the &quot;Switch&quot; menu under &quot;Network&quot; in Luci. I can see the switch<br />via SSH with swconfig, but not via the web interface.</p><p>I run a DMZ and therefore need vlan support. Preferably, I&#039;d like to use Luci to do the configuration. Is it possible to enable the switch menu in Luci?<br />I have not been able to find out how. The switch menu is present with a fresh flash of Chaos Calmer on an old TP-Link WR1043ND v. 1.</p><p>Here is the output of swconfig:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@jumphost:~# swconfig list

					<p>It&#039;s a good start! Unfortunately it doesn&#039;t work in 15.05.1.</p><p>Simply seeing the switch option show up in Luci doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s working. I found that as soon as I tried to set interfaces to use the vlans via Luci, the interfaces became unusable. Be careful not to brick your router.

It may be related to this issue: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20739">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20739</a></p><p>So basically the advice above doesn&#039;t work and I&#039;ve yet to see a solution to getting vlan working on WRT1200AC.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rtsm</strong> on 17 Jul 2016, 13:19)</p>

					<p>I finally got VLANs working on WRT1200AC with OpenWRT 15.05.1 by following this advice <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=327851#p327851">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 51#p327851</a></p><p>As they found, you can easily brick your router if you don&#039;t set the interfaces exactly right, and it&#039;s not intuitive. You MUST set WAN port to use &quot;eth0.(vlan_number)&quot; eg: &quot;eth0.100&quot; and the other external ports to use &quot;eth1.(vlan_number)&quot; eg: &quot;eth1.2&quot;, even though WAN and LAN ports share the same switch and same VLAN config.</p><p>You must use the &quot;t&quot; tagged flag for the ports which the CPU connects to (5 on eth0 and 6 on eth1). So take careful note of the &quot;5t&quot; and &quot;6t&quot; in my example config below. Advice that is missing the essential &quot;t&quot; beside those entries did not work for me.</p><p>Also for some reason I found WAN had to use a specially set VID of 100 (or any number that isn&#039;t 1, and doesn&#039;t conflict with your other vlan numbers), while the VLAN itself must still be set to 1. See the example below.</p><p>Lastly, do NOT use Luci to configure the switch (eg: Network &gt; Switch in the Luci inteface). You must edit /etc/config/network by hand to change the switch and VLAN definition. Luci will make a mess of switch and VLAN config. It autodetects the VLANs incorrectly when defining interface physical connections. It will try to call them all &quot;eth0.1, eth0.2, eth0.3..&quot; and so on, when in fact you must use &quot;eth1.X&quot; for all LAN ports and &quot;eth0.X&quot; for the WAN port. Using Luci&#039;s Network &gt; Interface &gt; (Interface Name) &gt; Physical Settings config page is fine as long as you ignore the VLANs that Luci autodetects and type the correct ones using the &quot;Custom Interface&quot; box to define them the first time.</p><p>If I failed to do any one of these things, all the ports became unusable. I found that as long as I had SSH access set up to be accessible via the wifi connection, I was able to recover from mistakes easily enough.</p><p>BEWARE: The example should work for WRT1200AC v1 / WRT1900AC v2 / WRT1900ACS v1.</p><p>For WRT1900AC v1 entries for &quot;eth0&quot; and &quot;eth1&quot; need to be SWAPPED as you can see in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1x00ac_series#switch_layout">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wr … tch_layout</a></p><p>My working config, with WAN and each LAN port on its own VLAN (Ports labelled as 3 and 4 on the back of the device are defined here but currently unassigned to any network):</p><p>/etc/config/network:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch

					<p>Hopefully this will help others but on my WRT1200ac after following the above and manually adding the VLAN set-up in CLI it did not seem to come back up correctly after a reboot, as there was no internet connectivity/DNS even on the local LAN, I found that each ethernet and wireless inteface had to have a VLAN to get the configuration working. Which with exception of the WAN (eth0), I added a bridge to the interface if not already bridged and the interface(s) and VLAN in to the bridge.</p><p>For the WAN (eth0) I use a PPPoE-wan config to connect to my ISP. The interface does not offer a bridge option in LUCI and would not connect if I left it on eth0, as such to get this working and connecting to the ISP I had to move from eth0 to eth0.2 (my WAN is VLAN2) using the custom option in LUCI and typing it in manually. After this change it connected fine to the ISP.</p><p>Probably worth noting that the VLAN&#039;s were added via CLI (used &quot;nano&quot; text editor to edit /etc/config/network), then all interfaces changes in LUCI where I added the VLAN to the interface was done by using the custom option and typing in the interface using ethx.x (i.e. interface number.VLAN sub interface) notation. This is an issue with LUCI on the WRT as mentioned above. Then I rebooted the router to ensure that all the changes were picked up before testing, this is how I found my internet connection problem as it was working OK until I rebooted.</p><p>This has now been working for a day or so now without issue and I have a tagged VLAN truck on port 1 with 4 VLAN&#039;s running to a separate managed switch which also has full connectivity on all the VLANs.</p><p>Hope the additional info helps someone else...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paped</strong> on 9 Aug 2016, 14:27)</p>
