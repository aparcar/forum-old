					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I want to check out my network information sent out plain text.<br />I installed dsniff on a WR703N and on a Fon 2201 router, and when running all seems to be fine, but when i logon to a website, thus sending a plain text password, i get &quot;segmentation fault&quot;. I tried reading the logs but there is nothing usefull there, the program just stopped. <br />Do you know where to find a solution to this? i added extra storage to the 703(4gb) and the processor should be fast enough, i just keep getting this message! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems to be a bug in dsniff then, somebody needs to debug it with gdb or gdbserver or printf sprinkling.</p>									</div>
