					<p>Hello,</p><p>I can tell you that I use OpenWRT for quite some years even before purchasing my TP-Link&nbsp; 1043ND router I flashed it on the same day, so I can&#039;t give much feedback regarding the original setup.</p><p>What I can tell you is that OpenWRT works great in TP-1043 ND. I&#039;ve been using it for 3 years and in January I bought a new TP-1043ND V2 and works great. Both routers have the root FS in a USB pen so I have lots of space to add applications. I couldn&#039;t be happier.</p><p>I even have a VLAN setup in my house with both TP-Link routers.&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56016">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56016</a></p><p>The process of installing openwrt in these routers is pretty straight forward. Never had any problem and I&#039;ve been doing either initial flashing as well as release upgrades.</p><p>I&#039;d definitely recommend OpenWRT in TP-1043ND.</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>
