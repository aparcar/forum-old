					<p>Hello Everybody</p><p>What is the best supported Router for OpenWRT?<br />I like to use USB 2.0 with Webcam Drivers and Wifi.</p><p>Yet i have test the following Routers:</p><p>Asus 500gp V1:<br />- with Kernel 2.4 (brcm-2.4)<br />&nbsp; - USB 2.0 Webcam =&gt; doesn&#039;t work<br />&nbsp; - Wifi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; works</p><p>- with Kernel 2.6 (brcm47xx)<br />&nbsp; - USB 2.0 Webcam =&gt; works fine<br />&nbsp; - Wifi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; works but not stable </p><p>Asus 500gp V2:<br />- with Kernel 2.4 (brcm-2.4)<br />&nbsp; - USB 2.0 Webcam =&gt; doesn&#039;t work<br />&nbsp; - Wifi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; works</p><p>- with Kernel 2.6 (brcm47xx)<br />&nbsp; - USB 2.0 Webcam =&gt; doesn&#039;t work<br />&nbsp; - Wifi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; doesn&#039;t work</p><p>Linksys/Cisco wrt54gl:<br />- with Kernel 2.4 (brcm-2.4)<br />&nbsp; - USB 2.0 =&gt; doesn&#039;t have one<br />&nbsp; - Wifi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; works</p><p>- with Kernel 2.6&nbsp; (brcm47xx)<br />&nbsp; - USB 2.0 =&gt; doesn&#039;t have one<br />&nbsp; - Wifi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; works</p><p>The Best of my Tests is the Asus 500gp V1, <br />but the Router is no longer avialable! :-(</p><p>According to the following Webpage:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware.html</a></p><p>it seems that the Linksys/Cisco WRTSL54GS is the best for both the USB and the Wifi ??</p><p>But the problem is that it is not available here in Switzerland.</p><p>Which Router do you all use or which one is your favorite?</p><p>Thank you very much!!</p><p>Dusty</p>									</div>
