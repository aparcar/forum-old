					<p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and trying to figure out how to use the 6RD my provider uses. It worked on a Fritz!Box without any special configuration. The examples found in the manual and on this forum suggest that I must know some parameters. However my providers sends them through DHCPv4. After much trial and error I&#039;ve the following changes (* at beginning of line) in /etc/config/network</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth0.1&#039;
        option force_link &#039;1&#039;
        option type &#039;bridge&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
*       option ip6assign &#039;64&#039;
*       option ip6hint &#039;13&#039;

config interface &#039;wan&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;
        option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;
*       option iface6rd &#039;wan6&#039;

config interface &#039;wan6&#039;
        option ifname &#039;@wan&#039;
*       option proto &#039;6rd&#039;</code></pre></div><p>And in /etc/config/dhcp the follwoing:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;
        option interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option start &#039;100&#039;
        option limit &#039;150&#039;
        option leasetime &#039;12h&#039;
*       option dhcpv6 &#039;disabled&#039;
*       option ra &#039;server&#039;</code></pre></div><p>With that I get the correct IPv6 addresses -- as checked with the last part of the IPv4 -- and all machines on my network get an IPv6 address. The can ping6 each other as can the router. However none can reach the outside world. The output from ifconfig:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>6rd-wan6  Link encap:IPv6-in-IPv4

With the latest snapshots or manually built images (<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/</a>) your setup should work with the default configuration (you only need to install the 6rd package if you use the precompiled images and then reboot).</p>									</div>

					<p>With BB you should remove the section &quot;config interface wan6&quot;, but leave the option iface6rd in the wan section.<br />Furthermore I would set option dhcpv6 to server in /etc/config/dhcp but it shouldn&#039;t make much of a difference.</p><p>Setup looks correct otherwise, you could post the output of &quot;ifstatus wan6&quot; and maybe mention what your ISP is.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think that my provider is doing something special. It is still a test, but it has worked the last 3,5 years on a Fritz!Box model 7390 and 7490. I work for a computer magazine and have done a test with multiple routers -- with IPv6 support according to the manufacturers -- to see if they can get an IPv6 connection. None have failed. I didn&#039;t test the default TP-Link firmware on this router because I bought it for OpenWRT.</p><p>If there is anything I can test, let me know. I will think about a procedure to test it further. Most probably a back-up of the current state and the a factory flash to see if the <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/FAQ-482.html">default firmware</a> works. I&#039;ve the WDR4300. I will also test a clean OpenWRT flash and then directly the above configuration. I can&#039;t completly rule out that some experiments might have done something stupid.

					<p>I ran a tcpdump on the ping6 to Google. That gave a strange result. I see answers from 2001:838:ad45:5300::1 but the ping6 utility never sees them? Then I installed the ip utility because in the past that gave me better result with IPv6. The first thing was indeed the route:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@tplink:~# ip -6 route show

May be it helps...</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>CyrusFF wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I usually assume I would get a bug report if stuff like 6rd would break but who knows who is still using it today.</p></blockquote></div><p>A few years ago this was the trick for rapidly rolling out IPv6. At that time I saw a lot of providers testing it. Telfort is after 3,5 years still testing it I presume <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. It worked two years ago on five different routers which I tested at that time. Until the switch begin this week it worked on a Fritz!Box 7490. And as you see it looks like OpenWRT at least sees that it is present. May be one of the received options is wrong?</p>									</div>
