					<p>I apologize for asking such a possibly simple question, but I&#039;m beyond frustrated. </p><p>I have an Apple Airport Extreme running a 5.0 GHz 802.11n network for my AppleTV, Laptop, and iMac. Everything is hunky dory. What I&#039;d like to do is set up my old WRT54G as a 2.4GHz 802.11g access point that is bridged to my existing APE. </p><p>I can get the WRT to grab an IP from my APE, but I can&#039;t bridge. I want the APE to do all the DHCP as well. I realize that I can create an b/g compatible 802.11n network, but that puts the majority of my gear back in the 2.4GHz interference zone, which from time to time is heavy in my neighbourhood. </p><p>Any advice?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I thought it was a stupid question!</p><p>I got it to work after I realized I was deleting the &quot;bridge&quot; par under the LAN interface. Without it, the interface won&#039;t bridge with the WiFi, which is why I kept having to reset. Duh. Everything works the way it should. </p><p>Just make sure to point the Gateway and DNS to your apple router and you&#039;re set. </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
