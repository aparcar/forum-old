					<p>Hi, I need to upgrade router from stock to openwrt and because I&#039;m doing this remotely, I need to do it right to save a long trip. Router is connected to the network via lan port, so I just need to preset different ip (and disable dhcp, which I can do in package/network/services/dnsmasq/files/dhcp.conf). Default openwrt IP 192.168.1.1 would make IP conflict after fw update.</p><p>I found file ./package/base-files/files/bin/config_generate which looks promising, closely this section:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>        case &quot;$protocol&quot; in
                static)
                        local ipad
                        case &quot;$1&quot; in
                                lan) ipad=${ipaddr:-&quot;192.168.1.1&quot;} ;;
                                *) ipad=${ipaddr:-&quot;192.168.$((addr_offset++)).1&quot;} ;;
                        esac

                        netm=${netmask:-&quot;255.255.255.0&quot;}

                        uci -q batch &lt;&lt;-EOF
                                set network.$1.proto=&#039;static&#039;
                                set network.$1.ipaddr=&#039;$ipad&#039;
                                set network.$1.netmask=&#039;$netm&#039;
                                set network.$1.ip6assign=&#039;60&#039;
                        EOF
                ;;</code></pre></div><p>But I never did this before. Can I just replace 192.168.1.1 with something like 192.168.1.111 and opewnrt will boot with this IP by default (also after firstboot)? Or is there another &quot;documented&quot; way of doing this?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Another question: everytime I modify some file like this, do I have to make clean, or make will know it&#039;s newer and compile it again?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 10 Feb 2018, 18:01)</p>

					<p>That should be the right place for most routers. (a few exotic targets ship a network config differently).</p><p>But if you want the same address to be also in the failsafe mode (using &quot;preinit&quot; settings), you need to set that in the menuconfig:<br /><a href="https://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt/openwrt.git;a=blob;f=package/base-files/image-config.in;hb=HEAD#l76">https://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt/open … b=HEAD#l76</a><br />(or you could change that preinit ip in base-files Makefile, where there is a similar fallback default for that item)</p><p>But I think that the easiest thing would be to ship your own /etc/config/network as a custom file included in the firmware. You could tinker all options in it as you want and then just included it in the image. A new /etc/config/network is only generated if it is missing when the router boots for the first time. If there is your own file, it is used.<br /><a href="https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-developer/use-buildsystem#custom_files">https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-dev … stom_files</a><br />Similar approach works also with imagebuilder.</p>									</div>

					<p>Great, thank you. And do I have to make clean in case I made another change? Or make will notice changed files?</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to at least recompile base-files. </p><p>Make will not notice this kind of changes for most packages,&nbsp; but I think that basefiles is a bit special and always gets made in a normal firmware make. So changes to are likely picked up in any case.</p><p>But I do typically a make clean before compiling the final image for burning. It is always the safe approach.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 10 Feb 2018, 18:59)</p>

					<p>Ok, thank you. I used to make clean with old versions of openwrt frequently, but I don&#039;t recall I had problem with unclean build on recent ledes/openwrts so I don&#039;t make clean often for some time, because after it takes more than hour to compile on my build system :-(</p>									</div>

					<p>So I edited ./package/base-files/files/bin/config_generate and remote upgrade worked like a charm, thanks for help again. After make clean compilation took only about 25 minutes, so not the whole hour, it&#039;s good ;-)</p>									</div>
