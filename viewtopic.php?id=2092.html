					<p>noticed many differences in wlioctl.h of RC2 and of BRCM 4.0.0.7<br />Some that may need a closer look:<br />* WPA_AUTH and WPA_AUTH2 bitvectors (defined in BRCM, not in RC2)<br />* WL_SECPVT_DATA_LEN definition<br />* Radically changed datastructure in /* Event data type */ section of sta_info_t&nbsp; (three new items in the structure)<br />* additional flags WL_STA_WDS and WL_STA_LINKUP<br />* changed definition of WLC_E_LAST and addition of WLC_E_TXFAIL<br />* missing WL_CHAN_xxx settings (6 pieces)<br />* missing WL_WDS_WPA_ROLE_xxx (3 pcs.)<br />* many things were deleted that are in RC2</p><p>Would these thing need being adapted if the latest wl driver binaries are used ?</p>									</div>
