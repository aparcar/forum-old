					<p>Thank you for the answer.</p><p>So no support is envisaged in the future for the v3? <br />I just bought an MR-3020 specifically for the task of a print server which could be done by installing OpenWrt and afterwards the p910nd. Unfortunately I did not paid attention to the version number and if there is no support expected in the future I&#039;ll have to sell it.</p><p>By the way, I read somewhere that probably the original firmware is based on a fork of OpenWRT? Can anyone confirm that? <br />If that is so than would it be possible to have the p910nd installed on the original firmware?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

As much as I love the ones I already have, there&#039;s really no point in <em>buying</em> this router anymore. It has never been particularly powerful, even when it came out more than half a decade ago, and by today&#039;s standards it is only barely usable. For anything beyond basic OpenWrt router performance you&#039;ll (figuratively) have to bend over backwards, and even then it won&#039;t run great (i.e., forget about transmission). Do yourself a favor and pretty much for the same amount of money get something more capable, especially with more flash memory and more RAM, a better CPU and Wifi radio, and maybe a few more ports while you&#039;re at it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 27 Feb 2018, 19:12)</p>
