					<p>Hi there</p><p>Seems to me that doing a big WDS network with different SSIDs isn&#039;t working when trying to associate wireless clients to other APs than the one set to wl0_ssid set to the same as the wl0_wds_ssid. When trying to connect a new client to any other AP I can see the station ID when doing wl assoclist, but the client never gets an IP address.</p><p>I&#039;ve set all APs to the same SSID by using wl0_wds_ssid, but the different APs have their own unique SSID set with wl0_ssid.</p><p>All APs are using 0.9. Wds network with WPA encryption.</p><p>What could be causing this?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mflage</strong> on 24 Jul 2007, 17:40)</p>
