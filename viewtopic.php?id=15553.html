					<p>Hi, I&#039;m constructing myself a MP3-WLAN-Radio based on a Asus WL500GP. Everything works well, however I&#039;d like to connect a USB keyboard or keypad to my device to control it without my notebook.</p><p>Parsing /dev/input/eventX looks painful, so I stumbled upon the program &quot;cmdpad&quot; which should&nbsp; be in the trunk SVN. However I cannot find it, has it been removed? Is there a besser solution for the thing I am trying to do? I want to launch commands when a certain key is pressed, but a program that just prints the name of the pressed key to stdout would be nice - the rest could be done with a nice shell script then :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tommie</strong> on 4 May 2008, 18:52)</p>
