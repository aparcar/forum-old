					<p>My apologies for the newbie question - I&#039;m just starting to learn about networking things, so I&#039;m not 100% clear on how things work.</p><p>I&#039;ve set up my WRT54GL with White Russian 0.9.<br />I&#039;ve got the WAN directed to the WLAN, in routed mode.</p><p>For some odd reason, the wireless spot I connect to gives IP lease times of 10 minutes: whenever the lease is renewed, any connections are broken.</p><p>Is this normal? I could be imagining things, but I don&#039;t remember having this problem when I connected directly to the wireless network and not through the router.&nbsp; Is this a known issue?</p><p>What can I do about this?</p><p>Many thanks for your replies.</p>									</div>
