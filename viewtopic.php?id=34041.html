					<p>AR9331 is quite new. But I guess there will be a lot of new devices. e.g. TP-link is using it for their &quot;travel-routers&quot; like the wr703 and this soc is used in newer revisions of some of their normal routers&nbsp; e.g. wr741nd wr740n. <br />I have a bunch of this devices running and they are working quite well, and they are quite cheap (15-20euro). But maybe a take a look into the RT3050, and try one of these.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot guys, looks really like what i was looking for!</p><p>Any of you has one their &quot;plug&quot; form-factor device? No heat dissipation issue?<br />How is the wireless driver behaving when in client mode? We don&#039;t need AP mode for our usage.<br />Does tp-link show some respect for the GPL?

					<p>hi, </p><p>tp-link seems to release all sources that are under the gpl. (take a look on their homepage under support - gpl</p><p>and I don&#039;t own a plug-device, but I own a wr703n (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32888">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32888</a>) and it really small and I have no thermal problems at all, actually the case get only a little warm. </p><p>ap- and station-mode works with out any problem, I didn&#039;t try WDS, repeater or multi-ssid but it should be possible as well. </p><p>But be aware that you need at least 4MB Flash and 16MB RAM to run openwrt on it. some have only 2MB Flash</p>									</div>

					<p>Ralink RT3050/3052 is probably the cheapest SoC with wireless support. The USB blows chunks, but the wireless works pretty well and the processor is decently quick.</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you know of any product built in a &quot;plug&quot; form factor with an RT3050? I can only find regular routers or 3G gateways power on batteries. <br />We don&#039;t need USB, so this SOC is definitely a good candidate.</p>									</div>
