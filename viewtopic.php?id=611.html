					<p>From the <a href="http://www.hping.org/">web site</a>:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn&#039;t only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features.</p></blockquote></div><p>The package can be found in my <a href="http://nthill.free.fr/openwrt/ipkg/testing/">testing repository</a> (and its <a href="http://nthill.free.fr/openwrt/src/ipkg/hping2/">sources</a> are available too). It was built with libpcap, since the low-level packet framework doesn&#039;t seem to work with vlan interfaces (exits with &quot;[main] physical layer header size unknown&quot;, patch welcome).</p><br /><p>Happy testing</p><p>-- <br />Nico</p>									</div>
