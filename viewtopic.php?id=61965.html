					<p>You need the relayd package it will do the bridging for you. Maybe the following site gonna help you it shows how to bridge wireless lan to ethernet but should be the same or quite similar<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Taulin</strong> on 5 Jan 2016, 09:06)</p>
