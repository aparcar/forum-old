					<p>Hi..</p><p>I&#039;m considering trying to use vlans on my home network, to seperate things out a little.. But I&#039;m a bit uncertain how to do the following correctly:</p><p>I want 4 different networks :<br />* adults (This has to have full internet)<br />* kids<br />* media (this is for mediaplayers)<br />* servers (and printers)</p><p>some of them will have wifi connected as well (mainly main, kids and maybe media)</p><p>Adults, and partly servers, should have full internet connectivity<br />Media and Kids should only be allowed internet based on their mac addresses (a list of specific mac addresses on each network, which have internet connection).</p><p>I have already solved the last issue, with the kids network, so that only the devices that I allow, is granted internet access..</p><p>The problem lies in the fact that I want all of the networks to be able to communicate internally. This is so that f.ex. an android device on kids network, can control xbmc on the media network.</p><p>I was thinking of dividing a ip-range into smaller bits, like :<br />Servers : 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.15<br />Adults : 192.168.0.16 - 192.168.0.31<br />kids : 192.168.0.32 - 192.168.0.47<br />media players : 192.168.0.48 - 192.168.0.63</p><p>Router / dns / dhcp is located at 192.168.0.1</p><p>is this the way to go forward?</p><p>Can I seperate internet access to the different subnets, while keeping the internal communication?</p><p>/ Thomas</p>									</div>
