					<p>silvakair,&nbsp; stop starting new threads.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;re spamming your question all over the place.&nbsp; Have a little consideration for the freakin&#039; forum you&#039;re trying&nbsp; to get to fix your problem&nbsp; and for the internet at large.</p><p>Also, you want to run a DNS &quot;server&quot;, not resolver. </p><p>And now i will be a jerk: If you didn&#039;t understand the instructions that you pasted into your original post, which are QUITE specific, you don&#039;t likely have any business running a DNS server to begin with because once you actually get the thing started up it only gets harder from there. </p><p>Of course, you could learn by doing some reading, but from what you&#039;ve shown over the past 2 days here you probably won&#039;t, so why bother getting this running to begin with?</p>									</div>
