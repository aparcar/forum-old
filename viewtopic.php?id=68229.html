					<p>What issues are you seeing with the driver? I see the source and I am guessing this is a Marvell issue if there are some but I might be able to help. I have some dev knowledge coming from a FreeBSD background in making nic drivers. I should be getting a 3200ACM soon as I was one of the winners so I want to make sure I pay it back to the community.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>So I&#039;m the newb that&#039;s been posting results on the github. Guess I should have posted here -- still new about how all that.... dev stuff works.</p><p>But I flashed the image posted there, I don&#039;t see much of a leak. Couldn&#039;t test heavy traffic using the internet though, because I have FTTH and my ISP uses PPPoE. The PPPoE module wasn&#039;t in the image so I couldn&#039;t connect.</p>									</div>

					<p>@farchord, Okay that explains the issue. I don&#039;t need that in my environs, so it is not in the OOTB image. The packages are built, but you will have to install. Documented in many places on how to get things, including the thread for the build from whence you came. Or you can wait for things to catch up, I assume the patch I used to get to 4.9.27 today will find it&#039;s way into master soon enough.</p>									</div>

					<p>This morning I tried to install the ppp-mod-pppoe ipk. I downloaded the whole package repository to a local webserver (just in case). But it fails to install because of the missing pppoe kernel module which ain&#039;t in the repo.</p><p>So unfortunately I can&#039;t really test this further.</p>									</div>
