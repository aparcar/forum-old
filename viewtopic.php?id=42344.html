					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I have setup the connection to a VPN at work using the following steps on&nbsp; my Open WRT enabled router.</p><p>Fresh install of OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1 / LuCI 0.11 on my TP-Link 1043ND.</p><p>(This is all in Luci)</p><p>Set my log in password</p><p>Set the router to get it&#039;s LAN interface IP from the DHCP on my local network.</p><p>Then Installed &#039;ppp-mod-pptp&#039;</p><p>Then created a new interface which I called &#039;VPN&#039;, I am quite imaginative you see :-)<br />Then set the VPN sever, user name and password.</p><p>Assign the VPN to LAN Firewall section. (Not sure if that is right, but I thought it can&#039;t hurt?)</p><p>Then Reboot the router.</p><p>When the router comes back the new connection is shown in green and packets are being sent and received, not many but probably just keep alive ones.</p><p>Any way I&#039;m now lost as to how to get a PC plugged into the router to use the VPN rather than what I guess is the default route for network access.</p><p>(I thought that now all the devices would be connected to the VPN at work).<br />I setup a static route, I tried using the default gateway and the VPN gateway but nothing changed when I go to WhatIsMyIsIP.com for example.</p><p>Is there something I&#039;m missing please?<br />Any help or advise is much appreciated.</p>									</div>
