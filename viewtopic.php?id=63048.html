					<p>I am attempting to start and stop an openvpn tunnel using a button event. BTN_8 pressed will start the the connection and released is supposed to stop the connection. </p><p>As long as the openvpn connection is commented out, the events occur as they should. In the log, they are documented. When I uncomment the openvpn connection it will start the connection, but then turning the switch off does not disconnect. I have done some troubleshooting by placing various commands in the if then statement. In the log, there are no longer any button events when the connection is active if it is started from within the script. If I &quot;killall openvpn&quot; at the command line, the events are received again. </p><p>Based on my troubleshooting, it appears to me that by starting the process within the event script that it holds any further button events until the process is stopped. In other words, when the pressed event occurs and starts the connection, even if I turn the switch off and on several times no further events occur (no even registering in the log) until I manually kill the process at the command line. What am I doing wrong?</p><br /><p>\#!/bin/sh</p><p>logger &quot;Button: $BUTTON ; State: ${ACTION}&quot;;</p><p>if [ &quot;${ACTION}&quot; == &quot;pressed&quot; ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; openvpn --cd /etc/openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/home.ovpn</p><p>elif [ &quot;${ACTION}&quot; == &quot;released&quot; ];then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stopvpn<br />fi</p>									</div>

					<p>You might try starting openvpn as a detached process with &amp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; openvpn --cd /etc/openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/home.ovpn &amp;</p><p>Example:<br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=blob;f=package/network/utils/iproute2/files/15-teql;hb=HEAD">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a … ql;hb=HEAD</a></p><p>More complex example with several commands inside &quot;( ... ) &amp;&quot;<br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=blob;f=package/network/ipv6/6in4/files/6in4.sh;hb=HEAD#l12">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a … b=HEAD#l12</a></p><br /><p>Or, as openvpn has a startup script, you could use that for startup (assuming that it has normal config):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;/etc/init.d/openvpn restart</p>									</div>
