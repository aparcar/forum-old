					<p>Is it possible to use OpenWRT as a syslog server that other devices on the network (other routers and switches for example) log to? I have an old router running up-to-date OpenWRT with USB flash drive support, and I&#039;d like to repurpose it as a syslog server and have the logs that it captures saved to a USB flash drive</p><p>From my research, it appears that there used to be a syslogd package that has since been removed.</p>									</div>
