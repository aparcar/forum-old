					<p>wondered if anyone had any suggestions on this.</p><p>working on the web interface, and have come across a problem with forms that i can&#039;t solve.&nbsp; i have a form that, when i hit submit, hangs the browser/webserver.&nbsp; running ps shows that pushing submit caused a new &quot;httpd&quot; process to spawn, if i kill that process the form will go through.</p><p>oddly, if i reduce the number of input elements in the form to six or less it works fine, and this is true regardless of which input elements i eliminate.</p><p>i don&#039;t think it has anything to do with the script being called because (a) it never gets to it and (b) i tried it using a script that would do nothing more than echo the word &quot;done&quot; and still no luck.</p><p>here&#039;s the form causing the trouble.&nbsp; i&#039;m totally stumped on this and would appreciate any help.</p>									</div>
