					<p>I have the same router, and I am also interested on openwrt. Actually I am developing a fw for the wag354g starting from the official sources.<br />If you wanna some info about wag354, ask me! . Also I think jtag is possible using the sw ciclamab, so unbricking could be possible.</p><p>good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks kurtlemalin for that VERY useful link! I will try to integrate optware in the firmware...</p><p>By the way you do not need montavista preview kit to build the wag354g, take a look at my website and check the howto guide : <a href="http://cyberstorm.altervista.org/labels/wag354g.html">http://cyberstorm.altervista.org/labels/wag354g.html</a></p><p>About jtag, sorry to have mislead you, I have not built nor tested it yet. <br />I have just the photos taken from Hughe site: <a href="http://www.hughe.co.uk/pub/pics/tech/openwrt/">http://www.hughe.co.uk/pub/pics/tech/openwrt/</a> that show where the connector should be soldered.<br />I think that,&nbsp; as the wag354g has got a mips32 processor, it uses the standard ejtag pinout. But before doing some experiments, I need to buy a thin soldering iron <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <br />If you have some soldering/electronic skills, are you able to do some tests?</p><p>if you wanna do some testing on firmware,&nbsp; send me an email using the address on my site...</p><p>thank you</p><p>marco</p>									</div>

					<p>Does WDS work though, for anybody actually using the AR7 port on a device like this?</p><p>I am using the AR7 port on a different router (D-Link DSL-G604t) and I abandoned hope of getting the wireless to work. From the table of hardware, it looks like your router may have the same problem of needing the acx1xx driver to work...</p><p>When I last tested it, WPA/WPA2 was a total loss and regular WEP was too unstable to bother with.&nbsp; I ended up getting a plain old Linksys router to act as an access point on my LAN while using the AR7 for my ADSL gateway.</p>									</div>
