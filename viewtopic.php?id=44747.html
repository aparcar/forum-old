					<p>I am having trouble finding a solution to this (or understanding this since I am kind of a novice). Want I want to do is turn on my printer when I want to print something and then after a certain amount of time (or after its done printing), power it off. That way I won&#039;t waste standby power in between prints (I don&#039;t print that often). </p><p>My setup is a TP-Link TL-MR3020 wireless router using the p910nd print server which I currently can print wirelessly with no problems. </p><p>After some testing, what I think I need to do is the following;</p><p>1. Send a document to the printer.<br />2. Some type of program/script starts to run when it receives traffic on port 9100 (printer port).<br />3. GPIO pin 7 goes high (flips a relay that switches the AC power on for the printer).<br />4. GPIO pin 8 toggles (this resets the USB interface).<br />5. Document is printed.<br />6. GPIO pin 7 goes low after 30 min (not sure if there is a way to know when the printer is done printing and just shut it off then).</p><p>Is this even possible? Is there a better way to do this?</p><p>Thank you for the help in advanced.</p>									</div>

					<p>So another question would be, Can I write a custom version of p910nd to control GPIO ports? If so, how do I build and install it onto my router?</p>									</div>

Unfortunately I only have one USB port available and that is used for the printer. I have successfully controlled GPIOs via the terminal already by doing the following;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># turn off USB power
echo 0 &gt; /sys/devices/virtual/gpio/gpio8/value
# turn on USB power
echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/virtual/gpio/gpio8/value</code></pre></div><p>That was done for step 4 since after turning on the power to my printer (or plugging it in) for some reason the usb port has to be reset. I will be using this method to switch another (unused) GPIO with this, <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/119">www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/119</a><br />I just need to make sure the GPIO can power it, but I am not quite there yet.</p><p><strong>MBS</strong> &lt;-- I agree that should be done first. </p><p>I was able to use a tcpdump to listen to the port and verify that I only get traffic when I send something to print. So, I came across libpcap and will see if I can use this to make my own program to do what I want. If anyone has any knowledge with libpcap, any input would be helpful.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
