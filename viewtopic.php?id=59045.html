					<p>First of all hi and sorry.<br />I know that there are lots of topics that explain how to do this but i just can&#039;t do it.<br />I have a&nbsp; TP-LINK TL-WR740N V.4.26, during the night there was a storm and the WAN port now doesn&#039;t work. I read on the internet that i can change a LAN port to work as a Wan port so i decided to try it. I installed OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09&nbsp; and it works perfectly.<br />I tried following a guide that had me change some configs in the Switch tab and then in the Interfaces tab but it didn&#039;t work and I had to reset my router since i couldn&#039;t access the config page.<br />I also saw some posts saying to modify the /etc/config/network file , but i don&#039;t know where it is. How do i access it? I didn&#039;t find anything on google that tells me how.<br />I would really appreciate your help. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>vi /etc/config/network</p><p>anw seems you have modified the default switch settings<br />so look for a switch tab inside luci&gt;network<br />there you should see vlan<br />there should be 2 of them .. i see you have only one</p><p>for you to change wan port you need to have 2 vlans and inside luci&gt;network&gt;wan&gt;phisical settings you have to chose<br />which vlan is wan</p><p>from your wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr740n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr740n</a><br />seems your swich is not displayed corectly inside luci<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>LUCI Web Interface Have bug with port ID in switch section (Checked on v4.20) , LAN Port number on router=Port number in LUCI switch 1=2, 2=1, 3=2, 4=1</p></blockquote></div><p>so the easy way would be to go safemode and do safeboot or reflash and change wan port inside switch tab<br />the wan port is the vlan where most of the ports are off the lan vlan would be the one where most of ports are untagged</p><p>so you chose a port which you want as wan and swith it to off inside lan vlan and to untagged inside wan vlan<br />and switch to off the default broke wan so that you wont have to modify phisical settings inside luci&gt;network&gt;wan</p><p>edit: dont change port 0(cpu port)<br />make shure failsafe works or you have ttl adapter before changing network settings</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 15 Aug 2015, 16:06)</p>

					<p>Alright, i did what you told me and now internet is working again. Problem is it won&#039;t let me access router config page and the wifi led is off. I can&#039;t access the wifi from my phone, is that normal or do i have to change something in the configs?<br />Edit: I restarted my router and now internet isn&#039;t working again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alexcom</strong> on 15 Aug 2015, 16:39)</p>
