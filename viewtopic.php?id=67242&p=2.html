However with the apu2c4 i could easily use Debian which i&#039;d like even more. If there is a good and very flexible solution i&#039;ll take it. OpenWRT or not. And i am much more into Debian than openWRT since i use Debian for 2 yrs now and have never seen openWRT. The main reason to go here was that i thought, that here would be a lot of know how here which there is. Plus openWRT seemed the most flexible solution to do stuff. I might like to do &quot;more&quot; than just routing in the future. With the apu2c4 i&#039;d probably switch my SSH-Server, VPN Server etc to my router. This would enable me to get some services of my microserver and turn it off from time to time. Also i dont mind the more complicated configuring. Its all about learning. I am more into a solid solution which needs some work than a quickfix which might go on my nerves in a few yrs.<br />The 5GHz problem might not be one. I cant use the 5GHz band here anyways because for two reasons. One is the concrete walls. A 5GHz signal wont do anything there. And the other is a radar that is in the vicinity and i&#039;d have to dial into the exact frequency that the radar never uses. May i&#039;ll get an access point to boost the wifi signal and just for the heck of it i&#039;ll get the apu2c4 to mess around with stuff.</p>									</div>
