					<p>Hello community,<br />I&#039;ve became present from China. Its fully new revision of ZBT 826WE(4G) router. Box seems better (there are pictograms for each LED and slot).</p><p>I&#039;ve flashed my version of OpenWRT inside and immediately after it, Power LED stops shining. It is OFF. Router is WOrking.</p><p>My version of this router is 32MB FLASH, so I have changes in my DTS file. Previous version of this router works good (the same 32MB FLASH version)</p><p>Does anyone know, what could be wrong?</p>									</div>
