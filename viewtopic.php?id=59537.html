					<p>Hey,<br />I was wondering if anyone knew how to go about masking the MAC addresses of the clients on my wifi. Meaning that all outgoing network traffic appeared to be coming from one MAC address.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>MAC addresses are Layer 2 network addresses only. If you were to sniff traffic on your WAN port you would see everything coming from the router&#039;s MAC address and not the individual client addresses. There is nothing special you need to do, that&#039;s just how networking works.</p>									</div>
