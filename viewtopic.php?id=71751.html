					<p>Hello everyone, it turns out that I made a flash of a Tp-Link 841N V8. I thought I could download the original firmware or ddwrt or openwrt and flash memory with an SPI programmer, the issue is that I was investigating and those firmware only bring a part of the memory, the bootloader is missing and other things, or Whether I overwrite everything in flash memory and erase the bootloader eg the entire router is disabled, someone has the complete firmware, or made a back up of the memory to be able to flash it with the SPI programmer. I will be grateful to anyone who can help me. I red that can compile the complete firmware but the truth is that I do not understand much of that</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pindonga123</strong> on 9 Aug 2017, 22:37)</p>
