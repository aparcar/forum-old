					<p>ok I know its been about a month since I last posted but the case should be about 4.25&quot; by 6.5&quot; internal meaning the router should be small like a bifferboard<br />I&#039;m currently trying to find a screen that might work, I need some thing with a total size of 3.75&quot; tall and about 5&quot; long using usb protocol <br />the controls will be a Sega genesis three button controller boards and one or two psp thumb sticks wired to an AVR MCU that in turn is wired to the serial port of the router<br />the power is a 3.6v LI-Po battery and a 3.3v ldr with built in charge circuit <br />aside from all of that the main board is probably going to be a dual usb bifferboard<br />the sound is a pair of speakers from an ACER A1 connected to a stereo resistor dac<br />for storage the bifferboard has an mmc card slot gpios(I need a pinout of this)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pacman101</strong> on 24 Jun 2012, 23:56)</p>
