					<p>Hi! A few months ago i bought a WRT54GL and I installed openwrt on the device. I didn&#039;t need the wireless at all but I needed some strange configuration of the wired interfaces and thats why I chose this device and this highly configurable operating system. But since I am supporter of the free opened wireless AP, I configured the wireless interface on my device in such a way that everybody can connect to it staying outside my private network. Because of the blinking led I know that people connect there from time to time.</p><p>Now however I need to use the wireless and I need it to be encripted and bridged with the private network. In the same time I&#039;d like not to stop my &quot;free service&quot; to the random passengers. So my question is is this possible at all?</p>									</div>

					<p>It is possible, but I&#039;m not sure if it can be done with WhiteRussian (not saying it can&#039;t, just that I&#039;m not sure).&nbsp; With Kamikaze I believe that&#039;s a green light.</p>									</div>
