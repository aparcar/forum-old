					<p>What reasonably priced router that ships in Europe or specifically in UK should I consider that matches the three requirements:<br />1. must run latest openwrt <br />2. 802.1q with VIDs between 0 - 4095 and a <br />3. gigabit switch with at least two gigabit ports and a further 2 x 100 MBps ports (can be 4 x&nbsp; gigabit of course)</p><p>The usage of this router is going to be to have a VLAN trunk arrive on WAN port with one untagged and three tagged VLANs, and the switch ports should be untagged one per VLAn port1 = untagged vid 128 , port 2 untagged vid 144, port 3 unatgged vid 160 and finally port 4 untagged vid 168. Furthermore the router should give me 4 separate SSIDs that are bridged to the VLANs on the ports 1 - 4 . So I can also connect to each of the 4 VLANs over WL. </p><p>I have now looked at dd-wrt on my old linksys wrt54gl and found VID to be limited to 0 - &lt;= 15. </p><p>I then tried 3 different Buffalo ones flashed to Openwrt Attitude Adjustment on a WZR-HP-G300NH2, on a WZR-HP-GN and on a WZR-AG300H and found that whilst the /etc/config/network file and even LUCI seemed to support VLANs with ID higher than 15 (in my case 128, 144, 160 + 168) the physical eth0 interface as in eth0.144 or eth0.160 etc are not being created and I cannot use 802.1q on those. So, unless I missed something and the missing eth0.144 and eth0.160 etc interfaces can easily be created on the command line or in a bot up script and the whola thing then suddenly works I may need to buy a WL router that supports both gigabit switch port and full VLAN 802.1q funtctionality.</p>									</div>
