					<p>I have made negligible progress trying to get OpenWrt to work in a VirtualBox VM.&nbsp; I intend to persevere, but before I resume my efforts I thought that it would be worth asking whether what I am trying to achieve is theoretically possible with OpenWrt.&nbsp; I have been working on simpler configurations while learning how to configure OpenWrt, but ultimately what I want is a configuration that dd-wrt calls &quot;repeater bridge&quot;:&nbsp; I have a WAP that connects to the Internet; I want to configure OpenWrt to connect by Wifi with that WAP and to permit devices to connect to it using either wire or Wifi.&nbsp; All connections to the OpenWrt repeater should be on a subnet.</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Image:Repeater_Bridge.jpg">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Im â€¦ Bridge.jpg</a></p><p>The Broadcom WDS configuration (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/broadcomwds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/broadcomwds</a>) seems to be what I am trying to describe.&nbsp; However, my MB has a Wifi NIC that uses the Atheros AR9285.&nbsp; Also, I have been staying away from WDS because I have read that there might be compatibility problems with the WAP that connects to the Internet.</p><p>I saw the statement &quot;mac80211 STA mode supported on trunk. STA and AP at the same time is not yet supported(r22989)&quot; under &quot;Wifi Networks&quot; on this page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a>.&nbsp; I think that my NIC does not use this driver, but I found the statement disconcerting.&nbsp; I think that &quot;STA and AP at the same time&quot; is what I am trying to do, so I wonder whether the driver used by my NIC (ath9k, I presume) does support STA and AP at the same time.</p>									</div>
