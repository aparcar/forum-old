					<p>Like any self-respecting linux-nerd I&#039;m trying to update my Whiterussian 0.9RC6 into Kamikaze on my access point. The Whiterussian is working ok and there are no problems with the firmware, except the fact that it is very old.</p><p>However, no matter what I do, Kamikaze does not seem to boot or alternatively I cannot detect any sign of life from it from default IP of 192.168.11.1, last used static IP on my network nor on wireless side. Once I even waited for 4 hours pinging and attempting to catch the wireless signal. At any point I can TFTP Whiterussian or DD-Wrt into the brick and regain control of the AP.</p><p>My initial attempts were with the firmware available at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WBR-G54">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ lo/WBR-G54</a>. As it does not yield any results I even took Firmware Mod Kit (<a href="http://www.bitsum.com/firmware_mod_kit.htm">http://www.bitsum.com/firmware_mod_kit.htm</a>) and tweaked the UCI defaults, but apparently a point where they would matter is never reached.</p><p>I&#039;ve also read forum article from <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11292">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11292</a>, but in my case tcpdumping traffic reveals that no DHCP/Bootp requests can never be found from the network on WAN or LAN ports.</p><p>During these desperate attempts I&#039;ve erased NVRAM with &quot;mtd erase nvram&quot; and I&#039;ve run DD-Wrt&#039;s &quot;Factory reset&quot; (whatever it means). Still no results. The only way anything even remotely positive can be achieved is to erase NVRAM and TFTP Kamikaze firmware in. After a minute or so wireless LED will be lit. However, nothing works and, when power is disconnected the unit gets into the default bricked state.</p><p>I&#039;d appreciate any links/pointers/info about what to try next, my ideas have run out. The unit is one of the first 802.11G access points there ever existed. It is old, I know that, but I&#039;d still like to run a reasonably new and flexible firmware on it.</p><p>Regards,<br />Jari Turkia</p>									</div>
