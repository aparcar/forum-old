					<p>Its not very clear how to do this, can some one help.</p><p>For my experiment i am using TPLINK 941 v5. works great like many other routers I have tested with openwrt.<br />Here is what I would like to do</p><br /><p>1. I want to be able to assign one port on 4 port switched router to act as the monitor port. i.e all traffic from all other ports should be visible to any computer hooked up to this port.</p><p>2. If with in openwrt shell, i want to sniff packets based on a particular port, how would I do that? I tried adding virtual interfaces like eth0.1, 2, 3, 4 etc. They show up alright in ifconfig, but can not show the traffic when I do tcpdump -i eth0.X (where x would be 1,2,3,4). There are other ways around it, but I would like to know if there is any simple way in /etc/config/network file that would allow this. i.e I should be able to access each port traffic by using virtual interface like eth0.1. </p><p>3. Is there any way where I can assign a fixed dhcp and or static address to any computer which is plugged in to lets say port 1. I know you can do some thing similar using macaddress. i.e fix it with an ip address, but is it possible to fix the ip address based on the port number. Port number being one the 4 physical lan ports.</p><p>4. What can i do in /etc/config/network file to make the router switches act like hub. i.e all physical ports will retransmit the same packet like a hub.</p><p>I did try to play with VLAN and stuff, but a) I was not able to do any of the above successfully. b) I wonder if there is any simple way. Evidently if I could do this using vlan, i have to sort of define mulitple vlans (atleast 2 or more depending upon the situation).</p><p>One more question, how do you tell which port is the cpu port ? I tried using swconfig dev switch0 show, but it does not tell you the port number of the cpu port. i.e the port attached to the router&#039;s cpu.</p><p>Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ron</strong> on 23 Feb 2013, 13:18)</p>
