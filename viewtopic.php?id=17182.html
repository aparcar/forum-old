					<p>Have been successful setting up a Asus Wl500gP(v1) with openwrt Kamikaze 2.4 but, because of obsolescence will be attempting to install and hopefully run this on a Asus Wl500gP(v2).&nbsp; Looking for anyones experience or knowledge on doing this.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will be referring to the guidelines from the Openwrt Hardware Table but, it is always helpful for someone else to share their experience....&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks&nbsp; &nbsp; Wix</p>									</div>

I believe one can differentiate which is a v1 and a v2 from their appearances. If your WL500GP looks like <a href="http://www.asus.com/products4.aspx?l1=12&amp;l2=43&amp;l3=0&amp;model=1121&amp;modelmenu=1">this</a>, then it is a v1. If it looks like <a href="http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=12&amp;l2=43&amp;l3=0&amp;l4=0&amp;model=1712&amp;modelmenu=1">this</a>, then it is a v2.</p>									</div>

					<p>From the box, V1 says &quot;WL-500g Premium&quot; and &quot;WL-500gP&quot;, and V2 just says &quot;WL-500gP V2&quot;.</p><p>Apparently V2 is no longer considered premium.</p>									</div>
