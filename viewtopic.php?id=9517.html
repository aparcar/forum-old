					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I&#039;m banging my head against the wall after a couple of days of trying to get this right and trying hard to read docs and get myself sorted out.&nbsp; </p><p>I have an ipcop machine that&#039;s running a net to net vpn to another ipcop machine and it&#039;s running great.&nbsp; </p><p>I have an openwrt install on a third network (home) with openswan installed and am trying to configure it to be another net to net vpn.</p><p>I&#039;ve got ipsec.conf configured like the examples and / or like my ipcop machines with the same result every time:</p><p>1. VPN connects, everything appears connected on Ipcop side and on Openwrt side through openswan.</p><p>2. From any machine on the IPCOP network (10.4.10.x) I can ping the open wrt box&#039;s green ip (192.168.4.1), but no other machine on the openwrt side&#039;s network.</p><p>3. From any machine on the openwrt network (192.168.4.x) I CANNOT ping any machine on the 10.4.10.x network.</p><p>4. From any machine on the openwrt network (192.168.4.x) I CANNOT ping the IPCOP machine itself (10.4.10.1)</p><p>I&#039;m almost positive this has something to do with my iptables setup.&nbsp; I struggle with iptables though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried several settings from this lists postings and openswan wiki.&nbsp; </p><p>I currently have the following:&nbsp; (Mostly commented out)</p><p>#iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -o eth0 -s 192.168.4.0/24 -d \! 10.4.10.0/24 -j MASQUERADE<br />iptables -A input_rule -p esp -s 11.111.11.11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -j ACCEPT&nbsp; # allow IPSEC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A input_rule -p udp -s 11.111.11.11 --dport 500&nbsp; -j ACCEPT&nbsp; # allow ISAKMP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />iptables -A input_rule -p udp -s 11.111.11.11 --dport 4500 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; # allow NAT-T&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />#iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -d 10.4.10.0/24 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />#iptables -A forwarding_rule -i eth1 -o ipsec0 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />#iptables -A forwarding_rule -i ipsec0 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT </p><p>I&#039;ve tried to copy the iptables rules that are on the ipcop side and it seems to work from from itself to another ipcop machine but I can&#039;t find any iptable settings that relate to the vpn connections.</p><p>Can anyone recomend something to try?&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks,<br />Stu</p>									</div>

					<p>Small Update to my own message.&nbsp; </p><p>I added a couple of iptables rules that I found in ipcop&#039;s config:</p><p>iptables -A INPUT&nbsp; &nbsp;-i ipsec+ -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A FORWARD -i ipsec+ -j ACCEPT </p><p>This allows me now to ping and connect to any computer behind the OpenWRT device from the 10.4.10.x network, but I still can&#039;t ping / connect to the computers on the remote side from behind the OpenWRT machine.</p>									</div>
