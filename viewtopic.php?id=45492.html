					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I have found lots of pointers about how to setup OpenWrt for a local Captive Portal service but, unless I&#039;m missing something, never as a client to such a service.</p><p>What I would like to achieve is for the router to sign-in to the Captive Portal via a WAN interface (wired or wireless - no matter) and <br />route to the LAN interface.</p><p>With curl I&#039;m able to retrieve all the necessary UAM parameters and I get a &quot;LoginURL&quot; returned to me. This URL simply asks me for username/password so I tried to pass that via curl with the --data argument but that failed with the error:<br /> &quot;You do not have javascript enabled.&quot;</p><p>Before I dig into this javascript issue, I&#039;m looking for some pointers to see if I&#039;m on the right track...<br /> 1) Is anybody using OpenWrt in this way ?<br /> 2) Is curl the way to go ? Or are there other packages I should be looking into ?<br /> 3) Any idea about how the next step to deal with the javascript issue ?</p><p>Thanks - any pointers appreciated !<br />/david</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick response.<br />I hadnt come across WISPr only WISP.<br />What was baffling me was the WISP password, when i know from experience most UAE challenges are 2 parts, Username and password.<br />I often visit caravan sites in the UK and the Cravan Club have a metered access, x hours at cost y. I want to make the access for my whole family simultaneous, not locked to the first mac address accessing the account. What usually happens is i login in with the mac wifi, then feed the wired access of the mac to an airport device whcih braodcasrs a second wifi network. The power and processing needed is overkill. What i need to create is a box of tricks, maybe an arduino Yun, which is logginging to the account and then feeding the wifi locally for my family.<br />I will lookinto WISPr. I liked the idea that i can give it a number of accounts, like BT Fon, and Costa Coffee, etc in a lookup table.<br />This looks to be the way forwards.<br />I have a number of Cisco Routers which are currently DD-WRT and i may look at re-firmware to openWRT and try this methosd for them.<br />So<br />Lots of research for me.<br />Thanks again</p>									</div>
