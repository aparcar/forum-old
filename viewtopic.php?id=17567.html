					<p>Reading the referenced threads, the general feeling I get is that they don&#039;t have a clue what the issue actually is, all they know is that it either works or it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; Not terribly helpful.</p><p>Yes, the firmware will have some similarities to the stock version, since it was built to run on that particular hardware, but the underpinnings are so different, it&#039;s hard to believe that it&#039;s actually a firmware issue, and may in fact more likely be some hardware issue that the freeradius software isn&#039;t compensating for.&nbsp; Of course, that&#039;s just a guess on my part...</p><p>It sounds, though, like the errors are more of an annoyance in the logs, and not something that&#039;s impacting functionality?&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case, I&#039;d tend to say just put up with the errors, and at some point when the routers get replaced through the usual course of upgrades, that you check with the freeradius list for known good models and implement those instead.</p>									</div>
