					<p>Long story short, I managed to destroy the serial port traces on my almost 5 year old TP-Link TL-WR841ND. I had this thing since I was 16, so it has been through alot. The device was working fine with OpenWRT until one day the power went out. It never booted again, it always stays with the SYS led blinking constantly. I have tried entering failsafe with no success (though the SYS led blinks faster). I had the same problem with a bad flash some months ago and was easily fixed by flashing through Uboot.</p><p>Now that serial access is... eh... impossible, how can I flash the device again? JTAG is not an option because it is not supported by the SoC. I read somewhere that people were unbricking devices by removing the flash chip and using external hardware were rewritting the bootloader. Can the same be done for the whole firmware?</p><p>Currently I&#039;m trying to locate the Flash chip on the board. I can only find one candidate but Google won&#039;t return something useful for the part number. It is displayed in the picture below (along with the destroyed serial port). The board, if I recall correctly is V3.2 (different from those on the wiki).</p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/9SHAk">http://imgur.com/9SHAk</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Some success (let&#039;s think positive). The chip was indeed the flash memory. It&#039;s an Intel (Numonyx) 320S33B. (I though it was reading 32DS33B and that explains the weird Google results).</p><p>This is the datasheet: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1733459/IC-ON-LINE.CN_qh25f320s33b8_826980.pdf">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1733459/IC-ON- â€¦ 826980.pdf</a></p><p>Time to find a tool to at least read the contents of it. Flashrom, maybe?</p>									</div>
