					<p>Hi guys<br />&nbsp; New user here. I recently manged to install openattitude on my embedded device. It works great!<br />The device has a ethernet lan interaface and a cellular 3g wan interface. Once the sim logs on it obtains a public routable ip address (i chose this type of sim because i wanted it to initiate ipsec).</p><p>In the interest of security, i installled iptables package heres where i ran into a&nbsp; light problem.</p><p>By utilisiing the zone based firewaIls &#039;device (input)&#039; I have secured the device from unauthorised incomming packets. I can also control packets originating from a device on the lan going out to the internet (nat&#039;d traffic). <br />Now the problem, when i m consoled into the device i can not seem to create&nbsp; rule to prevent packets generateed directly from the lan or wan interface to ip x.x.x.x or port.<br />I suspect its because the source does not let me specify a &#039;device&#039; zone.</p><p> Any help appreciated.</p><p>Can anyone suggest a fix for this behaviour?</p><p>Thanks guys.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>syf277</strong> on 18 Apr 2014, 17:23)</p>
