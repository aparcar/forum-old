					<p>Dear fyi,</p><p>thanks for your help but as explained your first link refer to supported webcam I tried for my pac207 (Pixart Orite SC120) that Backfire do not see when connected to the USB (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34485">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34485</a>).</p><p>The second link refer to the UVC and the Pixart Orite SC120 is a PAC207, not a UVC.<br />Otherwize I know those UVC support because Backfire well recognize my Logitech Quickcam Orbit/Sphere AF (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=156325#p156325">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 25#p156325</a>).</p><p>If you have any idea for this motion errors I would sincerely appreciate.</p><p>Have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I though it could be come from the fact there was already an external hard disk then I removed it and tried again to see if the three (normally supported by OpenWRT) could be seen with lsusb or other commands. No new /dev has been created for each three usb webcam but well with the Logitech QuickSphere AF.</p><p>I also tried again after having installed the drivers for each of those three usb webcam. Nothing détected on usb and nothing created on /dev.</p><p>As I need to buy an OpenWRT supported usb webcam I need to know where can I found the list of native Backfire 10.03.1 supported usb webcam.</p><p>Does somebody already have an idea ?</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I wouldn&#039;t expect that there would be a &quot;list of native Backfire 10.03.1 supported usb webcam[s]&quot;, but I have used the logitec Quickcam Pro 9000 and the logitec Quickcam Deluxe for Notebooks with trunk and Kamikaze.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thx Lizby,</p><p>follwing the problem I encountered with those three unsupported usb webcam it means that somenody could buy a webcam and discover it could not be supported by its router (OpenWRT). Then I presume it could be possible to know which usb webcam is natively supported on Backfire 10.03.1 and then listed somewhere to allow us to buy a supported one.</p><p>Any idea ?</p><p>Have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>maybe we could start a thread on the forum or wiki to list them all. If no one answered yet it&#039;s probably because there is no list at this point and it would be useful to start one. </p><p>Already in these post we have 4 camera and 2 that doesn&#039;t work. </p><p>I am experimenting with the eyetoy and I almost get it to work but still struggling to get anything out.</p>									</div>

					<p>So the eyetoy from Sony plauystation work really well with kmod-video-gspca-ov51 The OV519 USB Camera Driver (ov519) kernel module.</p><p>I didn&#039;t try the video output but the image from fswebcam picks them up nicely.

					<p>Dear damarusama and others,</p><p>as I did not received any list of native supported webcam (even if the drivers are available on OpenWRT Backfire 10.03.1) I opened a bug tracker ticket (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11149">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11149</a>) to see and well understand why the linux known as supported webcam can not be seen when connected to the USB port on our Backfire. All the information I gave are in this bug tracker ticket : <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11149">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11149</a>.</p><p>The three non recognized (even as USB peripheral) are :<br />Bus 002 Device 004: ID 093a:2468 Pixart Imaging, Inc. Cammaestro 2.5DU/X-EYE/Orite SC-120/ICGear TravelCam/Easy Snap Snake Eye Webcam</p><p>Bus 002 Device 005: ID 0c45:6009 Microdia VideoCAM ExpressII</p><p>Bus 002 Device 006: ID 046d:08f0 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Messenger </p><p>I think that we must in fact open a thread but first of all define what must be include for each thread. by example (one thread for workable USB Webcam and another thread for unworkable USB Webcam). We could ask to explain (for workable) how does it work (installed packages and which main packages used for the webcam (e.g. : motion detection, ...) and for non workable it must be explained how does them check it (as me : no new /dev when connected, non answer for dmesg|grep USB, no answer by using lsusb, not usable (motion program) even if webcam driver installed, ...).</p><p>Have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>
