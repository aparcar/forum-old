					<p>Hi there, I had been using BB on the wndr3700 for long time with no problems at all, I had set up a 16 gb usb stick with extroot and swap. Until one day there was a power outage in my building and the filesystem on the usb got currupted.</p><p>Now no matter what I try the usb always disconnects after some time of usage:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ 3312.090000] usb 1-1: USB disconnect, device number 2
[ 3312.130000] Buffer I/O error on dev sda1, logical block 426496, lost sync page write
[ 3312.140000] JBD2: Error -5 detected when updating journal superblock for sda1-8.</code></pre></div><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[10389.840000] usb 1-1: USB disconnect, device number 12

[10390.460000] usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -71</code></pre></div><p>I have tried different filesystems ext3, ext4 xfs and also disabling extroot and swap to only use the stick for samba.<br />I have also tried different usb sticks and the same thing happens.</p><br /><p>some help would really be appreciated.</p>									</div>
