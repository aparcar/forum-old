					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently flashed my new TP-Link WDR3600 from the original firmware to the OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09. Everything is running fine and I am pretty happy with the upgrade but there is one thing that is bothering me for which I do not know whether it is a problem in the router or the firmware or something in between. </p><p>Every 30 or so minutes (it is not a regular interval) the connection to the router drops. Firstly, it was when I was connected via 10/100 ethernet on my iMac running OSX 10.9.2. I thought it might be some software issue and cleared PRAM etc but it continued to drop every now and then. Then I thought it might be something with my wiring and decided to move to Wi-Fi on the Mac but it is still happening. It lasts only 10-20 seconds until it reconnects but it is a bit annoying when you are trying to load a page and the moment you click on the link the connection drops.</p><p>On the last drop I got this from the log:</p><p>Mar 23 06:54:04 OpenWrt daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 10:9a:dd:9f:46:80 IEEE 802.11: disconnected due to excessive missing ACKs<br />Mar 23 06:54:34 OpenWrt daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 10:9a:dd:9f:46:80 IEEE 802.11: deauthenticated due to inactivity (timer DEAUTH/REMOVE)</p><p>I looks like it explains the disconnect but I am not sure whether this is only for the Wi-Fi or could explain the ethernet drops as well. I read about it and changed the disassoc_low_ack=1 to disassoc_low_ack=0 in the config file but as far as ethernet goes is there a setting for it as well?</p>									</div>

I narrowed it down to the Dnsmasq server because for some reason I get DHCPINFORM / DHCPACK every 20-30 minutes, sometimes even in an interval of 3-5 minutes which is very disturbing...I restarted the dnsmasq on the router a few times but this does not help either <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s nothing unusal in the log, I have plenty of these too, but not experiencing disconnects or resets. I have leasetime 10 minutes on wr1043nd v2 and wr841n, both devices seem to be fine. Connection is resetting how and on what OS/device?</p>									</div>

					<p>The connection drops on my 2012 iMac running OSX 10.9.2 Mavericks. A few days ago I couldn&#039;t pinpoint to what was causing it but when I started checking the system log of the router the drop happens on every DHCPREQUEST / DHCPACK. It just drops the connection and then a few seconds later gets an IP and connection is reestablished. It is not a drop of a Internet connection but rather connection to the router. I checked the WAN, its connection is uninterrupted.</p><p>What I do not understand is when I go to the DHCP section in the router all my devices have leases ending in a few hours. My iMac currently have &quot;Leasetime remaining&quot; of 11h 57m 29s yet it dropped a few moments ago. I guess the leasetime is for 12 hours but for some reason the devices or the router wants to release/renew the lease beforehand..</p><p>In the previous post the same device is asking for a new lease in an interval of 2 minutes. I guess this is what is causing the issue.</p><p>I do not know whether it is connected to the issue or not but my mobile devices - an iPad, AppleTV and an Android phone do not get that kind of a problem but a Windows laptop does...pretty weird!</p>									</div>

					<p>You can yet try firstboot, which should reset everything to defaults, then reboot and config again. I don&#039;t have exactly your model, but openwrt is working fine for me on a range of other tp links, well except for the wifi bug, whcih has been present on AA. Btw. I&#039;ve been with dd-wrt too two years back, but I&#039;d not change it back, ever <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> DD-wrt has nicer gui, but that&#039;s the only benefit I see, which I don;t mind, because I don&#039;t use web gui at all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 28 Mar 2014, 11:01)</p>
