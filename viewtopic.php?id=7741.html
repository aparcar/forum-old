					<p>I&#039;ve downloaded and built the dg834 image (openwrt-dg834-2.4-squashfs.img) and tried installing it on my router using the vendor-supplied web interface. Although the image is the right size and the firmware update appears to succeed, when the router reboots it just stalls with alternating power and ready lights, until I use the recovery utility to reload the original firmware. The same thing happens with the jffs2 images. Am I missing something, or is this image incompatible with the DG834Gv1?</p>									</div>

					<p>Where does the AR7 wiki page even mention the DG834 image? All I can see is an explanation of how to upload the AR7 firmware (a different file entirely, named openwrt-ar7-2.4-squashfs.bin) via the ADAM2 FTP server. I tried that also, but it didn&#039;t work. What I&#039;m trying to do is install openwrt-dg834-2.4-squashfs.img (4063232 bytes, the same size as the official firmware) using the standard vendor-supplied &quot;Update Firmware&quot; interface. What&#039;s the documented step that I&#039;ve skipped?</p>									</div>
