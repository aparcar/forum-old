					<p>IANAL, but I don&#039;t see anything illegal here: if it is true that a chip layout may be copyrighted, it is not true for a PCB layout.</p><p>Recreating a PCB in CAD is not a trivial task, even less reconstructing the schematic out of it, so it is not a simple copy of an existing work. As long as you don&#039;t copy copyrighted logo or trademarks, it doesn&#039;t infringe any copyrighted material. And at least in my part of the World, reverse-engineering is legal when used for improving interoperability, which is the case here as we seek to interface the router with external devices.</p><p>Back to technical stuff: regarding RF, there are 2 different problems:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Component calibration in function of the PCB layout and characteristics, which requires a Vector Network Analyzer at least to find out the exact values for the different components present in the RF matching networks. However, the topology used in the TL-WR703N is rather standard for WiFi, with separate differential RX/TX path, so we should be able to find documentation on this calibration process. This needs to be performed only once in a lab</p></li><li><p>Production tuning, which is the purpose of the &quot;ART&quot; RF tuning. I agree that bypassing the ART in-manufacturing RF calibration is not a trivial task without having access to the original software. But if we can gather enough information on what it exactly consists in, then this may be possible. From a manufacturing point of view, it usually requires just a simple spectrum analyzer in pass/fail mode and an assembly-line small Faraday cage, which is not uncommon. For small prototype batches, a small/cheap SDR USB dongle and a tin box might prove sufficient</p></li></ol><p>Now for the price: the figures given by ZoomZoomLuke above should indicate that this might not be out of our reach...</p><p>Of course, it will be difficult to compete with the TP-Link manufacturing price and their high-volume production: my guess, given the volumes is that the BOM cost is probably &lt; $10 with packaging. Everything above that is just due to intermediate, shipping, etc. up to the $23 retail price on eBay.</p><p>With a rough fully-assembled prototype cost of $50 and a fully-assembled cost of $25/100 pieces, I think it is still a reasonable price for a device which will feature plenty of extension capabilities for hacking...</p><p>Just compare it to a $20 Arduino Pro board, or to a $35 Raspberry Pi... The closest match is the $22 Carambola board, but it is not open-hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>My 2 cents:</p><p>I lean toward not wanting to reinvent the wheel so to speak. Most of my 703&#039;s have a 8MB flash upgrade and that is enough. The USB2 requirement due to the Atheros defect is a problem that shouldn&#039;t be. I have found a USB2 4 port passive hub that fits nearly exacty the form factor of the 703 case and can be attacted to the bottom of it.</p><p>If I were given a wad of cash and told to improve the 703 without altering the factory box, I would:</p><p>1) Contact Atheros and apply pressure to fix the USB problem<br />2) Design a custom &quot;USB2 hub plus&quot; that is in a similar case that may be attached under the existing box and implements the added hardware requests through the USB interface including things like NICs and GPIO.<br />3) Ask TP-Link increase the size of the flash at the factory if they ever retool the product. The price differential between 4MB and 8MB flash is very small.<br />4) Setup a distributorship to purchase directly from TP-Link and resell to us at cost. I Estimate that the wr703n cost from the factory in bulk to be around 9 USD. This would need to be in China as the 703 isn&#039;t really certified for exports as I understand.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>perazim</strong> on 25 Dec 2012, 16:36)</p>

					<p>I made some bad experience using USB devices on my wr1043. What I did was connect a USB-I2C converter and connect it to an I2C-GPIO expander. Also, I made use of an external flash drive, all at a passive USB hub - since this seemed to be the only usable way with those Atheros SoC. This all works quite good for a certain amount of time - somehow between a few days and a few weeks. But somehow randomly I either get just a plain USB disconnect message on dmesg, or one that states some EMI problems. The result is, that all USB devices get newly detected, while the old ones are still locked. So, when calling mount, it shows up sda1, sdb1, sdc1,... although just the last one would really be present. The same with the exported GPIOs, which still somehow exist in sysfs.<br />So, in conclusion, I would not recommend to go the USB way to get GPIOs or more disk space. Better have as much of the native SoC IOs exposed and maybe go from there with SPI, I2C and SD/MMC.</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately, the AR9331 SoC used in the TL-WR703N router alerady uses the SPI bus for Flash memory (it is still possible to connect other devices on the same bus, but it is quite tricky since you will have to restore the bus as soon as the system is trying to access Flash memory) and does not feature any native I2C interface (only I2S, but that is absolutely not the same thing), nor SD/MMC interface <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>The only possibilities left are to use the few available GPIOs and I2C bit-banging, or to rely on USB with periodic system reboots or just USB power cycling.</p>									</div>
