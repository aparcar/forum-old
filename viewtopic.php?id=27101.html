					<p>Greetings,<br />I&#039;m looking for a good thread on this but havent found it yet.<br />What I would like to do is have some of the items that I normally set after each image update via web interface baked into my image.<br />For example, I want the LAN to not be &quot;static&quot; but dhcp.&nbsp; This is easy to change via the web interface, but I want it set that way when I install the image or at least on first boot.</p><p>It would appear that the file<br />/etc/config/network is what gets changed when I make the corresponding change in the web ui.<br />I tried changing that file in trunk/packages/base-files/files/etc/config/network, but it didn&#039;t seem to work.</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;defaultroute&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;peerdns&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p>After building and installing my image, I was back to &quot;static&quot; and 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Can someone please explain how etc/config/network is generated and suggest a way modify it during the build process?&nbsp; Is NVRAM involved?<br />If I can&#039;t put the change in when the image is built, can I run a script just after boot to make the changes?<br />I am using the WRT160NL with the&nbsp; r22992 version of&nbsp; OpenWRT.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>While not directly answering you question, why don&#039;t you use &quot;sysupgrade&quot; or upgrade through LuCI? Then your settings will be kept when upgrading with a new image, and you only need to set it on the very first install.</p><p>KM</p>									</div>

					<p>In menuconfig, you can make changes to the network settings in Image Configuration (but I don&#039;t know about your &quot;defaultroute&quot; or &quot;peerdns&quot;).</p><p>Alternatively, you can put your configuration in files/etc/config/network under where you have trunk installed.&nbsp; Files within the &quot;files&quot; directory are copied into your build.&nbsp; At least I think this will work--I haven&#039;t tried it with /etc/config/network.</p>									</div>

					<p>Jow and lizby&#039;s approach will apply those files to all targets that you build. If&nbsp; you are building more than 1 target but the files apply to only 1 of them, e.g. you are using OpenWRT on WRT54G and on Dockstar then an alternative is to create a files tree in the specific target directory. This would be target/linux/&lt;platform&gt;/base-files/..... , e.g. see target/linux/kirkwood as an example. If you are only building for 1 target then it doesn&#039;t matter which approach you use. Within a target you can apply to all profiles (in base-files/....) or to a specific profile (in base-files-&lt;profilename&gt;).</p><p>Gerrit</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>z80yyz</strong> on 27 Oct 2010, 00:46)</p>

					<p>Thank you all for your ideas !<br />I haven&#039;t tried this one yet,&nbsp; target/linux/&lt;platform&gt;/base-files/<br />But the suggestion of creating trunk/files/... DOES work.&nbsp; YAY!</p><p>I&#039;m left wondering why putting my change into trunk/package/base-files/files/etc/config did NOT work?&nbsp; What is that dir for then?<br />I suppose I&#039;m missing something about how the build process works.<br />If one of you gurus can explain that a bit, it would be nice. but my immediate issue is solved.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi razor,<br />All is revealed when you look at the files in &lt;topdir&gt;/includes long enough :-) E.g. target.mk covers the suggestion I made (found this feature while investigating something else). There are probably more undocumented features waiting to be used.</p><p>Gerrit</p>									</div>
