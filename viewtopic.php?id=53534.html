					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been trying to configure my router (Linksys WRT1900AC with Attitude Adjustment) to work with the VLAN of my FTTH provider while, at the same time, allowing the router provider by my ISP work as an analogue phone router (VoIP and the ISP refuses to provide the details).</p><p>The icing in the cake is that the ISP only uses one VLAN for both Data and VoIP, VID 1074, if it used two I think my life would have been like ten times easier...</p><p>So far I have managed to properly configure the wan interface (eth1) with the 1074 VID tagged, after which the router can handle the data connection and anything I plug into it through any of the interfaces (wifi, eth) works just fine.</p><p>Next step is the old router to use for the VoIP. I can barely modify any parameter in this router besides the bare basics (change IP, turn on or off the DHCP...). So I set up a switch in the eth0 interface and enable vlan4k (will provide detailed config below) and I tag one of the ports with the VID 1074 and plug a wire from that port to the WAN port of the other router. Then the other router grabs the IP through DHCP and sprouts to life making the analogue phones work. It is of note that the old router and the openWRT router are always on separate networks (192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0).</p><p>Now comes the problem... After I have made this, the remaining ports of the switch in my OpenWRT router no longer work and all my wired network stops being able to contact the router. If I add eth0 and eth0.1074 to the bridge then it just simply eats all the frames and the phone router stops working. If I add the ports either as tagged or untagged doesn&#039;t change the situation either.</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p><p>This is the /etc/config/network I have been cooking:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

If anybody can shed some light on which is the best course of action (which I will not be able to test until I get my USB-TTL wire cause I ended up bricking the router) I would be eternally grateful.</p><p>Thanks a lot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
