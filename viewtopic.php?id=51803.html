					<p>Hello,<br/>I&#039;ve upgraded my Linksys E2000 (bcm47xx) from r40772 to 14.07-rc1, r41580 (now using the subdevice mips74k image) keeping my configuration. I&#039;m using OpenWRT as bridged AP, DNS and DHCP being external. After the upgrade, my bridge over Ethernet and Wi-Fi doesn&#039;t get created automatically as before, I manually have to execute `brctl addif br-lan wl0`. Has anything changed in configuration syntax? Here the relevant parts of uci:</p><p>network.eth0=switch<br/>network.eth0.name=switch0<br/>network.eth0.reset=1<br/>network.eth0.enable=1<br/>network.eth0.enable_vlan=1<br/>network.eth0_1=switch_vlan<br/>network.eth0_1.device=switch0<br/>network.eth0_1.vlan=1<br/>network.eth0_1.ports=0 1 2 3 4 8<br/>network.lan=interface<br/>network.lan.ifname=eth0<br/>network.lan.type=bridge<br/>network.lan.proto=static<br/>network.lan.hostname=OpenWrt<br/>network.lan.ipaddr=192.168.0.2<br/>network.lan.netmask=255.255.255.0<br/>network.lan.gateway=192.168.0.1</p><p>wireless.wl0=wifi-device<br/>wireless.wl0.type=broadcom<br/>wireless.@wifi-iface[0]=wifi-iface<br/>wireless.@wifi-iface[0].device=wl0<br/>wireless.@wifi-iface[0].mode=ap<br/>wireless.@wifi-iface[0].network=lan</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, that might explain it. Normally hostapd is responsible for adding the interface to the bridge once created. Going from AA to BB they switched from the legacy &#039;wifi&#039; scripts to a netifd-based system. I don&#039;t know what the underlying changes are but it could be that something for legacy drivers has been missed out or deprecated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just tried to reproduce this with current trunk and there it works with BCM4716 wifi. Does this problem still exist for you in trunk?</p>									</div>
