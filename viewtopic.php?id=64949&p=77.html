I figured it out.&nbsp; The global settings (country code 98 for whatever reason), are the overlapping settings of phy0 and ph1 which are set to Canada and phy2 which are set to USA.&nbsp; The global settings only include those frequencies and settings which are allowed in both CA and US.&nbsp; Why it&#039;s country code 98 I have no idea.&nbsp; And why phy2 is set to US instead of CA is the real question.</p><p>Edit4: Found this: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The value 98 represents a synthesized regulatory domain, based on the intersection of the available source of regulatory information (which can include the EEPROM, the userland setting, and a country IE from your AP).</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 19 May 2017, 04:38)</p>

Still, just by using a Wifi Analyzer, I can see what&#039;s on all the channels including the widths of each. And yeah, I can simply change to the same channel, and all it takes is a little traffic, and it will bounce. Observing over time, wifi is always looking for the least populated channel, so if I vacate a DFS channel, after a while it will go back over to it, and sometimes I see it on other DFS channels. So, there&#039;s some kind of logic behind how it works with DFS, and though easily run off a channel, it will go to other DFS or nonDFS channels at will.</p>									</div>

I don&#039;t know what model router directTV uses, but apparently it is broken in the same way. Prime example of a wifi router not sensing radar properly.</p></blockquote></div><p>Completely off topic, but DirecTV doesn&#039;t use or provide routers. He most likely just set the SSID of his router to DirecTV and has his DirecTV receiver connected via that SSID <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>But basically what you are saying is you can get his router to change channels by setting yours to the same DFS channel as his?</p></blockquote></div><p>Being that directTV is now owned by at&amp;t, it&#039;s probably a at&amp;t router connecting to a direcTV Genie on 5Ghz using that SSID. Still, just by using a Wifi Analyzer, I can see what&#039;s on all the channels including the widths of each. And yeah, I can simply change to the same channel, and all it takes is a little traffic, and it will bounce. Observing over time, wifi is always looking for the least populated channel, so if I vacate a DFS channel, after a while it will go back over to it, and sometimes I see it on other DFS channels. So, there&#039;s some kind of logic behind how it works with DFS, and though easily run off a channel, it will go to other DFS or nonDFS channels at will.</p></blockquote></div><p>But if DFS is working properly, it isn&#039;t supposed to just cower off a channel just because another router is using the same channel or stray interference interfering.&nbsp; There is a special, very unique patter or patterns of signals or interference it is meant to detect to trigger a radar warning and force a channel switch.&nbsp; Obviously some or most routers at this point aren&#039;t implementing DFS properly and switch if there is anything on that channel as you said.&nbsp; I believe the 3200ACM is one of the first to actually try to implement DFS properly and hence the extra 1x1:1 5GHz 88W8887 radio it has.</p><p>About DirecTV and AT&amp;T, good point, they could have AT&amp;T UVerse Internet and an AT&amp;T modem/router combo.&nbsp; But since eventually DirecTV will be called AT&amp;T, and not the other way around, it&#039;s highly unlikely the default SSID would be DirecTV; if anything it would be AT&amp;T.&nbsp; And I know from experience, DirecTV installers simply connect the Genie receiver to Cat5 if it is available, or to WiFi if it is not.&nbsp; They don&#039;t set the SSID to DirecTV or mess with the router at all (most are too dumb and it&#039;s not part of their training, nor something they are even supposed to do when installing).&nbsp; So most likely your neighbor changed his router (whether it&#039;s an AT&amp;T one or not) to have a special SSID just for his DirecTV Genie.&nbsp; I did a similar thing creating a VLAN with LAN port 4 just for my DirecTV Genie (which then communicates with the other receivers over coax).&nbsp; Main reason being DirecTV receivers are constantly pinging (every second) to find other receivers that may be connected and to keep in contact with the receivers which are connected and I didn&#039;t want all that spam going over the rest of my LAN.</p><p>Edit: The DFS behavior your referred to in the second half of your message, I&#039;m guessing that is behavior you have observed on a 3200ACM?&nbsp; Not on a 1200/1900AC/ACS?&nbsp; And is that if your have the channel set to Auto?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 19 May 2017, 17:12)</p>

					<p>There&#039;s a mad-house going on in the DFS issue thread on github for mwlwifi.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my opinion.&nbsp; Yes, the stock firmware doesn&#039;t allow DFS channels on the 1200/1900ac/acs.&nbsp; But LEDE does, and DFS is functional in LEDE with the current version of mwlwifi, just extremely too sensitive.&nbsp; So why not simply fix it?&nbsp; There&#039;s no law that says mwlwifi combined with LEDE can&#039;t be better than the stock linksys driver and firmware.&nbsp; That&#039;s the point, isn&#039;t it?&nbsp; lol</p><p>Second issue.&nbsp; As @farchord mentioned above, the third radio in the 3200ACM (the 88W8887, which is a 1x1:1 ac radio) in LEDE can be disabled or used as an AP.&nbsp; This is obviously not how it was meant to be used.&nbsp; It was meant ONLY to detect radar/aid in DFS, and how it is used in the stock Linksys firmware.&nbsp; Since the 88W8887 isn&#039;t being used as a DFS suppliment in LEDE at the current time, the DFS behavior of the 3200ACM should be practically identical to that of the 1200/1900ac/acs (I say practically because apparently the 88W8964 handles DFS better by itself than the 88W8864; but there is no additional DFS code in mwlwifi that only applies to the 88W8964/3200ACM).&nbsp; </p><p>Since the 88W8887 isn&#039;t being used as a DFS monitor in LEDE, the 3200ACM is no more &quot;authorized&quot; to use the DFS channels than the 1200/1900ac/acs.&nbsp; The only reason the 3200ACM was FCC authorized to access DFS channels was because of the 88W8887 monitor.</p><p>Regardless, at least since I have a 1200 V1, I can apply that hack and don&#039;t have to worry about DFS at all.</p><p>But definitely, DFS isn&#039;t being used correctly on the 3200ACM in LEDE.&nbsp; If it were, you shouldn&#039;t be able to see or alter radio2 (88W8887) at all.&nbsp; It should be used in the background to monitor for radar on the same wifi channel radio0 is connected to.&nbsp; That is what it is meant for.&nbsp; That is all it is meant for.&nbsp; But mwlwifi won&#039;t and can&#039;t fix this behavior.&nbsp; The 88W8887 uses the mwiflex driver, not mwlwifi.&nbsp; So what we are missing is some algorithm or something that makes the 88W8887 (radio2) behave as the DFS monitor and communicate with the 88W8964 (radio0) to tell it that radar is detected and to change channels.&nbsp; The more I think of it, for the 3200ACM, DFS detection shouldn&#039;t even be included or handled by the mwlwifi driver.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 21 May 2017, 02:05)</p>
