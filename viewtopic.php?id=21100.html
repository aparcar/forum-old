Now I have to find an Atheros Wlan card. Does any Atheros chip work or do I have to look for certain chipsets?<br />Is there a list somewhere which mini-pci cards use which chipset?</p><p>thx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; sven</p>									</div>

					<p>I accidentally stumbled over this post, so sorry for digging it up again...</p><p>An old Atheros card didn&#039;t work well in my ASUS WL500GP V1, so I bought a new one which works like a charm.</p><p>TL-WN961N -&gt; 300Mbit Draft n 2.0 (new Atheros Chipset)<br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/products/product_des.asp?id=138">http://www.tp-link.com/products/product_des.asp?id=138</a></p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20573">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20573</a>&nbsp; &lt;- explaination, why the old one didn&#039;t work.</p><p>As mentioned in the other thread, it only does B G with the current Openwrt ATH driver. When the new openwrt atk5k is stable, you will be able to switch the card to N.</p><p>However since the N standard has been published on October 29 2009 there probably will be non-draft N products shortly.<br />(The strange thing is that I don&#039;t read anyting about &quot;draft-n&quot; on the vendor website anymore - however there is also no recent firmware update available for the card. So it seems as if the card already complies with the final standard.)</p><p>lg, Mr.M</p><p>Edit: corrected a typo.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mr.m</strong> on 23 Nov 2009, 14:39)</p>
