					<p>I have tried many loads and cannot figure out why I cannot telnet to my TL-WR703N v1.7. My laptop has a static IP of 192.168.1.100 with a mask of&nbsp; 255.255.255.0 and the laptop&#039;s eth0 Ethernet cable is directly connected to the TL-WR703N&#039;s Ethernet port. My current TL-WR703N load is &#039;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin&#039; from &#039;<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ x/generic/</a>&#039; but I&#039;ve tried numerous other binaries from multiple places. As soon as the load is finished (I am loading via serial) I attempt to &quot;telnet 192.168.1.1&quot; and it fails &quot;Unable to connect to remote: no route to host&quot;. I have tested SSH to another Linux box (passworded so need ssh) with success so the laptop&#039;s network setup is ok. I have tried multiple Ethernet cables, even a turnover cable. I cannot figure out why I cannot telnet to a virgin OpenWRT TL-703N load when everyone else seems to be able to do so. Any ideas? Help will be much appreciated as this is driving me nuts.</p><p>SOLVED - Never mind. Apparently I was a victim of the v1.7 eth bug. I just installed &#039;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin&#039; as posted by nebbia88 on December 30th, which has the Ethernet fox for v1.7. As soon as I installed this telnet worked!</p><p>A question, however - are there ANY builds in the main distribution that will work with v1.7?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>celem</strong> on 28 Feb 2013, 23:26)</p>

					<p>I think that bug was fixed in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/35037">r35037</a> so you&#039;ll have to use a snapshot build.</p>									</div>
