					<p>Not sure how to feasibly do it all from the same box (router). But I believe it is possible if transmission was running on another local device (route all traffic from this device to the VPN). Maybe you could assign a second IP address to the router LAN interface and then bind transmission to that IP (or bind it to your VPN IP) then route all traffic from that IP to the VPN? Just initial thoughts.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 15 May 2016, 00:42)</p>
