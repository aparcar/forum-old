					<p>Hi there, I&#039;m planning on deploying a Hotspot based on OpenWRT and have some questions on how to build a fool-proof system (because of non-techie users) which is still secure.<br />Here is my basic plan:<br />1. Setup OpenWRT on my router (IP 10.200.0.254)<br />2. Use WPA-PSK for security and set ESSID to &quot;My Hotspot - Key myhotspot&quot;<br />3. Set ap_isolate=1 (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=6644">According to this post</a>)<br />4. Enable DHCP (Range 10.200.0.100 - 10.200.0.200)<br />With these two simple steps everyone should be able to connect to the network and securely transmit data to the router (as far as i understand WPA, but I might be wrong!)</p><p>Those three steps were quite easy, but now I want to force the users to do some kind of authorization.<br />After the user connected to the wireless he should get a basic Login/Register screen with every website he opens.<br />5. Setup DNS to reply to any request by wireless clients with 10.200.0.250 (wired clients should be able to use DNS as usual)<br />6. Disable any routing of wireless client traffic to the internet (wired clients should be able to use the router to access the internet as usual)</p><p>If a unauth&#039;d client now opens any website he should get a message &quot;Welcome to my Hotspot, please login or register: [...]&quot;.<br />7. After a client successfully auth&#039;d he should get correct DNS replies<br />8. Client traffic should be routed to the internet until he disconnects from the wireless (Maybe I use pinging to detect whether a client is still active or if his session should be terminated, but thats not important yet)</p><p>Creating the website, Account management and altering the routes is nothing new to me (though I&#039;ve to admit the routes thing might be tricky), but I have no clue how to achieve the &quot;Forwarding&quot; in steps 5. and 7.<br />I know German T-Com uses some kind of &quot;Forwarding&quot; at their hotspots (and I guess most hotspots do that), but how?<br />Does someone know how the forwarding works or has a idea how it might work? (or maybe even as little as the name of this technique?)</p><p>Sebastian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>archimedes</strong> on 5 Jul 2007, 01:09)</p>

					<p>So you put the PSK in the SSID, and this is secure? Hmm.....</p><p>I don&#039;t think you have thought this cunning plan all the way through.</p><p>I use unencrypted WiFi all the time.&nbsp; I look for padlock in browser, or use OpenVPN, or tunnel traffic through SSH.&nbsp; &nbsp;Trusting your data to the encryption developed by people who make WiFi hardware, has historically not worked out very well.&nbsp; End-to-end encryption is always better than client to AP encryption.</p><p>IMHO.</p>									</div>

					<p>Of course I use VPN, ssh tunnels and https (and IMAP via SSL/TLS), but I study informatics and have some basic clue about security and systemadministration <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Setting up a OpenWRT with OpenVPN would be a very easy way and if it was for my private home WLAN I&#039;d use it, but I&#039;d like to deploy a public (free) hotspot and I believe there will be many customers who don&#039;t know how to configure their notebook/pda with OpenVPN or OpenSWAN...</p><p>As far as I understood WPA-PSK a client only needs the key to gain access, but he only can decrypt traffic which is send to him using a key assigned to him by the AP. (Some kind of magical, wireless PKI) - But I can&#039;t find any proof/information on that, so this is only a shoot into the blue (and thats one of the reasons I&#039;m asking here)...<br />Any idea?</p><p>//edit:<br />WPA-PSK uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Key_Integrity_Protocol">TKIP and according to Wikipedia TKIP</a> seems to prohibit sniffing of Client to AP traffic even if an intruder knows the PSK and is logged into the network...<br />Though: Maybe someone with two WLAN clients could check this by using wireshark on a client which is connected to an OpenWRT with ap_isolate turned on?<br />(I only have my notebook and some SMC Router at my flat, but I&#039;ll try to get a second client and a OpenWRT during the weekend <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> )</p><p>//edit2:<br />I&#039;m still wondering about the User Authentication? Maybe a transparent proxy?</p><p>-OR-<br />Can I setup two SSIDs, one without encryption for user registration (every website should be redirected to a secured registration form) and another with WPA-Enterprise and Radius authentication?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>archimedes</strong> on 5 Jul 2007, 01:59)</p>
