					<p>First off, a couple of things folks.<br />1. I know NOTHING of Linux. Yea, strike 1 against me, I know.<br />2. Therefore, I work completely in Windows XP Pro.</p><p>What I want to accomplish is this:<br />I want my router to work like a HOSTS file/Restricted site blocker. However, without the limitations of the HOSTS file. Instead of only being able to block {Ad1.website.com} and/or {Ad2.website.com} I would like to be able to just add {*.website.com}. I have multiple computers at home and it would be easier to just add &quot;dangerous&quot; or unwanted sites directly to my router.<br />I do NOT need wireless functionality.<br />I do NOT need VPN, ect.<br />I get on the internet for research and gaming. I may connect to an FTP through FireFTP in Firefox, but that&#039;s about it.</p><p>My understanding is that Openwrt makes this possible... but damned if I can make sense of the readme files and so forth. If anyone would be kind to walk me through it I would be GREATLY appreciative. Hell, don&#039;t worry about what hardware I have... if you know a specific router (non-wireless preferred) to do this with I&#039;ll go buy the damned thing. Just walk me through what I need to download and how to set it up with my Windows XP system. And how to occasionally update the file with all the IP/web addresses I want to block.</p><p>THANK YOU!</p>									</div>

					<p>You should really get into HyperWRt if you have such a router (WRT54G). It does everything through a (relatively) simple web interface. OpenWRT is tough for me, and I have about a year of Linux experience (which doesn&#039;t appear to amount to much as I work with Open WRT).</p><p><a href="http://thibor.co.uk">http://thibor.co.uk</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>napierzaza</strong> on 24 Apr 2006, 00:37)</p>

					<p>you really need alot more in the way of networking knowledge than linux knowledge... i only have about 6 months of linux knowledge (admittedly alot done in those 6 months) and found openwrt relativley easy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>well, there&#039;s nothing wrong with using tinyproxy, it blocks websites just as well as a regular proxy server, I just mean that if you intend to block a LARGE amount of websites (1000+ would be a very rough estimate depending on what else is running on your router/how busy your network is), you may run out of cpu cycles and take a preformance hit.</p><p>The only thing that limits the wrt is it&#039;s processor speed and it&#039;s memory.</p><p>*hits himself on head for not remembering* lol... duh... you could also block the ip of the websites with iptables by using the builtin firewall</p><p>edit /etc/config/firewall<br />drop:src=&lt;ip&gt; (not too sure of you can use a range of IPs. you could probably do IP/netmask but not sure)<br />reboot</p><p>Please note that I had been looking into using my router to act like peer guardian, but i discovered that there were too many ips to effectivley block using iptables (or a proxy server) due to the CPU. If you have less than the number of IPs peerguardian blocks, you should be fine =)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eatnumber1</strong> on 26 Apr 2006, 10:21)</p>

					<p>By IPTables, you mean the routing tables that damn near every router has built-in? I never thought about using those as a &quot;block&quot;. I just associated them with setting up FTPs and getting specific games through your firewall. </p><p>I tend to download updated HOSTS files from:<br /><a href="http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.zip">http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.zip</a></p><p>But keeping it updated on everyone&#039;s computer... not to mention friends/reletives that come over with their own systems... is a pain in the ass. I just want to have a low-maintainance, one-stop block for all these ad-sites, porn sites, ect.</p>									</div>

					<p>The router is not fast enough to block that many IPs. You may want to look into peerguardian, which automates the blocking, but as I said, you can&#039;t do it on a wrt. <a href="http://phoenixlabs.org">http://phoenixlabs.org</a>/ All you&#039;d have to do is install peerguardian on all the computers, and it would automatically update. I don&#039;t believe it blocks porn sites tho (i may be wrong)... Just ads and viruses and RIAA etc...</p><p>Also, iptables is what is used to tell a linux computer what to do with packets. <a href="http://www.netfilter.org">http://www.netfilter.org</a>/<br />So if (for whatever reason) you wanted to block all udp traffic and reply with an icmp unreachable message, you could do that with iptables, or if you wanted to block all packets coming from or going to a certain ip, you could do that using iptables.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eatnumber1</strong> on 26 Apr 2006, 10:23)</p>
