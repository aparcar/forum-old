					<p>I am looking to buy a new 802.11ac router/AP for my home and was looking at the TP-Link AC2600. However, TP-Link&#039;s recent statement of intent to lock out OpenWRT use combined with the pricing+flash difference with the Amped AC2600 had me looking at it as an alternative.</p><p>The TP-Link AC2600, Amped AC2600, and Linksys EA8500 are all pretty much identical as far as SoC and radios go. However, the TP-Link only has 32MB of flash while the other two have 128MB. On the downside, the Amped has 1 USB3 port and 1 USB2 port instead of 2 USB3 ports, but this isn&#039;t a problem for me.</p><p>SmallNetBuiler has some reviews on all three with interior pictures:</p><p><a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32799-amped-wireless-athena-rta2600-high-power-ac2600-wi-fi-router-with-mu-mimo-reviewed">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless … o-reviewed</a></p><p><a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32871-tp-link-archer-c2600-ac-2600-wireless-dual-band-gigabit-router-reviewed">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless … r-reviewed</a></p><p>As I write this, work is still being done on the TP-Link AC2600 to get it operating and stable. It&#039;s not ready for use with OpenWRT as far as I am concerned, but it looks like that&#039;s just a matter of working out bugs in the new hardware:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54973">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54973</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmomo</strong> on 25 Mar 2016, 09:23)</p>

					<p>One problem for supporting the Athena model is that Amped won&#039;t provide the GPL source. I asked them for it when I was trying to compare source between the Archer C2600 and other routers, and they basically said &quot;no, we don&#039;t do that&quot;.</p>									</div>
