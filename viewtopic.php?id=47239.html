					<p>Hi guys!</p><p>Preface:<br />I have a Logitech c270 camera that supports YUV and MJPG, but doesn&#039;t support H.264. (See </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> v4l2-ctl --list-formats </code></pre></div><p> for your own webcam.) Thus (due to the hardware limitations of my openwrt box) it is not realistic to make live mixed audio+video streaming with it. Oh, the camera also features a microphone.<br />Using mjpg-streamer it was a piece of cake to fire up video streaming, and because of the hardware support it makes not much of CPU load.<br />On the other hand I am unable to set up a CPU friendly independent audio streaming over the internet. I only have partial solutions: Using ffmpeg and ffplay I could stream live (mp2) audio with reasonably low load - on home LAN. Oppositely, using darkice and icecast I could stream live audio over internet - causing painfully high load due to the on-the-fly mp3 conversion. Neither using IceS would be a breakthrough because of the on-the-fly ogg conversion.</p><p>My problem:<br />I&#039;m seeking a CPU load friendly way to stream live audio over the internet.<br />There may exist a stream source that uses wav and can cooperate with icecast. Or probably some gstreamer magic?</p><p>Any answers and suggestions appreciated!</p>									</div>
