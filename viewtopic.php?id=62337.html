					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have cloned the 15.05 / CC OpenWrt repository via git some time ago, gone through the &#039;make menuconfig&#039; process where I have selected all the modules and packages that I wanted to include in my image and successfully built the firmware for my router model.</p><p>I would now like to build a new image for my router, but this time from the main development tree (bleeding edge, if you will).</p><p>How would one proceed in that case without having to go through the make menuconfig process from scratch and manually select everything again?</p><p>Is this possible? Can I just copy my .config file without risk of losing or damaging something (I&#039;m guessing no, which is why I ask)?</p><p>What&#039;s the best practice?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Go to your CC tree, run </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/diffconfig.sh &gt; ~/myCCconfig</code></pre></div><p> It outputs the difference between the default config and your own config, instead of the complete config. Copy the myCCconfig file in your home directory to your trunk directory, save it as .config. Run make defconfig, it will take your specific config choices and build a full config based on it. Then run make to build it.</p><p>It might not work completely, packages may have renamed config options and stuff like that, but you can try it out.</p>									</div>
