					<p>Hi all,<br />I am in need of a bit of networking help, I have been using OpenWRT on my home router for quite a long time (G604T) and its been running very well. But the network needs a bit of an overhaul as I am looking to separate my network into two parts, a private and public part.<br />At the moment we are running one big network with some of our computers wired, with a wireless cloud which serves some holiday lets which some of our laptops also connect too.<br />What would be the best way to separate these networks without getting another DSL line, I have been thinking about setting up my house with a private AP we can connect our laptops too and allow us to connect to the routers ethernet.<br />Then have one port on the routers ethernet defined as the public port going to a switch so I can run ethernet cables to the APs in each house (we have thick walls which messes with WDS, so this would help wifi speed).</p><p>What are peoples thoughts on this, does that approach sound ok? Or will I need to get another router and attach it to the public DSL one and use it as the private one, but ideally I would like to apply some QoS to the public side so they dont nab all of the bandwidth.<br />Thanks for the time and sorry for the rambling nature, amusing network picture available on request.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wipster</strong> on 27 Jul 2010, 20:06)</p>

					<p>Your approach sounds reasonable if you do not want to invest into too much hardware. Put some vlan capable openwrt supported device in front of the dsl uplink, allocate one extra port for the public network and use some trivial qos rules to limit that to a certain amount of bandwidth.</p><p>~ Jow</p>									</div>

					<p>Excellent thanks Jow, do you happen to have any recommendation of vlan capable DSL modem/routers which openwrt supports? The common makes in the UK I can think of such as Netgear used to use very small amounts of flash.</p>									</div>
