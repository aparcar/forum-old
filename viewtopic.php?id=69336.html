					<p>Firstly, apologies for the elementary nature of these questions. I have no knowledge of Linux/scripts/programming etc. </p><p>For a couple of years, I have been using a D-Link travel router in hotel rooms to &quot;grab&quot; the hotel wifi and share it to the local wifi devices. I now need to be able to be able to incorporate VPN and have read that this router is able to have the WAN setup configured to accommodate this.&nbsp; However, my reading of the various setup info suggests that the hotel connection needs to be wired.</p><p>I have been researching and understand that OpenWRT is compatible with this router.</p><p>Will Open-WRT provide this capability? Do I need Linux knowledge or is there a &quot;Dummies&quot; guide to nurse me through?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
