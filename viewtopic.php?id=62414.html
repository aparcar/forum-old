					<p>I just bought this one without thinking straight. <br />I wanted to use it as a repeater, which it (kind of) advertises on its box. There is no other interface language than Japanese. :\</p><p>Sadly I have to report that trying to install either of the firmwares you linked through the interface does exactly nothing.</p><p>*EDITED to remove insults to Buffalo, since I noticed I could use it as a repeater anyways. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>compul</strong> on 17 Jan 2017, 08:01)</p>
