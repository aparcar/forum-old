					<p>I have no doubt there is a FAQ or HOWTO for this, but every one I&#039;ve found was for the previous version of OpenWRT, and uses NVRAM commands.</p><p>I have a WRT54G that I want to turn into a semi-transparent bridge, ie, puts every interface on the same subnet. Essentially, I want all of the wired and wireless interfaces to seem as if they are on one big switch - so that wireless clients can transparently access the network as if they were on the wired network. If necessary, I could live without all of the Ethernet ports, since I already have a switch, but the WRT54G will be sitting on my desk, and sometimes an extra switch port is handy.</p><p>I will probably need to do some MAC filtering or firewalling of the wireless port - for obvious security reasons, but I want valid clients to seem like they have a long cable plugged in.</p><p>I also need the &#039;bridge&#039; to have an IP address for configuration purposes, and it would be nice if the IP was obtained via DHCP - but I can live with static if absolutely necessary. (I manage all IP&#039;s via the DNS server) This is primarily so that I can configure the firewall and manage wireless security.</p><p>This machine will do nothing else. I have DNS and DHCP running on a separate firewall/router. Though it seems a bit of a waste for such a &#039;big&#039; machine (This is a v4 router that I&#039;ve upgrade the RAM to 32MB DRAM), the Linky seems to play better with Intel based wireless chipsets.</p><p>Does anyone know where I can find a kamikaze specific HOWTO or FAQ that handles this? I&#039;ve been playing with 7.09 as an embedded development platform, but I&#039;ve only used client networking. This is the first time I&#039;ve tried to bring a machine up as a network appliance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you added lan&lt;-&gt;lan forwarding in your firewall?&nbsp; This allows wireless clients on a bridge to talk to wired clients on the same bridge and vice versa.<br />Kind of counter-intuitive but I suppose it allows for more flexibility if you do want to isolate wireless and wired clients.</p><p>/etc/config/firewall</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config forwarding

					<p>Yes. The firewall is minimally configured.</p><p>I did setup my wireless config with a static IP address and connected. I was unable to ping the bridge (192.168.0.7) despite having a local IP address of 192.168.0.254. Windows did report that I was connected, and I could ping the local interface, but nothing else.</p>									</div>
