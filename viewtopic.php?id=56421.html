					<p>Hello, I am trying to help my local town with a project. I would like to provide public WiFi access on a ~1 mile stretch on our Main St. I would like to use something open source for the software, something like OpenWRT. One concern of mine is that open source software generally does not come with any warranty or guarantees that everything will perform correctly. While that does not bother me personally, it may be a problem to the town leaders, as I need to sell them this idea. I am seeking advice as to:</p><p>1) What kind of hardware (that can run alternate firmware) would you suggest for deploying a public wifi system? I am looking for cost effective solutions, and of course the access points need to be weather resistant as they will likely be mounted outdoors.<br />2) What firmware would you run on it? Is there something like OpenWRT made specifically for open public wifi systems?<br />3) Is it possible to provide security (encryption of some sort) to the end user, while leaving the system open for all to access? Perhaps some sort of captive portal that assigns a temporary username and password to the user? If so, how would I configure it so that the log-in process is straight forward and easy to use?<br />4) Any other pointers/tips/suggestions for a project like this?</p><p>Any ideas would be very appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>While I personally don&#039;t have experience with this, you should search for &quot;freifunk&quot;. It&#039;s a community who, among other things, provide openwrt-based firmware for exactly what you want: public and open wifi, the goal being that of providing mesh communications (i.e. not requiring each AP to be a gateway to Internet).</p><p>Please note that an open AP will have no encryption. This is supposed to be a good thing, given that you want to be, huh, open :). I personally dislike captive portals and anything that requires some manual action. These days everybody should be aware about what you can and what you cannot do on a public network.</p>									</div>

					<p>Awesome, many thanks! Enjoyed the ironic pun too. Although this looks like more like a meshnet solution, I do agree that captive portals are lame and these days everyone should assume they&#039;re data is being intercepted public networks. Ironically one of the reasons I wanted a captive portal was to inform people that they should not trust the network, and offer links to resources on how to protect themselves, such as how to set up a VPN, using tools like https everywhere, ect.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>OpenEverything</strong> on 23 Mar 2015, 17:21)</p>
