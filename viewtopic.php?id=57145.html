					<p>Even though I have been using openwrt for years, I suddenly can&#039;t seem to figure out how to do some thing as simple as open and forward a port.. Sorry for my stupidity..</p><p>I want to forward a port (say 8080) from WAN to LAN to a specific computer to SSH in to..<br />I can SSH in to this computer fine from with in the LAN..<br />But port-checking websites still say port 8080 is closed from the outside (WAN)..</p><p>So far I have tried this:<br />In the firewall page, allow receiving, sending, and forwarding to/from the WAN zone..<br />In the port-forwarding page, I made a rule saying to forward any thing from WAN that is trying to access port 8080 to forward to LAN (to the computer running SSH server) on port 8080..<br />In the traffic rules I have allowed port 8080 from any host and any zone..<br />In desperation I made an other traffic rule to allow any traffic from WAN to access any place on LAN, and I put this rule at the very top so it would be checked first..</p><p>My settings make it seem like all computers from the internet can access my entire LAN, and literally I can see nothing that is rejecting any thing any where, yet every check-port site I try still says port 8080 is closed, even though I can SSH in to that same port and computer from with in the LAN..</p><p>What am I missing here?..</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah you were right..<br />raspbmc by default makes the iptables deny any incoming connections that aren&#039;t from the local sub-net.. So I have to either change the iptable rules on that or just remove iptables entirely from it since I use the router as a firewall any way..<br />Any way, thank you for your help..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Baconmon</strong> on 4 May 2015, 13:52)</p>

					<p>If I remember correctly, you can easily disable the firewall entirely in raspbmc, or you can just edit &quot;/etc/network/if-up.d/secure-rmc&quot; and add your own rules there. I moved to raspbian recently, but I probably still keep my config files somewhere.</p>									</div>
