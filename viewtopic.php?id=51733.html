This means OpenWRT eth0 connects to HostOnly and eth1 to Bridged. Is this correct, or should I do it the other way around? When creaating eth1 in Luci, should I bridge it with eth0?</p><p>Thanks and Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Host Environment: ADSL --- FreeBSD Host NIC_0 on 192.168.1.0/24 (Host gateway)<br />Host also has NIC_1 on 192.168.2.0/26<br />vlan_NIC_vboxnet0 on 192.168.56.1/28<br />vlan_NIC_lo2 with several aliases starting from 192.168.2.*/32. These are jails which run caching services.</p><br /><p>* PF is configured to route all outbound traffic originating from NIC_1 and vboxnet0 to the jails.<br />* I know any VMGuest can access the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet if I were to set network as NAT or Bridged, but this is not what I want.<br />* HostOnly is the only way to route all VMGuest traffic through Host firewall and jails. This is what I want.<br />* The 192.168.2.0/26 subnet is used for testing and is not a production network. The whole purpose here is to get all my configuration files in OpenWRT correct so that I can simply transfer/copy those files to a real production device. When configuring OpenWRT, I will define a bridged NIC from VM to face this subnet to simulate the LAN clients in the production environment. The bridged NIC will have IP=192.168.2.10/26, and I will disable routing from NIC_1 on host (192.168.2.1/26) so that during testing, it will be OpenWRT doing the routing (from NIC_1 to 192.168.56.0 subnet only) and not Host.<br />* When I setup dnsmasq in the OpenWRT instance, it will forward all DNS queries to the DNS-cache jail running on 192.168.2.*/32, and http queries to a separate jail. Host will take care of this and OpenWRT will have no control over traffic leaving the 192.168.56.0 subnet for the real (host) gateway. This can only be done with HostOnly.</p>									</div>
