					<p>I read up on dnsmasq and I want to use the router to cache some names automatically. I see in the documentation there is a setting for cache size. Default is 150 names I believe.&nbsp; I open my /etc/dnsmasq.conf in vi and notice the chche setting is not in there :</p><p># filter what we send upstream<br />domain-needed<br />bogus-priv<br />filterwin2k<br />localise-queries</p><p># allow /etc/hosts and dhcp lookups via *.lan<br />local=/lan/<br />domain=lan<br />expand-hosts</p><p># enable dhcp (start,end,netmask,leasetime)<br />dhcp-authoritative<br />#dhcp-range=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.250,255.255.255.0,12h<br />dhcp-leasefile=/tmp/dhcp.leases</p><p># use /etc/ethers for static hosts; same format as --dhcp-host<br /># &lt;hwaddr&gt; &lt;ipaddr&gt;<br />read-ethers</p><p># other useful options:<br /># default route(s): dhcp-option=3,192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; dns server(s): dhcp-option=6,192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2</p><br /><p>I noticed the is no cache-size=150 in there. does that mean it doesn&#039;t do caching by default. So anyway I try and add the line cache-size=300 to my config in vi. I cant save it. I figure its because dnsmasq is running so I kill it first and try to save. still no go. How to I get my chaching to work and use a value of 300?</p>									</div>
