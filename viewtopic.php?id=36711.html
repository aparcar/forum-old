					<p>Hello there! I&#039;m an openwrt newbie: I have worked with linux before on laptops and tablets, but I&#039;m trying to get a feel for using it in access points. I looked through the supported hardware list but got confused as to what access point I should buy?</p><p>My requirements: Needs to support the latest OpenWRT releases, and (obviously) WiFi. I&#039;d also like USB 2.0 ports, in which I intend to plug in my bluetooth usb dongle. I&#039;d like to use it as a test box for testing some packages, so things like cpu power, storage (even usb based), flash etc should be sufficient. ie the more the better! Also a reliable hardware platform would be nice..</p><p>costwise, I&#039;m flexible as long as it doesnt burn too deep a hole in the pocket.</p><p>I know most of you are going &quot;it all depends on what you want to do/how much you want to pay&quot; etc, but even a few hints of what&#039;s good to get would be a starting point for me to check out the AP specs and decide what fits my needs..</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>I love the wndr3700 v1 and v2, however the new v3 isn&#039;t compatible. v2 is the best IMHO, usb, 16mb flash, 2.4ghz and 5ghz radios and gigabyte ethernet!</p><p>to bad they killed openwrt support in v3...maybe you can find a used one someplace?</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Any thoughts on the ASUS WL500-W? Now it appears that I might be able to get a used one for free.</p><p>Looking at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl500w">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl500w</a> this seems to support the latest versions of OpenWRT (although I have yet to find out how to get the proprietary broadcom driver..). Do I need to build my own image to get bluetooth working with OpenWRT?</p><p>Having 2 USB ports is a great advantage as well: Since I intend to use 1 USB port already for an A-Link USB Bluetooth 2.1 dongle, I can use the other port to connect an external storage drive or perhaps a 3G dongle too.</p><p>Does this sound possible? :-)</p>									</div>
