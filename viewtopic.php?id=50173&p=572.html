					<p>tapper,</p><p>I looked into DFS and cpuidle before. However, returning from deep idle state caused the kernel to panic. The issue is the drivers weren&#039;t written with hardware coherency in mind. So it&#039;s either using software coherency or rewriting drivers of which both suck. That&#039;s were I left things rest.</p><p>Then there is also the question of added latency (switching power states is usually really costly) and how efficient this power saving mechanism actually are for this boards before giving a recommendation. Expecting the same results as with a standard Intel desktop might be very far from the truth but unless people play with such things we wont know.</p>									</div>

					<p>@JW0914<br />@sera<br />I solved the problem of temperature rise. On the Board remained rudiment of the mamba is a location to install the fan connector and power control key (MOSFET). In these places, I installed the necessary elements. It turned out that the fan control circuit is connected to the mpp18 processor. Applied patch PWM-FAN from the mamba.<br />Now, compile the kernel at wrt3200, the temperature does not exceed 75°C.<br /><a href="https://github.com/Chadster766/McDebian/issues/24#issuecomment-290790365">https://github.com/Chadster766/McDebian … -290790365</a></p>									</div>

					<p>ValCher,</p><p>thanks for the link and pictures. You even cut out a space for the fan, nicely done. A few notes.</p><p>1) The PWM-FAN patches can&#039;t possibly have an effect. The armada-385 doesn&#039;t have the required blink registers. Only armada 370 and xp have those. To use the pwm-fan driver for mamba you&#039;d have to edit armada-38x.dtsi as well, and if you do you should see a kernel panic.</p><p>You are using your fan as a gpio-fan and the binding should look along the lines of:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>gpio-fan {
        compatible = &quot;gpio-fan&quot;;
        gpios = &lt;&amp;gpio0 18 0&gt;;
        gpio-fan,speed-map = &lt;0 0&gt;,
                             &lt;4500 1&gt;;
};</code></pre></div><br /><p>2) mvsw61xx vs swconfig node. The former is the one used in OpenWrt, as you noticed the DTC complains. Fixing this requires changes to swconfig core. As it happens the switches on our devices to not use indirect addressing and so just dropping the &quot;reg&quot; property works as a workaround. I used swconfig for the node name but switch@72004 or such would be even better. Either way mvsw61xx is clearly against conventions. There is no functional impact due to this change. The whole thing behaves exactly the same as the original bindings except for the DTC warning being gone.</p><p>3) tlc59116 vs pca9635. Those are different chips with separate drivers. They serve the same purpose and the drivers seem compatible enough according to your testing. However this is not how it&#039;s supposed to be handled at all. I suggest to revert this change.</p><p>4) You add an &quot;usb_power&quot; property to the usb nodes, don&#039;t know how you ended up with this, but it will just silently be ignored.</p>									</div>

					<p>@sera<br />Thank you very much for explaining and supplement, especially for valuable clarification on agenda item 2, and in future I shall.</p><br /><p>About PWM-FAN, Yes, I have added the appropriate lines to armada-38x.dtsi, but because my hwmod in a single copy, I did not publish that would not enter anyone astray.</p><p>I agree with you tlc59116, I wrote installed chip markings, functionally they are the same.</p><p>Thanks for the comments on paragraph 4, with this I&#039;ll tackle next.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>@ValCher</strong> Out of curiosity, is your 3200 placed in an area with poor ventilation?&nbsp; Even under intense load, provided it&#039;s getting a minute amount of passive air flow at 2 - 3 CFM, and provided the ambient air temp is within the mid 70F [~24C] range, it shouldn&#039;t be overheating.&nbsp; It could be you&#039;re limited in areas it could be placed within, however if you are able to move it, that should resolve the issue without the need for a fan.&nbsp; (Then again, I&#039;m a bit biased and prefer passively cooled equipment whenever possible =])</p>									</div>

					<p>@JW0914<br />Router installed indoors on the Bookshelf with a height of 2 meters, ceiling even 1 meter. Room temperature not exceeding 23° c.<br />On the router, the processor temperature rises when improper use it, namely when you compile the kernel and modules. This is a very big load on the processor. If you use a router on its purpose, the processor temperature is 80 ... 85° c.<br />In addition to installing the fan, I have replaced the thermal pads on copper plates. All this greatly increased the degree of cooling.<br />Before modernization, temperature when compiling reaches 100° c.<br />After upgrading (without fan), the temperature of the processor does not exceed 93° c. When using the mechanical ventilation, the temperature does not exceed 75° c.<br />I did not encourage conduct similar upgrades, because when you use the device for its intended purpose, head cooling system fully cope with the heat.<br />A little off topic.<br />WRT1900ACv1 vs WRT3200ACM-Time compile the kernel and modules.<br />WRT1900ACv1 - 1:30<br />WRT3200ACM -&nbsp; 0:40<br />What a performance!</p>									</div>
