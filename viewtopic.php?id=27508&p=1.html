					<p>Correct, if your ISP does not provide native IPv6, you won&#039;t get connectivity just by installing kmod-ipv6. You need some kind of tunneling mechanism.<br />There are two &quot;big&quot; approaches:<br />&nbsp; - 6to4 which works basically everywhere with any provider<br />&nbsp; - 6in4 which requires a tunnelbroker, for example he.net or sixxs</p><p>I suggested 6to4 since it requires no broker and is completely autoconfigured.<br />For 6in4 you need to sign up with a broker, request a tunnel and a subnet and then configure a local 6in4 interface with the credentials they provided you with.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t think of a good reason to have both a ULA and a global address on the same interface...perhaps if you had a very large private network that you didn&#039;t want to expose to the public Internet.</p><p>I think what you want is the interface&#039;s link-local address. They&#039;re automatically configured (using Neighborhood Discovery, no need for radvd configuration), and they&#039;re non-routable, so they should never go off-site.</p><p>And of course, the best way to make sure your LAN traffic stays within the LAN is to configure your firewall to filter out any traffic that you haven&#039;t specifically approved, i.e. &quot;default deny.&quot; I haven&#039;t figured out how to get UCI to implement a default deny policy for IPv6, so I&#039;ve resorted to /etc/firewall.user</p>									</div>

If you for example do not bridge your wired and wireless, you have two links.<br />IETF even have ULA capabilities as a requirement for basic home routers (RFC 6204).</p>									</div>
