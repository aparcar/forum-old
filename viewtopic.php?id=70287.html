					<p>I have a Pirelli Aga, similar hardware. Installed openwrt 12.09 and configured as client with relay pseudobridge. <br />No AP function. If try to enable a virtual AP for repeating, wireless stops working.<br />Insufficient resources and broadcom driver problem together.<br />If you delete the ap section it work.

					<p>Hi mh3g, I have configured everything without issues till step 8 of guide &quot;Routed Client with relayd (Pseudobridge)&quot; where it says I can enable the (Wireless Bridged Repeater) Router as a WiFi AP if it is multi-SSID capable.</p><p>I haven&#039;t tried to use it with the WiFi AP function (step 8) disabled because I strictly need such function but I guess it should work without problem, i.e., connect laptops/etc. via LAN to the (Wireless Bridged Repeater) Router, which then connects via WiFi to the main Router.</p>									</div>
