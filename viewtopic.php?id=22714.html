Feel free to do so <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />The &#039;uImage&#039;-file is the firmware image. You can also download the GPL-source from netgear. But don&#039;t expect too much..</p><p>Anyway, if you plan on flashing anything, be sure to have a serial cable installed, and try not to kill the bootloader.
