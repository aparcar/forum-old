					<p>You can try to set up a &quot;complete&quot; environment via NFS. I mean for example the gentoo&#039;s embedded stage 3 that you can find here :</p><p><a href="http://ftp.belnet.be/packages/gentoo/experimental/mips/embedded/stages/stage3-mipsel-uclibc-20041107.tar.bz2">http://ftp.belnet.be/packages/gentoo/ex â€¦ 07.tar.bz2</a></p><p>Then, you can chroot /bin/sh to your new environment, but take into account the fact that the busybox binary needs some libs both on the wrt and the chrooted env to work fine. It worked fine for me, even if gbd is really slow then <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
