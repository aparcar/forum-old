					<p>Update:</p><p>Small (bug?) issue in Kamikaze 7674, you need to specify the broadcast address when configuring IP space that does not consume the entire block. 10.x.x.x and 172.16.x.x are effected but 192.168.x.x does not look to be (at least it always has the correct broadcast for 192.168.x.x)</p><p>Running Wireshark on the PC&#039;s on the LAN ports of R2 and R3 show that packets are not leaving the routers.</p>									</div>
