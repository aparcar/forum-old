					<p>I`m a newbie (both linux and openwrt). I have a few questions:</p><p>++ I learned that i can access the serial console of the router after openwrt boots up. The question is, how do i access it through a web page ?</p><p>My requirement is that i should be able to use wireless internet from this device (coming to it through a LAN, as usual) , and also I should be able to communicate with the fellow devices [say, some kinda microcontroller] connected through the UART in the WRT54GL via the SAME internet connection.</p><p>First i want to know if this is possible at all. Could anybody please comment on this ?</p>									</div>

					<p>To control your routers features through a web page, you need to write a program to run on the router in cgi, php or maybe even lua/luci. So far, I have just some experience in php, but since php and lua/luci run on top of cgi in openwrt. You probably want to run local programs and manipulate files - both should be done by luci, so you may find helpful information in that source code.</p>									</div>
