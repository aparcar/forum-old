					<p>I own Pentagram Cerberus P 6311-07A router, which is probably some branding-job of polish Pentagram company.</p><p>I&#039;ve opened it and checked it&#039;s components:</p><p><strong>CPU:</strong> Trendchip TC3162L2 / TC3085<br /><strong>ADSL:</strong> Trendchip TC3162L2 / TC3085<br /><strong>SWITCH:</strong> IC+ IP175C<br /><strong>RAM:</strong> HY57V641620FTP-H (64Mb = 8MB, 133MHz)<br /><strong>FLASH:</strong> MX29LV160CBTC-70G (16Mb = 2MB)</p><p>I&#039;ve found following documentation for that elements:<br /><a href="http://www.trendchip.com.tw/bridge.html">http://www.trendchip.com.tw/bridge.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.icplus.com.tw/pp-IP175C.html">http://www.icplus.com.tw/pp-IP175C.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.hynix.com/inc/pdfDownload.jsp?path=/datasheet/pdf/consumer/HY57V641620F(L_S)TP_series(Rev1.0).pdf">http://www.hynix.com/inc/pdfDownload.js … ev1.0).pdf</a></p><p>I don&#039;t really understand that TC3162L2 / TC3085.

					<p>I Googled for this Pentagram router and found info this can have the same hardware as some TP-LINK. I found two similar TP-LINK models (no wifi, 4 ethernet ports, ADSL, USB): TD-8841 and TD-8841T. Comparing specifications of these models I found out my Pentagram is clone of TD-8841T (T stands for TrendChip).</p><p>Then I compared firmwares from TP-LINK site (for both models) using &quot;strings&quot; console application:</p><p>1) TD-8841&#039;s firmware contains some Linux-like strings: /var/log/logA, /var/udhcpd/udhcpd.conf1, /var/passwd!, netfilter, 2.6.8.1, ld-uClibc.so.0 and so on. You can even find source of firmware on <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/support/gpl.asp">http://www.tp-link.com/support/gpl.asp</a></p><p>2) TD-8841T&#039;s firmware doesn&#039;t contain such strings, and doesn&#039;t have firmware on <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/support/gpl.asp">http://www.tp-link.com/support/gpl.asp</a> . So I belive it&#039;s not using Linux unfortunately. </p><p>Still I don&#039;t have any idea what architecture this Pentagram/TD-8841T is based on. And if this architecture is supported by Linux.</p>									</div>

You are better off to get a router with more RAM if you want to run any open-source firmware.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thank you for reply! I don&#039;t expect much from this router. It&#039;s more about learning hardware, OpenWrt, supporting not-yet-supported devices, finding serial myself, experimenting with USB, LEDs, failsafe mode and so on... Generally it&#039;s more for my fun that real needs.</p><p>For my real routing job I&#039;ve bought Linksys WRT160NL, but that&#039;s another topic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Using telnet I connected to this router and noticed it&#039;s interface is ZynOS&#039;s interface. So this *can* be adm5120eb as it&#039;s platform supported by ZynOS. But maybe ZynOS can also run on other platforms and my router is one of these? Not sure who could I ask for this except you guys <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/neutral.png" width="15" height="15" alt="neutral" /></p>									</div>
