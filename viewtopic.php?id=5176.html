					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;d like to build my own image with some tweaks, but first, I want to start with some known-good configuration, if possible the same one as used for official released images. Are these config files (at least for Asus WL500GD, &quot;bin&quot; subtype) available somewhere? I hope I&#039;m not overlooking something obvious 8)</p><p>thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for answer, but I&#039;m not sure I expressed myself clearly: DEVELOPER=1 apparently enables extra settings in the menuconfig. Instead, I&#039;d like to see .config files used in official RC5 brcm bin and micro images, so I could check out what packages and kernel options they use and then tune them for my own image.</p>									</div>

What I want to know is exactly what packages and what kernel options are used in each of the released firmware images. I assume that developer in charge of releases has some .config-bin, .config-pptp and .config-micro files, which he uses to build each flavour. Is that correct? I&#039;d like to see these files...</p>									</div>

					<p>You still don&#039;t understand it and you seem unwilling to actually look into it, so let me spell it out for you in detail -</p><p>If you take a fresh checkout of the sources, nothing built and no config files and then run &quot;make menuconfig DEVELOPER=1&quot; you&#039;ll get a menuconfig screen with nearly every single package enabled. Exit and save this configuration, this will produce a .config file -- this config file specifies how and what to compile, this is the only config file ever used. Running &quot;make&quot; will then compile all the packages and produce a bin/packages directory; this directory is then uploaded as the ipkg repository, ex: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/packages/</a></p><p>This will also produce a few other items, a firmware image (completely ignored), an SDK (contains the compiler and some basic framework; uploaded) and something called ImageBuilder. At no point will we ever go back and change our .config file or recompile anything; the packages are already built and it&#039;s simply a matter of transforming those packages into a firmware image -- this is what ImageBuilder does.</p><p>ImageBuilder is completely incapable of building/compiling/modifying any packages or kernel options, it&#039;s basically an overgrown version of ipkg. There is absolutely zero configuration required to use ImageBuilder; the list of which packages get added to which firmwares is built into ImageBuilder itself (look under the lists/ directory). The job of ImageBuilder is to simply to extract a set of packages a set of packages into a temporary directory representing /, convert that directory into a filesystem image, then to take that filesystem, add a kernel and produce a trx file. It does this for each filesystem (squashfs, jffs-4M, jffs-8M) in each list (default, micro, pptp). Headers are then added to the trx files to produce bin files, a &quot;openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&quot; becomes several different &quot;openwrt-&lt;model&gt;-squashfs.bin&quot; files. When all the default/micro/pptp directories are filled with a confusing number of trx and bin files, the entire mess is then uploaded to the openwrt.org servers.</p><p>A 00-README is &quot;written&quot; using an excessive amount of cutting and pasting from the previous 00-README and the wiki, and a release announcement is made.</p><p>---</p><p>Note: This is completely excessive for building just a single image for personal use; the defaults in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; will work perfectly fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, that&#039;s the answer I was looking for.</p><p>I&#039;m sorry that you feel any unwillingnes on my part. I just misunderstood your build process, thats all.</p><p>Again, thanks for an in-depth and helpful answer.</p>									</div>
