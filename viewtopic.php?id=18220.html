					<p>I would like to record sound using a microphone and a USB sound card to a .wav format file using OpenWRT (running on an Asus 520gu). So far, I&#039;ve heard that sox should be able to do this, and I&#039;m looking for other alternatives. The reason I&#039;d like to find something other than sox is because I&#039;m having trouble getting it to run, and even if I could get it to run it would take up a lot of space on the device (~5MB).</p><p>Elsewhere in this forum I saw a mention of the program called &quot;rawrec&quot; being used with OpenWRT about 2 years ago. But when I try to install it with opkg (using openwrt.org&#039;s packages) I get this behavior:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install rawrec<br />Killed</p><br /><p>Is there something else I can try? Preferably lightweight, with flexibility to record at different sampling rates and bits/sample?</p><p>thanks!<br />Dan</p>									</div>
