					<p>I have 2 FON La Fonera and 2 other Accton boxes all with Atheros AR2315 chipsets and I am experiencing very weird issues on all of them.</p><p>With a vanilla openwrt (tried 7.09 and bleeding edge svn from last night), only sometimes (intermittent issue) my Macbook Pro and another Dell laptop can connect to the AP, but get disconnected/reconnected/disconnected/reconnected every ~ 3-4 seconds.</p><p>Not long enough to be totally disassociated, so on the macbook pro I can keep surfing and it&#039;s just &quot;very slow&quot;. On XP it eventually switches to another router if I have reachable nodes set to &quot;Automatically&quot; join.</p><p>When it happens, I do &quot;wlanconfig ath0 list&quot; to see who&#039;s associated, and I see the laptop getting connected/disconnected all the time. Nothing in the logs.</p><p>Playing with different settings with iwpriv (or setting the rate to something else) seems to help stabilize things for a couple of minutes, but it fails again later.</p><p>The same laptops have no problems connecting to WRT54G&#039;s with the same firmware.</p><p>Has anybody experienced this issue?</p>									</div>
