					<p>Hi all,<br />hi have a little problem.</p><p>I created a series of scripts that determine whether the device has its eth0 connected to a functioning network (Gateway) or not (Client) and in according to the result configure /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless via uci command. This script start at S20 of my init.d but I realized that when my device restart and switch from Gateway to Client (during tests) and viceversa for a strange reason my /var/state/network have something about previous configuration. This problem is verified only once when i change the role of my device from client to gateway and viceversa.<br />I think that the problem is caused by hotplug because it is called before of my script.</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p><p>Rgds</p>									</div>
