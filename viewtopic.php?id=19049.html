					<p>As for my Asus W500GL-P the firmware upgrade (from 8.09 RC2 to 8.09 final) via LuCI worked very well, even with preserving my existing configuration.</p><p>On the other hand this highly appreciated feature led to minor problems on another edge: when re-installing additional packages via LuCI the opkg stuck without any feedback to the user. This occured when it hit existing configurations waiting for user interaction. This can be circumvented by installing packages from the command line becoming able to interact with opkg.</p>									</div>

					<p>In reply to my original post, no it is not yet available for the Pronghorn Metro platform. Unable to test the other Pronghorn boards, as I do not have access to them.</p>									</div>
