					<p>Ok, this is right about where the skriptkiddie stuff Ill be doing may not be as useful to other people, so its a good time to share what I have done.</p><p>First off, for compatibility&#039; sake, I have a <strong>TP-Link TL-WR703N</strong>, which means this will be a breeze if you have one of those!</p><p>The changes Ive made are lengthy. I&#039;ll try to keep track of everything and if I suddenly remember stuff I&#039;ll come back and post it here.</p><p>In a jiff, this is what this (collection of) script[s] will do:<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Scan for networks<br/>2. Compose a list, automatically ignoring all encrypted nets<br/>3. Check remaining nets against a filter list<br/>4. Connect to strongest network<br/>5. Verify connectivity with a ping of arbitrary site (set to google.com)<br/>----<br/>6. Create a new wireless network called &quot;Ghost&quot;<br/>7. Relay all dhcp requests and other traffic invisibly to host network from step 5<br/>8. Do a bunch of convoluted shite to create an accessible node with sshd access in same ip range<br/>9. Continue monitoring and if connectivity is lost, start again.<br/>10. Make a sandwich. &lt;----currently broken.<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>ZIP FILE:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2sj-gwM78hSTJjOFhUQmh4STQ/edit?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2sj- â€¦ sp=sharing</a></p><br/><br/><br/><p>INSTALL NOTES:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#install directions
#create folder /jffs/bin/ (mkdir /jffs/bin)
#copy everything but ETCCONFIG folder there (cp * /jffs/bin)
#chmod a+x the whole lot (chmod a+x /jffs/bin/*)
#cd into ETCCONFIG 
#copy everything there to /etc/config (cp * /etc/config)
#make sure wireless-tools and relayd is installed (opkg update; opkg install relayd; opkg install wireless-tools)
#run script by ./autoap.sh


#once satisfied, to have it run at every boot, 
#add &quot;/jffs/bin/autoap.sh &gt;&gt; /tmp/autoap.output &amp;&quot; to /etc/inittab</code></pre></div><p>NOTE: the file locations are hardcoded. if this stuff isnt in /jffs/bin/ it wont work.</p>									</div>

					<p>So...for Holy Shit&#039; sake, I could try to list the bajillions of changes from the DD-WRT copy, but its been over a month of daily hackage and I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d be able to. </p><p>I use it to have (nearly) constant wifi AP in my vehicle.</p><p>I would be thrilled if this proves &#039;useful&#039; to others and maybe we get some collaborative scripting going on. </p><p>SO: Please share any upgrayeds you make!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, thanks for this port.</p><p>Most of the Wifis that I found when travel are those support 802.1X Port Authentication,when you can connect,but need to log on with your mobile phone and get a txt back for a code to finally connect to internet.</p><p>Directly open wifi these days are rare,if there are,there are most phishing with &quot;cains&quot; behind to scan any your passcode....not dare to connect to those &quot;free&quot; wifi these days.</p><p>If you can change with auto logon with 802.1x authentication,it would be better.</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>									</div>

					<p>uh, you must not understand how Cain works, or have your entire networking configuration set to blindly accept new security certs. It&#039;s a shitty, very obvious MITM, and the rest of the info it can glean anybody with a packet sniffer could see anyway. </p><p>Aside from that, 802.1x Auth would still be awesome. Lots of other things too like auto login to common free portals, maybe making it work hand in hand with a proxy server setup.. </p><p>I&#039;ll be definitely doing more and hope it turns out some others do too.</p>									</div>
