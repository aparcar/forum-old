					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I installed Kirkwood Viper with Luci on my Linksys EA4500 and additionally setup a guest wifi, using the documentation (for Luci users) in the openwrt wiki.</p><p>Except the WPA2-PSK security settings, changing the Wifi name and disabling WMM, I made no configs, but the Wifi is not that fast. When I run a speed test, I only have 11 to 14 MBit. I enabled 2.4 and 5 Ghz wifi.</p><p>Even if I sit next to the router, it&#039;s not much faster. The only difference is, that Windows shows all five bars for the network and not, as in the living room, only three. Using my iPhone 6s, it always loses connection and even doesn&#039;t find it anymore.</p><p>Do you have any hints, how I can &quot;tune&quot; my wifi?</p><p>Thanks and kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your response. It was enabled, until I googled, what can be the cause for the slow wifi and found this as one possible solution. Then I disabled it.</p><p>This may not be the reason for it.</p>									</div>

					<p>if you disable WMM, you cant hit more what 802.11g speeds (54Mbps), so enable WMM. WMM is a part of 802.11n and newer standarts.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, I see. Thanks for that description. At the moment, I guess none of my devices supports more than 54 Mbit, but hopefully in the future. I&#039;ll reactivate it - it had no influence at all.</p><p>Any other ideas, where the slow wifi may come from? I changed /etc/config/wireless and adjusted both, 2.4 and 5 Ghz to be located in country &quot;US&quot; and use tx_power(?) to 27 dBm. As far as I read, this should lead to an increased coverage in compare to the default or the german config?!</p><p>Thanks and kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah. Thanks a lot! Now both, smartphone and laptop, reach the 33, 34 Mbit, running a speedtest. That&#039;s great!
