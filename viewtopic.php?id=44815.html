					<p>Interestingly, I am using the Logitech C170 camera with a TL MR3020 and one webcam works great, but when I added a second C170 through a powered USB hub, the second C170 would not work at all using MJPG. I got the &quot;&quot;No space left on device (-28) &quot; error as well. Each C170 connected individually would work fine. I then tried one C170 with a Pro 9000 and success! Both worked fine. I also tried one C170 with a Microsoft Lifecam, and that worked as well. Evidently there is something preventing two C170&#039;s working together at once. So anyone having issues with connecting two webcams of the same model number may want to try mixing the models and see if they get a better outcome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hasso</strong> on 12 Sep 2013, 07:41)</p>

					<p>Ah, well, the C270 is listed there with just a checkmark... no comment on the bandwidth requirements as for the MS Lifecam Cinema + Studio... so you can&#039;t completely rely on this list. But it seems to be a good start.</p>									</div>
