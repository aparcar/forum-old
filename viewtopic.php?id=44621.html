					<p>This may be a simple question to some, but I can&#039;t figure it out by myself:</p><p>I have a TP-Link wr741ND with the latest version of OpenWRT. It is connected to a router supplied by my ISP.</p><p>When I plug in the cable from the ISP router to the wan port, OpenWrt creates its own LAN and puts all the computers connected to it in that network, as it should. The problem with that configuration is that I can&#039;t share files between the computers connected to the OpenWRT and the ISP router, because the ISP router creates its own LAN.</p><p>What I want to do is somehow configure OpenWRT so that all computers connected to its LAN ports are on the same network as the WAN port, and the OpenWRT router is stil accessible on its own IP adress.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried messing with the DHCP server and VLANs, but the only thing I&#039;ve managed to do is to make the OpenWrt router invisible, as if it were a switch.</p><p>Any help? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You need the physical &quot;WAN&quot; interface in the br-lan bridge, you can forward dns to ISP modem/router and make sure you do not have DHCP Authoritative set. Can&#039;t remember if DHCP needs be disabled on the br-lan, or not.... Can set br-lan as DHCP but that makes knowing the IP of Luci interface an issue. Something like that.....&nbsp; Know how to reset....</p>									</div>
