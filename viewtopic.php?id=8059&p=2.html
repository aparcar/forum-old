					<p>The orignal Netgear Firmware has to be flashed in two parts (check the Wiki page). Anyway all my NVRAM variables got &quot;unset&quot; an set-ting them again, would coz them to be temporary(wouldnot survive reboot), thus the LAN card of the Router wouldnot work. Called Netgear, they said I will get a replacement as it&#039;s DOA (Dead On Arrival). </p><p>I bought it on the 14th. I think maybe something was messed up with the flash of the router, thats why it took more than an hour. </p><p>Also, can I have your base image. I just need W-LAN/VLAN(Internet Port)/USB support. PPPOE etc is not required. I dont want to boot from USB. I would rather have a minimal fast base package, with a few extra packages installed. My ISP has a always-on LAN connection, so dont need anything fancy there either.</p>									</div>

					<p>Got my new router. Whee. </p><p>Please, MMCM, can you forward me your base images? I just dont wanna brick it this time round. Also can I work on the inbuilt(default netgear) linux firmware? The login (admin:admin) doesnot work, so cant try.</p><p>This is something different, last time, I updated to 1.4.1.13 and I could not use the &quot;Installing SSH Daemon while keeping original Firmware&quot; guide here <a href="http://sarwiki.informatik.hu-berlin.de/Hacking_the_Netgear_wgt634u">http://sarwiki.informatik.hu-berlin.de/ … ar_wgt634u</a></p><p>Now it works, but server is down. Anyway gonna mess around a bit with this way, before attempt to flash.</p><p>--EDIT--</p><p>I was reading up on the orignal WGT634U thread, now I saw something about FTP. But I cant login, I tried modifying the proftpd.conf file, but nope. I basically wanna put ctorrent on it, preferably without flashing. BTW, how come wget doesnot work, any alternatives. </p><p>I logged in through the CFE using root and password.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nitant</strong> on 20 Nov 2006, 18:10)</p>

					<p>After messing with the router a lot. Really, I have decided to throw caution to the wind and made my own openWRT image. Used this a&nbsp; guide<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=31794">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=31794</a></p><p>I selected more or less default config, removed support for PPPoE, extra wireless drivers(Cisco etc), extra USB support(Prolific, Belkin, etc). Left mostly other stuff to default. Also the architecture i selected as BCM953xx 2.6, as thats the CPU the WGT has, and you said 2.6 is the way to go.</p><p>Anyway Image is building. Now should I flash squashfs or jjfs2. I read that generally jjfs2 is better. Also I flash using the commands on the Wiki right? Any other pointers etc for me?? I wont flash till tomm so will wait if neone has replied till then.</p>									</div>

					<p>How has it all worked out with torrent downloading?? Also have the WGT634U, and was thinking about doing something fun with it... Does the torrent client support RSS-feeds from trackers? Otherwise I might go with this instead: <a href="http://www.procare.com.tw/idd35.asp?prod_id=137">http://www.procare.com.tw/idd35.asp?prod_id=137</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes it worked. Torrent Downloads and everything. For best results, make sure to have a swap file. Though my WGT634U is dead (lightning), and now I am on the journey to downloading with a WRTSL54GS</p>									</div>
