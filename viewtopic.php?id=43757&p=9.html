					<p>Hi!</p><p>Thanks to slboat&#039;s nice offer on ebay I have a modded mr10u (&quot;mr10n&quot;) now.</p><p>It came with 16MB flash, 64MB ram, OpenWrt and worked great. And it was in English (have seen some older posts that talked about chinese UI).</p><p>It worked until I found that I can&#039;t install addtl. packages due to some version mismatch and decided to flash my own OpenWrt build (made with packagebuilder, after modding it for 16MB flash). I wanted usb storage support and to play with some other packages.</p><p>(BTW, slboat: I had to modify the URL where it gets the packages from, because the one in there didn&#039;t have a Packages file)</p><p>But somehow it didn&#039;t end well, I now just get a extreme primitive &quot;Failsafe UI&quot; (likely from the bootloader) with a file select and submit button.</p><p>It does not even say what one is seeing (like &quot;u.boot vX.X&quot; or so?) nor what exactly one should upload there... (like which image, which file format), but I tried with original firmware file from tplink china, with openwrt factory image, with pepe2k&#039;s uboot image, with self-made 16MB openwrt image.</p><p>No firmware image worked, it didn&#039;t even complete the upload, just hang there with &quot;sending request&quot; forever.</p><p>With u-boot (likely due to its much smaller size), it at least completed and told it is flashing/rebooting now, but of course that didn&#039;t work either - likely it does not flash the bootloader from that failsafe UI (web), but just the main firmware. But as I said: it leaves the user rather unclear about the possibilities.</p><p>I did a trace with wireshark and saw that the upload was going extremely slow. dup and retransmissions on tcp level.</p><p>So, my questions:</p><p>That bootloader seems a bit unhelpful and the failsafe web UI of it doesn&#039;t work for me - what I read about pepe2k&#039;s modded u-boot sounded much better. slboat, why didn&#039;t you flash that? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>And what precisely do I have there on this mr10n, is it a unmodified u-boot?</p><p>Does it offer anything else than the (non-working) http upload and working with a serial console (that I have to solder first and find a 2.5mm socket for my cable - but this is not really a comfortable nor quick option for non-electronics people)?</p><p>Or is there some trick to get http upload working?</p><p>From old times with wrt54, I am somehow used to devices that just accept their firmware via tftp at bootloader time (so the only thing one needs is a pc with a tftp client). No soldering necessary...</p><p>Other than this little problem, the device seems really nice. Charging takes rather long, but maybe discharging will then also take long. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>I solved it, after soldering a serial console cable into the device...</p><p>Observations:</p><p>It did not boot because:<br />&quot;Uncompressing Kernel Image ... Too big uncompressed streamLZMA ERROR 1&quot;</p><p>I tried again transferring/flashing some images, this time using u-boot&#039;s tftpboot command (u-boot modified by slboat).</p><p>The tftpboot of this u-boot version had major issues, often it gave up due to too many retries. But after many tries, I succeeded transferring and flashing an image (piratebox iirc) that didn&#039;t have these issues and booted successfully.</p><p>I also flashed pepe2k&#039;s improved u-boot - which has a much nicer UI and there even the web-based flashing works. Seems somehow much more reliable / comfortable than the less modded u-boot. Thanks pepe2k!</p>									</div>

					<p>Then you need to setup your internet connection first. As you probably want to keep those network settings for later, it would be best to use UCI for that purpose.

					<p>Hi guys !</p><p>I&#039;ve just received my new MR10U and proceeded to flash it using the web interface.</p><p>After it got to 100%, the page waited until timeout. I then assumed that it was successfuly flashed and i could reboot the router.</p><p>The router doesn&#039;t show up on regular telnet. It doesn&#039;t even has an IP address. But curiously i can still telnet him on failsafe mode. <br />I tried many times to reinstall the image using the indirect netcat method ( downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr10u-v1-squashfs-factory.bin ) without any success, but without loosing failsafe access either. </p><p>Are there any other images or checksums i can try, or any ideas of where i may be failing ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello All,</p><p>In the past I have compiled a custom build for WR703N based on AA 12.09 that contained all needed stuff for 3G, USB storage and serial support + openvpn and some other useful features enabled in busybox - all in the image for the stock 4MB device flash.</p><p>I would like to do the same for MR10U. However it is officially supported since BB 14.07 where this setup cannot be build in a 4MB image layout. </p><p>Having in mind that MR10U is very similar in HW to MR11U (which is officially supported by AA), can I use MR11U profile in AA buildroot as a base for my image and flash it on MR10U after that.</p><p>Any ideas whether it is possible or it is likely to brick the MR10U box.</p>									</div>
