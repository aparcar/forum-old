					<p>Hi,</p><p>i would like to play music using OpenWRT and WR703N (might change that to better router or something like Raspberry Pi).</p><p>I&#039;m looking for solutions to two different problems:<br />a) stream music from computer (doesn&#039;t matter if it directly streams mp3 files or the actual music that&#039;s playing) - would like to use this with Rhythmbox or similar player.</p><p>b) play music from network storage (samba or http) and be able to control it using laptop and smartphone</p><p>I&#039;m looking for different ideas on how to achieve this, e.g. which applications already exist, what protocol is the best, ... I do know my way around programming (C/C++, Python), so I won&#039;t mind partial or not finished projects.</p><p>Edit: I would also like to know what reasonably priced USB sound card would be the best for openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>deanrock</strong> on 6 Jul 2013, 16:18)</p>
