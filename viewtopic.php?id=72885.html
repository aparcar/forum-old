					<p>so rule is:<br />one radio can broadcast any SSID via one (same) channel?<br />that device has 2.4 ghz and two SSID configured. it&#039;s only one way force second SSID to use different chanel is agregate it with another radio interface or move second SSID to 5.4 ghz?</p><p>Is it correct assuption?</p>									</div>

					<p>One radio can only tune into a single channel at a time.<br />Some wireless chipsets can create multiple AP interfaces (with different SSIDs) on the same channel, this is usually limited to around 4-8 at most.<br />These days most of the better routers come with two radios, one exclusively for 2.4 GHz, the other exclusively for 5 GHz.<br />The market is slowly seeing some highend devices with three radios, one in the 2.4 GHz band, two in the 5 GHz band to aid with meshing or repeating (or to divide the large 5 GHz band into a low (non-DFS sub-band and DFS based high sub-band with a much larger bandwidth).</p>									</div>

					<p>It is correct that some chipset manufacturers are experimenting with multi-channel operations (partially as a side effect of large bandwidth channels), but those efforts seem to have stalled (or are simply too difficult/ expensive for the market).<br />None of these have left laboratories or reached the enduser market so far.</p>									</div>
