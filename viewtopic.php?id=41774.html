					<p>Hi Forum!</p><p>Again i need the Knowledgebase of the great ones here.<br />When im going to add Kernelmodules to my openwrtbox i do the following.<br />I atach the Device i need to a ubuntu machine wich has the same kernelversion.<br />Them i make a diff between lsmod $withdevice and a lsmod $without device.</p><p>Ok Sir now i know, that i need tveeprom.ko for example.<br />After that i went to my build dir and:</p><p>find . | grep tveeprom<br />linux-3.3.8/drivers/media/video/tveeprom.c</p><p>And yes, there it is. Now i take a look at linux-3.3.8/drivers/media/video/Kconfig, which tells me:<br />config VIDEO_TVEEPROM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; tristate<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; depends on I2C</p><p>This is what i use for the $.mk in package/kernel/modules:<br />CONFIG_VIDEO_TVEEPROM</p><p>Sometimes that works ($.ko) there in $build_dir/linux-blah-elsewhere. <br />Where i can pick it up later in $.mk file usinf &#039;FILES:=&#039;.<br />And sometimes its not there. <br />What is the best method to findout which CONFIG(s) i have to call?</p><p>I am pretty sure that i use &quot;the bad&quot; method, as usual <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Regards<br />derdigge</p>									</div>
