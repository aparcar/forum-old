					<p>I&#039;m trying to run openwrt with netem on a D-Link DIR-601 A1. I&#039;ve managed to install 10.03.01, but I believe that does not have netem support. Snapshot certainly seems to have netem support, but I couldn&#039;t find the dir-600 image, only the dir-825.</p><p>I built from svn trunk, but my radio doesn&#039;t work (I probably borked the config, &#039;cause there is no gui either). Anyway, it occurs to me to post as I&#039;m guessing that the dir-600 image should be in the snapshots.</p><p>I _should_ be able to build it from svn trunk. I don&#039;t know what I didn&#039;t configure. I would guess my entire .config is not necessary. Any tips?</p>									</div>
