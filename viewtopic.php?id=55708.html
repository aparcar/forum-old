					<p>How would you go about blocking certain country TLDs in OpenWrt?</p><p>Let&#039;s assume, for security purposes, you wanted to block access to all Chinese (*.ch) domains and all Russian (*.ru) domains. Particularly for being more efficient in blocking malware, etc. Instead of adding individual .ru domains to a DNSmasq block list, I would think it could potentially be more efficient if I could tell OpenWrt to not resolve any .ru domains, for example.</p><p>Is there any relatively easy way to achieve this within the router with OpenWrt?</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

Unfortunately, it did not work at first, though, until I added a period before the TLD, like this &quot;server=/.ru/127.0.0.2&quot; and I also decided to go with &quot;address&quot; instead of &quot;server&quot; and everything is working great.</p><p>In case anyone else is curious how I followed through with blocking country TLD on DNS level I will share my code. This is in combination with another method of serving a 1x1 transparent pixel image to the browsers for adblocking.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>address=/.ru/192.168.1.1

But I sincerely don&#039;t mean anything negative from this and haven&#039;t actually narrowed it down to what actually suits my needs just yet.</p><p>Basically, I was trying to use some Hosts files and other DNS lists for the purpose of advertisement blocking as well as some privacy and malware stuff as well which are quite large lists. When I was going through them I realized that there were thousands of domains from Russia along with a bunch of other countries. So with the limited space I have with OpenWrt, I tried to think of a more efficient way to achieve this. I haven&#039;t had the time yet to figure out what should be blocked yet based on my geographic region or my Internet needs just yet though. Most of the TLDs I wasn&#039;t sure which country they represented and had to look on Wikipedia.</p>									</div>
