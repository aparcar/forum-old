					<p>Hello,<br />the OpenWRT firmware on these routers is developed directly by the manufacturer. Is not part of the OpenWRT here and as I see, there is not official support for this router at this moment. But maybe I miss.</p>									</div>

So I flashed a firmware and it is working fine, though I am not able to connect to internet as when I put my adsl cable to WAN port the router gives IP of adsl modem. When I remove it, the router gives its own IP but then there&#039;s no internet hence I cannot install luci or anything else via SSH...</p><p>what to do?</p>									</div>
