					<p>Another thing that&#039;s a bit buggy is the Atheros way of enforcing Regdomains. The EEPROM of my DIR-825&#039;s radio cards report them as being in the US regdomain. So when I use an unpatched Atheros driver I don&#039;t get all the channels I am supposed to get here in Germany (regdomain DE). However I do get some additional channels in the 5GHz Band which I shouldn&#039;t have because they may not be used over here. When I select &quot;Force Atheros drivers to respect the user&#039;s regdomain settings&quot; in menuconfig for kmod-ath hostapd tells me that the hardware doesn&#039;t support the channel I chose (that can be any channel). iw list shows all the channels as being active, iw reg get shows DE, and ifconfig wlan1 channel 40 works like a charm. Only hostapd can&#039;t bring the interface up. I hope to come back to you with some debugging output but right now there is christmas going on <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>So Merry Christmas to all of you!<br />ValXdater, I owe you a beer.</p>									</div>

Then I check the IP for WEBUI access, if not accessible, for some reason sometimes I have to add Luci-fastindex but I don&#039;t add it unless necessary. </p><p>Here&#039;s a list of my Luci packages that are currently installed (most were part of the snapshot): check for completeness with: OPKG list_installed | grep luci (search installed luci packages and complete list below with OPKG install where, if needed)<br />luci-admin-core<br />luci-admin-full<br />luci-app-firewall (optional but needed for configuration)<br />luci-app-qos (optional but may need for prioritising WAN traffic)<br />luci-cbi<br />luci-core<br />luci-http<br />luci-i18n-english<br />luci-ipkg<br />luci-lmo<br />luci-lucid<br />luci-nixio<br />luci-px5g<br />luci-sgi-cgi<br />luci-sys<br />luci-theme-base<br />luci-theme-openwrt<br />luci-uci<br />luci-uvl<br />luci-web (Note: may need Luci-fastindex also)</p><p>The TELNET works faster for install of packages and there&#039;s also the option to use OPKG install &lt;package name&gt; --noaction (to see if enough room is available. You can also use OPKG List | grep &lt;package xheader&gt;&nbsp; or search parameter to narrow search for packages and brief description is there too).</p><p>Don&#039;t forget to 30-30-30 second hard reset before and after flash. The newer trunks have an easy flash within Luci to upgrade f/w. </p><p>Even though the trunk snapshots are considered not yet stable, mine works well for wired-ETHERNET; wireless N is whole different issue and may be primary reason for their status. Check the forums for a WIP thread on your model to see if there are any issues are or pre-built f/w posted for sharing.</p><p>Sorry for lengthy post, but I thought you might need more clues since you&#039;re new to OpenWrt; I had to glean through several pages of multiple threads and ask noob questions myself before I was on track. Which wasn&#039;t that long ago! I also tried to answer all your &quot;what now ?&quot; questions.</p>									</div>

It seems that SPI bus is shared on RB433AH, and mmc-spi driver does not support sharing of SPI bus? Is there any other option for enabling SD card on ar71xx architecture using openWRT?</p><p>Please help...</p>									</div>
