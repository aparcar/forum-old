					<p>@david,</p><p>As you know I&#039;ve been running your builds for a very long time now, and never had an issue on my WRT1200AC V1.&nbsp; However, today I noticed this very odd entry in my log.&nbsp; However, after the log entries below, the router was still running without issue for over 2 hours until I happened to check to log and reboot it just to be on the safe side. No devices got disconnected, new devices were able to connect, everything was still working perfectly.&nbsp; I find the message near the top saying &quot;hostapd was not tainted&quot; to be interesting.</p><p>What is very odd is that the log entry occurred after the router had been up for almost 3 days.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t changed anything in those 3 days.&nbsp; This is on your latest build.&nbsp; </p><p>You can see at the very same second, before all the kernel warnings, a device disconnected.&nbsp; Nothing else is logged immediately before or after.&nbsp; So my guess would be the kernel warnings were initiated by hostapd, but afterwards hostapd continued to function normally (even before I rebooted it).&nbsp; Was it a one time thing that exposed a bug or glitch in the kernel that finally showed itself after hundreds of hours of running in total?&nbsp; That would be my guess.&nbsp; Do you have any insight you can add?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Wed Jun  7 08:10:29 2017 daemon.notice hostapd: wlan0: AP-STA-DISCONNECTED xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
