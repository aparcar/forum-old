					<p>I&#039;ve been through the ToH about a hundred times, but I can&#039;t make a decision on what OpenWRT capable router to purchase.&nbsp; I would like something with a USB port so I can attach network storage and 5gHz support would be nice, but definitely not necessary.&nbsp; I&#039;d also like the ability to configure VLANs.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read, the ar71xx-based routers seem to be the most popular.&nbsp; Some of the routers based on this chipset that seemed interesting were the Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH (I&#039;ve never owned a Buffalo product before), D-Link DIR-825 (the few D-Link routers I&#039;ve come into contact with have been complete garbage), Cisco WRT160NL (all of the Linksys/Cisco gear I have owned has worked flawlessly), and Netgear WNDR3700 (owned one router from Netgear and I never had a problem with it).&nbsp; Is there a consensus when it comes to which router is the most stable running OpenWRT?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read of some connectivity stability issues on the Buffalo, but I haven&#039;t read a whole lot about any wide-spread problems with any of the other devices.&nbsp; However, for some reason the Buffalo appeals to me the most.&nbsp; Other routers that aren&#039;t ar71xx-based that I was intrigued by were the Linksys WRTSL54GS and Asus WL-500g Premium.</p><p>Any input anyone could give me regarding any of these devices would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you for reading!</p>									</div>

					<p>The V2 needs a recent trunk build of OpenWRT. The V1 works fine with backfire 10.03. However, 5 GHz doesn&#039;t work in the default config, you need to set CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y prior to compile.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe GPIO could be for you also an aspect, whether the router has general purpose IO. It is good if you later want to use it for making robots. I bought long time ago an Asus wl 500gp, and now I would have a robot programming project and I couldn&#039;t use is unfortunately.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using a D-Link DIR-825 rev. B1. The stock firmware it came with was a mixed blessing at best, but with latest OpenWRT trunk it works like a charm. It has both 2,5GHz and 5GHz radios, a USB port and has removable external antennas (great for the DIY WISPs out there). Last time I checked, its price fell between that of the TP-Link WR1043ND and the WNDR3700.<br />It does run a little hotter than I&#039;m used to from my old Asus WL500gD, but that&#039;s probably due to the faster CPU and more powerful hardware. Also, if that&#039;s an issue to you, it does have a bunch of _very_ bright blue LEDs to light up the neighbourhood, but if you put it in a closet they won&#039;t bother you at night.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ack</strong> on 12 Mar 2011, 04:41)</p>

					<p>It depends on what you want.&nbsp; I chose the WL-500GP V2 because I needed internal IO (serial ports) and wanted to connect USB devices.&nbsp; I also wanted to be able to use it as a troubleshooting instrument that is small, lightweight, and cheap.&nbsp; I will be loading it with a bunch of specific devices: freq counter, logic analyzer, simple scope, RS-485 bus, and some other odds and ends.&nbsp; I will use it to diagnose and check the health of robots in the field.&nbsp; Just hook up&nbsp; web browser from a smart phone, laptop, or computer.</p><p>So, maybe you need to determine what you want to do with it, then grab something and make it work.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter until you refine your requirements.&nbsp; The ultimate does not exist for anything.&nbsp; It is a feature vs need trade off.&nbsp; I would rather use the WL-500GP rather than the 3700 because I get 2 serial ports, and 2 usb.&nbsp; Even though I would like the extra ram and space and use the newer kernel.&nbsp; So WL-500GP wins on hardware features for my project need.&nbsp; I hope that helps.</p><p>arokh,<br />That WNDR3700 looks very nice BTW.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Demolishun!</p><p>What does it mean, that it has two internal IO? These is GPIO? Then I can use ASUS WL 500gP V2 with I2C devices, isn&#039;t it? And how, I have to remove the surface mounted LED-s, or where are these IO-s? Sorry about my naive question, but I am newbie in on robotic field.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear written_direcon!</p><p>This USB to serial converter is interesting. I asked my teacher, why should I spend my time with soldering, and to take a risk to burn the board. The answer was, just because a converter is only for test purpose. I dont know.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is certainly nothing functionally wrong with a usb-to-serial converter.&nbsp; I have used a half-dozen or more.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had best success with those which are based on the PL2303 chip, but also some success with CH341 (and some failures which I haven&#039;t explained).&nbsp; Ftdi-based converters also work.&nbsp; Many CH341 dongles are available on ebay for $2-3 US.</p><p>It is actually more difficult to use the built-in serial (for which you may have to open the case and solder in wires or a header) for control of external devices, because this is used as the console device, and outputs a great deal of text as the device boots.&nbsp; You can disable this, but that makes it harder to recover a bricked device.</p><p>There are also usb-to-i2c dongles, but I haven&#039;t used one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 12 Mar 2011, 20:24)</p>

					<p>I think I found a good solution to the lack of serial ports in the router.&nbsp; They carry a four port $13 USB hub at Walmart.&nbsp; It is very small and will fit inside the router.&nbsp; Not as clean as I wanted, but workable.</p><p>Edit:<br />This hub is awesome.&nbsp; It pops open with no screws, has a very small board inside, and has specs available: <a href="http://www.genesyslogic.com/manage/upfile/12052255151.pdf">http://www.genesyslogic.com/manage/upfi … 255151.pdf</a> .</p><p>The cool thing is it the chip may be programmable by the user.&nbsp; It is a processor in and of itself.&nbsp; At any rate, it solves my internal IO issues.</p><p>Edit again:<br />Here is a picture of the installed hub.&nbsp; This is so very nice!
