					<p>Okay, I&#039;m also now testing pure-ftp...<br />Did you check you average transfer ratio?<br />Here at my box pure-ftpd was using 2 MBytes/s in the beginning, but dropped now to 150 kbytes (after having reached like 600mb of the 4.2 gb file)... I think this could be the reason that the bug wasn&#039;t triggered yet.

I&#039;m using the 1.1 OHCI driver in my kernel and it&#039;s doing ok so far with vfat, ext3 and a swapfile. </p><p>But because of this forum i havn&#039;t done up a pivotroot just quite yet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;m going to be patient. </p><p>One thing that makes it very hard for me to blame the wireless driver for these troubles is that the wireless interface is disabled by default - I haven&#039;t gotten around to enabling it yet. I don&#039;t even have an antenna hooked up- I&#039;m in the middle of nowhere and I&#039;m not broadcasting an SSID. All of my work has been done across a 100Mb/s network. As far as I am aware, no packets have been burst at any rate whatsoever to or from the wireless driver, although it does reside in memory. </p><p>I guess one test I could do would be to recompile a kernel with no wireless support and then re-enable the EHCI-HCD 2.0 drivers... just to see what happens...</p>									</div>

I can transfer big files through Samba, FTB as well as HTTP. Please note, if one use only USB 1 without ehci, then transfers are relatevelly low. Some one said that problem does not appear when transfer is limited.
