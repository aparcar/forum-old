					<p>I read the WebIF page wrong (there&#039;s also a learning disability involved here, so things like this can mislead me) and set the WAN and LAN IP address on my WRTSL54GS to the same address.&nbsp; I had not yet set it so I could log in from the WAN interface and any attempt to connect from the LAN side fails.</p><p>I did leave bootwait set to 1 second, which I do whenever I&#039;m making changes, but I wonder if that will help because it still will have the same &quot;identity crisis&quot; issue.&nbsp; (I&#039;ve got no problem with reflashing this, there&#039;s not that much saved on it and I have to reflash it soon anyway so I can document all I do on it.)</p><p>What can I do to get access to this box?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
