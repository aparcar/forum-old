					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I just recently installed OpenWrt 8.09.1 on the NSLU2 server that I wanted to use as a PPTP VPN Server, installation went smoothly, even the two dependencies installed (kmod-mppe &amp; kmod-crypto); however, I have spent the next 2 to 3 hours searching this site and the web for relevant information on why the I am getting the &quot; MPPE required, but kernel has no support.&quot; error message within my log file. Unfortunately, most of the posts I have found so far are obsolete (using older firmware or 2 years old) or does not apply to my situation. </p><p>I have the initial configuration setup for the options.pptpd file (except the IP address is using 192.168.x.x), and I have also configured the chap-secrets correctly (yes I know per the log below I have to change the perms, but I&#039;ll do that later).</p><p>Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; /dev/pts/1<br />Warning - secret file /etc/ppp/chap-secrets has world and/or group access<br />MPPE required, but kernel has no support.<br />Connection terminated.<br />Connect time 0.1 minutes.<br />Sent 0 bytes, received 0 bytes.</p><p>Can any of you guys or gals please help me with this issue?</p><p>I thank you in advance for any insight or help you may have to offer.</p>									</div>
