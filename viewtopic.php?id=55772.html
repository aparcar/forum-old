					<p>I just purchased a Netgear Nighthawk X4 R7500 router and have quickly discovered the horror stories about the stock Netgear firmware are true. Having been a long time user of OpenWrt, I already miss it dearly after just a single day. So I&#039;m interested in either donating the router to a reputable developer who would be committed to getting a build of Barrier Breaker going on it, or to setup a build environment that would allow me to do the same.</p><p>I see that there is already a build of Attitude Adjustment for it over at myopenrouter.com, though it apparently doesn&#039;t work with the 5ghz band nor does it support any external packages. It does run a Qualcomm Atheros CPU and a secondary Quantenna CPU. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi <br />the AA version does work with 5GHz and a few people are currently attempting to compile packages for it. I used it for over a month on mine before the lack of packages forced me back to Gargoyle on my WDR4300. I would love to get a full AA or BB version running on my R7500.</p>									</div>
