					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a quick question. <br />I&#039;ve got a Netgear router with openwrt on it.<br />Now I got my Xbox one hooked up on the router. <br />The Xbox one says I use the following dns addres: 192.168.1.1.<br />Is it possible to change the dns address in the router to googles dns address? So my Xbox one automatically sees the Google dns address?.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Sean</p>									</div>

					<p>In principle, yes. Looks like actually the Netgear is running caching DNS (dnsmasq, most likely), so it sets the DNS server adrs to its own.<br />Has the general advantage of using the routers DNS cache for all connected devices.<br />Possible to disable the DNS cache (dnsmasq), and (always) use 8.8.8.8. Needs change of the settings in Netgear.<br />Nte, that this might slow down DNS-resolution for _all_ connected devices a little bit.<br />More sophisticated, but rather complicated setup, would allow the XBox _only_ to use 8.8.8.8 as DNS.</p><p>BTW: Why to use goggles DNS on XBox ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for you replay. </p><p>I play gta online and several isp in the Netherlands changed a setting in the dns address so now most people can&#039;t connect to gta online with there own isp dns address. </p><p>I already tried to change the dns on my Xbox, but that doesn&#039;t help. That&#039;s why I want to change the dns settings in my router. It doesn&#039;t really have to be google it may also be opendns or some other dns address. </p><p>So if someone could help me out with a simple tutorial on how to change my dns in the router that would be awesome! </p><p>Kind regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your router is acting as a DNS cache to all the devices in the network; that is why the XBOX is using the router as a DNS. Keep it like that, but configure the router to use Google&#039;s DNS instead. In the WAN interface configuration, uncheck &quot;use dns advertised by peer&quot;, and put Google&#039;s DNS at &quot;use custom DNS servers&quot;.</p>									</div>
