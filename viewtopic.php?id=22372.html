					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I am looking for a way to set up a wireless network (WPA protected) in a location where an area needs to be covered by two access points, conncted via cabled ethernet. When roaming between the two access-points, the ESS should take care about maintenance of potentially existing TCP-Sessions, and so on, over the cabled infrastructure, and not the wireless medium.<br />Cisco implemented a proprietary feature called WCCP in their Access-Points that takes care about that. As far as I can tell, TCP-Sessions are not torn down when roaming between two access-points communicating via wccp.</p><p>All I found here so far is this link:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10912">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10912</a></p><p>But it doesn&#039;t fully answer the question I have.<br />Of course the WPA Drivers might notice a better signal from the same SSID and would attempt to connect to the access-point that it receives a better signal from.</p><p>But imagine the situation:</p><p>Client -connected to-&gt; Access-Point A<br /> - Now the client moves out of range from Access Point A and sees Access-Point B with a better signal<br />Client -connecting to-&gt; Access-Point B</p><p>existing TCP-connections would have to be torn down in that case, because Access-Point B has no means of knowing the WPA session-keys negotiated between the client and Access-Point B.</p><p>There would need to be some sort of server knowing each state from all clients associated to the wireless network.</p><p>Is there a feature within openwrt that I could use for this?</p><p>Thanks in advance and br,</p><p>Matt</p>									</div>

					<p>I would also like to know if there is a way to do this without using Cisco. I only need 3 access points and Cisco wants $600 per 802.11G point and $2000 for a wlan controller capable of handling up to 6 access points. Bit to rich for this project. With my research I have not come across any current open standards that supports seem-less hand-off. I came across 802.11f which seemed to be the same thing as cisco&#039;s way, but it was withdrawn as a standard. Everyone always is talking about the client deciding but that WILL result in tcp connection tear-down. Cisco&#039;s way is seem-less. Motorola and Meru also have proprietary solutions that implement this technology. Although I have only delt with Cisco.</p><p>With the voip boom, i&#039;d be surprised if there isn&#039;t an open way to do this.</p>									</div>

					<p>What gives you guys the impression that the access point has anything to do with TCP sessions? And what in the world would WCCP have to do with wireless networks?</p><p>Handoff between access points can be problematic if the client has to pick &quot;the best&quot; access point by itself. This where the proprietary protocols come in. But if you&#039;re talking about a residential setting with only a handful of devices, it usually isn&#039;t an issue.</p>									</div>
