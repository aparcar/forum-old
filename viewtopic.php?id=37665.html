					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m fairly new to Openwrt and in a bit of a pickle right now. Currently the webUI that I see on my product is WebIF. I have some cgi script that is written in c that I want to put in the cgi-bin and execute it. I can&#039;t seems to figure out the right command for httpd.conf to pick up my cgi-c so it always goes to 404 Error. Any idea on how to run cgi script in c through httpd? </p><br /><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
