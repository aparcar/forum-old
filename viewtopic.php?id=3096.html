I found out that the pptd binary in the package 1.3.0-1 is compiled with bcrelay support but of course I still get an error due to the missing bcrelay binary.<br />The other problem is that I&#039;m not experienced in editing the iptables rules - I don&#039;t want to cause security flaws.</p><p>I don&#039;t know whether there existed a bcrelay binary for mipsel or not (I read somewhere that that there was one available some time ago).</p><p>So I&#039;d really appreciate any help I can get in solving this.

					<p>Aww, that&#039;s so disappointing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>No info on what happend to the bcrelay binary, no info on iptables, not even anybody screaming &quot;you&#039;re an idiot!&quot;.<br />Why? Is my language that bad that nobody gets what I write? Or am I doing something completly wrong?<br />I really tried to handle those iptables rules and googled and whatnot... for hours!<br />That are the rules I&#039;m using at the moment for pptp clients... local network and pptp clients are in the same subnet (because of proxy arp which is not working when they&#039;re in different ones):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables        -A forwarding_rule -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT

Is there a security problem when simultanously using pppoe as my WAN connection (ppp+ includes my ppp0 pppoe interface)? If I want to do the rule on every connection I could use the ip-up.sh script - but the rules have to be a little different for that, right?</p><p>Is iptables able to forward broadcasts? Sadly, I&#039;m not even able to broadcast between br0 and my vlan2 (which should be part of br0 - vlan2 only uses another IP range... 192.168.1.* for local network and pptp and 192.168.0.* for vlan2/port4)</p><p>I would be really grateful, if someone could give me some kind of hint.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>simba87</strong> on 14 Sep 2007, 12:52)</p>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I also tried to get bcrelay to work with no success.<br />But as I understood, the bcrelay code got into the pptpd package, or should get into it also for the OpenWrt package.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to motivate on this for the Freifunk firmware, which is a variant of OpenWrt.<br />And I can already read it in (todos/ideas): <a href="http://download-master.berlin.freifunk.net/ipkg/ChangeLog">http://download-master.berlin.freifunk. … /ChangeLog</a> .</p><p>Unfortunately <a href="http://download-master.berlin.freifunk.net/ipkg/packages/pptpd_1.3.0-2_mipsel.ipk">http://download-master.berlin.freifunk. … mipsel.ipk</a> didn&#039;t contain it in the last version I have tested. Got the failure that bcrelay is an unrecognized option. But since the current build is from yesterday, probably something already changed.<br />Or you will have success in compiling it for this OpenWrt variant.</p><p>Normally, such standard packages are compatible with both systems without any problems.</p><p>Greetings</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m pretty happy that I&#039;m not alone in trying to get that to work (I&#039;m not happy that this is a problem for us, though <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)<br />As I stated before... there&#039;s a pptpd binary for openwrt compiled with bcrelay support, but the bcrelay binary is missing in that package, too.<br />Are you experienced in compiling for OpenWrt? I have to say that it&#039;s painful for me - I&#039;m no C programmer and compiling C/C++ code (even if it&#039;s only for x86) is a problem for me.</p><p>But my question still remains: Is there any chance to forward the broadcasts by using iptables?</p><p>It would be very nice if you could post here if there are any news on how to solve this.

					<p>Okay.<br />I&#039;ve read from integration, splitting, and so on.<br />So if it&#039;s included or not depends on the version I think.</p><p>I&#039;ve found out that dd-wrt also used to have bcrelay, so the binary propably could be transfered from it.

					<p>Okay, it works!<br />Bcrelay just terminates itself often when the traffic is heavy (or something). (possibly other newer versions can help?)<br />So it must be started again and again, I did this with a loop and not running as daemon as the pptpd executable starts it.<br />Only problem so far, some programs use the &quot;wrong&quot; ip to broadcast (other than the vpn ip), which could be set in some settings sometimes. Because normally, there will be no routes back to other interfaces as the vpn one.<br />If -i ppp0 -o br0 or -i br0 +o ppp0 seems to do not matter, bcrelay relays in both directions (to the 255.255.255.255 adress, even when only coming as a subnet broadcast on the other interface.)</p>									</div>

					<p>v1.3.4 is working much better, bcrelay didn&#039;t get killed until now, and I&#039;ve tested the same heavy traffic as on the last version. So it seems that the instability issue is gone :-).<br />Reading of the lan interface name from the nvram also works as it should, great addition!</p><p>So, now that you definitely know how to build the package, can you give me little advice on that, like a general link on what I have to do, and especially what I have to take care in the special case of pptpd with bcrelay. And which source to use?</p><p>Because there are always new versions coming (like the already avalaible 1.3.4-2 which has an &quot;additional patch to fix regression in GRE re-ordering&quot;. So if you don&#039;t mind to build this one someday, I will test it with enjoyment too.</p><p>Greetings</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>

					<p>I wasn&#039;t aware that there&#039;s a more up to date CVS tree on the sourceforge site - last time I took the source from the .tar.gz under downloads.</p><p>I&#039;ll make the explanation short because I don&#039;t want to waste time with things you already know <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />If there should be questions don&#039;t hesitate to ask!<br />Hopefully I&#039;ll not forget anything. It&#039;s some days ago since I made the first package...<br />I took the SDK from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1.tar.bz2">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussi … -1.tar.bz2</a><br />You can try to build an example from the examples directory or you go ahead and take the package directory <br />via SVN from <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/whiterussian/openwrt/package/pptpd/">https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branche … age/pptpd/</a><br />This way you don&#039;t have to do the work twice.</p><p>Now comes the modifying part:<br />OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/package/pptpd/patches - I deleted them because they&#039;re for version 1.3.0, aren&#039;t they?<br />OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/package/pptpd/Makefile - change PKG_VERSION, PKG_RELEASE and PKG_MD5SUM if you have the MD5 from the new version. This way the package will be downloaded from Sourceforge (identified through PKG_NAME &amp; PKG_VERSION). Add configure options like --enable-bcrelay and delete old ones (like the --with-pppd-ip-alloc that isn&#039;t needed since 1.3.1 (there isn&#039;t a replacement, right?))<br />If you want to create a full package you have to avoid that the LIBDIR variable is replaced by the Makefile.in in the pptpd source package. So, delete the export line around line 686.</p><p>And if you believe it or not - you&#039;re ready to crosscompile the thing.<br />cd to your OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1 directory and type<br /><strong>make pptpd-clean V=99<br />make pptpd-prepare V=99<br />make pptpd-compile V=99</strong></p><p>OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/bin/packages should now contain the ipk file.<br />If there&#039;s a more straight forward way then tell me, please <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>*edit* I forgot to add the package for pptpd 1.3.4-2<br /><a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/59997271/pptpd_1.3.4-2-2_mipsel.ipk.html">http://rapidshare.com/files/59997271/pp … l.ipk.html</a><br />-------------------------------</p><p>However, I do have some problems with the pptpd.

					<p>Thank you for the description for compiling the package. I will try this as soon as I have time for it.<br />But before I&#039;ll try the pptpd v1.3.4-2.</p><p>Okay, and now what you can do for seeing the broadcasts..</p><p>The VPN Client normally does not have a explicit route to the LAN. But the the default route can do it. If not, or there is none, add a route to the whole LAN range via the gateway.<br />On the LAN client side, the same thing, add a route to the VPN range if the default route can&#039;t do it.</p><p>Your forwarding and input/output rules should be okay, but don&#039;t forget that you also need them from VPN-&gt;LAN, LAN-&gt;VPN (and what you already have VPN-&gt;VPN).<br />But to avoid any firewall issues while testing, I recommend to deactivate it (i.e. /etc/init.d/S45firewall stop).</p><p>On the router, there should be the routes between VPN to LAN, LAN to VPN and VPN to VPN. This can be checked easy by pinging a lan client from vpn, vpn client from lan, and vpn client from vpn. If this works, we should be able to cross the finish line soon.</p><p>For testing the broadcasts, I never used ping. And I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s possible.<br />Instead you can try Wireshark or something similar which will capture you all packets on the network, and there you can set a filter to only see the two (three) broadcast adresses, i.e. 192.168.1.255 and 255.255.255.255 (and LAN.LAN.LAN.255)</p><p>On the LAN side you should than see packets with source IP 192.168.1.x and destination 255.255.255.255. Regardless if they were going to 192.168.1.255 or 255.255.255.255 on the VPN side.<br />On the VPN side you should see the broadcasts with LAN source address with destination 255.255.255.255 to.</p><p>If you capture the packets on both sides, LAN and VPN, you will see what&#039;s going on very well.</p><p>For testing heavy broadcast traffic I used a game in LAN mode. They often have a Lobby, and there you should see all Users, which is done by broadcasts. In game traffic normally is sent direct.</p><p>Good Luck</p><p>Alex</p><br /><p>..and don&#039;t complain about your english, it&#039;s quite well, I understand everything and it&#039;s also not my mother tongue..</p>									</div>
