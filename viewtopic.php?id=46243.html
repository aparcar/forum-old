					<p>Hi there,<br />i recently bought one of these really cheap Phicomm M1 Routers which are already in the OpenWRT Trac system: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13432">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13432</a></p><p>According to a polish website which also features some internal photos of that device <a href="http://eko.one.pl/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=72477#p72477">http://eko.one.pl/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=72477#p72477</a> it should be possible to run OpenWRT on that Router, but without network support.</p><br /><p>I have seen that the Router is based on a BCM5356C0 CPU, where there seem to be some issues with in OpenWRT. But the other specs like 4MB Flash and 32MB Ram seem promising to me, especially because that router only costs approx. 16â‚¬ here in Germany, without the need to ship it from China like the WR703N.</p><p>So what do the devs think, will there be support for this in the future?</p>									</div>

					<p>I do not like the device. The usb port is just a power source. There is no usb data connected.</p>									</div>
