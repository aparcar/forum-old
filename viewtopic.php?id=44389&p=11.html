					<p>Hi taeuber,</p><p>thanks for your reply. Finally I managed to get everything working.<br />But is it normal that port0 and port1 do not work if I plug in a cable?<br />I configured 2 VLANs for ports 2-5 in order to create an uplink port as a workaround.</p><br /><br /><p>My steps to unbrick the device:</p><p>Enter UART mode: <br />I used adhesive tape to bridge the R80 transistor with a very small peace of metal.<br />Then i used an jumper camble to lay the 3,3V from the pin of the back to the Transistor R45.<br />Fixed everthing with a finger and used the other hand to plug in the power cord. </p><p>Flash ASC bootloader:<br />i flashed the boot loader via cat to get a console.<br />I had to try out 2 different bootloaders. One did work.</p><p>Then i followed the instructions on this page h**p://lektiondestages.blogspot.de/2015/05/using-easybox-803a-arcadyan-arv752dpw22.html<br />Basically following steps:<br />- B: Upload new U-Boot or kernel image using XMODEM&quot; (use the nor image!!! this uploades the image to RAM)<br />- Copy uploaded image into flash (this copies the image from RAM to flash)</p>									</div>

After digging deeper, the surprising answer on my question is the following:</p><p>Based on ./target/linux/lantiq/dts/ARV752DPW22.dts<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>                                partition@20000 {

Thus, I&#039;ve tried to max out this capacity of course.</p><p>Back in March I&#039;ve built my own firmware, with 7.50MB, which was accepted by the firmware flashing page of luci without any fuss (saying &quot;available size is 7.69MB&quot;).<br />Now, after leaving out some packages so having a 7.25MB firmware it is all good, my settings do survive a reboot. It surprises me, but still having kind of lack of time, I don&#039;t care much about the reason but the outcome. Any voluntary explanation is welcome, though.</p>									</div>
