					<p>Hi guys!</p><p>I&#039;m trying to cross-compile nodejs and install it in my OpenWRT system. I&#039;ve seen that there was a git repository for that, but it is no longer work.</p><p>Then, I&#039;m asking if there is anyone who has compiled nodejs for openwrt successfully and how he did it. Thank you!</p>									</div>
