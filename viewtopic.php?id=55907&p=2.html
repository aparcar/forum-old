					<p>Hello everyone, im new to this Forum and i want to ask a few things.<br />i recently bought a TP-link cpe 210 to use it as access point for 30 - 40 users but every 4-5 days i have to unplug and plug again to power socket becouse it wont allow any other devices to connect. TP link told me that is firmware limited to 20 users for better performance.<br />anyway i want to ask if is possible to install open wrt to this device... is it easy? <br />i have found these two firmware. <br />1. <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-cpe210-220-510-520-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … actory.bin</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />2. <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-cpe210-220-510-520-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … pgrade.bin</a><br />all i need to do is upgrade from the web interface like i do with the original firmware?<br />thanks .</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ghk84</strong> on 4 Aug 2016, 18:49)</p>

					<p>being a dual chain device it should handle at least 100 users without problem, especially since they advertise better spectrum use with MAXtream TDMA technology. anything else from their side are lame excuses.</p><p>as long as i remember openwrt does not support this device properly at the moment, but there is a patch in LEDE website that enables LNA so it could work.</p>									</div>
