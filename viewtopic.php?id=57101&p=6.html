					<p>Maybe you could show us common mistakes, so that we can learn a few things, I&#039;m probably making all the classic mistakes, and i try to fix them but it&#039;s hard to fix something when you still have to figure out the correct way. And thus make new mistakes that still need fixing.&nbsp; At this point I&#039;m taking a focus on small issues like typo&#039;s and details.&nbsp; Also wondering if there is a need for Dutch translations.&nbsp; And how to keep a translation in sync with the main wiki.&nbsp; Maybe only translate pages that are in a more final stage?

					<p>Hi guys.</p><p>I have rearranged the WNDR3700 page. I had already started adding the tabboxes (liking this very much btw) when I noticed richbhanover had done so already at the bottom.</p><p>I would like to suggest links to firmware images are provided like this - with a clear but concise distinction between sysupgrade and factory images and links to both:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#tab__firmware_downloads">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wn … _downloads</a></p><p>I don&#039;t know if you pull this from your data template as well but it looks a lot easier on the eye when the links are wrapped in text like in my example. I suppose this has been brought up before, don&#039;t know how feasible it is to have [[$url|$text]] parsed in the templates.</p><p>Either way, the templates are an excellent starting boilerplate but once info gets specific I personally find it to complicate things (I do understand the need for standardisation though).</p><p>Keep up the good work.</p>									</div>
