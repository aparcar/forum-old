					<p>I have a NETGEAR DG834Nv1 access point/router operating in WPA2-PSK mode with wireless isolation and a non-broadcasting SSID.</p><p>I cannot connect to it from some Belkin kit running OpenWRT if MAC Address filtering is turned on at the AP. Yes, I have made sure the MAC&#039;s are ok. From an Atheros card in a PC (running Gentoo) I have the exact same issue.</p><p>If I disable MAC filtering and then associate the connection, then turn it back on it works.</p><p>It is as if during association it uses a different MAC address.</p><p>Any ideas if this is the case and if so:</p><p>*) What MAC address is it using - something like 00:00:00:00:00:00 ?</p><p>*) How to disable this MAC address changing stuff ?</p>									</div>
