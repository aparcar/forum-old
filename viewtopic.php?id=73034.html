					<p>I&#039;ve noticed a while back there were discussions about the speed of (pre-LEDE era) routing performance not being up to gigabit speeds due to not being able to access hardware acceleration on the SoCs of devices at the time.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering what the status of that is these days, and for routers with more powerful CPUs, if that&#039;s even an issue anymore? (I.E. I&#039;m running on WRT3200 and the CPU pretty much never even comes under meaningful load even with SQM/layer_cake. </p><p>Are there still routing performance issues that makes OpenWRT not ideal for gigabit routing compared to OEM?</p>									</div>
