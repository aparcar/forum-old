					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve had a <a href="http://www.huawei.com/enmobile/consumer/more-product/e5372-en.htm">Huawei E5372</a> for a few years, its a mobile router with built-in in 4G. And I would love the ability to connect to my OpenVPN server directly for it. And push the clients directly to the VPN, so they can talk inside the VPN.</p><br /><p>There not seem to be <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">official support</a> for it, there is some <a href="https://www.google.pt/search?sitesearch=openwrt.org&amp;domains=openwrt.org&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Huawei+E5372&amp;btnG=Google&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=ov1RVs3lJMSua-eHjcgP#q=Huawei+E5372+site:openwrt.org&amp;safe=off&amp;domains=openwrt.org&amp;start=0">activity</a> on the project for it. </p><p>Are there any plans to support this device on the future?</p><p>What are the equvalent devices that are supported by OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>masterkorp</strong> on 22 Nov 2015, 21:51)</p>
