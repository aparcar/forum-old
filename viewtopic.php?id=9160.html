					<p>This is intended as a basic get up and running tutorial for someone who wants to run Multiple WAN IPS.</p><p>Ok this is how I did multi-nat on a cheap router(Linksys WRT54GS).<br />(that is, multiple wan ips or multiple public ips through a single router)</p><p>Not terribly complicated for someone that can follow directions and knows their way around a computer.</p><p>I spelled out (the best I could) how to do every step. </p><br /><p>Using a Linksys box (or a box that can be hacked to a linux command prompt)<br /> I used my existing Linksys WRT54GS (version 1.1) to install openWRT (think you can use dd-wrt or others). The object of doing this is&nbsp; is to be able to issue the iptables command at the command prompt.</p><p>1. Find suitable Hardware good place to look: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a></p><p>2. You may want to clear your port forwarding section of router so all is done in same place in iptables.</p><p>3. Install (via linksys upgrade firmware page/ or flashing utility esp Linksys V5-6)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - download from here (latest release for your router version should work fine)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org">http://downloads.openwrt.org</a>/&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had to navigate to whiterussian - RC6 - bin and selected my file <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin /You may need the micro version...check your ROUTER VERSION<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-for Linksys v5-v6 don&#039;t despair, someone created a flashing utility <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (go here <a href="http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/ow.asp?WRT54G5_CFE#h7)">http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase â€¦ G5_CFE#h7)</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -much more about installing here....probably wise to read)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; open router page to upgrade and browse to where you put the .bin file<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -begin upgrade process and wait<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (When flashing, DO NOT stop the process, let it finish or ELSE you may have trouble ever using your router again) </p><p>4. log in to router -via browser <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(keeps same password and settings from linksys but you can set basics here if things get fowled up)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -set password while at it <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (to make sure) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -Verify/Install packages (still in broswer)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (I have these installed: ip ipkg iptables iptables-mod-extra iptables-utils)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.navigate to [categories:] -- System -- select installed software)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Update Package List<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. scroll down and Select install if you don&#039;t have the one listed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -May as well make sure your IPS are still set(or set them): public and private, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (if you want to save any settings you must do two things: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.hit SAVE (saves to file system) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.hit APPLY (saves them to config and reloads config)</p><p>5. Open up putty (SSH terminal window )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -google putty<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -run<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -goto your router&#039;s IP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; login as user:ROOT password:[It&#039;sYOURpassword]</p><p>6. issue commands as neccessary for your situation:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(if you need help type the command and -h ie: ip -h. If you get an error with that...go back and install the packages)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -this sets up secondary IPs (the first can be done via browser)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ip addr add 169.168.167.2/24 dev vlan1&nbsp; (here&#039;s my second)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ip addr add 169.168.167.3/24 dev vlan1&nbsp; (here&#039;s my third)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -this routes the packet<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 169.168.167.2 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.10:80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -this opens the port for forwarding&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.0.10 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT</p><p>7. NVRAM commit (commits the configuration to NonVolatile RAM) survives reboot</p><br /><p>That&#039;s all I had to do...can&#039;t guarantee the same results but give it a try. You can completely flash your router back to normal as long as you&#039;re careful using TFTP.&nbsp; When flashing, DO NOT stop the process, let it finish or ELSE (you may have trouble ever using your router again).</p><p>Have fun, learn more, and NAT on my friend, NAT on.</p><p>Aaron Gill</p><br /><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Here&#039;s the break down of the command: </p><p> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 169.168.167.1 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.10:80</p><p>part of command = Meaning&nbsp; [options for MULTINAT puposes] <br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />-t &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = table<br />NAT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = table name for -t option<br />-A&nbsp; (-I)&nbsp; &nbsp; = Append (think add this rule) or Insert&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[-D = Delete this rule ...rule must be exactly the same as -A or it won&#039;t delete]<br />PREROUTING/&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; = Routing stage(chain) at which this rule is implemented<br />FORWARD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />-p&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = protocol<br />tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = the protocol for -p <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[UDP]<br />-d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = Destination IP<br />169.168.167.1&nbsp; &nbsp;= incoming public ip address(wan ip) <br />--dport&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= specifically heading to port<br />80&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = the port for --dport argument<br />-j&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = Jump to location<br />DNAT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = LOCATION for -j<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[SNAT]<br />--to-destination= to a destination of (ip address/range/ports etc )<br />192.168.0.10:80&nbsp; &nbsp; = IP address and port to go to on nat side<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[also can just used ip only...192.168.0.10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; or a range of ips.............192.168.0.5-192.168.0.50 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; or a range of ports...........192.168.0.10:80-90&nbsp; ]</p>									</div>
