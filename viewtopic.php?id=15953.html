					<p>I have my own instance of BIND running on a local machine here in the office, which is used as our public DNS.&nbsp; In short, I have set up firewall rules to do the following:</p><p>DNSLookup -&gt; Wan -&gt; local server</p><p>i.e., when someone hits one of my domain names from outside my office, it resolves correctly and they can hit the site.&nbsp; </p><p>However, when someone in my office tries to do the same, the domain will not resolve.</p><p>There are several ways to solve this, but I&#039;d like to set all my office machines to only use the DNS provided by our upstream host.&nbsp; It, in turn, should query our DNS for authoritative responses to requests for hosts on my domains.</p><p>I&#039;m a DNS newbie, and only recently discovered and installed openWRT.&nbsp; I&#039;m using kamikaze.&nbsp; Other than this issue, things are peachy.</p><p>Here are the rules from my firewall scripts that I&#039;ve set up thus far:</p><p>/etc/setup/firewall:<br />forward:proto=tcp dest=207.70.62.18 dport=53:192.168.0.30:53<br />forward:proto=udp dest=207.70.62.18 dport=53:192.168.0.30:53</p><p>/etc/firewall.user:<br />iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d 207.70.62.18 -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A forwarding_rule -p udp --dport 53 -d 192.168.0.30 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />#iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -s 192.168.0.0/24 -p udp --dport 53 -d 192.168.0.30 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>If I uncomment that last line in firewall.user, then the server (which hosts bind, postfix, apache, etc) can&#039;t look up any domains on external DNS - it tries to send a dns request but the wrt sends it right back, as it is forwarding and masquerading all dns lookups from the lan.</p><p>Help!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>-- Kimball</p>									</div>

					<p>I take it that the wrt is your gateway to the outside world, it has a static ip and you don&#039;t have dnsmasq running. Your problem is that your server has two different IPs: One external, reachable from outside and one internal one, in the 192.168.0.0 net. Your clients get the external IP back from the server, and your wrt doesn&#039;t do &quot;loop routing&quot;: from internal to external to internal again.<br />Options that I see:<br />1. DNS &quot;Split-horizon&quot; may be possible. Afaik Bind can answer queries differently depending from where the request comes. Look in the bind docs for &quot;views&quot; .<br />2. Depending on your ISP setup, you could also put your server that answers queries from external in a DMZ, without portforwarding. Int and ext &quot;see&quot; the same IP.<br />3. Use a different domain internally, maybe even move out your public DNS/web entirely. DNS through IP port forwarding can be brittle.</p>									</div>
