					<p>Hi All</p><p>I&#039;d like to download a copy of this Broadcom file. I&#039;ve checked a few places. I don&#039;t suppose there&#039;s a repositary somewhere on OpenWRT ?</p><p>Failing that, if your router has this file e.g. DGN2200v1, have you already extracted the CFE from it ?</p><p>Cheers in advance</p><p>jeq<br />PS A photo of something similar here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/doc/techref/bootloader/cfe_nvram-bcm63xx_2.png?id=doc%3Atechref%3Abootloader%3Acfe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/_detail/doc/tec … ader%3Acfe</a><br />I presume that the version number can be read from inside the file somewhere ....</p>									</div>

					<p>One thing that&#039;s become clear is that the version number is at address 0x0570.</p><p>There&#039;s a sting &#039;cfe-v&#039; followed by 5 numbers. If those hex numbers are converted to decimal you get the broadcom version number. In the photo, you can see that its v1.0.37-3.6.</p><p>I have a copy of one CFE that&#039;s the one I&#039;m looking for but the endianess issue has caused the values to be in the wrong positions.</p><p>I presume that this can be corrected quite easily.

					<p>Haha, I feel as though I&#039;m about to learn something rather basic ...</p><p>Thanks for that link. It doesn&#039;t have the CFE for the MBRN3000 or DGN2200v1 but I did take a look at the CFE for DG834GTB.</p><p>That one also seems to have the bytes in reverse order i.e. the endian issue.</p><p>This begs a question:<br />If you dump a block of memory, shouldn&#039;t the order of the bytes in the dump file match exactly what was in memory ?</p><p>What we seem to have here is that bytes have been taken 4 at a time, reversed and then placed in the dump file.</p><p>But clearly that process is completely reversible. Is that how JTAG tools work ?</p><p>I also had a look at the Globesurfer CFE which is quite different to the one I have. But thanks for the link, all the same. It&#039;s the sort of thing you expect should exist but sometimes hard to find.</p>									</div>

					<p>It becomes clearer ... the copy of the CFE that I obtained is already in the correct state to be sent back to the router via JTAG. It&#039;s byte-swapped.</p><p>The person who backed up their CFE, generating that file, decided not to use the<br />/swap_endian</p><p>switch. If they had no need to search through or modify the CFE file, it would make life easier to just accept the file as the router&#039;s CPU generated it. And then send exactly the same file back afterwards.</p><p>So to answer your question, Anarchy, when I restored the CFE file I removed the byte-swapping.</p><p>I thought I needed to do that but that was wrong.</p><p>I also read that some CFE files contain a MAC address but I haven&#039;t seen one so far. I&#039;m wondering if that would be present as 12 ascii characters and maybe 5 colon characters as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>And it becomes slightly clearer again. That CFE version number applies to more than 1 CFE file and they have different contents depending on the router model.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for the CFE for an MBRN3000v1. 64 KiB.</p><p>Has anybody dumped that CFE or know where it can be obtained e.g. in the Netgear open source download package ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you can get it from the Netgear source code<br /><a href="http://download2.polytechnic.edu.na/pub4/sourceforge/o/of/officialnetgearfirmware/MBRN3000-V1.0.0.65NA.zip">http://download2.polytechnic.edu.na/pub … 0.65NA.zip</a><br />It&#039;s at targets/CFE subdirectory. BTW this bootloader might be different from the original at your device.</p><p>About endianess, newer versions of hairydairymaid software (i.e zjtag) are aware of endianness, they reverse endian automatically when reading/writing.</p>									</div>
