					<p>Hi,</p><p>Can anyone explain something about CFE? I honestly think I&#039;ve tried all the docs and done a lot of googling!</p><p>There seem to be two radically different implementations of CFE out there.</p><p>According to which platform, supported commands in CFE seem to vary drastically between a few one or two letter commands and a much more complete set with comands such as nvram, setenv and a way of passing parameters (such as root=) to the kernel.</p><p>It seems that bcm47xxs tend to have the complete set and bcm63xx the limited one.</p><p>Mine only has the f/h option to speciffy flassh or tftp source and it only allows you to specify a single file to tftp or run.</p><p>1) Is there a &quot;backdoor&quot; to gain the extended commands?<br />2) Is there a *reliable* way to build and install a new CFE (eg using the toolkit on the Broadcom site) - I have serial but no JTAG.<br />3) What I&#039;m trying to achieve is mounting a usb device on root. So far I&#039;ve explored various options, but the assumption that you *will* have a squashfs root on device node 31:0 is built right into the bcm specific stuff in linux/arch/mips.</p><p>Thanks in advance and Happy 2011.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi bbigg,</p><p>I think you may be misinterpreting what CFE is.&nbsp; It&#039;s the boot code that gets things started, has a few features, can be affected by nvram contents, can initialize nvram but is hardly ever changed and never a part of standard firmware images.&nbsp; The CFE starts firmware - but not as a part of it.&nbsp; Firmware images reside in their own place in flash memory, as does nvram.&nbsp; CFE typically remains untouched.</p><p>All this, AFAIK, is a Broadcom structure adopted by many manufacturers.</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to hear what&#039;s going on with the Actiontec - is that some kind of extension of CFE?&nbsp; My older stuff (Linksys) had a CFE taking up most of a 256k block and it doesn&#039;t behave much like a BIOS, which is what it sounds like you have there.</p>									</div>

My problem now seems to be the amount of pre compiled binaries making up a large part of the system (smd, ssk, sshd, telnetd, etc). Even sshd comes with a source tree but no config.log to indicate how it was built! Is this a possible GPL violation?

The open source alternatives to the bcmImageBuilder tool typically allow the firmware hacker to specify his own offsets, but that increases the likelihood of errors.</p><p>Incidentally, using imagetag as a base, I developed a 100% compatible open source alternative to bcmImageBuilder. [2] It has identical command-line options to bcmImageBuilder (bIM), support for little-endian images, and it correctly calculates the image CRC where the image contains the CFE as well as the rootfs and kernel images. In coding that tool, I discovered a few oddities about bIM. For example, it&#039;s possible to use the tool to create a Broadcom flash image that contains ONLY the CFE bootloader.</p><p>cheers,<br />asbokid</p><p>[1] <a href="http://www.jstic.com/Newsgroup/Zyxel/P-2812HNU-51c/P-2812HNU-51c_infos.txt">http://www.jstic.com/Newsgroup/Zyxel/P- … _infos.txt</a><br />[2] <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B6wW18mYskvBNWJhNmFkYTgtZmE0MS00YTlmLTg5MDAtMjkwNjJjNGViZGYz&amp;hl=en_US">https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B6wW18 … p;hl=en_US</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>asbokid</strong> on 23 Jul 2011, 06:40)</p>

					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>thanks for the info shared in this post, but I couldn&#039;t get any &quot;CFE&gt;&quot; pronpt from my P-2812HNU-51c once powered up and boot stopped.
