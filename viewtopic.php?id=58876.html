					<p>Dear people @ OpenWRT forums,</p><p>I am working on a project to get the C1 working as mobile device in an ad hoc network with OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing Protocol). To facilitate this I intend to use the C1 running OpenWRT. For the device to become wireless I intend to use the WiFi Module 3 (RTL8188CUS). Now I know for a fact that the RTL8192cu driver works for the WiFi module, as it is used on both laptop and the Ubuntu Trusty SD card provided by Hardkernel. The OpenWRT package that I use instead of trusty I found here: <a href="http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=114&amp;t=8634#p89949">http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f â€¦ 634#p89949</a> and this package has the drivers in them. However, after inserting the module nothing pretty much happens except for this line:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Wed Aug  5 14:19:58 2015 kern.info kernel: [  429.408759@3] usb 1-1.1: new high-speed USB device number 6 using dwc_otg</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve tried to install the kmod-8192cu package (provided by OpenWRT), however, this installs rtl_usb for the wrong kernel (I am using 3.10.75 provided by Hardkernel) and the drivers are supposedly already there for the Odroid-C1 so...</p><p>I wonder why it is not working? Could anyone provide some advice? Anyone got a WiFi module working with this setup? Please tell me!</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SV</strong> on 6 Aug 2015, 13:27)</p>
