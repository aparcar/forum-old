					<p>Could you post a photo or paste the entire boot log leading up to the error?</p><p>edit: ALSO, about the web GUI. No OpenWRT does not come with a GUI by default. However, you can install a web interface called LuCI through the OpenWRT package manager once you get your install running. <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a></p><p>You can also build your own OpenWRT image that automatically includes luci if that&#039;s convenient for you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jake_b</strong> on 16 Dec 2015, 17:03)</p>

					<p>Maybe I am wrong, but as far as I can tell that looks like a successful boot. Does the Raspberry Pi have an IP address? Have you tried telneting to it? You should be able to plug directly into it and then telnet into it with `telnet 192.168.1.1`. You may have to configure your computers ethernet interface settings manually as this:</p><p>gateway: 192.168.1.1<br />static IP: 192.168.1.10<br />subnet: 255.255.255.0</p>									</div>

					<p>But OpenWRT is 192.168.1.1 by default, so you need to unplug it from your network and plug your laptop directly into it, telnet 192.168.1.1, then set it up as you need by editing /etc/config/network and running passwd to enable ssh.</p>									</div>
