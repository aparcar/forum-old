					<p>Hello,<br /> my goal is to be able to flash my own images to D-Link DSL-362 (2MB flash) and D-Link DSL-G684T. For start I would be happy just for command line rather ssh (dropbear) than telnet.<br />So far I&#039;m able to compile my own images and flash them through FTP of ADAM2. Only I wasn&#039;t successful of running any yet.&nbsp; <br /> The main reason why could that be is that I don&#039;t know how to set mtd variables. The only thing I only know is that I must preserve the mtd2 untouched. </p><p>Are the mtd values always the same or I&#039;m supposed to change them whenever I use different size of image?</p><p>If anything I said is unclear please ask.<br />I appreciate every piece of advice.</p><p>P.S.: I tried <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a><br />Backfire 10.03 branch (with broken packages enabled)<br />Kamikaze 8.09 branch</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kuncik</strong> on 20 Dec 2010, 15:51)</p>
