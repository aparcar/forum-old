Those who doesn&#039;t have a id is called annoymous. So the id will be assigned by the uci, like cfg123. Such as the wifi-iface in the wireless, it has no id but the type &quot;wifi-iface&quot;. So&nbsp; it will be assigned an id by the uci jus like cfg12345. </p><p>Second, you can find a function which you find helpfull in cbi.lua in ~/luci/, named cbid(). You can read it find more how to referrence it as well as uci.lua in ~/luci/model/ which will also do some help.</p><p>I hope it will help. If some mistakes, please tell me. </p><p>Wandy</p>									</div>
