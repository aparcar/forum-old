					<p>I&#039;m running three DIR-825s with 10.03.&nbsp; The first one is setup with the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz radios in AP mode.&nbsp; The other two have the 2.4GHz in AP mode, and the 5GHz in client mode to connect to the 5GHz radio of the first router.&nbsp; The goal here is for someone to be able to connect to any of the 2.4GHz radios to get online, as the latter two will use the 5GHz as a backbone to connect back to the hardwire.</p><p>With two routers (one has a base and the other as a relay), this works great.&nbsp; It seems that when I add a second relay is when I have issues.&nbsp; The two relays seem to be intermittently connected.&nbsp; I can sometimes ping them, sometimes not.. sometimes at the same time, sometimes one at a time, sometimes neither.&nbsp; They seem to be completely random as to when they&#039;ll work.</p><p>I&#039;ve setup relayd to pseudobridge traffic between the 5GHz, the 2.4GHz, and the wired LAN ports on the two relays, and I believe my issue may be in here.&nbsp; The documentation on relayd shows setting up a pseudobridge between the wired LAN and a single radio in client mode, but it doesn&#039;t say anything about setting up a pseudobridge between a wired connection and two wireless connections, one of which is client and the other is AP.&nbsp; My /etc/config/network looks like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I read through the link you posted, and I don&#039;t have any experience with WDS, but my understanding is that WDS is to allow multiple single-radio access points to essentially rebroadcast the signal, thereby each hop halves the bandwidth.&nbsp; If I&#039;m understanding that correctly, that&#039;s not what I&#039;m looking for.</p><p>What I&#039;m wanting to do is to use the 5GHz radios as the backbone, and use the 2.4GHz radios as the APs that clients connect to.&nbsp; So a single DIR-825 will be receiving and rebroadcasting a packet from a client, but it&#039;ll be using two separate radios to do that, the 2.4GHz radio to communicate with the client, and the 5GHz radio to communicate with the backbone network.</p><p>If this still sounds like WDS applies, please let me know how so I can pursue that route.. thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Again, maybe I&#039;m missing something, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;m wanting WDS because I don&#039;t want a single AP to both communicate with another AP and a client device.</p><p>In any case, my original theory was that the problem was because I was including the 2.4GHz radio in the pseudobridge, which because it was in AP mode was already bridged and so I was created a redundancy that caused traffic to intermittently not be routed correctly.&nbsp; So I pulled it out of the bridge and removed the IP address from the 2.4GHz radio interface.&nbsp; The new configuration file looks like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>ok, it seams I was not clear enough. </p><p>you make a WDS-network for your backbone on the 5GHz wifi-interfaces (set the ssid to &quot;backbone&quot;). <br />main mainrouter as AP, the two client-router as STA and on all 3 you set &quot;option wds 1&quot;</p><p>then you configure the 2.4GHz wifi-interfaces as AP without WDS (set the ssid to &quot;myAP&quot; or whatever).<br />and bridge the 5GHz and the 2.4GHz interfaces (and probably the lan) together on every router. <br />backbone and the APs are completely seperated wifi-networks, which are then bridged together.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>this way you get the full bandwith for your backbone and also the full bandwith for your 2.4GHz APs (if you set them on different channels). Backbone and 2.4GHz APs doesn&#039;t use the same frequencies, so they don&#039;t have to share the bandwith. And it will be a completely transparent bridge (because of&nbsp; the 4-address-mode of WDS) and that&#039;s exactly what you want, even if you don&#039;t know it. Not that pseudo-bridge, layer2-NAT stuff. As I said before, it&#039;s good to have this option if it&#039;s not possible to implement WDS, but if it&#039;s possible it&#039;s really the better solution. With WDS you get a completly transparent bridge not an almost transparent bridge like with relayd, layer2-NAT, or WET-mode on broadcom</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 14 Apr 2012, 14:57)</p>
