					<p>I have a Netgear wndr3700 that is running Openwrt 10.03. I have a US Robotics USB modem and I&#039;d like to have failover to dialup. It has been many many years since I&#039;ve setup PPP manually in Linux. I can dialup using Minicom (the modem is supported by cdc_acm as device /dev/ttyACM0 ) and the device responds correctly to AT commends. Has anyone done this with 10.03?</p>									</div>
