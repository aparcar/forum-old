After struggeling for some time I have the switch running even VLAN works on final Attitude Adjustment. Here is what I have in my /etc/rc.local<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>swconfig dev eth0 set reset 1
swconfig dev eth0 set enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;
swconfig dev eth0 vlan 0 set ports &#039;0t 1&#039;
swconfig dev eth0 vlan 1 set ports &#039;0t 3 4 5&#039;
swconfig dev eth0 vlan 2 set ports &#039;0t 2&#039;
swconfig dev eth0 set apply
swconfig dev eth0 set enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;
swconfig dev eth0 set apply
swconfig dev eth0 set apply</code></pre></div><p>eth0.0 is not used, eth0.1 is my LAN connected to the bridge, eth0.2 is my WAN uplink port (port 2 in the config, labeled as port 4 on the router). The physical DSL port is not used in my setup.<br/>I have a similar config in /etc/config/network but just to make LuCI understand my setup and let me configure my interfaces. /etc/rc.local overwrites the settings on startup. Of course, once LuCI does config and reloads /etc/config/network, this is gone and I have to rerun /etc/rc.local or even reboot.</p><p>This works quite well but still not 100% stable. As you can see, I had to use &quot;set apply&quot; several times, don&#039;t know why but it increased stability. But still, once I reboot the router the WAN link doesn&#039;t come up any more. PPP link is not established, maybe the device that is connected to the WAN port doesn&#039;t provide an IP address... still working on it.</p><p>By the way, WLAN is also working fine for me...</p><p>Cheers<br/>macmeck</p>									</div>

After make menuconfig go to &quot;Image Configuration&quot;, &quot;Version configuration options&quot;, there you can specify the defaults if I&#039;m not mistaken.</p><p>Cheers<br/>macmeck</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>It looks like there are some new improvements in the switch configuration.</strong></p><p>On using a newer attitude adjustment build (r37559 on 28/07/2013) it &quot;seems&quot; the switch works for me properly.&nbsp; I am able to create VLANS on the switch and all appears working according the configuration and no debrick / resets are needed because of the switch misbehaving. I got a response from one of the wiki maintainers in the form of email confirming improvements to the configuration but without working seperate VLANS on the switch. Also I was maybe a bit zelous in putting this into the wiki. Sorry for that, I changed it to a quick link to this post in the meantime. If I find any improvements I&#039;ll put it here first. </p><p>What is working for me so far is that swconfig shows the settings I set and I am able to create more VLANS without needing to debrick or reset the device. I can do all this with luci and can confirm the changes with &#039;swconfig dev eth0 show&#039;&nbsp; and I see no errors anywhere in dmesg or on restarting the network with &#039;/etc/init.d/network/restart&#039; like I could see before.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t able to confirm if the switch actually works yet and will post back after testing tommorow. If anyone has any success with the new build please put your method and results here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/>. </p><p>What I noticed is the &#039;cpu&#039; port is untagged per default configuration and I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s more commonly tagged on other routers, so I&#039;m wondering what the actual standard setup should be here in theory if anyone knows. I&#039;ll try to test some configurations tommorow too or confirm if anyone elses config works for me. </p><p>Another issue I had before when trying to have seperate interfaces for both LAN ports and WIFI both with seperate zones is I would lose WAN access if I tried to put the WIFI into it&#039;s own firewall zone. That problem is gone now for me, not sure if anyone noticed it or if it was a switch issue.</p><p>A slightly more recent attitude adjustment build worked the same after an upgrade too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>debwalker</strong> on 9 Aug 2013, 16:52)</p>

					<p>I had this issue with WBMR for quite some time, even since DD-wrt days, when I wake my PC which is connected physically to the router, it will take about 10 seconds to get IP, in the other hand if I&#039;m connected wirelessly, it will give me the IP way faster. this is happening on both OpenWRT and DD-wrt, I tried setting up static IP from PC and from the router and the issue still there.</p><p>Anyone facing the same issue ?</p>									</div>
