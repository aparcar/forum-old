					<p>I have debricked my 3700 &amp; 3700v2 several times with the TFTP process. It works well.<br />There is no need for any pings in the process, and the advice in 3700 wiki is easier to understand.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#recovery.flash.in.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … lsafe.mode</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>You need: <br />•&nbsp; A TFTP client for your computer. There are both command-line tools and GUI versions available.<br />•&nbsp; Your computer must have an IP address from the 192.168.1.x network, as the router failsafe mode defaults to 192.168.1.1.<br />•&nbsp; A new firmware to flash in. Either an original Netgear firmware or an Openwrt &quot;factory.img&quot; firmware. &quot;Sysupgrade&quot; version will not work.<br />•&nbsp; Access to router&#039;s reset button</p><p>Steps needed in the flashing process: <br />1.&nbsp; configure and connect PC<br />2.&nbsp; power on the router<br />3.&nbsp; press and hold the RESET button as soon as the switch LEDs light up.<br />4.&nbsp; keep holding RESET until the power LED begins to flash orange and then green.<br />5.&nbsp; once the power LED is flashing green, release RESET<br />6.&nbsp; start the TFTP transfer to router at 192.168.1.1. <br />7.&nbsp; wait a few minutes for the router to complete flash.

However, the flashing process itself will take several minutes, after which the router should reboot automatically. Be patient – it will eventually come up as a brand new factory-fresh router with NETGEAR firmware (or Openwrt if you used the Openwrt &#039;factory&#039; firmware version for debricking).</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 7 Sep 2012, 12:02)</p>

Then you keep it pushed a few seconds until the power LED begins to flash orange and then green. Then you launch the TFTP upload.</p><p>3.&nbsp; press and hold the RESET button as soon as the switch LEDs light up.<br />4.&nbsp; keep holding RESET until the power LED begins to flash orange and then green.</p>									</div>

					<p>Try the WNDR3800 steps at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800#recovery.flash.in.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … lsafe.mode</a>. </p><p>The &quot;RESET&quot; button is a pinhole button on the bottom of the router labeled &quot;Factory Default Settings&quot;, not the power switch on the back of the router.</p><p>Make sure you are holding the RESET button down before powering the router on and continue to hold it until the power LED changes to flashing green or you start getting pings back. If it is anything like my WNDR3700 it will take 20 seconds or more before it goes into recovery mode if you do it right.</p><p>You will need to flash back to a Netgear firmware once it is in recovery mode. <a href="http://support.netgear.com/product/wndr3800">http://support.netgear.com/product/wndr3800</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Goofball</strong> on 7 Sep 2012, 21:21)</p>

					<p>I have indeed followed the &quot;Recovery flash in failsafe mode&quot; instructions to the letter.<br />Each and every time, the power light stays a solid amber.</p><p>I&#039;m assuming that by installing OpenWRT I&#039;ve voided the warranty, so is the next step to see if I can get any response with a serial cable?</p>									</div>
