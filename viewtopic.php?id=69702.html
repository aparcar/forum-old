					<p>I think that that collectd needs to be running continuously in order to do the summing up for longer periods.</p><p>You can look into the rrd database with e.g.<br /># rrdtool dump /tmp/rrd/LEDE/conntrack/conntrack.rrd | less</p><p>Then you can see that periodical averaging is done to have approx. 100+ data items for each data period. That means that e.g. for the &quot;hour&quot; data you have a datapoint every 30 seconds for the last hour, for the &quot;day&quot; every 14 minutes for the last 24 hours, and for the &quot;week&quot; every 2,5 hours, etc.</p><p>I wonder how &quot;Only create average RRAs&quot; has got deleted from for your config, as that has been the default in Openwrt/LEDE for ages. It prevents storing min/max etc. values, so that the RRD database keeps small. And I think that the LuCI statistics logic only expects to find the single average value. (you can naturally config collectd manually to do other stuff, but then don&#039;t expect LuCI statistics to understand your modifications. But for Luci statistics to work, please do not edit collectd config directly, but only via Luci statistics config.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 7 Feb 2017, 11:33)</p>
