					<p>I just flashed my device using the instructions here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h?rev=1296226621#migrate.from.dd-wrt.to.openwrt">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr … to.openwrt</a> (from ddwrt).&nbsp; The device appears to flash fine, but after rebooting, only the router light lights up, and it never hands out an IP via dhcp to my computer (I also tried assigning my computer a static IP, and going to 192.168.1.1, but nothing happens).</p><p>I also tried flashing the following two files via tftp:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc4/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wzr-hp-g300nh-jffs2-tftp.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … 2-tftp.bin</a><br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc4/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wzr-hp-g300nh-squashfs-tftp.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … s-tftp.bin</a></p><p>The file transfers, but when the device reboots, I still can&#039;t access my router.&nbsp; I can revert back to ddwrt via tftp, and everything works fine.</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>it definitely is J1 (the one with the 4 pins) and pin one is the one squared in for those interested, pinout found here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h</a><br />also, what is up with the bigger connector? anybody figured out what it&#039;s pinout? and what about the sd-card-slot on the back of the board?</p><p>for something completely different: did you tried the description on upgrading as described in the &quot;troubles with japanese versions&quot; and &quot;migrating from dd-wrt&quot;? not the one editing the u-boot, but the one &quot;installing dd-wrt over update&quot; and then &quot;logging in over ssh, moving image on router and installing it with that mtd-cmd&quot;? i happened to have a japanese version (and was not even able to really tftp it somehow), yet the upgrade over dd-wrt worked pretty fine - once i got stupid dd-wrt to let me ssh into it. so maybe you might want to give it a try? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>So the obvious problem is there are no network interfaces present.&nbsp; I&#039;m out of time for tonight and will try again maybe tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp; Likely it just needs the right kernel modules to work.</p><p>Ps.&nbsp; this is a release out of /trunk.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks all who posted so far about how they got openwrt on their routers.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to flash back to dd-wrt and find out what hardware is being identified, then flash the trunk back on and see why the same devices aren&#039;t being picked up.&nbsp; I&#039;ll file a bug ticket after and if I get lucky, maybe even have a patch.</p>									</div>
