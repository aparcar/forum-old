I think this is a problem for all wiki&#039;s and I don&#039;t know how those account for this. I just wanted to bring this under attention and hope there is a way to turn this dead end into a live passageway again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Where can others find older revisions?</p><p>Would have been good enough if there was a link on the page that points to older revisions, this way people could eventually co back to the revision that existed around the same date of the forum post.</p><p>For instance people who have a router with BB or AA or even older they still can have an easy way to digg up older documentation.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure there will be a reason for the removal,&nbsp; and it would have been nice if a reason was given upon removing.&nbsp; &nbsp;For the current documentation that page might no longer be appropiate.&nbsp; Still people will browse the forum pages and so they will end in a dead end street.&nbsp; &nbsp;And that&#039;s in my opinion not the best option.&nbsp; &nbsp;A simple page revision history would probably solve this??&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m trying to figure out how you dug up that page!&nbsp; In recent changes i only find the latest changes to the wiki, but i dont see page revisions for that specific page. So at this point i&#039;m already happy that older revisions are still available.&nbsp; :-)</p>									</div>
