					<p>i had alchemy firmware before. i messed with overclocking via nvram.</p><p>i used JTAG and HairyDairyMaid_WRT54G_Debrick_Utility_v48. i was able to clear the nvram and get a ping. i, then used tftp and uploaded the default linksys firmware from the linksys site. now the router won&#039;t responds to pings. I am still able to use JTAG.</p><p>I was wondering if anyone could point me in what to do next.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Taney</p>									</div>
