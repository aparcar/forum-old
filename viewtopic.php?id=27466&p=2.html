					<p>They are configured differently. If you look at Oreon for example, snapshots are much smaller in size than release builds, meaning that many packages are omitted in snapshots. Last time I tried a snapshot build, I bricked my router. Ethernet ports were not working and I could not connect to wireless as well.</p>									</div>

That is the niche for OpenWrt, and it fills it wonderfully. To remain good, we need better and better wireless drivers and for this I think regular kernel updates.

					<p>I sure hope that this, and the above comments for that matter, don&#039;t come off as a complaint about the slow release of Backfire or anything like that. We should all remember the fruits we enjoy from the important work the devs do on their spare time -- demanding releases and ridiculing the long RC cycle can quickly sap the joy and motivation that drives them to do what they do!</p><p>That being said, perhaps a lot of the complaints could be allayed by providing more info on the status of things on the front page and the wiki? Perhaps users would be more positive if they were told that Backfire releases are far between, and that for such and such wellknown hardware one should consider trunk? Maybe some info now and then about major things going on in trunk, future directions, etc?</p>									</div>

					<p>You guys can *plan* the release cycle however you want. You could *propose* this or that information about the status be relayed to users. In the end, you are at the mercy of the creative drive of the developers. If you want things done sooner, do it yourself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink"/>. Otherwise, take what is there now and use it. Myself, I always was a bit frustrated by the perfectionism in this and other F/OSS projects, as I am more inclined to get a workable piece of code, then move forward (as opposed to continually reworking that code). However, each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and *again* you are bound to the particular ideology of the developers. Being open source, YOU have the liberty to do whatever you want though, so there should be NO calls for doing things faster -- </p><p><strong>&quot;Do something! Do something!

It&#039;s all just &quot;marketing,&quot; really - what does &quot;rc&quot; (Release Candidate) mean? Or, more to the point, why are there four or five or more of them?

After all, we&#039;re still down at the double-dot level, right? 10.03.1 will be the eventual number?

BTW, none of the posts above implied that we are not appreciative of the wonderful work that the developers have done. On the contrary, almost every post conveys gratitude for the effort put into the project. This is definitely not a case of US vs THEM, and I certainly hope that the developers dont feel that way. We&#039;re all on the same team here but some of us have been waiting for quite a while for a non RC release.

					<p>Not having installed OpenWRT yet, I&#039;d also prefer some kind of &quot;release&quot;. Not that it has to be marked &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;beta&quot; or something, but an SVN tag would suffice. So that people could run e.g. backfire_11.03 and when issues arise, everybody knows which release you&#039;re running. Otherwise it&#039;d be &quot;oh, you&#039;re running the version from last Monday, try the Tuesday version, but after 12 EST&quot;. Maybe that&#039;s not the case though and issue tracking around here isn&#039;t like that, I wouldn&#039;t know, as I&#039;m new to OpenWRT. But an SVN tag would be nice, IMHO.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems like the manpower issue is the sort of thing automated testing is designed to address. Finding people with the right resources and skillset might be a challenge, though...I see there&#039;s been some discussion about this on the openwrt-devel mailing list (<a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2011-January/009067.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 09067.html</a>), but it doesn&#039;t seem like anything has caught on yet.</p><p>Probably more importantly, I&#039;m unable to locate a clear definition of what a stable OpenWRT release is. Doesn&#039;t seem to mean every known bug has been addressed, and I imagine there&#039;s more to it than simply making sure that images for various platforms build without errors. Who decides when a release is stable, and what criteria do they apply?</p>									</div>

I am thankful that we have it under the correct license, but it needs a lot of work...! And as for the Apple contribution to WebKit, they started to play around with the software-parts, that they released under the BSD-license.

					<p>The question is, why the OpenWrt devels decided to offer a stable release additionally, since trunk is already very stable, at least for me. I encountered minor bugs, which were closed very quickly, but no stability issues so far.</p><p>It&#039;s a pity that, 10.03.1 needs so long to finally get released, but it is more important that a steady development is going on in trunk.</p><p>I don&#039;t understand your problems. Please, go to Arch Linux Forum and propose a stable release: <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/">https://bbs.archlinux.org</a>/ Or better yet, demand one.</p>									</div>
