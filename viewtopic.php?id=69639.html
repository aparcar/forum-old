					<p>Hello forumers, I was wondering whether anyone could help me getting DHCP configured properly? The router does not connect to the internet while using DHCP. My computer does and this is what I&#039;ve done as a temporary workaround (and it works like a charm <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />:</p><p>1. Plug computer into the fiber switch;<br />2. Write down IP addresses aquired;<br />3. Cinfigure static IP in router with IP addresses originally obtained by the computer.</p><p>Now, the router does not connect to the internet even if I override the MAC address of the router with the MAC address of my computer. I suspect this is an error in config/Open WRT. I&#039;ve disabled ipv6 as my ISP does not support it.</p><p>Thank you for your support.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tit.elmund</strong> on 30 Jan 2017, 23:39)</p>

					<p>See the logs on the OpenWrt device, perhaps there is some info there...<br />Also, is the computer configured somehow special?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eduperez</strong> on 31 Jan 2017, 10:29)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>when you use the MAC address of the computer twice, first for the router and second for the Router, that is not good.&nbsp; You have give your computer a different MAC address, when using it behind the router.</p><p>Second, when you don&#039;t show us some logfiles or your configuration, we only can guess ....</p><br /><p>Christoph</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rj-45</strong> on 31 Jan 2017, 13:58)</p>
