					<p>i have upgraded my WRT160NL to Backfire Interim Release 1 (10.03.1). I usually use the jffs2 version and perform a factory reset but this time i thought i try the sysupgrade jffs2 version i must of ran out of space as the router is not booting anymore. Because i have the jffs2 version there is no failsafe implemented as i understand it. Is there any way i can recover my router. please provide detailed information if there is a way.</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>of course there is a way, don&#039;t be afraid. First you need a working firmware and then follow this steps:</p><p>1- You need to change the IP options (IP 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0&nbsp; gateway 192.168.1.1) and the pc directly by RJ45</p><p>2- Enter cmd (if using windows) and type PING -t 192.168.1.1 and wait</p><p>3 in another cmd navigate where you have the firmware and run&nbsp; tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT [firm_name] and press enter just when you restart the WRT160NL.</p><p>After that check if the first cmd start to receive and wait untill the router reboot. Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>i have tried your instructions but unfortunately they do not work. tftp times out, and ping also. i have tried multiple times both with pressing buttons and not pressing. the problem for me is that the dmz button does not blink. all i get is the puwer button that&#039;s blinking, followed by a short blink of all buttons after about 5 seconds and then the lan button connected blinks. </p><p>some forums said to press buttons and stuf to force tftp but it doesent seem to work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been in the same boat. The solution is weird, but it works <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>You&#039;ll have to download this file: <a href="http://dd-wrt.com/routerdb/de/download/Linksys/WRT160NL/1.0/linksys-to-ddwrt-firmware.bin/3806">http://dd-wrt.com/routerdb/de/download/ â€¦ e.bin/3806</a> (This image is specially crafted so that the WRT will accept it. Stock Linksys or OpenWRT images won&#039;t work).<br />Now:<br />1: Set your NICs IP to 192.168.1.2.<br />2: Fire up a TFTP client (I used tftpd32 (<a href="http://tftpd32.jounin.net">http://tftpd32.jounin.net</a>).<br />3: Set TFTP host to 192.168.1.1.<br />4: Select the downloaded linksys-to-ddwrt-firmware.bin<br />5: Power off from your WRT.<br />6: Power on your WRT.<br />7: Press &quot;Put&quot; in tftpd32.</p><p>Upload will commence after a few seconds, after which the WRT will reboot after ~50 seconds. You will now have a micro build of DD-WRT on your device, which can be used to flash stock Linksys firmware (direct DD-WRT to OpenWRT will fail and you&#039;ll have to repeat the above process). Once on stock Linksys firmware you can flash OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sgn</strong> on 4 Jan 2012, 03:14)</p>
