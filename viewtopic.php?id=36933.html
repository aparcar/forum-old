					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;ve bricked my tp-link mr3220 the other day while trying to install openwrt. I&#039;ve bought a CA-42 cable to try to use the serial port, but it&#039;s just not working. I&#039;ll describe everything I did, hope it won&#039;t be too long.</p><p>Firstly, I&#039;ve assembled my cable following the instructions from:</p><p> <a href="http://buffalo.nas-central.org/index.php/Use_a_Nokia_Serial_Cable_on_an_ARM9_Linkstation#Preparing_the_Cable">http://buffalo.nas-central.org/index.ph â€¦ _the_Cable</a></p><p>My cable is a CA-42, but it&#039;s a bit different because it has 6 cables (vs. 3 in the tutorial), pin &#039;2&#039; exits and is connected and pin 4 (3.3v out) is connected too.</p><p>Anyway, I followed the instructions there and apparently it worked because I was able to build a loopback cable. That is, I twisted tx and rx and could see the characters I typed in minicom echoed back.</p><p>Then I soldered tx, rx and gnd in the PCB as explained here:</p><p> <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420#serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420#serial</a></p><p>Note that I did not solder vcc, because this cable is said to be device powered (as proved by the loop back cable). I&#039;m not using a pullup resistor either.</p><p>I connect the USB cable, fire up minicom, turn on the router and noting happens. Absolutely nothing. I&#039;ve already soldered again the cables, but it just doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>Yesterday I was googling for more information on this and found about the failsafe option. This worked! I can telnet into the router, but I really would like to make the serial port to work. Within the router I did:</p><p># echo akndksad &gt;&gt; /dev/ttyS0</p><p>But did not see anything on the machine. And if I do &quot;cat /dev/ttyS0&quot; I see a continuous string of garbage.</p><p>Any ideas what&#039;s wrong and/or how to debug this? I could provide a picture of my PCB if this helps</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
