					<p>I tried everything in here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/samba">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/samba</a> to get user level access working. But Samba only works on a share with the &quot;guest_ok&quot; option. As soon as I remove that option on a share it becomes inaccessable.</p><p>In the (Windows 8) client all shares are visible. The error I get when opening the ones with user level access:<br />\\OPENWRT\shares is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. (...)</p><p>But I did all of the following:<br />- added a new user in the /etc/passwd file <br />- gave this user a Samba password using smbpasswd -a smbuser<br />- set correct permissions on the share: set owner of /shares to smbuser with read/write permissions.</p><p>Did I miss something? I&#039;ve been on this for a long time... <br />I&#039;m using trunk r37629.</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems that Windows gets confused when you switch&nbsp; between including the &quot;guest_ok&quot; and leaving it out on the same share. It correctly asks for your password on the second share (with no guests allowed), but in that case it somehow triggers a permissions issue. A reboot solves it. Although I don&#039;t know for how long it will last, requiring another reboot. We&#039;ll see.</p>									</div>
