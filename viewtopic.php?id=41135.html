					<p>Hi,<br />i want to configure my TP-Link WDR3600 to be a Client to a router which provides the internet connection.<br />I want to connect computers over LAN and Wifi to the TP-Link, so the TP-Link should Broadcast its own SSID!<br />Computers attached to the TP-Link (Lan and Wifi) should be in their own subnet.<br />Computers attached to the router which provides the internet connection shouldn&#039;t see Computers attached to the TP-Link.<br />Is that possible? Can you help me to configure my TP-Link?</p><br /><p>Thanks<br />Amaterasu</p>									</div>
