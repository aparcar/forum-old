					<p>Has someone compile a raw 802.11 packet injection like airjack (driver) for openWRT?<br />I never compiled somthing for openWRT, is it difficult or is there a tutorial online? So i can give it a try.<br />I want to send fake weak packets to protect my network. All ap&#039;s got wep accept my honeypot. By sending fake weak packets airsnort en such will calculate wrong WEP keys. Then maybe the attacker will connect to the honeypot which is the only ap not protected by wep.</p><p>thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ussx</strong> on 17 May 2005, 16:13)</p>
