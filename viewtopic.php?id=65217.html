					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m developing web interface for a RF transceiver which communicates via serial interface exposed by CDC-ACM. Communication protocol is custom made and consists of structured binary messages.</p><p>Basically I need to write command or data message to serial port and read response from port. I also need to implement interpreter for the communication protocol to compile commands and handle responses. Just an example.</p><p>When sending command </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>0x11, 0x00, 0x03</code></pre></div><p> to transceiver, it responds with</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>0x11, [length byte], 0x03, [payload bytes]</code></pre></div><br /><p>What is OpenWRT way doing it?</p><p>a) Should I develop web interface only for persisting configuration in file with help of LuCI CBI and &quot;buttons&quot; for calling external application which handles communications with the device. Of course I need to develop that external application also.<br />Should I use stdin, stdout and stderr to communicate with external application?</p><p>b) Should I implement serial read and write; and data processing in Lua and in luci-application-X package?</p>									</div>
