					<p>Hi! I&#039;m looking for a way to install gcc on my openwrt machine. I tried the following:</p><p>- copy folder [buildroot]/feeds/packages/devel/gcc to [buildroot]/package/gcc<br />- added the .config to include package_gcc<br />- make package/gcc-compile V=99</p><p>This does not work, it fails with <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>*** The command &#039;i486-openwrt-linux-uclibc-gcc -o conftest     conftest.c&#039; failed.
*** You must set the environment variable CC to a working compiler.
make[2]: *** [/usr/src/openwrt/build_dir/target-i386_uClibc-0.9.30.1/gcc-4.1.2/.configured_] Error 1</code></pre></div><p>Does anyone have a packed .ipkg with gcc for x86 or any idea how this can be done?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />&nbsp; you wish to install the tool-chain on the routerbox ? <br />or you wish to compile packages externally on the development machine.</p><p>if I want to add packages i always prefer to do&nbsp; cross compile&nbsp; it on the development box because the router box is just way too slow to do anything serious.<br />I haven&#039;t tried compiling for the GCC to run inside the router box, because the whole build envi is available on the HOST.<br />if you wish to compile any packages from outside manually or using make file then I can throw some light on it.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if a openwrt style make file is available; if its not did you create one ?</p><br /><p>hope this helps<br />Regards,<br />mohnkhan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mohnkhan</strong> on 12 Apr 2010, 13:43)</p>

					<p>Hi and thanks for your answer! I&#039;m trying to compile asterisk and some modules for it directly on the Box. The Package that comes with openwrt is not enough for me. I never tried to cross-compile asterisk itself, could you point me in the right direction? Do I have to write the (asterisk)makefile by myself? </p><p>Oh, the Box would be powerful enough (500mhz AMD geode)</p><p>The makefile for gcc is in the Folder /feeds/packages/devel/gcc</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chrizzz</strong> on 12 Apr 2010, 13:52)</p>
