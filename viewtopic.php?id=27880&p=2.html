					<p>Hi,<br/>do we have some news about the ticket opened?<br/>I have the same problem as this post.....<br/>Here my situation:<br/>=========<br/>MY box is SL2-141-i, i changed the board to RTA1025W_16 to flash it with OpenWrt (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gigaset/sl2-141-i">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gigaset/sl2-141-i</a>) and after that it seems OK.<br/>But i need to create VLANs to use 1 ethernet physical port as WAN. No need to use anymore the ADSL telephone port. WLAN is OK.</p><p>Now, i was working a lot trying to create a correct /etc/config/network file (lots of docs in web), but everytime i cannot make vlan working.<br/>Then i noticed in/proc/switch/eth0 dir:<br/>--&gt; vlan_enable=0 ??<br/>--&gt; xxx file (don&#039;t remember) says this is a adm6996 chip.... --&gt; not sure if there are some drivers missing<br/>--&gt; robotswitch module is OK</p><p>Not sure how is the architecture of this platform, i mean, if the internal switch is on eth0 or eth1... btw, i have only eth0 in /proc.</p><p>==================</p><p>Thanks for some suggestions and any kind of helps!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Possible reason for low interest is limited hardware, performance capabilities of this generation devices.</p><p>Last I checked, OpenWRT itself was not prepared for proper user experience, easily wasting users&#039; time if they tried to use it with the nice OpenWRT features such as the web interface, firewall, packages.</p><p>If features are enabled, allowed - it should be made safe - more testing and fixes towards user experience would be needed.</p><p>I do not see a reason for such projects to be deliberately geeky (unless we keep evil and want to limit the user base or waste people&#039;s time when they come across a technical difficulty built in the Open Source software by means of non-software-management.)</p><p>In the WiKi article I posted, I show that there is not enough space on the flash, and thus removing of packages. <br/><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netcomm/nb6plus4w">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netcomm/nb6plus4w</a></p><br/><br/><br/><p>People are interested in switch functionality to use such devices for VLAN tagging switch next to a router on a stick as well as next to a Wi-Fi AP L2 only devices. As well as L2 separation.</p><p>Another use is - unmanaged switch with a pingable IP for monitoring.</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe OpenWRT devs should provide a small image probably Backfire based. Hopefully one that is easy to flash from Web and includes updated CFE, web interface such as Luci, and full BCM5325 switch support!</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
