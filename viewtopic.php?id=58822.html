					<p>Hi All,<br />I am new for this openWRT and i am interested in Audio on router.<br />I know there is GStreamer, FFMpeg, ALSA packages.<br />Just want to know the complete Audio Architecture on openWRT, e.g. how it communicate from user space to kernel space(it may be GStreamer+ffmepg), but i am not sure much about this.<br />Is there any tiny alsa? is there any HAL layer?Is it support H/W decoding, encoding?Is there any APP which is for PCM playback or non-pcm playback?</p><p>If possible, please share some document related to this?</p><p>Thanks<br />Ajay</p>									</div>

					<p>Complex topic.</p><p>Most routers do not have native audio hardware.<br />This is because current target SoC not supporting it due to market reasons and/or engineering audio circuits with radio/RF circuits.</p><p>You have to search for some forum posts regarding &quot;I2S&quot; / audio codec <br />and ask there for documentation of the projects like <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50512">airmusic nw11</a> or on projects which use OpenWrt firmware like carambola2 <a href="http://www.8devices.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=858">I2S on carambola2@8devices forum</a></p><p>&quot;normal&quot; Audio in OpenWrt is like:<br />- Linux Kernel provides &quot;SoC&quot; Audio (omap and afaik some sunxi or imx have these) or audio via attached USB Sound Card<br />- run alsa<br />- test with aplay<br />- mpd for playing all different sound formats<br />- use some app / program to control the mpd server running on router (console client, UI client, android app ...)</p><p>If you use Bluetooth devices you have to use pulseaudio since direct ALSA is not supported in newer versions - see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/wiki/bluetooth.audio">http://wiki.openwrt.org/wiki/bluetooth.audio</a></p>									</div>

					<p>In trunk, sunxi will get an audio driver with the 4.1 bump in the next few days. An i2s driver will likely also be made available, but that&#039;s experimental.</p>									</div>
