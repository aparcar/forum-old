					<p>Hi there</p><p>I&#039;ve set up a WDS network using WPA encryption. The devices are ranging from WRT54G 1.1 up to 2.2 and WRT54GLs. When this network was running WEP encryption it was working flawlessly. I could reboot whichever router and the whole network would then be rebuilt the way I intended it to be set up. When doing WPA encryption, however, this has all changed:</p><p>If I try to reboot one of the &quot;leaf&quot; APs, the link between it and the &quot;hub&quot; AP won&#039;t get reestablished. To get it reestablished I have to reboot the hub AP as well, which can be quite the hassle. Sometimes it&#039;s not enough just to do one reboot, I may have to do several before the link is reestablished.</p><p>The network is set up as follows:</p><p>Wired network ---- AP #1 (hub AP) |---- AP #2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|---- AP #3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|---- AP #4</p><p>All APs are set up pretty much identical, using WhiteRussian 0.9, apart from wl0_wds and different setting for transmit power. lan_proto is set to dhcpclient, so the br0 interface should get its IP from DHCP.</p><p>I see both stations when doing wl scan, so the radios are seemingly working.</p><br /><p>Can someone please shed some light on the whole WDS with WPA encryption thing, because it&#039;s certainly not working for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mflage</strong> on 24 Jul 2007, 18:34)</p>

					<p>Well, I don&#039;t know much about WDS but one thing I noticed about your post was you mentioned differing transmit powers.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read changing the transmit power will not do much for your leaf AP&#039;s, as the connection is only changing on one side.&nbsp; The leaf AP&#039;s need stronger antennas to benefit from the increased transmit power.</p><p>If I was trying to complete something like this, I would worry mainly about the hub and one leaf until you can get them to network flawlessly.&nbsp; Then work the other two out.&nbsp; Perhaps on your leaf disabling or commenting out dhcp in the dnsmasq.conf would fix your problem?</p><p>So what you&#039;re saying is you are able to network a hub and leaf together, it just takes a while for them to connect? Perhaps turning the transmit power down to standard would fix this?</p><p>Perhaps setting the leafs as a static IP would help, as well.&nbsp; Sorry I&#039;m not too much help but thought I&#039;d throw out some ideas.&nbsp; You never know...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using different antennas on each side.</p><p>At the hub node I have a 7 dBi omni, and on the other sites I&#039;m using 12 dBi yagis - thus setting a lower transmit power on them. I may be wrong about this, but I don&#039;t think this should influence anything..?</p><p>What I&#039;ve figured out so far is that when introducing new APs to the WDS network, I have to reboot the hub node to get all nodes back online again. So it may seem like there&#039;s some issues with this node. I will try to replace it tomorrow and see what happens. Will update this post after I&#039;ve done this test.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I can confirm this issue. I have 3 WRT54GL, 2 of them connect to main unit, the &quot;hub&quot;. I use WPA. If a &quot;leaf&quot; WRT is rebooted the WDS connection is not re-established. Rebooting the &quot;hub&quot; does the trick, sometimes I also have to reboot the other &quot;leaf&quot; device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Since WR is no longer being supported (or updated except for serious issues), you may have better luck with kamikaze.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences with WR but that doesn&#039;t mean the occasional bug won&#039;t pop up.&nbsp; Submit a dev ticket and hopefully they will point you in the right direction.</p>									</div>
