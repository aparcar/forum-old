					<p>As you may have heard, the NSA has had some success in <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/inside-the-nsa-s-war-on-internet-security-a-1010361.html">cracking Secure Shell (SSH) connections</a>. To respond to these risks, a guide written by Stribika tries to help you make your shell as robust as possible. The two main concepts are to make the crypto harder and make stealing keys impossible. So prepare a cup of coffee and read the tutorial carefully to see what could be improved in your configuration. Stribika gives also some extra security tips: don&#039;t install what you don&#039;t need (as any code line can introduce a bug), use the kind of open source code that has actually been reviewed, keep your software up to date, and use exploit mitigation technologies.</p><p><a href="https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html">https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/s â€¦ shell.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>katananja</strong> on 8 Jan 2015, 21:05)</p>
