					<p>I&#039;m having issues with the router serving up its IPv6 address as a DNS server, which is conflicting with the primary DNS server on the LAN which has only an IPv4 address.</p><p>Here are the symptoms of my problem:</p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Running Barrier Breaker (14.07, r42625) on Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H.&nbsp; In a lab environment, I have just this router and a Windows 8.1 Pro laptop. Details of the production environment are given further down below.</p></li><li><p>On the router, in /etc/dhcp I have the following directives:<br />option dhcpv6 &#039;disabled&#039;<br />option ra &#039;disabled&#039;</p></li><li><p>I perform &#039;ipconfig /release&#039; on the laptop.</p></li><li><p>I perform &#039;ipconfig /release6&#039; on the laptop.</p></li><li><p>I reboot the laptop, and when I do an &#039;ipconfig /all&#039;, I see the IPv6 address of the router as the primary DNS server.</p></li></ol><p>So this is all the lab environment. I don&#039;t want the router&#039;s IPv6 address served up to the client computer.&nbsp; </p><p>Where this is wreaking havoc is in the production environment where we have a Windows Server 2012 R2 acting as DNS server and DHCP server (due to Active Directory integration).&nbsp; The DHCP server has an IPv4 scope defined and option 23 under IPv6 set (Option 23 - DNS Recursive Name Server IPV6 Address List ).&nbsp; I would still like to keep the router as a DNS forwarder if possible for the Windows Server.&nbsp; Hence, I would prefer not switching off DNS completely.</p><p>So, any client machine attached to the LAN gets its proper IPv4 address and IPv4 DNS server from the Windows Server machine.&nbsp; However, it also gets the IPv6 DNS server from the OpenWrt router.&nbsp; Since this router doesn&#039;t know about the internal sub-domain, it resolves the address incorrectly.</p><p>What I want is that the OpenWrt router not hand out its IPv6 address as a DNS server.&nbsp; I have tried to work through the &#039;dnsmasq&#039; and &#039;dhcp&#039; documentation, but I am stumped.</p><p>The end result is that because the sub-domain is resolved incorrectly, client computers cannot join the domain and domain users are unable to log in.</p><p>Any suggestions on recommended best practices and a resolution to this problem would be most appreciated.</p><p>advTHANKSance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, I omitted to give a couple more testing data points:</p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>I also disabled the DHCP pool on the router, using &quot;option ignore &#039;1&#039;&quot; in &#039;/etc/dhcp&#039;.</p></li><li><p>I further did an &#039;ipconfig /renew&#039; with full expectation that it should fail, which it did.</p></li><li><p>*However*, after a further &#039;ipconfig /all&#039; under DNS servers, the IPv6 address of the router is now shown, even though no IP address not IPv4 DNS server were listed!</p></li></ol><p>So even with DHCP switched off, somehow the router is handing out its IPv6 address as a viable DNS server.</p>									</div>
