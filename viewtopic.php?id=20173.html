					<p>Hi,<br />I have gotten one of these old routers and thought I could put it at use with OpenWRT. Unfortunately it seems that there is no support for it since it is based on a Realtek chip. Recently I came by this site <a href="http://midge.vlad.org.ua/wiki/Main">http://midge.vlad.org.ua/wiki/Main</a> which seems to have a fork of OpenWRT which supports the Realtek chip, any possibility that it might get merged back into OpenWRT so that this router is officially supported by OpenWRT? Thanks.</p>									</div>
