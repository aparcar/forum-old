# Nodogsplash Configuration File
#

# Parameter: GatewayInterface
# Default: NONE
#
# GatewayInterface is not autodetected, has no default, and must be set here.
# Set GatewayInterface to the interface on your router
# that is to be managed by Nodogsplash.
# Typically br0 for the wired and wireless lan on OpenWrt White Russian.
# May be br-lan on OpenWrt Kamikaze.
#
GatewayInterface br-wifi

# FirewallRuleSet: authenticated-users
#
# Control access for users after authentication.
# These rules are inserted at the beginning of the
# FORWARD chain of the router&#039;s filter table, and
# apply to packets that have come in to the router
# over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# have authenticated with Nodogsplash, and that are
# destined to be routed through the router.  The rules are
# considered in order, and the first rule that matches
# a packet applies to it.
# If there are any rules in this ruleset, an authenticated
# packet that does not match any rule is rejected.
# N.B.: This ruleset is completely independent of
# the preauthenticated-users ruleset.
#
FirewallRuleSet authenticated-users {

 # You may want to open access to a machine on a local
 # subnet that is otherwise blocked (for example, to
 # serve a redirect page; see RedirectURL).  If so,
 # allow that explicitly here, e.g:
 #  FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 192.168.254.254

 # Your router may have several interfaces, and you
 # probably want to keep them private from the GatewayInterface.
 # If so, you should block the entire subnets on those interfaces, e.g.:
   # FirewallRule allow to 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
   # FirewallRule block to 10.0.0.0/8

 # Typical ports you will probably want to open up include
 # 53 udp and tcp for DNS,
 # 80 for http,
 # 443 for https,
 # 22 for ssh:
    FirewallRule allow tcp port 53    
    FirewallRule allow udp port 53

#
# Control access for users before authentication.
# These rules are inserted in the PREROUTING chain
# of the router&#039;s nat table, and in the

# router over the GatewayInterface from MAC addresses that
# are not on the BlockedMACList or TrustedMACList,
# are *not* authenticated with Nodogsplash.  The rules are
# considered in order, and the first rule that matches

# authenticated-users
# preauthenticated-users
# users-to-router
# trusted-users
# trusted-users-to-router
#
# For each of these, an EmptyRuleSetPolicy can be specified.
# An EmptyRuleSet policy applies to a FirewallRuleSet if the
# FirewallRuleSet is missing from this configuration file,
# or if it exists but contains no FirewallRules.
#
# The possible values of an EmptyRuleSetPolicy are:
# allow  -- packets are accepted
# block  -- packets are rejected
# passthrough -- packets are passed through to pre-existing firewall rules
#
# Default EmptyRuleSetPolicies are set as follows:
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy authenticated-users passthrough
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy preauthenticated-users block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy users-to-router block
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users allow
# EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users-to-router allow


# Parameter: GatewayName
# Default: NoDogSplash
#
# Set  GatewayName to the name of your gateway.  This value
# will be available as variable $gatewayname in the splash page source

# If none is supplied, the value &quot;NoDogSplash&quot; is used.
#
# GatewayName NoDogSplash

# Parameter: GatewayAddress
# Default: Discovered from GatewayInterface
#
# This should be autodetected on an OpenWRT system, but if not:

# server listens on.
#
GatewayAddress 192.168.6.1

# Parameter: ExternalInterface
# Default: Autodetected from /proc/net/route
#
# This should be autodetected on a OpenWRT system, but if not:

# Parameter: GatewayPort
# Default: 2050
#
# Nodogsplash&#039;s own http server uses GatewayAddress as its IP address.

# Parameter: AuthenticateImmediately
# Default: no
#
# Set to yes (or true or 1), to immediately authenticate users
# who make a http port 80 request on the GatewayInterface (that is,
# do not serve a splash page, just redirect to the user&#039;s request,
# or to RedirectURL if set).
#
# AuthenticateImmediately no

# Parameter: MACMechanism
# Default: block
#
# Either block or allow.
# If &#039;block&#039;, MAC addresses on BlockedMACList are blocked from

# If &#039;allow&#039;, MAC addresses on AllowedMACList are allowed to
# authenticate, and all other (non-trusted) MAC&#039;s are blocked.
#
# MACMechanism block

# Parameter: BlockedMACList
# Default: none
#
# Comma-separated list of MAC addresses who will be completely blocked
# from the GatewayInterface.  Ignored if MACMechanism is allow.

#
# TrustedMACList 00:00:CA:FE:BA:BE, 00:00:C0:01:D0:0D


# Parameter: PasswordAuthentication
# Default: no
# Set to yes (or true or 1), to require a password matching
# the Password parameter to be supplied when authenticating.

#
#TrafficControl yes

# Parameter: DownloadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum download
# speed to the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 768 kbit
# download speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 384.
# A value of 0 means no download limiting is done.
#
#DownloadLimit 2048

# Parameter: UploadLimit
# Default: 0
#
# If TrafficControl is enabled, this sets the maximum upload
# speed from the GatewayInterface, in kilobits per second.
# For example if you have an ADSL connection with 128 kbit
# upload speed, and you want to allow about half of that
# bandwidth for the GatewayInterface, set this to 64.
# A value of 0 means no upload limiting is done.
#
# UploadLimit 64

# Parameter: GatewayIPRange
# Default: 0.0.0.0/0
#
# By setting this parameter, you can specify a range of IP addresses

#
# $&lt;BinVoucher&gt; auth_voucher &lt;mac&gt; &lt;voucher&gt;
#
# BinVoucher must point to a program that will be called as described above.
# The call is expected to output the number of seconds the client
# is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the
# authentification request to be rejected.
# The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:
# &lt;seconds&gt; &lt;download&gt; &lt;upload&gt;
#
# BinVoucher &quot;/bin/myauth&quot;

# Parameter: ForceVoucher
# Default: no

#
# Enable pre-authentication support.
# Pass the MAC of a client to a command line call before the splash page
# would be send:
#
# $&lt;BinVoucher&gt; auth_status &lt;mac&gt;
#
# The call is expected to output the number of seconds the client
# is to be authenticated. Zero or negative seconds will cause the
# splash page to be displayed.
# The output may contain a user specific download and upload limit in KBit/s:

					<p>Fixed. TP-Link TL-WDR4300 Openwrt 14</p><p>I&#039;m writing this in case anyone else comes looking for the information and isn&#039;t used to ssh. don&#039;t be offended <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>First, I used failsafe to start completely over. As i realized that I had created an interface that couldn&#039;t talk to the wan. I realized this because the openwrt nodogsplash howto says to disable the built-in firewall. well that is a mistake, as (atleast version 14) seems to use iptables. </p><p>I plugged the TPLink, via the wan port, into a client port of my home router. Login and do set your password. With this reset using failsafe (it wasn&#039;t my first) the ability to ssh and use the web interface via my home network didn&#039;t work immediately. I had to add firewall rules to allow it. I found that odd because i&#039;ve reset a few times now and everytime it worked without me doing anything. with that said, once you do that follow these steps. </p><br /><p>1. Goto Network &gt; Wifi and created a new AP wifi and assigned it to a custom interface (last option) i named mine glan. <br />- i named the wifi ssid guest. <br />- I changed nothing else, no security (duh it&#039;s a guest wifi connection)<br />2. I then went to the interfaces tab and edited glan. <br />-make it a static ip setup and give it an ip in an unused subnet. i used 192.168.4.1 and subnet 255.255.255.0<br />- i changed nothing else on the interface glan. <br />3. Firewall - i made my new glan interface match the setup for the lan interface, which is to allow traffic from glan to wan &amp; wan6<br />4. edit /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf via ssh. <br />- to edit the file connect via ssh and type in: vi /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf<br />- hit the letter i (you&#039;ll notice an uppercase I appears in the lower left hand side of the screen, this means your in edit mode for vi)<br />- I set my GatewayInterface to wlan0 (because that is what my gn radio was assigned by the system. <br />&nbsp; - -if you have trouble finding this, use ssh and type in netstat -r. In mine i see that network 192.168.4.0 is using wlan0 device. <br />- once you make this change, hit ESC. then hit : and type in wq (this tells vi to write then quit)</p><p>5. now go back to the web interface. Goto System &gt; Startup<br />- find nodogsplash and click the button that says &quot;disabled&quot;.&nbsp; It will refresh and now say &quot;enable&quot;. This means no dogsplash will start on boot. <br />- you can now hit the start button. however mine had the issue where i had to start... then hit the restart button. for good measure I went back to my ssh session and typed in /etc/init.d/nodogsplash start then hit enter<br />- My preference is just to reboot the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Odd because from the initial flash until this reset it worked via the wan... however I made changes like mad. So it&#039;s possible I did something and didn&#039;t make a note. </p><p>Something else I found odd. An article comparing ddwrt openwrt and tomato claimed ddwrt and tomato were easier for noobs.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s me but ddwrt is overwhelming and I&#039;m an IT veteran.
