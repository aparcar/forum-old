					<p>I&#039;m just experimenting with an ASUS wl-500g Deluxe router.</p><p>It can use an external USB stick, and according to UsbStorageHowto on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto</a> - it is possible to boot from the USB stick.</p><p>Unfortunately, &quot;4.2. How do I boot from the USB device&quot; describes how to boot from an ext3-formatted USB device.</p><p>As originally openwrt uses jffs2 as its primary image, I thought it would be best to use jffs2 on an external USB device (to gain some space).</p><p>How can I format an external USB device with jffs2 filesystem (and use it as root as a next step)?</p><p>I tried playing with mkfs.jffs2 on my PC, but I&#039;m not sure how to create a filesystem and put it for example on a 256 MB USB-stick.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, I guess that the thinking is correct, but it would be impossible to do so on these tiny routers.</p><p>It appears that to mount a jffs2 image that is 256 MB big you would need 256 MBs of RAM...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,<br />I use OpenWGT for my WGT634U ^^,<br />and this thingy can actually boot from the usb stick, which is kinda cool!<br />^.^<br />Ok, I have formated my 128Mb Stick with ext3,<br />which works perfectly.</p><p>How they do that, I dunno, check their source?</p><p>Nico</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah I know, booting form a ext3-formatted USB stick is easy, just read the documentation <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>What I want to do is to squeeze some more data from a USB-stick and to use a compressed filesystem.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is only one filesystem taht supports compression in Linux: jffs2.</p><p>There is also &quot;compFUSEd&quot; - <a href="http://parallel.vub.ac.be/~johan/compFUSEd/">http://parallel.vub.ac.be/~johan/compFUSEd/</a> - with that you can use compression on any filesystem.</p><p>It uses FUSE, and there is a fuse module for openwrt - so I wonder if compFUSEd could be built for openwrt?</p>									</div>
