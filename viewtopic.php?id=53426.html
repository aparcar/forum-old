					<p>No, VoIP is not a magic way for making free calls to PSTN. You will need to connect to some SIP provider for making calls to &quot;normal phones&quot; (but SIP-to-SIP usually free). Or make your own gateway and make calls through it, using your own phone line.</p><p>In short: no.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>_DS_</strong> on 21 Oct 2014, 22:22)</p>

					<p>Get an ATA (analog telephone adapter), such as an Obihai device, and then sign up for a SIP provider. There are very cheap services for this if you do some hunting. Some can also handle SMS. Also look at google voice if you&#039;re in the USA</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 21 Oct 2014, 23:49)</p>
