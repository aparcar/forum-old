					<p>I&#039;ve been messing around with OpenWrt on a WNR3500L (wl driver) and and connections from wifi to lan stalls after a few kb.</p><p>If I do this, where &#039;zero&#039; is wired and I&#039;m on wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh zero &#039;cat /dev/zero&#039; &gt;&gt; test</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ll get a few kb transferred then it will just stop. Odd thing is this only happens between wireless and lan; lan to lan and wireless to wan both work just fine.</p><p>Anyone know what&#039;s going on?</p><p>EDIT: Further testing shows the problem only happens on lan -&gt; wireless transfers and not wireless -&gt; lan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ipha</strong> on 24 Feb 2013, 09:19)</p>

					<p>Bump with more info:</p><p>Did some more test and lan to wireless connections get cut off after exactly 1024 bytes</p><p>I&#039;ve also used tcpdump to capture the exchange. Here I&#039;m trying to transfer a 1MB file via netcat.</p><p>This is captured from the router:<br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=EZfnnKuE">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=EZfnnKuE</a><br />And this is captured from the wireless client:<br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=CU6gLHpJ">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=CU6gLHpJ</a><br />(2: wired, 218: wireless)</p><p>Anyone know what I should look at next?

					<p>Probably nothing to do with your problem, but I have seen FTP transfers fail/hang after a set number of bytes when the far end can&#039;t get exclusive control of the file being replaced.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, this happens no matter where I write the data. I don&#039;t think the client is at fault.</p><p>EDIT: wireless &lt;-&gt; wireless connections are unaffected.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ipha</strong> on 27 Feb 2013, 21:44)</p>
