					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m running an archer c7 v2 behind a router. I disabled stuff on the archer (wan, wan6, nat/firewall, dnsmasq, ipv6-prefix, vlan2), added switch ports 1 and 6 to vlan1, and set a static address for the br-lan. It seems to work well, but I would like confirmation or clarification on some things.</p><p>First, does that setup sound sane? I&#039;ve been trying to find information on such a configuration. The openwrt &quot;dumb AP&quot; article seems close, but doesn&#039;t quite match the archer setup.</p><p>Using swconfig, I can map switch port 1 to 5 to the physical RJ-45 jacks. Are the other two ports the two wireless radios?</p><p>Based on the last question, what are the original two vlans for? One radio plus the lan ports for vlan1? The other radio and the wan port for vlan2?</p><p>I think eth1 is the switch. What is eth0?</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces

					<p>Installed build 41846 from trunk on my Archer C7 v2 and it needed a little fiddling to get things right.</p><p>Firstly, for some reason kmod-ath10k is not in the image, I had to install it via opkg.<br />Secondly, patch 41757 is not working or not included as I was still getting the wrong MAC address and the board.bin was clearly the default one from the package.&nbsp; I just copy/pasted the code from patch 41757 into a script and ran it as follows:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#!/bin/sh<br />. /lib/functions.sh<br />. /lib/functions/system.sh</p><p>dd if=/dev/mtdblock2 bs=1 skip=20480 count=2116 of=/tmp/ath10k-board.bin<br />local mac<br />mac=$(macaddr_add $(cat /sys/class/net/eth1/address) -2)</p><p>dd if=/dev/mtdblock4 bs=1 skip=20480 count=6 of=/tmp/ath10k-board.bin<br />macaddr_2bin $mac &gt;&gt; /tmp/ath10k-board.bin<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock4 bs=1 skip=20492 count=2104 &gt;&gt; /tmp/ath10k-board.bin</p><p>[ -f /tmp/ath10k-board.bin ] || {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return<br />}<br />cmp -s /tmp/ath10k-board.bin /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA988X/hw2.0/board.bin || {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cp /tmp/ath10k-board.bin /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA988X/hw2.0/board.bin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rm /tmp/ath10k-board.bin<br />}</p></blockquote></div><p>Fortunately patch 41756 does seem to be applied so once I rebooted it ignored the missing otp, pulled in the now correct board.bin and so far appears to have perfectly functional VHT80 for the first time on OpenWRT for me.</p><p>[NOTE]<br />Delete /etc/config/wireless after rebooting and then run &quot;wifi-detect &gt;/etc/config/wireless&quot;.&nbsp; This will make sure both WiFi adapters are assigned correctly.&nbsp; Also, luci does not support 802.11ac yet so its best to manually edit this file instead.</p><p>I only have a Galaxy Note 3 to test on but I am getting over 200Mbit throughput in both directions according to iperf.&nbsp; It does seem to fluctuate by around 30-60Mbit compared to the stock firmware but its still a good speed.&nbsp; Its hard to test much beyond iperf as Android is not exactly optimised for these kinds of speed.</p><p>There does seem to be a bug in ath10k though, it is not reporting the link speeds properly.&nbsp; In fact the link speed is not changing at all in the UI or station dump, it was saying 6Mbit tx bitrate even when I got 237Mbit throughput to my phone.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe trunk should work fine for everything except 5Ghz WiFi which is not supported on the v1 in ANY build, unless you swap out the PCIe card.</p><p><strong>As for the v2:</strong></p><p>Been using it as my main WiFi both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz now for 24 hours and so far its perfectly stable.&nbsp; In fact, I haven&#039;t had the Galaxy Note 3 WiFi fail yet which it ALWAYS does on 5Ghz sooner or later.</p><p>[UPDATE]</p><p>Another couple of days use and I have only seen the Note 3 drop WiFi once and it ACTUALLY dropped, rather than what it used to do which was stop all data transfer and me have to manually force it to disconnect/reconnect.</p><p>Also done some further iperf testing after mounting the C7 on the wall and the speed I am getting now is near enough identical to the stock firmware, so very pleased there.&nbsp; If only I had a three stream device to test I would be REALLY curious what speeds I could get.</p><p>Interestingly even my 2.4Ghz signal seems improved compared to the Buffalo WHR-HP-G300NH.&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t heard any complaints from my mum (who is stuck on 2.4Ghz) since the swap as the Buffalo had been crashing the WiFi lately, I think it may be failing due to the recent heatwave.</p>									</div>

					<p>Strange thing is it works with VHT80, and it did before my last upgrade, but not with encryption. What happens is the PC reaches the router, prompts for password, I enter it and know it&#039;s right, and I get prompted again for a password. It&#039;s refusing to accept my password. I&#039;ll try VHT40, but I hate downgrading the router capabilities.</p><p>UPDATE: Just tried VHT40.

					<p>Was anything useful logged to indicate why it&#039;s failing, I remember having issues with a Mac on 5Ghz previously as it was trying to connect using the old a rather than the an N client, which failed because of something I&#039;d disabled. This was on an older Tp-Link device, so probably not your issue, but the logs may explain what&#039;s going on</p><p>I don&#039;t think 14.07 RC2 is going to help, it seems to be based on r41580, 5Ghz was broken between r40800 and r41755 for our devices, it&#039;s only been working for the last 2 weeks so I&#039;d not be surprised if there are a few more bugs to fix</p>									</div>
