					<p>I&#039;m a new developer trying to find my way around the Barrier Breaker source tree a bit.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say that I want to find the correct spot in the code after a beacon frame is received, to examine its fields using my own logic.&nbsp; Could anybody give me a pointer to the spot (or function, or file)?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen this kind of information elsewhere.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; If I&#039;ve missed an existing resource with this level of information, my apologies, and a pointer to such would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Beacon Frame are probably handled in the Kernel. However Kernel drivers are not used for wireless.</p><p>- OpenWrt uses newer/&quot;future&quot; drivers: the mac80211 package created from some wireless development repository (afaik it should be wireless-testing : <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git">http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel … esting.git</a> )<br />compare the date of the package to the version in that tree; these drivers are then backported to run with older Kernels (see backport project for details) - and the output of the backport process is used as new driver for old Kernel versions</p><p>- these drivers are then heavily patched (see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/kernel/mac80211/patches">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/p … 11/patches</a> )</p><p>build_dir/target ...../linux-(arch)/compat-wireless-(version/ should contain the driver sources if you built OpenWrt from source</p><p>There is some information of the wireless subsystem - <br /><a href="http://www.campsmur.cat/files/mac80211_intro.pdf">http://www.campsmur.cat/files/mac80211_intro.pdf</a><br />has some codepaths but wireless subsystem is evolving quite fast and there might be differences between hardware / handling of packets between firmware and non-firmware drivers for example</p><p>PS: Some older drivers do not use NL80211 drivers</p><p>afaik ath9k should support very verbose wireless debugging</p>									</div>

					<p>In the past three weeks I&#039;ve become comfortable with building my own OpenWRT loads, downloading them to my target (TP-Link WDR4300, Atheros 9xxx chipset), switching back and forth between vendor and OpenWRT firmwares, and understanding the many networking options available through LuCI.&nbsp; Though I have more information now, the task in my first post is still in front of me (code for logging a few fields in each beacon frame heard, for me probably with ath_dbg (?)).</p><p>Thanks zloop for your advice.</p><p>To confirm, you are recommending that I look at the source in the directory</p><p>barrier_breaker/build_dir/target-mips_34kc_uClibc-0.9.33.2/<br />linux-ar71xx_generic/compat-wireless-2014-05-22/drivers/net/<br />wireless/ath/ath9k</p><p>Is that correct?&nbsp; &nbsp;(dir string broken across several lines)</p><p>Could someone familiar with this code perhaps provide a clue regarding which source files would be the best ones to study and modify (roughly 100 candidates in the dir).</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
