					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have 2 routers, and pinging a computer behind the 2nd router recently stopped working for one computer, but still works for another. It worked flawlessly for weeks, and I didn&#039;t change anything.</p><p>Pinging all computers from the 2nd router works. I have no firewall or routing or any other rules that are different for computers within the same subnet. </p><p>How do I diagnose this? Here&#039;s my network topology:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>WAN-&gt;  Router1       -&gt; Router2        -&gt; Computers
       192.168.1.1      192.168.1.211
                        192.168.2.1    -&gt; 192.168.2.202,  203</code></pre></div><p>Router1 has the following rule to let it ping computers in the Router 2 subnet:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config route
    option interface lan
    option target 192.168.2.0
    option netmask 255.255.255.0
    option gateway 192.168.1.211</code></pre></div><p>from Router1: </p><p>ping 192.168.2.203 succeeds<br />traceroute 192.168.2.203 shows hop 1: 192.168.1.211 , hop 2: 192.168.2.203, success<br />ping 192.168.2.202 fails (just hangs)<br />traceroute 192.168.2.202 shows hop 1: 192.168.1.211 , but freezes on hop 2</p><p>from Router2:</p><p>ping 192.168.2.203 succeeds<br />ping 192.168.2.202 succeeds<br />traceroutes succeed<br />firewall is disabled</p><br /><p>How on Earth is this possible? Rebotting the routers doesn&#039;t work. Both have OpenWRT installed, and this worked for a while before failing yesterday. How do I diagnose this? Any help or suggestions would be very much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks!<br />Sergiy</p><p>[ADDED] As a data point, when I ssh from Router1 into Router2, it happens instantly using 192.168.<strong>1.211</strong>, but it takes 10-20 seconds to connect using 192.168.<strong>2.1</strong>, which indicates a problem with Router1&lt;-&gt;Router2 connection. However after this initial delay, everything else works very fast, and I can ping everywhere from Router2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>migdalskiy</strong> on 27 Sep 2011, 23:46)</p>

					<p>FIXED.</p><p>Apparently the firewall on the computer somehow got to the state when it blocked ICMP packets from Router1, but not from Router2. I have no idea why it worked for a while, and then stopped, without me touching any settings at all, but that seems to have been the problem . After unblocking ICMP in the firewall on the computer in question, I can ping it fine.</p><p>Thanks,<br />S</p>									</div>
