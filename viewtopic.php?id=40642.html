If all you need is standard IPV4 internet access, I think it will<br />do this nicely. But, then the standard firmware will also do this.</p><p>I bought two of these, and I have found several restrictions with current Openwrt. Channels 12 and 13 are not available in Europe, IPV6 does not work very well, and some other things, like LAN file/device sharing do not work.</p><p>If you need to bridge, it will do this as well. I used my pair as a WDS link between two buildings, one set as AP + WDS and the other as CLIENT + WDS. THis worked (with the above restrictions) Again, the tp-link firmware worked OK too. </p><p>When I restored the firmware from Openwrt to TPlink, I bricked one router. I do not know the exact cause, I used the identical procedure for both.</p>									</div>

Possibly this is a generic bug because other multicasts do not get through also, such as USB memory sharing. I have not tested ALL possible configs, but used WDS bridging, LAN A -&gt; 841ND -&gt; WIFI -&gt; 841 ND -&gt; LAN B, and I could not get my computers in different buildings to talk to each other. I used A.A. beta2 image + kmod-ipv6 . I tested many other options, but nothing worked. It seems with the changes in multicast routing, the bridge code in linux is NOT transparent any more, and that if you want to use multicast addresses you have to register them. Probably someone has a solution to this, but to me it just looks *broken* right now. A lot has happened since I used Linux bridging, back in 2002-2003.....</p><p>I verified this is the problem, since adding a &quot;static neighbor&quot; at each end nodes could talk. (this is the IPV6 &quot;ARP&quot; replacement...)</p><p>Other routers with Openwrt *might* behave differently, but my investigations indicate this is generic....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gulweb</strong> on 24 Nov 2012, 22:14)</p>
