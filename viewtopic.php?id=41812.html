					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve decided to take the plunge and have a play with OpenWRT as I&#039;ve been frustrated with the limited features of off-the-shelf routers and I&#039;ve had a fair few headaches running Smoothwall on a dedicated Atom box, plus I&#039;d like to use a lower power device.</p><p>I&#039;ve bought myself a DG834G v3 from ebay after having a look at the options available and thinking it was a good price / feature / support balance, and all looked straightforward. It&#039;s arrived and I&#039;m having some trouble getting going, can someone give me a push in the right direction, please, as I think I&#039;m very close to success.</p><p>Following the advice <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/netgear/dg834gv3#installing.openwrt">here</a> I&#039;ve downgraded the Netgear firmware to get wget. Despite the Wiki reccomending using a pre-buit image, I found it very hard to track down which one is the correct / best one for this router - Am I missing something obvious? Eventually <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33887">this post</a> pointed me in the direction of<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar7/openwrt-ar7-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … uashfs.bin</a> which has gone up and booted. However telnet connections time out and pings failed. I&#039;ve now soldered on the required serial connector and the device seems to be functioning correctly - I&#039;ve confirmed that the IP address is appropriate, however I can&#039;t ping my laptop from the router either. The LEDs flash appropriately when I initiate a ping from either end, and the trasmitted packet count increases, however the other end does not seem to respond, and the recieved packets from either end do not incriment.</p><p>I notice that the documentation in the OldWiki suggests that the Ethernet was broken when it was written, but I&#039;ve not found out how old the oldwiki is. Is this still a current bug? One that I need a newer version than the 10.03.1 release for?</p><p>Any pointers as to how to get round this would be much appreciated, please! My research seems to be going round in circles by now...</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>--Toby W.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been through the documentation again, but I&#039;m still stuck. Any pointers would be much appreciated, as at the moment I don&#039;t seem to have many options for progressing. The router is listed as supported in the hardware list, so I presume I&#039;m not the only one with this device - it even has it&#039;s own section of the forum, though that seems to be obsolete.</p><p>The only way I can see to progress is to try the Netgear firmware recovery tool, then try with a different image - perhaps 10.03 rather than the 10.03.1, as it&#039;s the earlier one that is mentioned in the hardware support list (though I would be surprised if it became un-supported in a later branch). I&#039;m also tempted by the RC release of the current version, as that&#039;s what the Beginners Guide seems to sway towards.</p><p>I&#039;m still not confident that I&#039;ve got the right image for the device. Despite recommending that I us a pre-built image, the documentation seems to give no advice on how to select the correct one for my device and all I&#039;ve got to go on is a passing forum post. Please can anyone give me a definiete pointer of what to go for?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the pointers, I now have the router up and running, and while it&#039;s going it seems to work well - I&#039;m getting 7Mb/s from a speed test, which is pretty much as fast as I&#039;ve seen my line go <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. However the router seems unstable - about 50% of the time the web interface fails to serve a page, I&#039;ve seen it lose communication with the modem, and despite finding discussions about the wireless card for the device, I&#039;m making little headway into getting it to recognize its wireless adapter. After some more searching, I&#039;ve come across this page:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg834.g/b#info.-.revision.3">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg8 … revision.3</a></p><p>Which doesn&#039;t seem to be linked to from any of the Wiki pages I&#039;ve found before. I realize that the RC1 release you have linked me to is newer than the beta they have mentioned, but the device is definitely listed as not working when the page was last updated.</p><p>Before I abandon my afternoon&#039;s work and revert to the 10.03 release that that page lists as working, do you know if the 12.09-RC1 release should be working on this device?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi SmartRat,</p><p>No, I never got the networking going on 10.03.1, I&#039;m afraid.</p><p>I tried 10.03, but that seemed even less functional. Despite the status light giving the &quot;heartbeat&quot; flash, I couldn&#039;t get anything out the network, and the serial console seemed to switch during the boot to outputting garbage, possibly it changed baud rate, but I couldn&#039;t find any settings that got any sense out of it.</p><p>12.09-RC1 came up and ran I was able to configure the modem and get it to connect. However the web-interface only responded intermittently and then the ADSL modem lights went out and appeared not to be visible when trying to diagnose over SSH.</p><p>Despite having bought the device from ebay to try out openWRT, I tried it with the stock firmware and it ran quite reliably, so I don&#039;t think that there&#039;s anything too wrong with the hardware. I never made any progress with the Wireless, I&#039;m afraid. </p><p>What version of the DG834G are you using? I believe the wireless card from the v2 is better supported than the one on the v3, but the processor is slower. Given that when the web interface was responding, pages would take 10s of seconds to come up, I wouldn&#039;t want to run it on anything slower...</p><p>Do let me know if you get anywhere with it, I like the sound of OpenWRT, but having had so much trouble when I&#039;d carefully chosen something listed as supported, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve put it back to stock and put it in the cupboard as an emergency spare modem.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>--Tobes</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again,</p><p>So after a day of work on the DG834Gv3 using 12.09-rc1, I&#039;m pretty happy with the results. Here&#039;s a summary:</p><p>-Flashing, following the link provided above by tobestool, was straightforward. No problems there.</p><p>-The LuCI web interface is painfully slow. Initially I thought it would be totally useless, and that I would want to build an image that did not include it. In the end, however, it was usable as long as you turn &quot;AutoRefresh&quot; to &quot;off&quot; at every opportunity (I haven&#039;t yet figured out how to make this the default behaviour). It&#039;s still slow and prone to errors (no wonder, given that one minute load can get above 5.00 when calling a page), but if you&#039;re very, very patient you could do all configuration with the web interface. Using SSH where possible, however, will save you a lot of time.</p><p>-The default firewall rules included a few I wanted to modify or replace. Modifying firewall rules is very strenuous for LuCI, so I strongly recommend SSH here (vi /etc/config/firewall). There are good examples on the wiki.</p><p>-Internet Access: I created a &quot;wan&quot; interface in LuCI and fed it the required details. On a reboot of the modem, I had a solid connection. There have been no problems on that front (yet), but I&#039;ll do some stress testing over the next few days. External port scans look very good. </p><p>-LEDs: The only issue (and it&#039;s trivial) with the internet connection is that there is no LED showing that the connection is active. The third LED is probably supposed to do this. I can probably figure out how to fix that over the next few days.</p><p>-Wireless: I haven&#039;t done anything with the wireless yet. According to the wiki, it is disabled by default. I want it to be disabled, so I haven&#039;t put any effort into it yet. That said, I&#039;d be happier if I could get it to work and then explicitly disable it, so I&#039;ll probably try to do that and add results here later.</p><p>-Serial Port: I didn&#039;t even consider playing with this. Tobestool is correct: it isn&#039;t necessary for any of the key steps. </p><p>Overall, I&#039;m pretty pleased with what OpenWrt can do on this device, given its hardware specs. If anyone has any questions about getting this far, please feel free to ask in this thread. I&#039;ll help if I can.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>conn-fused</strong> on 16 Mar 2013, 06:10)</p>

					<p>I have installed it on a Sphairon Turbolink JDR454WB (DG834Gv1 Clone). But it&#039;s more or less useless for me. LuCI is too buggy and crashes too often.

					<p>Did you try by recovery (minimal/emergency system) or bootloader yet? You could also try to stop unnecessary services/processes first.

However, I could not write it to partition with sysupgrade since I get the message &quot;Firmware upgrade is not implemented for this platform.&quot;.<br />My system is running with openWRT 12.09, why should I try to recovery or bootloader? In order to reinstall netgear firmware?<br />Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>erotavlas</strong> on 23 Sep 2015, 19:55)</p>

					<p>Recovery system might give you more resources and bootloader might give you direct/alternative access to the nand/mtd (if it has u-boot or something). Bootloader might be kinda complicated though if you never did that before.<br />I would try to dd the partitions directly into mtdblocks or by bootloader if possible. The actual flashing process works always but if it runs is a different question.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HectoPascal</strong> on 23 Sep 2015, 18:53)</p>

					<p>Look up the device page in the wiki. I would dump the original partitions first and roughly examine/compare them (by hexeditor) with the data you want to flash. Maybe you have to split/cut images first or something.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HectoPascal</strong> on 23 Sep 2015, 20:22)</p>

					<p>Ok. I successfully flashed my device by following the procedure here <a href="http://www.dgteam-mirror.talktalk.net/Home.html">http://www.dgteam-mirror.talktalk.net/Home.html</a> In particular, I booted the device in idle mode by pressing the reset button and powered it up. After, I flashed the firmware provided in the website of DGTEAM. It worked.<br />Finally, I would like to try openWRT 15.05 and I installed it by following the procedure of meinereiner in this therad, but it did not work since there is not enough space on the device. The device was bricked again.<br />Now I would like to flash the device with the same operations, but I cannot boot on idle mode even if I hold on the reset button for two minutes.<br />All the leds blink in strange way (power led, adsl connection led and lan leds) instead of alternating green-red blinking of power and adsl connection leds.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>erotavlas</strong> on 24 Sep 2015, 08:59)</p>
