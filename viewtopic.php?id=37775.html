					<p>Hello everybody!</p><p>Situation:<br />I have two WG302-V1! To clearify: Both are not labled with &quot;v2&quot;, that means, it is a &quot;v1&quot;.</p><p>Both are running with Backfire (10.03.1-rc4, r24045)! I also tried rc6 with the same problem.</p><p>dmesg of the first WG302 says:<br />Machine: Netgear WG302 v1 / WAG302 v1<br />....<br />Memory: 32MB = 32MB total</p><p>Because I also own a WG302-v2 as third device, I know, only the -v2 has 32MB of memory!</p><p>dmesg of the second WG302 says:<br />Machine: Intel IXDP425 Development Platform<br />....<br />Memory: 16MB = 16MB total</p><p>Both WG302-v1 are flashed with the procedure mentioned in the wiki, with the same memory addresses and so on. <br />The first device works like a charm.</p><p>The second one boots, but eth0 is not working. During bootup dmesg says:<br />IXP4xx MII Bus: probed<br />PHY 0:00 not found<br />eth%d: Could not attach to PHY<br />PHY 0:01 not found<br />eth%d: Could not attach to PHY</p><p>At this point, dmesg of the working WG302-v1 says:<br />IXP4xx MII Bus: probed<br />eth0: MII PHY 30 on NPE-B<br />i2c /dev entries driver<br />IXP4xx Watchdog Timer: heartbeat 60 sec<br />TCP westwood registered</p><p>Problem:<br />eth0 is not running on the WG302-v1 with 16MB of memory.<br />&quot;ifup lan&quot; says:<br />ifconfig: SIOCSIFADDR: No such device</p><p>When I try to fire up the net device via ifconfig with &quot;eth0&quot; or &quot;ath0&quot;, I get the same error message.</p><p>Questions?<br />How can I get eth0 running on the second WG302-v1 with the 16MB of memory?<br />Are there really to different versions of the WG302-v1? The funny thing is: The 16MB-device has a much higher serial number, than the 32MB-device.<br />Regardless from this, I like to get Backfire running on the 16MB-device, too!</p><p>Any hints?</p><p>TIA<br />Stevie</p>									</div>
