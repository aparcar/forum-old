					<p>Good day!!</p><p>I&#039;ve installed the Backfire 10.03 on my WRT54G router. I want to access via SNMP data related to the 802.11. As the SNMP package, i installed the snmpd-static_5.4.2.1-2_brcm47xx.ipk. It works correctly when i do a snmpwalk for the default MIB from the PC. The problem is: how do i add the 802.11 MIB (which i have) to the snmpd? There are tutorials on the net-snmp that talks about a mib folder, which i did not find on the router. Does anybody have already done this? Or knows how to add the MIB file?</p><p>Thanks a lot!!</p>									</div>

					<p>The MIB is just a description. It&#039;s not something you can add to the SNMP server and have it read out that information.</p><p><a href="http://www.dpstele.com/white-papers/mib-white-papers/page4.php?alink=MIB&amp;r=2&amp;cls=ylink">http://www.dpstele.com/white-papers/mib â€¦ ;cls=ylink</a></p><p>If your SNMP server does not support reading out 802.11 information, you&#039;re out of luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have run into a lot of controversial information and abandoned topics on that matter..<br />To my understanding, a MIB in the side of the SNMP Manager (let&#039;s say PC) is a translation of the OID numbers to variables with meaningful name, and it is definitely something that can be loaded. But it is not strictly necessary.<br />The MIB on the side of the SNMP Agent (let&#039;s say Router) is an implementation of how the firmware will provide the queried information or use the provided values of the set/get commands. So this is something necessary to be compiled. </p><p>More than 4 years after this topic was created, I still see the folders ferolim mentioned empty or not existing. The compilation of the bleeding edge returns output messages of including the 802.11 mib, but how to access it remains a mystery.</p>									</div>
