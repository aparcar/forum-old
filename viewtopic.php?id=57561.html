					<p>Hey community, over the weekend I setup a WR1043ND with OpenWrt 12.09 on it to completely replace my Google Fiber network box. It&#039;s fully functional but the WR1043ND can&#039;t anywhere near route at the line&#039;s full 1Gbps capability. I expected as much, but the WR1043ND is what I had available to work with. Now that I have a fully working setup though, and know it can be done, I&#039;d like to replace the WR1043ND with an OpenWrt router with better wired throughput.</p><p>So, main question: <strong>Are there any docs or records on the routing throughput capabilities of various OpenWrt compatible devices?</strong></p><p>I&#039;ve seen some links in the forum to a smallnetbuilder page -- <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/tools/charts/router/view">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/tools/charts/router/view</a> -- but I don&#039;t find that particularly helpful since those results appear to be based on OEM firmware which may be using proprietary hardware capabilties that aren&#039;t readily available to OpenWrt on the same platform. So I&#039;m looking specifically for an OpenWrt table of throughput for various devices, or even just an outright recommendation of an OpenWrt device with fast wired routing throughput. Wireless capabilities are completely&nbsp; secondary, I am only interested in wired routed throughput for the role I have in mind.</p><p>Thanks for any thoughts</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knetknight</strong> on 26 May 2015, 18:00)</p>

					<p>Do you have WR1043NDv1 (white) or WR1043NDv2 (black)? The v1 has just one eth-interface, which is split into LAN and WAN just by VLAN-tagging.

					<p>@Hank - I&#039;ve got a white v1. I would indeed expect the v2 to perform a bit better, but I&#039;m looking for some hard numbers as I&#039;d like to do better than just &quot;better&quot;, and get something that gets me as close to 1Gbps wired routing as an OpenWrt device is currently capable of.</p><p>Yes, I can and likely will eventually upgrade the WR1043ND to a 14.07, but unless that significantly improves throughput as pertains to this discussion it&#039;s not a priority for this device at this time.</p><p>Thx</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knetknight</strong> on 26 May 2015, 19:55)</p>

					<p>@tmcg - Yes, I&#039;ve read many of those threads so I understand and expect&nbsp; that I&#039;ll&nbsp; take a hit. I&#039;m personally way more interested in flexibility and control than in raw performance, so I&#039;m good with a hit -- I just want to reduce that hit to the degree possible while retaining the freedom, power, familiarity, and affordability I&#039;m accustomed to with OpenWrt.

					<p>According to your signature you already have a few devices that would be a bit better than the WR1043v1, but none of them would be able to hit the wirespeed. Your best bet is a device like a WRT1900AC (check the lengthy thread here in the forum) or a x86-based solution with more CPU power. For the latter I don&#039;t have suggestions ready.</p>									</div>

					<p>@SCF. Yessir, I do indeed have quite a pool of devices overall, but most of them are in production at remote sites so I only get to experiment with the few spare devices that I actually have on hand. Right now that amounts to a WR1043ND, a WDR3600, and WDR4300 but those represent all of my gigabit capable devices anyway, and I think the WDR3600 and WD4300 are, for purposes of wired performance, identical. So I do have a lot of devices, but when you boil the list down it comes to just three that are gigabit capable, and only two that are meaningfully differentiated.</p><p>I tested the WR1043ND against the WDR4300 earlier this morning and the results were surprising because the old WR1043ND was consistently faster on a series of simple wired routed+nat speedtests.</p><p>WR1043ND running AA - I consistently get about 200Mbps up/down. Not great but it is about what I expected.<br />WDR4300 running BB - I consistently get &quot;only&quot; about 150Mbps up/down - This was slower than I expected.</p><p>Surprising, to me, because the WDR4300 is better spec&#039;d and is running a pristine BB install with no special services running. The WR1043ND on the other hand is semi-production -- running several OpenVPN daemons, Quagga, and IGMPPROXY services -- yet still outperformed the WDR4300. I&#039;m gong to break out one of the WDR3600&#039;s and see if I can determine if the performance difference is AA vs BB, or something else. I do recall reading on the forum yesterday that in at least some cases BB was shown to be slower than AA on at least some platforms, but I thought those were early problems that had been worked out later. So, I don&#039;t know what the issue is, but despite its age and the spec difference my WR1043ND is so far proving to be the fastest wired routed OpenWrt device I have.</p><p>Mind you, I&#039;m only testing these because they are what I have on hand. If someone can vouch for an OpenWrt device that gets better wired routed+nat performance I&#039;d be glad to purchase something different (I&#039;ll look into the WRT1900AC you mentioned) I honestly thought the WDR3600/4300&#039;s would be my next step forward with OpenWrt production deployments, why I bought several as prototypes, but I&#039;m less than impressed with it now that I&#039;m actually doing some performance tests.</p><p>Appreciate the feedback, will post back my results with the 3600&#039;s and AA vs BB</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knetknight</strong> on 27 May 2015, 16:48)</p>

This was with the 1.7beta2 firmware from Ubnt. Did not flash it with openwrt since it would be the same QoS code. So that&#039;s a data point for you. </p><p>Without QoS, it&#039;s easily able to handle more than that, I was able to max out my 120 down connection... but my latency was total shit without QoS, like spiking to 300-400ms from 10-15 without load... just unacceptable. I don&#039;t know how people tolerate that shit now. I never knew what it was that was causing all my connection lag during downloads. Now that I know I can fix it easily, I just can&#039;t go back to being without QoS.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fawbaw</strong> on 29 May 2015, 17:58)</p>
