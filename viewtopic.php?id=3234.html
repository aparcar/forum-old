					<p>I bricked my wrt54g v2.2 really bad, ground to pin 16 and shortening pins 15-16(right?) didn&#039;t work anymore. So I made myself a nice little jtag cable. Put 4 100 ohm resistors on the board and a paralell cable on that. The router was able to go into failsafe, but after i tried to flash it with WRTJTAG.exe (the one that comes with a IO.dll) the memomy circuit seems to have died : /<br />The first time it seemed that everything was going ok and it worked for a long time, writing the new firmware, it finished and died.<br />The prog now complains about not finding the flash circuit, but reports that it finds the chip. Should I just buy myself a new wrt/asus or try something else (I&#039;m a broke electronics student so all suggestions are welcome)? </p><p>The cable works properly and is set up this way (Xilinx Type III compatible JTAG cable)</p><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; DB25 pin&nbsp; 2 -------&gt; 100ohm resistor -------&gt; JTAG header pin 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DB25 pin&nbsp; 3 -------&gt; 100ohm resistor -------&gt; JTAG header pin 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DB25 pin&nbsp; 4 -------&gt; 100ohm resistor -------&gt; JTAG header pin 7<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DB25 pin 13 -------&gt; 100ohm resistor -------&gt; JTAG header pin 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DB25 pin 20 --------------------------------&gt; JTAG header pin 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DB25 pin 25 --------------------------------&gt; JTAG header pin 2</p><p>log thing:</p><p>Probing bus... <br />CHIP ID: 00010100011100010010000101111111&nbsp; (1471217F)<br />*** Found a Broadcom BCM4712 Rev 1 chip ***<br />Issuing Processor / Peripheral Reset...<br />Done<br />Issuing JTAGBRK / Hammering Watchdog Off (80 iterations)...<br />xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />Done<br />Probing Flash...<br />*** UNKNOWN or NO FLASH CHIP DETECTED ***<br />Attempting Automatic Reset via Watchdog...<br />Done</p><br /><br /><p>Also the weather outside is horrible!
