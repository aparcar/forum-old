					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I compiled the OpenWrt package myself because i needed some libraries.<br />Nevertheless I can&#039;t compile my program altough it has worked on an older Package SDK.</p><p>Everytime i want to compile I get following message:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ERROR: Please fix package/helloworld/Makefile</code></pre></div><p>Here is my makefile:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>##############################################
# OpenWrt Makefile for helloworld program
#
#
# Most of the variables used here are defined in
# the include directives below. We just need to
# specify a basic description of the package,
# where to build our program, where to find
# the source files, and where to install the
# compiled program on the router.
#
# Be very careful of spacing in this file.
# Indents should be tabs, not spaces, and
# there should be no trailing whitespace in
# lines that are not commented.
#
##############################################

include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

# Name and release number of this package
PKG_NAME:=helloworld
PKG_RELEASE:=1

# This specifies the directory where we&#039;re going to build the program.
# The root build directory, $(BUILD_DIR), is by default the build_mipsel
# directory in your OpenWrt SDK directory
PKG_BUILD_DIR := $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PKG_NAME)

include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/package.mk

# Specify package information for this program.
# The variables defined here should be self explanatory.
define Package/helloworld
    SECTION:=utils
    CATEGORY:=Utilities
    TITLE:=Helloworld -- prints a snarky message
    DEPENDS:=libpthread
endef

define Package/helloworld/description
    Control program four my WLAN tuner
endef

# Specify what needs to be done to prepare for building the package.
# In our case, we need to copy the source files to the build directory.
# This is NOT the default.  The default uses the PKG_SOURCE_URL and the
# PKG_SOURCE which is not defined here to download the source from the web.
# In order to just build a simple program that we have just written, it is
# much easier to do it this way.
define Build/Prepare
    mkdir -p $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)
    $(CP) ./src/* $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/
endef

# We do not need to define Build/Configure or Build/Compile directives
# The defaults are appropriate for compiling a simple program such as this one

# Specify where and how to install the program. Since we only have one file,
# the helloworld executable, install it by copying it to the /bin directory on
# the router. The $(1) variable represents the root directory on the router running
# OpenWrt. The $(INSTALL_DIR) variable contains a command to prepare the install
# directory if it does not already exist.  Likewise $(INSTALL_BIN) contains the
# command to copy the binary file from its current location (in our case the build
# directory) to the install directory.
define Package/helloworld/install
    $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/bin
    $(INSTALL_BIN) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/helloworld $(1)/bin/
endef

# This line executes the necessary commands to compile our program.
# The above define directives specify all the information needed, but this
# line calls BuildPackage which in turn actually uses this information to
# build a package.
$(eval $(call BuildPackage,helloworld))</code></pre></div><p>I hope someone can help me.</p><p>Best regards Robert</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Avr</strong> on 13 Jan 2010, 17:32)</p>

					<p>Dogge: stupid suggestion, the build system will fail as well if the makefile is invalid</p><p>Avr:</p><p>Most likely a tab vs. space issue.<br />Stuff in the &quot;Package/helloworld&quot; and &quot;Package/helloworld/description&quot; sections must be indented by two or more *spaces*.<br />Lines in the &quot;Build/Prepare&quot; and &quot;Package/helloworld/install&quot; must be indented by one *tab* since the commands must be passed to the shell.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>
