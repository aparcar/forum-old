					<p>First to put it into context:<br />I&#039;m in the process of building a hotspot sytem and have moved across from DD-WRT to OpenWRT/X-WRT, at this point I have X-WRT brcm 2.4 installed but have been configuring via SSH, I have intermediate Linux experience.</p><p>The MySQL database is hosted on a remote standard issue web server, I have successfully built an almost identical configuration (including the same remote database) on my Xubuntu x64 (Gutsy) Desktop machine, using radtest I get the correct responses to valid and invalid users.</p><p>But using radtest against OpenWRT I get &quot;rad_recv: Access-Reject&quot; it seems to be having issues talking to the database.</p><p>radiusd -fX output:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rad_recv: Access-Request packet from host 192.168.1.13:33790, id=57, length=60

					<p>For some reason the above repository has since become unavailable, but I managed to find the same files here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages-mipsel/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a></p><p>Unfortunatly it&#039;s not a repository, so you need to feed the entire URL into ipkg as well as the URL of all dependancy packages, eg: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ipkg install http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages-mipsel/packages/freeradius-mod-sql-mysql_1.1.6-1_mipsel.ipk http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/packages-mipsel/packages/freeradius-mod-sql_1.1.6-1_mipsel.ipk and so on.</code></pre></div><p>Other than that all seems to be going well so far.</p><p>Jordan.</p>									</div>
