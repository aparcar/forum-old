					<p>This device is equivalent to a TM02 plus a 3000 mAh battery, a MicroSDHC slot, a power button, and a battery status LED, minus the mode selector switch.</p><p>The hardware is otherwise the same of TM02, but TM02 OpenWRT image cannot work on it unchanged because the presence of the microSDHC slot alters the numbering of the USB device mountpoints, which are referenced in the initial lines of the TM02 firmware file.

					<p>Hi RangerZ, </p><p>I am trying to flash that image (openwrt-15.05-rc3-ramips-rt305x-ht-tm02-initramfs-uImage.bin) but I am getting an error &quot;wrong file format&quot;.

					<p>You can not flash the HooToo to OpenWrt direct.&nbsp; You need to use the bin from step 1 (but you proably want to read the original TM-02 post page 1 first).&nbsp; the link I gave was to get the sysupgrade to 15.05 RC3 AFTER the initial flash.</p>									</div>
