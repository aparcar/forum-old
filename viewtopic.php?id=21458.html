					<p>Hi,<br />So I&#039;ve been studying the wiki page as well as searching forum posts for the past several hours and have had difficulty figuring out how to forward my wireless signal through a second router.&nbsp; I&#039;m using build r17264 from the ar17xx snapshot.</p><p>Here&#039;s the scenario:<br />Router A: Acting as a client and receiving wireless signal and forwards this signal through all of its ethernet ports *ALREADY SET UP*<br />Router B: I would like this router to receive the signal from router A via ethernet and then forward the signal through wifi *NOT WORKING*</p><p>So far, I haven&#039;t been able to receive anything from router A or setup any type of wireless network.&nbsp; Also, I receive an error upon trying to access LuCI via the web so this is not an option for preforming the configuration... it all needs to be done via command line.&nbsp; If anyone has any advice it&#039;d be much appreciated!</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Why not just use WDS?&nbsp; I find it much simpler to use WDS bridge mode and have one big happy LAN for a home network.&nbsp; All this &quot;AP client&quot; business is a PITA and for what?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, so it seems that with WDS I&#039;ll lose half the bandwith for my wireless access point.&nbsp; I can&#039;t do this because I&#039;m receiving my internet source via one of my routers and the AP is far enough away that half won&#039;t cut it.&nbsp; Also, the routers are side by side so not being able to access wireless on one is not a concern!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure what you mean about &quot;lose half the bandwidth&quot;.&nbsp; If you are hooking up your clients via WIRE to the LAN ports on router#2, there is no loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;The effect of losing half (actually more) bandwidth is when a single-radio repeater is serving also local WiFi clients.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since you are simply using it as a point-to-point link you avoid this effect.</p><p>I used 2 WRT for long-distance backhaul all the time I just use a different SSID and key so those 2 WRT only talk with each other via WiFi not with clients.&nbsp; The LAN ports on these backhaul units would then couple to other radios which provided client access.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thus forming a 2-radio repeater, see?</p>									</div>
