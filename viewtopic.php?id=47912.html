					<p>I setup ubiquiti routerstation pro which is working great and I also installed a package using &quot;opkg install squid&quot; after installation I am confused to redirect all http and https traffic to that squid proxy which is installed inside this routerstation pro router. I also confused which active control list I should need to put for this proxy because its inside the rs pro router. I will really appreciate if someone can guide me step by step because I am new to install this squid for this router, I requested my friends who know a lot about this stuff but they did not helped me at all. I will really appreciate response regarding my issue with redirecting traffic towards squid proxy.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
