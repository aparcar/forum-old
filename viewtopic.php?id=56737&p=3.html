					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m a total noob when it comes to openwrt, but I bought this router, because of the great price/performance. And I wanted to replace my current isp router, well because it&#039;s just a piece of sh*t.&nbsp; </p><p>So the thing is I got this router while under the impression that I could install dd-wrt/open wrt. My isp does support own equipment from customers, but the router needs to be able to have seperate vlans; for iptv and internet. With some other services like igmp and dhcp from wan to the vlans.</p><p>So the standard firmware doesn&#039;t support that, but appearently openwrt/ddwrt does. So I was happy to find that this 5th version has been added to openwrt. </p><p>But I&#039;m still waiting, and I would like it asap. Now I don&#039;t want to rush anybody. As you&#039;re doing this for free I presume. And I&#039;m a total noob at this kind of programming. So I just wanted to say thank you for all the effort so far! And I&#039;m hoping you could keep us updated more frequently. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Because now my router is just an overpriced wifi switch/ap <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

I would also like to know how I can install this image to the new device. Can I follow the standard documentation or this device requires a specific installation procedure?
