					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWrt and am trying to assign different DNS via DHCP based on the MAC address of clients.&nbsp; I think the link below is what I need, however it doesn&#039;t seem to be working as I expect.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp#classifying.clients.and.assigning.individual.options">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp#cl â€¦ al.options</a></p><p>This did nothing at all:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config mac
        option mac &#039;00:11:22:33:44:55&#039;
        list dhcp_option &#039;6,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4&#039;</code></pre></div><p>And this worked in that the DNS was given out and was different to what was configured in the router, however its given out to all clients and not just for the specific MAC address</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config mac
        option mac &#039;00:11:22:33:44:55&#039;
        option networkid &#039;lan&#039;
        list dhcp_option &#039;6,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Any thoughts or alternate solutions would be appreciated?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
