					<p>Same thing happens to me, but not after one year. It went like this from the first time. Here is my e-mail to Tenda support:<br />&quot;Hello,</p><p> I have purchased a Tenda 3G150B wireless 3G router. I am using it together with a Huawei E3131 3G dongle.</p><p>Problem description:<br />Right after the router is booting and connecting to the modem, everything works fine (Internet connection works).<br />If I use it&#039;s web interface to manually disconnect it (or automatically, by using &quot;reconnect on demand&quot; function) and than reconnect it back, it says that it is connected but the internet connection doesn&#039;t work anymore. I also noticed (in 3G statistics) that there is some data transmitted but no data is received.<br />This never happens after a fresh reboot, but only during router up-time.</p><p>Can you please help me out with this issue?&quot;</p><p>I am waiting for their answers. I will keep you updated.</p><p>In the meantime, does anyone have any clue about this issue??</p>									</div>

					<p>I have also emailed tenda support with the same issue.</p><p>At first when using the Huawei E220 puck with the 3g150b I got no error message and had to reboot the router for the connection to work. When I tried with a Huawei E169 stick i get a &quot;sim card not detected&quot; error after about 18-24 hours.</p><p>I tried a different usb power source (thinking it was a lack of juice) but still the same problem (two Type A to Mini B with both USB ports capable of 2.1A on the new adapter). I tried a different simcard (Telia and 3) but still the same problem.</p><p>When checking the logs I see several LCP down messages and it doesn&#039;t seem to be able to detect the modem. I will post screenshots later as I need to go and reset the bloody thing again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Another thing I have noticed is that pin codes need to be deactivated before using the simcard with the router/modem. Entering the correct pin into the admin interface will not work.</p><p>edit: according to this user on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManO9Zk4uGo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ManO9Zk4uGo</a> he has the same issue but not very often.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fenix</strong> on 27 Nov 2014, 12:52)</p>
