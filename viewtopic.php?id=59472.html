Maybe something changed on my MAC?

					<p>But &quot;sudo root 192.168.100.1&quot; means: become root <span class="bbu">in this machine</span>, and execute command &quot;root&quot; with parameter &quot;192.168.100.1&quot;. Thus that password you are being required is the root password on your own machine; and even if you type it, next error will probably be &quot;root: command not found&quot;.</p><p>I guess you meant to execute &quot;ssh root@192.168.100.1&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>^^^^^ what he said.</p><p>Also, if you&#039;ve reset your router already, you may need to remove router&#039;s old RSA key (which gets regenerated randomly on first boot after flash) from ~/.ssh/known_hosts otherwise you won&#039;t be able to connect.</p>									</div>
