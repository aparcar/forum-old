					<p>Orca, watch out! Another bump. Make sure you do not trip and fall. <br />Do you really think bumping openwrt.org admins to death will accomplish anything? Instead of beating your head against the wall give site admins some suggestions. Your robots.txt suggestion is obviously wrong.</p><p>Here are my suggestions:<br />1. Add a description meta tag to all pages. Currently none of WIKI pages have a &quot;meta name=&#039;description&#039;&quot; tag. Having a good human readable description tag is important.<br />2. Fix the &quot;meta name=&#039;keywords&#039;&quot; tag. For example the Asterisk page discussed above has the following keywords tag &quot;doc,howto,voip.asterisk&quot;. No wonder Google does not find it. There is not even a mention of OpenWRT or a separate word Asterisk in there.<br />3. Having a sitemap.xml can also be critical. With so many pages, I actually think that the absence of a sitemap is a -1 for an overall OpenWRT pagerank. I have noticed that openwrt.org does not have a publicly available sitemap referenced from robots.txt. It could very well be that this is a sitemap.xml issue.<br />4. Finally make sure that you can browse the wiki in ELinks. If you cannot do it in ELinks, your chances of being indexed are 0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>F1aw</strong> on 21 Oct 2011, 01:31)</p>

When stuff becomes easily portable, nobody fucks with nobody. Everyone is free to contribute, to come and go freely and be happy.

I didn&#039;t count the hits.&lt;/irony&gt; How is the number of hits to old and obsolete wiki-pages an argument?<br />I search for content, not for hits, to solve my problems. I write content so that others can solve theirs. That&#039;s it. When content is not found, the whole wiki becomes useless.</p><p>Can you point out your recent edit, which was already indexed by google?

I think one way to address this, is by creating better content, and providing some deep links to this content, not by wasting each others time. For this, I need contributors... given the fact that people asking for support in this forum often do not read the wiki, google is the best way, to show the way. You see the point?</p>									</div>
