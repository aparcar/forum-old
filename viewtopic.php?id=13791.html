					<p>Here&#039;s the situation:</p><p>I&#039;ve got an OpenVPN server in a remote location, to which I&#039;m trying to attach my network through my recently-installed OpenWRT router. </p><p>The VPN server is running routed connections over the tun interface, and it only hands out a single IP per client. </p><p>Routing all of my LAN&#039;s internet traffic through the VPN is neither possible nor desirable in this case. I only want traffic destined for the VPN&#039;s IP range (10.42.0.0/24) to be sent by way of the VPN, with all other traffic going out through the normal WAN interface.</p><p>I&#039;m able to install the config on a box behind the router, and it works fine. I can install it on the router itself, and it also works fine...from the router. But from other hosts on the LAN, nothing goes through.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone can help me with this. I&#039;m sure the OpenVPN config is fine (since I can reach the other end of the VPN just fine from the router itself), and the problem is in my iptables rules (which are, at this point, bog-standard -- I&#039;ve tried adapting various rules posted in response to other people&#039;s queries, but none of them work, and so I&#039;ve returned to the default ones).</p><p>Please note that, although I don&#039;t care one way or the other about blocking connections to my LAN from the other end of the VPN, I very much doubt that there will ever be any.</p>									</div>
