					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I&#039;m attempting to configure a two-zone router and need some config help.</p><p>Zone1 is the LAN.&nbsp; This is basically the router running in infrastructure mode.&nbsp; The router&#039;s Internet port plugs in to a local LAN.&nbsp; Firewall, DNS and DHCP are hosted by servers on the LAN.&nbsp; The router&#039;s switch ports and first SSID are part of this zone.</p><p>Zone2 hosts a guest SSID.&nbsp; In this case, the router hosts the DNS and DHCP, but routes through Zone1 to the LAN&#039;s firewall/Internet router.&nbsp; Zone2 should be denied access to anything in Zone1 other than the firewall.</p><p>I&#039;ve read the Configure-a-guest-WLAN article, and it helped.&nbsp; But my situation is a little different as I have to route through Zone1 to get to the Internet.</p><p>Has anyone done this?&nbsp; Can you give me some pointers?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Lane Beneke</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, written_direcon.</p><p>Unfortunately, been there done that.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t work for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because my router is not connected directly to the Internet, but accesses it through a local network.</p><p>Still experimenting, though.&nbsp; Restored my OpenWRT to factory settings three times now.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still striking out with this setup.&nbsp; Not sure if I can get by with two zones, or if I need a third.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what the physical setup looks like...</p><br /><p>&nbsp; OpenWrt---------LAN----------Firewall-----------Internet</p><p>OpenWrt-&gt;guest = 192.168.1.1<br />OpenWrt-&gt;lan = 192.168.85.12<br />LAN = 192.168.85.0<br />Firewall = 192.168.85.254</p><p>I would draw clouds around LAN and Internet if I could.</p><p>So, I want 192.168.1.0 (guest) to be able to route through 192.168.85.0 (lan).&nbsp; However, while the router needs access to 192.168.85.254 (default route), access to the remainder of 192.168.85.0 (lan) should be blocked.</p><p>So far, it&#039;s been an all or nothing proposition.&nbsp; Either I turn on forwarding and (guest) sees everything, or I turn it off and (guest) cannot access anything.&nbsp; Firewall rules don&#039;t seem to matter.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking that the router sees the entire Internet as belonging to (lan).&nbsp; So, do I need a third zone?&nbsp; (wan)?&nbsp; Would that allow me to forward to (wan) without granting access to (lan)?&nbsp; If so, how would I enable access to the default route, which belongs to (lan)?</p><p>I&#039;ll continue to experiment as I have opportunity.&nbsp; However, if you can help then please jump right in.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Lane</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NoDough</strong> on 24 Jul 2012, 00:47)</p>
