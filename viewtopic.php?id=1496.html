					<p>unless i&#039;m totally missing something (not out of the question), i believe that in the experimental build, i.e., as of 3.37.2 firmware, wpa supplicant is built into the wl.o driver.&nbsp; in other words, you don&#039;t need to nas to run a wpa client.</p><p>what you do need, as far as i can tell, is the following settings</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wl0_mode=wet
wl0_auth_mode=psk
wl0_wpa_psk=&lt;your_preshared_key&gt;</code></pre></div><p>NB: wl0_mode=sta will NOT work. You do not need to have wl0_crypto or wl0_wpa_gtk_rekey set (but wlconf actually resets them to defaults) and, as far as I can tell, it doesn&#039;t matter to what you set wl0_wep.</p><p>this seems to work on my setup, and seems to also be backed up by my reading of wlconf.c (starting at line 641).&nbsp; anyone else care to test and confirm?</p>									</div>
