					<p>Hey all,</p><p>Newbie here, hoping this is the right place to post. I&#039;m new to OpenWRT, and I just picked up a TP-Link MR3020.&nbsp; I travel a lot for work, and I&#039;d like to make this router into a travel router.</p><p>Basically, I&#039;d like to plug this router into my hotel&#039;s ethernet connection, and have the MR3020 broadcast a WiFi network that my phone, laptop, etc.. can connect to. However, I&#039;d like anything that connects to this wireless network to be VPNed in back to my home network (running DD-WRT PPTP server). Is this configuration possible?</p><p>I don&#039;t need step-by-step instructions, but just a general guide as to what needs to be done. So far, I&#039;ve figured that I&#039;d have to change the default IP to something unique that a hotel won&#039;t use (10.80.1.1) and create two separate interfaces for LAN and WLAN. However, I&#039;m not sure where the PPTP part comes into play. Do I create a PPTP interface and bridge it with the WLAN interface?</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey all,</p><p>Guess I didn&#039;t subscribe to this thread, so I&#039;m just seeing all these posts now. I&#039;m running a DD-WRT router at home with a PPTP server on it. I only used PPTP because it was dead-simple to setup, but I do plan on upgrading to OpenVPN shortly. </p><p>As metai wrote, I&#039;ve come across more and more hotels that don&#039;t even have jacks in the walls, and only offer WiFi. I&#039;d assume you would need to setup a DHCP client on the wireless interface, but even then, you still have to get past the captive portal. Anyways, I recently used Airbnb to stay in someone&#039;s apartment, and had wired access to their router. However, it appears they had blocked PPTP ports, and I didn&#039;t have admin access to the router. All the more reason to switch to OpenVPN.</p><p>In the end, I figured out how to do it correctly, with PPTP.&nbsp; Could any of you glance over my post and let me know if anything is wrong/missing? <a href="http://wp.me/p4oOKl-dk">http://wp.me/p4oOKl-dk</a></p><p>I appreciate all the help and advice!</p>									</div>
