					<p>Does anyone know if OpenWrt WhiteRussian is susceptible to DNS spoofing as outlined in&nbsp; recent vulnerability disclosures (see <a href="http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=4687">http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=4687</a> for details)?&nbsp; If so, is there a specific patch or version of DNSMASQ or other packages to fix the problem?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Looking at <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/packages/">The package list of WhiteRussian</a> it seems, that it uses dnsmasq 2.35.</p><p>dnsmasq 2.43 (just released: <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/CHANGELOG">ChangeLog</a>) includes changes to address <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447">CVE-2008-1447</a>.</p><p>So, I think, yes, WhiteRussian is affected.</p>									</div>

					<p>Fun. I didn&#039;t read the changelog that carefully.</p><p>I finally found the official <a href="http://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2008q3/002183.html">Announcement</a> from dnsmasq.
