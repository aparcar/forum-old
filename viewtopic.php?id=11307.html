					<p>I am trying to port Kamikaze to the Buffalo WHR-G125.&nbsp; This device has a unusual wifi chipset, BCM5354KFBG.&nbsp; My understanding is that the kernel needs to be patched with the driver for that chipset.&nbsp; dd-wrt has already built a tree that contains the driver.&nbsp; I was informed that they got the driver via a NDA.&nbsp; The dd-wrt tree that contains the needed drivers can be located here: <a href="http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/dd-wrt/browser/src/linux/brcm/linux.v24_bcm5354">http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/dd-wrt/brows â€¦ 24_bcm5354</a></p><p>My question now is, how do we take that information and port it into a open-wrt kernel?</p><p>I am new to the porting scene, but willing to try and do it.</p><p>Any assistance anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
