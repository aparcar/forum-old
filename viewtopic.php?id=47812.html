					<p>Hi,<br />I wen by this forum post:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23308">usb mod</a></p><p>with my wrt54gl and also traced connection with my multimeter and everything seems ok (clearly seems).<br />Next I installed needed packages and connected my pl2303 usb-serial (with installed opkg usb-serial package) to the usb port. My pl2303 works with my wr703n router fine with no problem.</p><p>The system does not work. In case of my wr703n, after connecting the pl2303 and issuing dmesg, I can see that it is recognized in the published log. In wrt54gl, I can&#039;t see it but only that the driver for pl2303 is installed (core). Well, yet worst: when I do &quot;ls /dev/&quot; I don&#039;t see anything as of /dev/ttyUSB0, so it seems that port is not available yet.</p><p>Could anyone kindly tell me how to further trace the problem please? Maybe I must short D+ and D- to have a loopback test? Well but that must be after I have at least a USB port found in /dev right?</p>									</div>
