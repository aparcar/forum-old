					<p>I&#039;ve decided to replace my device&#039;s stock firmware with OpenWRT. So looking through the relevant page, I see that I must load the initial image and here I am stuck.</p><p>My unit at the back shows v4.25 and I would like a web interface but the relevant page does not list a web interface for my version. It does for 4.21 and 4.22 though. Does that mean my version cannot have a web gui? Or that the package does not have it and I can load it later?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd</a> looks to be a mess.</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … x/generic/</a></p><p>I see:</p><p>openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr741nd-v4-squashfs-factory.bin - used to upgrade from stock (stock = default tp-link firmware)<br />openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr741nd-v4-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin - used to upgrade ONLY if you already have OpenWRT installed</p><p>both of them have Luci.</p><p>Wiki say nothing if there is a difference or not between tl-wr741n and tl-wr741nd, usualy the only diference between n and nd is that nd has detachable antennas, but I have no clue what TP-Link is actually doing. <strong>So if you use any of those images you do it on your own risk, if you break your router I can only say that you have been warned.</strong></p><p>-------</p><p>Before flashing OpenWRT you should understand that things can go wrong, like:<br />1) you flashed the wrong image and you bricked your router<br />2) if the pc and router are not connected to an ups and the electrical power is cut (totaly out of your control) you will probably brick the router</p><p>Also you should kinda know why you want OpenWRT. Some reasons can be:<br />1) security reasons mostly cause tp-link hasn&#039;t released a firmware upgrade for years for your router<br />2) your isp offers ipv6 but the stock firmware doesn&#039;t offer support for ipv6</p><p>The nice part regarding OpenWRT is that you can add/remove things based on your needs. In the 4MB flash routers case if you want luci + other things (that are not in the images you can download) the bad part is that you will kinda have to compile OpenWRT yourself to remove/add new things (when you remove stuff from it you don&#039;t actually free the space cause what you removed it&#039;s not deleted so even in remove case if you want/need the free space you have to compile it from sources).</p><p>If you download OpenWRT from the above link, and flash it, compared to stock firmware you will miss: wps, upnp and qos.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>vico wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I do not want to run an old, unmaintained release... So my options are run Barrier Breaker or no gui? Hmm...</p></blockquote></div><p>Main question is what you understand by a maintained release.<br />If you use the image you can download from the above link you are stuck with an release that is missing some fixes (I&#039;m talking about 15.05.1 here). Your router has 4MB flash and I doubt you can install any package on it (you&#039;ll have ~400kB left after flashing 15.05.1 and saving the router configurations).</p><p>If you want a relative newer version either you compile 15.05.1 from git and add luci (luci is not enabled by default) (you get a minor kernel version bump, several fixes compared to what you can download from the link above; not sure what they added in 741 case but in the case of the routers I use I have to enable the force use of reg domain (no clue why it&#039;s not enabled by default..., so i can use channels 12,13), remove the usb support (because without a mod there is no usb port, no clue why the usb part end up enabled by default in 15.05.1) and add iputils-traceroute6 (not really needed but well it doesn&#039;t hurt to be able to do ipv6 traceroute from the router) or you compile trunk or LEDE add Luci so you have a web interface (keep in mind that trunk and LEDE are not considered stable).</p><p>CVE-2016-5696 for example is not fixed even if you compile 15.05.1 from git, I know it&#039;s fixed in LEDE, no clue about OpenWRT trunk. They backported the fixes for CVE-2016-5696 in 3.18.41 (<a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/ChangeLog-3.18.41">https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel … og-3.18.41</a> at the bottom) and if someone will bump the OpenWRT kernel from 3.18.36 to 3.18.41 it will be fixed (alternative is to make the patch yourself or see if the patch for kernel 3.18 from LEDE works (mostly check if the removed lines in the patch exist in the file that is beeing changed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />, you might or might not see some not so nice messages (some complains saying that someone hasn&#039;t done something <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />) while compiling if you just copy the patch from LEDE but the patch is applied <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> )).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thedukesd</strong> on 8 Sep 2016, 20:00)</p>

					<p>@thedukesd thanks.</p><p>I am quite clear on the dangers of doing this and that is why I am researching at this stage. </p><p>As for why I am doing it, I want to isolate a bunch of wireless clients (tenants who are getting free wifi from us) on to their own wifi network for security reasons and possibly rate limit them. Of course the other reason is that this is an old model and it is doubtful that TP-Link will release any more updates for this model.</p><p>What do I understand by a maintained release? Exactly what it says. That as security and serious bugs are found in the kernel and other components, a updated firmware package would be released. </p><p>As for building it myself, I don&#039;t know if I can or want to spend the time on that...</p>									</div>
