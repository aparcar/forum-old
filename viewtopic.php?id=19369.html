					<p>I&#039;m using OpenWrt Kamikaze (r14417) with Luci web administration interface</p><p>(sorrry for my bad english, i&#039;m italian)</p><p>actually i&#039;ve<br />- a standard ADSL always on<br />- a router &#039;closed&#039; by ISP, running at 192.168.0.1 (yes a &#039;0.x&#039; net...)<br />- an access point with OpenWrt Kamize running at 192.168.0.10 (method: access point)<br />- a pc with static&nbsp; ip: 192.168.0.20, connected via wifi to the access point. The gateway is 192.168.0.10</p><p>Question 0: Is it okay?</p><p>Now i&#039;m running aMule (eMule for linux). I need tcp port 4800 and udp port 5800 opened</p><p>My ISP really opened 4800 TCP and 5800 UDP from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.10, so packets are forwarded correctly.<br />Now I go on Luci on Network -&gt; Firewall -&gt; Traffic Rediretion and set up <br />- forward for 4800 tcp to 192.168.0.20 <br />- forward for 5800 udp to 1192.168.0.20 </p><p>Question 1: what &quot;external zone&quot; must i set? Lan or Wan?<br />Question 2: the forward doesn&#039;t look like working, eMule don&#039;t receive no comunications on tcp 4800. Why ?</p><p>Question 3: Is it correct for me using on pc the A.P. address for gateway or must I use the router address for gateway? WHY can I browse the web either with 0.10 and 0.1 for gateway !? WHY ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>realtebo</strong> on 14 Mar 2009, 22:58)</p>
