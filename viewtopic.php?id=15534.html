					<p>First of all:</p><p>Hello everyone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><br /><p>Found that forum because a friend told me of OpenWRT. What i can see so far it looks great <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>So my prob:</p><p>IÂ´m going online with an UMTS (Mobile Broadband) Modem. At the moment its connected to a desktop pc so everytime i want to go online this pc has to be on. Because i donÂ´t want to have it run all the time i want to connect my UMTS Modem to an &quot;old&quot; T-Sinus 154 DSL because it has an USB Port.</p><p>Found some pages about OpenWRT on this router but i didnÂ´t got it really... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>So could someone tell me what do i need?</p><p>Read something about WLAN wouldnÂ´t work... that would be no prob as long as the Ethernet interfaces work. My need is at least 1 working ethernet port, working usb port and possibility to create a connection over the connected UMTS Modem and share it to the network.</p><p>Thanks very much in advance for any help!!! This loud desktop is really going on my nerves <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Sinus 154 DSL is unsupported.</p><p>Only those Sinus family members which are based on AR7 work partially with OpenWrt. Partially means that many things do not work, and USB support is one of the missing features.</p>									</div>
