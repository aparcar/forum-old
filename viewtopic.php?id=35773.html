					<p>Dear Forum!</p><p>Yesterday the craziest thing happened to me while I was connected with my laptop through wireless connection to my router, which is a Bytton Topex GPRS aka&nbsp; Asus WL-500G Deluxe. I was doing a speedtest on Speedtest.net just out of curiosity and when the upload was about to finish, the wireless connection broke and the router disappeared from the radar. Neither my laptop nor any other laptop saw it (I tried two others). So I rebooted the router, the connection came back on, but when I did the Speedtest again, the same thing happened. I was shocked because after 2 years of perfect functioning the router started to act crazy for no reason.</p><p>Last evening I reproduced the situation many times, tried to connect and Speedtest from different laptops, tried with OpenWRT Backfire 10.03 and 10.03.1, but in all cases I ended up with a dead wireless connection. Obviously the Speedtest could never finish successfully. The LED for AIR stays turned on, but it&#039;s not blinking is at normally does. I am able to connect to the router through cable, Internet works fine, I can do as many Speedtests I want. It&#039;s the wireless connection that&#039;s dying only.</p><p>So I was wondering if you could help me figure out what on earth could suddenly go so wrong!? Because I for one didn&#039;t see anything bad in the logs. Please see below. Thank you.</p><p>Before Speedtest (wireless OK):<br />- <a href="http://pastebin.com/eXwaB0Z6">dmesg</a><br />- <a href="http://pastebin.com/bJCEZMz9">part of system log</a></p><p>After Speedtest (wireless dead):<br />- <a href="http://pastebin.com/5CHAXAri">dmesg</a><br />- <a href="http://pastebin.com/3reaz3JW">part of system log</a></p><p>And of course <em>ifconfig -a</em>: <a href="http://pastebin.com/6Gduv8Tu">http://pastebin.com/6Gduv8Tu</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>birrbert</strong> on 27 Mar 2012, 08:09)</p>

					<p>In your opinion could any of these serial to USB cables help me discover the problem? I would connect the USB side to my laptop, the other side to the UART pinout on the router and check things out with a hyperterminal software like the latest version of Putty or SecureCRT. I&#039;m asking because I just did some research so in theory I know that to do, but I have no practice yet.</p><p>- <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/PL2303HX-USB-TTL-Serial-pport-Converter-Module-5V-3-3V-Output-Free-Shiping-/160765044944?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item256e57e8d0#ht_4452wt_1270">PL2303HX USB to TTL Serial pport Converter Module 5V &amp; 3.3V Output</a><br />- <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/2pcs-USB-2-0-TTL-UART-6PIN-CP2102-Module-Serial-Converter-Dual-3-3V-5V-Power-/280837382524?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item416336617c#ht_4314wt_1270">2pcs USB 2.0 to TTL UART 6PIN CP2102 Module Serial Converter Dual 3.3V &amp;5V Power</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>birrbert</strong> on 28 Mar 2012, 15:23)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your reply <strong>drekthar</strong>. Could you please post here the link to that active ticket? I&#039;d love to read it. Thanks.</p><p>edit:<br />By the way, the Asus WL-500G Deluxe has an integrated wireless card, so I cannot try another one. It&#039;s the Premium version which has a mini PCI slot. So I figured I&#039;ll try the latest trunk firmware as you recommended, but I can&#039;t seem to find the right file. Normally I would use the file <em>openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx</em> from the <em>/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/</em> directory, but there&#039;s no equivalent for that in the <em>/snapshots/trunk/</em> download folder. Why?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>birrbert</strong> on 28 Mar 2012, 17:03)</p>

					<p>So I guess there&#039;s no trunk release for the Asus WL-500G Deluxe because all trunks have kernel 2.6 and with this kernel the Broadcom wireless wouldn&#039;t work. Correcto?</p>									</div>
