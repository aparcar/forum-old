					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to get <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs">Tahoe-LAFS</a> running on my OpenWRT-Router.<br />This shouldn&#039;t be a problem, as it is written in Python.<br />However, Tahoe-LAFS relies on dependencies that use C code like <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> or <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/pycryptopp">pycryptopp</a>.<br />The Tahoe-LAFS install script downloads and tries to compile these depencies, which (of course) gives the error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>unable to execute mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc: No such file or directory</code></pre></div><p>At first I wanted to install gcc, but I think this is even more difficult than getting the dependencies cross-compiled.</p><p>I found a Twisted package for Kamikaze, which worked without problems.<br />Right now, I am stuck with pycryptopp. It is written in python, but relies on C code,<br />and as I am new to Python I don&#039;t know how to write a Makefile to cross-compile pycryptopp.</p><br /><p>Has anybody tried or succeeded in running Tahoe-LAFS on an OpenWRT router?<br />Can you give me hints for cross-compiling pycryptopp?</p><p>All I could find was <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2009-November/003156.html">this post</a> which does not give hints for OpenWRT.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p><br /><p>Regards<br />Klaus</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi </p><p>I am busy using tahoe-lafs in an implementation for my honours project. I would really like (need) to get this package installed on OpenWRT. I am running a RB433AH but I am really stuck on the part where cross compiling is necessary.</p><p>Please can I get some assistance as I feel I am running blind and not really sure what to do.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
