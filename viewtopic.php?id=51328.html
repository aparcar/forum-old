					<p>Has anyone performed any throughput tests using openvpn-openssl and openvpn-polarssl? Is polarssl faster than openssl on MIPS?<br />Using my current setup (pppoe, tap, udp, blowfish, no compression) I&#039;m getting ~6.5 Mbit/s in iperf, between an Asus WL-500gP v2 and a DIR-825 B2 (the Asus is obviously the bottleneck).<br />I was wondering if anyone tried the polarssl version and found it to be faster on MIPS hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to test a few scenarios; I&#039;ll post the results here, maybe someone will find them useful:<br />WL-500gP v2, Backfire 10.03.1 brcm-2.4, openvpn-openssl: 6.50 Mbit/s<br />WL-500gP v2, trunk r41353 brcm47xx, openvpn-openssl: 4.65 Mbit/s<br />WL-500gP v2, trunk r41353 brcm47xx, openvpn-polarssl: 4.50 Mbit/s<br />Looks like the throughput is pretty much the same between the openssl and polarssl versions and there&#039;s no point in running newer versions of OpenWrt on this platform, since it&#039;s much slower and unstable.</p>									</div>
