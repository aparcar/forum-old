					<p>Hello,</p><p>i was also looking for a lightweight podcatcher to use on my nslu2 (266mhz/32mb).</p><p>didn&#039;t plan to use much of the internal flash, but could not find a podcatcher/rss-reader that didn&#039;t use a full blown xml-parsing libary. bashpodder, as the name suggests, uses bash ... and also xsltproc. </p><p>the task of fetching a file, parsing some urls out of it, and then fetching these (incremental) seems quite simple, and since it runs on my dedicated machine i don&#039;t care much for metadata. so i thought a shell script would be best suited to do the trick, and gave it a shot. the results are stunning!</p><p>it turned out, that for about 25 out of the 27 casts i do follow now, the following grep pattern is just as good as any xml parser:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget $feed | grep -io &#039;http://[^ ]*\.\(mp3\|mp4\|avi\|mpg\|mpeg\|wmv\|ogg\)&#039;</code></pre></div><p>knowing this, i took some time to work out one-two-three shell scripts around it, to add a config file, write a log, make it cron-launchable, conveniently add new casts, and so on. also had some issues with my internet connection the other day (connections getting stalled and never timing out), so i gave it some extra thinking about restart logic in the cron-script and added command line switches to (not|only) fetch feeds and continue previous fetches.</p><p>one more feature i like about it: you can hook custom parsers (like the grep above) into it, doing any shell magic you like with the fetched xml/document, like wake-on-lan a device before fetching stuff from it, convert urls or rotate episodes. yeas! all that can be done with that one hook! there should be more! more hooks! yes, i&#039;ll code them when it&#039;s time for them to be coded. promise ;-)</p><p>allright, here&#039;s the code:</p><p><a href="http://github.com/isnok/podcatch-sh">http://github.com/isnok/podcatch-sh</a></p><p>enjoy!</p>									</div>
