					<p>Hi,</p><p>Just flashed an Asus WL-500gP with a self-built kamikaze image (using the buildroot, rev 8570) yesterday and everything is fine.</p><p>Today I tried the SDK-tbz2 that was generated in the process. But - surprise - it is only 4MB in size and does not contain the toolchain ?! A &quot;make&quot; in the kamikaze directory completed without any problems, so ?</p><p>I searched for the toolchain in the buildroot and found this discrepancy in rules.mk:<br />TOOLCHAIN_DIR:=$(TOPDIR)/staging_dir/toolchain-$(ARCH)_gcc$(GCCV)<br />results in my toolchain being installed in &quot;staging_dir/toolchain-mipsel_gcc3.4.6/&quot; where it obviously can be used by the buildroot itself.<br />However, the SDK build tars the &quot;STAGING_DIR&quot;, which is defined as<br />STAGING_DIR:=$(TOPDIR)/staging_dir/$(ARCH)<br />, staging_dir/mipsel here, resulting in missing compilers.</p><p>Did I do anything wrong, is this known to be broken or do I just have to provide more details ;-) ??</p><p>svn revision while building the firmware was 8570. This morning (Europe time) I updated the buildroot to 8571 and the problem still exists. Build environment is Gentoo, x86 (32-bit). For comparison, I compiled a whiterussian buildroot (from svn, default config, except setting to bcm-2.4 and Asus wl-500gP) resulting in the same problem.</p><p>I hope this information helps someone to identify my problem.<br />Thanks in advance,<br />Marius</p>									</div>
