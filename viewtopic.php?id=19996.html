					<p>Kamikaze 8.09 x86 ext2fs on thin client neoware e4000s. PPPOE, NAT and HTB. <br />It can work weeks without a problem but it can hangup twice a day. <br />I&#039;m not too good on Linux so i&#039;m asking you, there is a way to find out why it dies ?<br />There is a place in Linux where i can find more info on what is happening before it dies ?</p><p>Untill now i&#039;ve had him without keyboard and monitor but now it is connected to both, maybe i can find out something more. </p><p>When it dies, i can&#039;t find it on network but the lan led is flickering from time to time with the switch leds. However, no transfer on modem (or i didn&#039;t see it).</p>									</div>

					<p>For the same reason, the image on the monitor turns black after few minutes. Kind of a screen saver or something. Can i turn this off ? Meaning, to have something on the monitor always, until it dies ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you. I&#039;ll see how i can do that. If i don&#039;t manage it, i come back with some more questions.</p><p>Edit - I have a small HDD on this neoware (32Mb) with 10Mb free and i have also a stick installed and working on it. Maybe the logging would be simple if i use one of this nonvolatile memory ?</p><p>Using the crontab i get traffic statistics every our on my stick and it is working very nice.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Misuser</strong> on 25 Apr 2009, 15:40)</p>

					<p>Well, it just died. Again. Nothing on the monitor, nothing on the keyboard (i was hopping for something like lited leds for kernel panic). <br />Computer is unresponsive. Keyboard is unresponsive (no changing in caps or numlook leds after pressing their keys).</p><p>I was using some torrent for an our or so. Even so, it managed torrents from 3 users for days in a row. </p><p>I was connected to it with putty (from windows). And from the root acount i&#039;ve watched how it pings the gateway to have an ideea about latency. That window (putty) freezed and after a while i&#039;ve get some &#039;network error&#039; from putty.</p><p>Before putting this router to work i&#039;ve tested it few days. Few ours with memtest showed no problem.</p><p>Any ideea how to test if the problem is in the hardware ?</p><p>Anyway, it seems that these days i have some work to do (putting the old router back.. i hate it, i was enjoyng the new router)</p>									</div>

					<p>New info about the problem.</p><p>When i listen online radio, there is few seconds (up to a minute) when the radio still works but the rest of the router (and transfer via upnp) doesn&#039;t.<br />My anitivirus makes visible the upnp transfer on my bandwith metter (NetLimiter). There is like 4kb continuosly between computer and router. When router dies, that transfer (upnp) stops. And yet, like a minute or so, (and i&#039;m not talking about winamp cacheing) there is still transfer on an estabilished radio connection.</p><p>In the log there is nothing. I&#039;ve made it to log on the hdd and there is nothing on the momment when it dies.<br />Could it be something wrong with the miniupnpd package ? I have not enabled the upnp Log Output because it logs so much stuff that the net doesn&#039;t work well (increased lag). </p><p>Any suggestion ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Couldn&#039;t help lauthing at post about online radio.. Transfer dies simultaneously with router, and you hear to music only by means of buffering. You may try to switch it off in your radio player and look how will it work after that)</p>									</div>

After unpluging the eth cable, radio still works around 15 seconds.<br />I am sure about this &#039;radio still working&#039; because i&#039;m watching the graphic with data transfer of the programs and i can see what is working and what is not. And it seems there is kind of long time in which estabilished connection still works (it happen with CounterStrike too).</p><p>Today, the DC transfer died, the upnp transfer died, the radio was still receiving data and the router didn&#039;t respond to the ping. <br />The Netlimiter keeps separate recording on different programs.

I am going to try the -d option with miniupnpd to see if it makes a difference (maybe it will dye only miniupnpd ?)<br />I hope i&#039;m not going to have to try deactivating the upnp altoghether.. but someday i&#039;ll do that either.</p><p>Any suggestion ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Misuser</strong> on 7 Oct 2009, 16:27)</p>
