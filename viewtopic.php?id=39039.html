					<p>Hi.</p><p>I&#039;m working on porting <a href="http://www.sshguard.net/">sshguard</a> to work on openwrt to protect dropbear from attackers. I suspect this would be a useful package for others as well so I hope to eventually have it added to the openwrt packages feed.&nbsp; I successfully compiled sshguard as a package and can run the binary on my router (TP-Link 1043nd).&nbsp; sshguard requires some configuration of the firewall as well as the ability to read log files to detect attacker IPs.&nbsp; I have some quesitons pertaining to the best way to set up sshguard for the openwrt environment.</p><p>Firewall:<br />I compile sshguard with support for iptables.&nbsp; I am familiar with OpenBSD PF but still very new to iptables.&nbsp; sshguard requires some configuration of iptables so that it can add blocked IP addresses.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sshguard.net/docs/setup/firewall/netfilter-iptables/">Here</a>&#039;s the relevant docs.&nbsp; Where or how is the best place to add these firewall rules?&nbsp; Since firewall configurations can be highly customized depending on use cases, would it be best to leave out the firewall rules from my package and instead notify the user to read the sshguard docs and set up their firewall appropriately?</p><p>Log support:<br />sshguard supports reading log entries with two different methods.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.sshguard.net/docs/setup/getlogs/syslog/">&quot;older&quot; method</a> relies on configuring syslog to invoke sshguard directly or write entries to a fifo which is then piped into sshguard. However, I don&#039;t think this is an option as syslog.conf doesn&#039;t exist/work in openwrt.&nbsp; From reading the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/log.essentials">openwrt log documentation</a>, it looks like the easiest option that would work by default (at least on my 1043nd under backfire) is to pipe logread -f into sshguard. This would be similar to <a href="http://www.sshguard.net/docs/setup/getlogs/raw-file/">&quot;raw log&quot; support</a> in sshguard. I think I could create an init script for this pretty easily.&nbsp; However, a problem with this setup arises when a user configures their syslog to output to file instead of the ram buffer.&nbsp; See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system#system">OpenWrt system configuration</a> option log_type.&nbsp; In this case, my experimentation shows that logread no longer works!&nbsp; The user would then have to somehow change the service scripts to cat /var/log/messages (or uci log_file variable) to sshguard.</p><p>To sum up my post, I&#039;m looking for how I can package sshguard so that it works best under the majority of &quot;default&quot; setups but remains easily configurable if the user has a custom firewall setup or log system.</p><p>You can view my progress <a href="https://github.com/slarew/openwrt_slarew">here</a>.</p><p>Thanks ahead for your thoughts!</p><p>Stephen</p>									</div>

You could go for leaving out the rules and point out to the user where to find the info, but i would be even nicer if your package created those rules based on a config file in /etc/config/.</p>									</div>

					<p>You may have to modify the source code to protect openwrt against ssh attack, because openwrt uses dropbear by default as sshd, but the ssh log for bad password attempt can&#039;t be recognized by sshguard (not in its attack pattern database).</p>									</div>
