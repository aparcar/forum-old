I think I&#039;m getting acquainted with the linux patch system.</p><p>2.) Why not reduce the default value of 5 days to something less? I know some established TCP connections could concievably go that long without traffic, but in reality there are probably other &#039;kills&#039; along the line when a connection has been idle that long. Perhaps 6 hours is too little though, and 1 day is more appropriate. All I know is that my connection table would fill up after a couple days of p2p use since many connections apparently weren&#039;t being closed properly.</p><p>3.) Is there another way to configure this (other than an &#039;echo X &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/...&#039; at startup)?

					<p>You&#039;ll have to show us what you did with sysctl so we can tell you why it didn&#039;t work. The sysctl values are written at startup; chances are you didn&#039;t write a proper sysctl.conf entry.</p>									</div>

					<p>mbm:<br />I hope I was doing something wrong with sysctl.conf, but I dunno what. My variables were defined in the way the directory structure is layed out (with /proc/sys as base). I tried serveral variations, that&#039;s what led me to conclude it just wasn&#039;t working. I noticed in the source code that it seems like it ought to work.. </p><p>&lt;code&gt;<br />net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established=3600<br />&lt;/code&gt;</p><p>stephen:<br />My problem with echo&#039;ing to the /proc entries is because that seems to be the purpose of sysctl.conf, and it not working made me wonder if netfilter was picking up the changes to the /proc entries. And since the /proc entries weren&#039;t persisting across a reboot, I was even further wary that it was actually working. Of course, I could have went to the trouble to find out... but the whole thing seems hackish.</p><p>My argument for default to something less than 5 days, or at least allowing for configuring of this in the build would be that most users need support for the rigors of p2p networking more than do 5 day long idle connections. Of course, I understand the rationale for leaving it to the default value, especially since OpenWrt can be built for so many different platforms, including ones with much more resources available. </p><p>....</p><p>Mostly my whole post is useless.. but I was actually kinda happy to have created my first patch for OpenWrt, even if it doesn&#039;t really make any &#039;real&#039; code changes <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />. Its taken me a while to get up to speed with linux development. mbm confused me and sent me all to hell the other day, before I realized that by &#039;kernel&#039; he was including kernel mode drivers. I couldn&#039;t understand why you would merge JFFS2 into the &#039;kernel&#039;. To me, the file system drivers aren&#039;t part of the &#039;kernel&#039;. Anyway, until having played with things myself, this jargon barrier makes it hard to be &#039;told&#039; what is going on <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p><p>.....</p>									</div>
