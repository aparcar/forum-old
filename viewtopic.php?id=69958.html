					<p>Hi,</p><p>i haven ADSL router (Rouer A) which provides Internet connectivity. Then i have an OpenWRT Router (Router B) wirelessly connected to Router A as &quot;Routed Client&quot; as explained here &quot;OpenWrt Wiki » Welcome to OpenWrt » HOWTOs » Client Mode Wireless&quot; Also, another ADSL router configured as bridge AP (Router C) is connected to Router B via ethernet cable and also provides WiFi connectivity via ExtWiFi SSID. Lastly, i have another OpenWRT router (Router D) also configured as Routed Client and wirelessly connected to Router C through ExtWiFi SSID.</p><p>Router A is on 192.168.1.0/24 network. DHCP is enabled.&nbsp; <br />Router B configured as Routed Client is on 192.168.2.0/24 network. NAT and DHCP are enabled.<br />Router C acting as Bridged AP is on 192.168.2.0/24 network. NAT and DHCP are disabled.&nbsp; <br />Router D configured as Routed Client is on 192.168.3.0/24 network. NAT and DHCP are enabled.&nbsp; </p><p>The thing is i&#039;m looking to this docs &quot;OpenWrt Wiki » Welcome to OpenWrt » HOWTOs » Client Mode Wireless&quot; looking to different setups so i can wirelessly connect Router D to Router C while disabling NAT and DHCP on Router D so it could also belong to 192.168.2.0/24 network.</p><p>So i&#039;m wondering, does anyone know how to setup Router D so it can be wirelessly connected to Router D while disabling NAT and forwarding DHCP requests to Router B? I would like to be able to transparently reach computers connected to Router B and Router D and vice versa.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>So, you already have router D connected to router C, using the &quot;routed client mode&quot;. What you want to do now looks like the &quot;bridged client mode&quot;. In general, you will need to use relayd, or depending on your hardware, try one of the other variants: WET mode, WDS mode, ...</p>									</div>
