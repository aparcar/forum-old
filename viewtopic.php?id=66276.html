					<p>It does not sound like that router is supported by any developer, or is very popular. You should track down whoever wrote that wiki article, as they seem to have a router and have worked with it. They could answer your questions (obviously).</p><p>IPSec is supported via the StrongSwan packages on OpenWRT.</p><p>TP-Link has some unique checks on their images when loaded via the web user interface, so you are almost certainly right to say that loading that asus image isn&#039;t going to work. You would likely need to TFTP boot from the uboot serial console. Too bad the wiki page didn&#039;t seem to have any info or a log showing how to do that.</p>									</div>
