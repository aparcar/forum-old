					<p>If the WAN interface is configured as DHCP client, then you must change the configuration in the DHPC server (your android phone, if I understood your post correctly). You could change to a fixed configuration and set those parameters yourself, but then you will lose all internet connection.</p><p>On the other hand, I think you should have a look to the &quot;client mode wireless&quot; at: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a></p>									</div>
