					<p>Two recent changes in my build &amp; testing process:</p><p>1) I have bought also WNDR3700v2 with 16 MB flash, as long as they are on the market (before the Broadcom-based v3 will retire v2). I am switching that to be my main router, so in future I am daily running the v2 firmware builds myself, not the traditional v1 ones. I will keep also the v1 as a secondary router, possibly with WDS activated, so also the v1 firmware will get regular usage. (There is no practical difference in the firmwares, as the build process just makes both versions from identical kernel etc.)</p><p>2) I figured out an easy and secure way to attach my own configuration to the flashable firmware. I have been using a USB stick to store the needed files for both Backfire and Trunk, but I wanted to simplify the process, as I have been regularly switching between trunk &amp; Backfire. </p><p>In practice I only need a couple of config files, as all other defaults are tailored to my needs already in the built firmware openly available in my FTP directory. The list of my config files is short: /etc/config/dhcp, firewall, luci_statistics, qos, wireless and radvd, /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys for having SSH key-based authentication and /etc/vsftpd.conf for FTP server.</p><p>I package those files with tar, separately for v1 &amp; v2 and backfire &amp; trunk, 4 filesets in total, each has size less than 4 kB.<br/>That tar.gz file is then encrypted with ccrypt and included in the firmware (e.g. /etc/v1trunk.cpt and v2trunk.cpt in the trunk build.)<br/>I am including the needed ccrypt package in the build.<br/>Additionally, there is a short shell script for easy unpacking the settings file to /etc<br/>This adds a few kilobytes to the firmware size, but not much. In practice, the size of the flashed firmware remained the same.</p><p>The unpacking script /etc/hnsettings.sh :<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
cp -f $1 /tmp/HNsettings.cpt
if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq 0 ] ; then
  ccdecrypt -vf /tmp/HNsettings.cpt
  if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq 0 ] ; then
    tar -xzv -f /tmp/HNsettings -C /etc
  fi
fi</code></pre></div><p>Screenshot of a script run:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# cd /etc/
root@OpenWrt:/etc# ./hnsettings.sh v2trunk.cpt
Enter decryption key:
Decrypting /tmp/HNsettings.cpt

config/radvd
config/network
config/firewall
config/luci_statistics
config/qos
config/wireless
config/dhcp
dropbear/
dropbear/authorized_keys
vsftpd.conf
root@OpenWrt:/etc#</code></pre></div><p>This enables me to pretty easily restore all settings after a flash. Of course, should I change some settings permanently, I need to rebuild those encrypted settings archives.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 5 Sep 2011, 20:28)</p>

Checking my v1 config, I don&#039;t see any other hardware dependencies, and it looks like simply deleting /etc/config/wireless from the settings tarball would be an easy solution. This would give the install a chance to probe for other capabilities and initialize the cards cleanly, then it&#039;s just two tabs to finish setup. I&#039;ll give it a try if I do end up making the switch.</p>									</div>

There are only rare changes to Backfire.

					<p>I too prefer the Backfire version, and have been running hnyman&#039;s various backfire builds for months. One very annoying behavior in Trunk is that the upgrade scenario doesn&#039;t preserve all the settings - the router IP network always resets to the default for instance (192.168.1.x), and I have to manually correct it. I guess if I never upgraded the version, I wouldn&#039;t care, but that&#039;s kind of the point of running OpenWRT. :-)</p><p>Bottom line, as a pure router package I don&#039;t think you can go wrong with either version. The core package is simple and stable, and all the opkg&#039;s install just fine.</p><p>Is this a good time to again say thanks for maintaining these builds? Much appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>No changes in the actual functionality during the month, but I have rebuilt the whole thing. I noticed that there was unnecessary bloat from old dependencies, (as the .config file does not remove dependent packages when you remove the one originally causing the other package to get included.)</p><p>To avoid going through &#039;make menuconfig&#039; and manually selecting all the things when making the .config cleanup, I pruned the .config file leaving only the needed settings &amp; packages and made a file &#039;.config.init&#039; out of that. This .config.init file can be used to overwrite .config and then run &#039;make defconfig&#039; to get the the dependent packages and platform-related defaults added there.</p><p>Example of my trunk .config.init:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx=y

					<p>Interesting idea. I&#039;ve pretty much had it at going through menuconfig by hand and selecting all my packages. Can you provide more details on your build process?</p>									</div>

					<p>My normal scripts are here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=140330#p140330">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 30#p140330</a><br/>Basically updating sources and feeds, running defconfig and then menuconfig to make any changes, if necessary.</p><p>But should I want to start building the .config from a clean slate, I can replace .config with that short .config.init before the build process, and &quot;make defconfig&quot; would then fix it by adding the dependent modules. After make defconfig, the new .config is long (and identical to the old full .config before cleanup).</p><p>I started by grepping away from .config all the #lines, and then looked carefully about the dependencies between the remaining lines (packages). I removed those lines that would be automatically included by having another package. For example, having &#039;luci-app-wol&#039; automatically includes the underlying &#039;etherwake&#039; module, etc. (Finally I had to add one # line to exclude wpad-mini as the full wpad is already there and wpad-mini is not needed, but as a device default it might get otherwise to the build config). </p><p>In practice, those modules that I had earlier manually selected in menuconfig, are left in .config.init. There might still be 1-2 unnecessary lines there, but it looks short enough already now. (For example, luci-proto-6x4 already selects 6in4 and 6to4, so those two are unnecessary in principle.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 31 Oct 2011, 10:55)</p>

					<p>Did you remove the &quot;ntpclient&quot; package intentionally? I installed the wndr3700 (non-v2) 28681 build and had to manually install the ntp stuff manually. I&#039;m taking a look for differences and noticed some changes in the default kmods, were there any other changes/deletions?</p><p>New build looks pretty nice overall. The web interface is a little slicker and has some nice improvements.</p><p>[edit] Hmm, I notice luci-app-ntpc is gone altogether so I&#039;m guessing this is a change in the openwrt distro.

					<p>Well good riddance to rdate, but the lack of a migration for the ntpclient settings to /etc/config/system is a small annoyance. In any case, after editing it by hand, all seems well - the &quot;Time Synchronization&quot; frame is populated in System-&gt;System and ntpd is running.</p><p>I take it I can get rid of /etc/config/timeserver and /etc/config/ntpclient now?</p>									</div>
