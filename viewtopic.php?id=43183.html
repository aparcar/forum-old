					<p>Thanks for your answer.<br />My current modem is : <a href="http://www.technicolor.com/en/hi/digital-home/mediaaccess/dsl/advanced-service-gateways/vdsl/technicolor-tg789vn">http://www.technicolor.com/en/hi/digita … or-tg789vn</a></p><p>For your questions :<br />1. VDSL2 would be nice (it&#039;s coming to France soon)<br />2. Annex A (europe)<br />3. VOIP -&gt; my actual modem register to a sip server, I plug my phone on the modem and I works<br />4. My ISP is OVH.com<br />5. I&#039;d like to have full control of the modem. And run some scripts on it. </p><p>OpenWRT seems to be the right thing to choose, I only need the good hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>1. VDSL2-Support for Lantiq chipset is on the way, but we are not there yet. Cf. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.lantiq">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.lantiq</a><br />2a. There are at least 6 OpenWrt-supported WLAN+ADSL2+-Devices: <a href="http://geizhals.de/?cat=wlanroutmod&amp;xf=758_OpenWrt&amp;sort=p|Preisvergleich%20DE:%20WLAN-Router%20mit%20Modem">http://geizhals.de/?cat=wlanroutmod&amp … it%20Modem</a><br />2b. Is there such a price comparison for France? So far, only geizhals has OpenWrt-filter. But it is only DE; AT, UK and PL.<br />3. A VoIP-Telefone&nbsp; uses RJ-45, so this isn&#039;t a hardware issue. VoIP-Software is available in the openwrt-repos. Howtos may be available. ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Only the FritzBoxes use to have:&nbsp; FXO and FXS ports: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_service_%28telecommunications%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_ex … cations%29</a> sadly no picture afaik its for analog port</p><p>Remotely manageable (TR-069, TR-104, TR-098, TR-111)<br />That is a problem me thinks. There is FreeCWMP which supports TR-069.<br />Please also note the specs for those protocols. They allow for a lot of (unnecessary) things.</p><p>So you have full control, but you ISP as well.

					<p>TR-069 is a cool idea. Like pdf is or UEFI or Secure boot.</p><p>Sadly the specs of TR-069 contain a lot of stuff, that the master can do. This unnecessary stuff ain&#039;t being used, because ISP has better things to do, than bullshit around with their property (which happens to be inside of you home and not just give you Internet-uplink but also manages your WLAN), but ISP could do.</p><p>Now thanks to FreeCWMP, you could set up a crippled TR-069 client, one that does not allow for all the unnecessary stuff. And this probably would work, since the ISP is not all interested in the unnecessary part of the specs. Also, they probably dont make their TR-069-master check if the unnecessary part of the specs are well implemented in the client and work as intended (by whom actually?).</p><p>However: that is not what the specification sais!</p><p>Fazit1: Afaik TR-069 is doable in OpenWrt. Yes, crippled TR-069 is doable as well.<br />Fazit2: Once you have bullshit specs, no FLOSS software can help.</p>									</div>
