					<p>They both contain many of the same packages. LEDE was built from OpenWrt trunk, from a few months back, but has branched from there.

					<p>Would it also be possible to just download all the corresponding packages you built/complied for a specific release and then maybe place them on a USB drive or something. Then, down the road if a user decides that they did want to install one of those packages (knowing surely it wouldn&#039;t be available anymore as you would have recompiled for a new build by then and that&#039;s what you would be hosting. Unless you do like you said in the prior and publish packages for older builds), could a user just change the path in the software path to reflect hard paths for the repository. Then install directly off a USB drive or something?</p><p>Like /mnt/package_repo/core etc.....

					<p>The packages can be scp&#039;d to the router.. Otherwise I think it is relegated to pulling packages via http.</p><p>There may be a way to just increment a directory on the webserver with every new build, and reflect that change in the build itself. This way the image loaded would always be pointing to the right packages. I do have plenty of space on the webserver, so no problem there.

					<p>Hi @davidc502. I&#039;ve been testing your latest build today for the first time. Great work thank you. I have a couple of suggestions.</p><ul><li><p>If the Ash shell could have a history file ~/.ash_history to remember the last shell commands typed even after logout. In the busybox compiled .config:<br />CONFIG_FEATURE_EDITING_HISTORY=255<br />CONFIG_FEATURE_EDITING_SAVEHISTORY=y<br />CONFIG_FEATURE_REVERSE_SEARCH=y</p></li><li><p>I use OpenVPN with OpenWrt to send all my LAN device traffic through a VPN. The latest SQM &#039;cake&#039; qdist from the bufferbloat repo makes a significant difference to the responsiveness of my router traffic with the VPN. With kmod-sched-cake and tc-adv I can configure SQM to achieve an A+ connection quality and bufferbloat rating on dslreports.com/speedtest. There are some instructions here <a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake/#installing-cake-out-of-tree-on-openwrt-rough-instructions">https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/co … structions</a> but these require kernel recompilation. If you can manage to add cake to a future build please let me know and I can post instructions for others using your build to optimise responsiveness. With your current build I can see the PIE qdist in the SQM lua interface but not cake.</p></li><li><p>Add tcpdump package for packet capture and troubleshooting.<br /></p><ul></ul></li></ul><p>Great work and thanks again David.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iancd</strong> on 30 Oct 2016, 22:37)</p>

					<p>Hi David,</p><p>Can you build igmpproxy too please, as it is needed for UDP multicast traffic such as BTTV. Would be handy for my current project. <br />If it is easier for me to build it myself, let me know.</p>									</div>

They need to come from one source. When I started, I thought builds would be shared a perhaps a few people would try it out, and that would be the end of it. However, that&#039;s not what happened as there have been thousands of downloads. Out of those downloads, it&#039;s unknown how many people actually installed or continue to run the builds. </p><p>Over the past year I&#039;ve attempted to build all packages, but have never managed to make it happen, but it&#039;s still on the horizon. It could be that I need a new machine with a lot more power and storage space. As AMD is coming out with a new processor at the end or perhaps the beginning of next year, I&#039;m hoping to jump on board and see what I can do building the entire enchilada. </p><p>If you are interested in building your own, I can relay the basic instructions to get you going. It&#039;s really not hard to do.</p>									</div>
