					<p>Hi folks!</p><p>I am new to openWRT!</p><p>I just bought a TP-Link TL-WDR3600 and installed latest openWRT on it. It rocks!</p><p>I installed with no issues and find this firmware to be great! Good job!</p><p>I also read that the openWRT community is very friendly at answering noob questions like this one:</p><p>My problem now is that I have a tenager kid. If I do not block his internet access during the night he will not resist the temptation to play games online.</p><p>Now, my problem is that this teenager is a computer nerd. So if I restrict a MAC address he will create a virtual adapter on his computer with another MAC address and bypass security. Same thing if I restrict by IP. He will manually change his adapter IP.</p><p>So I basically need openWRT to be CLOSED by default and all rules to be set to REJECT and then specifically allow a handful of MAC addresses... mine for 24/7 and restrict his by nights on weekdays.</p><p>The problem is that I find openWRT to be configured exactly the opposite way (everything allowed) and recipies I found are for blocking MACs or IP addresses.</p><p>The difficulty is that in openWRT, NAT is used for the router to provide internet access. So I need to understand clearly how to deny everything and then how to allow MACs for a given time frame.</p><p>By the way, I would like to block both LAN and wireless connections from his devices at&nbsp; given times</p><br /><p>Please help!</p><br /><p>Regards<br />PS. Probably this same question was asked in the past. If so I humbly request a link to the answer/recipe.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pastito</strong> on 25 Dec 2015, 10:50)</p>
