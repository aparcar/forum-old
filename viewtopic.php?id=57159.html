					<p>I just registered with wiki.openwrt.org. I got an email back with a username and password, but logging in isn&#039;t working. Is the login system broken in general? Do I have to wait longer before I can log in? What&#039;s going on here. (The username btw is ewtoombs, the same as my forum username.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like I fixed it. There was a password reset feature that I hadn&#039;t seen before. I used it. Now, my account is officially online. That redirect issue should still be hunted down and solved, though, even if it isn&#039;t critical.</p>									</div>
