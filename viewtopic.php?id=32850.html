					<p>What am I missing?</p><p>[OpenVPN is running on an internal computer, not directly on the OpenWRT router itself.]</p><p>I&#039;m working on getting the rest of my internal network to understand how to route back incoming openvpn traffic. i.e. external client connects to my internal openvpn server. Then through that tunnel connect to other internal machines. For the moment, just working on pings / getting the other internal machines to understand to route their openvpn client responding packets back via the openvpn server. So, for the moment, just working on the internal machines ability to ping the openvpn server ip, and failing.</p><p>Have local (XP) VPN server, say:<br />- local nic 192.168.100.1/24<br />- openvpnvirtnic 192.168.200.1/24</p><p>Can ping 200.1.</p><p>On OpenWRT home router, say lan 100.250, have route 200.0/24 -&gt; 100.1.</p><p>ssh&#039;ing in, it can ping 200.1.</p><p>On another local machine:</p><p>Ping&#039;ing 200.1 returns &quot;Reply from 100.250: Destination port unreachable.&quot;</p><p>If I &#039;route add 200.0 mask 255.255.255.0 100.1&#039; (to this local machine) ping works.</p><br /><p>What am I missing?<br />It&#039;s like I can&#039;t go in and out of the same (OpenWRT) interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks very kindly, that got it.</p><p>So the switch is not &#039;just&#039; a switch, and firewall rules apply. Interesting. Good to know. Thanks.</p><p>I tried a rule of accept lan/lan, 0.0.0.0/0, 200.0/24, but it didn&#039;t have any noticeable effect. [Ah! Probably because packets were rejected already by that time - thus the change you suggested!]</p><p>So, to be &#039;as secure as I was&#039;, I suppose I should now put in accept forward rules only for my internal networks, and deny all other forwarding.</p><p>Thanks so much for the help.</p>									</div>
