					<p>Hello :-)</p><p>Which could be the reasons because when I scan the air it shows me open stations with more than 60% of signal (sometimes 80% or more) and when I try to connect them in client mode it shows 0% signal in the link? Sometimes it connects during 2-3 seconds with 60% of signal and then disconnects and shows 0%.</p><p>I am using a TP-Link TL-WDR3500 with latest trunk.</p><p>Thanks a lot :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kokoliso</strong> on 18 Nov 2014, 01:28)</p>

When I connect to another AP like client, one that is a few meters away from the router, it connects without issue. But when I try to connect to APs that are far away (2,5 km) with a dish, it shows me strong signals in scan but then I tray to join and I get 0% of signal.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>danymarc wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>And are you setting the password correct in case of Capitals</p></blockquote></div><p>It is open.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>danymarc wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>And instead of scanning write the ssid</p></blockquote></div><p>The same.</p><p>Thanks :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Bridged networks need&nbsp; relayd pkg installed to repeat a signal, from another AP or router.<br />MODE 2: REPEATER, DIFFERENT NETWORK has to be in a dif subnet, if the open AP you are connecting uses Gateway 192.168.1.0 your WDR3500 has to be in 192.168.0.1<br />Read Repeater configurations here!

					<p>Thanks but was not a bridging problem. Was a trees problem. I moved the antenna to the roof of a neighbor with a cleaner vision of the AP and connect it with signals of more than 80%.</p><p>Thank you very much :-)</p>									</div>
