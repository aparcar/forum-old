					<p>Hi,<br />Can someone point me in the right direction as I really don&#039;t even know what to search for.<br />My goal is to have OpenWrt connection to an exisiting wireless network (say HomeWifi). Install samba on OpenWrt, have two pc&#039;s connect to HomeWifi and then access OpenWrt samba share. <br />I think I&#039;m okay on the samba part. But how to I connect OpenWrt to an existing network and keep that connection active on startup?<br />I also do not have any further goals with OpenWrt just a samba share. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>That would of been toooo easy. It is called a pocket wifi and it&#039;s basically a 4G modem with wifi.<br />Anyways I finally cracked it. I really don&#039;t know what I was doing wrong but it just started to work.<br />I removed all wireless connections (network --&gt; wifi) and deleted<br />Then network --&gt; wifi --&gt; scan --&gt; selected my wifi .... and setup as client<br />Checked through bash and it connected to my wireless network. <br />Then slowly worked through the next problems until it was sharing an ext4 thumb drive.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually as I think about it more. Reboots of the router helped greatly. Make a change apply and save and then reboot. Then it seemed to work more often</p>									</div>
