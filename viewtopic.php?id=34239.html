					<p>So i installed openwrt on it and so it worked ok, after installation i start configure it and change something in the lan configurations, so the connection closed and admin panel disappeared. Now i cant connect to it.</p><p>The interesting thing is that the wi-fi is still online and also when plug in it into macbook in the macs connection options it appears and even gives ip to mac via dhcp... So does any one have any suggestion on how to reincarnate my friend Asus WL600G?</p>									</div>
