					<p>Hello, </p><p>on one of my OpenWRT boxes (brcm-2.4, Kamikaze 7.07), eth0.0 never got its IPv6 address on boot-up, because the ipv6 module wasn&#039;t loaded when the network coldplug in /etc/init.d/boot fired up. </p><p>Therefore, I reordered the stuff as follows:<br />1. load all modules except for wl and wlcompat<br />2. load netfilter rules (aka firewall)<br />3. do coldplug<br />4. load wl and wlcompat (will cause hotplug to launch wl0, so we can&#039;t load them at point 1.)</p><p>I did this by separating the network coldplug into /etc/init.d/coldplug_network, and by killing /etc/modules.d/30-brcm-wl and /etc/modules.d/50-wlcompat and loading them with another init script /etc/init.d/load_wl. </p><p>While you can argue that inferfaces being up for a couple of moments without the firewall loaded isn&#039;t a great security risk, you should consider making network coldplug happen after module load. (Currently, /etc/init.d/boot does network coldplug first, and module load afterwards / in parallel.)</p><p>Except for that, Kamikaze has worked like a charm over here, including WDS with WPA-PSK. Thanks for your great work!</p><p>Regards,<br />Milan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mh</strong> on 1 Aug 2007, 16:56)</p>
