					<p>I try to give most informations possible about my current network layout and what I want to achieve.</p><p>Right now I&#039;m sharing 1Mb/24Mb assymetric landline connection with about 10 computers in 4 floor building using dlink DIR-655 (A2 hardware, 1.11 firmware version) router. All clients are connected wirelessly. Both modem and router are on the second floor. Obviously there are some signal issues on the 4th floor.</p><p>Right now I&#039;m waiting for the soekris board to be shipped on which I will set up pfsense to manage all the network traffic, DHCP, QoS and all the fancy stuff. The soekris board have no wirelles on board so I want to use my DIR-655 with it for wireless connectivity. I also have 2 spare Linksys routers (WRT54GL and WRT54GS). So in total I have 1 soekris box with powerfull routing capabilities and 3 wireless routers (DIR-655, WRT54GL and WRT54GS).</p><p>My aim now is to make pfsense responsible for all the routing and remaining routers for just wireless connectivity and extension of the wireless signal.</p><p>I want to set one router right behind the pfsense box and 2 remaining routers on the 4th floor to extend the signal. I can&#039;t connect both floors with the cable so extending signal would have to be done on the air.</p><p>My main concern right now is compatibility between 2nd and 4th floor routers in a bridge mode. I can flash one of the linksys with OPEN-WRT and upgrade the software on my DIR-655 and make somehow wireless bridge extension for the 4th floor.</p><p>What you guys think would be the best arrangement for the routers in this layout? Which one should sit behind pfsense and which remaining ones should be used for bridging. Since all the machines are connecting wirelessly I need all the routers just for the wireless connectivity.</p><p>Would it be possible to make them transparent in the network and responsible only for assigning wireless clients and bridging itself?</p><p>Any input would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Not exactly cause I don&#039;t want to limit the capacity of the network thats why 2 routers on the 4th floor. One just to talk with root router, the other one just to talk with wireless clients which are out of range of root router. Both of them connected via ethernet cable.</p>									</div>
