					<p>Hello,</p><p>I converted my tl-wr1043nd v2.1 to open-wrt once a release was finally available for this specific new model of tl. Upgrade went smooth, and it is working perfect, as expected, for all my lan ans wireless devices at home (ios, android, kindle, wii, etc.).<br />However, the only device, and most important one, that wifi is not working well is my personal mobile phone - Motorola razar xt890i (intel inside) running android 4.1.2.<br />The wireless of this specific device worked perfectly well prior to installing open-wrt, and it is working very well anywhere else. Symptoms:<br /> * I am able to connect, and get a strong signal.<br /> * Upon connecting after being disconnected for a long time, it works OK for few seconds<br /> * Speed reduce to nothing, and communication hang<br /> * I tried to upgrade to the latest release of open-wrt that came out few days ago, but it didn&#039;t help...</p><p>Questions<br /> 1. Did anyone else with a similar device had such issues?<br /> 2. How can I trace within the open-wrt what is going on and try to resolve it?<br /> 3. Is there any package that can be installed to allow me better debugging?<br /> 3.</p>									</div>
