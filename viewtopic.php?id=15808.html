					<p>Hi !</p><p>I&#039;m connected to the internet but i also have serveral subnets with own domain names...<br />I also want do have only one dns in my network (DNS for these othernets are done in another net)<br />So i get my DNS from my ISP, that means on the kamikaze box i&#039;m not able to resolve internel hostnames at all.<br />Is it possible to configure dnsmasq that way, that in common it uses IPS dns and for domain xxx.net and zzz.net it uses an internal DNS server ?</p><br /><p>Ciao Gerd</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Is it possible to configure dnsmasq that way, that in common it uses IPS dns and for domain xxx.net and zzz.net it uses an internal DNS server ?</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes, check out the -S option in the <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html">dnsmasq man page</a>-</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>-S, --local, --server=[/[&lt;domain&gt;]/[domain/]][&lt;ipaddr&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;][@&lt;source-ip&gt;|&lt;interface&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;]]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Specify IP address of upstream servers directly. Setting this flag does not suppress reading of /etc/resolv.conf, use -R to do that. If one or more optional domains are given, that server is used only for those domains and they are queried only using the specified server. This is intended for private nameservers: if you have a nameserver on your network which deals with names of the form xxx.internal.thekelleys.org.uk at 192.168.1.1 then giving the flag -S /internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1 will send all queries for internal machines to that nameserver, everything else will go to the servers in /etc/resolv.conf. An empty domain specification, // has the special meaning of &quot;unqualified names only&quot; ie names without any dots in them. A non-standard port may be specified as part of the IP address using a # character. More than one -S flag is allowed, with repeated domain or ipaddr parts as required.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also permitted is a -S flag which gives a domain but no IP address; this tells dnsmasq that a domain is local and it may answer queries from /etc/hosts or DHCP but should never forward queries on that domain to any upstream servers. local is a synonym for server to make configuration files clearer in this case.</p></blockquote></div><p>Hope this helps,<br />Charlie</p>									</div>
