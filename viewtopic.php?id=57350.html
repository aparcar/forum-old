					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Been using OpenWRT on my WNDR3800 for years now and decided to bless a WNR2000 with the same. Only use it as an AP but i like to tinker. I was moving from DD-WRT on it so not as simple as it could have been. </p><p>Anyway, followed a thread explaining how to &quot;Break&quot; the router with Telnet so that it would wait at boot for a flash. Flashed the netgear firmware using TFTP2 but it didnt boot. From there i decided not to bother going via Netgear offical firmware and just flash OpenWRT using TFTP2. That worked better but was missing LUCI and becuase it;s not the main router it wasnt connected to the internet to allow me to download packages.</p><p>Then decided to build my own image. Might as well....</p><p>Setup a Linux VM and built the image using the command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make image PROFILE=Broadcom-mips74k-wl PACKAGES=&quot;luci -firewall -ppp -ppp-mod-pppoe -kmod-ppp -kmod-pppoe -kmod-pppox -ip6tables -odhcp6c -kmod-ipv6 -kmod-ip6tables -kmod-nf-ipt6&quot;</code></pre></div><p>The reason i took a lot of the packages above out is to reduce the size of the image for flash, which i believe needs to be under 3.3MB, which it was, just, after removing those packages.</p><p>I expected that those packages wouldn&#039;t be needed for an AP, but i may have removed some thing that is needed.</p><p>What happens is, when i boot the router i get one response on ping, then nothing for a moment, then 4 responses, then another gap before 5 or 6 more responses then nothing. The unit is on and can be re-flashed by shorting pins. </p><p>Just trying to figure out where i&#039;m going wrong. Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p><p>Many thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wriggerz</strong> on 21 May 2015, 17:15)</p>

					<p>Ok, updated the topic as it&#039;s become more of a general query as to how to get CC setup on a WNR2000v2....</p><p>Decided to go back to the available download here: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/mips74k/openwrt-brcm47xx-mips74k-netgear-wnr2000v2-squashfs.chk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … uashfs.chk</a></p><p>Which is lacking LUCI. So i configured my laptop to shares it&#039;s wireless connection with the router and did the usual &quot;opkg update&quot; and &quot;opkg install luci&quot; but it comes up with the error below:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install luci

The opkg list needs downloading to install luci... haha!</p><p>I read that removing packages from something pre-built wont free up space and i have to build an image, which brings me back round to the original post. When i try to build an image, removing packages i think i won&#039;t need, the firmware flashes but the router becomes inaccessible. Pings a few times but cannot be connected to using telnet or SSH and a pin short is required to reflash.</p><p>The Image Builder i&#039;m using is this one: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/mips74k/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-brcm47xx-mips74k.Linux-x86_64.tar.bz2">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … 64.tar.bz2</a></p><p>One thing i will say is that i was able to bring up the LUCI login page at the time it was responding to pings, but that was only for a matter of seconds. </p><p>Can&#039;t figure it out...</p><p>As always, any suggestions would be great. Not an expert but happy to learn.</p><p>Going to do a search for a pre-built community image, if not, maybe a list of packages i can remove during build.</p><p>Happy Friday guys!</p>									</div>

					<p>Further update....</p><p>Tried flashing latest version of BB, reading somewhere that all versions of BB come with LUCI.</p><p>Downloaded this: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm47xx/mips74k/openwrt-wnr2000v2-squashfs.chk">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … uashfs.chk</a></p><p>But when flashed the router reboots in to what looks like telnet mode, but cant connect via telnet and carries on responding to pings. No web interface. and it has an IP of 192.168.1.1. After 5 minutes rebooted it by pulling the power and when it booted back up it doesn&#039;t respond to pings but still looks like it;s waiting for a flash. Green power LED blinking...</p><p>Throughout all of this i have been flashing both directly, and via web interface on the netgear firmware. Neither seem to work.</p><p>So far the only one that works is the Pre-built CC build linked in the above post.</p><p>Will keep at it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hopefully someone will see this and can offer advice.... I really dont think i&#039;m doing anything wrong (famous last words).</p><p>So i started from scratch, built a new image with the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make image PROFILE=Broadcom-mips74k-wl PACKAGES=&quot;luci -iptables -ip6tables -kmod-ip6tables -kmod-ipt-conntrack -kmod-ipt-core -kmod-ipt-nat -ppp -ppp-mod-pppoe -kmod-ipv6 -kmod-nf-conntrack -kmod-nf-conntrack6 -kmod-nf-ipt -kmod-nf-ipt6 -kmod-nf-nat -kmod-nf-nathelper -kmod-ppp -kmod-pppoe -kmod-pppox -firewall -odhcp6c&quot;</code></pre></div><p>Like i said, this is really only going to be an AP, hence the reason for removing so many packages, trying to make room for luci.</p><p>Now the image was below the maximum size and flashes fine, and what i;ve noticed happens with all images apart from the pre-compiled version (without luci) is that it responds to pings immedaitely after turning the unit on for a couple of seconds, then stops for a moment, then responds again, at which point i can bring the login page in a browser, but just as the login box appears the unit stops responding to pings and i cant login.</p><p>Do i need luci-ssl?? Was trying to save space be leaving it out.</p><p>I&#039;ll build one with it in and test.</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t need luci-ssl. I would however leave out LuCi altogether. For an AP, configuring it over SSH is not that difficult.</p><p>Sure, it might be a hurdle if you don&#039;t feel comfortable with the command line but you can check your WNDR3800&#039;s configuration for pointers on how to replicate it on what you need.</p><p>There are instructions on the wiki on setup with and without LuCI: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap.</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply Borromini.</p><p>Configuring using CLI will be a last resort. While I&#039;m happy to set it up that way I do like having a UI I can log in to. And while I&#039;m a beginner I have configured openvpn using CLI on the WNDR3800 so I&#039;m sure I could do it.</p><p>Before I do that.... There&#039;s a warning on the Image Builder wiki, for AA I think, saying if you use the PACKAGES option libuci won&#039;t be installed, could that be the issue here? I doubt it, but do you know if there&#039;s a way to see what packages an image is made up of without installing it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Winning!!!</p><p>I can&#039;t tell you all how proud i am of myself for doing something probably quite normal on here.... I compiled my own image, and it worked. </p><p>If anyone isn&#039;t sure, there is the Image Builder, that allows you to put together your own configuration of packages, then there&#039;s Building from Source which creates an image for each device that matches the hardware spec. Thats the best way i can describe it with my level of knowledge.</p><p>If anyone is interested, i would recommend it, you&#039;ll need a working Linux OS of some sort, i used Ubuntu. Then just follow steps here: <a href="http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/01/openwrt-build-guide-start-to-finish/">http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/01/ope … to-finish/</a></p><p>Focus on one device at a time for first timers. Can get confusing with the number of files and folders you;re working with and the naming structure.</p><p>For those who aren&#039;t confident, let me know what you need and i&#039;ll be happy to compile something for you. Obviously you&#039;ll have to be happy to flash and risk your device. I make no guarantees.</p><p>Hope this little success helps push others in to diving in and improving their understanding and knowledge.</p><p>Now to try and compile something for the DIR615.</p><p>Peace and love.</p>									</div>
