					<p>First time poster here so dont judge me hard. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Few days ago i&#039;ve rented new flat and the problem is that ISP in this place uses PPPoE to connect users. Its not a problem to connect a single PC but i have 2 laptops and cell phone with wi-fi so i&#039;ve decided to use my old good access point which i&#039;ve been using for last 4 years. But the bad thing about it that it doesnt support PPPoE connections, so i&#039;ve decided to use OpenWrt project firmware.<br />I&#039;ve managed to install it using this tip:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hi</p><p>I managed to obtain an TEW-410APB+</p><p>here&#039;s what you got to do:</p><br /><p>reset to factory defaults</p><p>open <a href="http://192.168.1.250/fw-conf.asp">http://192.168.1.250/fw-conf.asp</a></p><p>select Disabled for &quot;DownGrade Header&quot; and &quot;Firmware Header&quot; and hit Apply</p><p>then you can upload a openwrt image via web-interface</p><p>It worked with openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx / size 1.548.288 bytes</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jx</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve used the latest OpenWrt whiterussian version 0.9<br />It installed well but when i try to change password using telnet connection or using web interface nothing happens. Looks like it hangs or something like that. Only unplug of power helps to return it to working state. I really need help with this i&#039;ve did basic search on forum and havent find anything about my access point. May be i should use Kamikaze instead of Whiterussian or i should use another version for example RC6+?</p><p>PS: I dont need any additional functionality, just need sharing of internet connection over wifi. Connection to ISP should be established through PPPoE.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wl04</strong> on 8 Sep 2009, 10:14)</p>
