It should be solid, if not, you&#039;re going to have to flash via TTL.&nbsp; If it is solid, proceed below:</p><p>1. Disconnect the WAN cable from the router and unplug the power cord<br />2. Completely disable the firewall on your pc and run a LAN cable from one of the LAN ports on the router to your PC<br />3. Plug the router power cable back in (NOT the WAN cable) and see if you&#039;re being assigned an IP that&#039;s not a link local IP (169.254.x.x)<br />4.If you&#039;re still being assigned a link local, manually assign your PC an IP of 192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0, and try to telnet in.</p><p><strong><em>If that fixes it, do not forget to re-enable your firewall PRIOR to plugging the WAN cable back in the router</em></strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 27 Jun 2015, 04:26)</p>
