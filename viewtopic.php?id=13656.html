					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I&#039;ve pulled a version of Kamikaze from SVN and built it successfully. However, I noticed that when I rebuild it a couple of days later that some of the packages used are newer versions and/or contain more patches. How do I deactivate this? I would like all my future rebuilds to use exactly the same versions/patches as with the first build I made...</p>									</div>

					<p>Nope. But doesn&#039;t it use the info from feeds.conf to fetch additional stuff? Or will I get exactly the same build if I were to do a<br />make clean<br />make<br />in 6 months from now, as long as I don&#039;t do any manual updating from svn myself?</p>									</div>
