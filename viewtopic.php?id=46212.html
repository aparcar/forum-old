					<p>I had in mind to build a router like this:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27354&amp;login=1">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ mp;login=1</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/grugq/portal#how-to-1">https://github.com/grugq/portal#how-to-1</a></p><p>Essentially, TOR in a box - everything goes through TOR.</p><p>To maximize the usefulness, I was thinking of making this a portable device, perhaps one of those TP-LINK battery-powered models.&nbsp; Ideally something that could run powered from an AC adapter but also run on battery if needed.</p><p>I&#039;m familiar with *-WRT and Tomato but more on the software side as a user...so I have a few questions if someone would be nice enough to answer:</p><p>- I can&#039;t find a battery-powered device that is sold in the US that has more than 4MB of Flash.&nbsp; (The Poray PRP-X5/X6 isn&#039;t sold here that I can find).&nbsp; The github link mentions a &quot;chipped router&quot; - for example, the &quot;stock&quot; MR11U has 4/32, while a &quot;chipped&quot; MR11U has 8/64.&nbsp; What is a &quot;chipped router&quot;?&nbsp; Is that just another way of saying &quot;opening it up and soldering on more flash and RAM&quot;?</p><p>- I&#039;m guessing my 551L LTE 4g USB modem is not going to work, given Verizon&#039;s &quot;vzaccess&quot; obsession but...thought I&#039;d ask if it&#039;s possible to dial and connect (even if only 3g) if I plug it into an OpenWRT box.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
