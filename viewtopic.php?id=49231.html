					<p>Hello again:</p><p>There&#039;s a post out there about an old bug in</p><p>/usr/lib/ddns/dynamic_dns_functions.sh</p><p>that messes with special characters being treated by the sed regex. It said that bug was fixed bt it called my attention to the script. I echoed out the variables it&#039;s supposed to use to update the ddns server and they were not set.</p><p>So from within ssh openwrt (wazzat? dropbear?):</p><p># to get my ip which matched what wan status and myipaddress.com said.<br />echo $( wget -O - <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org">http://checkip.dyndns.org</a> 2&gt;/dev/null)</p><p># Then to update the ddns server:<br /># wget -O - freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?NotMyAccessKeyWhichHasNoSpecialCharactersToWorryAboutAnyway</p><p>after that, freedns.afraid.org did show my new ip. So the ddns script isn&#039;t running; or it&#039;s broken; or it&#039;s failing before the update (It includes some other script - a more lengthy one.)</p><p>I need help figgering out how to troubleshoot that script, or pointers to set up my own so it runs every so often.</p><p>BTW. I set the DDNS source of ip to network and network to WAN. I think that&#039;s right. In any event, I had already tried interface and eth(0,1) How does that nomenclature work, anyway? eth(0,1) -&nbsp; I remember it was set up in VLAN bridging.</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>active8</strong> on 26 Feb 2014, 16:45)</p>
