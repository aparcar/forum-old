					<p>I doubt you will find a design/goals doc anywhere.&nbsp; You may check under the Developers Only forum.&nbsp; Check the sticky thread about wanting Web Interface Developers.&nbsp; I beleive it was some result of their thread which is now included with RC4.&nbsp; As this is the first release candidate with a web interface, and only released a week or so ago - a lot of people haven&#039;t made the jump to web interface.&nbsp; That post is probably your best bet as far as information goes.</p><p>As for unleashing it on clients (i.e. the average stupid user) I seriously doubt it is, or ever will be stupid friendly.&nbsp; At my office we are going to be pushing it out to some of our people here, but I have opened SSH on the wan port and refuse to let them configure anything.</p>									</div>
