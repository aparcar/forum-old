					<p>Hey guys I have some problems seting my devices I hope someone can help me with this!<br />So I have 2 Routers, Router 1 works just fine as DHCP server and should share my Internet conection with Router 2 which works fine if I use bridges, but I can not update OpenWRT or download OpenWRT packages this way. I also tried to set WAN of my Router 2 as DHCP client which didn‘t work. Can anybody tell me how to setup WAN on a fresh installation so that I can use opkg update and opkg install?</p><br /><p>Here is my setup:</p><p>Router 1: TL-MR3020<br />Firmware: DD-WRT<br />Connected to Internet via 3G Modem</p><p>Router 2: TL-WDR3600<br />Firmware: OpenWrt release build 12.09<br />Luci is installed<br />Connected to Internet via Router 1</p>									</div>

I have not used dd-wrt, but I think that also it uses 192.168.1.x as the default LAN address space...</p><p>The Openwrt router uses it too, so the inner router has thus 192.168.1.x both on the WAN side (dd-wrt&#039;s LAN) and its own LAN side. Routing logic gets screwed. </p><p>You might make sure that the routers use different LAN address space, so that the inner router get routing logic in order. Setup a fixed LAN address of 192.168.2.1 for the other router and thus 192.168.2.x as the LAN address space.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 17 Sep 2013, 22:16)</p>
