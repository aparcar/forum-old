					<p>I am working with a fairly recent update of the trunk (11415). When I load it up and run any uci show command that has unnamed sections in the file it spits out strange hex codes instead of logical numbers for example part of a uci show wireless output: <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>...<br />wireless.cfg03c014.ssid=ssid<br />wireless.cfg03c014.mode=ap<br />wireless.cfg03c014.device=wl0<br />...</p></blockquote></div><p>When I have worked with all previous versions of Kamikaze up through 7.09 it would have been cfg2 instead of cfg03c014.&nbsp; The cfg2 makes sense since this is the second config section in the wireless config file (the first being the wireless.wl0 section). </p><p>Is this a bug or is this a planned change? If it is a planned change is there any way to predict what that hex value will be?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>Right. I know when it happens. My question is: is it still supposed to be a 2 and the hex value showing up is a bug or did someone make a decision at some point that the hex value would be better than the integer?</p><p>The reason I need to know is I built a couple of shell scripts to manage a few things and I utilized the uci tools to manage the config files. These hex values are breaking all of my scripts though. I need to know if I can wait for a fix (or fix it myself) or if I should abandon the uci scripts and build my own configuration management tools.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here is a quick little wrapper script I wrote to provide the same get/set behaviour as the kamikaze 7.09 and earlier versions of the uci command. Hope this helps anyone else who had trouble with the hex values that crept into the uci&#039;s unnamed configuration sections since 7.09. Please let me know if there are any better/easier ways of accomplishing the same thing. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# A wrapper for the uci command
# This wrapper will have the same syntax as the uci command but it will only
#  implement get, set, show, and commit.
# The unnamed configuration sections went from being auto-named cfg1, cfg2, ...
#  to cfg&lt;hex&gt; ... so this wrapper attempts to work around this
#  by translating a number to the appropriate hex string.

. /etc/functions.sh

# Parse the command line
BCI_ACTION=$1
shift

# Deal with a commit command
if [ $BCI_ACTION == &quot;commit&quot; ]; then
        uci commit
        exit 0
fi

# Deal with a show command
if [ $BCI_ACTION == &quot;show&quot; ]; then
        uci show $*
        exit 0
fi

strtok &quot;$*&quot; BCI_FILE &quot;.&quot; BCI_SEC &quot;.&quot; BCI_ELEM &quot;=&quot; BCI_VALUE

# assume we either have a number or a cfg# syntax
# This sed command strips the input down to just the number at the end
BCI_SEC=$(echo $BCI_SEC | sed &#039;s/[a-zA-Z]*\([0-9]*\)/\1/&#039;)

# Load the appropriate config
config_load $BCI_FILE

# Start searching for the configuration section we are looking for
BCI_CFGNUM=1
for cfgsec in $CONFIG_SECTIONS; do
        if [ $BCI_CFGNUM -eq $BCI_SEC ]; then # Found it!

                else
                        uci get ${BCI_FILE}.${cfgsec}.${BCI_ELEM}
