					<p>I am trying to use applications compiled for another arm device on my linksys wrt1200 (also arm) without using openwrt imagebuilder and tools, which works for some apps. <br />but now I am trying to use lantern proxy on my router but I don&#039;t know how to compile it static. so it needs&quot; interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3&quot; which is not available in openwrt installation because it uses musl.<br />now my question is: if I set the compiler in openwrt image builder to glibc instead musl and use that image to install openwrt, what is the penalty for that?<br />does it work? is the musl the default and so glibc may be buggy? it is an space issue? or RAM space issue?</p><p>update:<br />the image created via imgaebuilder buy using glibc instead of musl is 32MB!!<br />so I cant install this , am I right?</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s a size issue mostly. Images produced with glibc are much larger as you&#039;ve discovered. They&#039;re really only suitable for systems with significant resources.</p>									</div>

This is known as cross-compilation. You use the OpenWrt buildroot environment (or the OpenWrt SDK). You&#039;ll need to do quite a lot of reading of the wiki and also view some sample package Makefiles to understand how to use it. This is a non-trivial exercise. </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>BTW the size issue is ram or space?</p></blockquote></div><p>Both.

					<p>thanks for the answer.<br />I changed back to musl&nbsp; (cause I got my lantern compiled , just by editing the makefile <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ) and deleted the bin and statge_dir and build_dir folders and remade the image for openwrt but the size of image is the exact size as the one produced by gcc !</p><p>is that not weird?<br />I have checked the diffconfig file and there gcc is remove correctly and I checked and the produced image is musl based but the size is the same as the glibc one.</p>									</div>
