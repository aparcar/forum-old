					<p>Hello,<br />I have been a regular visitor on these excellent forum discussions and have learned a lot.</p><p>I have finally moved from Netgear stick firmware to a pre-build OpeWrt firmware by &quot;arokh&quot; on my WNDR3700(1). Its working so much better than the stock.</p><p>I needed a help on configuring VLAN on my WNDR3700(1).</p><p>This is my scenario. I have a Netgear GS108T swtich serving as a backbone. I want to connect 2 ISPs connected to this 8 port switch. I want to achieve the setup below.</p><p>Switch GS108T - Port1-------Port2--------Port3------Port 4 -------+---- Port5----Port6----Port7----Port8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modem1 - WAN1(R1) - Modem2 - WAN2(R2) ---+--- LAN(R1) -(LANR2)--LAN--------&gt;</p><p>On the switch <br />VLAN10 is for Modem1 WAN <br />VLAN20 is for WNDR3700(1) LAN</p><p>Will be creating<br />VLAN30 for Modem2 WAN<br />VLAN40 is for WNDR3700(2) LAN </p><p>As you can see I want to attached Modem1 to port 1 on the GS108T switch and (WNDR3700)Router1 WAN port to switch port 2. On port 3 I want connect Modem2 and on port 4 connect (WNDR3700)Router2 WAN port. I want the rest of the ports as LAN ports in which the Router1 &amp; Router2 LAN ports will connected. Need to create additional VLANs later to manage 50+ mix devices (wired/wireless)</p><br /><br /><p>After a lot of invaluable help from members on broadbandreports Netgear forum I managed to successfully get the first modem and router to the switch. And its working beautifully.<br />Some history here. <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25463335-GS108Tv2-Configure-VLANs">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r254633 … gure-VLANs</a></p><p>Port1-------Port2-----Port3----Port 4 --+--- Port5----Port6----Port7----Port8<br />Modem1 - WAN(R1) - LAN(R1) - LAN ----+--- LAN --------------------------&gt;</p><p>I was able to achieve this by doing this on the Netgear GS108T switch..</p><p>vlan 10 is WAN(1)<br />vlan 1 is LAN</p><p>Switch port: vlanID, pvid<br />1-2: 10U, 10<br />3-8: 1U, 1</p><p>Nothing has been done on the WNDR3700(1) to achieve this.</p><p>Now I need to move one step ahead to get the second ISP Modem2 and WNDR3700(2) on the switch. But to do this I need to create 2 VLANs on the WNDR3700(1) first so that it will accept only VLAN10 data on its WAN port from Modem1 and VLAN20 data for it&#039;s LAN.</p><p>Please keep in mind that I do not want to change any ports on the router. I just want to let them function the way they are... that is 1 WAN port and 4 LAN ports need to function like they do in stock firmware. I had to move to OpenWrt as Netgear stock firmware does not support VLAN.</p><p>I am more comfortable with Luci GUI but if needed I can try to edit the files by connecting through ssh.</p><p>WNDR3700 internal details are here <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/speak/slideshow/25467844?c=1626307&amp;ret=L2ZvcnVtL3IyNTQ2MzMzNS1HUzEwOFR2Mi1Db25maWd1cmUtVkxBTnM%3D">http://www.dslreports.com/speak/slidesh … VkxBTnM%3D</a></p><br /><p>So my main question is</p><p>What is the configuration needed to achieve my setup on WNDR3700(1) ??????</p><p>I am looking for VLAN10 data from switch on router WAN port and VLAN20 data from switch on router LAN ports</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>banstro</strong> on 12 Feb 2011, 19:48)</p>

					<p>Make sure your switch leaves the vlan tags intact, so the port where the WNDR3700 is is set to always tagged. </p><p>Also the switch doesn&#039;t provide IPs, your modem should probably <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>KM again thanks for helping me out. Appreciate it.</p><p>Correct me if I am wrong.. In VLAN membership I need to put a &quot;T&quot; tag on the port where the WNDR3700 WAN port is correct?

					<p>You only need to set the port tagged where you need more than one vlan. In your case, its 2. Leave 1 as untagged, as I doubt that your modem can receive vlan tagged frames.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok a reboot helped. Also the wifi network in OpenWRT Luci switched from LAN to unspecified/create.. hence I was not able to acquire an IP on the wireless side. LAN port worked fine.<br />I have kept port 3 &quot;T&quot; tagged for VLAN20 on the switch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>banstro</strong> on 13 Feb 2011, 06:46)</p>
