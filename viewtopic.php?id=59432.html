Can I flash via the web interface for ease? Which one of these do I choose? openwrt-atheros-combined.squashfs.img?<br />Also sorry for the really noob question, how do I check from SSH/web UI if I have enough space? Is there something I could copy into this post that could tell me if I have enough space?</p>									</div>
