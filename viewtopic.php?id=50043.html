					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I cannot for the life of me solve this - I&#039;ve spent a couple of hours at least trying a myriad of things. I have a VPN pptp tunnel which is functioning - from the shell I can ping my VPN host, and also if I traceroute out onto the Internet, it goes out through my VPN.</p><p>However, when connected over WIFI, I cannot get OpenWrt to route all traffic over the pptp tunnel.</p><p>My interfaces page looks like this: </p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/51msjdzm3y9l7ti/Screenshot%202014-04-13%2019.00.36.png">https://www.dropbox.com/s/51msjdzm3y9l7 â€¦ .00.36.png</a></p><p>What do I need to do to make this thing work?</p><p>Thanks so much, m.</p>									</div>

					<p>In my experience, the hard part is getting a stable tunnel. I had better luck with l2tp than pptp. But once you have the tunnel, it&#039;s a matter of routing your traffic through it. You basically need two routes: A default route to send all traffic into the tunnel, and a route that sends the tunnel itself to your vpn server via your gateway. I believe that some of this is done for you with the pptp configuration on openwrt. For l2tp, I use:</p><p>/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/addroute</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

. /etc/functions.sh
. /lib/network/config.sh

GW=&quot;$(uci_get_state network wan gateway)&quot;
WAN=&quot;$(uci_get_state network wan ifname)&quot;

route add $PPP_REMOTE gw $GW dev $WAN
route del $PPP_REMOTE dev $PPP_IFACE</code></pre></div><p>and /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/delroute</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

route del $PPP_REMOTE</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the tip - unfortunately soon after I posted this, I accidentally set a DROP rule on all zones and now I&#039;m permanently locked out of the box... Oops. If I ever manage to get it back up I&#039;ll give your suggestion a try - thanks again.</p><p>m.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>plasticassius wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>In my experience, the hard part is getting a stable tunnel.
