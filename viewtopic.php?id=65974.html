					<p>Judging from the value &quot;Disabled&quot; in row ptm0.1, column VlanMuxId, I would guess you do not need to add a VLAN tag. But really just try DHCP and report failure/success back and we can take it from there... BTW what kind of modem are you using?</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
