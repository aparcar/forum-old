					<p>Hi:</p><p>I have been looking for a opensource project to run a HotSpot inside a small business (cafe, restaurant, etc). Usually this small business use a basic POS software and the customer receive a voucher or invoice.<br />The best situation is that the customer receive the wifi connection parameters (USER+PASSWORD+TIME_CONNECTION) printed in this invoice. Therefore, the POS and the Hotspot must share information. The USER+PASSWORD+TIME_CONNECTION must be use by the POS software.</p><p>I think this interaction could be as follows:</p><p>1) The OpenWrt HotSpot software&nbsp; generate each day the valid users for this day.&nbsp; The HotSpot create the new users list each day at 06:00 and store them in the TXT file. For example 1000 users with 10 minutes connection and 1000 users with 20 minutes connection. <br />2) When a customer buy something, the POS read the TXT file and assign a USER+PASSWORD+TIME_CONNECTION. The time_connection is assigned by the POS soft and depends on the amount of the bill.<br />If the customer bought less than a certain amount, is assigned the minimum connection_time, otherwise it is assigned the maximum time. When each users tries to connect, is immediately recognized as a valid user. </p><p>3) If the user initiates his wifi connection, the OpenWrt enables this connection only for specific time, defined in the time_connection field. Each user can connect only for this &quot;time_connection&quot; field, after this time, the user is disconnected from the HotSpot.&nbsp; If the user need more time, must buy again, and receive a new user+password+time_connection.</p><p>4) Each time a customer buy something, he receive a POS invoice. The POS software read from the TXT file&nbsp; a specific user_name; user_password; time_connection and print it in the Invoice.</p><p>With this operation logic, there are important benefits:<br />1) The Hotspot users parameters can be integrated with almost any POS software using this TXT file<br />2) The HotSpot users is regenerated each day, the POS operators can&#039;t access this file.<br />3) No need to have preprinted tickets, in the POS invoice are&nbsp; printed the parameters to connect.</p><p>Someone think a better way to integrate POS and Hotspot?<br />Someone knows about a project with similar functionality? (the connection parameters printed in the invoice is a must)</p><p>Thanks<br />Ricardo Strauch</p>									</div>
