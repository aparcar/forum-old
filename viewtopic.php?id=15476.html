					<p>An ASUS WL500g running kamikaze 7.09-bcrm-2.4 keeps rebooting itself under heavy traffic. &quot;Heavy&quot; here refers to the available upstream bandwidth, not to the traffic itself. That is: uploading (TCP) at maximum speed on a 50 KBps line will cause the router to keep rebooting, although 50 KBps in itself is really nothing. Reducing the upload speed by 10% makes the router much more stable, but doesn&#039;t completely eliminate the reboots. On the other hand, downloading at the full speed of 1 MBps doesn&#039;t cause any problems at all. </p><p>Logging is on (loglevel info), but gives no clues. I have tried watchdog in nvram as 0, 50000 (ten times the default) and unset, but none of this made any difference.&nbsp; </p><p>Reasonably, the reboots are caused by some kind of network congestion control and not by hardware overload. I haven&#039;t been able to find anything on this subject though, nor anyone else complaining about it before. </p><p>The router&#039;s WAN interface is connected to a modem and gets a public IP address from it. It is possible that the modem keeps resetting the connection, but I don&#039;t see how that could cause the router to reboot. </p><p>Any ideas anyone? </p><p>Z</p>									</div>

					<p>Zenon, I&#039;m experiencing the same problem but don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because of the same reason. It&#039;s always after approx. 2 days of uptime.<br />Did you discover anything else?</p><p>Thanks,<br />pedrofaustino</p><p>----<br />ASUS WL-500GP running kamikaze 7.09-bcrm-2.4</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pedrofaustino</strong> on 27 Apr 2008, 23:28)</p>

					<p>My box can stay up for weeks if I don&#039;t push the upload bandwidth limit, and will reboot within minutes if I do. So the cause seems to be different, but without any logs there&#039;s no telling for sure. And no, I haven&#039;t come any closer to understanding the problem, let alone solving it. </p><p>Z</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m doing the opposite, internet radio and p2p is always on at least on one computer.</p><p>Yesterday I&#039;ve just build OpenWRT from trunk and after 12 hours of uptime the result is a much more stable wifi connection (no more this problem <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1222)">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1222)</a>.
