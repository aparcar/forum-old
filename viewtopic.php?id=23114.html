					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like help building an OpenWrt /Noauth setup for a simple captive website.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really have any hardware today that will work well, so I would like to build a low cost/footprint system from scratch, thats a good setup.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I am a basic Linux user and some of the steps are really beyond my skill or interest to figure out.&nbsp; Anyone interested in helping me put one together?</p>									</div>

					<p>Where are you?&nbsp; Here&#039;s a simple, cheap solution if you are in North America.<br />1. Buy a WL-520gU from Newegg for $45US.<br />2. Flash it with trunk: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ uashfs.trx</a> Use the Asus software on the router&#039;s CD after putting the router into &quot;restore&quot; mode by holding down the reset button while powering on (you can release after 2 seconds)<br />3. Telnet into 192.168.1.1 (download and use putty if you don&#039;t have a telnet program); change your password with passwd.&nbsp; Change the router ip with &quot;vi /etc/config/network&quot; if you don&#039;t like 192.168.1.1 (I use 192.168.1.62--and add your gateway and dns, perhaps &quot;option gateway 192.168.1.1&quot; and &quot;option dns 192.168.1.1&quot; to give web access)<br />4.&nbsp; Create your first web page with echo &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, World from wl62&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; &gt; /www/hello.htm Enable it with chmod 755 /www/hello.htm<br />5.&nbsp; Reboot<br />6.&nbsp; Check out your web page at <a href="http://192.168.1.1/hello.htm">http://192.168.1.1/hello.htm</a><br />7.&nbsp; Sign back in to make changes using ssh with putty or other ssh client.</p><p>Edit: fixed incorrect path to config file in step 3.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 14 Jan 2010, 20:23)</p>

					<p>Note that the WL-520gU is towards the bottom in features by current standards.&nbsp; No wireless N, only 4 megabytes of flash, and only 16 of SDRam.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is a pretty powerful device with some earlier problems fixed--new devices run at 240mHz rather than the older 200, and openWrt now supports USB 2--you might find posts that say it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; Wireless is fixed for 2.6 kernel (sort of) in Kamikaze trunk (with fewer features, so far, compared to 2.4 kernel).</p><p>One of the router&#039;s best features is that it is dead easy to flash, and hard to brick.&nbsp; To flash, as noted above, use the Asus &quot;recovery&quot; software that comes with the router (in Windows--in Linux use a tftp server), press the reset button while plugging in power, release after two seconds.&nbsp; The power led will flash and you are in upgrade mode and can flash the device.</p><p>To continue:</p><p>Want to move masses of web page files from another PC?</p><p>18. opkg update, then opkg install openssh-sftp-server, reboot<br />19.

					<p>I don&#039;t think you can have killed it.&nbsp; I have flashed three of them dozens of times trying out different configurations.&nbsp; You need to have it plugged into a port other than the WAN port.&nbsp; Are you getting the blinking power light when you try to flash?</p><p>Since you edited a &quot;network&quot; file in a directory where openWrt doesn&#039;t look for it, I wouldn&#039;t have thought that the original IP would have changed.&nbsp; You have tried 192.168.1.1?&nbsp; What does your whole configuration look like?&nbsp; Broadband incoming to what to what ... ?&nbsp; You&#039;re sure you don&#039;t have another router which might have that same address?&nbsp; What happens if you are plugged into the router (and nothing else) and from a command prompt you do &quot;ping 192.168.1.1&quot;?</p><p>What is the ip address of your broadband connection--cable modem or dsl modem or what?</p>									</div>

					<p>yeah it just didnt seem right and I could see wifi service was running still as well.&nbsp; I have been playing with it and found that after I cleared the wireless connection settings, it connected through the asus utility to allow me to flash again.&nbsp; I will go back through the steps to set it up.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok,&nbsp; I have flashed it a couple of times and gone through the steps and found that the problem starts when the router is rebooted.&nbsp; The first time I can set it up through telnet and access the system, but after I type reboot,&nbsp; the system never gives a dhcp address successfully or allows connection though SSH, telnet or any choice in putty. The website stops working&nbsp; and it works before the reboot.&nbsp; </p><p> This appears true whether I edit the Network file or not.&nbsp; The only other thing i am changing is turning wireless on by commenting out the Wireless disabled line in the wireless file.&nbsp; The wifi does appear,&nbsp; but connection hangs during the IP part.&nbsp; OK I found that if I dont reboot and I run the command wifi start,&nbsp; it does know the system down (cant ssh, web site down, doesnt ping) and I have to reflash.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>any thoughts on what to check on DCHP or the reboot scenario?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndrewW</strong> on 17 Jan 2010, 00:43)</p>

					<p>When you telnet in the first time, are you using the passwd command to change the password?&nbsp; That is necessary to enable the ssh.&nbsp; </p><p>How about setting up a static ip--something appropriate for the ip range which your broadband connection.&nbsp; I&#039;ll suppose it is 198.162.1.1/254.&nbsp; If so, edit network config with &quot;vi /etc/config/network&quot;. change the default openWrt ip address from 198.162.1.1 to 198.162.1.62, add &quot;option gateway 198.162.1.1&quot; and &quot;option dns 198.162.1.1&quot; (if those are right for your broadband ip), and reboot--don&#039;t set up the wireless.&nbsp; See if everything looks ok.</p><p>By the way, wireless with the WL-520gU (or any broadcom 43xx router) works best with a Linux 2.4 kernel--but USB works best with a Linux 2.6 kernal.&nbsp; Your original post didn&#039;t say anything about providing or using wireless, so my recommendations considered that you wouldn&#039;t enable it.&nbsp; If you need to add wireless to your network, you might want to dedicate a router to that, and a different one to serving the web pages (wired in).</p>									</div>
