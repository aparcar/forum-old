					<p>Hi All, I must be using the wrong search terms because my research is turning up null. Anyway, I have created a separate wireless lans/ssids. What I want to do is attached one of the ssid to a separate DNS (openDNS servers to be exact). I believe I have to create a virtual network interface, but I&#039;m not sure on the exact set up. Any how tos out there someone can point me to?</p><p>In the end, I want to attach my children&#039;s devices to the SSID attached to the vlan using OpenDNS and other devices use the SSID using the DNS servers from my ISP.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Didjit</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All, I&#039;m also interesting in this topic. Having TL-WR1043ND with latest stable 10.03.1 i was able to create two SSID (*NORMAL* and *NORMAL*-KID) attached to two different vlans (LAN [192.168.1.0] and SAFELAN [192.168.2.0] ). But i&#039;m a bit confused in how to proper assign different DNS (OpenDNS) for the second vlan. I&#039;m a not a console geek and did everything via luci. So, I was able to do it by assigning a custom DNS command (6,208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220), but in this case DHCP assigning these DNS directly to the clients and client can easily override them manually (kids are growing fast <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />). Also i have a custom media server that is attached to first lan and i&#039;m trying to make it visible to both lans. But once DNS is changed for second lan the media server can not be resolved. So, any help? Thanks.</p>									</div>
