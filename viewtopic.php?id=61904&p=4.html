					<p>Those are good questions, and I don&#039;t know the answers.</p><p>Is the primary partition EXT4?

					<p>PSA: I&#039;ve found that if you&#039;re running the kaloz build and try to upgrade to trunk or davidc502&#039;s snapshots, using the .img files, results instability that will soft-brick your wrt1900acs. </p><p>The router will not get a valid IP, and you cannot ssh into it. If you&#039;re lucky to have a working firmware in the backup partition, you can do the 3 on/off trick to revert back to that firmware. </p><p>I&#039;ve also found that upgrading from kaloz build to trunk/davidc502 using the sysupgrade.tar works but with some artifacts due to some incompatibilities.</p><p>The only safe way from going from kaloz -&gt; trunk/davidc502, is to first flash the router with the factory image, then the openwrt image you need.</p>									</div>

However****&nbsp; There is a known issue of running out of ram during file transfers. Unless you know how to set up a swap partition, instead of the system using RAM, it might not have much use.</p><p>Yes, LuCi is included... just point your browser to 192.168.1.1</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>									</div>
