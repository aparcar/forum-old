					<p>I am trying to configure a vlan interface on the wan port of my router, not connected with the internal switch. On this particular model, the wan port is stand-alone and not part of the switch. As per the documentation, I have added the following to /etc/config/network (eth1 is the wan interface):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config device &#039;eth1.20&#039;
       option type &#039;8021q&#039;
       option name &#039;eth1.20&#039;
       option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
       option vid &#039;20&#039;</code></pre></div><p>This doesn&#039;t seem to do anything. After rebooting the router, the vlan interface doesn&#039;t exist:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# ifconfig eth1.20 up
ifconfig: SIOCGIFFLAGS: No such device</code></pre></div><p>Is there another way to create a vlan on one of the ports? Am I doing it wrong?</p><p>The specs are:<br />TP-Link TL-WR841N v.11.1<br />Openwrt DESIGNATED DRIVER (Bleeding Edge, 49928)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xj25vm</strong> on 10 Oct 2016, 11:59)</p>

					<p>I have tried adding the device in an interface config - and that doesn&#039;t work either. If I only add eth1.20 in an interface config, but I *don&#039;t* add the device section - it does create the eth1.20 device automatically - but as far as I can tell, it is not a vlan device.</p><p>Can anyone confirm that the &quot;device&quot; stanza still works on current versions of OpenWRT - after the move has been made away from &quot;vconfig&quot; to using the iproute2 command for setting up vlan&#039;s?</p><p>Edit: Hmm - the plot is thickening. I can create the vlan interface on the command line:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /sbin/ip link add link eth1 name eth1.20 type vlan id 20</code></pre></div><p>Then I can bring it up with ifconfig and it shows in the list of interfaces:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ifconfig eth1.20 up</code></pre></div><p>But if I try ifup, it doesn&#039;t detect it exists:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ifup eth1.20
Interface eth1.20 not found</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xj25vm</strong> on 3 Oct 2016, 15:09)</p>

					<p>OK, I&nbsp; can confirm that in a current snapshot, the following doesn&#039;t work:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config device &#039;eth1.20&#039;
       option type &#039;8021q&#039;
       option name &#039;eth1.20&#039;
       option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
       option vid &#039;20&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Actually, after reboot, it leaves my router in an unknown state and I can&#039;t reconnect to it. I have to reset it completely to get back in.</p><p>However, just adding the eth1.20 to any interface section - without defining it separately as a device - seems to automatically create the vlan interface. For example, turning the wan interface into a bridge:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;
        option type &#039;bridge&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth1.20&#039;
        option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</code></pre></div><p>... and now checking it is really a vlan interface (after installing the package ip-full, as the ip command included in BusyBox is more limited):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip -d link show eth1.20
7: eth1.20@eth1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master br-wan state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether c4:e9:84:97:03:7d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff promiscuity 1 
    vlan protocol 802.1Q id 20 &lt;REORDER_HDR&gt; 
    bridge_slave state forwarding priority 32 cost 19 hairpin off guard off root_block off fastleave off learning on flood on addrgenmode eui64 </code></pre></div><p>Maybe the Wiki needs updating to remove the instructions regarding creating a vlan device separately - unless I&#039;ve missed something above?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xj25vm</strong> on 12 Jul 2017, 20:22)</p>

It&#039;s just that I needed to use the physical wan port of the router in my config - with a vlan attached to it.</p><p>On the other hand, I&#039;m not sure I understand what you are trying to achieve. If you are going to create a vlan on your actual wan port - is there a vlan switch at the provider end, to process all those vlan packets they are going to receive from your end?</p>									</div>
