					<p>Hi<br />just looking for a quick sanity check before a plunge headlong in to the unkown.</p><p>I live upstairs, where my modem &amp; wireless router is, but work down stairs where my wifi doesn&#039;t reach due to the&nbsp; 6&quot;&nbsp; re-enforced concrete floor bwteen them.</p><p>so i figure a &#039;repeater&#039; of some sort beyond the perimeter of the house will solve the problem.</p><p>i can get one for $130AUD, but where&#039;s the fun in that. I have a spare WRT54G, which i bought in hope that one day i could shove some form of linux on it and &#039;play&#039;.</p><p>Can I use just 1 device as the &#039;repeater&#039;...i.e. it picks up the signal from upstairs and (i guess) routes packets back to same port, re transmitting them to downstairs. I&#039;m not sure if either a) the radio circuitry can do this, or b) the network routing logic can be expressed for this.</p><p>Or alternatively, if i add a 2nd wrt54g, or perhaps a mac mini with linux on it, or ...&lt;insert gadget here&gt; the outcome can be achieved?</p><p>Thanks for any tips</p><p>Glenn</p>									</div>
