					<p>Hi,<br />I am trying to JTAG MT7620A router which has 8 pin out of the board. The pins are- TRST, TCK, GND, TMS, TDI, VCC, TDO, RST. My JTAG device is FTDI2332 based, 20 pin, ARM-USB-OCD from Olimex. The router&#039;s onboard Vcc pin (jtag) is 3.3v when JTAG debugger Vcc is 5v. Unlike the 20 pin JTAG configuration, there is no Vcc (ref) pin onboard. Should I connect board&#039;s Vcc to the JTAG device&#039;s Vref pin (pin 2)?</p><p>Naturally, I couldn&#039;t find any cfg file for this particular SoC. Is there any available openocd cfg file for MT7620A? Any reference or hints on how to carry on? Any suggestion or precaution from your experience?</p><p>P.S. I don&#039;t wanna burn/damage anything, so I&#039;m not going through trial-and-error. Your suggestions are very important to me.</p>									</div>

Thanks for sharing your experience. I read the general jtag guidelines from openwrt wiki and from several articles I found online through google. It seems that the relatively well documented jtag device used for openwrt uses parallel port for connection. But I have only Segger J-link and FT2332 based Olimex arm-usb-ocd in my hand. So, it will be convenient to use openocd instead. FYI, my router has MIPS 24Kc based MT7620A SoC. </p><p>I connected the olimex jtag to the router and used all the pins. I connected Vcc from the board to the Vcc(ref) pin of jtag, pin 1. Without any configuration, when I connected it to the computer, the router reset and remain halt (or infinite reset loop, not sure), and disconnecting the jtag device made the router start again. On the other hand connecting the j-link to the router showed erratic behavior on the router side (pics @ <a href="http://imgur.com/a/oaz7E),">http://imgur.com/a/oaz7E),</a> nor did jlink software recognize the CPU. So, I am going to stick to olimex jtag as long as I can&#039;t figure out the issue with jlink.</p><p>I should confess that my hardware debugging experience is limited within ARM series only, and I have little knowledge on MIPS. About openocd - I found MIPS32 files and sample of MIPS 4k debug cfg files. However, I am confused if the default MIPS32 files are going to support MIPS 24Kc. I&#039;m trying to figure that out. A quick search through programming guide for MT7620A and the data sheet didn&#039;t help much either. The open resource on EJTAG is so little that it seems, unlike ARM, hardware debugging is optional for MIPS. </p><p>I will be glad to share my whole experience in debugging this router once I succeed. But it seems a long journey (or no journey) for me. Any suggestion and help is appreciated. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>According to <a href="http://www.anz.ru/files/mediatek/MT7620_Datasheet.pdf">this</a> datasheet, your board has an nTRST pin so your probe must keep the processor out of the reset state as explained in my earlier comment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geryhun</strong> on 12 Dec 2014, 20:59)</p>

I just tested the RST pins, and it&#039;s actually SRST pin which is holding the system into reset mode. Thanks for mentioning the data sheet, another interesting point that I forgot to mention is- the eJTAG pins are muxed with EPHY_LED pins in this SoC. There is a register (SYSCFG0: System Configuration Register 0) which needs to be configured to change from phy led to jtag mode. I&#039;m not sure at where and how I need to change this register&#039;s value. </p><p>Interestingly, while searching about ejtag, I came across a debug project <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ejtagproxy">ejtagproxy</a> which mentions Olimex arm-usb-ocd as once of the compatible JTAG debugger. On the other hand <a href="https://www.segger.com/jlink_supported_devices.html"> Segger j-link </a> debugger lists PIC32, which comes with eJTAG v2.6 support. So, that should work with this SoC as well. Only things missing are the config files for the target board in openocd and trial-and-error to make it work.</p><p>I am experimenting on a chinese made router, model no. oye-0001 from oyewifi.com.

Without JTAG access you are not likely be able to control the CPU at all, except if you have serial access or there are some hardware switches (jumpers, DIP switches etc) on the board. Or, the simplest case, the board has some software flashed by default which can be used to set the register&#039;s value. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Only things missing are the config files for the target board in openocd and trial-and-error to make it work.</p></blockquote></div><p>Take a look at this thread:</p><p><a href="http://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2012-December/141384.html">http://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2 … 41384.html</a></p><p>This config is for an Atheros AR71XX SoC but it has the same MIPS CPU model as your device:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ar71xx.cfg:
