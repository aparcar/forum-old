					<p>Hi All</p><p>Please I need somebody can say me how can I fix the next issue.</p><p>I am using OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 in TP-Link TL-MR3220 v2. Now I am testing the virtual SSID because I wanted to use wondershaper. The reason: limited data in LTE modem plan, I am not living in city so part of family use WIFI to watch Youtube in HD... now with virtual ssid and wondershaper i can limit the speed and force the quality video to standard for the virtual ssid.This works excellent</p><p>The issue happen when I reboot the router (from luci o using ssh) because the service wshaper fail when start in boot. I think it is because the wlan0-1 (virtual wifi) is not just active when start. I used a simple line in rc.local to fix this: this line (sleep 10 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/wshaper start &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/wshaper restart)&amp;<br />However after this, in reboot sometimes the router access is not working, the dhcp or dnsmasq I think is not working because my devices (phone, laptop, etc) says: obtaining ip... Luckily the laptop can use access ssh to router using 192.168.1.1, then I do /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart and again work normally, all devices get IP address<br />Sometimes only Unplugging and plugging again the boot and proccess works without problems</p><p>Sorry if I am wrong, I am only a basic user of linu. I added the next lines to rc.local to resolve this:</p><p>(/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart)&amp;<br />(sleep 10 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/wshaper start &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/wshaper restart)&amp;</p><p><strong>so, Where is the problem using a virtual ssid and wondershaper ????</strong></p><p>my config used to use virtual ssid:</p><p>/etc/config/network</p><p>config interface &#039;vwifi&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.2.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</p><p>cat /etc/config/dhcp</p><p>config dhcp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option start &#039;100&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option leasetime &#039;12h&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;vwifi&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option limit &#039;10&#039;</p><p>/etc/config/wireless</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;SSID&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;vwifi&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;psk-mixed&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;+X+mEtN56qVF98k&#039;</p><p>/etc/config/firewall</p><p>config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option forward &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;vwifi&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;vwifi&#039;</p><p>config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;vwifi&#039;</p><p>Thanks,Im sorry my english</p>									</div>

					<p>Make vwifi a bridge and set force_link on it.&nbsp; This will make it always exist even if the wifi is down.&nbsp; Run wshaper on br-vwifi, not wlan0-1.</p><p>wshaper is obsolete you should look at sqm instead.</p>									</div>

Did you get help and support back the? I ask, because I am willing to help evaluating sqm-scripts again for your use-case. It is clear that sqm-scripts will not work for everybody as the goal is a basically no toggles traffic shaper that mostly does either the right thing or at least no harm; but for users requiring, say prioritization on a IP basis sqm-scripts simply is the wrong tool. But latency reduction per se is in sqm-script&#039;s scope and it would be interesting to see whether we can get this going for your use case. Just let me know if you are interested in re-vsitiong sqm-scripts, if not that obviously is also fine...</p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi moeller0,</p><p>I think I will not back to test again the sqm script, simply because now the connection of internet is different and because is a bit complex to implement again, so Im sorry for this.<br />However I can say what was the particular issue and why I never thought again use in my router.</p><p>I had a very slow connection using 3g usb modem download speed of 1Mbps. Basically I used to surf in internet, watch low quality video in Youtube and watch satellite TV with IKS account to desencrypt channel, obviously. In this point IKS account need only a stable connection, the speed was not important for this. The issue happened what I tried to use two or more task in the same time, I am agree off course the bandwidth of internet is small, but I needed the IKS account used by my satellital be the first priority because using all in same time many times the IKS account lost or not received the packets of server IKS, so I couldn&#039;t watched TV.</p><p>Then, I found the sqm-script, but to use I needed more flash memory. I had to downgrade from Chaos Calmer 15.05 to Barrier Breaker 14.07 why this version was the only allow me install necessary *.ipk to use extroot and so can use external storage usb to install 3g *ipk and sqm *ipk</p><p>All implementation work ok, but sometime the extroot was failing, while use the router or simply en boot process. in this situation I think this config will not work OK. This was one reason because I never used again.<br />Respect to the how worked the sqm-scripts I can says It worked worst than if you doesnt use the script xD. The IKS connection was very very more bad, I think extremelly bad respect to the theorical idea to manage better slow connection. My IKS in decoder several simply lost connections. The sqm scripts doesnt have option to add a first priority IP to avoid lost package necessary because They arrived every five seconds and whenuse sqm-script while execute two or more task (surf, phone apps, messages, whatsapp, videos youtube) the IKS accounts simply doesnt works. it need only 80kps to work. For this reason I said the sqm-script had High latency.<br />I tested it in my basic router TP-Link TL-MR3220 v2.<br />Now Fortunately I have a LTE connection of 20Mbps max, so the problem is limited data plan, and using wondershaper I can set a slow speed to avoid HD video in phones/devices in my family <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />. It is works great more virtual SSID</p><p>i would like learn to create a custom image with 4g *ipk and wondershaper *ipk, but I think is complex D: </p><p>it was all</p>									</div>
