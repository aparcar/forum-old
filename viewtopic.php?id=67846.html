					<p>Would it be possible to have HAProxy and OpenWrt configured in such a way that access to my servers is exactly the same form within my LAN as from the internet?</p><p>Currently HAProxy (on my OpenWrt router) is listening on non-standard ports (xxx80 and xx443) and I have port forwarding from WAN port 80 and 443 respectively to these ports. That works fine when I access my servers from the WAN (internet) but not from LAN. Also, I couldn&#039;t get HAProxy on my router to work when I binded it to ports 80 and 443 with port forwarding WAN:80-&gt;router ip:80. I changed the port on which uhhtpd is listening from 80 to somethiing else, so that should be out of the way.</p><p>Is it possible to have HAProxy listening on ports 80 and 443 and access HAProxy both from WAN and LAN? And if yes, what do I need to do to accomplish this?</p>									</div>
