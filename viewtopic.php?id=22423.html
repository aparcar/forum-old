					<p>hello everyone,<br />I am working on openwrt&nbsp; and thinking to use the self healing concept with it. but I don&#039;t know that whether openwrt supports self healing or not. if it does support than what are the packages which carry out self healing concept?<br />And if it does not have any package for self healing than can we introduce some kind of packages which will help on this and where to begin for this.<br />plz do think on it and help me with this.</p><br /><p>thanks.</p>									</div>
