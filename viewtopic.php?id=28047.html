					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have openwrt backtrack 10.03.1rc4 working in nanostation M2 but it seems the wireless drivers isn´t too stable so I would like to restore airos in the device by now</p><p>I have readed docs un ubiquiti website and the openwrt wiki:<br /><a href="http://www.ubnt.com/wiki/Firmware_Recovery">http://www.ubnt.com/wiki/Firmware_Recovery</a></p><p>I can follow all steps but when the device boots in recovery mode I can´t ping 192.168.1.20. I doesn´t asnwer icmp ping but nmap says 192.168.1.20 is alive and shows the port 69/udp as open/filtered.</p><p>Then I try to upload the airos firmware by tftp and the devide gets it but I always get &quot;Firmware check failed&quot;. I have double checked md5sum of firmware files I downloaded from ubiquiti web and also tried with three differents airos versions, always with the same error. I have also tried with different tftp clients (tftp and atftp) and tried different ethernet cables. I even tried to do it using windows and I keep getting the same error.</p><p>It seems to me that the devide is not properly booting in recovery mode, the lights behave the way that is explained in the docs, tftp server is open and it gets the firmware file but it doesn´t answer to icmp ping (docs say it should) and I always get the &quot;firmware check failed&quot; error.</p><p>¿anyone knows what is going on? ¿is there any other way to restore airos? ¿maybe I should totally uninstall openwrt from flash? I am scared of doing this in case I brick the&nbsp; device and I have no openwrt or airos. </p><p>many thanks for any help in this topic.</p><p>p.d. I also tried to downgrade to backtrack rc1 with no luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think maybe the problem is openwrt doesn´t leave enough free space in the flash and that is the reason why I can´t upload the full airos image and I get the &quot;firmware check&quot; error. but looking at the output of the df command it seems it has enough space ¿or am I wrong?</p><p>the airos image that I am uploading by tftp is 3.0M and this the df output in the device:</p><p> </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root                 2.1M      2.1M         0 100% /rom
tmpfs                    14.4M     76.0K     14.3M   1% /tmp

mini_fo:/overlay          2.1M      2.1M         0 100% /</code></pre></div><p>If the low free space is the reason maybe deleting openwrt before trying to restore airos could work so I have readed this:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/uninstall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/uninstall</a></p><p>there says I can use mtd to erase the flash but here I readed I can´t flash the ubiquiti airos .bin file using mtd:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=6938">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=6938</a></p><p>so I think the only option would be to run &quot;mtd -e linux&quot; or &quot;mtd erase linux&quot;, when mtd finishes the device would have nothing in the flash (it wouldn´t boot) and then maybe the firmware restore procedure should work.<br />¿can anyone confirm if this is possible or am I totally wrong?</p><p>many thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>esplinter</strong> on 9 Jan 2011, 02:47)</p>

					<p>The firmware recovery feature still appears to be available after installing OpenWrt. I just upgraded my OpenWrt using it. Sending the AirOS image instead of OpenWrt should work.</p><p>Put yourself on the 192.168.1.0/24 network<br />Ping 192.168.1.20<br />Reboot ubiquiti while holding down reset<br />When 192.168.1.20 begins responding:<br />&gt; tftp 192.168.1.20<br />&gt; bin<br />&gt; put &lt;software_image&gt;.bin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bulldozer2003</strong> on 17 Feb 2011, 00:44)</p>
