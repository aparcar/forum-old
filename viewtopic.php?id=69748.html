					<p>Hello,</p><p>have you tried to change the antennas? TP-Link offers some nice indoor antennas for the 1043nd. They are called &quot;TL-ANT2408CL&quot; Maybe you will get a better wifi connection.</p><br /><p>Christoph</p>									</div>

					<p>hello,</p><p> I don&#039;t think a 5Ghz device will help, because the eduram wifi uses 2.4 Ghz and for the lan he uses cables. So the only ways to improve the wifi 2.4 Ghz connection is 1) with better antennas or 2) with a device with very good 2.4 Ghz WiFi performance. Correct me, if I&#039;m wrong. </p><p>Christoph</p>									</div>

					<p>Good Morning,</p><p>yes your 2 points are correct..... i have order new antennas via amazon...and a don&#039;t know a better device for 2.4GHZ </p><p>But i think eduroam is also reachable in 5 GHZ in some areas.... this is written on the homepage of some universitys and on my university is written </p><p>In all areas is 802.11g supportet, in some also 802.11a.<br />In manny buildings the accespoints can use 802.11n, occasional alsow 802.11ac</p><p>So i think the second sentens stands for 5 GHZ or is it fals ?</p>									</div>

					<p>The antennas outside are for 5G and very long for this frequency. I don&#039;t know whats inside of the antennas.&nbsp; It could be they have more than 3dB. But you can remove&nbsp; they and you are able to connect other antennas. The connector locks like SMA or reverse SMA.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dnkru</strong> on 13 Feb 2017, 12:49)</p>
