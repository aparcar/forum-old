					<p>Hi i tried to get the multicast routing up and running with igmpproxy but soon i have discovered that CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST<br />CONFIG_IP_MROUTE are disabled in kernel build ... as i have no experience with building openwrt and know only little about unix/linux is there any other way to get an image with these option enabled. i am able to configure many things in openwrt but i do not want to brick my router with badly builded firmware.... if there will be someone who will build an image for me i will be very gratefull .... i have Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 ... i am using this image <a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/snapshots/brcm-2.4/openvpn/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz â€¦ uashfs.trx</a> so latest kamikaze generic broadcom with 2.4 kernel openvpn package (so every that stuff openvpnserver, kmod-tun and so) .... if you will be building the firmware you can add these extra packages there: cifsmount, igmpproxy, kmod-fs-cifs, ntpclient, libblkid, mount-utils, ntpclient, openssh-sftp-server, openvpn-easy-rsa ..... also there should be an webif2 (which is part of that standard image, but i just noted) ,,,&nbsp; cause my brothers are turning wifi on or off and they will not manage to do it from console ....also i do not need any usb and ppp or ppoe support so remove those packages.. or if there is noone who will help me ... at least give me som good hints and link ho to build own image ... cause i havent found a good one yet ... thanx again</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dulus</strong> on 8 Jan 2009, 16:05)</p>
