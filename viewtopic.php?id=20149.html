					<p>Three recent postings on wireless usb have gone unanswered--I hope this doesn&#039;t suffer the same fate.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have not found any thread which documents success with wireless usb in openwrt, although there have been several announcements of success.&nbsp; This wireless usb stick installed and worked without a problem on an alix 3c3 under slax linux.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to install a wireless usb device on a NSLU2.&nbsp; lsusb reports it as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Bus 001 Device 002: ID 148f:2573 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT2501USB Wireless Adapter</code></pre></div><p>When I boot with kmod-rt2500-usb installed, dmesg reports as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>phy0 -&gt; rt2500usb_init_eeprom: Error - Invalid RT chipset detected.
phy0 -&gt; rt2x00lib_probe_dev: Error - Failed to allocate device.</code></pre></div><p>Googling on &quot;rt2500usb_init_eeprom: Error&quot; shows that this is a common occurrance, apparently because the vendor/id code was reused with a different chipset.&nbsp; The recommended fix is to use the kmod-rt73-usb module.&nbsp; I have that installed (after removing kmod-rt2500-usb), as shown by &quot;lsmod | grep rt&quot;<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rt73usb                15872  0
