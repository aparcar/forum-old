					<p>So, I&#039;ve been doing some research and I DO know that this is a crappy version (every single post I&#039;ve found states that it wont work) but hear me out:</p><p>Is it possible even in theory to flash absolutely minimalistic version of OpenWrt to this crappy device, and extend its memory using MMC mod.<br />After applying MMC mod, install other packages into the MMC and live happily ever after ?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>List of supported platforms:

					<p>Not sure why you are quoting Atheros chips on a Linksys that is Broadcom based...</p><p>but it isn&#039;t just a matter if it is possible.&nbsp; YES, it is possible.&nbsp; dd-wrt has demonstrated this (2MB of FLASH).</p><p>It is what is your time worth?&nbsp; When more modern 802.11n routers are now down to USD $35 or less, how much effort can be put into a router where the vendor cut the legs off it and sold the WRT54GL (still rather limited, why didn&#039;t they put 32MB of RAM like earlier models)?</p><p>if you value your time at very low... then yes, you can do it.&nbsp; But for most people just easier to sell the router used and go get a better model.&nbsp; What is your net cost, an extra $15 to $20?</p><p>yes, I know that all Linux ideals aren&#039;t driven by economic practicality - but there is a point where most people agree the results are not worth the effort.</p>									</div>

					<p>do it and report back. I suspect you could get it working. the 8mb ram will likely be your biggest problem, it&#039;s hard to do anything with that.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thats true, any idea how fast (slow) that MMC might be ?<br />I mean, its propably something near serial port speeds, so it might cause more harm to use a few megabytes as swap ?</p>									</div>

					<p>i&#039;ve seen speed quoted up to about 500kbytes/sec. if you can&#039;t load your entire userland without it, then use it, surely. things might be usable once it&#039;s doing routing, that&#039;s all kernel code.</p>									</div>

					<p>t is perfectly posssible to run openwrt on 2mb flash router although a striped down version...... but the way i see it i think the wrt54g v7 has potential try to make a minimal image yourself or use the one&#039;s&nbsp; from this forum</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17252">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17252</a></p><p>look at these and change the kernel modules to support you hardware .......</p><p>a better option is to make a minimal functioning linux with opkg and support for SD/MMC over gpio support then later all packages can be installed to memory card</p><p>choice of a bootlloader is also a concern using the redbootloader from ddwrt is good as it save space... </p><p>the trickiest part is getting all together and finding gpio pins.....</p>									</div>
