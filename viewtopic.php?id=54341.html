But I don&#039;t see any usage of &gt;16 MB flash, unless someone decides to use that as a mini desktop computer someday. I have a router with 16 MB flash. After installing all the openwrt packages with features I wish from a router at present, in near future and features I might never use, it still has ~2MB empty space! And the official firmwares from manufacturers often come with linux 2.6.x kernel and very limited feature set compared to what openwrt packages offer. Moreover, router manufacturers often don&#039;t encourage people using third party OS. So, why do they bother putting freaking 128MB flash there?</p><p>Can someone enlighten me please?</p>									</div>

Practically there are &lt;5 802.11AC routers in the openwrt router list. More or less same for dd-wrt. Yet, 802.11ac routers have been existing in the market for over three years. Unless manufacturers are secretly collaborating with openwrt/ dd-wrt developers, I don&#039;t see much opening up of drivers or at least integrating them as libraries in open router OS (openwrt,dd-wrt/tomato...). On the other hand, the manufacturers don&#039;t seem to bother revolutionizing the routers themselves either. </p><p>I guess you are right- when insignificant amount of money can buy significant amount of memory upgrade and thus user attraction, why not?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmrasheed</strong> on 1 Dec 2014, 18:52)</p>

Perhaps they are following the incremental model, significant upgrade of flash and RAM once in 3-5 years. Or, perhaps they can&#039;t find legit answer to the same question, why? Perhaps when the mist of IoT becomes a little clearer, router manufacturers would get the answer to this question, and we will see routers with mac mini config. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Edit: I was checking the TP-link Archer C7 router specs and inside pics. And I completely agree with you. Beside all the gigantic&nbsp; specs (and chips on board), flash memory seems silly. Couldn&#039;t they spare few more cents/router for better marketing and neck to neck fight with the top names!?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmrasheed</strong> on 1 Dec 2014, 19:47)</p>

					<p>Things I believe we could use it for… saving more logs longer, backup and perhaps recovery mode when upgrading… even dual boot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Long blacklists of evil sites. Hosting the compiler. Of course much flash provides little extra value at the time being since 1) most routers have more limited flash, and OpenWRT will be constructed/configured for little flash in a long time, 2) a USB memory with like 16GB still costs almost nothing, and more internal flash provides few advantages.</p>									</div>

					<p>I kind of disagree, frankly speaking I prefer the 16MB NOR flash then 1GB NAND flash, for a sysupgrade operation a NOR flash takes 2 mins maximum a NAND flash can take up to 10 mins because of the erase cycle in each flash.</p>									</div>
