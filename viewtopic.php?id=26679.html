					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m pretty new to openWrt. Even though I&#039;ve assisted a conference about the openWrt project, I haven&#039;t really paid a deep attention to the project until today.<br />I have a bit of a &quot;problem&quot; and I think that openWrt could solve it. To be sure and to be guided a bit for the start, I&#039;ve decided to post this message.<br />I hope the question hasn&#039;t been posted already.</p><p>So basically, I&#039;m looking for a router that could suit my needs.</p><p>On one end, I have a PPP server that allow multiple connection since the MAC address is the same at each request.<br />On the other end, I have a couple of computers that would love to have an IP delivered by this PPP server.<br />Of course the MAC addresses of the different computers are different.</p><p>That&#039;s why I&#039;ve been thinking about a router a bit special that I could put between my computers and the PPP server that would rewrite the source MAC address of my computers&#039; frames by its own to communicate with the other routers.</p><p>Once the IP allocated, the router would receive frame from computers, record in a routing table the IP source and the associated MAC address, change the source MAC address by its own and send it to the other routers. When a frame is sent to one of my computers, my router would look for the source IP address and change the destination MAC address by the one that my targeted computer has. My router wouldn&#039;t have any IP address, which is not necessary.</p><p>Once the IP address is allocated to a computer, the process seems quite simple (I think), but before that, you can&#039;t make an entry in the routing table because the computer still has no IP.</p><p>That&#039;s why I would like a filter on the DHCP requests. I do not want the router to send it to the other routers.<br />Once an DHCP request is sent by my computers to the broadcast, my router should not have the default behavior to send it to it&#039;s WAN output and rewrite the source MAC address, but instead send a PPP request on this output to the PPP server and send the answer as a DHCP frame to the computer.</p><p>I currently have a WRT54G2 that doesn&#039;t seem to be supported. I&#039;m willing to buy a new router, not very expensive (less than 60 bucks) that could support openWrt and the project that I&#039;m having in mind.</p><p>That could be cool, if you have ideas of packages and some recommendations of a router.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Richard.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pretender</strong> on 23 Sep 2010, 22:42)</p>
