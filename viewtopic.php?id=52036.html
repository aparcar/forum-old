					<p>There&#039;s no easy way, at all. A few things to consider:</p><p>a) LuCI has no concept of user roles and restrictions.<br />b) Removing single tabs requires some knowledge of LUA and LuCI internals, it&#039;d be a bit complicated.<br />c) An easy but messy way would be to remove <em>all</em> tabs. That would of course render the interface rather useless.<br />d) Even if you manage to remove the tabs the pages themselves still exist. So someone who knows where to look would still find the respective pages. You could of course also remove the pages themselves, which would leave an even greater mess.</p><p>There is nothing stopping you from editing LuCI completely to your liking. I believe it could even be extended to show different things to different users. But it&#039;d be quite a task, again, LuCI doesn&#039;t ship with user roles and how to treat them.</p><p>All that being said, the tabs are generated in /usr/lib/lua/luci/view/themes/<em>your_theme</em>/header.htm ... Proceed at own risk.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 6 Aug 2014, 02:17)</p>

OpenWRT itself has no user roles, and it&#039;s whole design philosophy has no concept of privileges or access management.</p><p>There are a couple things you could do, for example, not giving the user access to LuCI at all but having your own, standalone, web authenticated configuration page for just the wireless. Or use a different OS that has fine-grained access control to begin with.</p>									</div>

					<p>LuCI does, however, have at least some rudimentary awareness of system users (even if OpenWrt by default only ships with a root user and some proforma users for the daemons). I wonder if this could be leveraged into a graduated web interface.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 6 Aug 2014, 02:39)</p>
