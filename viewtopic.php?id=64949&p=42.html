					<p>@davidc502<br />Been updating as usual, and want to thank you again for your builds.</p><p>Yesterday I updated to your latest, r3063. Kept settings, and everything started fine. Came back home today, and router had rebooted. I decided to see if l could replicate this, and see if the router was overheating. Rebooted router again, opened an ssh terminal and speedtest tab. I issued the sensors command, and ran the speedtest. The speeds were around 35mbps, which was lower than my regular 100mbps. The sensors showed temps of ~77 for the CPU, and the router then crashed.</p><p>Rolled back to r2695. I have no idea what the issue is, as 77 degrees seems pretty low compared to what the temperature triggers are for the fan. I wonder what the issue was for people that had issues with the test build.</p><p>If there&#039;s any tests or commands that you would want me to run to learn more, let me know.</p><p>--ThePatrikos</p>									</div>
