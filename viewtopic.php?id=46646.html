					<p>Hello! I recently flashed my Linksys E900 router with firmware openwrt-e900_v1-squashfs.bin found in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/</a> via the router internal admin page (192.168.1.1). Unfortunately, the ethernet connection between my PC and the router broken at 30% process and now I cannot connect to the router via TCP/IP to reupload new firmware (either via the web interface or via CFE - needs ftp upload).</p><p>My current condition is the router is accessible via serial, showing OpenWRT console but inaccessible via TCP/IP - I cannot detect WiFi or connect to the router via ethernet (cannot ping or tftp). I tried send the firmware using cutecom (plain and x/y/zmodem mode) and minicom (ymodem mode), but the attempts are either failed (when using x/y/zmodem) or completed but I cannot find the binary in the router (when using plain mode).</p><p>I also tried to connect to my router via my internet router - connect the bricked Linksys E900 router to the internet router using ethernet cable, to both the internet and ethernet port of Linksys E900 router, but it is still undetected on my network.</p><p>Any suggestion how I can install new firmware in this condition? Thanks a lot!</p><p>P.S I can go to the failsafe mode and already perform steps described in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a> - but still my router WiFi and TCP/IP is broken. Furthermore, is this problem in installation or just means the E900 OpenWRT image I used is faulty?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bontorhumala</strong> on 7 Oct 2013, 05:54)</p>

					<p>If you have serial, you should be able to enter &lt;CTRL-C&gt; in early boot to get to a CFE prompt.&nbsp; At the CFE prompt, enter &quot;upgrade code.bin&quot;.&nbsp; After that, you you should be able to tftp either openwrt (device specific .bin file) or the stock firmware.&nbsp; See here for reference:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/bootloader/cfe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/bootloader/cfe</a></p><p>and</p><p><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2013-September/021346.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope â€¦ 21346.html</a> (suggest reading the entire thread)</p>									</div>

					<p>How did you install E900 firmware? I&#039;m pretty sure that every installation method should wait for the whole firmware before writing it to the flash. So if it failed at 30% nothing should happen.<br />If on the other hand the firmware was received by the router but you powered it down during installation (it can take few minutes to write firmware to the flash!) then your OpenWrt is likely corrupted.</p><p>Anyway, broken OpenWrt shouldn&#039;t stop you from talking with CFE and installing new firmware using CFE &amp; tftp.</p><p>Since you have a serial console, please provide full boot log, starting with CFE and ending with OpenWrt booted.</p>									</div>

					<p>Forgive me, masters... I used straight cable instead&nbsp; of cross, no wonder I never able to tftp between my PC and the linksys router. For anybody face the same problem:</p><p>1. Set ethernet ip address of your pc ---&gt; sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2<br />2. Connect your PC ethernet cable port and the router ethernet (not internet) port using cross cable<br />3. Reboot your router to CFE mode using serial console, press ctrl+C repetitively right after you plug in power to the router<br />4. Set ethernet ip address of your router ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now you should&#039;ve been able to ping between devices<br />5. In the CFE prompt, type --&gt; upgrade code.bin<br />6. In your PC, set tftp server<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tftp IPv4.x.y.z<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tftp&gt; binary<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tftp&gt; rexmt 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tftp&gt; timeout 60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tftp&gt; trace<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Packet tracing on.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tftp&gt; put code.bin<br />7. Voila, your router should have receive the packet and continue to install it. After finished and you see success message, enter ---&gt; reboot</p><p>P.S. I use the router original firmware</p>									</div>
