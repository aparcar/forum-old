					<p>Hello.<br />I have a seagate dockstar and a d-link dwa-140.<br />I have already succeeded in installing openwrt attitude on a usb pendisk and boot the dockstar from it.<br />My goal is to use this setup as a wireless router/AP.<br />Can someone help me doing that?

Thanks for your reply.<br />Indeed I am afraid I wasn&#039;t completely clear about my hardware.<br />The Seagate Dockstar is, as you probably already know, a plug computer with an ARM CPU.<br />On the other hand, the D-Link DWA-140 is a USB wireless adapter.<br />The plug computer doesn&#039;t have a built-in wifi adapter and for that I would be using the D-Link adapter.<br />Using a serial connection between the plug computer and my laptop, I installed Jeff Doozan&#039;s bootloader. Using that bootloader, I have successfully booted the Dockstar with OpenWRT from USB pendisk.<br />And I have also successfully installed kmod-rt2800-usb_3.3.8+2012-09-07-3_x86.ipk for the D-Link wifi adapter.<br />Now I have to find out how to make a wireless router out of a OpenWRT install on a hardware that has both wired and wireless adapters.<br />Hope you can point me in the right direction. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>john3voltas</strong> on 20 Jun 2013, 11:26)</p>

The difference between your project and mine is WiFi. Before you proceed any further, I have one question to ask you. Just exactly how much throughput will you expect this WiFi connection will be able to sustain? I don&#039;t know about the DLink DWA-140, but please don&#039;t be disappointed if it can only sustain less than 5 / 1 Mbps download / upload throughput. When I built mine with a cheap USB/RJ45 dongle based on a DM9601 chipset, my Dockstar could only sustain about 4.5 / 1.4 Mbps download / upload throughput. I am planing to get another USB/RJ45 dongle based on an AX88772x chipset to test. I hope this type of USB/RJ45 dongle with an AX88772x chipset can sustain more than 80+ Mbps download throughput.</p><p>Anyway, if I were you, I would rather build/compile my own OpenWRT firmware for my Dockstar. This way, I can add any packages as I wish.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Mazi,<br />I&#039;m doing this with Dockstar+Dlink for testing purposes only.<br />My aim is somewhat similar hardware: I intend to buy a Iomega iConnect (ARM cpu with wifi and wired embedded) and a wifi mini pcie card.<br />You see, since the onboard Iomega wifi adapter is very poor, I was thinking on upgrading it with a <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Atheros-AR9287-AR5B97-Wireless-Card-BGN-300M-WIFI-Half-Size-Mini-PCI-E-/300722305177?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4604723899">atheros ar9287</a> adapter. I think the atheros ar9287 is much better than the onboard thingie.<br />Since my living room router doesn&#039;t have enough power to provide wireless in the bedrooms, I would like to use the Iomega as a wireless AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know how much you are going to end up paying for all of the devices by the time your project is completed. However, if you had a budget of US$75, you certainly can buy this <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/MK809-III-Quad-core-RK3188-1-8GHz-Androind-TV-Box-4-2-HDMI-2GB-RAM-8GB/961718921.html">Quad core RK3188 1.8GHz Androind TV Box 4.2 HDMI 2GB RAM 8GB ROM Bluetooth Wifi Dongle MK809III</a> US $49.20 / piece + US $13.68 to United States Via China Post Air Mail (a total of US $62.88). It is based on an RK3188 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A9 CPU clocked @1.6GHz with 2 / 8 GB RAM / NAND. It supports BT as well as WiFi b/g/n. I really don&#039;t know how good the WiFi is. However, you can connect a USB/RJ45 dongle to its USB port and turn it into a NAT/Firewall/WiFi router. Of course, you will either need to migrate to an Android platform or start a new development platform for OpenWRT to support this device. This Quad-Core Cortex A9 CPU is definitely much faster than the ARM CPU used on an IOmega iConnect device.</p><p>Now the cons part. The S/H cost of US $13.68 is too pricey, AFAIC. The problem buying things online with expensive S/H cost is another S/H cost to ship back the defective product. Foreign online sellers know this and sometimes they use it as a tool to dump defective products because they know the buyers would hesitate to return the defective products for a replacement due to an expensive international S/H cost. Anyway, if the S/H were free, I would probably buy two units to start playing around with it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 23 Jun 2013, 16:52)</p>

					<p>Hi Mazi.<br />I know those dongles. I got the older dual core (rk3066).<br />It&#039;s a nice gadget but the wifi sucks to say the least.<br />It&#039;s ok for casual gaming/browsing/media playing. Besides there&#039;s no support for openwrt.<br />Either I buy a proper router and flash it with openwrt, or I&#039;ll use the iomega.<br />Cheers</p>									</div>
