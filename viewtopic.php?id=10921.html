					<p>Hello Everybody.</p><p>I have a WRT54GS with OpenWRT 0.9<br />There is 1 client connected via cable to the router.</p><p>Now i want to add a 2nd client via wlan, but i need WOL ( wake on lan ) <br />to start the 2nd client. I think there is no wlan-card which supports wol, <br />so i think a i&#039;ll buy a 2nd WRT54GL, connect the 2nd client with a cable to the new WRT54GL an build a WDS with the existing WRT54GS</p><p>Can i send wol packets via WDS from WRT54GS to WRT54GL?<br />So that the WRT54GL receives the wol packet via WDS Bridge, und send the packet via cable to the 2nd client?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just install to the second wrt54gl openwrt and wol. Then you can execute the wol command form the second wrt54gl and you don&#039;t need to send the wol command via wds.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for your reply.<br />This is also a possibilty. Why did I not come an this idea ?</p><br /><p>Do you know whether it is theoretically possible to send the wol packet via wds?<br />i think its just interesting to know...</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry I don&#039;t know if it possible. I guess it should be somehow but I don&#039;t know how. I think the easiest way is to execute the command from the second router. Maybe someone else know if it is possible.</p>									</div>
