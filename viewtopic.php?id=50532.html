					<p>Firstly, I assume this is with a very recent trunk.&nbsp; Normally one gives the rxxxxx number so readers know.</p><p>A button &quot;to turn on the wifi&quot;: do you mean that the interfaces (radio0 and radio1) are detected but do not present setup screens; or the interfaces are not detected by the system? Remember that there are two freq 2.4 and 5.1GHz so two radios, 2 APs.</p><p>Have you rebooted the system via a poweroff/on and then tried again?</p><p>PS: see here <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15856#comment:7">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15856#comment:7</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ryts</strong> on 9 May 2014, 01:45)</p>

					<p>Hello ryts,</p><p>it was trunk r36051. And yes i can see two interfaces on the screen, but im not able to configurate them. I can turn on the 2,4 Ghz interface. For the 5.1 Ghz is a switch as well on the screen, but if im using it, nothing happens. If the 2,4 Ghz is working, im able to see the ssid with my phone and lap top, but if im trying to connect, my phone is waiting to get a ip. After few minutes the connection is broken. And there is no possibility to set a WPA protection, or something else. </p><p>I would like to use both interfaces. And sorry for my poor english-skills :-)</p><p>El_chmuro</p>									</div>

					<p>Trunk currently stands at r40742. Strange, as your posting read as if from someone who had just flashed the router.&nbsp; Did you upgrade? I would suggest trying something more recent. BUT, there may be wifi issues right at the moment, as an aspect of the web interface is under change as I referenced in my post above.&nbsp; </p><p>I use a OpenWRT flavour called ROOter (gives 3/4G via USB to WWAN) and it is built periodically from trunk.&nbsp; I have had issues with wifi on the wdr4900, and removing the interfaces, rebooting and reconfiguring them usually got things going. (Old configuration files if preserved in an upgrade can cause issues due to changes in OpenWRT). But once or twice, a version of ROOter/OpenWRT did not work well on wifi. I last tried r40396 and never got wifi going but have not had time to look at this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well,</p><p>i always used DD-WRT on my router, and everything was easy. Now bought this one to use OpenVPN, this router is with 800 Mhz performant enough, but it doesnt work wit DD-WRT. Anyway, i used this trunk&nbsp; image, because it was in this instruction <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4900">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4900</a> </p><p>I never used openwrt bevore, im not sure, which trunk image is compatible with my router. when im etablished the first connection via ssh, i did a update with:<br />opkg update</p><p>If there is another working new image, just let me know, how to update, and im going to check it out.</p><p>THX</p>									</div>
