					<p>Hi,</p><p>After years of using the free dyndns.org service and dynamic update clients, Dyn has decided to change their policy requiring login on their website once a month.</p><p>So now I&#039;m looking for a new free dynamic DNS provider.</p><p>I tried no-ip.com but the dynamic update client in OpenWRT didn&#039;t work.</p><p>I&#039;d like something that just works using the LUCI DDNS plugin, but I&#039;m not averse to setting up a DNS server on a collocated server that we have at work. In fact, I&#039;ve been wanting an excuse to switch our company&#039;s DNS from hosted to hosting ourselves anyway.</p><br /><p>Suggestions?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Colin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cthart</strong> on 15 May 2013, 23:06)</p>

					<p>Is there any way to automate the new monthly login requirement?</p><p>While irritating, I find myself preferring to stay with dyndns if possible.&nbsp; I run my own mail server and web server, and it would be kind of a pain to change all those urls, particularly my email addresses.&nbsp; I&#039;m not opposed to eventually even paying for that convenience, but finances are such that at the moment, it&#039;s better for me to login monthly.</p><p>One of the reasons I opted for dynamic DNS years ago was to have a permanent email address on a server I ran.</p>									</div>
