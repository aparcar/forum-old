					<p>So my dad lives in the sticks, rural Oklahoma.&nbsp; It&#039;s fairly flat and there are perhaps 150-200 familes in the area.&nbsp; There is no wired ISP available, and it does not appear there will be any time soon (next 5 years).</p><p>I was considering setting up a Wireless ISP at his place - I can get a T1 line out there, but would prefer to subsidize that connection&#039;s cost by rolling it out for like a 5 mile radius - I feel very confident I can get enough accounts to make it profitable.</p><p>I wanted to use the Linksys WRT&#039;s with openwrt as the end point nodes and spend some fairly significant cash on outdoor directional antennas (like $35 each or so) for each of them to tie the end sites onto the central ISP&#039;s antenna.</p><p>Does anyone have any experience like this?&nbsp; I&#039;ve done a fair amount of reading on it and it looks doable, but I have questions as to the central antenna and brocast piece - what should I consider using?&nbsp; </p><p>Does this sound viable as a possibility?</p><p>I have as much as $10,000 to use to implent this, providing I can make back my investment.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jim</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you would do best, to start by looking around at broadbandreports.com WISP forum.</p><p>Starting a WISP involves a lot of things. OpenWRT might be a small part of it or it might not. You need to start from the other end of the problem. Site surveys, consideration of what frequency you SHOULD use as for NLOS you may want 900 MHz.&nbsp; Not start from the assumption that you will use WRT and let that dictate everything.</p>									</div>

					<p>In designing your system account for an effective throughput of up to 8 MByte over that kind of distance between two boxes. So that may in practice serve some 6 families but not more.<br />When operating multiple access points from one spot you can play with directional antennas each covering a particular direction, alternating polarization between adjacent antennas to minimize crosstalk, and note that the channel setting is misleading.<br />E.g. 802.11 b/g channel 6 is not confined to channel 6 but also radiates inside 2 channels up and down. So effectively you can only operate three APs inside the 12-14 channels when they &#039;see&#039; each others signals with very high fieldstrenght. <br />For local distribution of signals we see reliable performance when an access point uses an 8 element collinear vertical antenna and each client an 18 dB 1 meter long yagi antenna. That works smoothly to about 2 km with line of sight with either side reporting 54 Mbit rate in g mode, that is when they don&#039;t have something cooking in the microwave.</p><p>Fully agree with Vincentfox that it takes much planning of the topology, line of sight considerations, and required capacities. Would also suggest, considering the number of families to use 802.11a (5.47-5.725 GHz) technology as it provides more spectral space, gives more antenna gain for a certain antenna dimension, and is less disturbed by other applications like microwave ovens; but it takes more $$$.&nbsp; Perhaps a hybrid set-up can do the trick.<br />Make sure you use boxes and firmware in the long-distance links that can change the timing of 802.11 to adjust for propagation delay; without it the data throughput breaks down. In OpenWrt this distance setting was recently added. </p><p>Would suggest to define clusters of clients that all have their own long-distance link (e.g. on basis of 802.11a) from their local access point (802.11g) to the end point of T1. <br />You may also need a license to operate a telecom company....</p><p>(this message traveled per 802.11g 1500 m to a local AP and then 7500 m to reach the nearest copper with adsl)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 9 Mar 2006, 19:11)</p>

					<p>Build your backhaul first.&nbsp; You can use 802.11a and run up to 4W of power and then use 802.11g<br />for the Access Points from there.</p><p>Map your network topology.</p><p>Do you have a current web page for this project?&nbsp; If yes, then post the URL.</p><p>Does not seam like a hard project but it will take time.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m just going to post this anyways for informational purposes in case anyone else is thinking of implementing this idea.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen this way to much where wireless hobbyist try to implement something along these lines without any experience in WLANs outside their home or office.</p><p>He&#039;s some quick down and dirty facts on the feasibility of implementing this scenario.</p><p>1.&nbsp; Surveying:&nbsp; A professional site survey is needed.&nbsp; Expect the cost to be in the ballpark of $1000 to $5000.&nbsp; Outside surveys tend to be in the higher range of cost.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s possible to get a &quot;Surveyor&quot; to do it for less, but those are usually folks who are hobbyists who try to hire out their services.&nbsp; Most will not provide you the level of detail that you&#039;ll want and need (I.E. Detailed topographical maps with signal readings, Spectrum analyzer readings, capacity levels, equipment specs, optimized configurations, Fresnel zone calculations, Inline power requirements, etc).&nbsp; If you try to skip this step and &quot;do it yourself&quot;, you are asking, no, begging for major headaches when and if you actually are up and running.</p><p>2.&nbsp; Going the homebrew route:&nbsp; While OpenWRT is an awesome package; its purpose is for SOHO (small office/Home Office).&nbsp; If you really want to become a WISP, you&#039;ll need an enterprise class of AP.&nbsp; Cisco/Airespace, Aruba, Trapeeze, Symbol, Intermec, are but a few vendors in this arena.&nbsp; Enterprise class APs are more rugged (internally and externally) and offer the flexibility for upgrading and remote management that you&#039;ll need unless you plan on spending every waking hour doing on-site trouble calls and constantly tweaking settings manually.&nbsp; Enterprise class APs range from $200 to $1000.</p><p>3.&nbsp; Who&#039;s that knocking on my door?:&nbsp; Study the FCC regulations (Part 15 and all the clauses).&nbsp; Something as minor as using an antenna on an AP that is not licensed and approved &quot;as a system&quot; can put your lights out permanently.&nbsp; $10,000 a day per violation (per AP and antenna) is a costly price to pay because you decided to use a Cisco 10 dBi yagi on a Linksys wireless router.&nbsp; Each antenna configuration has to be approved by the FCC for use with that specific piece of equipment.&nbsp; Ignorance of what can work with what can be the death blow to your operation.</p><p>4.&nbsp; Legal stuff:&nbsp; How and where are you going to mount all those APs? Unless you own all the property, you are going to need some kind of legal agreement with the property owners to place you equipment where you need to.&nbsp; It costs money to hire a lawyer to draft up and file the required paperwork, licenses, and to represent you in the lawsuit because you skipped step 1 and failed to follow NEC grounding and someone&#039;s house burned down or worse, killed them because they were near your improperly grounded equipment.&nbsp; I know that sounds extreme but it does happen.&nbsp; The OP mentioned he/she is in Oklahoma.&nbsp; I know from personal experience that Oklahoma state and local grounding requirements are very strict.&nbsp; As I&#039;m sure the OP knows, there is ALOT of severe weather that happens there.&nbsp; Your equipment is going to get taken out eventually.&nbsp; Just make sure you don&#039;t kill one of your customers too.</p><p>That is but a few things to consider in implementing a WISP.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even get into the &quot;3 hop rule&quot; or backup WAN link.&nbsp; </p><p>Feel free to add to this.</p>									</div>
