					<p>At first it can seem very simple to modify a wireless router - just &#039;click, download and install&#039;. But if you want to go much further it is needed to know, and have experience with, the hardware itself. </p><p>I have announce the attempt at kicking WIP-Day into reality --&gt; <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11193">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11193</a></p><p>Now I would like remind that the first WIP-Day will take place on the up-coming saturday, from UTC 12.00 and 24 hours ahead. It will take place on #openwrt-devel, so just login if you would like to get your fingers (and tools) into hacking hardware.</p><p>If you are new to &#039;hardware hacking&#039; on embedded devices and OpenWrt - or would like to spend some community time collaborating with other members on a new &#039;hack&#039; the coming WIP-Day could be an opportunity. <br />There is room for all kinds of activities, and a few exmaples could be:</p><p>- A &#039;hack&#039; which helps with cooling --&gt; <a href="http://xs316.xs.to/xs316/07264/DSCN3328.JPG">http://xs316.xs.to/xs316/07264/DSCN3328.JPG</a></p><p>- Another example could be the brainwashing of la fonera and adding OLSR meshing to it --&gt; <a href="http://wiki.freifunk-hannover.de/Fonera_mit_OLSR">http://wiki.freifunk-hannover.de/Fonera_mit_OLSR</a><br />(though this guide needs to be translated into english, which could be a project in itself).</p><p>- Or, if you just feel insecure about the process of installing an image via tftp, then help would be at hand.</p><p>If you have other ideas or things you need help with add it to this thread and/or join on saturday.</p>									</div>
