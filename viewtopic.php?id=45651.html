					<p>Hello, I have a problem with my TP-Link router (with OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment 12.09 final).</p><p>Network speeds are hanging around 9Mbit/s on this router, if I connect the internet cable directly in my PC I get the full 60Mbit/s! I have this problem on LAN and WLAN.<br />the original firmware from TP-Link does not resolve this problem, I don&#039;t have many Wi-Fi networks here so that is not my problem.</p><p>Does anyone know a solution for me?</p><p>EDIT:<br />Found the problem, my network cable is broken so it runs at 10baseT!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Chrisiesmit93</strong> on 6 Aug 2013, 00:06)</p>
