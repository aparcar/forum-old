I&#039;ll try to set it manually, but it doesn&#039;t make sense, since it has worked that way in previous versions of OpenWRT.</p><p>You are partially right about the channel. I need to have one master without a sta, otherwise the ap has no channel to lock on to.<br />I think that&#039;s a bug: If I have ap+sta and the station is not in a connected state, I&#039;d expect the ap to send beacons at either a predefined channel or on an automatically chosen channel, what it does not, if the sta is active.</p><p>It seems that the hostapd portion of code waits until sta is connected, and only then activates hostapd.</p><p>So I have to use a (cabled) ap in ap only mode, so that my segment can connect the first sta, which will then trigger the ap, which will allow the next sta to connect, ... that doesn&#039;t make my segment fault tolerant...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>epek</strong> on 22 Nov 2015, 01:56)</p>
