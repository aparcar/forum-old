					<p>Hello everyone, i would like to use several openwrt routers over the time. Openwrt is great (and some packages, like mwan3), sure could be greater if more users would contribute a bit more with the wiki &amp; stuff but that is another story. </p><p>The most problematic part for me is finding an embedded device (no x86 boxes) that is well supported and has 5 gigabit ports plus usb (for pivot overlay). I thought about the tplink wdr3600, it fits perfectly my needs but it seems that is discontinued now (discovered too late <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> ). Mikrotik devices are good but the installation is a bit time consuming, for me the ideal installation is through tftp or webgui (like the wdr3600 or the asus 500gpv2). </p><p>For what i saw on the Toh of supported hardware it seems that the netgear wndr3700 is quite stable, but it is also sold since years so i do not know if it will be discontinued soon.</p><p>Therefore, in the meanwhile i search on my own, i wonder if some other person has found a good, powerful and reliable solution as embedded hw plus openwrt that is unlikely will be discontinued soon.</p><p>Thanks for the answers.</p>									</div>

Therefore i was trying to find a patter of the sold model that are supported by openwrt. Of course what sells is likely to stay on the market until the next upgrade. Now tplink wdr3x00 /wdr4x00 series i guess sold well since 2012 and now they are updating it, i&#039;m quite sure that openwrt will support the new batch of updates too but i would like to buy time to go over this period. (on this will happen again at the next update, but it will be in 3 years more or less. According to the pattern that i collected)</p><p>So for now could be that i can just buy a buffer of wdr4300 or wdr1043n that are still well sold, supported by openwrt and so i can wait a bit more. Nevertheless i wanted to use the chance to see if something exists&nbsp; that is more or less standard. Like a raspberry. (i&#039;m even thinking about a possible kickstarter project to somehow design few standard models of &#039;open source&#039; routers. Starting small and then, let&#039;s see how the community reacts)</p><p>In the company we used some industrial boards, but even them have some problems. For example with an atom d525 and a ich8m chipset, openwrt is unable to use different metrics on the same interface. Dunno why. So while industrial baords are stable model, could be that have some subtle quirk with openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pier4r</strong> on 19 Sep 2015, 16:48)</p>
