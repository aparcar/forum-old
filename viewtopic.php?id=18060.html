					<p>Hi,<br />Trying out 8.09. One of the interesting aspects is the 2.6 kernel with wireless support:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Broadcom 47xx running reliably with the new Kernel, including b43 wireless driver<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - WEP, WDS and multi-SSID not yet supported<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - AP mode and STA mode are supported with WPA, WPA2, or no encryption</p><p>Looks like some hard work has been put in to get wireless working with the 2.6 kernel on broadcom.<br />Is that the case?<br />I see the release.txt says:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Wireless no longer supported on older Broadcom devices (bcm4710/bcm94702)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Support was dropped in upstream Broadcom wl driver and b43<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - b43legacy (which adds support for such hardware) might be added in a future release</p><p>That&#039;s not gonna affect the Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 tho?</p><p>Anyway. The 2.4 kernel version flashes fine as expected. All seemed ok, so I tried the 2.6 version. Flashes, but I get nothing out of it at all. Can&#039;t telnet 192.168.1.1. Ping 192.168.1.1 nothing. No DHCP on any ports.<br />I can flash back to 2.4, no problem.<br />Hmmm, the WHR-HP-G54 is not broadcom 47xx based. Perhaps that&#039;s why? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />So no 2.6 for my router?<br />Many thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gildenman</strong> on 14 Dec 2008, 20:37)</p>

					<p>Replying to my own post. Sad <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m still a little confused about the status of the 2.6 kernel for the WHR-HP-G54.<br />In May, sbrown, posted about his success in getting a 2.6 kernel with b43 driver<br />running on the WHR-HP-G54.<br />Post #8 of this thread:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15443">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15443</a></p><p>I see that there is 2.6 kernel version of 8.09-RC1 for the Linksys WRT54GSv4 here:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09_RC1/brcm47xx/openwrt-wrt54gs_v4-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 â€¦ uashfs.bin</a></p><p>According to the hardware pages, that router is based on exactly the same hardware as the WHR-HP-G54.<br />Well it has the same Broadcom 5352 integrated solution.</p><p>Considering all this, why is there no 2.6 kernel version for the WHR-HP-G54?<br />Is it planned or am I missing something?<br />Many thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gildenman</strong> on 15 Dec 2008, 15:06)</p>

					<p>Don&#039;t expect proper linux 2.6 support for these devices until the next release after 8.09<br />8.09 is still on linux 2.6.25, as later kernels aren&#039;t ready yet. 2.6.27+ is required for using a recent version of b43</p>									</div>

					<p>if i&#039;ve understand you , it is not possible (yet?) to get any version (snapshot or so) of the brcm47xx on a WHR-HP-G54&nbsp; like it works on the WRT54G ?<br />is there really such a difference?&nbsp; would mean that there is no solution for <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4061">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4061</a>&nbsp; ?</p>									</div>
