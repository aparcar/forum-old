					<p>Hello,</p><p>I just flashed BB 14.07 to a TP-Link Archer C7 v.2.0 (AC1750) and I am experiencing *very* slow wifi performance on the clients. Its like down: ~8mbps up: 8mbps&nbsp; .... while with stock fimware it was down: 60 mbps up: 15mbps. I am measuring with speedtest.net app and website. Tried nearly all encryption modes and also without encryption. 2,4ghz only - as I cant test 5ghz yet.</p><br /><p>Anyone else here have same experience with this router and OpenWRT?</p><br /><br /><p>Regards,<br />CHERRY*</p><p>Archer C7 Wikipage: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CHERRY*</strong> on 3 Jul 2015, 18:36)</p>

The v2.0 does have a newer chipset for the 5GHz band, but 2.4GHz is the same. The 2.4GHz wifi driver is roughly unchanged from much older models and is quite stable. There was one bug that seemed more common with android devices that would occasionally lock that wifi band. This has been fixed in CC.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok i tried CC 15.05 rc2 with manual luci installation. Wifi 2,4ghz android speedtest.net app ... Down: 16mbps up: 15mbps. With stock i get &gt; 20mpbs.

					<p>Please try to isolate whether the problem really is with wireless, or perhaps elsewhere.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest installing &amp; starting iperf on the router (or another LAN-attached device, which would be better if you want to compare to stock) and using an iperf client on your Android/iOS device to verify what throughput you can achieve on wireless.&nbsp; Speedtest is quick and easy, but there are so many variables involved that makes it inappropriate as a tool to troubleshoot wireless throughput with.</p><p>(As an aside, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any relation between your issue and the one in the link you posted.&nbsp; That person was mostly concerned with why he was getting &quot;only&quot; 500Mbps on his 5 Ghz radio (802.11ac.)&nbsp; You&#039;re not using 5 Ghz (ath10k driver in the C7&#039;s case) and you&#039;re not stuck with a &quot;ceiling&quot; of 500Mbps.</p><p>Other possible variables you should try eliminate:<br />-- the stock firmware may have used a different wireless channel, and that there is interference/contention on the wireless channel OpenWRT is currently set to use<br />-- the stock firmware may have used a 40 Mhz wide channel, which would also impact results.&nbsp; Ensure that you have like-for-like setups (apologies if that&#039;s what you did, but your post does not provide enough information to be sure.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I finally was able to do some iperf tests and it seems that the bare wireless-speed is nearly the same - still the performance with Internet speed is horrible slow on WiFi speedtests. So the problem might not be the wifi controler itself ... But what could slow down the performance that much? As I said its a fresh install.</p><p>@Atom: Do you have more ideas? please <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CHERRY*</strong> on 12 Jul 2015, 21:22)</p>
