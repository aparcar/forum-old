					<p>I have not yet completed my SD mod but I am curious as to how to use it already (counting my chickens before they hatch <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />).&nbsp; I am going to be using a car that is 128MB and would like to use it primarily to store extra packages and the like.&nbsp; How would I go about moving packages, and even the default installation location, to the SD card?&nbsp; What would be the easiest way of doing this, or the best?</p><p>Thanks for the help!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duffin</p>									</div>

					<p>not sure if that&#039;s what your looking for but you can add a new entry to /etc/ipkg.conf</p><p>and then use &quot;-d&quot; in the ipkg command like so:</p><p>ipkg -d sd install mypackage</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow, I didn&#039;t see your post for some reason and managed to figure that part out myself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.&nbsp; I also added /mnt/sd/bin and /mnt/sd/usr/bin to my path variable.&nbsp; However, where are the library folders defined? (where /lib and /usr/lib are defined to be special folders).&nbsp; I want to add /mnt/sd/lib and /mnt/sd/usr/lib to it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this is the right way of doing things, but so far it seems to kinda work.&nbsp; If I could just get the lib folder to be recognized then I wouldn&#039;t have any problems.&nbsp; </p><p>One problem that I ran into pretty quickly was fat&#039;s inability to create hardlinks.&nbsp; So, I formatted the SD card with ext2 (using the package from nico&#039;s experimental repository) and loaded the kmod-ext2 package (also from nico&#039;s experimental).&nbsp; Now the SD card has ext2 and is able to be mounted and all is well, except for the lib thing.</p><p>If anyone has any ideas or ways to refine what I am doing please let me know.&nbsp; Once I have got everything working perfectly I will post a tutorial on the wiki, so help me get this right....please!</p><p>Thank you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Duffin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Duffin444</strong> on 14 Nov 2005, 10:54)</p>

					<p>Here I am replying to myself again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.&nbsp; I actually figured it all out.&nbsp; The environment variable that sets the path to the libs is LD_LIBRARY_PATH.&nbsp; The reason that it was difficult to find is that it is not defined by default (at least I couldn&#039;t find it).&nbsp; My guess is that it is assumed to be /lib and /usr/lib if it is not defined.&nbsp; Anyway, I will be writing a wiki page detailing how to install and use packages on a remote drive (in my case an SD card).</p><p>Thanks,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Duffin</p>									</div>
