					<p>DarioX7,<br />I know you have contacted some of the OpenWRT devs here. Could you explain to us why they insist it is so difficult to add support for this router since new linux 4 kernel have already implemented support for this SOC. <br />I already migrated to AC standard but was wondering how can we get the most out this hardware. </p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to get LEDE installed on the WNDR4700 as well.

Instructions for installing:</p><p>1) Read the following documentation: <a href="https://www.lede-project.org/docs/index.html">https://www.lede-project.org/docs/index.html</a><br />2) Download the Factory image: <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/apm821xx/nand/lede-apm821xx-nand-WNDR4700-squashfs-factory.img">https://downloads.lede-project.org/snap … actory.img</a><br />3) Flash the LEDE factory image firmware as a firmware upgrade.<br />4) SSH in and enjoy!</p>									</div>
