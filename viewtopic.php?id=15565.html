					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have built the latest Trunk / SVN for the Fon / Atheros and have ran into a strange problem.&nbsp; I have a serial cable and am able to see that the firmware loads successfully without issue.&nbsp; I have also removed all the packages and custom scripts I usually include to rule out that they are not causing the issue.</p><p>The firmware built is the basic barebones of what is necessary.&nbsp; The 2100 boots successfully (verified via serial cable console) and I can ping the ethernet port with the IP 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; Using the serial console I have turned off the firewall to rule out it is causing the problem.</p><p>When I telnet into 192.168.1.1, it connects successfully, meaning no &#039;could not open connection / could not connect&#039; error messages.&nbsp; However, no banner page or command prompt is seen in the telnet window.&nbsp; Just a cursor sits at the telnet screen.&nbsp; For fun I typed the command (even though I can not see what I am typing or what the output is) &#039;reboot&#039; and the fon router restarted successfully.&nbsp; I connected to telnet again, and again from a blind console, ran &#039;passwd&#039;, set a new password and was able to reboot again.&nbsp; After the reboot I am no longer able to telnet in and tried a SSH connection.&nbsp; Same thing as telnet, SSH connects, but just a cursor on the screen, no &#039;could not connect&#039; error message.&nbsp; However, I was not prompted to accept any RSA keys.</p><p>As another test, from the Serial port console, I enabled HTTPD and tried browsing to 192.168.1.1 in my browser and the web page does not load.&nbsp; Again, manually disabled the firewall before this test.</p><p>As yet another test, I created a wireless interface, and connected wirelessly and I am able to connect via SSH with no problems at all.</p><p>The big indicator to me is that telnet (prior to runnins passwd) over the ethernet port will accept my input/commands, but no output/results is shown in the screen.&nbsp; Has anyone ran into something similar with the latest SVN for Atheros?</p><p>Any insight or advice is greatly appreaciated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hard_where</strong> on 5 May 2008, 18:17)</p>

					<p>Update:<br />The problem happened when using the kernel version 2.6.23.16, but have since compiled with both 2.6.24.5 and 2.6.25.1 and telnet and SSH are working correctly.</p>									</div>
