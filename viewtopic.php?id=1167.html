					<p>I was having all sorts of link problems with GCC 3.3.5/C++ from the 03/13 experimental release so I started hacking.</p><p>The errors were all about missing symbols that were related to the &#039;SJLJ Exception Handling&#039;, which is turned on by default with GCC&#039;s --enable-sjlj-exceptions configure option.</p><p>I ended up changing toolchain/gcc/gcc-uclibc-3.x.mk by hand and simply removing the references to the BR2_GCC_USE_SJLJ_EXCEPTIONS variable. This might not be the correct way to do it, but it worked for me.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if the SJLJ stuff was enabled intentionally. Is it possible that is simply does not work yet on this platform?</p><p>If someone can tell me the correct behaviour of the SJLJ stuff then I can make an official patch.</p><p> S.</p>									</div>
