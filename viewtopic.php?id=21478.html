					<p>Hi,</p><p>I spent a lot of hours trying to make this work out but I couldn&#039;t.<br />I have internet connection at home and I would like to make it work in a circus space wich is 300 meters from my home.<br />My idea is:</p><br /><p>Internet&nbsp; ----------ethernet---------&nbsp; AP1(home)&nbsp; ------Wireless link WPA------&nbsp; AP2 (circus) (dhcp server)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wireless&nbsp; Ethernet cable<br />192.168.1.0 (home network and AP1) |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All in 192.168.2.0: AP1 and AP2 and all AP2 clients</p><br /><p>The AP1 is a Linksys WRT54G<br />The AP2 a nanostation2<br />Both with openwrt kamikaze</p><p>At the first time I thought that the wireless link beetwen AP1 and AP2 must be WDS if I want that AP2 be a client of AP1 and ap to connect people to internet. But it doesn&#039;t work and web interface of AP1 hasn&#039;t WDS option.</p><p>I tried many configurations but they didn&#039;t work. I downloaded the squashfs version for both AP.<br />I have no problem with AP1 with wan (internet) and lan (wifi)<br />But I have problems making work AP2, the lastest tried was configure two entries in wifi device. One as client of AP1 and the other one as AP and that works, but not at all, I have internet in AP2 because I can ping internet into it, but wireless and ethernet clients of AP2 can&#039;t connect to internet.</p><p>Can you explain me how can I configure this idea ? Is it possible ?</p><p>Thanks in advance !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ferriol</strong> on 21 Aug 2009, 00:56)</p>

					<p>AP2 needs to be an AP to allow people to connect. <br />Therefore it must either be a repeater (bridge) of AP1 or AP1 must be one of its clients.<br />To keep it simple would suggest to start with AP1 as client (sta) and AP2 as access point (ap).</p><p>The problem now is that by default AP2 defines its internet gateway to be via wan.<br />So the solution to the problem is redefining the default gateway to be on the lan (bridged combination of wlan and lan), namely client AP1.<br />(/etc/config/network; the naming AP1 is now misleading as it is not an AP anymore).<br />The dhcp settings of AP2 may point to itself as gateway and dns server as long as AP2 knows where to <br />find the next gateway and dns server (being both on its client AP1).</p><p>Communication capacity to the internet is half what would be possible with an additional radio at AP2&#039;s position <br />just talking to AP1; in the current set up any packet received by AP2 also needs to be transmitted by AP2.<br />With an additional radio you could then do the wireless towards internet on another IP subnet and radio channel than wireless inside the circus and make AP2 do routing.<br />To give an example; if a PC in the circus would communicate with a printer in the circus that traffic would not show up at AP1 and consume radio link capacity.<br />In your current set-up it will.&nbsp; </p><p>But in general look for the solution to the problem in the route tables at the various hubs, specifically what the defaults are, and check that dns look up works.</p>									</div>
