					<p>Hello OpenWRT developers,</p><p>I have created a new project that you might find interesting: myWRT</p><p>It is based on OpenWRT, but with some notable differeneces:<br />1. I have created a new build system using OpenWRT&#039;s make files. I have tried to use the existing system at first, but found it too frustrating, as it broke everytime I tried to change some aspect or include a package in the firmware image. I have modularized the build system: Each package has its own directory and the Makefiles are independend. Build dependencies are set in the master Makefile. Because of this, packages can be built outside of the source tree just as easily.<br />2. All optional components can be configured through a&nbsp; menu-driven configuration system (a modified version of the one in the Linksys tarball)<br />For every component you can choose, whether it should go into the firmware image or into an external .ipk package<br />3. The resulting firmware image is fully OpenWRT-compatible and I intend to keep it that way.<br />4. I have included some nice features not yet included in the OpenWRT CVS buildroot (like optional LZMA compression for the squashfsroot)</p><p>I started hacking on this a few days ago and it seems pretty stable right now. Build dependencies are already handled properly, so if you change the configuration, you don&#039;t need a full rebuild, which saves a lot of time.</p><p>I haven&#039;t integrated all of OpenWRT&#039;s packages yet, but the core is complete and for the rest, you can use OpenWRT .ipk files. It&#039;s also easy to port .mk files from OpenWRT over to my system.</p><p>You can download my current version 0.1 at <a href="http://sf.net/projects/mywrt/">http://sf.net/projects/mywrt/</a></p><p>If you&#039;re interested - just give it a try.</p><p>Hint: You can copy or symlink over your existing OpenWRT downloads, for most packages I use the same version.</p>									</div>

					<p>RaBiDFLY, that&#039;s an unnecessarily harsh line of questioning.&nbsp; You imply that no-one should make a derivative work of OpenWRT without first attempting to work with the OpenWRT developers.&nbsp; What a load of rubbish.&nbsp; Being open source, anyone is free to do whatever they want with OpenWRT, provided they keep to the conditions of the GPL, which is what nbd has done.</p><p>Nbd has not gone off and made his own OpenWRT fork - not that there&#039;s anything wrong with doing that either.&nbsp; myWRT is basically OpenWRT with a different, easier compilation procedure.&nbsp; What&#039;s wrong with writing it, getting it working, and then coming back and saying &quot;hey guys, what do you think of this?&quot;.&nbsp; It takes the load of the core developers, for one thing.</p><p>I for one have found compiling OpenWRT and its packages quite difficult, and I can imagine that quite a few potential package developers have been put off by it.&nbsp; An easier compilation system like myWRT is what I&#039;ve been hoping for.&nbsp; If you can configure and compile a linux kernel with menuconfig then you&#039;ve got the skills required to compile myWRT.&nbsp; I have those skills and yet have great difficulty consistently compiling OpenWRT - something always seems to be broken.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one in this situation.</p><p>I don&#039;t expect OpenWRT&#039;s maintainers to come up with such a system, either.&nbsp; They seem to be flat-out keeping the core system compatible with the new hardware and firmware releases that Linksys keep throwing at them - rather important work I think you&#039;d agree.&nbsp; myWRT is not the sort of system the maintainers need, anyway.&nbsp; myWRT is aimed at advanced-end-users like me.&nbsp; Anything that makes OpenWRT easier to contribute to has to be a good thing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree with danversj.</p><p>Good job nbd!<br />I personally wont be changing because I have finally come to grips with the bits of buildroot that I care about.</p><p>Had this been around a couple of months ago, I would definitely have given it a spin.</p><p>I think this will definitely make it easier for new user to build their own images and with a bit of luck the best parts of&nbsp; myWRT will filter into OpenWRT before too long.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your replies! I think it won&#039;t be hard for me to continue to integrate features from OpenWRT into MyWRT, if I just keep monitoring the CVS buildroot changes and the forums. If there&#039;s any way I can help you without having to dig too deep into the OpenWRT build process, just tell me.<br />The whole reason for starting my project wasn&#039;t even to make it usable for end users. I tried to build my own custom firmware for a specific purpose and just found it too complicated to mess around with OpenWRT the way it is currently. My primary design goal was to make it as easy as possible for me to change any aspect of the source without having to care about so many details of other parts.<br />Now, with some more effort on my side, perhaps I can create something, that&#039;s essentially like OpenWRT, but usable by ordinary Linksys/Sveasoft users.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, speaking for the openwrt developers, we&#039;re simultaneously glad to see people working on openwrt and a little insulted by the fork. Basically, we know about the flaws in openwrt and have been working on a new, yet to be announced version.</p><p>Try to understand that OpenWrt was started to end this silly game of taking existing firmwares and adding one feature to make a &quot;new firmware&quot;. The idea was that the openwrt firmware itself would contain only common components and that users would be able to create addons using the jffs2 filesystem, thus allowing endless customizations. Lately however, we&#039;ve been plauged by questions of &quot;how do I install packages into the firmware itself?&quot;, usually from people that are flashing multiple devices and would like to avoid having to configure each one -- a feature addressed in the new version.</p><p>So while we understand the purpose of &quot;mywrt&quot;, we really wish someone would have mentioned it to us first, as the need for it will most likely be eliminated in the comming weeks.</p>									</div>

					<p>It was just a question.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /> </p><p>I for one look forward to a nice easier interface to build custom packages. Everytime I want something that hasn&#039;t been added it&#039;s a nitemare to throw it all together. So far I&#039;ve just copied Nico&#039;s setup to build packages. Not to mention that when I sync the cvs repository with with my end I by hand move everything over.</p><p>Anyway, I was just asking if he had tried to join the club. Obviously he&#039;s allowed by the GPL to do what he has done, and I certainly don&#039;t have a problem with him doing so. I&#039;d just love more core OpenWRT developers working together to make this an even greater project!</p><p>I&#039;m not much for arguing about things and you don&#039;t know me from a hole in the wall, but just so you know. If I was trying to stir up trouble, there would be no question about it.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" /> </p><p>Dan</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>RaBiDFLY, that&#039;s an unnecessarily harsh line of questioning.&nbsp; You imply that no-one should make a derivative work of OpenWRT without first attempting to work with the OpenWRT developers.&nbsp; What a load of rubbish.&nbsp; Being open source, anyone is free to do whatever they want with OpenWRT, provided they keep to the conditions of the GPL, which is what nbd has done.</p><p>Nbd has not gone off and made his own OpenWRT fork - not that there&#039;s anything wrong with doing that either.&nbsp; myWRT is basically OpenWRT with a different, easier compilation procedure.&nbsp; What&#039;s wrong with writing it, getting it working, and then coming back and saying &quot;hey guys, what do you think of this?&quot;.&nbsp; It takes the load of the core developers, for one thing.</p><p>I for one have found compiling OpenWRT and its packages quite difficult, and I can imagine that quite a few potential package developers have been put off by it.&nbsp; An easier compilation system like myWRT is what I&#039;ve been hoping for.&nbsp; If you can configure and compile a linux kernel with menuconfig then you&#039;ve got the skills required to compile myWRT.&nbsp; I have those skills and yet have great difficulty consistently compiling OpenWRT - something always seems to be broken.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one in this situation.</p><p>I don&#039;t expect OpenWRT&#039;s maintainers to come up with such a system, either.&nbsp; They seem to be flat-out keeping the core system compatible with the new hardware and firmware releases that Linksys keep throwing at them - rather important work I think you&#039;d agree.&nbsp; myWRT is not the sort of system the maintainers need, anyway.&nbsp; myWRT is aimed at advanced-end-users like me.&nbsp; Anything that makes OpenWRT easier to contribute to has to be a good thing.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

I think OpenWRT is an amazing project. Personally I&#039;m taking a great advantage of it at my work. I&#039;d really love to contribute more in developing, but I&#039;m not an expert. All I can do is help some people in the forums or in the IRC as often as I can.</p><p>I saw all the arguing between TheRoDent and Kaloz. I was really surprised of the situation... I couldn&#039;t really understand why was Kaloz blaming at TheRoDent, but I think it was just a misunderstand that, being as it was, their first contact, led into a &#039;never will get on well&#039; relation. I think Kaloz misinterpreted TheRoDent&#039;s intention, thinking he was showing up or something like that (maybe he was, who knows), but afterwards, The RoDent showed he was really good willing and a good developer. He got a working image out of the new linksys sources in a few days (three if I&#039;m not wrong) and even if he felt himself insulted (having been or not, I don&#039;t judge this) he offered it to anyone they needed (like me).</p><p>I am infinitelly thankful to The RoDent; I have 250 WRT54G 2.2, and they&#039;d be still waiting for a working OpenWRT if it weren&#039;t for him.</p><p>But we can&#039;t forget the work Kaloz, mbm and the others do. They&#039;ve always been very helpful and polite in the IRC and the forums and have developed the project by themselves...</p><p>As I said in the begining, I agree with you that we need as many core developers as possible. I really feel sad when I see a situation like this between The RoDent and Kaloz, both working for a common project and collaborating the minimum as posible... We all (including you both, Kaloz and TRD) would win a lot if you worked together...</p><p>Keep on working guys, you do it so well, and your work helps a lot of people every day.</p><p>Thank you ALL</p><p>yissnn</p>									</div>
