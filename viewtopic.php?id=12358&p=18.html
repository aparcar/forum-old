					<p>@domadm:<br/>The new builds are just new builds. If everything is working on your router, then stay with it.<br/>Otherwise check out the changes between your version (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/17399">17399</a> I assume) and the new builds.<br/>Upgrading within OpenWrt is described in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=92789#p92789">#376</a>. It will try to keep your configuration, but additional packages have to be re-installed.</p><p>If I remember correctly there is a OpenVPN plugin for X-Wrt, but it was client only.

					<p>@drizzt81:<br/>Glad to see you have a working serial access.</p><p>Your router is currently in &quot;download mode&quot;, a special Sercomm recovery method.<br/>I never needed to use that method, but there are some people that had (see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=89989#p89989">#343</a> and <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=90551#p90551">#352</a>).<br/>If you succeed with &quot;download mode&quot;, please add missing or additional information about it in your post. Thanks.</p><p>You can also use a &quot;wrt350n.bin&quot; file from a stock firmware release (see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=92928#p92928">#378</a>).<br/>relghuar&#039;s full-image.bin from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=74729#p74729">#188</a> is identical to the &quot;wrt350n.bin&quot; of the 2.00.17 stock firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maddes.b</strong> on 3 Sep 2009, 20:11)</p>
