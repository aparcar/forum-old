					<p>Getting an alcatel speedtouch usb modem to work is fairly easy - enable the right kernel modules, make sure you got support for ppp over atm, get the firmware for the modem and compile the modem_run application which is used to load the firmware.<br />So, yes there is at least one usb adsl modem that works with OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have built packages to use the Thomson/Alcatel speedtouch USB ADSL modem -- I put instructions in <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3867">this post on the developer board</a>.&nbsp; You can skip the first step and just download them ready-made if you prefer.&nbsp; I am keen to hear any feedback.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a speedtouch 716wl and was wondering if your installation procedure would work with that router. The router has an integrated VoIP and port for a phone line and I was wondering if openwrt would support that functionality. Also, if you have managed to get it working for a Thomson Speedtouch should you not inform whoever maintains this list - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a>?</p>									</div>

					<p>The speedtouch USB/330 is a USB modem which may be plugged into any router with a USB port and supporting openwrt. It is not itself a router, nor to my knowledge does openwrt install on any of Thomson&#039;s routers.</p>									</div>
