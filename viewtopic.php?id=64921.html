					<p>Ok. That seems to be the correct file, and it sounds like you are using the emergency and not the GUI update. I had some issues when using v15.05.1 on my old routers (not your exact problem) but found that v15.05 flashed and worked fine as a release download, I then created my own builds using the image builder of v15.05.1. So all I can suggest just now is to try v15.05 and see if you have a different experience.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 18 May 2016, 20:52)</p>

					<p>Out of interest have you tried the normal web interface? I&#039;m not expecting it to work (as described), but I have no further ideas (try an even older release) other than to hope that someone else has experience with your unit. Sorry.</p><p>Edit: you may be able to flash an older factory version, something pre 2.14 and then use the normal web interface.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 18 May 2016, 23:04)</p>
