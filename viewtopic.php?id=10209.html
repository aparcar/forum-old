					<p>Has anyone load tested a WRT54G with OpenWRT?&nbsp; I was wondering what the maximum number of connections or users outbound (Internal to External) it can handle and also how many concurrent pptp connections it should be expected to handle and also the traffic I should be able to put through it (ie server NAT traffice from WAN to LAN).&nbsp; I was thinking of deploying this to an office of about 25 people with 1 mail server and 1 web server in the back end.&nbsp; Is this asking to much out of a WRT54G?</p><br /><p>thanks a lot,</p>									</div>

					<p>Indeed I dont have any testing results but I dont see any problems connection 25 people and 2 servers to WRT54G, as long as you dont want them all to connect via openvpn over wlan to the router...</p>									</div>

					<p>No but I would like somthing that could handle the regular network traffic, server traffic and a few vpn (pptp) connections simultaneously without compormising stability.</p>									</div>

					<p>Will the WRT54G in your setting work as VPN &quot;server&quot; or &quot;endpoint&quot; - or will traffic only pass thru? </p><p>For just routing traffic, the WRT54G will do fine I&#039;m quite sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>The scalability will depend on the actual hardware involved; OpenWrt will do just as well as the original firmware, if not better so read the specs carefully when you&#039;re buying the hardware. If you just want to run it as an access point pretty much any device will work, if you want to install services and a firewall you&#039;ll want to consider the number of active connections and get a device with enough ram and cpu power to handle it.</p>									</div>
