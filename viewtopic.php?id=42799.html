					<p>Hello guys!<br />I need to access my router anywhere and anytime. And it&#039;s does no matter where he is at currently time. How can I do that? Port forwarding and configure a home network is not suitable. <br />It is necessary that I could send the video stream and audio stream at the router. But how?<br />Come to mind are some ideas:<br />1) Write a program like a Skype, which will run on a remote server in real time, &quot;connect&quot; and the other side of the router, which will allow to exchange video and audio stream to specific protocols.<br />2) As the second party will sit with the browser, it comes to mind new technology WebRTC. But how to make it frienly with OpenWRT? It&#039;s browser technology ...<br />3) I heard of Skype and Asterisk on OpenWRT, but ...</p><p>What are your thoughts on this venture? I don&#039;t have a big experience in OpenWRT, maybe I missed something, it may have a ready solution, but the problem needs to be implemented. In general, I will appreciate any help.<br />Thank you. Sorry for my bad english.</p>									</div>

DDNS - it&#039;s simply domen name to my router ip address. <br />My router will change the location and automatically connect to the Internet via WiFi. It can send a request to the server, for example, to the PHP script, but the script to him not be able to apply directly via ip address, as not accessible from the outside. It probably need a third party that performs constant communication with the router and the server part, like Skype.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your router moves around ?</p><p>If the main problem is how to address your router/server, look into &quot;dynamic DNS&quot; services which allow your router to register its address w/ the service so that you can always access it by DNS name even if their IP address changes.</p><p>Messaging servers/systems are already a pretty fleshed out space:&nbsp; Look into servers using the XMPP protocol (started as the Jabber IM system but it&#039;s all IETF type standards now) and possibly the Jingle&nbsp; extensions for voice and video.</p><p>But your message is not clear (to me, anyway) what problem you are trying to solve.</p><p>[edit: ah, hadn&#039;t seen msgs 2 and 3 when i wrote this]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vhrm</strong> on 10 Mar 2013, 23:17)</p>
