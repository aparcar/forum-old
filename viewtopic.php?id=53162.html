					<p>Hi,<br />I have fiber 75Mbit/75Mbit that consistently tests to 85d/91u.&nbsp; <br />Using WNDR3800 overclocked from 680 to 800mhz.<br />The problem I had was that the Qos was limiting simultaneous max speeds, even if I just set it for uplink only.&nbsp; Dtaht of ceroWRT explained that the cpu hogger is the rate limiters, not codel.&nbsp; So without qos I could saturate up and down... but latency would come with that and no qos.</p><p>Another issue is that my fiber provider does cable tv and the video on demand feature uses the internet link to stream HD movies.&nbsp; This extra bandwith of streaming does NOT affect the internet download speed.&nbsp; Tested a movie at around 20 mbit, and still was able to push 84 down in speed tests... so the line itself is technically a 150 line, with reserved bandwith for their cabletv functions.&nbsp; The internet is what they throttle to whatever speed you pay (75/75, etc).</p><p>So, I recently played with the mi424wr REV I router that they provide for faster connections.&nbsp; <br />It has a somewhat decent rate limiter qos... <br />DMZ is broken, doesn&#039;t seem to work... but if you forward the ports as in the photo I attached, you can use your own openwrt port forwarding to successfully run services with no issue.&nbsp; I have ftp/rdp/vnc/remote openwrt ssh and webpage access working fine with this setup!&nbsp; </p><p>Also be sure to set the DDNS (dynamic dns) inside openwrt to use the webpage to find the wan IP... because openwrt router does not get the internet ip.</p><p>Now I can run max speed both ways with no latency issues.&nbsp; Also the netperfrunner.sh by cerowrt runs great as my router isn&#039;t maxed out cpu wise.&nbsp; I also run hosts blocklist and a few CIDR based blocklists through ipset linked to iptables.</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/m7l2nrr89/">http://postimg.org/image/m7l2nrr89/</a></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s28.postimg.org/6m3r3tfa5/FIOSwithdouble_NATqos.png" alt="http://s28.postimg.org/6m3r3tfa5/FIOSwithdouble_NATqos.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robnitro</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 05:06)</p>
