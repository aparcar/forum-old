					<p>First post to the forum, be gentle.</p><p>While trying to get my wrt1900acs working (sigh, troublesome), I messed around with a cheap GPS dongle I had bought.</p><p>The dongle is a vk-172, available for $12 on ebay or $15 on amazon.&nbsp; It appears to be a U-blox 7 usb gps (+other gnss) dongle.</p><p>I tried a lot of things, basically trial and error to get things working with no luck.<br />gpsd, ugps, etc.&nbsp; Searching for information didn&#039;t help.</p><br /><p>Then I found this application note from u-blox that gave me the hint I needed.</p><p><a href="https://www2.u-blox.com/images/downloads/Product_Docs/USB_with_LINUX%28GPS.G4-CS-07059%29.pdf">https://www2.u-blox.com/images/download â€¦ 059%29.pdf</a></p><p>I installed kmod-usb-acm and the device shows up as /dev/ttyACM0</p><p>This matches with the config file of the &quot;ugps&quot; app, which references ttyACM0<br />It even seems to (almost) work.</p><p>ugps is simple but does one job very well -- it will read nmea data from a<br />GPS device and set the clock from the date/time values in the datastream.</p><p>However, it didn&#039;t work for me.&nbsp; But it ALMOST did, so I continued.</p><p>checking the log I got a lot of errors:</p><p>RMC datagram has wrong parameter count got 10 but expected 11<br />VTG datagram has wrong parameter count got 8 but expected 9<br />GGA datagram has wrong parameter count got 13 but expected 14</p><p>So I found my way to the source code and located the problem.</p><p>The ublox nmea output leaves out some values, which leads to rows of<br />commas.&nbsp; The ugps code uses strtok which treats multiple delimiters<br />as one.&nbsp; (an error in this case)</p><p>so ugps/nmea.c should have this routine:</p><p>static int<br />nmea_tokenize(char *msg)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int cnt = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; char *tok = strtok(msg, &quot;,&quot;);</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while (tok &amp;&amp; cnt &lt; MAX_NMEA_PARAM) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nmea_params[cnt].str = tok;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nmea_params[cnt].num = atoi(tok);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cnt++;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tok = strtok(NULL, &quot;,&quot;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return cnt;<br />}</p><p>look more like this (or something better):</p><p>static int<br />nmea_tokenize(char *msg)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int cnt = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; char *tok = strchr(msg, &#039;,&#039;);</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while (tok &amp;&amp; cnt &lt; MAX_NMEA_PARAM) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *tok = &#039;\0&#039;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tok++;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nmea_params[cnt].str = tok;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nmea_params[cnt].num = atoi(tok);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cnt++;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tok = strchr(tok, &#039;,&#039;);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return cnt;<br />}</p><br /><p>I may figure out how to recompile the ugps openwrt binary, but <br />until then I thought I&#039;d pass off my findings.</p><p>Oh, I also tried getting gpsd + ntpd working.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t work<br />either, but I think requires a lot more configuring.</p>									</div>

					<p>I set up docker, got an openwrt build system going, compiled ugps and got it working, but it needs more work.&nbsp; It seems to be hard-coded to the author&#039;s GPS output format.&nbsp; Also, ugps doesn&#039;t really help share the system clock or keep it very accurate (system clock set if difference &gt; 2 seconds)</p><br /><p>So I tried gpsd + ntpd and it appears to work.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install kmod-usb-acm  # for vk-172 gps dongle
opkg install gpsd          # supports various nmea/binary gps protocols
opkg install ntpd          # real ntpd to replace busybox</code></pre></div><p>to configure gpsd, you have to change the gps device in /etc/config/gpsd:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config gpsd core
    option device    &quot;/dev/ttyACM0&quot;
    option port    &quot;2947&quot;
    option listen_globally    &quot;false&quot;
    option enabled    &quot;true&quot;</code></pre></div><p>to configure ntpd, you need to uncomment these lines at the end of /etc/ntpd.conf:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># GPS(NMEA)+PPS
server 127.127.20.0 minpoll 4 prefer
fudge 127.127.20.0 flag3 1 flag2 0

# SMA PPS
server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4 prefer
fudge 127.127.28.0 refid PPS flag3 1</code></pre></div><p>When I check the system, the clock is now correct, so I&#039;m happy it&#039;s working.<br />(router is not connected to anything, so it&#039;s not the ntp pool)</p><p>note that I don&#039;t understand all of this - I&#039;m unsure how ntpd is communicating with gpsd because /proc/sysvipc is empty and there&#039;s no ntp-utils available in trunk (need ntpq to check)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mike866</strong> on 29 Nov 2015, 03:54)</p>

					<p>rajiv,&nbsp; off the top of my head...</p><p>the changes I made to ugps are already given in comment 1, and I downloaded it from the source in comment 3: git://git.openwrt.org/project/ugps.git</p><p>I gave up on ugps because while it worked, it set the clock very abruptly, and after that it could drift for a long time and would only reset it again if it got way out of sync.</p><br /><p>On the other hand, as described in comment 5, I got gpsd and ntpd working together.&nbsp; They are part of openwrt and you can install them directly as binaries using &quot;opkg&quot; as shown.</p><p>Also I should mention, all of this applies to the dongle I purchased, a vk-172 dongle with a ublox-7 chip.</p><p>One limitation of this chip appears to be that it will report the time, but I don&#039;t think it will do PPS which will interrupt exactly at the second.&nbsp; NTP does slightly better with pps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mike866</strong> on 6 Apr 2016, 02:37)</p>
