					<p>Hi,</p><p>I was testing out rt-n56u against a wn612v2 on 2.4ghz performance. <br />Testing setup: main router 2.4ghz.<br />Both rtn56u and wnr612v2 at the same spot with only one turned on during testing. They are about 20feet away across two walls from main router. Both are set to station mode (wireless client).</p><p>I ran iw wlan0 station dump and notice the following:</p><p>rt-n56u:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx bytes:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;37833551<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx packets:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30475<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx bytes:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18052194<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx packets:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;23966<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx retries:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;13536<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx failed:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 799<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beacon loss:&nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beacon rx:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 298<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx drop misc:&nbsp; &nbsp;5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; signal:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-53 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; signal avg:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-53 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beacon signal avg:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 213 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx bitrate:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;144.4 MBit/s MCS 15 short GI<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx bitrate:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;78.0 MBit/s MCS 12<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; expected throughput:&nbsp; &nbsp; 40.191Mbps</p><p>wnrt612v2:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx bytes:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;66909517<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx packets:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;54627<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx bytes:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;11039868<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx packets:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28325<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx retries:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3597<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx failed:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beacon loss:&nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beacon rx:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3334<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx drop misc:&nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; signal:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-49 [-49] dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; signal avg:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-53 [-53] dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beacon signal avg:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 205 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tx bitrate:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;58.5 MBit/s MCS 6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rx bitrate:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;58.5 MBit/s MCS 6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; expected throughput:&nbsp; &nbsp; 35.705Mbps</p><br /><p>rt-n56u has substantially higher retry rate (56.5% vs 12.7%) and tx failure rate (3.33% vs 0%). When I was using rt-n56u as the main router I noticed much slower throughput and random latency spike on the 2.4ghz channel and thats why I decided to test the tx in station mode. </p><p>Questions<br />Is this simply a hardware difference or does it indicate that I have a faulty 2.4ghz chip for tx?<br />Am I looking at the right place to figure out the performance issue?</p><p>ifconfig packets statistics:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX packets:48634 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX packets:28854 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kyzhk</strong> on 20 Feb 2017, 11:32)</p>
