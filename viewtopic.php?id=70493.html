					<p>I was following the wiki page &quot;creating_packages_for_kernel_modules&quot; and build a simple kernel module. <br />it can be loaded in openwrt on the router(ar71xx), but i noticed the function is not working as expected.<br />i was using &quot;dev_add_pack&quot; to register an arp filtering function, but I noticed the function is receiving something weird. I was thinking it should be arch independent because it is only linux network stack things.&nbsp; </p><p>So it there any doc about how to build a kernel module on the openwrt build root environment which was setup on the CentOS6 ,and use in openwrt on router?</p>									</div>
