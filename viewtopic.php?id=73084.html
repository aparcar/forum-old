					<p>I tried to install OpenWRT on a TL-WDR3600 router, I do not know what happened in the process that when connecting via ssh only the BusyBox v1.27.2 () built-in shell (ash) interface appears and the LuCi installation does not exist.</p><p>I tried to install LuCi manually and then install another stable version but when running opkg update the system returns the following errors. I do not know if they are due to problems in the repository or in the connection to the internet.</p><p>Anyway, what I want is to install a stable version and unanswered questions torment me ...</p><p>Can a new update of OpenWRT be installed directly from BusyBox?<br />What would be the least risky solution?<br />By changing the URL of the repository, the installation of LuCi is solved?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg update
