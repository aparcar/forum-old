By the way I would like to clarify that this modding example is taken from the platforms with ready solutions <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ar71xx/files/arch/mips/ath79/mach-alfa-ap96.c">mach-alfa-ap96.c</a> (by the way there is still a way to hot-plug mmc) and <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ar71xx/files/arch/mips/ath79/mach-rb4xx.c">mach-rb4xx.c</a></p><p>This mode is useful because does not need to search free 4 GPIOs pin for the mod mmc_over_gpio.

After some days (somewhere around 10) I just get a usb disconnect for no apparent reason, meaning that my filesystem just gets ripped out instead of a clean unmount. In most cases, the journal can handle that, but I&#039;ve also had a completely messed up filesystem. Anyway, a few seconds after that disconnect, it reconnects and (due to uuid) gets automatically mounted to the right place. But since the filesystem has not been unmounted properly during the disconnect, there are now 2 or even more devices (say sda1, sdb1, sdc1...) mounted to the same mountpoint. And at that point I would be very concerned about data integrity. So that is mainly the reason, why I want to get rid of hotplug devices.</p>									</div>
