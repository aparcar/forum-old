					<p><strong>Testing methodology.</strong><br />The objective was to measure the speed of filesystems on the router with OpenWrt excluding the impact of other factors as much as possible. My TP-Link WR1043ND runs OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1-RC4. Kernel version: 2.6.32.25-1.<br />As an external USB-drive I used Samsung HD204UI connected to the router via SATA-USB controller based on Prolific Technology PL3507 chip. About 15 partitions with different FS and 1GB in size were created with the default settings. For comparison I also made a read/write test with unformatted partition - this rate can be considered as the limit of the hardware, because not any FS-driver is involved in this case.</p><p>As benchmark tool full version of <em>dd</em> was used. Thus the resources of the router were not spent on data transmission over the network and the corresponding server. To minimize source file read/write expenses on the router side, /dev/zero and /dev/null weer used, respectively. Multiple tests with a file of 800 MB on Ext2 gave 3% spread only so this file size was used in all tests subsequently. All filesystems were tested with 2 values of the read/write block size: 4 KB and 2 MB.<br />For the purity of the experiment unnecessary services and servers were unloaded for benchmark time; no router accesses except for SSH took place. In this state, the average CPU Idle was 99.7%.</p><p><strong>Results.</strong><br />The results are shown in the graphs. In some cases, the mount options mentioned.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3311/42769449.5/0_1d0abc_a2e837d9_orig" alt="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3311/42769449.5/0_1d0abc_a2e837d9_orig" /></span><br />In all tests the CPU Idle was 0% (measurements were performed on another iteration, as it might influence the results).</p><p>Reiser4, UFS, JFS, ZFS are not supported by OpenWrt, so not tested.</p><p>Hope this test will be useful for someone.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>XChesser</strong> on 3 Apr 2015, 17:18)</p>

					<p><strong>vplessky</strong>, yes, Reiser is a journaling file system but you must distinguish all data journaling and metadata only journaling. Both Ext3 and Ext4 support any of these kinds of journaling (see &#039;data&#039; mount option).<br />Reiser also supports both types of journaling so you should compare its results properly.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I am surprised though about relatively low performance of XFS file system.</p></blockquote></div><p>XFS is known for its high CPU utilization so results are predictable for the router I think.</p>									</div>

It is average speed not peak. I tested 16 FTP-clients in Linux with vsftpd on my router. Speed is much dependent on client! For me FOFF appeared to be the fastest client. Filezilla, ncftp make good work too. I also tested OS influence: 4 cross-platform clients were benchmarked both in Linux and Windows 7 on the same computer. Windows gave much worse performance. Such strange results were also confirmed by two other users (on non-English forum). Active/passive FTP-mode doesn&#039;t make any difference.<br />With Samba I get opposite results: Windows client is faster.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I tested just sequential read/write. I think it&#039;s the most common behavior for a HDD connected to router. Network storage is usual model of HDD use with router and in this case it&#039;s just seq operations that we see.<br />Another reason is lack of benchmark tools for OpenWrt. There are no packages for iozone, bonnie, dbench in repo. So dd is the only tool for OpenWrt that I see.</p>									</div>
