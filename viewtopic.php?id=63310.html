					<p>I have a C7 V2 that I purchased about 2.5 years ago for the sole purpose of running Open-WRT on it, I used it for a while then ended up bricking it after a supposedly successful upgrade (it said the flash was successful and the checksums were ok, but then upon reboot, no webGUI and no internet access). I just dug it out now since I actually have wireless devices with AC and I&#039;m disappointed with the cheap AC WAP I just bought (11 MB/sec booo!), so I&#039;d like to resurrect this baby, and restore the stock firmware (or use Open-WRT&#039;s, whichever has better 5 GHz AC) to take it&#039;s place.</p><p>To my delight it still boots up normally and actually grabs an IP via DHCP, but then it won&#039;t respond to pings while connected to a LAN interface :-/</p><p>The TFTP server asks for <strong>ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin</strong> on <em>192.168.1.66</em> (which is the non-routed interface of my desktop, connected directly to LAN port 1 on the C7), but the server never seems to serve up the file, so it just continually asks for it. The server itself works because I was able to grab the file using the Windows TFTP client. I tried using the stock Open-WRT firmware, the stock uncut firmware and the stock cut firmware. None of them download. I have no idea what the issue is since this is my first time ever doing this.</p><p><a href="http://www.imagebam.com/image/b00d38471221876"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://thumbnails114.imagebam.com/47123/b00d38471221876.jpg" alt="http://thumbnails114.imagebam.com/47123/b00d38471221876.jpg" /></span></a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brando56894</strong> on 12 Mar 2016, 16:52)</p>

					<p>V2, I&#039;ve already tried SSH and it doesn&#039;t work, neither does Telnet. I setup a TFTP server on my NAS (been meaning to do it anyway for PXE booting) and told my DHCP server where it was and then connected the C7 and booted it up into TFTP mode, then went to bed. As far as I can tell, nothing happened over night....</p><p>Edit: just realized why it didn&#039;t work, I never set the correct IP. I&#039;ll create a KVM for it and try again later.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brando56894</strong> on 12 Mar 2016, 16:55)</p>

					<p>[Dr. Frankenstein] IT&#039;S ALIVE!!!!!!

Just for the hell of it I connected the C7 to my switch and the NIC configured for 192.168.1.66 to the switch also and disabled my main NIC, then started up the TFTP server on my desktop and INSTANTLY it pulled down the image, flashed it, rebooted and I&#039;m back at the login page with Chaos Calmer greeting me! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> </p><p>I guess I didn&#039;t really need to get this new WAP and could have actually ditched the Verizon router about a year or so ago, also probably didn&#039;t really need the pfSense box either.

					<p>I don&#039;t remember seeing anything that said that you have to use a switch and not a direct connection, everything I read said &quot;give your PC the IP that it&#039;s looking for and connect the router&quot;, very general instructions.</p><p>I forgot how much I liked OpenWRT, I think I&#039;m going to ditch my pfSense box since it takes up additional space, it&#039;s noisy/hot and I can get the same functionality out of OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>From what I read earlier, having your PC Ethernet and the router LAN Ethernet connected to a powered-up switch helps in certain cases.&nbsp; That way your PC link will be up and waiting for traffic right at the moment you power up the router.&nbsp; Something about Windows 7 has problems with this, and the tftp connection window may be very short depending on model or circumstances or...</p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>
