					<p>Hello, </p><p>Someone could give me compiled chattr (ar71xx, MIPS architecture)? I dont find it on OpenWRT...<br />I found sources: <a href="http://193.87.95.148/openwrt/ar71/trunk/build_dir/target-mips_34kc_uClibc-0.9.33.2/busybox-1.19.4/e2fsprogs/">http://193.87.95.148/openwrt/ar71/trunk â€¦ e2fsprogs/</a></p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mirra</strong> on 29 Nov 2014, 18:25)</p>
