					<p>Will be not easy (cheap) to find somebody. Why do you need exactly this device ? I did my private mobile device using supported hw (MiniBox1), plus separate accu, plus USB-3g/4g. <br />It is never a good idea, first to choose the hw, and then to try to adapt the software to it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Im looking for something roughly the same size. Mobile with a battery and just lte sim card. I purchased the GL inet Mifi and nothing but problems with it with horrible battery life. </p><p>I havent found anything small and portable that allows for VPN setups as I work in USA but remotely from Europe and always have issues if I don&#039;t use a VPN. </p><p>I&#039;ve purchased 2 GL inet units, 1alcatel dongle, 1 large Asus router (just wasn&#039;t practical but worked great) and then this TP Link just to get access but keeping VPN on my laptop which I change computers for work and that&#039;s not practical. So already spent $700+ on routers and options that don&#039;t work.</p><p>I just looked for the minibox and not finding anything that shows it takes a sim card on lte. Some products out of China but thats how I ended up with GL inet bs...</p>									</div>

					<p>MiniBox1 does not take&nbsp; SIM; just USB-dongle. AFAIK, not all integrated 3g/4g-modems run on USA _and_ EU-frequencies.

					<p>Maybe there&#039;s an issue with my dongle because it won&#039;t run on anything I&#039;ve tried unless straight to the computer. Has to download a full program to run. Can you tell me which one you are using?</p>									</div>

					<p>I use a GL-AR150 with a USB stick modem from the country where I am located using a build of OpenWRT called Rooter from OfModemsAndMen.com .&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried VPN on this but it seems like it would work.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have from time to time used a battery pack and I think from all the routers they support, including the A5-V11 (about half the size or the GL-AR150 but half the memory and twice the current drain of the GL-AR150).&nbsp; From time to time I use a cheap ($8 four cell power bank from eBay which holds four 18650 cells) and it can last a day normally.&nbsp; &nbsp;I even salvaged the cells from a couple of to-be-discarded laptop battery banks.&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe the GL-AR150 and the TP703N may be your lowest current draws but the TP link only has 4M of memory where the GL has 8, enough for OpenVPN.</p><p>Is that something like you are looking for?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DonJuane</strong> on 16 Feb 2018, 19:41)</p>
