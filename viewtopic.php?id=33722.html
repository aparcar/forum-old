					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I recently built a vanilla OpenWRT firmware (clean pull from svn, select the appropriate firmware, build, no changing default packages, etc) and tried to flash it to the WZR-HP-AG300H.&nbsp; The SquashFS version worked great, but the JFFS2 gives errors.&nbsp; We have used JFFS2 in the past and prefer this for a few reasons, so was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction to get the JFFS2 version working for this router?&nbsp; The error messages are below.&nbsp; Thanks!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>BUFFALO U-BOOT Ver 1.00
