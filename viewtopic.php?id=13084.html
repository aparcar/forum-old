					<p>Maybe is something in the startup script. I&#039;ve flashed the router with the official image. Then i&#039;ve removed a line in /etc/config/wireless in order to activate the wifi interface. After a reboot a client can associate but does not get an ip.</p><p>Everything works fine if a restart manually both network and dnsmasq (in this order).</p>									</div>

					<p>I had similar problems with 7.09 on my ASUS WL-HDD-2.5.&nbsp; I never tried starting dnsmasq manually.<br />Downgrading to 7.07 fixed these problems.&nbsp; This image works fine for me, and the fixes in 7.09<br />don&#039;t give me anything I particularly need or want.</p><p>I now have a multi-SSID setup (that just tickles me pink) with different&nbsp; flavors of auth on each to test for various client configs.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rmarc71</strong> on 27 Oct 2007, 04:16)</p>
