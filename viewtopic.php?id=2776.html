					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am having a hair losing session with this problem It appears to be an ISP authentication issue but I&#039;m hoping someone else has covered this before. I have a Microcom modem attached to a serial port we placed on a WRT54GS running RC2. I want to be able to dial up to the internet using the modem but I can&#039;t find any real HOWTO on the topic. Using my Debian workstation as a test environment I am trying to get a working configuration but am not getting anywhere. Here is what I am currently doing:</p><p>I have the slhc and ppp_generic modules loaded - this creates the /dev/ppp device. <br />I manually created the /var/lock directory to accommodate the &#039;lock&#039; entry in the options file.</p><p>My /etc/ppp/options file:<br />auth<br />lock</p><p>My /etc/ppp/peers/provider file:<br />noauth<br />connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/provider&quot;<br />defaultroute<br />/dev/tts/0<br />38400<br />persist</p><p>My script is in /etc/chatscripts/provider:<br /># abortstring<br />ABORT BUSY<br />ABORT &#039;NO CARRIER&#039;<br />ABORT VOICE<br />ABORT &#039;NO DIALTONE&#039;</p><p># ispnumber<br />atdtxxxxxxxxxx</p><p># ispconnect<br />ogin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;frust@ration.net<br />word&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\qdamnit</p><p>I start the ball rolling by typing on the command line:<br />pppd call provider</p><p>The modem dials out and appears to connect to the ISP but then nothing and finally the line will drop.<br />My log output:</p><p>Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:12 (none) kern.notice pppd[731]: pppd 2.4.3 started by root, uid 0<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:13 (none) kern.info chat[733]: abort on (BUSY)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:13 (none) kern.info chat[733]: abort on (NO CARRIER)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:13 (none) kern.info chat[733]: abort on (VOICE)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:13 (none) kern.info chat[733]: abort on (NO DIALTONE)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:13 (none) kern.info chat[733]: expect (atdtxxxxxxxxxx)<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:58 (none) kern.info chat[733]: alarm<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:58 (none) kern.info chat[733]: Failed<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:13:58 (none) kern.err pppd[731]: Connect script failed</p><p>Seems as if failing on sending username and password?<br />I get the same thing on my Debian workstation although if I use pppconfig and then the pon and poff scripts I have no problem. Unfortunately I can&#039;t determine the difference and some of the options aren&#039;t supported on Opernwrt. Anyone?</p><p>Many Thanks.</p>									</div>
