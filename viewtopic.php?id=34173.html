					<p>I want to run Debian on my Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H. What follows is what worked for me and some background. Your milage may vary.</p><p>Simply chrooting into debian will not work, and we have to recompile openwrt.</p><p>On a powerful computer:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/
cd trunk/
./scripts/feeds update -a
make menuconfig # Target system=Atheros AR71xxx, Target profile=WZR-HP-AG300H, Advanced configuration options--&gt;Target options--&gt;Deselect &#039;Use software floating point&#039;
make defconfig
make kernel_menuconfig # activate &#039;Enable FPU emulation&#039;
make # firmware images will be put in bin/ar71xx/</code></pre></div><p>The final make will take some time (Â½ day on my atom netbook), but the build can be parallelized if you have enough cores. I used a small cluster at my university (32 Xeon cores, 64GB RAM) and did everything in /dev/shm (=half of RAM). Keeping everything in shared memory ram, does speed up the build up quite a lot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> So instead of half a day, it now takes just me 15 minutes.</p><p>Note that simply just enabling in-kernel FPU emulation should do the trick, however for some unexplicable reason, PCI wifi devices could not be found if I did not disable msoft-float. <br />Disabling this is safe enough, but FPU operations becomes even slower (has to trap into kernel mode, instead of just calling a library function in user-space). Also in-kernel FPU emulation is not compiled in per default in openwrt, as msoft-float (for obvious reasons) is used. Debian packages are however not compiled with msoft-float (and you don&#039;t want to recompile all the debian packages!), so slower FPU emulation must be used.</p><p>Then simply scp openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-ag300h-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin to /tmp on your router, and update the router:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sysupgrade -v openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-ag300h-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</code></pre></div><p>Now, with the FPU-stuff taken care of, chrooting will no longer hang and we can actually install debian with debootstrap. I may post how to do this later.</p>									</div>
