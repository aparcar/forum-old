					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am looking for a small repeater that is supported by openwrt and that can get network uplonk from a lan port. It shall directly plugg into a wall socket.<br />WLAN ac with dual band would&nbsp; be great.<br />TP-Link RE200/RE210 would be nice, but they are unsupported by openwrt and most repeaters with lan port do not use the lan port for network uplink.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>regards, zoo</p>									</div>

					<p>Posting a reply because I&#039;m interesting in such a device as well. I have a cat6 cable between living room / router and one floor up, where wifi reception isn&#039;t great. Lots of rebar in the concrete, apparently.</p>									</div>

					<p>Terminology is a problem here.&nbsp; For most &quot;repeater&quot; means wireless, but what you also are saying is you want to use an Ethernet LAN connection.</p><p>So to be as clear as possible, if you want a second router hanging of your primary router connected by a cable on the same IP segment and want the primary device to server up your DHCP, then you want a Dumb AP.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58313">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58313</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a><br />It&#039;s basically disabling the DHCP on the AP.&nbsp; </p><p>If you want a device that is connected on a different IP segment then most devices should be able to do this out of the box.&nbsp; Just connect the primary routers LAN to the secondary devices WAN.&nbsp; </p><p>Any OpenWrt device should meet your needs.&nbsp; Its configuration. <br />Not a dual band device, but all the ports you may want, external antenna and comes with OpenWrt installed.<br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/product/gl-ar150-antenna-version/">http://www.gl-inet.com/product/gl-ar150 … a-version/</a><br />There is a POE version if your primary router will support that, otherwise a basic AC-5V charger will do.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for pointing me to the TP-Link TL-WR710N and the GL-AR150, maybe I am waiting for the TL-WR810N to be supported (300 Mbps, same design).</p>									</div>
