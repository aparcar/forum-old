					<p>HI folks,</p><p>I have 2 routers. One is a WRT54GS (we shall call it router1) and the other a WR54G (we shall call it router 2).</p><p>Router one has an internet connection and it also running an openvpn in client mode with redirect gateway on (So all traffic goes down the vpn tunnel). Router 1 is also running a wifidog gateway (But i don&#039;t think this is causing any problems)</p><p>I have set up a WDS between these 2 routers. Everything work sgreat until I try and use 2 devices connected to router 2.</p><p>Is just creates a huge bottle neck. If for example I run youtube on one laptop, then try and access a site using my ipod touch (or vice versa), the web is almost unuseable.</p><p>Doing the same thing when connected to router 1 everything is fine (So it&#039;s not the internet connection)</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Router 2 was orignally running dd-wrt with the same problems so I moved to openwrt but the same thing happens.</p><p>Both routers are currently running whiterunnian (router1 is RC6 and router 2 is 0.9 latest)</p><p>Cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jonnytabpni</strong> on 24 Apr 2009, 18:08)</p>
