					<p>Hi, I&#039;m working for a small WISP. <br />We&#039;re searching for a low cost router to use as wireless outdoor client and we are interested in opensorce solutions. </p><p>Now we have in test a WRT54GL. <br />Is it possible, after flashing openwrt to use it as wireless client instead of his default function of access point ? </p><p>If so, is then possible to make it doing nat with iptables beetwekn the LAN and the radio ( I mean unbridging the LAN from the radio) and maybe having some security inprovment (I was thinking to 802.1x/WPA, but also vpn would be nice ... ) </p><p>How harmful is flashing openwrt from the web UI without having boot_wait on ? (ping bug seems not to work on this device <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />) </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
