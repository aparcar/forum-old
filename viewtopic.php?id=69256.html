					<p>The exact firmware revision is usually printed on the bottom of your router, however in this particular case the firmware images for rev 2 and rev 3 are identical - so you can safely use either:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ wget -qO- https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr941nd-v2-squashfs-factory.bin | sha256sum -

I can also login into the router on 192.168.1.1 <br />with ssh.</p><p>But -&gt; i&#039;m not able to login with TELNET to enter a password. I also tried to enter failsafe boot, the device seems to go into that mode but i&#039;m than not geeting a response by bing to the router and telnet isn&#039;t therefore not possible.</p><p>I entered the failsafe mode by clicking the QS Button (also RESET Button) in the front oft the device after SYS comes up the first time. After that sys tries to blink very fast endless. I also tried a second advice from a user to wait with pushing the button until the device comes with one ping repsonse but it is also the same.</p><p>Now what can i do to set my password to have full access in ssh mode?</p><p>thx.</p>									</div>
