It most likely switches to the channel the 88W8887 senses has the least interference at the moment of switching.&nbsp; Without mwifiex-sdio-firmware installed on the 3200acm, it&#039;s channel switching behavior reverts to that of the 1200/1900 models (it will only switch to channel 36).&nbsp; </p><p>So the 3200acm doesn&#039;t have better/more accurate radar detection (well it does because it has the 88W8887, but it isn&#039;t currently being utilized); but it does have a working channel switching behavior when &quot;radar&quot; is detected.&nbsp; For accurate radar detection on the 3200acm, an algorithm is needed which monitors the current channel (if it is DFS) with the 88W8887 and listens for the specific patterns of interference which correspond to actual radar.&nbsp; Or, the algorithm may be built into the firmware of the 88W8887, but either a) we are missing an open-source DFS driver for the 88W8887 (remember kmod-mwifiex-sdio is an AP driver only) which doesn&#039;t exist yet or b) the firmware for the 88W8887 in the mwifiex-sdio-firmware package is out of date or c) both.</p><p>Anyone know if all routers which officially support DFS (the 1200/1900 models do not as mentioned before) incorrectly detect any interference as radar on LEDE/OpenWRT and quickly switch channels (within approx 30 minutes to a couple hours)?&nbsp; Or is it only the 3200acm?</p><br /><p>Lastly and un-related to the above, does LEDE/OpenWRT support MU-MIMO on the 3200acm?&nbsp; If so, does it work?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing no, and it will need to be added to the mwlwifi driver.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 9 Jul 2017, 06:44)</p>
