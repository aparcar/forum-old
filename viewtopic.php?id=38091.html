					<p>Hi guys!</p><p>I recently bought a Netgear N600 aka WNDR3800. According to this <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/benchmark.openssl</a> Wiki entry it is one of the fastest routers available for crypto stuff like aes-256-cbc. </p><p>In my tests around 6300k</p><p>But the VPN Performance with OpenVPN isn´t very satisfying I think. I just get around 900 kb/s through the Tunnel (with lzo, aes128-cbc and sha1) this seams very slow to me, shouldn´t the performance be much better? I mean my Intel Atom 330 has about 19000k and this is a 1.66 Ghz CPU. I thought the performance of the Atheros chips should be around 15 - 16 Mbit/s.</p><p>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;16 bytes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;64 bytes&nbsp; &nbsp; 256 bytes&nbsp; &nbsp;1024 bytes&nbsp; &nbsp;8192 bytes<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Atom 330&nbsp; &nbsp; aes-256 cbc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16348.71k&nbsp; &nbsp; 18387.86k&nbsp; &nbsp; 19032.58k&nbsp; &nbsp; 19202.39k&nbsp; &nbsp; 19248.47k<br />AR7161&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; aes-256 cbc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5829.32k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6223.84k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6296.83k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6393.08k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6331.05k</p><p>What is your experience with the VPN performance with the WNDR3800 or the AR7161 rev2 CPU?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Berndf</strong> on 16 Jul 2012, 02:42)</p>

					<p>are you really getting only 900kbit/s or do you get 900 kByte/s?</p><p>900 kByte/s are a realistic value. if you really get only 900kbit/s there is really a problem and you have to look into it. </p><p>if the 900kByte/s are to slow, you have a few options: </p><p>try it without lzo-compression</p><p>use another (faster) cipher e.g. blowfish<br />compile openwrt with optimizations for the cpu of your device (will get you +10% with aes)<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35323">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35323</a></p><p>or check this page<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.basics">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.basics</a></p><p>there are some openssl-optimizations (use be openvpn) but I think, they are already build in. </p><p>another chance would be to use IPsec. which will perform better, as it runs in kernelspace only, and there are some <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.basics#ipsec.tuning">tweaks</a> with great performance-improvements. <br />But it&#039;s IPsec, and it&#039;s really complicated compared to OpenVPN, and has some limitations.</p>									</div>

					<p>Software encryption with those cheap routers is always a pain. Just a simple comparison:</p><p>Atom 330 = 1 mb cache / 1.6 GHz / 64 Bit / 8 Watts for CPU only<br />AR7161 = 64K cache / 680 MHz / 32 Bit / 6 Watts for the whole router</p><p>Other aspects are:</p><p>Intel Atom offers more complex instructions than MIPS. <br />Arithmetic and load/store operations are combined. </p><p>The IPsec assembler optimizations from the wiki show the potential of these routers - but they show there limitations too.</p>									</div>
