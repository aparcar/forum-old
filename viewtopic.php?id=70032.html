					<p>Let&#039;s assume I have 3 zones: lan, wan and other. For -t filter -A FORWARD, LuCI creates iptables rules which roughly look like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-A delegate_forward -i lanif -j zone_lan_forward
-A delegate_forward -i wanif -j zone_wan_forward
-A delegate_forward -i otherif -j zone_other_forward
-A delegate_forward -j GLOBAL_POLICY</code></pre></div><p>...with each -A zone_..._forward being like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-A zone_x_forward -j zone_x_dest_POLICY</code></pre></div><p><strong>POLICY</strong> corresponds to the value of the Format option in the LuCI for the corresponding zone (<strong>x</strong>).</p><p>zone_x_dest_POLICY itself looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-A zone_x_dest_POLICY -o xif -j POLICY</code></pre></div><p>So if we merge all this we get essentially these rules:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-A delegate_forward -i lanif -o lanif -j POLICY_for_lan
-A delegate_forward -i wanif -o wanif -j POLICY_for_wan
-A delegate_forward -i otherif -o otherif -j POLICY_for_other
-A delegate_forward -j GLOBAL_POLICY</code></pre></div><p><strong>The question is:</strong> does zone policy affect anything? Can there be a packet that is forwarded from a given interface to the same interface? My understanding is that iptables forwarding always have different input/output interfaces but these rules have -i = -o so they must never match. </p><p>(This is what the wiki suggests too: &quot;FORWARD rules for a zone describe what happens to traffic passing <strong>between different interfaces</strong> in that zone.&quot;. <em>wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</em>)</p><p>If I am correct then it means the zone&#039;s policy will never be applied and the global policy will be in effect instead. I think zone_x_forward is supposed to never return but if its final -j zone_x_dest_POLICY doesn&#039;t match then zone_x_forward returns (since it&#039;s a user chain) and GLOBAL_POLICY is used instead. This may well be undesired. </p><p>Should I post this to the bug tracker?</p><p>CHAOS CALMER (15.05, r46767)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hofferen</strong> on 27 Feb 2017, 17:56)</p>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>hofferen wrote:</cite><blockquote><p><strong>The question is:</strong> does zone policy affect anything? Can there be a packet that is forwarded from a given interface to the same interface?</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes, it does. Yes, it can. That will happen if a host in LAN has the router&#039;s IP addr set as default gateway but is assuming a wrong netmask and is trying to talk to someone that is on the same link, bouncing through the router. Unusual, but it can happen and the router will likely issue icmp redirect messages to tell the sender that the destination has a direct route on the link. </p><p>Routing from and to the same iface will also happen in NAT loopback connections. IPv6 configuration by the way has many odd possibilities, including clearing a flag in Router Advertisement messages that will tell every host on LAN to always talk to other hosts through the router, even if they are physically on the same link.</p><p>But the most frequent scenario where you will be forwarding from and to the same ZONE is when this zone has multiple associated interfaces (e.g. you could have several LAN segments segregated by VLAN configs but associated to the same zone named LAN and you want to allow routing between them, so LAN zone to LAN zone forwarding is what you need).</p><p>In my understanding, the general policy setting is applied to ifaces that have not been declared in /etc/config/network. For instance, you may have installed some VPN program that created a tun0 iface but tun0 is not explicitly linked to any virtual interface in OpenWrt and consequently will not be linked to any zone name. In this case, the general policy setting will be applied.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndreL</strong> on 28 Feb 2017, 00:06)</p>

					<p><strong>AndreL</strong>, thanks for the examines. I&#039;d say they are all exotic (except maybe for the LAN segments). UCI&#039;s firewall framework is supposed to suit most common use cases (think I&#039;ve read this on the wiki). And for such cases current behaviour is counter-intuitive because as you say:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>In my understanding, the general policy setting is applied to ifaces that have not been declared in /etc/config/network.</p></blockquote></div><p>Exactly, and that&#039;s how it doesn&#039;t work right now - last rule in the zone chain is only applied in those specific cases you have given examines of, and not applied in most other, common cases (because typically in/out interfaces are different) falling through to the remainder of delegate_... rules.</p>									</div>

However, it doesn&#039;t entirely fix the problem since a zone&#039;s forward policy won&#039;t be applied in all cases (it will be applied only in rare cases). So in addition to enforcing global forward&#039;s policy (or at least hiding from the LuUI or showing a warning liking to this thread) I suggest fixing each zone&#039;s forward&#039;s chain catch-all rule (zone_x_<strong>src</strong>_POLICY instead of zone_x_dest_POLICY) to make it really catch-all.</p><p>Also, it&#039;s unclear why forwarding works without explicit <em>config forwarding</em> entry (simply enabling conntrack is enough). I haven&#039;t dug into it but perhaps there&#039;s another bug. Or is it intended behaviour?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hofferen</strong> on 28 Feb 2017, 09:53)</p>
