I did restore the WAN settings to defaults just so I would know that I was making use of the latest settings. Working really well so far. Yes I did do a reboot to clear things out.&nbsp; So glad to have LEDE running the way I think it should. Very fast and reliable. Always has been my go to except for when I started having lookup issues. Not sure why this suddenly became an issue as I have been doing the same setting for quite a few releases back and with driver changes I tend to do a new configuration just in case there is something new that an old backup might mess up.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 7 Aug 2017, 21:45)</p>

I can ping google.com by name and IP address without issue. Am using Level 3 DNS servers 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.4 in the DNS/DHCP config without DNS servers defined anyplace else. I can also do opkg update without issues. Updates just fine. Not sure where your issues are. Maybe re-read what starcms suggested and check your LEDE config or worst case start over with a clean config.</p><p>Update<br />Just a thought, I rebooted after the changes. Did you?

Then started getting DNS timeouts with more recent builds which chased me over to DD-WRT as I did not have the issues there. @Starcms suggested, at first, to set on WAN rather then LAN. This took care of the DNS timeouts for me. He later suggested the settings on DNS/DHCP in Luci, which controls config of dnsmasq service. This sets things so only the wanted DNS servers are queried if done as he directed. As I understand things now, before the ISP DNS servers may still be queried as well as the defined ones. As I recall I saw this in the resolv.conf file, both defined and ISP servers listed. Since making the last change I have not had any slowdowns/timeouts.&nbsp; </p><p>Of course this all assumes you are wanting to use certain DNS servers and not just the default ISP DNS servers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 8 Aug 2017, 21:22)</p>

					<p>I am facing issues with the latest David&#039;s built.<br />It is like it doesn&#039;t boot completely.<br />Some commands i have inside rc.local are not executed, and i cannot perform a reboot neither from command line, nor from Luci (it just refreshes the page when i hit reboot).<br />I checked the logs, but i didn&#039;t see something relevant there.<br />Tried a couple of times to re-flash it, but the problem remained.<br />Any idea what can cause it?</p>									</div>

     # start dnscrypt-proxy from procd interface trigger rather than immediately in init
     # if needed you can restrict trigger to certain interface(s)
     # list procd_trigger &#039;wan&#039;
     # list procd_trigger &#039;wan6&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Once you decide to upgrade to 1.9.5-5 (or newer) manually, or you upgrade to @david&#039;s next build (which is better than upgrading it manually, because if you upgrade manually you lose plugin support), be sure to uncomment (at least) the <em>config global</em> line and I would recommend uncommenting the <em>list procd_trigger &#039;wan&#039;</em> line.&nbsp; This only affects those that use dnscrypt and always save and restore their settings.</p><p>1.9.5-5 is meant to fix any remaining timing issues; although I have never encountered any, and 1.9.5-6 is a quick patch to fix a bug causing log spam in 1.9.5-5.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 9 Aug 2017, 07:34)</p>

First thing I did was I set the DNS settings as per @starcms instructions. Put custom DNS in DNS forwardings of DHCP and DNS settings, and checked the box for ignore resolve file and everything worked as advertised. So appears you are correct sir&#039;s.</p><p>Now If one of you could maybe help me further troubleshoot? I continued my setup for the rest of the router and what do you know I get the same problem as before after installing and setting up openvpn-policy-routing package. again unchecking the checkbox for ignore resolve file fixes it. I have done a check for any DNS leaks after unchecking ignore resolve file and it appears that DNS is not going through the ISP DNS server. So do either of you have any insight that could maybe help me out?</p><p>NOTE 1: I noticed that before checking the box for ignore resolve file that the line below it &quot;Resolve file&quot; was populated with one of the /tmp/resolv.conf files. After unchecking ignore resolve file again the line &quot;Resolve file&quot; no longer was populated with the /tmp/resolv.conf file it is just blank now. So maybe just deleting this line has the same effect as checking the box?</p><p>NOTE 2: I did reboot the router after changing any of the settings just to be sure.</p><p>Thanks for all your help fellas, I really appreciate it!</p>									</div>
