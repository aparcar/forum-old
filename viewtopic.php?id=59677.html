					<p>Hi there.</p><p> I have been running OpenWRT on a multitude of devices for years,<br />and have had previously versions running as a guest under KVM hosted by ProxmoxVE3.2</p><p>Now that I have upgraded to ProxmoxVE4 (based on Debian Jessie 8.1)<br />and Chaos Calmer is released I decided to test them out together.</p><p>The process for doing this has always been extremely simple:<br /> see &quot;proxmox or kvm - openwrt&quot;<br /><a href="http://forum.proxmox.com/threads/2348-proxmox-or-kvm-openwrt-xwrt-install">http://forum.proxmox.com/threads/2348-p … rt-install</a></p><p>I have created 2 VMs using<br /> openenwrt-15.05-x86-64-combined-ext4.img.gz<br />and <br />openwrt-15.05-x86-kvm_guest-combined-ext4.img.gz&nbsp; </p><p>and both show the same behavior.<br />( I prefer the x86-64 because it recognises intel e1000 ethernet device)</p><p>My spice Remote Desktop window shows the console output- <br />as prompted I can [Please press enter to activate this console ] :-)</p><p>I can ping and nmap&nbsp; the IPs over my 2&nbsp; LANs<br />eth0 slaved to br0 is 192.168.1.1<br />eth1 has DHCPd to 192.168.5.133</p><p>[root@k8 yum]# nmap -T4&nbsp; 192.168.1.1</p><p>Starting Nmap 6.47 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2015-09-16 17:54 BST<br />Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1<br />Host is up (0.00029s latency).<br />All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.1.1 are filtered<br />MAC Address: E2:24:E5:90:FA:A0 (Unknown)</p><p>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 21.22 seconds<br />[root@k8 yum]# </p><p>However I cannot see any open ports.<br />i.e. no SSH server and no LUCI<br />although ps shows dropbear and telnetd are running.</p><p>Can anybody help me with suggestions for how to proceed?</p><p>I was aware that _trunk_ builds don&#039;t have LUCI, but am happy enough to install it manually, if only I could ssh in.</p><p>I have searched the forums, wiki help and Google, so now my last resort is to ask here.</p><p>Thankyou all in advance<br />;-)</p><p>[edit]: in case it matters here are the URLs for the builds I used:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/x86/kvm_guest/openwrt-15.05-x86-kvm_guest-combined-ext4.img.gz">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm … xt4.img.gz</a></p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/x86/64/openwrt-15.05-x86-64-combined-ext4.img.gz">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm … xt4.img.gz</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>E39@sco.eu</strong> on 17 Sep 2015, 15:59)</p>

					<p>maybe it helps..</p><p>maybe you misconfigured..<br />had a similar problem but i only used only 1 NIC so owrt got only lan side and i had to make lan side as a dhcp client and disable dhcp server for lan side and also enable forwarding for lan interface<br />so considering this configuration the vm owrt machine take an ip from my real router so i can ping/stuff </p><p>considering your config; whats your router(if you have one) internal ip? maybe it conflicts with vm lan ip.. <br />or you have to make a static connection to 192.168.1.X subnet..</p>									</div>

					<p>@makarel<br />Thankyou for your helpful reply. :-)</p><p>After considering your suggestions, I was able to get it working<br />by changing the LAN ip. :-)<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>makarel wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>considering your config; whats your router(if you have one) internal ip? maybe it conflicts with vm lan ip.. <br />or you have to make a static connection to 192.168.1.X subnet..</p></blockquote></div><p>I used &#039;opkg install nano&#039; (and update luci and luci-ssl)</p><p>then using nano to edit /etc/config/network <br /> changed the default ip from 192.168.1.1</p><p>and restarted networking with<br />/etc/init.d/network reload</p><p>[root@k8 yum]# nmap -T4 192.168.11.254<br />Starting Nmap 6.47 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2015-09-17 13:25 BST<br />Nmap scan report for 192.168.11.254<br />Host is up (0.00032s latency).<br />Not shown: 995 closed ports<br />PORT&nbsp; &nbsp; STATE SERVICE<br />22/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; ssh<br />23/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; telnet<br />53/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; domain<br />80/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; http<br />443/tcp open&nbsp; https<br />MAC Address: E2:24:E5:90:FA:A0 (Unknown)</p><p>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 38.26 seconds<br />[root@k8 yum]#</p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to wholeheartidly recommend using ProxmoxVE to host OpenWRT Virtual Machines.</p><p>Proxmox Virtual Environment is a fully open source platform which is very easy to install and manage.<br />e.g. experimenting with all sorts of network configurations is possible, indeed very easy, because Proxmox allows setting up all VM guest networking using a browser based user interface to administer Software Defined Networking.</p><p>Plus you get an interactive console in a Remote Viewer window on your desktop - no more fiddling about with serial ports! ;-)</p><p>All the advantages of flexibility without the risks that usually come with flashing real hardware devices. :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>E39@sco.eu</strong> on 17 Sep 2015, 16:17)</p>
