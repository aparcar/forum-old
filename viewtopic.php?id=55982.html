					<p>The reason OpenWrt does use tmpfs (RAM) for log files is because onboard flash is more valuable than some<br />external attached log storage.<br />Logging to a remote server or a USB/GPIO attached (exchangable) storage are solutions too.</p><p>However - you can check the Data Sheet of the flash used in your router. These datasheets should be available on Manufacturer or some reseller sites for popular chips.</p><p>the popular M25P80 lists in &quot;Table 11: Data Retention and Endurance&quot;:<br />Min. 100,000 Program/Erase cycles per block.<br />Data Retention of Min. 20 years.</p><p>So even if you overwrite the same blocks with log data ALL of these block might (!) turn bad after 11 years if you write every hour (1 year=8760 hours).<br />(<a href="http://www.micron.com/~/media/documents/products/data-sheet/nor-flash/serial-nor/m25p/m25p80.pdf">data sheet m25p80</a>)</p><p>Your Flash question will expand to <br />- how much do you trust the manufacturing quality of the whole router (soldering all other chips), environment (near lightning strikes, extreme temperatures) to last ~11 years ?<br />- if your log is &quot;critical&quot; what is your plan regarding other hardware faults that tend to occur more often (ageing:&nbsp; soldering, electricity: capacitator quality / voltage quality)</p><p>Notice that NAND flash is far more likely to go bad - even from reading - than commonly used NOR flash.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see, indeed I intended to write to USB or alike, but my router do not have one, I am using <strong>msmtp</strong> to send the logs when it accumulates certain size, but I can not trust <strong>/tmp</strong> you know.</p><p>Well, if I understood you, there is no problem to write this frequency, even though it is not a good practice, I do not think I will remain the same router for 11 years...</p><p>I believe <a href="http://pastebin.com/vhRTrayj">WR841ND</a> uses NOR flash.</p><p>Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shinobi</strong> on 26 Feb 2015, 15:53)</p>

					<p>You could lessen write-stress to the flash memory by storing your data on /tmp (once per hour), and periodically save the data to flash (once every 2...3...4 hours).</p><p>Depending on the kind of data to be stored, a data loss of 2...3...4 hours might be acceptable - or not.</p><p>I&#039;m using this method for storing weather data every minute into a rrd on /tmp, and every 30min save the data to flash / USB memory, depending on whats available.</p>									</div>

					<p>You will see my plans in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55927">this topic</a> which I have <a href="http://pastebin.com/i2bKCmUf">this code</a> (remember to put <strong>iptables -N BWTRAFF</strong> on <strong>/etc/firewall.user</strong>), indeed it runs every 5 seconds and records on <strong>/tmp</strong> directory, but every hour it assimilates the main measures and records on <strong>/etc/traff</strong>.</p><p>On DD-WRT it was a pain in the neck because I had only 64kb available memory, and <strong>nvram commit</strong> runs at midnight. With OpenWRT I do not have problems with synchronization, but I was concerned about this flash memory issue would put me in trouble in a near future.</p><p>I am considering to change the code to record every hour on <strong>/tmp</strong> too, and do another routine to copy it to NOR memory every 6 hours for instance. Do you think would it be the better alternative?</p>									</div>
