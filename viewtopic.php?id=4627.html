					<p>You can get most sources for binary packages from <a href="http://www2.wpkg.org/openwrt/SOURCES">http://www2.wpkg.org/openwrt/SOURCES</a></p><p>If there are no sources for some packages (i.e. gcc or glibc-devel) it means they were built using buildroot etc.</p><p>You will also find configure* files, with build options and sometimes comments on what to change in the sources for a successful compilation.</p>									</div>
