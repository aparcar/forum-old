					<p>I have setup gpio0 and gpio1 on my RSPro to be input pins and have tested that I am able to read from /sys/class/gpio/gpio[03]/value appropriately.</p><p>Based on <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/gpio.txt;hb=HEAD">http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/g â€¦ xt;hb=HEAD</a> I then tried to setup edge triggers for the falling edges:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo falling &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio0/edge
cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio0/edge
falling</code></pre></div><p>And then with the pins held high I ran a test program that that did select() on the two value files followed by read() on the returned file descriptors.&nbsp; Also tried poll() instead of select().&nbsp; When I spat out the values it was just a stream of 1s as though there is no blocking:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
Pin0: 0
Pin1: 0
Pin0: 0
Pin1: 0
...</code></pre></div><p>According to sysfs docs, if &#039;edge&#039; exists setting it should block poll() and read() accordingly:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>/sys/class/gpio/gpioN/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;value&quot; ... reads as either 0 (low) or 1 (high).&nbsp; If the GPIO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is configured as an output, this value may be written;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any nonzero value is treated as high.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the pin can be configured as interrupt-generating interrupt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and if it has been configured to generate interrupts (see the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; description of &quot;edge&quot;), you can poll(2) on that file and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poll(2) will return whenever the interrupt was triggered. If<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you use poll(2), set the events POLLPRI and POLLERR. If you<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; use select(2), set the file descriptor in exceptfds. After<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poll(2) returns, either lseek(2) to the beginning of the sysfs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file and read the new value or close the file and re-open it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to read the value.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;edge&quot; ... reads as either &quot;none&quot;, &quot;rising&quot;, &quot;falling&quot;, or<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;both&quot;. Write these strings to select the signal edge(s)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that will make poll(2) on the &quot;value&quot; file return.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This file exists only if the pin can be configured as an<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interrupt generating input pin.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Odemia</strong> on 21 Dec 2011, 19:09)</p>

					<p>Did some more investigating and discovered that the values I was actually getting out were:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>49    # &quot;1&quot;
10    # &quot;LF&quot;
0      # &quot;NUL&quot;
0
...</code></pre></div><p>So I get that the first 2 values have to be read, but why won&#039;t it then block?</p>									</div>
