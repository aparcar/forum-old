					<p>Hi guys! Can you help me? please <br />I have a Comtrend router:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Branded : Jazztel (Spain brand)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Model&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: Comtrend CT-5361<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SoC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: Broadcom 6348<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CPU speed : 256MHz <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ram&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 16MiB<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flash&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 4MiB<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4x ethernet port, 1x line port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;USB port : No</p><p>I would mount openwrt for download with amule, using NFS, on a hard disk connected on the router/modem Netgear DGN2200. The comtrend will be connected to the netgear (modem adsl) by lan.<br />I don&#039;t know if i have enough space. I can make a partition on the same hard disk for the swap. Which firmware should I use? Probably a jffs2 image is better than a squashfs. What do you think about? Is it possible? How can i save the space?<br />Thank you so much.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>valk791</strong> on 4 Aug 2012, 20:36)</p>
