					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to add an extra PPPoE interface (using <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</a> as a guide)&nbsp; on my already installed and setup OpenWRT router (a Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H), without much success. Right now the router already has a WAN interface and everything is working perfectly, but adding the extra PPPoE interface and attempting to bring it up immediately makes it impossible to reach my router via wired LAN (wireless still works). This is my current network config, which works alright as long as I don&#039;t bring up the PPPoE interface:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>Thanks for the links, though I&#039;m having a hard time following what is said in the links (bit of an OpenWrt newbie still) - is there anything specific I can do to make make my setup work or is what I am trying to do only supported in the latest from trunk?</p>									</div>

					<p>Obviously you can&#039;t have eth0 in two interfaces. What you need to do is create two vlans, eth0.1 and eth0.2, and assign the other vlan to lan and the other vlan to xs4all.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>Thanks! I guess that actually does make sense, I was trying to replicate the setup from the Gentoo box that is currently doing the PPPoE link (until I get it working on OpenWrt), and on there it doesn&#039;t seem to use vlans or aliases and just wants me to specify &#039;link_ppp0=&quot;eth0&quot;&#039; in the network config, but I guess under the hood that does something else. I&#039;ll give this a try later tonight</p>									</div>
