					<p>Hi all, </p><p>I managed to get my DIR-825 B1 2.06NA flashed. i did not have to use windows or IE or wine. I simply used Debian linux and midori browser. I set static IP of 192.168.0.1/24 and it flashed fine. I used recovery mode and did it natively in linux. </p><p>However now that I am up an running I have been configuring and doing package management. However installing packages and then removing them dose not give back the free space. I installed luci-app-openvn (which also installs openvpn) and then removed it. Before the install I had 82% space free, after I removed the same software I have only 13%! </p><p>I would really appreciate some help on this. my df- h outputs this</p><p>/dev/root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.9M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.9M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /rom<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30.2M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28.7M&nbsp; &nbsp;5% /tmp<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; 512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp;0% /dev<br />/dev/mtdblock4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; 572.0K&nbsp; 82% /overlay<br />mini_fo:/overlay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.9M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.9M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /</p><p>I see that overlay must be the cause. I though the downloaded opkg files might be the culprit but I cannot figure out how to clear cache. In debian I would use apt-get autoclean. </p><p>Also I know that openvpn has left some directories and files kicking around is there anyway to purge all this without reflashing?</p><p>Thanks again<br />Chris</p>									</div>
