					<p>Isn&#039;t the DD/trunk very unstable? I need something stable and CC 15.05 seems to do the trick, except for wireless that is.</p><p>So the problem is with CC and not the wifi drivers? If the problem is with the drivers, can I use RC3 and use the latest mwlwifi drivers with it to get rid of the decreasing performance issue?&nbsp; Or are the newest mwlwifi drivers not compatible with CC 15.05 RC3?</p><p>Any recommended builds that are stable and fixes this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Some people are doing CC builds with different versions of mwlwifi. I don&#039;t know if you could opkg force the driver from a different build or not, or get your hands on one of those CC builds. I use my own DD build and find it stable, certainly have not had any unanticipated outages. Can&#039;t speak to the trunk build.

					<p>Ok. I&#039;ll look around and test a couple of other builds. If I can&#039;t find any stable one then I think I will try to live with the stock one until a more stable build is available. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>									</div>

					<p>According to the gigantic thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50173,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50173,</a> to spare some reading, <br />CC stable has a terrible WIFI driver.<br />Latest trunk is reported to work very well. It&#039;s very stable on my WRT1200, and a lot more than CC.<br />Give it a try. Be sure to install luci manually (opkg update ; opkg install luci).</p>									</div>
