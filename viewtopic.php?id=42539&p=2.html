Probably I will try snapshot next time I catch problem. For now uptime is 1d 10h and I was able to transfer about ~30-40Gb without problems. Any way 1043 behave much better than with stock firmware as with stock it hangs without any chances to reconnect to wifi untill restart with poweroff.</p>									</div>
