					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve succeeded in having 8 different bssids on a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND (atheros chipset AR9103)<br />If I try more than 8, I get this:</p><p>Configuration file: h.conf<br />rfkill: Cannot open RFKILL control device<br />Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:30 and ssid &quot;free_0&quot;<br />Using interface wlan0-1 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:31 and ssid &quot;free_1&quot;<br />Using interface wlan0-2 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:32 and ssid &quot;free_2&quot;<br />Using interface wlan0-3 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:33 and ssid &quot;free_3&quot;<br />Using interface wlan0-4 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:34 and ssid &quot;free_4&quot;<br />Using interface wlan0-5 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:35 and ssid &quot;free_5&quot;<br />Using interface wlan0-6 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:36 and ssid &quot;free_6&quot;<br />Using interface wlan0-7 with hwaddr a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:37 and ssid &quot;free_7&quot;<br />Could not set interface wlan0-8 flags (UP): Device or resource busy<br />Failed to add BSS (BSSID=a2:f3:c1:3c:eb:38)<br />wlan0: Unable to setup interface.</p><br /><p>My question is, why 8 and not 9 or 10 or 30?<br />Is this limitation a hardware or driver one?</p><p>thanks,</p><p>Y</p>									</div>
