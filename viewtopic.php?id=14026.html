					<p>Hi,</p><p>I already asked the following in the WhiteRussion forum (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=61160#p61160">2008-01-02 23:44:38</a>), however, did no get an answer. Maybe WhiteRussion is definitely no longer the platform to go for this purpose? Any help is highly appreciated.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I would like to connect a huge external USB HD to my OpenWRT and use it as a DAAP server for iTunes. I am actually quite new to all this media server stuff so I do not know exactly where to start. What I have figured out is that there is a server called &quot;mt-daap&quot;, which apparently has been renamed to &quot;firefly&quot; for newer versions. I searched the forums and the web for the terms {OpenWRT, mt-daap, firefly, iTunes} in various combinations, but have not found much. Apparently there was a mt-daap port by nico (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=22398#p22398">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=22398#p22398</a>), but it seems to be no longer available. Overall, the number of hits on my queries where surprisingly low, so I am wondering if I am actually searching for the right things. </p><p>Maybe somebody here could help me:</p><p>- is it feasible at all to use my OpenWRT box for media sharing (no conversions)? I have a quite big library (~100GB)...</p><p>- is mt-daap the thing to look for?</p><p>- and if it is, where can I find it?</p></blockquote></div><p>I am currently running WhiteRussion RC2. Yes, this is pretty old , however, has been running perfectly for years. I just never found a good reason to replace it with some newer version. Of course I would be willing to update to Kamikaze if necessary - using my router as an iTunes server <em> would </em> be a good reason <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks a lot!</p><p>Daniel</p>									</div>

My router gets rebooted all the time (it is frequently turned off and on).
