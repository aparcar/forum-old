					<p>Hi,</p><p>today I received 2 routers I ordered.<br />Both are TP-Links WR941N wireless routers.<br />Thing is that I didnt use wireless for some time<br />and I didnt check for wireless modes supported<br />by these routers. Since I need them to connect<br />two places I need them to work in bridge or<br />repeater mode (cant remmeber the correct one).<br />Anyways, problem is that none of these mods<br />are supported by these routers. Searching for<br />whole day gave me no results. Now, my question<br />is can OpenWRT be installed on them to enable<br />such functions ? I dont know anything about<br />OpenWRT but I&#039;m a linux power user so I dont<br />think it will be a problem to get used to it if<br />pointed in right direction.</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mad_max0204</strong> on 31 Oct 2009, 22:47)</p>
