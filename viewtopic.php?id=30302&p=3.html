					<p>Hi ejurgensen and others,</p><p>I have put the sources of my (command line) player on GitHub. You can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/ErikOnBike/light-play">https://github.com/ErikOnBike/light-play</a></p><p>The player can only play ALAC files to Airport Express devices right now. I might add AirPlay support in the future (ie stream AAC audio-files to more modern AirPort express devices or AppleTV devices).</p><p>The player is very low on resource usage. It does not perform any music transcoding (streams directly from the m4a-file) and no encryption (ignores all optional Airport Express authentication stuff). Passwords on the Airport Express Music streaming is supported.</p><p>The player is developed and will compile on a Mac (with Xcode command line tools or MacPorts). It compiles on OpenWrt and uses around 1% CPU on my WNDR3700.</p><p>The coming time I will try to turn the player into a little server with a web frontend. Afterwards I might try and add AirPlay support. Since I do not have an AppleTV, this is less priority. It requires some rewrite of the network code (since AirPlay is UDP based and requires more timing stuff to be handled). Difficult to test without a real device ;-).</p><p>Cheers,<br />Erik</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re welcome! Remember, that what you are doing is crosscompiling, so installing stuff with apt-get is not going to do any good unless it is some tool used only during the compilation (like git, antlr3 and so on). If you want libplist you must install it as a feed, so use &quot;scripts/feeds install libplist&quot;. You may also need to select the package during make menuconfig.</p><p>Libplist is actually only necessary because --enable-itunes is selected.

					<p>I don&#039;t have a good idea about what might be going wrong for you, unfortunately. I can see program execution is failing very early in the start up sequence, and as you can see it is happening while it is registering with Avahi. There is only one function being executed in this step, avahi_client_new(). Apparently this function is segfaulting for you.</p><p>So one thing to check is your version of libavahi, libavahi-client and libavahi-dbus-support. What version are they? They should be 0.6.31-5 (you can check with opkg list-installed | grep libavahi). Maybe also try reinstalling the libavahi libs?</p><p>If that is alright you might need to use a debugger. I have never had much luck with gdb, but Valgrind is sometimes helpful (but will be very slow on your tplink).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ejurgensen</strong> on 17 Apr 2014, 00:20)</p>

					<p>Yes, I fixed the embedded artwork issue a while ago. I forgot to put a notice up about it. The only progress on the AAC problem is that I&#039;ve found out that ffmpeg&#039;s transcoding is causing it. Maybe a newer version of ffmpeg has some optimizations, or maybe there is some ffmpeg compile option which will fix it. Other solutions would be to use another library for decoding, or to not transcode when not required (like discussed above).</p><p>About AA vs BB, I think it comes down to ffmpeg as well. BB has ffmpeg 0.11.5, while AA has ffmpeg 0.8. Both should work, but ffmpeg 0.11.5 is required for forked-daapd to be able to extract embedded artwork.</p>									</div>

I imagine you&#039;ll create an install package for the golden release of BB? May just hold off until then since it&#039;s likely around the corner. Or do you suppose your current build would work with RC1 (based off of trunk r41580)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>onlinespending</strong> on 31 Jul 2014, 21:22)</p>

					<p>I don’t know if the current build will work with RC1, but when BB comes out I’ll make sure to upload a binary for ar71xx and brcm47xx. Looks like they are already at RC2 now, so maybe it will be soon.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have no objections, I can only applaud the work you are doing!</p><p>There seems to be a bug in version ffmpeg 2.1.1 (see <a href="https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd/issues/45),">https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd/issues/45),</a> which can cause segfaults, so I suggest a newer version than that.</p><p>Apart from that, forked-daapd should work with all versions of both libav and ffmpeg.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, one thing I&#039;d like to ask: Please configure with --enable-avresample. They moved the resampling stuff from avcodec to avresample, but for some reason they did not set libavresample to be built by default.</p>									</div>
