					<p>Suppose I put OpenWRT on a Raspberry Pi. Suppose further that the RPI (or Banana Pi) has an ethernet port eth0 and has a USB to ethernet adapter as a second ethernet port eth1. I want to connect this device between my modem and my router, so that my WAN link from my modem gets connected to one of the ethernet ports and the other ethernet port goes to my router. The reason I would want to do this is to run intrusion prevention software on the device. Is this a situation where a simple ethernet bridge setup is what I need? How exactly would I do this? Does my RPI device in this situation even have an IP address, or is it basically just a dumb switch that passes all ethernet traffic? Any suggestions on how to set this up?</p>									</div>

					<p>Why wouldn&#039;t you either A) just run openWRT on the router and do things there or B) run the Pi as a router and do your stuff there. If your router has Wifi then you can still run the Pi as the router and let the router just be a wireless AP.</p>									</div>

I am not doing this to solve a particular problem just on my network. I am trying to come up with a simple plug-and-play approach where someone can just install a box between their modem and router and have it work without having to know how to go into their router an tweak things, and without having to go into this new box (say the RPI) and set that as the router.</p><p>So, under the assumption that I have very good reasons for doing it exactly this way, how would I go about making it happen? Would I have to configure iptables somehow?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want to be able to block/intercept packets, then you have to configure the Pi as a router. Otherwise you can set it up to bridge the packets and you&#039;ll be able to inspect them, but by the very nature of bridging you won&#039;t be able to prevent them from being passed along to the real router, especially using something like IP tables (bridging happens at layer 2 (MAC addresss/etc), IP tables for the most part operates on Layer 3 and above (IP addresses etc)). In theory if you use ebtables you could, but that&#039;s going to be far too low level to do what you want...</p><p>Having said that, you are not going to replace the end router. You&#039;re just sort of wedging another router in between the existing one and the modem. Set it up to DMZ all traffic from the modem interface to the interface connected to the existing router and then filter your packets in IP tables accordingly.</p><p>One caveat to keep in mind is that this will only work for IP routing. If, for example, you have somebody running the modem in bridge mode and their router is doing PPPoE then your stuck as your device will not be able to operate as an inbetween.</p>									</div>

If you actually get access to the raw packets you can easily deal with the PPPoE encapsulation by hand, this is not rocket science. I doubt that drbakpak should go that route though, given his (current) rudimentary understanding of the network stack.&nbsp; I am sure with a bit of research he will be able to set up SNORT on the pi (and most likely discover it to be too slow <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> )</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moeller0</strong> on 26 Feb 2015, 14:06)</p>
