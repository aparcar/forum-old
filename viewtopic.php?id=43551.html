					<p>I had a hunt around.</p><p>I guess my first question is what simple usb-&gt;audio jack out is &quot;good enough&quot; for internet radio. I want it small and cheap!</p><p>Second, software: madplay? If the station is streaming (I assume).</p><p>Third, I&#039;m thinking of creating a stand-alone radio with preset stations (weblink defined) but with gpios to hardware buttons. I think I can generate a script to respond to button pressed and switch the stream....<br />Actually, I am not sure about the stream thing and switching.<br />If madplay is the way to go, then I presumably send a stop and then restart with the new url.</p><p>Thanks for any input you guys can give</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />Are you sure about the way of controlling the router? I use the out-of-the-box running web server that Openwrt brings with it and made some ash/cgi scripts that produces links and buttons to control mpd. I then access them through my mobile browser. So I can listen to mp3, flac and aac streams and music shared through Samba (even grep albums in this Samba share).<br />I also made an extremely simple IR receiver circuit (connected to the Mic input of the soundcard) and use LIRC&nbsp; and a spare remote control, and this works great.<br />I dont know about the space required to store all that as I also use Samba to store the mpd package and LIRC.</p>									</div>
