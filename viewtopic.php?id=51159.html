					<p>Thank you for being patient with me ;-)</p><p>Yes, TL-WA850RE only has one Ethernet port, so I&#039;m using LAN as WAN interface and would like to connect via Wifi with Mikrotik (local LAN) (I guess WDS would be best, so far I don&#039;t know if Mikrotik works as AP WDS (both AP and WDS, I need to check it ,side comment - I&#039;m kind of surprised I was able to set it (AP WDS) up on another more cheaper devices running with Openwrt, I must be missing something...).</p><p>As for that, I will post configuration of TL-WA850RE (/etc/config/network and /etc/config/firewall) later today (after I bring it again to life), I would like to have it basically more as kind of repeater (kind of invisible network device) from packet perspective - with other words, TL-WA850RE should be able to forward everything to Mikrotik and vice-versa (so I would not need to setup port forwarding etc.), but would be great still to be able to upgrade eg.

					<p>If you want the TL-WA850RE to be a transparent bridge you will need proper 4-address mode on the wireless bridge (i.e. WDS) but in order to still be able to access it you will want to create a second wireless interface and give it a local IP on said interface, bridging that back to the MikroTik.</p>									</div>

					<p>@nebbia88, what do you mean please ? It doesn&#039;t work at all or WDS don&#039;t work between OpenWRT / TL-WA850RE and Mikrotik 951G-2HnD ?</p><p>@qasdfdsaq, you idea about another virtual SSID was very helpful, thank you. Currently I have following setup, it looks like when connected on SSID &quot;apwds&quot;, it&#039;s granting IP address to connected client from provider, which might be a solution for me (didn&#039;t test yet, as I can&#039;t bring internet down now ;-( ). When connected on SSID &quot;aptpconf&quot;, it assigns internal IP and LUCI stays accessible. Not sure how something like that is good from overall throughput point of view, but I do not need more then 20MBit currently. I&#039;m wondering whether I even need WDS now in such case...</p><p>** configs deleted, they are not current and might be misleading **</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sharkys</strong> on 19 Jun 2014, 22:04)</p>

					<p>So I&#039;m currently in the situation, where Mikrotik WLAN gets IP from the WA850RE from the provider (as the MAC is cloned), Mikrotik itself recognize connection to internet, but - any LAN client is not connected to the internet and VirtualAP (eg. like AP) don&#039;t work, when WLAN is already in STATION mode.<br />Really I would appreciate some support here. ;-(<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I find it quite often works between different brands, when encryption is off. There is also a standardised 802.11s option. However in this case we are looking at the *same* brand and chipset, just a different Linux distribution.</p><p>IIRC some Mikrotik boards can also run Openwrt. However in this case it might be better to swap them around, by using the Mikrotik as the ISP end AP and Openwrt as the repeater.</p>									</div>
