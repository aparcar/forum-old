					<p>My network setup is as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ISP (DHCP) --- Router (WNDR3700) --- Switch (TL-WR1043ND) ---- HTPC
                                                         |____ DVR (needs WAN IP)</code></pre></div><p>There is only one Ethernet jack in the living room, but the DVR needs a WAN IP (and the HTPC is part of the LAN). So I configured two VLANs.</p><p><strong>Router</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;rtl8366s&#039;
    option vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option ports &#039;1 2 3t 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;rtl8366s&#039;
    option vlan &#039;2&#039;
    option ports &#039;0 3t 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Port 3 links the switch to the router. I&#039;d like to use port 0 as the second, separate WAN port. I was told port 3 needs to be tagged in both VLANs.</p><br /><p><strong>Switch</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;
    option vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option ports &#039;0 1t 2 3 5t&#039;

    option vlan &#039;2&#039;
    option ports &#039;1t 4 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Port 1 links the switch to the router so I tagged it in both VLANs. Port 4 connects the DVR.</p><p>I have configured a &#039;Digiwan&#039; interface for the second WAN port (on the router). I am not sure whether to set it to &#039;Unmanaged&#039; or keep it on &#039;DHCP&#039; - I guess it should be unmanaged so it doesn&#039;t interfere with the DVR requesting an IP address? <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;digiwan&#039;
    option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Is this correct, or is there some kind of bridging needed (like on the LAN interface)? Do I need to add a separate firewall zone? I have added one:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
    option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option forward &#039;REJECT&#039;
    option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option name &#039;digiwan&#039;
    option network &#039;digiwan&#039;
    option masq &#039;1&#039;
    option mtu_fix &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>(I guess the input part should read REJECT as well like on the WAN interface settings.)</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 13 Apr 2014, 18:13)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure I understand your setup correctly.<br />Are you running two cables between &quot;ISP&quot; and WNDR3700?<br />Do you want a direct layer 2 path between the DVR and ISP equipment?<br />And no layer 3/IP routing between the DVR and the LAN of WNDR3700?<br />Or would a one-to-one NAT between the DVR and the second WAN IP (in that case obtained by WNDR3700) do what you want?<br />And then preserve IP routing between the DVR and LAN.<br />In first scenario I guess you would bridge.</p>									</div>

					<p>By having VLAN 2 untagged from port 0 on the router (the true wan) and tag to port 3, and then pick up the tags on port 1 of the switch with untagged on port 4, you should be creating a layer 2 network between the dvr and the cable modem (or whatever that is).&nbsp; You would not need any interfaces, routes, or firewalls since the traffic is all layer 2.&nbsp; This is based on the presumption that both the router and switch are doing well-behaved VLAN transactions.&nbsp; I presume that you set it up and it doesn&#039;t work?&nbsp; Troubleshooting it should be as easy as getting a laptop with wireshark, and following all the ARP broadcasts from the CMTS (assuming youre on a cable modem) to see what point they stop.</p>									</div>

The one-to-one NAT is just that you redirect all traffic from &quot;WAN IP2&quot; to one specific private LAN IP and the other way around (DNAT+SNAT/MASQ).<br />In case you needed to access the DVR from your LAN, play recordings etc. And you would be able have the WNDR3700 firewalling the DVR. Do remember to firewall :- )</p>									</div>

With the layer 2 solution the OpenWrt firewall in WNDR3700 can&#039;t guard the DVR. But you are probably right that there&#039;s a firewall in your ISP router.<br />That the triple play DVR needs an IP from the ISP router, is that something they are stating? They might be doing more than IP traffic, perhaps the IPTV is coming in on its own VLAN? If that&#039;s the case the NAT&#039;ing is off the table :- )</p>									</div>

					<p>The DVR settings panel shows both a private and a public IP. Nobody seems to know for sure whether it&#039;s just the public IP that does it, and customer service doesn&#039;t know jack about it; a seperate VLAN makes sense.</p>									</div>
