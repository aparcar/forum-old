					<p>Dear All</p><p>I&#039;m sorry if I ask a stupid question. Is mt7620n Soc support adhoc mode? coz I have tiny router with MT7620n SoC and I configure for adhoc mode but It says &quot;wireless maybe disable or Not Associated&quot;. in other words, adhoc mode not working? any advice for me?</p><p>Thanks for read and reply my question</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Use the iw command to see driver and hardware capabilities.&nbsp; Luci may say that because it doesn&#039;t recognize the mode (also realize in adhoc mode, you never associate with any specific station).&nbsp; You probably need to configure directly by editing /etc/config/wireless.</p>									</div>
