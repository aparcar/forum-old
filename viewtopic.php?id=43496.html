					<p>the whole point of the bootstrap theme is that it should adjust to the browser width, including even mobile screens. can you post a screenshot of what you&#039;re describing? </p><p>Are you referring to vertical or horizontal scrolling? I agree that it is not very efficient at the use of vertical space, but horizontal scrolling is much more annoying.</p>									</div>

					<p>I totally agree on the horizontal scrolling, but the vertical spacing is just as annoying.<br />As I never us a mobile device to administer the router, its admin interface is totally inaccessible from the WEB.<br />As a result I don&#039;t see the advantages that you might, whereas I find the extra vertical scrolling annoying.<br />To each his own I suppose.</p>									</div>

					<p>i also do not administer from a mobile device, but i do appreciate the bootstrap theme. I completely agree about the vertical scrolling. There is a lot of unnecessary spacing between elements. I think this is supposed to make it more touch friendly. personally I&#039;d like to see a theme similar to Tomato, which is very efficient with space.</p>									</div>
