					<p>Greetings,<br />I&#039;m using openwrt 15.05 on a TP-Link 841N. On my laptop, I have the CrashPlan backup service running on the wireless network, which uploads at the usual low speed. The problem is that after a while the WAN connection is either very slow or completely drops, and I also have problems connecting to the router itself via LAN (very slow connection). The only way I can solve it is by doing a hard reboot of the router.<br />This happens with all the devices connected to the router, either via wireless or cable and only when CrashPlan is running.<br />The WAN connection is PPPoE and goes through a modem. Only resetting the modem won&#039;t work, I have to reboot the router.<br />Is there anything that I&#039;ve missed in the settings?</p>									</div>
