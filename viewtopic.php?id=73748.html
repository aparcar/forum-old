					<p>Log in to the router by wifi (on your &quot;home&quot; AP, which goes to the router&#039;s LAN network) while making these changes.&nbsp; If you are connected by Ethernet, it will likely lose access in the middle of making changes.</p><p>This unit has a RT3052 SoC, so even though there is only one Ethernet port wired up, you still have to configure the switch on the chip.&nbsp; All Ethernet traffic comes from port eth0 on the CPU then passes through the switch section before it leaves the chip.&nbsp; To save space and money, D-Link only connected one of the switch outputs to an Ethernet port.&nbsp; The other switch channels dead-end inside the router.</p><p>Go to Network--Switch and change the CPU and the active Ethernet port to be tagged in VLAN 1.&nbsp; Add a new VLAN 6 and set the CPU and the Ethernet port to tagged in that VLAN also.&nbsp; The other 4 ports can be &quot;off&quot;.&nbsp; </p><p>It is now configured so that eth0.1 will go out to the Ethernet cable tagged with VLAN 1, and eth0.6 will go on the same cable tagged with VLAN 6.</p><p>Go to Network--Interfaces and click the edit button on LAN.&nbsp; &nbsp;Click physical settings.&nbsp; Change from eth0 to eth0.1.&nbsp; When you are using VLANs you should not use plain eth0 for anything.</p><p>Go back to the main Network--Interfaces page and add a new interface called &#039;guest&#039;.&nbsp; The protocol should be &quot;unmanaged,&quot; since this network will be merely a bridge from wifi to Ethernet port.&nbsp; On physical settings, make this network a bridge and attach it to eth0.6, your guest VLAN.</p><p>Go to Network-Wireless and add a wifi AP for guests.&nbsp; Attach it to the guest network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Apr 2018, 15:59)</p>
