					<p>it behaves exactly the same way like my WDR3600 which has the same hardware like the WDR4300 (only the 5ghz wireless chip is different)<br />a quick and dirty solution is on the topic that I posted earlier and a member here was kind enough to provide me a solution working on gargoyle latest build (based on openwrt), but you can apply it to any newer build if you follow those steps on your particular configuration</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43131">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43131</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paradoxman</strong> on 6 Apr 2013, 08:48)</p>
