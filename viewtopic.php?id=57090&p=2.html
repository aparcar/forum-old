Force of habit; I couldn&#039;t be bothered with a factory restore and reconfiguring afterwards. Don&#039;t know if I should have done, but it doesn&#039;t appear to have broken anything.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HooTooJunkie wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I know the <strong>squashfs-sysupgrade</strong>.bin is the file to use, after changing the original factory FW ...<br />But what&#039;s the <strong>initramfs-uImage</strong> file for, shown in that same folder?<br />(<em>Just curious</em>) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p></blockquote></div><p>Without reading the release notes, I&#039;m not sure (or can&#039;t remember). I would hazard a guess that it might be the file to use for the first change from the manufacturer&#039;s firmware to OpenWRT. I put OpenWRT on my TM02 as soon as I bought it, which was a while ago.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HooTooJunkie wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What if I wanted to place this VPN TM02 before my main router?<br />In other words, have the Cable-Modem Ethernet go into the TM02 Ethernet, instead of my main router, and my main router linked to the TM02 thru WiFi.</p></blockquote></div><p>It&#039;s certainly technically possible (configure eth0 as the WAN and wlan0 as the LAN), but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. The TM02 is woefully underpowered and I suspect it would become a bottleneck. Your router&#039;s throughput should always be faster than the speed your ISP offers, not slower. Shunting packets around at high speed takes CPU power and RAM.</p><p>On top of this, if you&#039;re contemplating any sort of white-listing or filtering, or even a VPN server, then that takes even more CPU power and RAM. Your router is actually a little computer, albeit one which is optimised for network traffic, and, as with all computers, faster CPUs and more RAM is better. I&#039;d be happy to use the TM02 as a VPN server if all I was doing was simple admin work in a text console, e.g. SSH or Telnet. I wouldn&#039;t want to use it for anything data-heavy, such as a graphical remote console, video streaming, or the like.</p><p>Lastly, WiFi is half-duplex, not full-duplex, is contended between all of your wireless devices, and you will never achieve the headline speed advertised by the manufacturer. This is especially noticeable when the wireless router has a slow CPU and not much RAM available.</p><p>This page - <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/tools/charts/router/view">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/tools/charts/router/view</a> - gives some benchmark wired throughput figures for lots of different devices. Right down near the bottom of the list, with a pitiful 36.6Mbps, is the TP-Link TL-WR710N. The specs of this device are very similar to the HooToo TM02 - see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp-link/tp-link_tl-wr710n_1">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp- … l-wr710n_1</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/hootoo/hootoo_tripmatenano_v15">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/hoo … tenano_v15</a> and compare the CPU speeds and RAM.</p><p>As a comparison, the GL-MT300N has a 580MHz CPU and 64MB RAM - <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/mt300n/#1442566013976-f19448f7-2698">http://www.gl-inet.com/mt300n/#14425660 … 448f7-2698</a> - and Amazon UK has it for 22 quid. I&#039;ve ordered one out of curiosity; it should arrive some time next week.&nbsp; </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HooTooJunkie wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>-- would there still be a need to create a forwarding rule for the main house router, as you needed to do with your Buffalo router?&nbsp; Or does the forwarding rule now need to be placed on the TM02, or both routers?</p></blockquote></div><p>The only reason I offered an instruction for a port-forwarding rule was because I was testing OpenVPN on an internal device on my network for the purpose of this thread - the TM02. </p><p>Normally I run OpenVPN directly on the Buffalo, I have only one port open to the outside world - UDP 1194 - and I don&#039;t have any port forwards configured. Once I connect to the VPN then I&#039;m on my home LAN and can interact with all the devices on my network. </p><p>If you&#039;re planning on making the TM02 your public-facing router, then you also won&#039;t need any port forwarding configured, for the same reason. If all you want to do is browse the Internet as if you were at home, then you&#039;re done.</p><p>If your other computers are connected via Ethernet to the WRT54G then you can configure the WRT54G as an access point (or wireless bridge) instead of a router (assuming you can do so; I&#039;m not familiar with the software on that device) and your other wired equipment should also be accessible to you over the VPN. If you can&#039;t configure the WRT54G as an access point/wireless bridge then you&#039;re into the realm of routing tables, which is beyond the scope of this thread.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HooTooJunkie wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;m considering doing this setup, because I also want to create an IP White-List, on the TM02 to filter everything except my needed allowed ports and IP / URL&#039;s to enter, before it gets to my main router.</p><p>I&#039;ve been getting hackers constantly trying to get into port 520, among others, and figured I can also block them from even getting into my computers if I block it with this TM02.</p><p>My main router doesn&#039;t support OpenWRT.&nbsp; ( WRT54G v8 )</p></blockquote></div><p>My advice? Do one of two things:<br />* Ditch the WRT54G and buy a fast router which will run OpenWRT as well as a white-list/filter - <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_available_864">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_ … ilable_864</a> - install OpenVPN on it, and don&#039;t bother trying to daisy-chain multiple routers, or;<br />* Keep the WRT54G and buy/build a cheap computer and install Ubuntu or similar on it, and use that as your OpenVPN server. I recently installed OpenVPN on a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Jessie; it&#039;s a single-NIC device just like the TM02 or TL-MR3020, so lots of the principles were the same or similar. </p><p>Lastly, keep the TM02 as a cute little toy for experimentation and teaching yourself about OpenWRT, networking, and other related concepts.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HooTooJunkie wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>One note from your additional info regarding the VPN config...<br />The original config listed in your TM02 post didn&#039;t have the <strong>option mute 20</strong> line at the end...<br />as the new example you show at post #23<br /> <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=316706#p316706">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 06#p316706</a></p><p>Does that line need to also be used, or you were just giving an example?</p></blockquote></div><p>Fixed. I inadvertently missed that line out when copying the config file originally.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>600cc</strong> on 26 Mar 2016, 03:40)</p>
