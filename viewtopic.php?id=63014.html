					<p>I just purchased a Vonets VHT4G mini router wall-plug/router combo.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to get into it with telnet, SSH, ftp, nothing worked except the web interface.&nbsp; Sold as a USB modem router but the list of supported modems inside the web interface was ancient.&nbsp; &nbsp; I went through all the configuration pages and there was no apparent way to enable telnet,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, the update firmware option does not allow selecting a local directory but instead says &quot;Server busy&quot; when you click on the single button for &quot;Update Firmware&quot;.</p><p>The connections are 1M &amp; 1F USB, plus 1 RJ45 jack.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s it.</p><p>I popped open the top and below are the numbers from all the chips.&nbsp; Any chance of getting OpenWrt installed on this one or did I just purchase an expensive power supply?:</p><p>Model: VHT4G_2V0 vonets.com 918</p><p>Ralink<br />RT5350F<br />TPSY418609<br />1346STA1</p><p>Winbond<br />W9825G6EH-6<br />10255<br />60139G600ZZ</p><p>Suotek<br />S16A-1102<br />1330</p><p>150</p><p>C+ A8 1C</p><p>Pm25L0032<br />CE1351<br />POL422LG</p><p>A71C</p><p>100<br />16V<br />SYK</p><p>20 000<br />323</p><p>4R7</p><p>IAEBD</p><p>(((( Has anyone played with this before and what does one do to see if OpenWRT can be ported to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you in advance)))))</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess there is no interest in this tiny toddler.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have read that a 16M device is not all that great anyway and not sure of the flash size so I will put him to rest in the mighty ziploc until another day.&nbsp; &nbsp;With no client switch capability in the closed web interface, about all this one is good for is for a cheap short-range access point or &quot;hotel router&quot; like they say (assuming I ever stayed in a hotel with wired-only rooms, he, he).&nbsp; &nbsp;In the mean time, I&#039;ve landed myself what looks like a true 2.1A power supply for even cheaper than what I&#039;d pay locally for it alone, so all is not lost.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did some more experimenting with this device.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no Telnet or SSH available.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried both from the default wifi radio access and also after changing the settings to allow access to the configuration engine from the WAN (Ethernet cable) side as well.&nbsp; Neither allowed anything but access to the web interface.&nbsp; Telnet, SSH, FTP, Finger all failed.&nbsp; Additionally, the firmware&#039;s only option is to serve as access point fueled by either a LAN cable or a limited list of cell modems.&nbsp; &nbsp;The firmware is web update only.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used Wireshark and it looks like the firmware first pulls down a HTML form from the server to check if the firmware is needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s not a simple matter of it checking for a file and downloading it.&nbsp; So even if you set up a re-directed local emulated firmware supply server and were able to figure out what format that file should be in, there is the issue of figuring out the form check handshake.&nbsp; Also the land patterns are too small for me to see with a heavy magnifier, much less trying to get my circa 80&#039;s soldering iron in a position to mod it with serial pins, so I am abandoning this project.&nbsp; &nbsp;The heavy duty power supply is all I will keep from this misguided purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems as if it work great as a hotel wired to wireless access point, something I will never need because I will take instead a more versatile setup powered by an OfModemsAndMen port of OpenWRT.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I&#039;d say, don&#039;t waste your time; go with a A5-V11 or clone if you need something small.&nbsp; &nbsp;Too bad they locked in the firmware on this as it appears as one of the smallest full-on routers I&#039;ve seen so far.if you discount the space occupied by the detachable power supply.</p>									</div>

					<p>In an extreme case, you can use the dump from the same &quot;HAME&quot; and using the programmer CH341A + clip EEPROM / 25CXX (for it was not necessary to solder), pour it directly into the memory chip.</p>									</div>
