					<p>LEDE TORGUARD OPENVPN TUTORIAL - ADD Https:// in front of links below (<strong> links =&nbsp; BOLD TEXT</strong> )</p><p>Regards<br />Mike<br />OK - I decided to put this up on the TorGuard Forum as I could not find a tutorial anywhere with specific step by step instructions for getting Torguard OPENVPN working with OpenWrt/ Lede. In advance, I want to thank the excellent support team at TorGuard ( especially Mike &amp; Andy ) for assisting me with getting my Lede/Openwrt VPN router up and running.<br />I use davidc502 firmware which is described as&nbsp; Moderately Customized LEDE Development Builds found here - <strong>davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/releases/ </strong>and here - <strong>davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/snapshots/ </strong>-- davidc502&#039;s forum found here - <strong>forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64949&amp;p=164b</strong>&nbsp; - Dave&#039;s builds are for Linksys WRT1900AC v1 Linksys WRT1900AC v2 Linksys WRT1900ACS Linksys WRT3200ACM Linksys WRT1200AC models ONLY !!! One of the many benefits of using Dave&#039;s custom firmware is that it comes with many pre-installed and configured software packages - including OpenVpn and Dnscrypt - I use both in conjunction on my router. For full list of packages see Dave&#039;s configuration seed found here -&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/releases/config.seed </strong>- However, the guide tutorial here will work on any and every OpenWrt/ Lede firmware based router. I also tested this with Lede stable firmware ( current version 17.01.4 ) found here -<strong> lede-project.org/downloads</strong> -<br />Anyway - here we go - this is Mike&#039;s detailed original answer to my inquiry concerning my request for assistance in setting up OpenVpn on OpenWrt /Lede. I have added a few edits in order to make this more comprehensible and easier to implement. This guide&nbsp; will work Guaranteed if you follow instructions step by step.<br />Mike // Staff</p><p>Thank you, can you check if the steps below works ok for you</p><p>1) Then in Luci Gui&nbsp; go to System &gt; Software, do update first ( ssh command opkg update )<br />then search for openvpn and install openvpn-openssl and luci-app-openvpn. ( ssh command -&nbsp; opkg install openvpn-openssl luci-app-openvpn )<br />These are necessary - Luci is GUI frontend for Openwrt - it comes pre-installed with davidc502&#039;s firmware. Also installed on Lede stable. </p><p>2) Here you Generate OpenVpn config on <strong>torguard.net/tgconf.php?action=vpn-openvpnconfig</strong> choosing openwrt.</p><p>3) Login using ftp client like winscp to the router (openwrt) and the config file downloaded from the tool to be uploaded to box and renamed as /etc/config/openvpn<br />To make this simpler - you can copy and paste the newly generated text file to a text file on your desktop and /or download config file to your desktop. Install nano ( preferred text editor ) - <br />opkg install nano - if you need to install nano - <br />(&nbsp; if not already there / comes pre-installed in davidc502&#039;s builds )<br />to your router. SSH into router then type ( copy and paste ) -&quot;&nbsp; nano /etc/config/openvpn &quot; ( without parenthesis )&nbsp; - erase all contents of file ( Ctrl + k )&nbsp; and replace ( copy and paste ) with contents of config file you copied and downloaded earlier. <br />Sample of my&nbsp; /etc/config/openvpn config file -&nbsp; adjust yours as you see fit but stick with config from <strong>torguard.net/tgconf.php?action=vpn-openvpnconfig</strong> as your basic guide -</p><p>config openvpn &#039;TorGuard_AES256GCM_SHA256&#039;<br />&nbsp;

wget -P /etc/openvpn/torguard <strong>torguard.net/downloads/ta.key</strong> &quot;&nbsp; ( without parenthesis ) - copy and paste - (&nbsp; ta.key is downloaded to /etc/openvpn/torguard folder )</p><p>B - &quot;

&nbsp; &nbsp;chmod 0777 /etc/openvpn/torguard/ca.crt&nbsp; &nbsp;chmod 0400 /etc/openvpn/torguard/userpass.txt</p><p>There are two alternative methods available in order to create the necessary openvpn network interface and complimentary firewall rules. The first one I will </p><p>feature is through the command line shell - using uci commands. </p><p>The second is simply done through the Luci Web GUI. Personally, I use the uci command line approach as I feel the firewall rules for the vpn connection are more </p><p>secure in nature using this method. For the sake of this tutorial, consider command line - uci - Scenario A - and Luci Web Gui method - Scenario B. Both will create </p><p>an interface and working firewall rules and in the end - and leave you with a working TorGuard OpenVpn configuration and subsequent connection. GUARANTEED !</p><p>Remember this is either A or B - not A AND B !!! - you can not use both. It is one or the other.</p><p>Scenario A -</p><p>TorGuard OpenVpn Network Interface Creation and Setup via command line - uci </p><p>uci set network.myvpnc=interface<br />uci set network.myvpnc.proto=none<br />uci set network.myvpnc.ifname=tun0<br />uci commit network</p><p>TorGuard OpenVpn Firewall Rules Setup via command line - uci</p><p>uci add firewall zone<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1]=zone<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1].name=myvpnc_fw<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1].network=myvpnc<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1].input=REJECT<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1].output=ACCEPT<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1].forward=REJECT<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1].masq=1<br />uci set firewall.@zone[-1].mtu_fix=1<br />uci add firewall forwarding<br />uci set firewall.@forwarding[-1]=forwarding<br />uci set firewall.@forwarding[-1].src=lan<br />uci set firewall.@forwarding[-1].dest=myvpnc_fw<br />uci commit firewall<br />reboot</p><br /><p>Scenario B - </p><p>TorGuard OpenVpn - Luci ( Web Gui ) Network Interface Creation and Setup and Firewall Rules Setup</p><p>1 ) Back on Luci ( Lede/OpenWrt Gui ). Go to Network &gt; Interfaces and add new interface name the interface &quot; MYVPN &quot; - make sure the &quot; Protocol of the new interface &quot;&nbsp; at top of page is set to&nbsp; &quot; Unmanaged &quot; and at bottom of page select &quot; Custom &quot; and enter &quot;&nbsp; tun0 &quot; ( tun number zero ) in the field next to custom radio button.</p><p>Click On Submit then Save and Save and Apply Settings</p><p>2 ) Go to Network &gt; Firewall section, click add &quot; new zone &quot; and make it to &quot; &quot;accept &quot; ( all three up top - accept all options )&nbsp; input/output/forward/masquarde, ( check &quot; masquerade &quot; box under where you accepting all .<br />Then choose - enter check mark in box next to&nbsp; interface VPN&nbsp; ( Covered networks ).<br />Then in bottom box &quot; Inter-Zone Forwarding &quot; (&nbsp; Allow forward to destination zones: ) = LAN and&nbsp; then</p><p>( Allow forward from source zones: ) = LAN</p><p>This means click both radio buttons next to lan in last section on firewall &quot; newzone &quot; you just created.</p><p>Lastly, Click On Save and Save and Apply Settings -</p><p>3 ) Go to Services &gt; Openvpn and start the VPN service.</p><p>All should be up and running after this. Support said they would post this in tutorials for Openwrt/Lede firmware. As I said, I just put this up to save folks time </p><p>if they run TorGuard VPN. By the way, it is an excellent VPN service.&nbsp; Easier setup than PIA VPN - specifically on Lede/Openwrt. Again - thanks to TorGuard Support.</p><p>Let us know if you have any further questions.</p><p>Regards<br />Mike</p><p>LEDE - OPENWRT TORGUARD VPN SETUP</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>directnupe</strong> on 31 Dec 2017, 17:31)</p>

					<p>I dont think a &quot;logread -f &gt;&gt; /mnt/usb/logging.log &amp;&quot; would work in the case of a kernel panic. How would it work if the CPU got stuck or a driver crashes? It cant work. It would mostly just log everything until the kernel panic, and not give any helpful information for the important crash part.

Of course unused memory is wasted memory... BUT, a router shouldnt see a increase in memory over time like this, especially not a linear increase. This is more a sign for a memory leak of some component running on the router. Mine has about 54MB after boot, and after a few days still 55MB. It is suddenly had like 150MB after a few days, this is bad and a sign for some part is not properly working or badly programmed.</p><p>Question for David: Do your builds btw have CPUIDLE disabled by default?

					<p>To be honest, it does not look normal to me either, I&#039;ve never seen it in another router/fw, but that&#039;s my first router with Lede firmware, so I have no idea what&#039;s normal here.

					<p>What I am trying to explain is that you should not worry about <strong>free</strong> memory, because Linux has been designed to use as much memory as possible: &quot;unused memory is wasted memory&quot;, and given enough time, any well-functioning system will tend to end with near zero free memory.</p><p>If your system is low on free memory, because most of it is being used as <strong>cache</strong>, then your system is working as expected. When the need arises, that cache will be flushed, and more memory will be available for processes. Meanwhile, lots of files are being cached in memory, and your system is faster.</p><p>What you should worry about is <strong>used</strong> memory: if the amount of used memory increases over time without a justification, then there is some process <em>leaking</em> memory; and that is a bad thing. So far, people has only complained about free memory, not used memory.</p>									</div>
