					<p>Has anyone tried to run FreeRadius or another radius server ON OpenWRT.</p><p>I was thinking of a Hotspot in a box:</p><p>Asus 520p/Fonera 2.0 + USB Storage + FreeRadius providing Hotspot via Chillispot (captive portal) &amp; LEAP for WPA2 Enterprise auth. Having Dual SSID, one for Chillispot, and another for the WPA2</p><p>Anyone tried this????</p>									</div>

					<p>So the problem with FreeRADIUS is, it wants to fork off a bunch of processes.&nbsp; This is not a problem on a basic Linux PC which has comparatively tons of RAM and some swap.&nbsp; The problem is your typical OpenWRT system does not have tons of RAM and has no swap.&nbsp; I think a 64 meg RAM system is the minimum I&#039;d want to try this on.&nbsp; For this usage what is really needed is a RADIUS server that runs in a single process.&nbsp; It could be massively stripped down as FreeRADIUS does a lot of things that are frankly not needed in small shops.</p><p>I run NEARLY everything on 32 meg RAM WRT54GS v1.0 and WRTSL54GS units at some remote WISP sites.&nbsp; OpenVPN for a secure pipe back to mothership, ChilliSpot for the captive portal.&nbsp; Room left over for a few utilities. However these routers point back to a full Linux PC (well actually a tiny fit-PC Slim unit) that runs Ubuntu and hosts main website and RADIUS.</p>									</div>

					<p>What I was looking for was yes, a massively stripped down version of FreeRadius or if someone has done some work along the lines of:</p><p>FreeRadiusLite + SQLite which would support EAP auth... however I am not sure how much load is put on the Radius server from (P/L)EAP(-TLS), but it would make for a very tidy solution to have it all on the local router.</p><p>I only want to have a pool of about 20 or so users, but using RADIUS so I can have individual logins via Chillispot or similar captive portal and / or associations via EAP using the same username and password, onto a different SSID with WPA2 enabled.&nbsp; This would also give accounting / quasi billing to monitor usage over the WIFI to make sure no one is being too excessive on the traffic front.</p>									</div>

					<p>Check out <a href="http://coova.org/">Coova.org</a>, it&#039;s an OpenWrt-based hotspot solution that sounds similar to what you want.</p>									</div>
