					<p>I&#039;m looking for an ADSL (Annex A) gateway with the following attributes:</p><p> - Can run OpenWRT without *too* much persuasion (I&#039;m happy to run something out of trunk)<br /> - Has a 4 port ethernet switch that can be divided up into 2 or more port-based (ie untagged) VLANs.<br /> - Is readily available / easy to source in modest quantities (hundreds) in Europe.<br /> - is cheap (&lt; USD100)</p><p>I had thought the Linksys AG241v2 was a runner, but OpenWRT doesn&#039;t have full support for the onboard ethernet switch - it&#039;s not possible to configure it with VLANs (or anything else for that matter) due to GPIO issues.</p><p>Has anybody got any suggestions?</p><br /><p>-rdj</p>									</div>
