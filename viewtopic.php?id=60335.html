					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am very new to openWRT, just flashed openWRT onto my spare router to test the water.<br />The router in question is a &quot;TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v1.10&quot; and I have &quot;Chaos Calmer 15.05&quot; installed.</p><br /><p>I am trying to connect to LuCI using https.<br />I found this guide - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.secure">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.secure</a><br />But I ran right into a brick wall<br />&quot;To access an HTTPS page is just typing <a href="https://openwrt.lan">https://openwrt.lan</a> instead of <a href="http://openwrt.lan">http://openwrt.lan</a>.&quot;<br /><a href="https://192.168.1.1">https://192.168.1.1</a> gives me a 404 error, no issues with plain http.</p><br /><p>There&#039;s a note to ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials#installation">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci. … stallation</a><br />Unfortunately I am completely lost on that page, its directing me to install LuCI? Isn&#039;t LuCI already installed?</p><br /><p>I have also looked around the package manager within LuCI, however it had no new updates. But as this link shows - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/packages">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/packages</a> - there are clearly many packages out there.</p><p>I also have no clue on how to execute these &quot;OPKG&quot; commands, where do I execute them from?</p><p>tl;dr<br />1) How to connect to LuCI using https?<br />2) How do I install more packages?<br />3) How/Where do I execute &quot;OPKG&quot; commands?</p><p>A clear step-by-step guide would be appreciated! I suspect I&#039;m missing out on some prerequisite knowledge, feeling quite lost and confused :x</p>									</div>

					<p>It tells you to install <strong>luci-ssl</strong> and it&#039;s dependencies. The <strong>SSL</strong> or secure sockets layer support is not included by default.</p><p>So <strong>opkg install luci-ssl</strong> (after <strong>opkg update</strong> if not done yet today or since boot) and it will also grab the required dependencies. Then reboot and you can access the router using https. You also end up with a bunch of warnings in modern browsers due to the default use of older security algorithms, mainly about SHA1 and the self signed certificate.</p><p>If you SSH into the router to you can use opkg and lots of other utilities.</p><p>However in the web interface: System -&gt; Software.

					<p>Hi all, thanks for the replies. Sorry for my slow response, work woes ~~</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>DBAA wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>However in the web interface: System -&gt; Software. Press the Update Lists button, set the filter to <strong>luci-ssl</strong>, press Find Package, then switch the tab below to Available Packages, install it and reboot.</p></blockquote></div><p>It says &quot;No package lists available&quot;.</p><p>And produces the following error when I try to update the package list.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GFXf7Md.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/GFXf7Md.jpg" /></span></p><p>Any ideas on whats happening? Should I open a separate thread?<br />Perhaps worth noting is that I currently have this router configured as a dumb switch, it has a static IP (outside the DHCP range) and its own DHCP is disabled. That said, I&#039;ve had no connection issues. Is it possible the device needs a direct connection to update the package list?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>stangri wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Any practical reason you want to access luci thru HTTPS? Are you concerned of MiTM attacks between you and your router by any chance?.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yeah I&#039;m trying to minimise man in the middle risks.<br />Actually once I get https working, I would wish to disable http access. I&#039;ve also noted that there is no obvious way to disable remote management or wireless management in LuCI. Essentially I want to restrict admin access to only a https physical LAN connection.<br />Any input or advice is welcome!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>albert099</strong> on 20 Oct 2015, 06:39)</p>

					<p>Okay finally some good news, I managed to get https working on LuCI!<br />Long story short, just follow what DBAA said.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>DBAA wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>It tells you to install <strong>luci-ssl</strong> and it&#039;s dependencies. The <strong>SSL</strong> or secure sockets layer support is not included by default.</p><p>However in the web interface: System -&gt; Software. Press the Update Lists button, set the filter to luci-ssl, press Find Package, then switch the tab below to Available Packages, install it and reboot.</p></blockquote></div><p>For the benefit of others who might find this:<br />I had some proxy issues that prevented me from getting the luci-ssl package through the LuCI interface, but that&#039;s probably due to my particular network setup.<br />I worked around it by manually downloading the luci-ssl package and uploading it into the router. <br />You can find the index URL to browse the packages manually from the OPKG-Configuration page (from LuCI: system&gt;software&gt;configuration tab) <br />I used <strong>WinSCP</strong> (<a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">https://winscp.net/eng/download.php</a>) to upload the package files into my router.<br />I used <strong>Putty</strong> (<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgta … nload.html</a>) to SSH into my router.<br />The command to install packages is &quot;<strong>opkg install &lt;package name&gt;.ipk</strong>&quot;<br />You might have to navigate to the correct directory by using the &quot;<strong>cd /&lt;directory name&gt;</strong>&quot; command<br />I did get prompted to get another package, as it was needed as a dependency.<br />Then reboot the router.<br />And voila! https works, albeit with certificate warnings, but that&#039;s beyond the scope of this post.</p><p>@DBAA thanks for your help!<br />Would you consider adding what you know into the openWRT wiki? I searched high and low but your advice by far is the most beginner friendly and straightforward way to enable https. Check out the somewhat relevant wiki entry (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/secure.access#webui">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/secure.access#webui</a>), there is no mention of the luci-ssl package! https should be a basic requirement imho, and everyone should set it up. Not everyone knows what is SSH much less how to use it, me included 1 week ago.<br />Please feel free to copy what I wrote above as a starting point.<br />Thanks once again!</p>									</div>
