					<p>@RangerZ: thank you for your interest.</p><p>There is a new proposed solution that will improve the situation much. Quite much like you suggest. Filtering and sorting on any column will work. And there will be a wide table with everything, and more narrow tables with fewer details, and they will all show the same underlying data. Editing will be improved (form based, with dropdowns and stuff). Export to CSV will be possible.</p><p>About your suggested fields... we have just introduced an &quot;Availability Field&quot; (dropdown with values like: Available, Discontinued, Discontinued 2014). Battery Power is a new idea, not being discussed before. It makes sense. Other people find the Detachable Antennas field useful so I think it will stay. When it comes to things like HDD/SATA/eSATA it is tricky with those things that are relatively rare.</p><p>We are in the phase of polishing the data for the final (at least release candidate) import into the new improved &quot;table&quot;. We are also waiting for a few server side fixes to enable the new functionality.</p>									</div>

					<p>That IS a relevant use case.

It would be great if people with more information (an actual piece of hardware) could update the information.</p><p>Supported = Unknown.</p><p>I will look at more.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems some issues with the demowiki and the dataplugin.<br />I&#039;m now running the update again, but with corrected type definitions (admin area, not on the datapages). In fact, the WIP and 10.03 were missing in the type definitions, and hence were not displayed.<br />However, even after manually setting the 10.03 and WIP in the dataentries, they didn&#039;t show up in the datatable.</p><p>Maybe some caching issue. I will check and report back.</p>									</div>
