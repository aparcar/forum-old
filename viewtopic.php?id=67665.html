					<p>Hello, Just switched over to OpenWRT as the final official firmware for my router left a bad memory leak issue. So far, I am really enjoying it, but there is one thing I am curious about.</p><p>I have a small range I use for static IPs (192.168.1.160-169), which was never a problem before as previously DHCP had been setup to use 192.168.1.100-150. Now, it seems like DNSMasq assigns freely from 100 to 254, and I am worried about it assigning to one of the static addresses. Is there a way in Luci to adjust the range used, or do I need to do it in the DNSMasq config file? I have no problem doing that, I&#039;d just prefer to do it in Luci for sake of consistancy.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

So, the old default was 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.150, giving 51 total possible IPs. Most routers I&#039;ve worked with in the past have been sorta this way. Some even would have it to where you set the range, as well as the pool size (in case you wanted fewer than the range could allow for).</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>stangri wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>@Hellmark -- in luci: Network -&gt; Interfaces -&gt; LAN/Edit -&gt; General Setup (DHCP Server).
