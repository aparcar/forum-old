					<p>I&#039;m referring to the configuration option in /etc/config/network: see wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</p><p>Can someone explain to me why the default setting for &quot;force_link&quot; is different depending on the &quot;proto&quot; option?</p><p>In my device, force_link was not specified, but proto was &#039;dhcp&#039;, so force_link defaulted to &#039;0&#039;.<br />This worked great.<br />But subsequently, if I changed proto to &#039;static&#039;, I was having issues. I eventually realised that these issues were due to the fact that force_link was now defaulting to &#039;1&#039;, which meant that carrier sense events were not being handled.<br />I have now explicitly set force_link to &#039;0&#039;, and all is good again.</p><p>But I&#039;m concerned that I may be missing something. There must be a good reason why force_link defaults to &#039;1&#039; for proto &#039;static&#039;. What is it? If I over-ride the default, are there side-effects of which I need to be aware?</p>									</div>
