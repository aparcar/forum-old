					<p>Hi there!&nbsp; I have been messing with OpenWRT and some of the other open-source firmwares recently.&nbsp; I am able to get around and modify config files, etc. but I sometimes get stuck when it comes to advanced concepts.&nbsp; I would like to buy a book or multiple books that would help me understand what I am doing here.&nbsp; I was thinking books on linux, the C programming language, TCP/IP, routing concepts, and/or iptables would be helpful here.</p><p>Could someone recommend a book or a series of books that would help me understand OpenWRT and become more involved? </p><p>Thanks<br />Jason</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt; get stuck when it comes to advanced concepts</p><p>The solution are the hundred of Linux-support forums.</p><p>&gt; books on GNU/Linux<br />There is so much stuff online:<br /><a href="http://debiananwenderhandbuch.de">http://debiananwenderhandbuch.de</a>/&nbsp; There gotta be an english version somewhere.<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch</a><br /><a href="http://luv.asn.au/overheads/linux-startup.html">http://luv.asn.au/overheads/linux-startup.html</a></p><p>and countless other stuff.</p><p>&gt; C programming language<br />1.&nbsp; <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a></p><p>I cannot recommend one, but for C you should by a book or two. Try the local library first. Or a college or university library, there is the good stuff. The later you wont be allowed to borrow as non-student, but you can read them in situ.</p><p>&gt; iptables<br />Check my article:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/netfilter#configuration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/netfi … figuration</a><br />Use together with the iptables manpage, the tutorial from frozentux and the picture from engelhardt.</p><p>&gt; TCP/IP<br />read about packet based communication. The wikipedia is IMHO quite full of shit, much low quality articles with little value, but it is a start ;-)<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a></p><p>Understand what a communication protocol is. IP is one. TCP another. etc. The so called Linux TCP/IP-Stack is a piece of software, that handles TCP/IP-Based communication. Meet it when you read about iptables or IPv6.</p><p>&gt; routing concepts<br />start with wikipedia or simply with google.</p><p>Easiest is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_routing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_routing</a>.</p><p>BTW, how old may you be, and do you plan to study something?</p>									</div>

					<p>Glad you did not link the Tanenbaum &quot;phonebook&quot;.<br />I would like to add <a href="http://www.pronix.de">www.pronix.de</a> for a C course. Again this is in german, but it&#039;s an openbook, and even if you grow with C it&#039;s useful as a reference.</p><p>For OpenWrt, you should do a search on youtube, I recently saw some lecture held during one of the CCC conventions(I think it was 23C3, not sure, but much of that stuff is still valid) on Openwrt, the buildroot and all that stuff. The lecture is in english, but the speaker has some really weird kind of intonation/english skills. Still, it&#039;s a recommendation.</p>									</div>

Learn as you go. As for learning about networking, there is no point in doing that with one machine only. With your Router you have two, but there is nothing to route. Projects like Freifunk should provide machines and expertise. If there is something like that where you live, check them out.</p><p><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Documentation/#Streamdumps">http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki … treamdumps</a><br /><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/wiki/Documentation#Streamdumps">http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/wiki … treamdumps</a><br /><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/wiki/Documentation#Streamdumps">http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/wiki … treamdumps</a></p><p>where is the rest?</p>									</div>

					<p>The quickest way to learn about POSIX type systems and Linux in particular is to force yourself to depend on knowing it by using it as your only system and don&#039;t go running back to whatever you used before at the first sign of trouble.&nbsp; That said, while there is a lot of HOWTO stuff available, there is little &quot;why&quot; stuff.&nbsp; So to really understand this stuff almost requires some heavy reading on UNIX and its philosophy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done that myself as I too am a hobbyist but educated a little closer to this stuff in electronics.&nbsp; A lot of good books exist in the O&#039;Reilly library on all facets of Linux, POSIX (UNIX), programming, and system administration.&nbsp; </p><p>As for learning C, the book &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie is the canonical reference.&nbsp; It is concise and covers a lot of ground.&nbsp; Look for the Second Edition which covers the ANSI C standard.&nbsp; I keep my copy handy for when I need to review a concept.&nbsp; I&#039;m self taught so that is a bit of a disadvantage but the basics of C can be picked up easily.&nbsp; It&#039;s the more clever ways of doing things that start to make my eyes glaze over but that is true in any language.&nbsp; My weaknesses are algebraic formulas and algorithms.</p><p>To be an effective system administrator you will need to know Bourne Shell syntax.&nbsp; The GNU Bash shell is the default Bourne shell on most desktop Linux systems and a lot of the basics will apply to Busybox used in OpenWRT.&nbsp; Again there is plenty of documentation out there to read on Bash.&nbsp; Bash is also quite easy to work with as the programs are simply text scripts the shell interprets.</p><p>Finally, to really enjoy Linux and to be an effective sysadmin, you&#039;ll want to learn a high level language such as Perl or Python or one of the other popular &quot;scripting&quot; languages.&nbsp; Perl borrows a lot from C and the shell so that it becomes quite easy to learn.&nbsp; There is also an incredible library and community around Perl so that help or a module to do some thing is available.&nbsp; Like the shell, Perl interprets your program but unlike the shell, it actually compiles it first so it will find a lot of syntax errors before the code is ever executed.&nbsp; Also, for working with text, nothing beats Perl&#039;s integration of regular expressions.</p><p>At 27 you have a great opportunity to learn a lot of new things.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been playing with this stuff for almost 15 years and there is still much to learn.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting acquainted with IPv6 and such stuff over the past week.</p><p>Have fun!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nate</strong> on 17 Feb 2011, 02:59)</p>

The 1st time I tried Linux Slackware was back in early 90s (when Linux kernel was still on v0.98) and it was distributed on 5 pieces of a 1.44MB disk with no GUI installation! At the time, I had a Zenith i386/20MHz with 16MB RAM configured to dual boot with Linux and Windows 3.1.</p>									</div>
