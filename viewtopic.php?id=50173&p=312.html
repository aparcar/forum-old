					<p>Yes, it is very much a pain to do it that way. I did that at first (same 900+ results, btw) but then switched to this setup for ease.

					<p>So here&#039;s something: I&#039;ve been repeating these off and on. On most runs it will struggle a bit in the first second and then get up to speed. The tests I have posted here show that.
