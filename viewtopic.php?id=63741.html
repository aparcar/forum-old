					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>Bit of an issue here. Seems that wireless isn&#039;t working exactly correct on the Kaloz build from November 27 2015.<br />I just switched to this from CC Final 15.05 because I wanted the updated Kernel for certain features.</p><p>So, lets see if I can list everything that happens.<br />WLAN0 = 2.4GHz radio<br />WLAN1 = 5GHz radio</p><br /><ul><li><p>WLAN0 consistently stays in &quot;wireless is disabled or not associated&quot; mode (yet shows up in iwinfo)</p></li><li><p>When I try to associate it with the LAN interface in the Interface screen, clicking Save &amp; Apply seems to work, until I go back into Interfaces and find it&#039;s still associated with WLAN1. <a href="http://imgur.com/nL3oh22">http://imgur.com/nL3oh22</a></p></li><li><p>When I was first setting up, I noticed that the security settings took on WLAN0, but not WLAN1. WLAN1 was showing functional though. So I re-added the security settings to WLAN1, and it stopped functioning, showing disabled or not associated (also would not show in iwinfo).</p></li><li><p>I removed the security settings from WLAN0, and iwinfo will only display info for WLAN0. WLAN1 still not functioning.</p></li><li><p>With no security settings, iwinfo shows both WLAN0 and WLAN1, but only WLAN1 works (I can connect to it from devices and get internet)</p></li><li><p>In every iteration of settings, iwinfo says the interfaces do not have encryption on them.</p></li></ul><p>In summarisation:<br />WLAN0 never actually works, but without security shows in iwinfo<br />WLAN1 works without security, but not with, and is being affected by setting security on WLAN0</p><p><em>NOTE: Kaloz&#039;s OpenWRT seems to have extra settings displaying in Interface &gt; Physical Settings, and in the Security Settings for wireless. The physical settings in interface seem purely redundant though, so not certain why that is. The security settings are just a lot of excess options, but they&#039;re not terribly organised or documented.</em></p><p>This is REALLY annoying since I&#039;m either missing something, or there&#039;s a bug that I haven&#039;t found reference to anywhere.<br />Any help would be appreciated, as wireless as I really don&#039;t want to be running without wireless, nor do I want it running without security.</p>									</div>

					<p>Updates:</p><p>So here is what has happened since I last posted.<br />Nothing I did from within the GUI seemed to be working, so I copied my wireless config from my CC 15.05 backup, and suddenly it worked.<br />I manually tweaked the backup file to change the SSID to the new setup I wanted(24.example.ca), and my router stopped working correctly (not giving out IPs on wired or wireless, etc).</p><p>I did a 30/30/30 reset, which oddly enough caused it to reinstall CC 15.05 (somehow that&#039;s still the backup after installing a different version?)<br />After resetting, I checked my wireless and they were working.<br />I changed the SSID for WLAN0, and it seemed to accept it, until I changed the security settings. That broke it<br />So, I do a 30/30/30 reset again, re-installed Kaloz&#039;s version, and I manually edited my config backup again to input the SSIDs it seems to like (it has no issue with example24.ca, but won&#039;t accept 24.example.ca), and pasted that into the /etc/config/wireless.</p><p>This seems to have worked. But if I edit the settings in the GUI, it breaks them again...</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you been able to fix this issue? I have a similar problem running trunk with a linksys E4200 v2.</p><p>The 5ghz interface works fine, but the 2.4 one won&#039;t come online after changing security settings.<br />Nothing but a factory reset seems to &quot;solve&quot; this.</p>									</div>
