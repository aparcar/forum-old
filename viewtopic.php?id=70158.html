					<p>I am re-planning my infrastructure and I was thinking about running openvpn on my routers instead of my hosts, but there is a problem. I want to use Boulder so I don&#039;t have to manage certs manually anymore. There is not really a way for me to run certbot directly on the router because it is a heavy python client. I could serve a file share off of the router and have another machine run certbot for it, but that is messy. Is there something else I can do?</p>									</div>
