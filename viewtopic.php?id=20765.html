					<p>Hi all</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up a veth configuration on my eth0.1 (WAN) port, but wasn&#039;t successful yet.<br />I have a WRT54GL with the latest firmware 8.09.1 and the 2.4 kernel.<br />My ISP is distributing 4 different IP-addresses to my account, that I want to use for multi-NAT. <br />For that I need 4 virtual nics with different mac-addresses on my wan port.<br />The IPs are distributed by a DHCP server located on a different LAN segment.</p><p>I installed the veth packet an tried the following:</p><p># create a new VETH device veth0 on eth0 with arbitrary mac-address:<br />vethd </p><p># set device up<br />ip link set dev veth0 up</p><p># create new bridge containing my wan port (eth0.1) and the virtual device<br />brctl addbr br-wan<br />brctl addif br0 eth0.1<br />brctl addif br0 veth0</p><p>Now when I&#039;m trying to obtain an ip-address on any of the two devices, I fail. Do anybody know the correct configuration?</p><p>Thank you<br />daboss</p>									</div>
