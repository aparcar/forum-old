					<p>Hello,</p><p>I use Openwrt (Attitude Adjustment 12.09) on a tp-link wdr-3600 router. It works fine, i&#039;ve managed to do everything i wanted so far. <br />In your opinion will openwrt be faster or are there any reasons to use a builded version from trunk?<br />My guess is, cause the kernel and some drivers are newer maybe there could be slight differences, but does it worth it?</p><p>Thanks! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>This cannot be answered across-the-board!</p><p>First there is the Linux kernel. Trunk uses a newer version, so <strong>possibly</strong> there were changes you would profit from.<br />Second there is OpenWrt: <strong>Possibly</strong> there were changes you would profit from. This includes simple updates of the software packages or entire patches for your hardware. <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/log/trunk?rev=37652">https://dev.openwrt.org/log/trunk?rev=37652</a></p><p>Edit: There definitely is a drawback: new version could break your configuration / setup!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kirschwasser</strong> on 5 Aug 2013, 14:15)</p>

					<p>I use both version alternatively and there is not much difference. The QoS change to codel was included in AA as patch to kernel 3.3.8, while it is built-in in kernel 3.5 onwards. That is perhaps the most significant kernel change between those versions.</p><p>If you are happy with AA 12.09, there is no major reason to change yet.</p><p>One factor against an update is that as trunk builds are sanpshots, you need to add all packages at the same time, as the packages compiled a week later might not be compatible. AA has a stable package download library, so it is much easier for a &quot;casual user&quot;.</p><p>If you compile Openwrt by yourself, then it is much easier with trunk. (But like Nilfred already said, a spare router can be handy, or at least a router with easy recovery from a bad firmware flash.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 6 Aug 2013, 10:33)</p>

					<p>For some reasons the&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openwrt#Release_History">Wikipedia Article on OpenWrt</a> contains more information then the OpenWrt wiki.<br />For the current Kernel version, quickest way would be to have a look in the ftp downloads directory (for your platform!): <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/">ar71xx Downloads</a>. Search for &quot;kernel&quot;. It the meta package for the Linux kernel included, e.g. &quot;kernel_3.10.4-1-675...&quot; Sometimes Kernel versions are different between platforms!</p><p>But I cannot tell you where to get <strong>more information</strong> about existing differences between <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/latest##stable.releases">OpenWrt current stable</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/latest#bleeding.edge">OpenWrt next</a>.</p><p>Only the developers know that, and I doubt anybody has the time and the will to answer such questions... you could try on IRC, but I would not.</p><p>You could look at the changes since the stable fork, but this misses the changes in the kernel. You would also have to look for changes in the packages upstream.<br />&nbsp; * E.g. OpenWrt says: &quot;update busybox package from version 1.19.1 to version 1.20.0&quot;. This tells you nothing about the changes inside. So then you have to go to busybox page, and see there, what has changed!</p><p>Sometimes there are changes, you would profit from big time. But that depends on what you are doing with your device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Example of a major change in OpenWrt is Luci2: that is <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/procd">procd</a>, </p><p>Personally I miss information about the introduction of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/architecture">Changes in OS architecture</a>.</p><p>At least there is some documentation about the (more or less) current status in OpenWrt trunk, but is missing information about features and interfaces, and also the timeline, and the plans for the future.</p><p>Then again, Lennart Poettering et al. have rewritten D-Bus to offer a better C Interface, so maybe procd isn&#039;t going to stay.
