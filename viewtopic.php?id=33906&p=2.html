					<p>Okay. So, I have bricked mine (tl-wr841n). I read this post, and got myself a dku-5 but it only has 3 wires (blue, red, orange). I found this pdf (<a href="http://www.neolics.com/pdfs/dku-5.pdf">http://www.neolics.com/pdfs/dku-5.pdf</a>), which says that the one with the highest voltage will be the tx (blue). The orange is ground, and that leaves the red to be rx. When I connect with this arrangement, it shows me a blank black screen. Any other combination gives a somewhat half-eligible and half-gibberish output, but either hangs my computer, or gives me a blue screen of death. </p><p>I went looking for a Ca42 (as it unbricked omiez&#039;s) in our local market, but couldn&#039;t find it. Because of my location and budget, internet shopping websites (eBay, Amazon, etc.) are out of the question.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, because I am a newbie to electronics and am completely lost.</p><br /><p>Edit: The blue wire gives out reading 3.5 volts, the red dances around from 0.24 to 0.28</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>g718669</strong> on 19 Aug 2013, 18:28)</p>

					<p>All great info AND if you have time and patience and are okay that after all is said and done you might still fail -- go for it.<br />FOR THE REST OF US -- Know that you can buy a new WR841N(D) for LESS than $20 on Amazon today.<br />There is also a similar DLink 615 that can be loaded with WRT.</p><p>I &quot;bricked&quot; mine yesterday - tried the various resets&nbsp; and finally ended up here....</p><p>NOW a question:&nbsp; Why not make WRT more resistant to bad or wrong version uploads? To interrupted uploads?</p><p>Simple stuff -- Checksum the would-be new image - and the image should contain identifiers saying which models it is intended for.&nbsp; Allow an override for the adventurous and/or foolish, but otherwise reject a &quot;bad&quot; image file.</p><p>Also,&nbsp; Leave some bootstrap loaded code untouched - a bootstrap that can communication via the Ethernet port.</p><p>That bootstrap will check whether a reset button is &quot;in&quot; - if so it will go to emergency mode - instead of booting the &quot;real&quot; router code.</p><p>These two items would make the upgrade process almost foolproof - plus there would always be a recovery path even if I was so foolish as to force a bad image.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hy</p><p>I&#039;m new, and my English is not perfect, hope you will understand:)</p><p>I have a TP- Link wr841N v8.2... from the stock firmware I went to openwrt (or superwrt, I don&#039;t remind that exactly.) It was slow and when I changed some setting, the connection was lost some times. </p><p>I think I deleted, or disabled the eth0 or what, where is listed the wifi in the menu, where I have to fill the ppp user and password to make a connection to the internet. </p><p>Sometimes it connects to the router by 192.168... sometimes not. Now I can&#039;t reach it.My second LED starts blinking two times, a little pause (1 second or 2), and again two blinks, pause, two blinks. Even when I power on, after reset... always blink this way, I can&#039;t tenet, tftp it on LAN WAN...now I have a USB 2.0 to UART TTL 6PIN Connector Module Serial Converter CP2102</p><p>The driver is installed for it, I have win 8.1 x64. I downloaded the putty, I connected the 3 pin, in the correctly to the pouters mainboard. On my USB module, there are two LEDs. One red, for the power, and one green, for data. There are ON, but when I power on the router, the data LED indicator on the USB turns off. I can&#039;t telnet the router. I changed my PCs IP to 192.168.1.2, the router is x.x.1.1, but nothing. On the puttys window, nothing happen. It&#039;s empty.Can somebody tells me what and how I have to do to reach it, and put it back in original? Or it&#039;s dead? I want to unbick it, but I don&#039;t now if the order is important, when I plug in the cables, when I open the apps on pc?
