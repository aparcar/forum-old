					<p>Okay we weeks back (I only had it for may be a month) I pretty much bricked my new shiny 1900AC by putting incorrect network settings. I honestly didn&#039;t know by putting incorrect settings can break something I mean that is for RED button in the back for right ? WRONG !</p><p>Back then I could not reset router for nothing. But something how I did after pressing Red butting for gazillion times, I still don&#039;t know how I did it. </p><p>This time it&#039;s worse. Same thing I only tried to get myu damn transmission to show OPEN on transmission-remote -pt command and look what I&#039;ve got ... damn brick again. But this time it&#039;s a lot worse I think.</p><p>Back when it happened for a first time when pressing reset button I saw POWER flashing fast so I knew that button did something.</p><p>This time around no matter how long I hold it NOTHING happens. Also when I switch unit on I see 2 solid lights. On Power and on eSATA. I don&#039;t even have eSATA connected why is it showing ?</p><p>So for the moment I am using backup router but only thing I can tell you is this. I mess with some network settings, nothing else and now reset button is not working, and when unit switched on I see 2 solid not flashing lights on Power and eSATA.</p><p>Please help.</p><p>My pc manually set to 192.168.1.2 and when I try to connect to router via 192.168.1.1 all I see is black screen with Powered by LuCI on top left in white letters .....</p><p>Please don&#039;t tell me I am screwed.</p><p>I also have Serial connector connected to pins but I NEVER got it to work with putty. Unit I have is Prolific USB to Serial Comm Port. I managed to get drivers that enabled it on my Windows 10 64bit machine. IT&#039;s PL2303HX based adapter.</p><p>I feel like an idiot by doing this crap twice, I man I love solving problems but this is brutal I can&#039;t do shit because reset button not working at all .....and I feel this Power + eSATA means something for you guys ......I only hope it&#039;s not RMA it to Linksys suggestion.</p><p>Please help guys.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xakep</strong> on 15 Feb 2016, 11:42)</p>
