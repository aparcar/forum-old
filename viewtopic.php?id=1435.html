					<p>OK. There are two easy ways to get started with building your own firmware images:</p><p>1) If you have the time and disk space, grab the OpenWrt source from our CVS server (see our Wiki for more information)<br />2) Grab my OpenWrt image builder from <a href="http://openwrt.inf.fh-brs.de/~nbd/gcc34/">http://openwrt.inf.fh-brs.de/~nbd/gcc34/</a>. You can use that to make new firmware images with a different set of packages (all precompiled).</p>									</div>
