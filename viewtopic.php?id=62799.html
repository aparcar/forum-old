If you capture on a host and not the router you might simply use wireshark for caprturing as well and cut out the tcpdump side-tour.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>zappe wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What I got was default (tos 0x0), low cost (tos 0x10), throughput (tos 0x8), low delay (tos 0x2,ECT(0)) and reliability (tos 0x4).

But be that as it may the idea would be to select one of the dscp patterns and filter on that. I would probably try tos 0x10... Or rather I would patch transmission to map the key words to more sensible DSCP values. Actually I would probably hardcode all as dscp 0x08 CS1/BK, as I would never want to give bit-torrent higher priority than default, but rather less priority... Also it would be great to do the same for UDP packets... But it seems that session.c will also accept a string like &quot;peer-socket-tos&quot;: &quot;0x20&quot; which should mark packets correctly as CS1/BK, have you tried that?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>zappe wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Do you think setting the value to low cost (tos 0x10), putting in your earlier string and turning off uTP would be the best way to go?

So the idea of my example was to steer the example pattern into the background band as well (assuming you want to de-prioretize bittorrent). I had not thought about the &quot;--tos Minimize-Delay&quot; which basically tries to honor very old applications, which honestly I would ignore completely, so comment this line out or steer it into 0x3... I think I would filter on DSCP values and not TOS, otherwise things will work differently if ECN markings come into play (note, I only assume that ECN bits might confuse iptables here I have not tested that). But first try &quot;peer-socket-tos&quot;: &quot;0x20&quot; which might work without the requirement to change simple.qos at all. (It will only mark out-going TCP packets, but if you disable uTP this should allow to test whether that reduced bit-torrent interference with your network. If it helps the next step might be to teach the same trick to uTP traffic as well. Marking incoming packets to also reduce interference on the downstream however is going to be much harder, as you can not simply trust that these packets come with sensible DSCP markings at all...) <br />Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

Often on a router NAT gets in the way, so it would be best to mark all packets at the source machine with the correct DSCP, in your case CS1. Now if the issue is that you do not fully trust that machine/software/user you might need to do the marking on the router. To avoid getting into NAT issues you cold try to do the marking on, say br-lan, as all egress packets from internal hosts need to pass br-lan... (ingress is a bit trickier as you need to classify at or before the shaper, so you will need to solve the NAT to internal host IP mapping there).</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
