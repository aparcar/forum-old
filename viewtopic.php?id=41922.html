					<p>Im new on OpenWRT. I want to use the Arduino and WR703N as a wireless client. So that, I need to send &quot;HTTP Get or Post requests&quot; to my web server from Arduino over WR703N WiFi. I will insert sensor data to database table. Schematic is belown:</p><p>Sensor-&gt;Arduino-&gt;WR703N-&gt;WiFi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WiFi-&gt;Web Server (JSP, PHP, ASP or any CGI )-&gt;Database</p>									</div>

					<p>What works may depend on the type of usb/serial dongle you have.&nbsp; Today I plugged a CH340 serial dongle into a ramips device, and it wasn&#039;t recognized at all.&nbsp; I installed kmod-usb-ochi and it was recognized.&nbsp; It worked with picocom, but did not work with the script I quoted above.</p><p>This was baffling.&nbsp; I replaced the CH340 device with a CP2102 device.&nbsp; That worked without the ohci module, and the script worked without problems.&nbsp; I assume this is a driver issue, but I have no idea what the problem can be.</p><p>I have encountered the problem before of a serial usb device working in picocom but not in lua or with a script, and have replaced the device thinking that it was somehow faulty--it may just be the ChipHead driver.</p>									</div>
