					<p>I am using a Designated Driver based custom build of OpenWRT, and I trying to scan for a wireless network from LuCI while connected to the wireless adapter.</p><p>hardware: gateworks ventana board, DHXA-222 mini PCIe wireless card</p><p>When I run `iwtest wlan0 scan`, I am able to see the utility report all the wireless networks within range. However, the current network is then torn down when scan completes. This causes a problem when running the scan command from LuCI because the dynamic content is lost when the network connection is severed.</p><p>Questions:<br />1) Should I expect the wireless network to be lost when performing a scan? <br />2) If so, Lua supports writing to disk, so it seems that caching the scan content to disk may make the most sense, agreed? or is there a better way to address this within the LuCI framework?</p><p>Note when connecting to the wired network card, the page is served as expected. Unfortunately, this isn&#039;t an option for the final solution</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi ssparks,</p><p>1)Based on your specs, you should be just fine.<br />2) There are always alternatives, but if you can cache the scan content to disk that will work. </p><p>Hope that helps, good luck and please report back on how it turns out.</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK, during a scan the radio has to hop from channel to channel trying to find all access points; I think it is normal that you lose connection to that device during the scan.</p>									</div>

					<p>No by client I mean the laptop or whatever you are connecting with.&nbsp; The AP doesn&#039;t deliberately drop anything.&nbsp; It will go off the air for a few seconds while scanning.&nbsp; Most clients wait some time for it to come back before dropping the connection, since the same situation occurs if you walk out of range or experience interference.</p><p>That &quot;join&quot; button can put you through a world of problems.&nbsp; If you need a client interface, manually configure it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 13 Feb 2018, 19:23)</p>
