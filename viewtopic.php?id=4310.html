					<p>*** Beat&#039;n down humble man ****<br />I am stuck and can&#039;t find out how to stop my router from being pinged (replying to a ping).&nbsp; I have searched the usual, google, fourms, how to&#039;s and could find nothing on where or how to do this.&nbsp; Any help pointing me in the right direction would be appreciated.&nbsp; I would have thought that this would be setup by default.&nbsp; I only found out that this was not the default when I noticed someone trying to brute force an administrator password into my FTP server. I wondered why this never happened before.&nbsp; I then realized that I could ping the WRT which made it easy for a person in France (That is where the trace ended) to find my personal FTP server and try to turn it into a warez server.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks to all:&nbsp; I tried the following on WHITE RUSSIAN (RC4) in firewall.user:<br />iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP -&gt; This did not work for me.&nbsp; The WAN still responded to ICMP ping.<br />iptables -A input_rule -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP -&gt;&nbsp; This did work (WAN does NOT respond to a ICMP ping) and also allows me to still ping the NIC&#039;s on the LAN.<br />iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP -&gt; I did not try this one with or without the $WAN as mentioned in previous posts.</p><p>Is there a benifit to using the input_rule or prerouting_rule?&nbsp; Assuming that these both should work, I was just wondering if I should use one over the other.</p>									</div>

					<p>MrMengo, I&#039;m wondering the same thing as I like to optimize for best efficiency.&nbsp; e.g. this may affect ping flood response on the system.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of data flow and perhaps mine using table &quot;nat&quot; lacks efficiency as it has to go deeper.</p><p>Also, while you can ping your LAN NICs can they ping the router&#039;s LAN address?&nbsp; This is what I meant to preserve.&nbsp; I found a similar rule to yours did kill LAN ping response, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>The input_rule is the right place, as this rule only applies to packages directed at the router (yes, -i $WAN is necessary).</p><p>Images that show the dataflow:<br /><a href="http://iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/images/tables_traverse.jpg">http://iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/ … averse.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://www.shorewall.net/images/Netfilter.png">http://www.shorewall.net/images/Netfilter.png</a></p><p>If you want to understand how netfilter and the iptables tool work, I can recommend reading the Iptables Tutorial by Oskar Andreasson while keeping your S45firewall and firewall.user files in reach for comparison.</p>									</div>
