					<p>I have several cheap devices which I plan to use as access points (usr5451 for example). These low-budget devices come with only ONE RJ45 socket LAN port. I&nbsp; want to connect the AP to the network through the LAN socket and connect devices through the AP wifi.</p><p>My problem is, each AP must also provide one wired connection (to Dreambox sat receiver), which means I need two RJ45 sockets on each device.</p><p>Is such a mod possible? It would probably depend on the LAN controller chip used in each device. has anyone done such modding?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can buy a 10/100 Mbps 5-port switch to connect to the USR5451 or look for an inexpensive new router.&nbsp; Frankly speaking, I would rather do the later to save $$$.</p>									</div>

					<p>Assuming that the SoC has spare unused ports; yes, that would be possible. However, you need a bit more than just a simple connector, wire, and solder. You need an Ethernet driver chip (basically a power amp); and if I remember right, a few capacitors.</p><p>You would most likely be better off grabbing some cheap $10 5-port switches.<br /><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704026">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a â€¦ 6833704026</a></p><p>V/r,<br />Conjur</p>									</div>
