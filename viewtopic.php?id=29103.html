					<p>Hi,<br />I want to compile my own version of OpenWRT for printserver Edimax PS3205U (and use it as a robot&#039;s brain ;-)). It&#039;s basicaly the same hardware as BR-6104KP, only without switch ports and with 2 usb and 1 LPT.</p><p>I downloaded backfire from svn (svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire), installed all dependencies, configured openwrt (make menuconfig) as well as kernel (make kernel_menuconfig). BUT, I get no bin-image. On the internet everybode writes, that I can simply run &quot;make&quot;, but after (successful) make, in the &quot;bin/adm5120&quot; directory is only packages directory and files: openwrt-adm5120-router_le-rootfs.tar.gz and OpenWrt-Toolchain-adm5120-for-mipsel-gcc-4.3.3+cs_uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2 -- no bin (neither webui.bin nor xmodem.bin)</p><p>What did I wrong? Help me please :-). I work on it 2 days and I am comming crazy ;-).</p><p>Have a nice day, everybody!</p>									</div>
