					<p>AFAIK Atheros purchased hard IP from MIPS, so in contrary to companies purchasing soft IPs, Atheros does/did not rename the CPU names.</p><p>AR7242 is a SoC and so is the AR9132.</p><p>As to the differences between the two, I really think Atheros should feel responsible to document them. ;-)</p><p>And as to TP-Link&#039;s choices in Chips for their devices, you should ask TP-Link. ;-)</p>									</div>
