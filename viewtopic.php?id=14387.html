					<p>Iâ€™ve got a problem with the setup of my dwl-7100ap (running r10217) that I canâ€™t seem to solve or understand why it is happening! The thing is that broadcasts donâ€™t get forwarded through the AP the way they should so stuff like dhcp and arp does not work.</p><p>Iâ€™ve got a notebook that I want to connect wirelessly to my network (and the network setup as a whole is quite simple). On the â€œwiredâ€ -side I got a broadband router that also acts as dhcp-server for my network and a linux-server that exports disk through samba among other things. The dwl-7100ap has one Ethernet port that is connected to the wired lan and two wireless networks (2.4GHz and 5GHz) that are all bridged together in a bridge to keep the same subnet on both wired and wireless networks. (Btw everything worked OK before I installed OpenWrt on the AP)<br />The wireless association (with WPA) works so I get a working link between the client and the AP, but broadcasts don&#039;t get forwarded as they should so the clients dhcp-requests never reaches the dhcp-server and no&nbsp; arp-requests get through from either side etc so no actual IP-traffic can take place.</p><p>Now hereâ€™s the thing that I find strange; according to iptables â€“L â€“v no packets get dropped due to firewall rules and brctl shows that the bridge is setup as it is supposed to. AND if I enter a static IP on the client and manually add the mac-adresses in the arp-tables on the machines ping, ssh etc works! So â€œpoint to pointâ€&nbsp; IP-traffic work, itâ€™s just broadcasts that get lost?</p><p>Does anyone have an idea what might be wrong?</p>									</div>
