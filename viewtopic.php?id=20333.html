					<p>I have a WRT54G moded with 2G SD card, It is running very good with only one problem, some of my init scripts won&#039;t run at boot up. scripts like qos-script, tinyproxy, and asterisk. From the log of asterisk, looks like it is related to SD mount not being ready at the time the script is running, my asterisk is installed in sd partition, same as the tinyproxy, but qos-script is installed in the flash, it too won&#039;t start at boot. Any suggestion on how to cope with this problem? Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>You may try to customize the start level of your sd mount script. For my WRT54GS V1.1, I had to set S48 to my bootext mounting script. Otherwise, the default S40network script would not run. BTW, I am using 7.09, not 8.09.</p>									</div>

					<p>I use fstab to mount the SD card. I will try your suggestion when I have chance. Is there a way to log the boot processes to see what is going on with this kind of failed script execution?</p>									</div>
