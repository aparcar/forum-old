					<p>Hi,</p><p>Can someone please point me to a guide to configure OpenWRT as an OpenVPN client. Preferably with screenshots of how Luci should look. I&#039;ve read several articles on the wiki, but most of them refer to an obsolete luci openvpn package, or talk about configuring a VPN server instead of client. Sometimes a new interface needs to be created, sometimes just some firewall rules... I&#039;m lost.</p><p>I&#039;d like to use Mullvad as a VPN provider. I have uploaded the key, conf, ovpn and crt files to root. </p><p>I would also like to only assign one LAN IP address to the VPN, the other IP&#039;s should not use the VPN. Is that possible?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nikotine</strong> on 21 Mar 2013, 01:21)</p>

					<p>So I&#039;ve been messing around and have a VPN connection running!<br />All wiki&#039;s or how-to&#039;s I found were just utter crap, so for future reference and anyone else having trouble with it, this is what I did:</p><p>- Install the OpenVPN package<br />- upload your key, conf and crt files to /etc/openvpn<br />- If needed, edit the conf file to your liking<br />- SSH into your OpenWRT using putty (root) and cd into /etc/openvpn<br />- openvpn --config mullvad.conf (replace with your conf file name)<br />- If you get the message &quot;Initialization Sequence Completed&quot;, openvpn is running, but you&#039;ll notice you don&#039;t have internet access<br />- Go to Network &gt; Interfaces and make a new Interface<br />- Name it vpn_interface, choose protocol &#039;unmanaged&#039; and select tun0 as the covered interface (this one&#039;s new after you&#039;ve started openvpn)<br />- Assign this interface to the wan firewall zone<br />- We want openvpn to start when the router boots, so go to System &gt; Startup and at the bottom put this<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Put your custom commands here that should be executed once
# the system init finished. By default this file does nothing.

/usr/sbin/openvpn --cd /etc/openvpn --daemon --config /etc/openvpn/mullvad.conf &amp;

exit 0</code></pre></div><p>and hit submit.<br />All of the guides I found had different rc.local scripts. This is the only one that works.<br />- reboot the router, the VPN will connect, you will have internet access, check your ip at <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/.">http://whatismyipaddress.com/.</a></p><p>My interfaces look like this:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img546.imageshack.us/img546/4857/interfaces.png" alt="http://img546.imageshack.us/img546/4857/interfaces.png" /></span></p><p>My firewall looks like this:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img203/9541/firewall.png" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img203/9541/firewall.png" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nikotine</strong> on 21 Mar 2013, 01:43)</p>
