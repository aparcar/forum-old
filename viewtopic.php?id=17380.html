					<p>hello everyone. So I have a fon2100 that had ddwrt on it but was kind of buggy so I decided to just flash it to openwrt. I followed the upgrading instructions on the fon page on the openwrt wiki (upgrading openwrt from openwrt). But when I flashed the vmlinux part it finished but it immediately disconnected and I can&#039;t get it&#039;s ip... I haven&#039;t rebooted it yet (dsconnecting power) and all the lights are solid green. </p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>
