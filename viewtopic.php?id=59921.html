					<p>Hello!<br />I am trying to port from source code some app to OpenWrt. And I encountered a problem with glib2 library. Even the simplest HelloWorld program does not run if it is simply linked with libgobject-2.0.so or libgio-2.0.so shared libraries (with keys -lgobject-2.0 or -lgio-2.0). Attempt to run such app produces the errors:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./&lt;&lt;app name&gt;&gt;: symbol &#039;__stack_chk_guard&#039;: can&#039;t resolve symbol
./ &lt;&lt;app name&gt;&gt;: symbol &#039;__stack_chk_fail&#039;: can&#039;t resolve symbol</code></pre></div><p>It is strange but these functions are not used nor in the sources nor in symbolsâ€™ tables of app and libraries.<br />It occurs only with libgobject-2.0.so and libgio-2.0.so, but with libglib-2.0.so, libgmodule-2.0.so and libgthread-2.0.so HelloWorld works normally.<br />I tried both downloaded from repos and manually compiled versions of glib2.<br />What is the matter?</p>									</div>
