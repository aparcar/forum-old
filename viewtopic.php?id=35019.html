					<p>Hi all,</p><p>My first post here, and yes I am a total noob with this, I have joined the site because I am in need of some help, I purchased 2 DWL-2100AP Ver.A2 off eBay a little while ago, these units were said to be factory refurbished and I have just found a big problem with them, they have identical MAC Addresses in them and not the ones indicated on the bottoms of the units, because of this I cannot use them together on my network as the router sees them both as being the same and blocks everything.</p><p>I found this forum while searching for a way to change their MAC Addresses back to the ones indicated on the bottom of their cases, I know this forum mainly deals with hacking the DWL-2100AP but all I am really seeking is some help to change the MAC on these 2 devices, I have constructed myself a Wiggler JTAG as I read it can be used on them and I have found where to solder it all in, but I need help with the dumping and flashing of the Bootloader on these devices.</p><p>I am assuming the plan would be is to dump the Bootloader from the ATMEL AT49BV322A Flash Chips and edit the MAC&#039;s in a Hex Editor program then reflash the Bootloader into the devices with their new MAC&#039;s, I know this sounds simple and it probably is but I have never attempted this before and would not know where to start on the Software needed and procedure side of things to do this so if anyone has some advice I would very much appreciate it, thank you for reading and have a great day.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Kevin</p>									</div>

					<p>Success, have just changed the MAC, I used a different PC to telnet into it and it worked no problem, will just leave the other one that I cannot downgrade because they both now have different MAC&#039;s so they should work in harmony (fingers crossed), thank you very much for the help its very much appreciated.</p>									</div>
