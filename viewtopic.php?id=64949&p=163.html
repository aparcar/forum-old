					<p>Hey guys.<br />So i&#039;ve just spend the evenning trying to understand why they advise the device to be open source having proprietary wifi drivers.<br />I would like to have at least some documentation so we can do a GitHub project for a good and reliable driver.<br />I did contact marvell and linksys, one at the time.<br />I would really believe that if a lot of their costumers complain that they&#039;re not happy with this situation they will do something about it. Its been years since the product is out and the wifi never worked good. start making some noise, it will not hurt.<br />I know that there&#039;s a guy responsible for the project hired by linksys or whatever in github, but it&#039;s not enought, at least some documentation so we can make this device reliable and work along with him, or make another project.<br />Mail to marvell:<br />&quot;So, as you might be aware, linksys WRT3200ACM uses your 88W8964 chipset, which is a good thing. But Linksys advertise that the WRT3200ACM is opensource with all the big letters everywhere they sell it. Although i can&#039;t seem to find firmware source for the 88W8964 to build a good openWRT driver(the one active at the moment doesn&#039;t work and crashes all the time).<br />I&#039;m not sure what license is your firmware under, but if linksys is selling this product embedded in their routers i hope it is really opensource.<br />Would you mind sendind the sources file to me? <br />If the source files arent possible, i would like at least the documentation of the firmware so i&#039;m able to at least make the driver work in opensource software. If none of the above is possible i would like to know why. Thanks.&quot;<br />Btw the 2.4Ghz should give 600mbs, why am i only getting 50mbs out of it?<br />Is there a limitation somwhere in the software?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pirretub</strong> on 25 Nov 2017, 02:09)</p>

No response anymore and all connections break down on all clients. I thought maybe this could be related to the option &#039;Enable SYN-flood protection&#039; which was enabled by default, but deactivating it didnt change anything actually. A normal small package ping wouldnt cause this issue (ping 8.8.8.8 -I tun0).</p></blockquote></div><p>Had the same issues with VPN. Iptables mods are messing things arround.<br />There are 3 iptables packages, just leave the stock iptables and it will work.<br />I&#039;ve tried everything, but even well configured it wouldn&#039;t go, after i&#039;ve only left iptables it did work 5*<br />Btw just uninstall the packages before configuring anything.<br />So uninstall those two iptables mods, the tqops or something and the other one. Leave the stock one and configure the firewall proprely. Make a iptables script so it wount leak if the tun0 is down. NordVPN has a good explaination on their site, with leak protections and everything and it will work with any OVPN. <br />Add &quot;log /tmp/ovpn.log&quot; to your config file and just cat it to debug aftewards. You&#039;ll be able to know, TLS handshake usually fails with the Iptables mods on there. Not sure why.&nbsp; Other than tha some options don&#039;t work, like block-outside-dns and a lot of people try it in OpenWRT lol.<br />Btw feel free to add a line to the config:&quot;engine cryptodev&quot; you&#039;ll be happy with it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Good luck <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p></blockquote></div><p>1. I tried engine cryptodev before, it does nothing, the badnwidth is about 70mbit/s with or without it<br />2. I need iptables-mod-ipopt, because I am using mangle to filter stuff, and it worked before in the past, also kmod-ipt-conntrack-extra for owner flag.<br />3. to stop vpn leaks you just have to add a lan -&gt; wan reject rule in Luci in the end thats all.<br />4. nope. I have no problems no TLS handshake issues, no disconnects. So this problem totally is not related to your problem. I am running OpenVPN in a screen window, and I can easily monitor the output there. The VPN connection never drops nor reconnects or has TLS handshake issues.</p><p>Is there a way to test to deactivate the modules without removing them first?</p></blockquote></div><p>1-Sure Bandwith will be the same as the dual core cpu ensures it, but the load on the cpu is lower. At least in mine.<br />2-Well if you need them give them a try one at the time.<br />3-You&#039;re totally right.<br />4-then its not indeed what i understood.<br />Not sure if there is a init.d for stop, just check for it. If there isnt, i would clean the image(the two extra modules mentioned in 2)and configure the vpn without the iptables extras make sure that was working, then backup those configs. After that if you want to test with the modules everything in place, just load the backup onto a new flashed complete image with all the modules. Otherwise you might just do the same and get the same .ipks somewhere and install them aftewards one at the time, so you can debug the problem.It might not even be the modules(but i would start here personally), route configs might be messed up or something, i guess you&#039;ll have to try it and check for the problem or provide additional info so somebody can help.<br />Hope it helps something.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pirretub</strong> on 26 Nov 2017, 02:39)</p>

					<p>No. The 70mbit is already the cap, by the CPU. OpenVPN has cpu0 or 1 capped at 100% at around 70mbit/s, regardless if you put cryptodev in the config or not on this model. I am wondering whats causing this behavior: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SIy1SOH.png">https://i.imgur.com/SIy1SOH.png</a> not sure if it is related, but it looks like it. The connection with the VPN server stays, but the routing doesnt work anymore (randomly) and leads to timeout on the clients. I have looked on the OpenVPN output with a debug value of 7. It reads/writes to the socket, but it&#039;s somehow blocked by the router so the problem seems to be with the NAT (iptables) of this rom. Already open connections also will work on the clients, but no new connections anymore after this happens. Eventually it will timeout though and work again, but this seems to be the TCP timeout value.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 26 Nov 2017, 02:42)</p>

I migh have missed that.<br />What are you saying? That one of the CPU&#039;s is always at 100 and the other is whatever is needed to top the connection?<br />cipher AES-256-CBC, auth SHA512, using cryptodev, without it goes up, but not by much - I&#039;m topping my connection at 93mbit/s (and my connection is 100) and not even using 30%(at least that&#039;s what &quot;top&quot; says, 27percent load at full blast) of the CPU here... Without cryptodev i do get 7percent difference. Unless i&#039;m not getting some information. I&#039;m not sure but that&#039;s what i&#039;m getting here.<br />Yes, as i refered i did have exactly the same problem untill i removed those modules and made the iptables rules... <br />Not sure why, but removing it helped. <br />Just cat the firewall file and let me take a look maybe i can help? Also cat rt_tables or route and maybe trace a packet? Also cat the OVPN log. First we gotta check that the router traffic is going really throught the VPN. Then think about the rules for the clients to use it over lan.<br />Maybe this is a little offtopic here in the builds thread, if that&#039;s the case i&#039;m sorry.<br />Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pirretub</strong> on 26 Nov 2017, 03:19)</p>
