					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a MR3020 with 4MB flash that I want to upgrade to a 16MB. I also have a dominoPi with the SPI/JTAG cape that I would like to use as a programmer for my 16MB flash chip. I will use flashrom to program the SPI.</p><p>I have a question though, as all the procedures here are quite old. I have already upgraded the u-boot with pepe2k&#039;s modded one. I made a dump of all partitions: u-boot (mtd0) -128kb (which I suppose is the u-boot + data partition). The art partition and the firmware one.</p><p>What would be the proper way to create a 16MB flash image from here on?</p><p>Should I create an empty 16MB file and cat u-boot, firmware and art in it and then flash. Should I first compile an image for MR3020 that is 16MB in size and then cat u-boot, firmware and art in the empty file?</p><br /><p>I&#039;m a bit lost here, ao any help would be appreciated. I can alao try using the parallel connected flash chips with the CS jumper, but I don&#039;t feel that much comfortable doing that through u-boot and would prefer the SPI flashing through the programmer</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ilf</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 13:20)</p>

Prepare 16 MB empty bin file, filled with 0xFF.<br />2. Put:<br />- dump of the U-Boot image (128 KB) at offset 0x0<br />- OpenWrt/LEDE firmware (sysupgrade or factory, it doesn&#039;t matter) at offset 0x20000<br />- dump of ART (64 KB) in last sector (for 16 MB FLASH it will be at offset 0xFF0000)<br />3. Solder new FLASH chip on PCB.<br />4. Drink beer.</p>									</div>
