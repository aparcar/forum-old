					<p>An asterisk on a port inside a vlan definition means, that this is the default vlan on that port, and untagged packets belong to that vlan.<br />Specifing more than one asterisk for the same port on different vlans is not useful, and I don&#039;t know what are the consequences of that. Maybe the whole vlan definition could be ignored, the possiblities are endless ;-)</p><p>Cisco equipment does not support a vlan 0, if you want to communicate with cisco hardware, do not use vlan 0.</p><p>If you don&#039;t communicate via a trunked port to cisco (or other) hardware, vlan numbers are inside your linux device only, and hence irrelevant to the cisco hardware.<br />If you want to have a trunked port, you should specify the letter &quot;t&quot; (for tagged) following the port number on the vlan definition.</p><p>The default is &quot;t&quot;agged for the cpu port (usually 5), and &quot;u&quot;ntagged for all other ports.<br />Since you did not specify &quot;t&quot; with vlan506, it would be not a trunked port, and your cisco hardware would never see any vlan information.</p><p>In my opinion, a trunked port should have an asterisk in exactly one vlan definition, and a &quot;t&quot; on the remaining vlan definitions.</p><p>Restrictions of VLAN 0 to 15 on a broadcom switch are correct, if you want shared/common vlans on both your router and a cisco device, stay within vlan1 to vlan15.<br />Additionally you should not use the default vlan as the management vlan on your cisco device (see cisco docs).</p><p>I hope this helps a little bit...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MMCM</strong> on 16 Apr 2008, 14:47)</p>
