					<p>I want to be able to access the data of MACs that are listened from a Wi-Fi access point (TP Link) in order to register them in a MySql database. My first idea is to access through the PHP Telnet library to the Access Point command line to perform the queries. I understand that TP-Link works on OpenWRT, but I do not know how to perform the data queries: <br />- MAC within reach of the Access Point (even if they are not connected as clients) <br />- MAC connected to the Wifi Access Point. <br />Any guidance on how to tackle the problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>The wifi driver doesn&#039;t keep any list of stations that are not connected or trying to connect to your AP.&nbsp; In order to see those, you need to open a monitor mode interface and parse the results with something like airodump.</p>									</div>
