					<p>Dont listen to me until you confirm<br />I remember about a year ago flashing a 740 V2 with 740 V1 file cause DD-WRT didn&#039;t have a file for V2 then, I don&#039;t read today what I read then, but I remember it said V 1&amp;2 use same file, look at the picture on their webrevert they use only one file for both. <br /><a href="http://postimg.org/image/ygkxlv9e3/full/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s1.postimg.org/hg21d6wcv/image.jpg" alt="http://s1.postimg.org/hg21d6wcv/image.jpg" /></span></a><br /><a href="http://postimage.org/index.php?lang=spanish">imagen jpg</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t be 100% sure, I was using BB and my TL-WR740N v2.1 was identified as TL-WR741ND<br />I try CC but can&#039;t have a working Luci (not enough space ?) <br />I try to downgrade to BB but without Luci I have to use mtd command, and some post tell me take care of boot part of the file.</p><p>Finally I go back to tp-link firmware using revert file from dd-wrt: exactly the one you point @danymarc<br />(something like cd /tmp ; mv wr740nv1_v2_webrevert.bin tp-link.bin ; mtd -r write /tmp/tp-link.bin firmware) <br />the main problem when you try to update to openwrt coming from tp-link firmware is file check give error code 18005<br />some file can pass this check and other not, I remember 2 years ago I face this problem I take a basic AA file somewhere on the forum,<br />after that next file to update was fine.</p><br /><p>Good day,<br />Laurent.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just read something that apparently I missed earlier. There is a line on the tl-wr740n openwrt support page, under the &quot;Specific Install Notes&quot; section, which says the following:</p><p>&quot;The trunk WR740n hardware v1 image works unmodified and it can be flashed through the stock TP-Link web interface (another file exists for version 3). <strong>The v1 file was also successfully tested on hardware version 2.5.</strong>&quot;</p><p>Is this correct? But at the moment the trunk version is CC /if I am not mistaken/ and probably that line was written for earlier OpenWRT releases, perhaps AA or BB, or even earlier. So maybe the current trunk release isn&#039;t a good idea but BB might work? The support page last modification date is &quot;2015/06/08 12:22&quot; but that doesn&#039;t mean it was revised too.</p><p>@danymarc, your logic is something along the lines of this: &quot;If DD-WRT has single image for both v1 and v2 hardware, then perhaps OpenWRT v1 image should also support v2 hardware&quot;. Am I following you?</p>									</div>

					<p>@danymarc, I suppose the mtd utility doesn&#039;t care what data it writes to the non-volatile memory. And the dd-wrt revert image is actually already trimmed stock image, and that is why it just magically works.</p>									</div>
