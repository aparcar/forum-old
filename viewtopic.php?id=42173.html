					<p>Hi to all,</p><p>So I managed to have ddns updates installed as explained in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ddns.client">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ddns.client</a></p><p>But when using DNSoMatic and &quot;source&quot; = URL = <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.com/">http://checkip.dyndns.com/</a><br />It doesn&#039;t stop repeating updates! I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll be banned because of hammering too much the servers</p><p>I tried to debug by running &quot;/usr/lib/ddns/dynamic_dns_updater.sh myddns&quot; and it clears verboses:<br />&quot;<br />current system ip = 85.241.x.x<br />registered domain ip =<br />&quot;</p><p>I&#039;m a newbie trying to read the &quot;dynamic_dns_updater.sh&quot; code <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />but how the hell is &quot;registered_ip&quot;&nbsp; being found to compute if it needs or not an update?</p><p>machine is a wr703n running 12.09-rc1 , and it&#039;s behind another router. Therefore I guess it can only figure out external ip with help of web service, right?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>To be absolutely sure, when your script executes, you can set to cron job to run every 2 hours, which will update your ip without help of any third-party script:</p><p>vi /etc/crontabs/root<br />23 */2 * * * wget http://user:pass@members.dyndns.org/nic/update?hostname=mydomain</p><p>/etc/init.d/cron start<br />/etc/init.d/cron enable</p><p>Same it works with no-ip, which is free, dyndns isn&#039;t anymore, so make your choice, if you want to pay for something that is free elsewhere.

					<p>Danke Zandhaas!</p><p>I wouldn&#039;t not have the time/trouble to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; that script. But you point it what very precisely.<br />It&#039;s not optimal, but it&#039;s solved my problem...</p><p>Especially because my WAN wouldn&#039;t never be the external IP, because of being behind another machine and subnet.</p><p>Now, this thread can stay open mainly for that extra of having a easy config via Luci.</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>
