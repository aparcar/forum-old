					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I&#039;m searching about why only 13 channels available on 2.4Ghz and why we could switch to 5Ghz.</p><p>While searching, I found 2.4Ghz devices can create more channels than 13 channels. It is not something compareable with 5ghz but it&#039;s still very good while we have bunch of devices still can only operate at 2.4Ghz.</p><p>Like their name, these devices can only opreate at 2.4Ghz, between 2400Mhz and 2500Mhz. Every channel has 22Mhz bandwidth. We can choose anything in 2400 and 2500.</p><p>There are a standart about where are those channels are, it&#039;s shown below:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg/1000px-2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg.png" alt="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg/1000px-2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg.png" /></span></p><p>As you noticed, there are 13 channels, which sepearated with 5Mhz gap between them to block interference. (Igrone channel 14, it&#039;s only available to 802.11b)</p><p>But why there are no 2477, 2482 and 2487 a.k.a. 14, 15 and 16? Let&#039;s discuss about this. And if it turns good, include support for these channels on OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>afaik mostly the problem is law.</p><p>plus, on openwrt there are problems even to use channel 13 in EU without an HACK, so you will never see &quot;strange&quot; channels supported imho.</p><p>you can google about dd-wrt superchannel, if you really think it&#039;s useful.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 25 Dec 2013, 17:05)</p>

					<p>Which EU country is this? Only US has a law about that, limits our devices to 2,400–2,483.5 MHz. Rest of the world allows this. Also even we are on US, I don&#039;t think we are going to jail for using these channels.</p><p>edit: Just saw your edit. Can we implement this function to openwrt? It&#039;s really useful.</p>									</div>

Of course there are more users using wi-fi and because of that, they shoud be switch to different frequency.

We can copy channel locations (and some code if that&#039;s not violate our license terms) from DD-WRT. What about support on non-embedded systems? Can my laptop connect these &quot;extra&quot; channels?</p>									</div>
