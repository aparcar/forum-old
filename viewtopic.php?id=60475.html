					<p>Hi, friend bought one of these and bricked it trying to install dd-wrt as the dd-wrt database says they have a version for it. It turns out TP-Link made an Atheros based v1 for the Chinese market (I think) and then released an International or European version with a Broadcom but - idiotically - still using the TL-WR840N-V1 details. DUH!. </p><p>The dd-wrt version is obviously for the Atheros. A typical dd-wrt attitude of not warning of the possibility of this issue and bricking the Broadcom does not help at all.</p><p>I have found some postings here and other sites mentioning they were able to get a version of OpenWrt installed, but the links to the OW-download are all broken.</p><p>So, what&#039;s the situation? I opened it up and it does have Broadcom chip in it.</p><p>Is there a version of OW that I can put on it?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
