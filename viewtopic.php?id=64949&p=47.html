Keep in mind, when the new wifi driver is release there will probably be a few bugs to work out.</p><p>If you can get the 3200acm, I recommend one, but keep the 1900ac as your regular workhorse until the wifi driver is completed. </p><p>As of yesterday this was a comment from a Linksys developer who is working on the new 3200acm driver --</p><p>&quot;Re-architecture is done. Adding support for the same firmware used by stock firmware to this new architecture now.&quot; </p><p>So, it probably won&#039;t be too much longer before wifi is working on the 3200.</p><p>**EDIT**</p><p>One other thing worth mentioning... If you need switch configurations on the 3200acm, that may not be working right now. There are plans to get it working with the new chipset, but there may be delays.</p><p>another **EDIT**</p><p>There is a separate flash warning I have issued for the 3200acm. After flashing to LEDE from the stock firmware, to flash again, you will probably need to use the USB/TTL method. In other words, the GUI and sysupgrade may be broke. Others have noticed the same issue, and someone is probably working on a fix.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 23 Feb 2017, 00:40)</p>

					<p>Agree about keeping the Linksys firmware available. Makes life easier switching between different builds. I have at times installed cybrnook, davidc502, Gargoyle, and DD-WRT. Would not have been as easy switching between these builds if I had not kept the stock partition available. The /usr/sbin/bootTaOther.sh is a nice touch in cybrnook&#039;s builds.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 25 Feb 2017, 00:50)</p>
