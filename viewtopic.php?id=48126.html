					<p>hello!</p><p>i&#039;ve been thinking about expanding my openwrt router with external root fs. while reviewing all available options i found non actually meet my requirements.</p><p>currently here is no flexible, extensible and automated way to do so. what i&#039;d like to see is almost what we have here but with some additions.</p><p>i do have build scripts. my scripts can flush the software with my personal settings, ISP params, wifi password and this bin can automatically flushed to the router using ssh &amp;&amp; sysupgrade.</p><p>right now i unable to do all steps without additional ssh in router interactions. which is my feature request.</p><p>i&#039;m looking for simple way to create print server with full feature cups installed. to do so i need about 100M of external usb drive space. which is not a problem at present days (you can have 2GB use for almost free).</p><p>so. it would be nice to have an option within a opewrt build script system which can help you to choose where build packages are going.</p><p>for example you can select cups packages, ghostscript, hplip, etc.. to goes on a external drive as separate tar.gz or squashfs which can be installed automatically using ssh scripts which goes to the router by install script.</p><p>by the way. you can see my current work (based on great effort of openwrt guys) at <a href="https://github.com/axet/openwrt-tl-wr842nd-v2">https://github.com/axet/openwrt-tl-wr842nd-v2</a></p>									</div>
