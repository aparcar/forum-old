					<p>I am working on a router design that uses a cheap router (TP-LINK TL741ND-V1 for $24) that I can use as a VPN access device where the LAN is a private subnet whose traffic is routed through openvpn to a remote server. The openvpn public connection, dns and admin access are the only traffic allowed through the WAN on the router. Nothing plugged into the LAN ports would be allowed to access the public internet and the reverse.</p><p>Some questions for those that have experience with the firewall configuration on openwrt:</p><p>1) Is it possible to turn off the NAT function as the openvpn, dns and admin access would be bound to the public ip and not use NAT? If so, is it as simple as unchecking the masquerading check box in the firewall configuration?</p><p>2) Can I define a zone called VPN and add the tun interface created by openvpn to it? </p><p>3) I want the traffic to/from the LAN to be routed through the VPN and out the WAN interface. Am I going to be dealing with iptables rules here or is there some provision in the luci-app-openvpn package?</p><p>Has this already been done by anybody? If so some pointers would save me a lot of head-banging.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Perazim</p>									</div>
