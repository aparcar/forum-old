					<p>I am using Linksys wrt1900ac, flashed with operwrt. I can access the luci via the wrt1900ac&#039;s LAN 192.168.1.1. I connected the internet port of wrt1900ac to my old router and hope to access the wrt1900ac luci via my macbook. Macbook doesn&#039;t have ethernet port, that&#039;s why I have to do something like this. But then I find I cannot access luci via my macbook(trying to open webpage at <a href="http://192.168.178.36">http://192.168.178.36</a>), looks like ports all closed in operwrt. I tried to setup port forward in operwrt, but I messed it up, now I cannot even access luci via <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>... Anyone help me please?</p>									</div>
