					<p>Managed to get it back up - &gt; WGET openwrt bin file to temp and MTD flash firmware.</p><p>Unfortunately I managed to brick it after uploading original TP-Link FW via luci.</p><p>Anyone have experience with Serial on this? Using Nokia cable hooked up to board (near Jp2 marking on board, Rx,Tx,GND,VCC from Pin 1)&nbsp; i just get garbled output which seems to cycle inline with LED&#039;s which are in 2-3 sec loop of flashing power and then wan followed by QSS twice.</p><p>Based on spped of cycle I am guessing that Uboot may be damaged.</p>									</div>
