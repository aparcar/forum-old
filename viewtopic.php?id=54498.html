					<p>Hello!</p><p>I bought an TL-WA860RE (Want to get rid of Powerline/PLC. Very good connection/over 100MBit/s. But for the second time devices become faulty after a year meaning connection freezes for 20-30s every few minutes...). It is running stock firmware and is connected to a Fritzbox (WIFI AP) in universal repeater mode.</p><p>As far as I understood the WIKI my old TL-WR740n v4 needs to run as WDS Client (to connect other LAN devices to the same subnet). DD-WRT allows normal Client mode within same subnet, but the atheros dropping... (at least it did a year ago, maybe fixed for DD-WRT as well).</p><p>Even if I would flash the 860 to OpenWRT there would not be a possibility to connect the 860 to the fritzbox&nbsp; in universal mode and repeat the WIFI in WDS mode to let the 740 connect to the 860?! All connected devices needs to run within the same subnet.</p><p>I think there might be no way with OpenWRT or stock firmware and I need to try DD-WRT again or buying another WIFI Client. Or is there another possibility?!</p>									</div>
