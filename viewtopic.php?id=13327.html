					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;m running a whiterussian v0.9 on a wl500gp, and I would like to set up a gateway/proxy on which data exchanged would be encrypted.<br />The idea is to use public wifi (restaurant, park...) which is most of the time not secure and to make all the traffic go through my router (at home, through my Internet connection). The data between me in a public park and my router being encrypted, the ones between my router and the visited (destination) websites not encrypted.<br />I heard about ipsec, ssh tunneling and so on but I don&#039;t really know which of these would be simpler and more secure to implement.<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>if you only need secure web access then google up on ssh and use it as a socks proxy and configure your browser to use the ssh tunnel as a socks proxy. works fine and its dead easy to set up as OpenWRT already has ssh/dropbear installed. Combine it with ssh keys and you&#039;ve got a winner!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick answer.<br />But will the DNS traffic also be taken into account ?<br />I wonder if not just the HTTP one will be through that method (okay then most part of the effective data will be protected anyway...)</p>									</div>

					<p>no it does not solve dns privacy, but I keep a local dns cache so I didnt bother with it. The next step is a full on VPN solution, but socks and semi protected dns is fine by me. Its probably possible to tunnel dns too, but since dns use udp then I couldnt be bothered to tunnel it with ssh - but ofcourse you can investegate that route too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay you mean you keep in local a matching table of names and ips... that prevents false/fake dns answers (that could lead to phishing).<br />Since I already have dropbear installed, I will look in that direction first, thanks (dropbear or openssh I guess...)</p>									</div>
