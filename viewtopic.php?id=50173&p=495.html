Please explain for what is initramfs useful?</p></blockquote></div><p>It&#039;s part of the preparation for bumping to 4.7, but not specific to it at all. I&#039;ll publish another series once it&#039;s more ready for public consumption. It will be rebased on the openwrt github repository, this is the openwrt forum after all.</p><p>Now for the interesting question. What is an initramfs useful for?</p><p>For simpler setups you usually tell the kernel how to mount root by passing some arguments to the kernel. Openwrt rule is not to touch the bootloader, well, better for newbies and on some locked down platforms openwrt supports the bootloader probably hates you enough that you couldn&#039;t even if you wanted to.</p><p>For non trivial setups people use an initramfs to mount root. Your root might be encrypted or is on a raid that needs to be assembled first, even a separate /usr might require an initramfs this days. So the purpose is to mount root and resume the normal boot process thereafter.</p><p>To support booting our devices with the openwrt / lede rootfs there are 3 choices. Fix the kernel commandline in uboot, use an initramfs or do what I dislike add a dozen hacks to linux so it still boots with a bogus kernel commandline.</p><p>There are other benefits of a initramfs, but they aren&#039;t relevant for me integrating initramfs support.</p>									</div>

My only concern is odhcpd is selected by default in menuconfig (therefore is included in all precompiled Trunk images since 4.4.x is now default), however I need to build a bare bones image with no custom config files to verify if this occurs by default with kernel 4.4.x, and if not, begin testing if something else the image is built with is causing the issue.<br /></p><ul><li><p>While it is possible one of my custom configs I include in the build could be the issue, I can use the same custom files on a 4.1.x or 3.18.x kernel build with no issues, which would seem to indicate either the custom files aren&#039;t the issue, or there&#039;s something in one or more that causes wonkiness with odhcpd with kernel 4.4.x</p></li></ul>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 8 Jul 2016, 21:07)</p>
