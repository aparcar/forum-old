					<p>Hi everybody!<br />1. I&#039;m so sorry, but I&#039;m noob in OpenWRT install and the WIKI didn&#039;t help me. I&#039;ve got little experience with Putty, Telnet and linux command line, but I haven&#039;t found specific description to install, and a firmware to this device.<br />2. I know that F5D8235-4 v1 was supported, but few days ago the v2 is supported, too. What should I download from download section? I haven&#039;t found prebuild to this device, and I absolutely don&#039;t know how can I make a build and what should I download for this.<br />3. If someone answer me, please write it on &quot;noob language&quot;!</p><p>For me the most important services are: WebGUI (other people also uses the router), free DDNS client, broadcast address in firewall settings or include WOL service, PPPoE, Gigabit ethernet, Wireless N, (maybe USB storage server, but it isn&#039;t important). I tried DD-WRT, but my PPPoE doesn&#039;t work, so I want to go back original firmware.</p><p>matthewKER</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, but where??? I was searching 6 hours!<br />For example in Downloads there are lot of directory. Where are my files? This router has Ralink chip, which has NOT directory.<br />In WIKI found this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#belkin">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#belkin</a> , but from here I can&#039;t download a firmware, only a &quot;changeset&quot;.</p>									</div>
