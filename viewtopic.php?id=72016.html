					<p>I have a TP-Link TD9980B running OpenWrt Designated Driver 50108 and setting up the DSL connections caused me some trouble. Cos I didn&#039;t found a solution on the internet and had to figure it out by myselve, I post this little How to.</p><p>Some background information: 2 Months ago the German Telekom changed my internet connecten, without any notice, so my router went offline, off course the hotline couldn&#039;t help me. In some forum I read about that the packages on the DSL connection need to be tagged with the VLAN ID 7. I tried it with the original firmaware of the TP-Link and the router went online again, but with poor LAN performance. I could ping websides but not open them in any browser (browsing via WLAN was working fine), since I wanted to fix the LAN performance I flashed the TP-Link with openWrt 2 weeks ago.</p><p>Part of my network config (for ADSL2+)(/etc/config/network):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config atm-bridge &#039;atm&#039;
    option vpi &#039;1&#039;
    option vci &#039;32&#039;
    option encaps &#039;llc&#039;
    option payload &#039;bridged&#039;

config dsl &#039;dsl&#039;
    option annex &#039;j&#039;
    option xfer_mode &#039;atm&#039;

config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;nas0.7&#039;
    option proto &#039;pppoe&#039;
    option ipv6 &#039;1&#039;
    option username &#039;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx#0001@t-online.de&#039;
    option password &#039;your_password&#039;

config device &#039;wan_dev&#039;
    option name &#039;nas0&#039;
    option macaddr &#039;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&#039; #your mac address or choose one

config interface &#039;wan6&#039;
    option ifname &#039;@wan&#039;
    option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;
    option reqaddress &#039;none&#039;
    option reqprefix &#039;auto&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The most important lin in the config is:<br />option ifname &#039;nas0<strong>.7</strong>&#039;<br />this will tell openWrt to tag the DSL packets with VLAN ID 7, you could use any VLAN ID here as longe your ISP accepts them. If you have a VDSL connection instead of ADSL you wouldn&#039;t use the nas0 pseudo adapter, in that case you need to put atm0 or ptm0 with the coresponding VLAN ID port (for Telekom it&#039;s again 7 = ptm0.7), obviously you have to change the other DSL settings to fit you setup too.</p><p>PS:I&#039;ve seen network configs with a vlan switch setup (config switch_vlan) to tag the DSL-Port but this doesn&#039;t worked for my TP-Link.<br />PPS: The LAN problems occured with the original firmare are fixed with openWrt and the router ist working fine.</p>									</div>
