					<p>Set this up like a guest network with the balcony router running as a &quot;dumb AP&quot; and VLANs on the cable with routing done at the main router (connected to the modem) so that public users don&#039;t mix with your LAN.</p><p>I think you can use sqm (Install luci-app-sqm will bring in necessary scripts and kmods as dependencies) then apply it to the public interface.&nbsp; Set an overall limit for the public users that is considerably lower than your ISP speed.</p><p>Also it would not hurt to run another instance of SQM on the ISP interface.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 16 Mar 2018, 16:18)</p>

					<p>ok this is also a good idea but a static speed limit is not so good because they&#039;re so many people in my area that they are will reach the limit all the time.</p>									</div>
