					<p>There are a couple of issues I have with running a vanilla Linux distribution.&nbsp; One is that it&#039;s a bit large memory wise.&nbsp; The other is that I&#039;d like a bit more traffic monitoring and filtering ability.&nbsp; It&#039;s mostly just a dumb router otherwise.</p>									</div>

					<p>sorry to necro something on my first post, but i&#039;ve been looking all over everywhere for any information. i just got a soekris 4801 and sangoma s518 that i would like to use as a adsl modem and simple router. is there any way of doing this with openwrt? or any other forks? or anyone kind enough to give me some clue on how to get it working with ANY os? i tried fiddling about with openwrt for awhile, but had given up for the time being, and went looking at other options. i have tried all sorts and can&#039;t seem to get anything that supports the sangoma card.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lysol</strong> on 9 Jan 2011, 09:32)</p>
