					<p>I have been over the forums and can only find a couple posts about this. lots about setting up openvpn server, but i need my client up. been using dd-wrt till recently, but have switched due to stablity issues. anyway. here is my situation.</p><p>using luci to configure im not sure i end up with the right entries in my config files. when i compare them to what the couple other folks have with strong vpn it doesnt look the same. when i use the entries that others have had success with and have made changes to my files. i dont have much success. If someone can just let me know what they need me to post here to try and work through this it would be great. </p><p>also why when i manually edit conf files why does the web interface no longer read them? am i doing something wrong?</p><p>wndr 3700 backfire 10.09</p><p>referenced these posts.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24048">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24048</a></p><p><a href="http://open-wrt.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=23826">http://open-wrt.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=23826</a></p>									</div>
