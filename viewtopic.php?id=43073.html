					<p>Greetings all-</p><p>so I just purchased a WNDR3700 from Amazon, and the Version 4 showed up in the mail. None of the firmware builds appear to work with it. I opened it up, and I don&#039;t see too many different things there: JTAG and Serial are as plain as day.</p><p>How would ya&#039;ll recommend I go about flashing this with OpenWRT? Is V4 currently unsupported, and if so, why? What info can I provide to get it working if this is the case?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Figured I&#039;d provide an update.... I&#039;ve found a lot of posts from people who have gotten something to work, but they&#039;re not sharing. Some in this community, some in others. Below are a list of helpful item&#039;s that I&#039;ve come across:</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=708924">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=708924</a><br /><a href="http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNDR3700v4">http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_WNDR3700v4</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41094">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41094</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a><br /><a href="ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2/2011/04-09-11-r16785/netgear-wndr3700/">ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/others/eko/BrainSl â€¦ -wndr3700/</a></p><p>I&#039;m currently able to compile Netgears firmware, and have noticed it is based on an old version of openwrt. My last &#039;gettn in the weeds&#039; of openwrt was with white russian, so I&#039;m not to familiar with the latest code base. How would someone suggest going about merging the differences between netgear&#039;s build and the lastest code base for openwrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>from looking at this a little while back, and as i&#039;m sure you read, the main problem right now for openwrt is supporting the nand flash.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you could probably compile a kernel and use extroot w/ a usb drive.</p><p>what it would take to put in nand support into the filesystems, i have no idea.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah- I did come across that dd-wrt seems to have support for it to some extent from this forum here:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41094">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41094</a></p><p>What would it take to compare what Netgear did in their version of openwrt and the official one from here? I&#039;ve been poking around the differences between the two build processes; but will focus more on the file system components.</p>									</div>
