					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve started experimenting with OpenWRT a few weeks ago on my Router (TP-Link TP-WR841ND V7) and it has been running up with no problems since I installed it. So I wanted to go deeper installing more packages and making configurations and found the USB Mod, thought I have some nasic knowledge on electronic I decided to give it a shot.</p><p>But I&#039;m stucked applying the kernel patch, I&#039;m not an expert in linux and compiling images but I try to read a lot in these cases. So, i&#039;ve take a look at the Wiki and this is what I understood (Correct me if I&#039;m wrong).</p><p>Have To:</p><p> - Download and Install evertything regarding on OpenWrt Buildroot.</p><p> - Download the source code (latest trunk I think).</p><p> - Choose options and packages to include (not really sure what to do here, but USB kernel patch must be done here?)</p><p> - Build and compile?</p><br /><p>Please let me know if this is ok or if there it&#039;s a simpler way to do it, or what would be better, can I flash a Openwrt version for this model with usb kernel patch already installed? </p><p>Although I want the usb port to add more space to install packages, I wanted to know if do you think it will be ok to serve as a media share (photos, music and videos) over the network via nfs or samba to other computers and tablets.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This is what I got at the moment:</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/1107/img20120905220723.jpg" alt="http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/1107/img20120905220723.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/985/img20120905220727.jpg" alt="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/985/img20120905220727.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/7788/img20120905220735.jpg" alt="http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/7788/img20120905220735.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2562/img20120905223441.jpg" alt="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2562/img20120905223441.jpg" /></span></p><p>I&#039;ve measured Voltage and Impedance and these are the values I&#039;m receiving:</p><p>Voltage: 5.04 V</p><p>D- / GND = D+ / GND = 8 ?</p><p>D- / D+ = 17 ?</p><p>Thanks a lot and sorry for my english.</p>									</div>

You could wait for it to get fixed, or give 12.09-beta a try: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841nd-v7-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ actory.bin</a></p>									</div>
