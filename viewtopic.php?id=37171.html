					<p>Is it possible that there is something wrong with the firmware openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr740n-v4-squashfs-factory.bin from 29-May-2012?</p><p>Yesterday I flashed this firmware to a TP-Link TL-WR740N V4.21 using the stock webgui. After flashing the router does not respond anymore.<br />I&#039;m aware that after flashing there is no webgui anymore, but there is no response at all anymore. I tried to telnet and ping to 192.168.1.1 but nothing.<br />After powering up the device the first led is on, then the second is blinking for a short time then also on. If I push the qss button during that time, it is blinking faster, but still not possible to telnet to the box. (This is the failsafe procedure I found)</p><p>First I thought it is because of wrong version of the box (I just found howtos saying something about v4.2 but not 4.21) but then I found those posts:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=168465#p168465">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 65#p168465</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=168452#p168452">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 52#p168452</a></p><p>Maybe that is connected?</p><p>Could somebody please give me a hint what is going on?<br />Is it possible that there is really a problem with that firmware? Is there a way out without soldering the serial connection?</p><p>Any suggestion/hint is welcome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moondog</strong> on 30 May 2012, 17:31)</p>

					<p>Sry, maybe I forgot to mention that I have of course changed the network settings of the connected pc to static 192.168.1.2 (after getting no dhcp from the box).<br />Or did I get your answer wrong?<br />I&#039;m not able to connect to the box with a browser (or telnet or ssh or ping).</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like a bug in the firmware of the trunk for ar71xx is at least confirmed for the Tl-wr703n.</p><p>I don&#039;t know how this trunk gets updated but as all files in there have more or less the same timestamp I suspekt that<br />some update for the whole trunk caused the problem.</p><p>Thus my questions:</p><p>- Is it possible to access older builds somehow?<br />- Who should be contacted in order to sort this problem out?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, again answering myself ;-) as there is coming more and more light in this and at least<br />some people are looking at this thread and might be happy to get some infos.</p><p>It is now more or less clear that there was a buggy release from 29-May-2012 preventing access to the ethernetports of the box.<br />This faulty firmware is now removed from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a></p><p>Problem is, that at the moment there is no firmware at all for almost all devices in this trunk.</p><p>So if someone can provide a working firmware for tl-wr740n version 4 please let me/us know. I&#039;m willing to test a debrick procedure<br />as soon as I have a working firmware (and ok course having soldered this damn serial connection).</p>									</div>
