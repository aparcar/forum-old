					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using Backfire 10.03.1-rc5 on a Netgear WNDR3700 v1, connected on the WAN side to a SMC cable modem. The cable modem and the Netgear both have static routable IPs on the public interfaces (so to be clear, the Netgear is not configured to run a DHCP client on the WAN interface). </p><p>The thing is, the Netgear appears to boot faster than the modem, so when power is restored to both simultaneously, the Netgear boots first and apparently doesn&#039;t bring up the WAN interface because the link is not active. I haven&#039;t spent a great deal of time looking into what exactly is going on, but the WAN interface never becomes active in the dmesg output, and sure enough, if I log in from the LAN, the WAN interface is UP but not RUNNING.</p><p>So it seems reasonable enough to have a boot script that sleeps for a couple of minutes and then restarts WAN connectivity. But I find myself stumped on the simplest part--how to restart WAN connectivity without just rebooting (and a post-boot script that sleeps for a bit and then reboots if the Internet is not accessible is a bad recipe for a reboot loop, so I&#039;d rather avoid that path). </p><p>ifdown &amp;&amp; ifup eth1 results in:</p><p>interface not found.<br />interface not found.<br />/sbin/uci: Invalid argument<br />/sbin/uci: Invalid argument<br />Interface type&nbsp; not supported.</p><p>To be honest, I hate shell scripting, so I have not dug into the cause of this. </p><p>Bringing down the interface and back up via ifconfig down/up does not fix the issue. </p><p>/etc/init.d/networking restart outputs &quot;command failed: No such device (-19)&quot; and, again, does not fix the issue. </p><p>So I could certainly dig into these errors a bit and figure out what commands are failing, but perhaps someone here can save me the trouble?</p><p>More generally, I have two questions:</p><p>1. Is there a better way to detect the WAN activation than sleeping after boot or polling in a cron job?<br />2. What&#039;s the best way to react to WAN activation short of a reboot?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Edit: FYI, at the moment I&#039;m doing the horrible hackish reboot-if-the-network-is-down script I described. It&#039;s a workable solution, to be sure, but really even sadder than duct tape.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Dan0</strong> on 28 Aug 2011, 09:05)</p>

					<p>fyi, </p><p>I assume all fixes in rc4 are rolled up into rc5, no? </p><p>It&#039;s possible that adding a switch solves this problem by causing the Netgear to perceive the Ethernet connection to be active (since the link would terminate in an already-on powered hub rather than the still-booting cable modem), so this sounds like it may be the same problem. I will ask &quot;bro&quot; if he can confirm that a single reboot of the Netgear does not cause this problem. </p><p>I unfortunately don&#039;t know more about what must happen for an interface to be considered &quot;running&quot; once it&#039;s up. I&#039;ll go poke around the Internets or kernel.org (ugh). </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, and mag81, init.d/network restart does not bring it up for me, but if it does for you, you could just configure the following script to run at startup:</p><p>#!/bin/sh</p><p>COUNT=4<br />TARGET=8.8.8.8</p><p>count1=$(ping -c $COUNT $TARGET | grep &#039;received&#039; | awk -F&#039;,&#039; &#039;{ print $2 }&#039; | awk &#039;{ print $1 }&#039;)</p><p>if [ $count1 -eq 0 ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /etc/init.d/network restart<br />fi</p>									</div>
