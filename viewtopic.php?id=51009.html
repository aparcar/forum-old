					<p>Hello Community</p><p>I have two RB411 boards, one is the RB411GL and the other is the RB411AH.</p><p>The RB4411AH has a serial port and boots just fine with a compiled ar71xx initramfs.elf image file.</p><p>The RB411GL does not have a serial port.&nbsp; I netboot successfully with the same image and can see the device is pulling the file from my TFTP server correctly, but the problem I am having is that the RB411 uses a different Ethernet chip to the RB411AH, namely the Atheros AR8035.</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT and am asking here if anyone can point me in the right direction of how/where to download the AR8035 sources and tell me how to update the build system to include them.</p><p>I have seen a few patches relating to AR8035, but I don&#039;t know how to apply them.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Be gentle with me, I am learning.&nbsp; :-)</p><p>Many thanks</p><p>Mark.</p>									</div>
