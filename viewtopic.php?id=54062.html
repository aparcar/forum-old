					<p>What I&#039;d like to do is configure a kernel that is exactly the same as the default one, plus a couple drivers (which are available in &#039;make menuconfig&#039;) as well as speedstep support (which isn&#039;t in the main config). The problem is, the kernel_menuconfig seems to not default to the openWRT kernel settings, but rather vanilla kernel settings (e.g. NF_NAT stuff disabled). It also doesn&#039;t seem to reflect any changes I make in the top-level menuconfig. I can confirm that these things are actually reflected in the kernel produced by the builder (no NAT support). </p><p>So basically, how does the kernel build actually work, and how do I get it to just use the same configuration as the stock kernel? I understand that it uses the files in target/linux and that kernel_menuconfig edits those, but why are those different from the configuration of the pre-compiled kernel available in the downloads?</p>									</div>
