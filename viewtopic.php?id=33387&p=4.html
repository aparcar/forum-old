Instead of squeezing them inside the firmware now I am expending them as an extra-root packages on usb disk or nfs share. It makes more sense since by using transmission you will definitely have a usb disk attached. Apart from transmission/mldonkey I am planning to put 3G dongle support, mpd, python, gstreamer etc in the form of extra-root.</p><p>Just need to work out local (UTF8) support so you will have file names saved correctly for example Asian characters. I hope to finish them by end of Jan. This gives you some time to solder 64MB memory on WR703N which is highly recommended if you plan to run transmission on it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>s7mx1</strong> on 3 Jan 2012, 15:02)</p>

I&#039;d suggest being patient when you&#039;re soldering as the pads really are minuscule, I used enameled copper wire (and scraped the enamel off, then tinned a short amount), use the finest iron tip you have (I just about managed with a 1mm tip, which is crazy, because it was about twice the size of the pad -- not recommended!). Good luck, it&#039;s a lot of fun. I haven&#039;t been able to get anything meaningful coming up when I try and use &#039;screen&#039; to watch uboot, it&#039;s all gibberish, I&#039;m waiting for my USB to TTL adapter to come before I try anything (I&#039;m using a USB to RS232 at the moment, I think it&#039;s gibberish cause RS232 uses inverted logic)</p></blockquote></div><p>@willprice94</p><p>The gibberish you saw is because the serial console on WR703N is running at 3V while the usb to RS232 you are using is running at 5v.

If you have 2V signal this will present &quot;1&quot; bit with 3V serial console however the same signal would mean &quot;0&quot; bit with 5V serial console. Therefore you cannot use 5V serial console with 3V TTL like those used on most routers.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m fairly busy at the moment with exams so haven&#039;t really had any time to progress with my project (using the router as a wireless client which will stream internet radio interfaced with a microcontroller dealing with physical IO)</p><p>I&#039;ll have a bash with your firmware sometime and see if I come across any issues this time (now being a little more knowledgeable in how mtd works and flash layouts etc) and report back.</p></blockquote></div><p>The latest firmware version 28854-1229 will have wifi AP on by default. With nas firmware the ethernet port acts like wan and you need to connect it to an uplink router. With pulseaudio firmware it acts like lan and you can connect your pc straight to it. However the behaviour of the ethernet port can be switched easily on my crated-from-scratch web gui page. On that web gui page you can also setup wifi client as well so no need to mess around with system configuration files. The wifi client will interfere with wifi ap if you entered the wrong ssid or key and hence disabled by default. I assume you need to set this to have audio streaming over wifi.</p><p>Each firmware now has two ways to manage it: ethernet and wifi therefore make it harder to brick.</p>									</div>
