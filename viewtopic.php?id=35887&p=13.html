					<p>Hi there, guys.</p><p>I recently switched ISPs, and have been considering OpenWRT for x86 for a number of reasons, including possible power issues with my TP-1043ND router (it&#039;s still working side-by-side with my new ISP-issued 4G router, until the old ISP disconnects me for good and I think about which 4G modem to get, since the current Alcatel Y800Z 4G router is the worst router I have EVER seen).</p><p>I do, however, have a few questions I&#039;d like to have answered, before I take the plunge, and I figured this thread could be the best one for it.</p><p>1) I&#039;m thinking of re-purposing an Acer Aspire Revo 3610 (NVIDIA Ion, Atom 330, 4GB of RAM), with an Atheros-based 150Mbps TP-Link USB dongle (or even its internal wireless card, but I&#039;m guessing it won&#039;t be N-class, or even if it is, it&#039;s probably Broadcom-based, hence no AP support from OpenWRT x86, right?). Should I expect any problems with OpenWRT, especially when it comes to the Ethernet connection?</p><p>2) What&#039;s the best way to handle installation? Dedicated USB drive for it, with the HDD used for storage only (I&#039;m planning on running transmission), or direct HDD install?</p><p>3) Any known issues with regards to 4G/LTE USB modems? This is one of the reasons I&#039;m considering x86, my 1043ND is known for not putting out enough power through the USB port, which might require a very weird setup, because of the added powered USB hub.</p><p>4) Are any VPN packages available? What kind of performance should I expect from a VPN (probably OpenVPN) connection, considering my connection is a 20Mb/2Mb one?</p><p>5) While in the context of VPNs, how hard would it be to restrict VPN usage for certain kinds of sites/IP ranges (my ISP is applying TS mostly to international IP addresses)?</p><p>6) Anything else I might be missing?</p><p>Lastly, how would OpenWRT work differently from something like pfSense (which I believe also has Wireless AP support)?</p><p>Thank you very much in advance for any help you might give me, and thank you for the work you put on this firmware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Miguel</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, for some reason I was also not notified of replies to this thread... Odd...</p><p>@ryts: I&#039;ve tried the ROOter firmware on my 1043ND. It didn&#039;t go very well, it kept loosing connection. Probably because I was trying to use the modem directly on the router&#039;s USB port, and it kept dropping the connection. I&#039;ll probably try again with a powered hub, but something smells fishy.</p><p>@mcrosson: IPFire was a bust, it didn&#039;t even recognize the modem, much less dial out, and I don&#039;t know how to handle that. I&#039;m probably too much of a noob to be messing with that, or maybe, just maybe, it should be able to be in place since the DOS-like setup...</p><p>As ryts said, 4G on pfsense is iffy at best, and I&#039;ve managed to come across some unfortunate information about pfsense and my modem (Huawei E392), as in, you apparently need to hack FreeBSD some before being able to run the modem, which, again, I&#039;m too much of a noob to handle.</p><p>So, this leaves me with going with OpenWRT for x86 (your package) or switching over to a Windows-based router, which I can actually fix myself, though at the rather severe loss of centralized management via an HTTP GUI.</p><p>Right now, I&#039;d like to try OpenWRT for x86. How should I go about it? Which image, combined or rootfs?
