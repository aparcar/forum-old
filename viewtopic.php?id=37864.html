					<p>Hello,</p><p>So I have this version running from <a href="http://www.erriko.it/internet-co/fonera/openwrt-ufficiale-per-fonera-2-0n-repository-erriko-it-update-r31696/">http://www.erriko.it/internet-co/fonera â€¦ te-r31696/</a> , and so far all is good, but when I try to install openvpn it gives me this:</p><p>Collected errors:<br /> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for openvpn:<br /> * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.3.8-1-6bd8461d1e0c4f7c08833bc29d4b31b9) * <br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package openvpn.</p><p>So I guess my kernel is a bit outdated, I suppose the next step would be to compile openvpn for kernel 3.3.5 ?<br />(or upgrade the kernel, but I hear this router of mine is a bit difficult because of the wireless drivers which aren&#039;t open-source, so I suppose this might be more difficult, on the other hand I won&#039;t be needing any wireless functionality, only the usb port intrests me, so if it is possible to just flash it to the latest backfire that would be awesome, not sure which version I should choose though)</p><p>My linux experience is &quot;limited&quot; at best, so if any of you have any pointers/links that might be helpful to me in getting this router to work as I want, that would be most kind.</p><p>As far as I can make up I should install this &quot;openwrt buildroot&quot; package on a linux OS (using backtrack atm) and than use it to compile the openvpn package, not sure on how I should go about this, so ... yeah, help pls</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
