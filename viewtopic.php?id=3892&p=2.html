					<p>yeah baby yeah!!</p><p>running at 16MB now!!!</p><p>since the CFE of the se505v2 seems to be set to 4x16 and doesn&#039;t detect my 8x16 fully i thought: why not use the second RAM-place on the board.</p><p>so i soldered the original 4x16 on the second RAM spot, inserted a few 0Ohm bridges to connect the Adress-lines (there should be 33Ohm resistors according to the first RAM-spot. but they are REALY small. not the SMD-resistors with the resistance printed on it. even smaller. tried to solder somme 33Ohm from an old graphics card... but they were way too big. so i simply shortened them to connect the adress-pins).</p><p>and here i am, my Router has 16MB ram now and is finaly usable (8MB isn&#039;t much...)!!</p><p>ok, it was not as straightforward as it sounds... i soldered and unsoldered each of the RAM-chips at least twice, so i am realy used to soldering these small bastards now... but finaly it works!<br />if anyone wants to do this to his se505v2 too: don&#039;t solder a capacitor on C319, leave it open. i soldered one and it didn&#039;t boot anymore... unsoldered it, and it worked.</p><p>TODO to get from 8MB to 16MB on the se505v2:<br />shorten:<br />&nbsp; R314<br />&nbsp; R315<br />&nbsp; R316<br />&nbsp; R317<br />&nbsp; R318<br />and solder a 4Mx16 sdram on the second RAM-spot.<br />afte booting the router you should have 16MB ! :-)<br />now do:<br />---<br />nvram set sdram_ncdl=0<br />nvram commit<br />reboot<br />---<br />to let the cfe reconfigure this value. <br />this is all you have to do! no change in sdram_init, it is ignored by the CFE on this router.</p><p>HAVE FUN!</p><br /><p>TODO:<br />build a cfe that supports 8Mx16rams, so i can go to 32MB RAM with two 16MB 8Mx16 would be nice...<br />anyone used to this and willing to help me?</p><p>axc27</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>axc27</strong> on 2 Sep 2006, 13:19)</p>
