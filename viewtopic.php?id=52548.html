					<p>Hello and sorry for english is not my native language.<br />I&#039;m newbie in OpenWRT and even Linux world and there are some things i can&#039;t do myself, so i begging for some help. I have really bad HDD with physical bad sectors (over 6000) i want to use as network storage or use for something in generally. There is &gt;350Gb usable area from 640Gb, the rest have areas with bad or problematic sector from begining to around 240Gb and last 13Gb. So i want to scan those sectors with <strong>badblocks</strong> and mark it, so i can isolated those areas and create partitions in good areas.<br />The problem is, those scan taking too much time and my PC runs all night and days (i have dual boot Win 8 and Ubuntu and some times i need to switch to Win OS) and when i stop the process, sometimes i forgot to write the result from log file and override it next time i run <strong>badblocks</strong> (stupid mistake but happens too often). </p><p>Up to the point. I found there is <strong>badblocks</strong> in OpenWRT packages, so i decide to run it from my router and leave it as long as it takes. My &quot;machine&quot; is - TP-Link 1043ND v1, Attitude Adjustment 12.09, with external root on other HDD, recognised as <strong>/dev/sda</strong>, with 3 ext4 partitions - 1 for data, 1 for overlay boot and 1 for swap. The first problem became when i connect second, problematic disk and reboot router. The second disk become <strong>/dev/sda</strong> and the working one become <strong>/dev/sdb</strong>. I have a lot of config (Samba Share, Ftp server etc) where i use <strong>/dev/sda</strong> and i had to change everything manually to replace with sdb. And a lot of mess happens with many things... Fortunately i use UUID for major Mount Points so this worked but i have some other tweecks using Mount Point to mount directory in directory for some FTP needs. So i there a way to force system to recognize my disk always as SDA, and not changed it to SD-&quot;something else&quot; when i plug other media?</p><p>And the main thing. I need to run <strong>badblocks</strong> on second disk and create log file with bad sectors on first disk. I can do it from random Terminal, Putty etc, but this make whole things pointless because i need working machine as terminal anyway. So i discover <strong>rc.local</strong> thing in Luci and decide to use it to run <strong>badblocks</strong> from there. I paste following code before &quot;exit 0&quot; and reboot:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>badblocks -o /mnt/sda1/Tsanko/bad.txt -svwt /dev/sdb</code></pre></div><p>And the first mess become. As i describe above my disk mount was in opposite way i was thinking, and i use <strong>-t</strong> from badblocks example with destructive scan without knowing this is &quot;force&quot;.... so i destroy my main disk partitions. I manage to rescue overlay partition with all data using <strong>TestDisk</strong>, but no success with data partition (no important info there yet, so nevermind). So i have to recreate my data and swap partitions, but fortunately my config survive. Amyway, i tried again with the correct commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>badblocks -o /mnt/sdb1/Tsanko/bad.txt -svw /dev/sda</code></pre></div><p>and this time everything in &quot;badblocks&quot; side work well, disk is scanned, log file is filled, it is in System Log of Luci. But my Internet connection is broken for some reason. I use pppoe connection through WAN. After reboot it connect, but no internet traffic or ping. I can reconnect once with the same condition, the third try can&#039;t connect at all, there is nothing in logs. It is definitely related to those <strong>badblocks</strong> command i run in rc.local, because if i reboot without it, pppoe working fine. I have no idea what is the link between those two. But if i run the same commands through external Terminal, there is no problem.<br />So for now i use SSH terminal on one Android phone to keep <strong>badblocks</strong> working, but it&#039;s a bad idea obviously to keep phone screen 24/7(i hope not, last one).</p><p>So to the major question. What is the most suitable way to run the following command &quot;badblocks -o /mnt/sdb1/Tsanko/bad.txt -svw /dev/sda&quot; directly in Router, without affecting my internet connection or something else? I read about some .rc scripts, and i think i can run following command there instead of writing it directly, putting script in rc.local with some high Start priority. But my knowledge are insufficient for this and i have no idea how to create some script, where to place the file, syntax, nothing, and whether it will work at all. So i need some help please.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ragner</strong> on 2 Sep 2014, 22:36)</p>

The rest of the drive, besides those 2 or 3 blocks is ok, but i want to isolate manually all areas with consecutive bad sectors, so i need to scan and mark it. As i wrote i create about 350Gb partition with no problems, even delay blocks (scanned with MHDD), but i want to deal with the rest usable area with bad blocks within, even manually if i have to.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>tmo26 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>ragner wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>So i there a way to force system to recognize my disk always as SDA, and not changed it to SD-&quot;something else&quot; when i plug other media?</p></blockquote></div><p>mount by label</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve already done this, but there is some cases when i need sd letter. For example <strong>badblocks</strong> commands where i have to specify /dev/sd-letter after reboot and there is no guarantee it will be the same next reboot or if i attach other media. And other example - i have 2 ftp users with 2 root directories in /mnt/sda1, and 1 directory with 2 sub directories for anonymous access. I found a way to easy share files from those 2 users by mount 2 directories from their root to sub directories for anonymous access. Here is the part of my fstab to be precise:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config mount
    option enabled &#039;1&#039;
    option device &#039;/mnt/sdb1/Tsanko/Share&#039;
    option target &#039;/mnt/sdb1/Share/Tsanko&#039;</code></pre></div><p>When it was &quot;sda1&quot; everything worked fine, but now it worked sometimes, even after i changed sd letter, because the whole /mnt part become complete mess with those letter change. If you can help me do something similar with labels i will appreciate it. As i said, i am newbie or even noobie in this things no matter how much reading i went through.</p><p>Thanks for replies, but i still need help with those rc scripts to make things work with no need of external terminal for <strong>badblocks</strong>. Or if someone have better idea how to make it work within router at start up without crashing my internet connection?</p>									</div>
