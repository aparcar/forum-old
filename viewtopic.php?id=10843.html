					<p>I&#039;m running White Russian 0.9 on an Asus WL-500gP hooked up to a cable modem. When I run the <a href="http://www.speakeasy.com">www.speakeasy.com</a> speed test my speeds are 18,800kbps down and 427kbps up on a computer connected by ethernet cable to the router.</p><p>When I swap in a WRT-54G running DD-WRT I get about the same download but the upload speed jumps to 2681kbps.</p><p>Any clue what might be causing White Russian to upload 6 times slower than DD-WRT? Both routers are configured the same way with basic firewall settings. I would much prefer to stick with White Russian but if I can&#039;t fix this I&#039;m going to have to revert to DD-WRT.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you test WR0.9 on your WRT54G, because maybe the chipset deal a place in the problem ?</p><p>To test the firmare you have to test with the same hardware.</p><p>Test Asus with DdWRT or/and OpenWRT with WRT54G to compare.</p>									</div>

					<p>Had the same problem, with my WL-500gp. Download-Speed was OK, but Upload was limited to about 50kb/s. &#039;cause I use the Router to uplink to a 100Mbit-LAN, with MAC-Security, that really bothered me.</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and not that good with Linux, but I figured out, that QoS is somehow messing the WAN-connection, even if deactivated, on this router. When I activated it an inserted connection speeds, Upload increased to about half an MB/s.<br />Now I deinstalled all packages, that had anything to do with QoS and restarted the router.</p><p>Works fine now. Upload to WAN is arround 5 to 6MB/s, which seems to be capped by the CPU.</p><p>Regards,<br />Daniel</p>									</div>

					<p>I had DD-WRT installed once. Liked it, but it&#039;s no practicable for me, &#039;cause the WLAN died, after some time, if no client was connected. Seems to be a bug with the WLAN-Driver used in DD-WRT and the WL-500gp.</p><p>As I recall overlocking is quite easy. There&#039;s only one nvram-variable to change, although you&#039;ve got to keep an eye on proper cooling.</p><p>You may get a MB/s more up- and downlink, by overlocking. Personally I think it&#039;s to risky. The roughly 6 Mega<strong>byte</strong>/s bandwith, I&#039;ll get out of the router, are enough for me. If you&#039;ve read the thread, you should have seen, that my problem was a really slow Upload-Speed to WAN.</p><p>Or do I misunderstand, what you&#039;re asking?</p><p>Regards,<br />Daniel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TheDaniel</strong> on 28 May 2007, 15:39)</p>

					<p>Daniel,</p><p>Thanks for the info on the QoS issue. I did go back to DD-WRT v23 SP3 Asus and I&#039;m back to full upload speed. I&#039;ll probably just wait for Kamakazi before I flash again. Thanks again.</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>
