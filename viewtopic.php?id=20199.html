					<p>Dear forum readers and devels,</p><br /><p>i have 3 Linksys WRT54GL with OpenWRT 2.4 kernel as a WLAN AP, switch and PPPoE router. The routers are in different networks. I use no firewalling on the wireless interface.</p><p>On two routers i experience WLAN hangs from time to time. If i use my VoIP phone (Nokia E90) for wireless SIP calls after around 5-10 minutes i just can hear, but the other call partner can&#039;t hear me further. At the same time i lose my wireless connections from other WLAN devices (like my notebook). I have to reboot the device to get wireless back to work. Just waiting some minutes and hardly reconnecting my notebook / devices to the AP works to.</p><p>If i debug wireless on my (linux) notebook i can see that no answers or any data comes back from AP on AP connect requests and no key exchangecould&nbsp; be donne. This seems crazy because i still can hear the other VoIP party for a while- i.e. 30-60 secs (means the voice is not coming from buffers). I cant find something in the logs. Wired networking works without probs.</p><p>Sometimes the AP hangs just from &quot;surfing&quot; plus a few other connections like SSH, IMAP and Jabber.</p><p>One router works without encryption, the other one with WPA-PSK. So encryption seems not the source of the problem. I changed the channels more then once to avoid any HF interference in the near.</p><p>Btw:<br />How many meters are the maximum settings for wireless radius?</p><p>Any ideas?<br />Do you now any starting points for further debug and troubleshooting?</p><p>Many thanks for any help,</p><p>Niels.<br />---<br /><a href="http://www.syndicat.com">http://www.syndicat.com</a></p>									</div>
