					<p>Attitude Adjustment is ancient, much older than your device. Given that it has been superseded by two newer major releases and full of known security issues, no one is going to work on it and start adding support for newer devices, those have been added to subsequent newer releases instead.</p><p>That said, the source and the changes needed to get your device working is available, no one will stop you from backporting the required changes yourself, but I wouldn&#039;t exactly call it a sane decision.</p>									</div>
