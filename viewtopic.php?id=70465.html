					<p>Hi Forum,</p><p>I want to use my &quot;old&quot; WDR4300 as a WLAN Repeater.<br />Because of the restricted posibilities of the original Firmware, I am testing the useability of OpenWRT.</p><p>My Problem is:<br />Everytime I change the LAN-IP to 192.200.200.200 (Home Network is 192.200.200.xxx / 255.255.255.0) , I am not able to access the Login anymore.</p><p>Details:<br />My Notebook is connected via LAN to the WDR.<br />After the IP-Change, the WDR is not pingable anymore.<br />If I connect my main router (192.200.200.1 / DNS, DHCP, WAN, WLAN2,4&amp;5,0) via WLAN, I can ping 192.200.200.200 but can&#039;t login to the WDR (tested with Firefox, I-Explorer, Putty, Telnet)</p><p>Have tried to configure the router with and without:<br />- DHCP &amp; DNS configuration.<br />- WLAN configuration<br />- Client WDS<br />Also I started from the Factory-Reset and changed the LAN-IP only. But it ends in the same result. </p><p>After every test, I have to switch to the failsafe-mode and need to do a Factory-Reset the WDR.<br />Can anybody help?</p>									</div>
