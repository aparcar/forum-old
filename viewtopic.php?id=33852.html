					<p>FYI...I have this model of Linksys router for Verizon 3G cards.&nbsp; I no longer needed the 3G, so wanted to create a bridge with it.<br />It took me a while, but I was successful by taking the kamikaze 8.09 release and using a hex editor to replace the first four bytes with W3GV.&nbsp; The regular version used W54F and the &quot;em&quot; version used W3GN which I believe was used by others with a slightly different model.&nbsp; Then, I used the Linksys UI to upgrade the firmware.&nbsp; Before I made the change with the hex editor, I got a &quot;Firmware upgrade are failed!&quot; message.</p><p>I used the broadcom 2.4 bin version and setup as bridged client scenario.</p><p>I had some ip address and encryption problems that made the effort much longer than necessary.</p><p>In the end, what worked for me was:</p><p>1.&nbsp; My AP was set up as mixed mode WPA/WPA2.&nbsp; I was trading off using the GUI and CLI to change settings and FINALLY figured out that I had to set to WPA2 for it to work, even though the AP was mixed mode.&nbsp; The only thing I can guess is that the Linksys hardware has the ability to use WPA2 and tries to use it if possible and will not use the WPA.&nbsp; I used the GUI to make the final setting.&nbsp; Actually, I turned off all encryption to get everything working and then turned the encryption back on and then added the appropriate settings.&nbsp; The reason I assumed WPA was that I had recently upgraded my encryption from WEP and had a relatively new device that would only connect WPA, so I assumed the Lynksys would be the same.</p><p>2.&nbsp; I set the Linksys to use DHCP to get IP address from the AP and I created a &quot;reservation&quot; in the AP to give the Linksys the same IP every time based on the MAC address so I would know what IP to use for admin.&nbsp; </p><p>Also, I had to use failsafe mode at one point to reach the router and managed this by pushing the data card button in the front AFTER the dmz light turned on.&nbsp; The dmz light then started flashing and I was able to reach the router at 192.168.1.1, mount_root, and change the ip address in the /etc/config/network file to be what I wanted.</p><p>At first, I used the standard windows xp / control panel / network connections to set my laptop to the static ip I needed to reach the router with a direct ethernet connection.&nbsp; However, at some point, that seemed to stop working and, luckily, I had an IBM Thinkpad app that manages connection settings where I was able to assign a local statuc IP at will.</p><p>So, be careful with the IP address on the router / client bridged mode / encryption and good luck!</p>									</div>
