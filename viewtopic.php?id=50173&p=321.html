					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve a small problem with TFTP Firmware flashing. <br />I&#039;ve got two WRT1900AC v1 where at both the power lamp was blinking, so I tried to TFTP flash them as described at the wiki.<br />With the first everything was ok, but the second one will not flash. <br />The router connects to the tftpd32 server but the transferrate stands at 0 B/s and nothing happens. After a while I get an &#039;Undefined error code&#039; (0). Afterwards the NAND is erased, which is &quot;ok&quot; and then the NAND is written again which also leads to an &quot;ok&quot;. </p><p>Can someone give an adwise how to flash the router now?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
