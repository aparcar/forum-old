					<p>Hi, I have a router TP-LINK WR1043ND, but I think it does not matter.</p><p>I put the software I found on the web and everything and I believe it works as it should. but now I have a problem / question.</p><p>The router has a USB port, which put a 4GB flash memory, and install a program on the FTP router, so now putting the ip of the modem (which I get to do ifconfig from putty) as follows: ftp://IP I access the memory contents.</p><p>The thing is that in my house is usually reset the modem and router (I have fiber optics) so the IP is going to change, and I can not access the memory out of my house, not that I have and I&#039;m not IP to be looking for it at all times.</p><p>Well, is there any way other than static IP, so I always know my IP but this outside my house?</p><p>Thank you all!

					<p>I would recommend <em>not </em>using FTP, especially on a public-facing server. ssh/scp are much more secure for that purpose. </p><p>If directory listing takes too long for you to wait for, you could have a script run by cron that periodically finds all the files and outputs it to a list. You could then grab that file and look to see what you want.</p>									</div>
