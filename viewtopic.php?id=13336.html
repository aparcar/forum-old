It could be after a few hours of working. It reboots and therefore I cannot check log or dmesg. However once I set up remote logining and no message regarding reboot came up. Any idea what I can do? I did some research on the net to no avail.</p><p>khodam</p>									</div>

					<p>same issue here. I got a WRT54G v3.1<br />don&#039;t know, why it reboots yet, waiting for the next reboot to hopefully find something in my just set up remote log...</p><p>Never had any trouble on white russian though... considering switsching back.... these reboots are unacceptable...</p><p>did you find a solution?</p>									</div>

					<p>can definitely confirm this...</p><p>have disabled wifi for some hours now and not have had a reboot since...<br />remote logging gave no result (i.e. no output to syslog before reboot) and i don&#039;t have yet a serial port attached to this device...</p><p>would be nice, if some dev could give a hint, what could be wrong with wifi, or even better someone knows changes concerning it<br />between white russian and kamikaze... as said before it is the regular broadcom from linksys wrt54g v3.1</p><p>could some old orphaned entries from white russian in nvram cause this?</p><p>ps: just came to my mind... do you like me have the wlan in a separate vlan? i &quot;broke&quot; up the bridge so to say and have a sperate net now... <br />i also had this setup without any flaws in my old WR release candidate without any trouble though....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kanne</strong> on 16 Mar 2008, 22:29)</p>

					<p>solved it...</p><p>did: <br />1) mtd -r erase nvram<br />2) get fresh openwrt (with x-wrt extensions) image dated by march 16th from x-wrt page<br />3) flashed the trx to device with mtd -r write image.trx linux<br />4) configured image as it was before, except for not breaking the bridge between wifi and 802.3</p><p>i bet the trouble came from the faulty relicts in nvram from white russian days, but cannot say for sure...<br />the bridge thing would also be possible, but i had the bridge broke up on white russian without trouble, so i kinda doubt it...<br />will try the next days, whether bridge broke up does bring the reboots back...<br />you are welcome to try the steps as above and maybe even solve the question, which of the point is causing the solution...</p><p>cheers<br />kanne</p>									</div>
