					<p>Hi all!</p><p>After having been using OpenWRT on my wr1043nd for a while, I ran into some problems, and wanted to doublecheck with the original firmware. So I downloaded the latest image: <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/Resources/software/TL-WR1043ND_V1_120405.zip">http://www.tp-link.com/Resources/softwa … 120405.zip</a> , unzipped and scp&#039;d it to the device and wrote it with mtd -r write /tmp/original_firmware.bin firmware</p><p>Now the device isn&#039;t exactly dead, but behaves rather strange:</p><p>- SYS LED is always off<br />- does not act as DHCP server for connected PCs anymore - no connection is established at all when just PCs are connected to the LAN ports.<br />- when connected to the cable modem however, all connected PCs get adresses from the providers range (not 192.168.1.x as expected).<br />- the reset button does not work</p><p>I have no idea what the device is doing, but as it is clearly not running the original firmware now and I&#039;m coming from openwrt, I thought I&#039;d ask here.</p><p>Is there anything I can do at all?</p>									</div>

					<p>it could be... new stock firmwares have different bootloaders.. it&#039;s always safer to flash an older version (maybe the one mentioned in wiki.. wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#back.to.original.firmware ) and THEN upgrade to the lastest...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m always puzzled as to why people take the risk and use the console to flash a different firmware...</p><p>Anyway. First of all, TP-Link took down the firmware files that included a new bootloader. How do I know? I flashed to the latest one (Probably the one linked by the OP, &#039;twas from mid 2012 or something) available and now I am using OpenWRT again - no issues.<br />Second, even if the file had a new bootloader, the problems would&#039;ve occured after he flashed OpenWRT again.</p><p>You said the SYS LED is always off but it isn&#039;t exactly &quot;dead&quot;? Are the other LEDs on/blinking/whatever?<br />When you connect your cable modem to the router, all PCs connected to the router get an IP address from the provider, yes? Did you connect it to the WAN port or to one of the LAN ports? If you connected it to the WAN port and your network behaved that way, you may want to try something else...link: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953</a></p><p>Yes, that&#039;s for a different device but it&#039;s worth a shot before opening that thing up and soldering pins onto the board. (That should be the last thing you do. I hope I never have to do that with mine.)</p>									</div>
