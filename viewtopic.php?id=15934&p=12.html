					<p>Hi!</p><p>I just registered to participate in this thread, which I&#039;m following since november or december 2010, when I searchead for OpenWRT support on my adsl router, the infamous smc7908a-isp I received about a couple of years ago from my then adsl provider, ya.com and now I have collecting dust at home. I was happy to see finally some progress was being done, so first of all I want to thank all the people involved on this, namely ngp, pippolippi, blogic, vpablos and my apologies if I&#039;ve forgotten anyone!</p><p>My progress on this... so far I&#039;ve flashed my device with ngp&#039;s experimental firmware which I got from <a href="http://personales.ya.com/_ngp_/firmware_arv4518_openwrt_bin.bz2">http://personales.ya.com/_ngp_/firmware … rt_bin.bz2</a>. It works well, I can ssh to it and access the filesystem (I was exepcting to get the HTTP interface for dummies but noticed it&#039;s not there <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue"/>), but that&#039;s all. As far as I know it lacks wifi support so it&#039;s of not much use for me. I&#039;m not in any way a Linux hacker, so now I&#039;m kinda lost and I don&#039;t know how to continue. Went to <a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/ifxmips/">http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/ifxmips/</a> and downloaded every file from there, but<br/>a) I don&#039;t know really how to flash my router with them, nor what file(s) should I use from there,<br/>b) as the timestamps of those files are from November 2010, I don&#039;t think the progress discussed on this thread is applied there, am I wrong?</p><p>If someone could enlight me and put some instructions from really newbies on how to get all the features you have been able to get working, or even more (I already know it is much to ask <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue"/>) put an updated firmware image to upload with the router web interface, it would make my day.</p><p>By the way, I have a kind of miscellaneous question maybe someone could also answer. Could this router potentially recognize (and take advantatge of) any kind of usb device attached to it which already have support for it in the linux kernel, not only storage devices?

					<p>Thanks pippolippi! So, in theory, is it &quot;as easy&quot; as downloading the sources from the SVN address you provide and compiling them, then installing the image (which I don&#039;t know in what format will be)? I suppose I can do the last from my current &quot;testing&quot; OpenWRT version in the router itself, or I could try the tftp method.</p><p>I don&#039;t understand the change in the target. Aren&#039;t them different architectures? Why it was ifxmips then and lantiq now?? I wouldn&#039;t have figured that ever by myself. And in theory, all the enhancements archieved in this thread sould be applied in the SVN copy, that is, a working, full OpenWRT for the smc7908a?</p><p>Maybe I&#039;ll give it a try tonight, but I&#039;m not very confident I will be able to get anything. Moreover, I&#039;m on a Windows 7 computer, what makes this even more difficult. Maybe with MinGW I can compile it? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm"/></p><p>I&#039;ll post here my results whatever I get...</p>									</div>

					<p>An interesting patch has been sent by Luca Olivetti to openwrt-devel. It says:</p><p>The following patch improves the support for the arv7518pw:</p><p>- it defines the gpio to activate the usb (it was in a previous patch, still <br/>&nbsp; unapplied)<br/>- adds support for the wifi chip (ath9k)<br/>- defines a specific profile for the arv7518<br/>- doesn&#039;t trash the command line parameters set in uboot</p><p>I could only test wifi in station mode and in the g band, and, while it<br/>works, the performance is atrocious, however nobody helped so I cannot do<br/>better.<br/>Oh, and it needs the patch to mac80211 that I posted previously.</p><p>More at&nbsp; <a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2011-February/009733.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 09733.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I have compiled succesfully lantiq-xway target for arv4518, but I don&#039;t know at the moment how to flash it without a serial cable and without the risk of bricking it. I guess the way is to flash it keeping the brn loader, as explained before, so brn loader calls a second loader (uboot) and it starts OpenWrt. Anyway, instructions are not clear enough. I don&#039;t know the way to get RAM image needed (is it uImage file?) and the special config for uboot to get loaded from brn loader.</p><p>The other way would be to flash the boot loader with uboot, but as far as I could understand, it doesn&#039;t have an &quot;emergency&quot; way of flashing the router without a serial cable, does it?</p><p>Any help around? I don&#039;t understand why there is so few documentation for flashing, as it could help much to give feedback to developers.</p><p>Greetings!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m in no way an expert, and I already replaced brn boot with u-boot, but the bootloader is in package/uboot-lantiq.<br/>I think you should select the package &quot;uboot-lantiq-arv4518PW_brnboot&quot; so that it will produce a second stage bootloader, combine this bootloader with the kernel and the rootfs using the tool posted by ngp a while ago, and it should produce a file flashable with the standard web interface.<br/>See here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=119919#p119919">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 19#p119919</a><br/>and here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=119986#p119986">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 86#p119986</a></p><p>If it doesn&#039;t work you can always go back to the original firmware using the emergency firmware upload page.</p><p>I suggest you get a serial cable and try without flashing anything: generate an &quot;uboot-lantiq-arv4518PW_ramboot&quot; uboot, load with zmodem using brn, then load openwrt via tftpboot (if you generated the image with the ramdisk option). It&#039;s not easy but it surely won&#039;t brick your device.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have flashed arv4518 with an image made with the C code that paste together the files needed:<br/>1st and 2nd files: uboot extracted with SP700ex from testing image sent by ngp (unscrambled but not lzma uncompressed)<br/>3rd file: openwrt-lantiq-xway-ARV4518PW-uImage (the only image compiled when OpenWRT is compiled with ramimage option enabled in make menuconfig settings). I didn&#039;t choose to lzma the file, should I?<br/>4th and 5th files: 0 bytes files created with touch command</p><p>It seems that uboot manages to start, but OpenWRT fails because I get a &quot;Failsafe UI&quot;, different than default one from brn bootloader.</p><p>I did this way because flashing from failsafe interface from brn loader the test image uploaded by ngp doesn&#039;t work for me. I tried to reach the router at several IP&#039;s and I didn&#039;t get any answer.</p><p>Does anyone have a hint to go further with OpenWRT?</p><p>Bye!<br/>Santi</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe the uboot you used isn&#039;t suitable for your board and cannot find the kernel. Uboot has a failsafe ui too, so maybe that&#039;s what you&#039;re seeing.<br/>The only way to know for sure what happens during boot is with a serial console.</p>									</div>
