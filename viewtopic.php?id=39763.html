					<p>Questions about running Squeezeslave on OpenWrt pop up from time to time in various forae, so I figured I&#039;d capture my latest experiments for public consumption.&nbsp; All of them involve the squeezeslave-oss_1.2-r365 package most appropriate for the router/OpenWrt combination in question, downloaded from:</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/squeezeslave/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/squeezeslave/downloads/list</a></p><p>I built all OpenWrt images locally in order to bundle all required custom drivers (USB, audio, wireless).</p><p>1.&nbsp; Asus WL-500W</p><p>SUCCESSFUL</p><p>OpenWrt ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (Bleeding Edge, r33527)<br />Squeezeslave Attitude Adjustment brcm47xx package<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/files/squeezeslave-oss_1.2-r365AA_brcm47xx.ipk">http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/file … cm47xx.ipk</a></p><p>The 500W&#039;s oddball draft-N Broadcom 4321 radio was always an issue in the past, limiting the box to brcm-2.4 and the proprietary Broadcom drivers.&nbsp; I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find that trunk (b43 driver) fully supports the stock radio now, opening a whole new range of updated applications.&nbsp; Squeezeslave works perfectly.</p><p>2.&nbsp; Asus WL-500W &amp; TP-LINK TL-WN861N</p><p>SUCCESSFUL</p><p>OpenWrt ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (Bleeding Edge, r33527)<br />Squeezeslave Attitude Adjustment brcm47xx package<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/files/squeezeslave-oss_1.2-r365AA_brcm47xx.ipk">http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/file … cm47xx.ipk</a></p><p>One good thing about the 500W is that it&#039;s easy to swap out the mini PCI radio card for this well-supported Atheros card (ath9k).&nbsp; This was mandatory if you wanted to run brcm47xx and the 2.6.x kernel.&nbsp; Swapping radios is thankfully no longer necessary, but trunk + ath9k still works great.&nbsp; Squeezeslave works perfectly.</p><p>3.&nbsp; TP-LINK TL-MR3020</p><p>SUCCESSFUL</p><p>OpenWrt ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (Bleeding Edge, r33395)<br />Squeezeslave Attitude Adjustment ar71xx package<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/files/squeezeslave-oss_1.2-r365AA_ar71xx.ipk">http://squeezeslave.googlecode.com/file … ar71xx.ipk</a></p><p>This tiny little box, along with the USB sound card, fits in less than a 5&quot;x3&quot;x1&quot; space.&nbsp; It was my easiest OpenWrt + Squeezeslave installation by far.&nbsp; Frankly I was surprised at how easily I got this working right out of the box.&nbsp; The only gotcha I can think of is that TP-LINK doesn&#039;t provide anything like Asus&#039; wonderful firmware recovery mode, so if I accidentally bricked this one I&#039;d have to solder a serial connection.&nbsp; Luckily that never became a problem.&nbsp; Squeezeslave works perfectly.</p><p>If you are buying new, this is the one to get.&nbsp; Since it&#039;s limited to 4M flash it&#039;s not a perfect hacking platform, but it has a lot of RAM for specific applications.</p><p>4.&nbsp; Asus WRT-520GU</p><p>NOT SUCCESSFUL</p><p>I won&#039;t bore you with a detailed list of my tries, suffice to say that the only firmware I could get to stream music reliably with this platform is MightyOhm&#039;s original base (Kamikaze r12857 + mpc &amp; mpd packages):</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://mightyohm.com/files/kamikaze-2.4/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://mightyohm.com/files/kamikaze-2.4 … uashfs.trx</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://mightyohm.com/files/kamikaze-2.4/packages/mipsel/">http://mightyohm.com/files/kamikaze-2.4 … es/mipsel/</a></p><p>AA trunk r33527 brcm47xx &amp; b43 kinda-sorta works, as it lets me install the corresponding Squeezeslave package and even associates with my WLAN.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the wireless link goes Tango Uniform as soon as I start a music stream.&nbsp; Tried other combinations (Backfire, including brcm-2.4) to no avail.&nbsp; Either the wireless was unstable or MP3 decoding caused a lot of dropouts.&nbsp; Seems odd to me as I&#039;d expect this Broadcom radio to be a lot more popular (and therefore better supported) than the 500Ws radio.&nbsp; I would not recommend buying this one, it&#039;s too bad as this router can regularly be found on sale.</p>									</div>
