					<p>Hi wbx,</p><p>maybe there is a misunderstanding. My posting to the OpenWRT developer forum was the 3rd effort<br />to support a Sinus port of OpenWRT and to make my patches known to people who can integrate<br />them in OpenWRT. Please feel free to contact me (weil at mail.berlios.de, sw_ in IRC)<br />if you have questions or want to discuss the matter (you may write in german).</p><p>My Berlios project is not limited to OpenWRT - I first wanted to start with eCOS because it uses<br />less ressources and might try it some day. So you are completely wrong with your reasoning.</p><p>All patches are available at <a href="http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/openwrt/">http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/openwrt/</a> - it would be really nice<br />if you could have a look on these patches and take at least some of them to integrate them in<br />OpenWRT. </p><p>Regards<br />Stefan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sw</strong> on 21 Sep 2005, 21:10)</p>

I am willing to help, but cannot do it myself because<br />I&#039;m not an official OpenWrt developer.</p><p>This new Sinus port uses an NFS root filesystem, but can<br />be easily modified to boot from SQUASHFS.

					<p>According to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a> , DSL-G664T and Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE<br />both use the same kind of WLAN interface (TI ACX111 connected via VLYNQ).</p><p>So it will only work with patches for the VLYNQ interface.</p><p>The patch for the Sinus router contains patches which are specific for Sinus (and other<br />routers with the same bootloader), and it contains working patches for the VLYNQ interface.<br />You will have to separate both kinds of patches (which is not too difficult).</p><p>In addition to the patches, you will need a driver.

					<p>For proper WiFi support, we should probably focus on developing the Linux 2.6 port for AR7. The ACX100 driver doesn&#039;t have any support for Linux 2.4, and I doubt that adding it would be worth it. <br />I think z3ro and some other guy have gotten it to the point where it boots, but ethernet is still very unreliable. I will probably start working on a new ethernet driver without all that HAL crap soon.</p>									</div>

I downloaded a copy of the firmware source code <a href="ftp://ftp.linksys.com/opensourcecode/wrtp54g/WRTP54G_v1.00.60.tgz">v1.00.60</a> from Linksys FTP site. Unfortunately, the source code firmware package doesn&#039;t come with the needed toolchains to compile the source. I went to <a href="http://buildroot.uclic.org">BuildRoot</a> to download the buildroot package; however, I just don&#039;t know which ARM processor Type, i.e. Generic Arm, Arm 610, Arm 710, Arm 7TDMI, Arm 720T, Arm 920T, Arm 922T, Arm 926T, Arm 1136JF, etc., to select to compile the toolchains. Perhaps, you can help me out here.</p><p>BTW, how much is this aDSL hardware currently sold on the market? Perhaps, I should get one locally here in the US.</p>									</div>

					<p>Please note that AR7 and ARM are totally different platforms:<br />AR7 is a MIPS based system, so you cannot use an ARM<br />toolchain.</p><p>The discussion was confused by the fact that T-Com released<br />different hardware under the label &quot;T-Sinus 154&quot;, some routers<br />using ARM based processors, other AR7 / MIPS based processors.</p><p>For AR7, just take the latest version of OpenWrt (SVN trunk).<br />It will build the necessary tools - see the documentation of<br />OpenWrt for details.</p><p>Stefan</p>									</div>
