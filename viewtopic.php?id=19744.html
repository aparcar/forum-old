					<p>Hi There,</p><p>I am currently using the 8.09/brcm47xx/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin firmware on my WRT54G-V2.0 and am experiencing some wifi stability problems. I have seen other people with similar issues running kernel 2.6 firmware on broadcom chips, but haven&#039;t been able to find a definitive answer.</p><p>The problem is that under conditions of moderate to heavy load (for example streaming video over wireless), my wireless connection drops and the router needs to be rebooted before anyone can connect to wifi again. This was happening much more frequently using WPA-PSK/TKIP but still happens at least every 10-15 minutes (under load) with WPA2-PSK/AES.</p><p>When I go to the system page in luci I notice that although I am using a brcm47xx firmware, my router actually is using the Broadcom BCM3302 V0.7 chip. I thought the V2 used a brcm47xx chip... Maybe I am mistaken? Could this be the source of my problems?</p><p>Also, does anyone know if using one of the kernel 2.4 builds of kamikaze could alleviate this issue?</p><p>Thanks for the knowledge,<br />Stephen</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I switched from WhiteRussian to Kamikaze 8.09 kernel 2.6 on my WRT54Gv2.2 just a few days ago and did not experience any wifi instabilities. Maybe I did not produce enough traffic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Have a look: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19464">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19464</a><br />The latest trunk seems to work stable.</p><p>Don&#039;t worry: you have a brcm47xx chip. Broadcom BCM3302 V0.7 is the CPU (as far as I know...).</p><p>Hmm, you can try kernel 2.4 but for me the &quot;felt performance&quot; of 2.6 is way better...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Netzfetz</strong> on 9 Apr 2009, 18:50)</p>
