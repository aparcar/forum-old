					<p>I have set up a 3G system for my car with an old VIA C3, a Huawei e220 and of course OpenWRT with Josefsson&#039;s writeup here: <a href="http://josefsson.org/openwrt/dongle.html">http://josefsson.org/openwrt/dongle.html</a></p><p>Everything works except for one thing: When I start the box, it will start with WAN (the Huawei) deactivated. I can activate it in two ways: Either change something (anything, really) on the WAN configuration page and click &quot;save and apply&quot; or by activating it on the Interfaces page and click &quot;save and apply&quot;. It will be online within seconds. But this is of course a pain in the you know what, especially since this box will have to be turned off when not in use, both to avoid a lot of unnecessary data traffic and not to drain the car&#039;s battery when it&#039;s parked. Does anybody have a good idea here?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Woops... That one I did not see. I only saw the script that was meant to activate the serial ports, and they were activated. I thought that script only was for when you wanted to keep the regular broadband connection as the &quot;real&quot; connection. But now it works flawlessly.

					<p>I&#039;ve only followed that howto as well, so we&#039;re getting beyond my experience unfortunately. I&#039;m guessing the dongle is still in the process of trying to sign into the network when the script tells it to go online, and after it fails to connect it just gives up. This is a shot in the dark, but try editing /etc/config/network and adding the line</p><p>option ppp_redial persist</p><p>to the wan configuration bit. I assume that&#039;ll make it keep trying to establish the connection if it&#039;s down or fails to connect for whatever reason. (I haven&#039;t tested this)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, but that did not help. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I prefer to work in GUI, so I opened the network configuration file in Ubuntu and added the line. Then I did what Dogge said (are we talking a fellow molosser owner here?) in Telnet. It still works after a nice reboot or a nice shutdown, but not when I pull the plug and put it in again.</p>									</div>

					<p>That may be a different problem. Now my log reads: &quot;Timeout checking for PIN.wan (3g): Failed to set the PIN code.&quot; And I don&#039;t have a PIN code on that SIM.</p><p>Edit: I only saw that PIN code thing once.

					<p>More and more confusing...

					<p>I had the &#039;Timeout: failed to set the PIN code&#039; error when experimenting with my modem this weekend too. It turns out the PIN code bit is irrelevant, the error is because commands being sent to the modem are timing out without a reply. In my case this was because <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22153">a previous connection was still active</a>, but mileage (and causes) may vary...</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting! Maybe the modem occasionally tries to connect before the connection is ready. Anyway I&#039;m a lot closer now, it connects correctly most of the time. I did a full setup from the ground again, and it seemed to help. I probably had messed around with too many different scripts and packages...</p>									</div>
