					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>I use a 200MBit/s Cable Connection with native ipv4. My last Router was not able to use BarrierBreaker because it&#039;s cpu is too slow. So I decided to get a new one. I prefer to use an TP-Link because they&#039;re cheap and good. The OpenWRT-Wiki doesnt help me really. So maybe the forum-gurus can help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

C5 1.0 works fine but not sure about any others. </p><p>That said, if you are trying to use QoS/SQM with shaping on a 200mbps internet connection, you will still struggle with the CPU in all of these. At this time, you&#039;d probably need an x86 box to handle those speeds with traffic shaping/QoS/SQM. Without those features turned on, you *might* be able to get 200mbps out of an Archer C7.</p>									</div>
