					<p>Is there a way to run time based authentication?</p><p>I am looking to be able to generate time-limited logins. E.g. a password should be valid for 30 minutes from the time it is issued.</p><p>The way I see it, on a Windows machine, I will use powershell to convert the date/time timestamp to a string and print it. Then, when the user enters the password on the authentication page, it would be converted back to the time stamp on the OpenWRT router, so the router will grant or deny access based on that time stamp.</p><p>Can this be done? Or any other ideas?</p>									</div>
