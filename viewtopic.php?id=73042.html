					<p>I want to create my own firmware for Tp-Link TL-WR740N V2 and i have the config files saved from the router. The only part i am unsure about is how to disable firewall within the firmware itself. My configuration depends on disabling firewall so if i dont disable the firewall i cant connect to the remote router. Is there any way to disable the firewall so when i flash the firmware it doesn&#039;t start on the boot? I know about the &quot;init.d firewall disable&quot; but how can i execute it when the router boots up after the firmware flash. Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I have not testeded this, but this could work:</p><p>git clone openwrt (or git pull, if you already have it cloned)<br />./scrpits/feeds/update -a and install -a<br />Either 1. you can compile without firewall package (uncheck firewall in menuconfig) in case you won&#039;t need firewall at all (dumb ap),<br />or 2. you can edit the default firewall:<br />vi package/network/config/firewall/files/firewall.config<br />where I&#039;d uncomment<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># port redirect of remapped ssh port (22001) on wan
config redirect

You can even flash router with factory firmware this way. Also config compiled to firmware will survive reset to defaults (firstboot).</p><p>rc.local approach is also possible, it is located in package/base-files/files/etc/rc.local (add /etc/init.d/firewall stop), but it does not make much sense to let firewall start by default and stop it right away.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t disagree that it isn&#039;t efficient to stop the firewall, right after it starts, but in the larger scheme of things, it isn&#039;t a big thing (unless you are rebooting your router every 5 minutes).</p>									</div>
