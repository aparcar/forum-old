					<p>Hello, </p><p>I did a few quick searches and couldn&#039;t really come up with anything concrete, so I thought it might be quicker to just post a small topic.</p><p>My room mate and I share an internet connection, and it is a fairly crappy connection.&nbsp; If one of us is downloading/uploading ANYTHING, it slows the connection to a crawl for the other user.&nbsp; Is there any way to throttle both the upload/download traffic of a specific IP or MAC address?</p><p>For example:</p><p>192.168.0.5 gets 50k/sec up, 50k/sec down<br />192.168.0.6 gets 50k/sec up, 50k/sec down</p><p>Thank you very much,</p><p>pSc</p><p>Edit: Spelling</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pseudoschizo</strong> on 17 May 2006, 23:33)</p>
