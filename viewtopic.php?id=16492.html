					<p>I need a wireless router that will support both the Verizon (Sierra Wireless) 595 and the AT&amp;T (Option) GT Ultra PCMCIA cards. I see Linksys makes two separate models for AT&amp;T and Verizon, but I don&#039;t want to buy one of each. If I use the OpenWRT firmware, can I have the same router for both cards (one at a time, of course), with just a change of configuration? If so, which model of the WRT54G3G should I buy to start with? AT&amp;T, Sprint or Verizon?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
