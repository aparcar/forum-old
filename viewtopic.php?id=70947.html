					<p>Hello,</p><p>This is my 1st message here, i&#039;m new to OpenWRT.<br />I have some knowledge in networking but more or less nothing in linux.</p><p>I have Openwrt on a PC, to run Overthebox product from OVH.</p><p>Overthebox gives me the way to aggregate WAN connection (adsl, 4G) to get redundancy and to increase my bandwidth.</p><p>My WAN routers are the box provided by the ISP and an USB dongle for 4G connectivity.</p><p>As i have a lot of problems with my ISP, i would like to monitor and log the link failures.</p><p>My idea is to send a ping (interval to determine, around 5 seconds) to the WAN IP interface of the box.<br />If the IP is dead =&gt; write the date and time in a log file<br />When the IP is back alive =&gt; write date and time</p><p>2 questions :<br />-is it the wrong way to monitor and log these failures ?<br />-how to implement it ?</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>									</div>

					<p>you certainly could write a shell script to do this, openwrt also has keepalived that can automatically switch routers when one goes down.&nbsp; Not really sure what you are wanting to do at the end.</p><p>If you are only wanting to monitor the connection there are tons of windows based freeware out there that does this already.</p>									</div>

					<p>the goal is to have a log file where i can find when my connection state changed :</p><p>something like that :</p><p>2017-05-18-21h42-down<br />2017-05-18-21h45-up<br />...</p><p>i guess there are lot of freewares that could do that on windows, but the goal is to have it running on OpenWRT, as it&#039;s always running, while my Windows PC could be switch off</p><p>I&#039;ve found this :<br />/viewtopic.php?pid=178368#p178368</p><p>i think it&#039;s almost the same as i want, but i have no idea how to use this script<br />i guess i have to create a file whith these lines,but i don&#039;t know how to run it, how to have it started automatically at startup, how to check the logfile</p>									</div>

					<p>copy and paste it to a file on your pc<br />scp it to your router /tmp <br />chmod to make it executable<br />copy/move it somewhere permanent<br />add it to /etc/rc.local so it runs every time router boots redirecting output to a logfile you choose (make sure you don&#039;t fill the filesystem and crash the router)</p><br /><p>those are the basic steps anyways</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WWTK</strong> on 18 May 2017, 23:09)</p>

					<p>OK, solved, thanks a lot WWTK, that was the missing point.</p><p>I&#039;ve changed the script to reach my goal.<br />Here it is :</p><p>#!/bin/sh</p><p>host1=&quot;109.xx.yy.zz&quot;<br />aliveDate=&quot;0&quot;</p><p>while [ 1 ]<br />do<br />date=`date &quot;+%Y-%m-%d`<br />if !
