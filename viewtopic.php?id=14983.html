					<p>Back in the old days (before 7.09 was released), there was a download directory called &quot;snapshots&quot; - I even recall seeing the schedule of what had been built (and whether or not the compilation was error-free), and when the next build was due.&nbsp; Is that entirely gone now? Feel free to call me lazy, but I was quite happy to reap the benefits of other people&#039;s work!</p><p>Sadly Missed: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/brcm47xx-2.6">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/brcm47xx-2.6</a></p>									</div>

					<p>The buildbot that populated the snapshots dir broke shortly before the 7.09 release. It remained broken and images became quite out of date. I removed the snapshots images after the uclibc upgrade as it broke binary compatibility with the old packages.&nbsp; Stale potentially unstable images deal more harm than good in my opinion as the primary purpose of the snapshots was to get the latest code out there and tested.</p>									</div>

Just be sure to update to get the latest source before you compile (i.e. <em>svn up</em>, <em>./scripts/feeds update</em>, <em>make defconfig</em>, <em>make package/symlinks</em>, and perhaps a <em>make menuconfig</em> in your OpenWRT SVN source tree).</p>									</div>

Believe it or not, I have more experience than I need at porting and cross-compiling (If anyone here read <em>Unix World</em> magazine in the late 1980s, you might&#039;ve seen my article), and I&#039;d rather not go through the exercise of svn, disk space, menuconfig, and pickiness about which version of gcc breaks the code. I don&#039;t bake my own bread, sew my own clothes, or build my own Linux kernels, either. As I said, I&#039;m very happy that there are people who are willing and able to put their time and energy into that, I&#039;m just hoping that they&#039;ll share their work with us lazy folks.</p>									</div>
