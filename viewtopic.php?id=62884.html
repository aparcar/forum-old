					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>i have got a big problem concerning the named router. I was able to flash it succesfully and was able to get access to the router via LuCI. Unfortunately i deleted the LAN Connection in the settings. Now i&#039;m not able to get access via the LAN Port. The WLAN Network still exists as I see it via the iPhone and my laptop but i&#039;m not able to get access as well. So what would be the next steps. Am I able to resuce my router?:) I would be very glad if someone could help me</p>									</div>
