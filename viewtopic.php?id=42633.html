					<p>Hello All, </p><p>Possibly someone can advise. I have installed Open WRT on an MR3020, and then got beyond step 15 in installing piratebox. </p><p>My router downloaded the appropriate files via the web and installed them, but the proceeded to download and install the same files over and over again. I waited 15 minites for whatever was happening to complete, and when it didn&#039;t I cycled power to the router.</p><p>Piratebox initally appeared to functiom, in so far as I could connect to it via wireless lan, but did not redirect my browser to the piratebox &#039;home page&#039;. I ssh&#039;d back into the router, and after poking around, attempted to reinstall piratebox by first removing it with opkg.</p><p>This has left me with a router that I can access only in failsafe mode. By doing mount_root, I can edit the network config file, but after rebooting it, I cannot access the router via ssh using the default address 192.168.1.1 or my chosen address 192.168.1.111.</p><p>The device does still appear as an open network on wifi, but I cannot connect to it.</p><p>Can anyone assist me please?.</p><p>Regards</p><p>Peter</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>peter.evans</strong> on 2 Mar 2013, 19:30)</p>
