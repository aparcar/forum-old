					<p>I&#039;ve ported the broadcom-sdhc driver (which was based on the old &quot;optimized mmc&quot; driver) to kernel 2.6 and improved the startup scripts. You should get significantly more reliable SD card support and performance compared to the mmc_over_gpio driver.</p><p>In theory, this should work with any WRT54G/GL with the sd card mod. I have no idea if this works on any other Broadcom platform, if you&#039;re feeling adventurous, try it out and let me know here!</p><p>This works on my WRT54GL with the SD card mod with:<br />data in on gpio 2<br />data out on gpio 4<br />clock on gpio 3<br />chip select on gpio 7</p><p>I&#039;m not responsible if this bricks your router etc. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>This should work on any relatively recent trunk/snapshot, and maybe even 10.04-rc4.

					<p>Just jumping in here to say that I had been struggling trying to get SD card support working under 2.6 for a couple days.&nbsp; I could get the GPIOs to toggle from the diag driver but the mmc_over_gpio just would not do anything.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t even get it to work with no other kernel modules loaded.&nbsp; </p><p>I built a firmware with your driver installed and it worked like a charm for one of the other Wrt users.

					<p>I&#039;ve tested the driver with latest trunk from 20 Aug, 2011. In the log files it says the SD card (2GB Kingston) is recognized and there are no errors. I see the device and the partition added to the &quot;/dev&quot;. However the &quot;mount&quot; command hangs forever. I&#039;m having &quot;ext2&quot; file system on the card, so I had&nbsp; &quot;ext4&quot; driver, which should work with ext2 as well. My schematic is the same:<br />data in on gpio 2<br />data out on gpio 4<br />clock on gpio 3<br />chip select on gpio 7<br />I&#039;m using the opensource broadcom driver and I have changed &quot;/etc/modules.d/30-b43&quot; accordingly. I rebooted the router and then the &quot;broadcom_sdhc26 start&quot; script did not work anymore: it was giving me some error that the file is already there and the stop script failed as well with the same error as reported by others: &quot;rmmod: can&#039;t unload &#039;bcm_sdhc&#039;: Resource temporarily unavailable&quot;<br />I tested with Backfire RC5 2.4 kernel with the old &quot;optimized mmc&quot; driver - the card mounted fine and the speed was great. However I&#039;d like to use the latest kernel (the trunk is on 3.0.3). <br />I was able to mount the card on 2.6 kernel with the &quot;mmc_over_gpio&quot; driver, but I get a terribly slow transfer speed and the systems hangs shortly afterward.<br />Zinc, thank you very much for working on this. Please let me know if there is a new version that I can test.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello !</p><p>I count mount an existing ext2 partition without problem. I can also list my complete partition table, which I couldn&#039;t before...<br />Nevertheless, I&#039;m unable to format a partition in ext2. It always ends up closing my telnet/ssh remote session without even finishing the job...<br />I might be because the CPU is too busy and can&#039;t answer the SSH/telnet session fast enough...</p><p>Therefore, I coulnd&#039;t try the extroot as I&#039;m unable to format the partition to do so <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Anyway, that&#039;s a good step forward !

If you telnet in, and background the mkfs command, does it eventually start responding again? Alternatively, you can mkfs it on your desktop then just stick the card in.</p><p>It probably is the CPU being too busy, I took out the interrupt code because of some issues with it -- so I guess your use case is a good reason to do the kthreads version.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi zinc,<br />the driver works fine on my WRT54GL v1.1 using a 2GB SanDisk microSD card. The speed is about 600kB/s, which is great! <br />However, as soon as I use it with extroot pivot overlay (setting the &#039;preinit&#039; option in /etc/config/broadcom_sdhc26 to 1) the SD card gets very slow with a r/w speed of only about 25 kB/s. </p><br /><p>I compiled the broadcom-sdhc26-2 sources to a package for Backfire 10.03.1.
