					<p>I&#039;ve upgraded my wl-hdd to Kamikaze, and now I&#039;m trying to get my beloved bridged-client mode (wl0_mode=wet) up and running again. I&#039;ve just spotted a:</p><p>wlhdd user.info : wl0(cfg2): Invalid mode</p><p>in the log, and I&#039;ve also noticed that /lib/wifi/broadcom.sh doesn&#039;t contain an option for wet<br />(which worked perfectly for my setup under white russian).</p><p>Does anyone know if it&#039;s gone for good, or is it just waiting for someone to implement it?</p><p>Thanks, Jaime</p>									</div>
