					<p>I have a modified TP-Link TL-WR740N router with flash and RAM upgraded to 8mb and 64mb respectively. It has the AR9331 SOC. This is what the system page on 192.168.1.1 shows:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>System<br />Hostname&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt<br />Model&nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link TL-WR740N/ND v5<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r42406 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10522)<br />Chip Model&nbsp; &nbsp; Atheros AR9330 rev 1<br />CPU frequency&nbsp; &nbsp; 400MHz<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.10.49<br />Local Time&nbsp; &nbsp; Sun Sep 28 23:00:32 2014<br />Uptime&nbsp; &nbsp; 0h 2m 15s<br />Load Average&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.50, 0.33, 0.13System<br />Hostname&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt<br />Model&nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link TL-WR740N/ND v5<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r42406 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10522)<br />Chip Model&nbsp; &nbsp; Atheros AR9330 rev 1<br />CPU frequency&nbsp; &nbsp; 400MHz<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.10.49<br />Local Time&nbsp; &nbsp; Sun Sep 28 23:00:32 2014<br />Uptime&nbsp; &nbsp; 0h 2m 15s<br />Load Average&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.50, 0.33, 0.13</p></blockquote></div><p>The problem is that I want to install the package &quot;mentohust&quot; on this router to be able to access the internet in my dorm in my Chinese University through WiFi. Dorms are only provided with Ethernet outlets which can be used to plug into laptops. The laptop needs a software to able to access the internet. Without a properly configured openwrt router with mentohust package installed, one&#039;s only option is to use the laptop&#039;s internal wifi as a hotspot. Which, you might have guessed, is quite inconvenient.</p><p>There is a lot of info available on the openwrt chinese website. I have gleaned through a lot of websites to be able to understand and figure out how to do it but I have always hit a wall. For example:</p><p>I downloaded the files available in this blog post:<br /><a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_64cd9df90101a452.html">http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_64cd9df90101a452.html</a></p><p>I followed the instructions as good as I could and copied the files to the root of the router using scp command. Opkg install does not work. It throws errors like the architecture is different or not compatible. The article was published in 2012 so I guess the files are not compatible with Barrier Breaker.</p><p>I tried to follow this link:<br /><a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_61a9cc7a0101rg2b.html">http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_61a9cc7a0101rg2b.html</a><br />He seemed to have the same problem as me but as he figures it out, I can&#039;t follow him.</p><p>Then there is this guy:<br /><a href="http://www.openwrt.org.cn/bbs/thread-13591-1-1.html">http://www.openwrt.org.cn/bbs/thread-13591-1-1.html</a><br />He seems to have the whole package. A custom built firmware for my router with mentohust built-in. Notwithstanding two days of pulling my hair, I am not able to receive an activation email to verify my account and download the given files. Maybe the Chinese sites don&#039;t like gmail or outlook.</p><p>Some more info can be found here:<br /><a href="http://www.openwrt.org.cn/bbs/archiver/?tid-2612.html&amp;page=1">http://www.openwrt.org.cn/bbs/archiver/ â€¦ amp;page=1</a></p><p>Of course all the links are in Chinese which is the biggest hurdle. I am learning it but I am in the second week of my language class. If anybody could please have a look and suggest something useful, I will really appreciate it. Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mirzahadi</strong> on 18 Mar 2015, 12:07)</p>
