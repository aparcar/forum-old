					<p>I know I have to use factory.bin ...<br />I have tried them, it doesn&#039; t work..<br />I get the above error</p><p>I think it might be that protection they say about the firmware file having a certain checksum and that checksum being included somewhere in the header file. I read someone saying it on DD-WRT forum about this router.<br />I have this router version 1 and v3<br />v1 works nicely on openwrt, v3 I can&#039; t flash it</p><p>I am still beginning on openwrt and I am reading the docs and will try my first build in one of these days.<br />But if any of you can assist me with that(flashing the WR740N v3) I&#039; d be very grateful<br />;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>So you tried the trunk firmware for v3 model (not the backfire 10.03.1 as it does not support v3) and it still does not flash. Am I right?<br />If so, I guess this is a bug. Wiki says that it is supported since r28269. This file, in theory, should be accepted by factory web interface:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr740n-v3-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a></p><p>BTW, you cannot use v1 firmware for v3 router. Well, you may use u-boot tftp flash method in order to overcome the factory<br />checks.</p><p>Check older forum topics for this model and also bug reports about v3. It may have important information.</p>									</div>
