					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I am sure that I am missing something really simple, but in the latest x86 snapshot there are pre-compiled images for x86:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/x86/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/x86/</a></p><p>In the packages folder:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/x86/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a></p><p>There are packages marked x86 and i386.&nbsp; If I take an image that is compiled on 8.09.1 (custom) - it only accepts i386&nbsp; marked packages.&nbsp; In fact, all of the 8.09(.1) packages are marked i386.&nbsp; </p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/x86/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … /packages/</a></p><p>So, what is the difference?&nbsp; And if I am compiling off the latest trunk, what setting do I need to set in the &quot;make menuconfig&quot; that will mark these for i386 so my packages will working with previous builds?&nbsp; This seems to be a change since 8.09.1.</p><p>Again, I am sure that I am missing something simple, but I can&#039;t seem to find an explanation anywhere.&nbsp; I want to compile off the latest, but I don&#039;t know what setting to change to get the packages to compile with i386, not x86.&nbsp; Thanks!</p><p>Spencer</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slthomason</strong> on 15 Sep 2009, 17:29)</p>
