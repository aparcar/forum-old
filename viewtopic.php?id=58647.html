					<p>Devices with 16Mb RAM, as the original Linksys WRT54G, were fully supported and working fine until Backfire 10.03.1.</p><p>There is a forum Topic about running Barrier Breaker 14.07 on WRT54GL:<br />&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51729">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51729</a><br />In that Topic a new feature; zram is mentioned. zram is now part of 15.05 and I decided to give it a try.</p><p>What I find (with my WRT54GL):<br /> - The standard CC images are too big to fit on a typical (WRT54GL) flash<br /> - The image builder can easily generate smaller images (including zram-swap, excluding LuCl, WiFi-drivers, ppp-stuff)<br /> - zram-swap is of no significant advantage for this class of devices<br /> - opkg fails to install packages due to lack of memory<br /> - sysupgrade is really hard to run, due to lack of memory<br /> - WiFi (b43/b43legacy) does not practially work (I had some success without encryption)</p><p>There are certainly good uses for a 16Mb-device that do not require WiFi.<br />Despite zram-swap, I find CC less suitable than BB for these devices.</p><p>There are 86 devices listed as supported with just 16Mb of RAM. Not all of them are brcm47xx. I don&#039;t know if other targets work better (atheros, ar7, brcm63xx, ramips, adm5120, mcs814x, ixp4xx).</p><p>I am not writing this to complain. I only want to share what someone might find useful.<br />For more reading: <a href="http://techfindings.one/archives/2075">http://techfindings.one/archives/2075</a></p><p>Anyone with more luck?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 17:19)</p>
