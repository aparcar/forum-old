					<p>I repeat, the best place to look is in your peer-to-peer SOFTWARE.</p><p>You can diddle around in the router if you wish, but the problem comes from ill-behaved client software consuming resources without end. Does your multi-thousand dollar PC have more resources than your router? Yes it does. It can open up connections like mad and leave them all hanging open. Your computer may have gigabytes of RAM, your router only has a few megs.</p><p>I find that in my P2P application with is uTorrent, limiting connections to a smal number, download to 70% and upload to 50% keeps the very fast PC from flooding the very tiny router.&nbsp; I have OpenWRT and it has the basic 5,000 table-size and I never see my P2P app using more than 300-400 entries in it.&nbsp; Muzzle your P2P app, particularly on residential ADSL lines they can be like ill-behaved dogs you have to get them under control.</p>									</div>

					<p>vincentfox,<br />Thanks, I am using uTorrent too and have the total number of connections set at 750 which should be manageable by the router my download and upload speed is set low too, but what I think is happening is that the disconnecting takes too long and uTorrent practically uses all available connections.<br />So any other solutions? <br />Do you know how to set the tcp timeout?<br />Thank you.<br />robert</p>									</div>

					<p>Doesn&#039;t the router (read: software) have some way of protecting itself from going into a frozen state; or even worse Crashing ?&nbsp; Like, say back-off buddy, you are pushing me to my limits.&nbsp; I can&#039;t take it anymore, go away ? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />&nbsp; And, not honor any more (ill-mannered) requests/connections ?&nbsp; Or, is that what its trying to do and hence ending up crashing/freezing ?</p><p>I understand these tiny, sub-$100 routers can&#039;t reach levels of a sophisticated, scalable, high-capacity professional routers, supporting mission critical, 24x7 networks.&nbsp; I thought with proper tuning/setting, linux can stay from freezing/crashing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m no linux expert - so please don&#039;t bash me if I said something wrong <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>No, the router has no way of telling the client PC if it is being abused.</p><p>In uTorrent, my global maximum number of connections is set to 130.</p><p>If you want a simple formula, I go into uTorrent &quot;Speed Guide&quot; and set it to about half of my connection capability. Like I have xxx/512k line I use the xxx/256k setting. This works well and doesn&#039;t hog the entire line so I can actually USE it for other things.</p><p>If you log onto the router and look at the connection table you can see it&#039;s utilization:</p><p># wc -l /proc/net/ip_conntrack<br />193</p><p>I repeat, it is impossible for the router with it&#039;s tiny resources to handle everything that some gigahertz PC can request of it.&nbsp; What kind of connection do you have? If it&#039;s a typical DSL line 750 seems quite a lot.&nbsp; Why do you think that P2P apps have ability to tune for speed? It is because you need to optimize the application for the realities of your connection.&nbsp; Make use of that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 11 Dec 2006, 18:21)</p>
