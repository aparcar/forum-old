					<p>Yes. The site is PW-protected, of course, but it would be nice to come up with nothing at all when browsing to it.</p><p>I&#039;m sort of following what you&#039;re saying, but the procedure doesn&#039;t use VLANs.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you must be right about that Max, though I don&#039;t know how it happened.</p><p>When I set this up and tested it last week, I connected to the new subnet, could access the Internet, correctly couldn&#039;t see any PCs in the Network section of Explorer on the non-isolated network, but could also access the router in a browser, which doesn&#039;t quite make sense now that you point that out.</p><p>Perhaps it was just in need of a restart (or a restart of the firewall), which I did do in the interim for an unrelated reason, though I had thought that &quot;applying&quot; changes when setting this up in the first place was effectively the equivalent in this case.</p>									</div>
