					<p>Hi.</p><p>I bought a cheap Netgear JWNR2010v5, it works even if I want more flexibility and the original firmware is a little flawed (doesn&#039;t show connected peripherals as usual)&nbsp; so I wanted to try OpenWRT on it, as I did on my old DG834GT (btw, I&#039;m not a complete newbie, I compiled and configured the Openwrt source on Linux with the latter router, just to tell you I am pretty sure of what I am doing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p><p>The technical specifications are chip Mediatek/Ralink mt7620n, 4 MB flash, 32 MB ram.</p><p> I didn&#039;t find a specific build for this router but I found this <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ramips/mt7620n/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … s/mt7620n/</a> so I wonder if I could try something related to this chip without the risk of router being isolated (no telnet/ssh) or, worst, bricking. </p><p>Anyway, here is the original firmware source page if someone is brave enough to have a look at:<br /><a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2649/~/netgear---open-source-code-for-programmers-">http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detai … ogrammers-</a></p><p>Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kastaldi</strong> on 22 Nov 2015, 11:02)</p>
