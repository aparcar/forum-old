					<p>I am frequently upgrading the firmware and I&#039;d like a way to backup / restore my modifications easily.<br />The LUCI built-in backup/restore function works nicely for standard features but misses my additional files.<br />I thought I could add them via the WEB UI panel, but any addition there is not retained at all.</p><p>What am I doing wrong? I&#039;d like to avoid the kludgy mtd method, if at all possible, since restoring is not as immediate as the builtin interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, maybe we should make this more obvious.<br />The reason is that uci does not allow dashes in identifiers, only 0-9, a-z, A-Z and _ are allowed.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>
