					<p>Hello,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have TP TL-WA901nd v2.3. I installed the trunk with squashfs with no issues. Till I tried to use wireless 802.11s. From search, I found that I need wpad not wpad-mini. I, also, found out that there is no more enough space to install wpad. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I downloaded the jffs2 firmware to uninstall the unneeded to free up space to install wpad.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I can not connect to the WA901nd. Nor can I ping it on 192.168.1.1.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a beginner OpenWRTer (used it before on 1 WA901nd and 1 WRTU54G-TM, that is all)<br />Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>First, many thanks for all who worked on the failsafe option<br />I telneted to the router and changed the PW.&nbsp; But something unusual to me is happening. The original (before flashing with the jffs2 firmware) IP address is 172.20.254.252. Now I can connect to the AP through 192.168.1.1 although &quot;uci show network&quot; show the IP address as 172.20.254.252. Is that expected under failsafe mode?<br />Should I use &quot;uci&quot;utility to re-enter the network address again? Or just wipe out everything as mentioned in the failsafe wiki page?<br />Thanks,<br />PS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In my case TL-WA901nd no message appeared in the tcpdump. Pressing the &quot;QSS&quot; button on the front put this AP into failsafe mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a FYI</p><p> I followed the &quot;failsafe&quot; procedure including deleteing jffs2 contents. That did not solve the issue. I used sysupgrade with the sysupgrade image. However, for some reason, that did not work either. I used syspgrade alternating &quot;factory&quot; and &quot;sysupgrade&quot; images.<br />On the forth attempt, it worked fine. Now I have my TL-WA901nd working as expected again.<br />Still, LuCI does not show options for encryption with 802.11s. Even after installing wpad module.</p><p>Best regards,</p>									</div>
