					<p>Your &quot;br-lan&quot; was bridged to eth0.1. By deleting vlan1 you dropped it out from br-lan, too. This means your routers network interface &quot;CPU&quot; (according to switch port naming) is no longer connected to the outside world. </p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv7510pw">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv7510pw</a><br />Seems there is no &quot;long press reset on boot and wait for tftp listening&quot; like some other devices have. So I guess you don&#039;t have that option on your device.</p><p>Go grab yourself a serial cable, log into the local console and either factory reset that device or reconfigure your switch.</p>									</div>
