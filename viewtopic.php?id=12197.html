					<p>Hello, I am looking for some pointers on how to set this up.</p><p>We have a lan already setup with all the normal servers (file, printing etc) and we have a dhcp server. But I would like to have the wireless router running openwrt extend the normal network with wireless. So basically all the traffic on the wireless should flow as if it is part of the lan network. So when a client connect on the wireless interface the dhcp request should be handled by the already present dhcp server.</p><p>Would bridging the wireless interface to the wan interface do this for me? If not can someone point me in the right direction?</p><p>I searched on google but can&#039;t seem to get the terminology right for it to return something useful.</p><p>Many thanks<br />Sander</p><p>EDIT: I am running kamikaze 7.06 atm</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>infirit</strong> on 22 Aug 2007, 01:16)</p>

					<p>The simplest solution, to use any WiFi router, not just OpenWRT, as AP, is to simply plug the network into one of the LAN ports, leave the WAN port unused. It is already configured to bridge LAN to WLAN.</p><p>Allmost the normal running stuff is unused, unneeded, but not in the way, the only thing you need to shut down is the dhcp server on the OpenWRT, to avoid it conflicting with your normal DHCP server.</p>									</div>
