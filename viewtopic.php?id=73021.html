					<p>I&#039;m using a TP-Link AC1750 (Archer C7) version 2 router.</p><p>I&#039;ve deployed OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 to the router and have removed wpad-mini then installed hostapd.</p><p>radio0+SSID being used for testing is configured as follows:</p><p>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11a&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;pci0000:01/0000:01:00.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;56&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;VHT20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;US&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;7&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption &#039;wpa2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option server &#039;10.0.20.12&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option key &#039;**************&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid &#039;openwrt_nps_win2012&#039;</p><p>Connections to the SSID, auth&#039;ing via PEAP/802.1X, work perfectly.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to do some deauth testing based on another Community Documentation topic thread, OpenWrt → Community Documentation → How to kick/deauth a 802.11/WiFi client.</p><p>The ubus syntax is so close to working perfectly...</p><p>ubus call hostapd.wlan0 del_client &#039;{&quot;addr&quot;:&quot;XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX&quot;, &quot;reason&quot;:23, &quot;deauth&quot;:true}&#039;</p><p>OR</p><p>ubus call hostapd.wlan0 del_client &#039;{&quot;addr&quot;:&quot;XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX&quot;, &quot;reason&quot;:15, &quot;deauth&quot;:true}&#039;</p><p>So the testing I&#039;m doing is very deauth reason code specific. I&#039;m trying to send only reason code 15 (4-way handshake timeout) or 23 (802.1X auth failed) and the client application honors only those two reason codes.</p><p>Looking at an over-the-air capture, I see the intended reason code deauth frames being sent.</p><p>But directly after that deauth frame, a 2nd deauth frame with reason code 7 (class 3 frame from non-associated station) is sent from the OpenWRT router&#039;s radio.</p><p>The client device responds to the reason code 7 deauth. And unfortunately, this breaks the client application and nullifies the testing effort.</p><p>Any idea why the reason code 7 deauth is being sent by the OpenWRT device&#039;s radio?</p><p>Any thoughts on how best to debug this behavior on the OpenWRT side?</p><p>Curious to hear what people think. Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pteeter</strong> on 18 Jan 2018, 00:05)</p>

					<p>When you del_client, one deauth frame with your reason code is sent at the client as a courtesy.&nbsp; Like any radio transmission, that frame may or may not be received.&nbsp; And if it is received, it is up to the client implementation how to act upon it.</p><p>Meanwhile at the AP, the del_client process has torn down the connection and deleted all client state information.&nbsp; A frame (other than auth request) received from the now unknown client&#039;s MAC is out of sequence and will be responded to with a deauth.</p><p>Your client should handle deauths more gracefully and attempt to re-establish a connection from scratch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks mk24, appreciate the clarification.</p><p>Was hoping this would be a different (easier + more cost efficient) solution from what I have been using - injecting custom created deauth frames.</p><p>Fun investigation but ultimately...bummer.</p>									</div>
