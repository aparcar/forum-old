					<p>I&#039;m having a really hard time figuring out how to change the keyboard layout in OpenWRT.<br />I have a (now sadly discontinued) Ben NanoNote device, and I&#039;ve installed the latest version of Barrier Breaker (3.10.49) on it from xburst/qi_lb60.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried using input-kbd from input-utils but it will not work. What I&#039;m trying to use a keymap that was present on my Debian debootstrap that I have can easily set up as a chroot on my sdcard. Why is kbd not working? Here&#039;s what I used:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>input-kbd /debian/usr/share/keymaps/bnn.kmap</code></pre></div><p>So I have the debootstrap directory mounted on /debian. I&#039;m using this in OpenWRT, not in the chroot.<br />When I do that, all of this comes up:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/dev/input/event0

There&#039;s absolutely zero documentation that I could find about configuring keyboards with the kernel. I really hope I don&#039;t have to make my own custom kernel, because that means I have to learn how to set up a cross-platform MIPS toolchain and all that nasty garbage. I would hopefully want to avoid that.</p><p>Any help?<br />Also would there be a way to perminanttly save keyboard mappings after every boot besides just a line in rc.local?</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, since there are no manual pages in OpenWRT as far as I know, I had to figure out that the correct syntax for the input-kbd command is this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>input-kbd -f /debian/usr/share/keymaps/bnn.kmap 0</code></pre></div><p>Where 0 is the device number, and I can use lsinput to figure that out. Great.<br />But the syntax of my keymap file is not correct for OpenWRT. It says:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@BenNanoNote:~# input-kbd -f /debian/usr/share/keymaps/bnn.kmap 0
/dev/input/event0
map: 58 keys, size: 64/64
parse error: keymaps 0-2,4,8-9,12,64</code></pre></div><p>Can someone please help guide me to a place where I can figure out the syntax that the file needs to be in?</p><p>EDIT:<br />Okay, so I can dump keyboard configs with <strong>input-events 0</strong>.<br />It works really oddly, just like a version of showkey, and it doesn&#039;t show any keyboard combination presses.<br />So I&#039;m wondering if I can configure the left FN key which is mapped to the LEFT_CTRL key, I think, and the AltGr key, which is the red up arrow.</p><p>Can anyone tell me if I need to install this kmod-input-matrixkmap file?<br />What will it do?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrrhq</strong> on 14 Sep 2014, 07:00)</p>

					<p>Hello?</p><p>I&#039;m still looking for a way to write my own file for input-kbd that will take in keyboard combinations. I don&#039;t know how to do this yet.<br />I may just look and see if LibreWRT has it configured, or if there&#039;s a keymap file on Qi-hardware&#039;s Website then.</p>									</div>
