					<p>Hello, </p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up client mode as follows:<br />I have a working WLAN using a Netgear MR814 AP, WLAN Channel 3, SSID &quot;HS20&quot;, Encryption WEP 64bit, no MAC address filtering. A DHCPd is running there, giving out IPs 192.168.0.x. I checked those settings using my laptop (Debian GNU/Linux), everything is working.</p><p>On my WRT54GL I am running OpenWRT White Russian RC4. I first moved /etc/init.d/S45firewall out of the way.<br />I set up the NVRAM entries for wireless networking as follows:<br />&nbsp; nvram set wl0_mode=sta<br />&nbsp; nvram set wl0_ssid=HS20<br />&nbsp; nvram set wl0_channel=3<br />&nbsp; nvram set wl0_wep=enabled<br />&nbsp; nvram set wl0_key=1<br />&nbsp; nvram set wl0_key1=0d7effb4db<br />&nbsp; nvram commit<br />&nbsp; reboot</p><p>After rebooting, a iwconfig tells me there&#039;s no WLAN connection to my Access point:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# iwconfig eth1<br />eth1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IEEE 802.11-DS&nbsp; ESSID:&quot;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode:Managed&nbsp; Frequency:2.422 GHz&nbsp; Tx-Power:19 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTS thr=2347 B&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr=2346 B<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption key:0D7E-FFB4-DB<br />root@OpenWrt:~# </p><p>iwlist scanning detects my WLAN:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# iwlist eth1 scanning<br />eth1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No scan results<br />root@OpenWrt:~# iwlist eth1 scanning<br />eth1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scan completed :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cell 01 - Address: 00:09:5B:4F:70:D4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ESSID:&quot;HS20&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel:3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quality:0/0&nbsp; Signal level:-34 dBm&nbsp; Noise level:-96 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate:1 Mb/s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate:2 Mb/s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate:5.5 Mb/s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate:11 Mb/s</p><p>Same with &quot;wl&quot;:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# wl scan<br />root@OpenWrt:~# wl scanresults<br />SSID: &quot;HS20&quot;<br />Mode: Managed&nbsp; &nbsp;RSSI: -35 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp;noise: -94 dBm&nbsp; Channel: 3<br />BSSID: 00:09:5B:4F:70:D4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Capability: ESS Pollable WEP<br />Supported Rates: [ 1(b) 2(b) 5.5 11 ]</p><p>Trying to join using wl also has no effect. Note the &quot;Invalid argument&quot; message:<br />root@OpenWrt:~# wl join HS20 key 0d7effb4db<br />root@OpenWrt:~# wl assoc<br />eth1: Invalid argument<br />Not associated. Last associated with SSID: &quot;&quot;</p><p>I tried without WEP several times, the result was the same. I also tried White Russian pre-RC5, same result, too. Master (access point) mode works fine.</p><p>A full dump of all nvram vars as well as an ifconfig dump can be found here:<br /><a href="http://nopaste.chillfactory.net/show.php?id=224">http://nopaste.chillfactory.net/show.php?id=224</a></p><p>I now tried getting that to work for hours, hopefully anyone can tell me what I&#039;m doing wrong or if there may be is a bug in the driver or somewhere else.</p><p>Thanks, <br />Stefan</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I have a similar problem but it doesn&#039;t happen constantly ... <br />Sometimes it seems that my WRT54GL doesn&#039;t associate automatically at boot and when doing so the only way to let it associate is using iwconfig ...</p>									</div>

					<p>I now also tried repeatedly to set channel/mode/key/essid using iwconfig, no success, it doesn&#039;t move <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have a WLAN card suitable for sniffing what&#039;s actually going on, I don&#039;t know if the WRT54GL doesn&#039;t even try to associate with my AP (The WLAN LED is constantly on, no flashing except once or twice while booting) or if it fails at some point.<br />Is there may be any other possibility of getting debug information or a dump of what the driver (it&#039;s closed source, isn&#039;t it?) sends to the WLAN card?</p>									</div>
