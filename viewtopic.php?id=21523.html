					<p>I have set up multiple printers, and they work ok, but if they are not on when the router is restarted, the assignment of physical printer to /dev/usb/lpxx varies.</p><p>This is a problem as I have several of the same printers with different inks in them, so even trying to look at lsusb doesnt help me as they have the same ID there.</p><p>Windows seems to be able to sort it out with something that appears to be a mac address like identifier which makes the printer permanantly appear on a set USBnnn port, despite even going onto a different USB hub even.</p><p>Is there some alternate way of setting it up so I can have a straightfoward mapping of port 90xx -&gt; this printer 90xy -&gt; this printer. Otherwise I may just have to get multiple routers to do it on which I was hoping to avoid.</p>									</div>
