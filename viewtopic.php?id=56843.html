					<p>Hello,</p><p>In the place I use to spend holidays there are some <a href="http://www.fon.com">FON</a> spots around, probably served by some neighbours.<br />As a FON community member, I&#039;m entitled to log into those spots and access the internet, but most of the times the connection is unstable and keeps failing.</p><p>I was wondering if I could use an OpenWRT router to extend the WIFI signal, but I&#039;m not sure what kind of configuration it would be.<br />I think the best would be some sort of &quot;dumy repeater&quot; that repeats the signal and don&#039;t do any login in the FON access page. I know the bandwidth would be half, but I&#039;m OK with that as long as the signal is stable.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking on re-using an old <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/fon/fonera">La Fonera Router</a> with an external antenna (placed outdoors), so I guess BB is not an option - HW not capable.</p><p>Anyone could advise if that would be possible, and if so, what configuration mode should I use?</p><p>If its not possible, could anyone with experience advise if <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/150Mbps-Mini-Wireless-Access-IEEE-b-g-n-AP-WIFI-Router-Repeater-Bridge-/271705695697?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_3&amp;hash=item3f42ebe5d1">this product</a> would do the job? (not so suitable because don&#039;t have antenna port so I can put outdoors)</p><p>BTW, I think most of the BT UK and NOS Portugal subscribers share their wifi with the community and are entitled to use other customers wifi when far from home.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>Get TPLINK WR841ND router, these devices without external antenna are pieces of junk mostly.</p><p>And create a repeater from it, here is a video tutorial - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk</a></p><p>How about creating a wiki page with detailed instuctions when you make it all work? Do you know that OpenWrt has quite good wiki pages?</p>									</div>

					<p>I can help with that subject. You can use many routers... it depends what you want to do.</p><p>I already extend the wifi using 2 methods:</p><p>1 - only one of these routers receiving and expanding the signal<br />TP-LINK WR740N<br />TP-LINK WR841ND<br />TP-LINK ARCHER C7</p><p>2 - Ubiquiti Nanostation M2 receiving the signal and one of the routers of the previous point to extend it<br />(this solution is faster)</p><p>Note: I&#039;m portuguese.</p><p>Regards,<br />P.A</p>									</div>
