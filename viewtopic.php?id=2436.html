					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to get a simple test program with lib mysqlclient to compile with mipsel-linux-uclibc, all other things I coded work fine, but it seems that when I try to include -lmysqlclient it tells me that it can not find zlib, the output it gives is</p><p>warning: libz.so.1, needed by /home/jade/temp/openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so, not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)</p><p>lib mysqlclient works fine cause the 2 error msgs after it say </p><p>/home/jade/temp/openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so: undefined reference to `uncompress&#039;<br />/home/jade/temp/openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so: undefined reference to `compress&#039;</p><p>and thats obvious since thats from zlib.</p><p>I couldnt find anything about it on the forms or wiki nor the irc logs so after some trying I figured that somebody here might know what is going wrong here, could it be i&#039;m missing an eviorment path?</p>									</div>

					<p>oke, figured it out myself at the end, for anyone that would want to know, adding -Xlinker -rpath-link etc to the compile command fixes it, i suppose it was obvious from the start <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
