The device rebooted without finish correctly, so it looks broken now?</p><p>2nd try:<br />TFTP try went much quicker!<br />But still no life in the box.</p><p>Tried the following Firmware files, all without succes:<br />- 787v_8265.bli<br />- TG787_R7447_rel.bin<br />- TG787v-8.2.5.0-TA-vdnt-d_CR.bli</p><p>Router now starts up, but after 25 pings the router reboots, something is wrong now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Time to fix it!</p><p>Found out that FW lvl is still 8.6.L.1; very fast try to get to home page before router reboots.<br />It looks like they build it quiet good thighten.</p><p>Waiting for my TTL Serial cable to arrive any day now, to monitor more closely whats happening.</p><p>Anyone has tried to re-flash such a device without the serial (or JTAG) cable, i.e. by TFTP new flash to this device? I am very interested. (Most probably i need the serial connection : )</p><p>I&#039;ll keep posting.</p><p>Regards, DG.</p>									</div>

					<p>After using the TTL 3.3V RS232 converter mostly last year for ZyXEL P-2812HNU-F1 devices.<br />Today it died using it on the TG787v, so it&#039;s MOST probably NOT 3.3V TTL serial !!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DGDodo</strong> on 30 May 2015, 18:46)</p>

					<p><strong>jebediah</strong>,</p><p>I must say i did not try it anymore after frying a TTL serial device on this box <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Have enough other devices that do work with OpenWrt, i guess i&#039;ll stay with those...<br />Maybe 4u better to buy another device which can run OpenWrt easier.</p>									</div>
