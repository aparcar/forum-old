					<p>In my case minidlna on 10.03.1 with roughly 3000 files has never crashed. Also, as long as its cache is on external hd it doesn&#039;t use that much space (less than 3 MB). The only annoyance is the lack of inotify on backfire.</p>									</div>

That&#039;s why I dumped it. Minidlna on backfire is almost unusable because it takes an hour to scan through my library. And it happens every time after router restart. In the trunk on the other hand minidlna work wery well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;ve further &quot;deep&quot; investigate about performances of minidlnaserver&nbsp; &nbsp;on my router. I&#039;ve tried to test some differente device to find the minimum power/feature needed to stream 1080p &quot;heavy&quot; movies without problem.</p><p>An older Celeron 1,3Ghz with 256MB eth 100MBit&nbsp; has failed test, as too an eeebox B202 (atom 1,6Ghz, eth 1GBit) both with with debian+minidlna 1.24.<br />Only my Intel Core Duo 2 at 2,5Ghz notebook has successfully done its job...</p><p>I’m wonder about how well my tiny ARM wl-500gp with openwrt is able to heavy work! So I googled about mini PC ARM based and..., “they live”!, <br />there are a big flow of new devices with RISC like processor.<br />And openwrt is so perfect to fit in...:easy, small, efficient, software rich.<br />I’m wrong?</p>									</div>
