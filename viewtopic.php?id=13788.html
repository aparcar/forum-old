					<p>For the Wl-500gP the prebuild image (brcm-2.4) works, so no need to compile one yourself.</p><p>According to the <a href="http://toh.openwrt.org">Table of Hardware</a> the only difference between the gP and the W is the wireless card and the number of antennas, so theoretically the image <em>should</em> also work for the 500W. But as I don&#039;t have one I can&#039;t test it, so use it at your own risk.</p><p>But as the n-mode for the wireless isn&#039;t supported yet, there is currently no difference in function between the two when using openwrt, so its up to you. Though you might get a higher wireless range with the three antennas of the 500W.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KanjiMonster</strong> on 17 Dec 2007, 12:19)</p>

					<p>OK can anybody else confirm that I can use the Image from the &quot;WL-500g Premium&quot; also for the &quot;WL-500W&quot;??</p><p>Now I don`t need the n-mode for WLAN.<br />If all other features would work like they do on the WL-500g Premium I would buy the WL-500W.<br />It has for sure a bigger range and maybe there also will be a support for the n-mode in future?</p><p>Greet`s Erich</p>									</div>

					<p>WL-500gP is good piece of hardware (I have one), but there some problems with soft. If you want to use only openwrt built in features it&#039;s good choice. For example I have unresolved problem with UMTS USB modem. So make the list of features you want and ask google before you buy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mozdyn</strong> on 18 Dec 2007, 23:00)</p>

					<p>@mozdyn<br />Do u only have the UMTS USB modem problem with the original firmware or isn`t it supported in OPENWRT too?</p><p>Are there features which are only in the original ASUS firmware which are not implemented in OpenWRT - but are great?</p><p>Is there a LIST where I can see all the features working on the ASUS with OpenWRT?<br />Or can I use a VM-Ware to install OpenWRT - to see the features?</p><p>For me important is the downloadmanager the original Firmware has. You can give a HTTP or FTP Job and the ASUS will finish downloading to the USB Harddisc!</p><p>Greet`s Erich</p>									</div>
