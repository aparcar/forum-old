					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>At first i want to say that i&#039;m begginer with openWRT and i hope that you will help me.</p><p>I have installed on my tp-link openWRT and it works great, but i want to sell my router and to do this i need original firmware. So i was tryied to install my original firmware from tp-link site, but something went wrong and now i see that my router is constantly rebooting, led&#039;s are blinking constantly, i don&#039;t have any connection by lan, so i think that i need use Serial port to recover it yes ? </p><p>But i don&#039;t realy understand how to do recover, could you explain me how to do it ? </p><p>Original documentation says: </p><p>You will need:</p><p>1. Serial cable with a 3.3v converter. Those nokia cables work well.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; Already bought</p><p>2. A terminal emulation. I used putty on windows, minicom on linux.</p><p>3. A TFTP server. I used tftp-hpa under linux.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;For what is thins TFTP server and can i do it on windows ? </p><p>4. A PC with a static IP address of 192.168.1.27 netmask 255.255.255.0. Please take note that I do not know if that address work on all routers. Mine is what it was looking for.</p><p>5. A network cable between the computer and the router (any) lan port.</p><p>How to recover:</p><p>1. Connect the serial cable.</p><p>2. Open a terminal with 115200 8n1.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; How to do it from putty ? ;S</p><p>3. Power on the router.</p><p>4. Wait for &quot;Autobooting in 1 seconds&quot;, then quickly type &quot;tpl&quot; (without the quotes) within the 1 second timeout. Power cycle if you miss it. You should be welcomed with &quot;ar7240&gt;&quot;. You are now talking to the bootloader. If nothing happend within a few seconds, check your connections.</p><p>5. Erase the flash: erase 0x9f020000 +7c0000</p><p>6. Transfert the firmware to ram, use the squashfs factory one: tftpboot 0x81000000 code.bin. If it timeout, verify which address the router want to fetch the file from. Mine wanted from 192.168.1.27 and I do not know if this is universal or &quot;random&quot;.</p><p>7. Copy from ram to flash: cp.b 0x81000000 0x9f020000 0x7c0000</p><p>8. Boot the new firmware: bootm 0x9f020000</p><p>A note on the address:</p><p>1. 0x81000000 is the default memory address that tftpboot wanted to use.</p><p>2. 0x9f020000 is the flash base address. Obtained from the serial console log when it tried to boot from the line: &quot;## Booting image at 9f020000 â€¦&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; is this contsant r i have to check it ? </p><p>3. 0x7c0000 is the firmware size.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt; how can i check my firmware size ? </p><br /><br /><p>I know about scripting and other stuff in windows, and a little bit on linux but i can&#039;t figure it out i will be appreciate for fast respond.</p>									</div>
