					<p>UPDATE ...</p><p>I finally got the cdr-csv to be written ... (at last ...)</p><p>The problem is very simple but still not documented ..</p><p>What solved the problem is uncommenting the following 2 lines in cdr.conf<br />(and changing to &#039;no&#039; since i did not want to use GMT)</p><p>[csv]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />usegmtime=no ;log date/time in GMT</p><p>I saw Hans that you had done it but since i didn&#039;t want to use GMT time ... i did not change this<br />(but did not expect it was a must for the Master.csv to be written)</p><br /><p>The [cdr] section seems to be new in v1.4 BUT it is also commented in the <br />default cdr.conf file AND the Master.csv will no be written without&nbsp; the [cdr] section <br />and at least 1 param ...
