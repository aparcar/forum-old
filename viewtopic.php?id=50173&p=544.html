					<p>The same applies for OpenWRT, I want to try out that software too, but I only see the download link for 15.05.1 Chaos Calmer for version 1 only, not version 2. I suppose since it&#039;s very little difference (at least according to Linksys) between V1 and V2 that I could possibly still install Chaos Calmer on my router (V2) but still, I&#039;m trying to make sure, I don&#039;t want a bricked device.</p><p>*The &quot;differences&quot; being firmware versions, I think this doesn&#039;t matter since I&#039;ll be flashing something else anyways.</p>									</div>

					<p>@InkblotAdmirer<br />I guess I should have phrased the comment differently.<br />Speed and more so stability are fine no complaints there and I have not had any in quite some time.<br />What bothers me is when under a high wlan load the average physical rate drops from a solid 866.5Mbps<br />to 400Mbps or less in one direction only. Tested on different laptops with different nic&#039;s with the same results.<br />I only use 5Ghz here unless someone needs a 2.4Ghz connection then I will fire that up.<br />I still think there is more to be done with the mwlwifi driver and I agree about the other influences.<br />There are no 5Ghz AP&#039;s in range here, yet there are times I will see signal quality fluctuate as does the physical rate under no load with no change in position. The closest house is at least 50 meters away.<br />It may be external influences but since I am not buying a real spectrum analyzer I won&#039;t know for sure.<br />The main reason for the comment are the issues some others are having with the radar detection that still needs addressed.</p>									</div>

					<p>@JW0914 great comprehensive description of your setup. I have few questions:<br />1. UTM can not be VPN or NAS server.Then you have this :&quot;A major benefit is VPN speed, with a massive performance....&quot; <br />2. can you elaborate more about &quot; 5 different VPN types (including HTML5)&quot; UTM feature<br />3, UTM is the first thing after your ISP as WAN connection/NAT/FW and other UTM specific features)? Then goes ACS? for what, what do you still miss on UTM beside VPN and NAS? if you need wifi you can put some PCI wifi card into server board and use openwrt for x86(if you want openwrt for your routing)<br />4. please answer is it possible the following setup: two VM machines on mini-ITX board, one is S UTM connected directly on WAN port,S UTM do his own job(web filtering, etc..)&nbsp; then fort forwarding from UTM firewall to the next VM with Openwrt(x86) where you put VPN and NAS server:-) It is AllinOne solution.<br />5. is there mini-itx board with SFP slot ? to eliminate ONT?</p><br /><br /><p>Regards,<br />Goran.</p>									</div>
