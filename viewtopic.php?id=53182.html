					<p>Hi<br />As part of and R&amp;D project (based on OpenWRT) I&#039;m designing a one-off daughter board for Alix 6.x and (probably will fit) 2.x boards.&nbsp; So far board has on it:</p><p>1. Power conditioning - Allows Alix to take 7vdc -&gt;48vdc&nbsp; (requires bodging a couple of additional wires to the logic board)<br />2. Keep Alive Power Ride-Through Circuit (Super cap based) Can allow for nice shutdown in case of power failure<br />3. ADC &amp; I2C I/O GPIO Expansion - 4 channel 12-bit ADC and 16 GPIO lines plus analog input<br />4. I2C Bus Passthrough with voltage level conversion option<br />5. Current use / voltage monitoring (requires bodging a couple of additional wires to the logic board)<br />6. 4 channel thermistor inputs<br />7. eeprom w. unique ID (addressable on I2C bus)<br />8. Possible (I can (almost) make it fit) internal USB2 connector</p><p>Do a lot of you use Alix boards for OpenWRT?&nbsp; This would make a pretty awesome addition to a home firewall.&nbsp; e.g. want to have it turn on lights, open garage doors, sense temperature. If anyone would find this board useful I could do a batch, start a project, blah blah etc etc.&nbsp; Any other suggested features?&nbsp; Note there really isn&#039;t a lot of room in my PCB design, which sits on the 3 rows of connectors on the board. I&#039;m also designing it so that the assembly still fits into the case with one additional ribbon/breakout protruding.</p>									</div>
