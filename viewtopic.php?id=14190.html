					<p>Can someone explain how Kamikaze works, the documentation is just appalling on the subject.</p><p>E.g. how are routes handled? The default configuration is expecting a DHCP server to supply a IP address at the WAN port, but where does it say that in the configuration?</p><p>moreover there a two vlan configurations but little information on how they are connected. Also, when does traffic enter the CPU or does it always? What are the performance implications of routing/switching.</p><p>I&#039;m getting tiered of trying to reverse engineer the how things work off completely undocumented configuration files.</p>									</div>

					<p>The Wiki is crap, have you read it? I have a million times, it&#039;s good at somethings, but right now, it&#039;s no good at all.</p><p>for instance where do you find info on this configuration?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan

Also what other valid options there are for &quot;proto&quot; and what do they mean?</p><p>I want to bypass as much of the router as possible, and just make it to a switch, which wireless computers can connect to as well. I however still want the router to grab it&#039;s own IP of an DHCP server which will be connected to the switch. If that&#039;s even possible. I&#039;m sure it is, but how? heck, the documentation does not say. I don&#039;t feel for trail and error either.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought so. Thanks for all the great info, I couldn&#039;t find it on the wiki if it was there (as you say it is). Excellent clarification.</p><p>Last thing, in the above config, how would I connect to my device? If the NAT stuff no longer occur will the device try to get it&#039;s IP of the switch as well? this &quot;option dhcp&quot; for lan, does it mean that it should request it&#039;s IP from that interface or that it should serve IPs?</p>									</div>

					<p>NAT has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; You can set up an NAT box that gets both LAN and WAN IPs from different DHCP servers.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done that, before.</p><p>In this case, the computer that controls the switch will get an IP address from a DHCP server on any switch port, or probably even the wireless interface.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/NetworkInterfaces">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/NetworkInterfaces</a> is a good read.&nbsp; Once you know how the interfaces are set up, you should know how you need to set up the interfaces.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t, you&#039;re probably a little too novice for OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
