					<p>Hi there,</p><p>You may have better luck with the ath10k mailing list (<a href="http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/ath10k">http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/ath10k</a>) or even looking at the wiki page for it (<a href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/ath10k">https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/use â€¦ ers/ath10k</a>). </p><p>However, I&#039;m curious what you&#039;re trying to do. I&#039;m working with a device with ath10k on it, and all I&#039;ve done is copy the latest firmware from the ath10k git repo to get some extra features (like 802.11s mesh support). What are you looking for? Have you compiled OpenWRT from scratch before? With some more information I might be able to help, but no guarantees.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello zsherin,</p><p>Thank you for reply. I would like to use latest ath10k driver for my clearfog board. I use OpenWRT trunk with compat-20160110. The driver is backported from 4.4 RC. Recently there are some new patches for ath10k driver. I would like to have a try and look forward for higher throughput.</p><p>The problem here is how to update or generate a new compat-wireless package which includes latest code from ath10k. The backports-output is easy to generate, but compiling them in OpenWRT build tree is hard for me.</p><p>Do you have any suggestion.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmm. I&#039;m sorry to say I haven&#039;t done that before. A completely blind guess would be to look at the source of the normal compat-wireless package, download it to your local tree, and substitute the output of your home-compiled compat-wireless. I have no idea what the output of your backports compilation looks like as I&#039;ve never done it before.</p><p>Looking at the ath10k mailing list digest for the past few days, there are other people doing what you&#039;re talking about with OpenWRT. I would strongly suggest again that you ask there as it seems I don&#039;t have the knowledge to help you. Best of luck!</p>									</div>
