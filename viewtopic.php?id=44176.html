					<p>Hi.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to figure out how PEAP+MSCHAPV2 works so I can setup a Free Radius server properly.<br />So I need your knowledge. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>As I have understood (and correct me if I&#039;m wrong), an authentication tunnel is created for the clients and inside the tunnel a second authentication occurs. OK, fine by there.</p><p>What I don&#039;t understand is how the windows clients can verify the server&#039;s identity by validating the certificate.</p><p>Because at the moment, if I don&#039;t <strong>un</strong>check the relative selection box in my windows clients (see picture below), authentication can&#039;t be done.</p><p><a href="http://oi43.tinypic.com/21qzw3.jpg">http://oi43.tinypic.com/21qzw3.jpg</a></p><p>What should I do in order to achieve that?<br />Do I have to create server certificates in a certain way, for example?<br />And if yes, how do I import them into windows?</p><p>I know it&#039;s more of a &quot;win32&quot; question, but I suppose someone experienced in linux networking would have an answer...</p>									</div>

Those are a (1) Certificate Authority, (2.1) A Public key, aka. Server Certificate with the CA in (1) as the signer, and (2.2) The private key corresponding to the certificate in (2.1)<br />- Freeradius will need all 3<br />- Your Win Clients will need the CA (1) installed in the windows certificate store (search online how to do this), or you can deploy it automatically to all win clients via active directory. By installing this CA into the certificate store, the win machines will &#039;trust&#039; server certificates signed by this CA</p><p>When connecting, the clients will setup a TLS session with the server and if the server key signing authority (1) is &#039;trusted&#039;, will connect ok.<br />Pay close attention to the server DNS name and the certificate CN - they must match, or put alternatives in the Alt Subject names field when creating your keys.<br />Have a look at <a href="http://xca.sourceforge.net/">xca on sourceforge</a> to manage your keys, but you will need to build from source.</p>									</div>
