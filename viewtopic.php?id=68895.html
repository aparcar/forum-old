					<p>Hey all, my issues started last night when my wifi quit working. I couldn&#039;t figure out why, so I decided to just restore to the original firmware. I grabbed the firmware from friedzombie and uploaded it via the Luci webgui. It looked like everything worked until I tried to access the router via 192.168.0.1. No luck.</p><p>I then went into recovery mode via TFPD using the same .bin file from friedzombie. No luck. Tried using a fresh one from TPlinks website. No luck. Tried using another one. No luck.</p><p>Both the friedzombie and the other one I found will allow the router to get to where it is flashing the Ethernet Port 1 and the power, but I can&#039;t access it from any address.</p><p>What can I do to fix it?</p>									</div>
