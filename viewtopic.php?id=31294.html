By default, leech won&#039;t download files older than 1 day, this can be adjusted in $CONFIG_DIR/default. This value is also used to clear downloads database (downloads older than that period will be removed from DB).</p><p>If you&#039;re interested, please also take a look into known issues and troubleshooting sections: <br />* <a href="https://github.com/alekseyt/leech#known-issues">https://github.com/alekseyt/leech#known-issues</a><br />* <a href="https://github.com/alekseyt/leech#troubleshooting">https://github.com/alekseyt/leech#troubleshooting</a></p>									</div>

					<p>leech 0.5 is out: <a href="https://github.com/alekseyt/leech/downloads">https://github.com/alekseyt/leech/downloads</a></p><p>It now uses cURL instead of wget, mainly because OpenWRT doesn&#039;t supply fully functional wget by default. Since wget is essential for OpenWRT normal work, you might break your box during wget upgrade if you&#039;re doing it wrong. Both transmission and rtorrent are dependent on libcurl already, so leech dependencies should be partially present already.</p><p>This is actually transitional release and 0.6 is coming soon (not soon as in &quot;very soon&quot;) to address the problem that inotify is broken in backfire 2.6 (or is it broken just for me?) and transmission&#039;s directory watching doesn&#039;t work there. Most likely leech will have a download hook, as someone suggested iirc, and will just run `transmission-remote -a` for an URL.</p><p>If you have any ideas or suggestions, i would be glad to hear from you by email: aleksey.tulinov@gmail.com</p>									</div>

					<p>@written_direcon</p><p>I&#039;m not familiar with development for UCI (only using it as a part of OpenWRT). I&#039;ll take a look, but no promises, definitely not before leech 1.0. While configuration compatibility is a goal for 0.1-1.0, something might change.</p><p>What benefits do you see in UCI? leech is designed to have as minimum configuration required as possible, all defaults should be fine for most of the people. All those values in `default` are only fallback if something went wrong, so you might tweak leech if you really need to. The only part that need real configuration is a list of RSS feeds (straightforward) and matching rules (not so straightforward). I&#039;m working on the later as well, i don&#039;t really like all the .* and \[ in configuration, it would be more convenient to have wildcards (*, ?, etc) instead of regular expressions. That&#039;s not really hard to implement, but this is at the end of the roadmap, .* is not so hard to type after all.</p>									</div>

					<p>@aleksey_t</p><p>I&#039;m now running DD-WRT since I had some stability problems with Open-WRT.<br />And I want to skip my python script for your Leech.</p><p>The problem I have is that I can&#039;t get it to work.<br />First I had to run the Leech command as root from cron, then it couldn&#039;t find Curl so I added a path.<br />But then I just get &quot;curl: can&#039;t load library &#039;libcurl.so.4&#039;&quot;.</p><p>I have tried adding all kind of path variables to the leech file but with no success.</p><p>So if you know what could go wrong and how to fix it I would be VERY grateful, since now I have to run it manually every day.</p><p>Thanks for a great script!</p><p>EDIT:</p><p>I can now answer it on own.<br />After A LOT of testing I have found a solution. I&#039;m running a rss.sh script from cron that contain the following:</p><p>#!/bin/sh<br />exec /bin/sh --login -c &#039;<br />source /mnt/sda_part1/root/.profile<br />CONFIG_DIR=&quot;/opt/etc/leech&quot; PERSISTENCE=&quot;/mnt/sda_part1/torrents/rss&quot; DOWNLOADS_DIR=&quot;/mnt/sda_part1/Stuff/Rss&quot; /opt/usr/sbin/leech &gt;/tmp/leech.log 2&gt;&amp;1&#039;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Khenke</strong> on 9 May 2013, 20:47)</p>

					<p>@Khenke</p><p>Frankly, i can&#039;t probably answer that question without looking at your setup. But it looks to me that your cron is running in limited environment, but i never haven&#039;t experienced this on OpenWRT with `crontab -e`.</p><p>Have you installed leech from .ipk file or manually? What cron file you&#039;re editing?</p><p>You could try to look at this Stackoverflow question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2388087/how-to-get-cron-to-call-in-the-correct-paths">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2388 … rect-paths</a></p>									</div>

					<p>leech 0.11 is out: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/alekseyt/leech/downloads">https://bitbucket.org/alekseyt/leech/downloads</a></p><p>This release as well as adding features and fixing bugs, also remove some features. So if you want to upgrade, please pay attention to changelog:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>0.11

[+] leech will only handle simple comment lines starting with #
    all other lines are not considered to be comments
[+] removed TMP option from config (default:TMP=)
[+] reverse matching support (default:REVERSE_DOWNLOADS=)

[*] lunch download will follow redirects
[*] temporary files will be created with $(mktemp -t)
[*] redone leech-wild-magic
[*] some other under the hood changes</code></pre></div><p>Reverse-matching introduced in this release is somewhat covered here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/alekseyt/leech#markdown-header-reverse-matching-filters.">https://bitbucket.org/alekseyt/leech#ma … g-filters.</a> You can also refer to /etc/leech/reverse-downloads. It is basically the same as /etc/leech/downloads, but used to exclude files from downloads.</p>									</div>
