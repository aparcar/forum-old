					<p>I have an IXP422 based board in which I run a custom-made linux version. During boot-up, I see</p><p>&nbsp; ixp400_eth: Initializing IXP400 NPE Ethernet driver software v. 1.5.1 <br />&nbsp; ixp400_eth: CPU clock speed (approx) = 266 MHz<br />&nbsp; [error] ixEthMiiPhyScan : unexpected Mii PHY ID 00221619<br />&nbsp; ixp400_eth: Found PHY 0 at address 1<br />&nbsp; ixp400_eth: ixp0 is using NPEB and the PHY at address 1<br />&nbsp; Obtained ETHA mac address 0:1b:8e:0:1:ba</p><p>Now I try to install OpenWrt on the board. It works except the ethernet port doesn&#039;t work, and I do not see anything like the above. It makes me believe the drivers are not compiled. I ran &quot;make menuconfig&quot; and selected Target System Intel XScale IXP4xx [2.6]. Then I ran &quot;make kernel_menuconfig&quot; and selected Arm system type IXP4xx-based as well as Intel IXP4xx Implemenation Options IXDPG425. I also check Network Device Support/Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit) -&gt; IXP4xx Ethernet support.</p><p>During compilation (make V=99) the only spurious thing I can see is </p><p>&nbsp; WARNING: kmod-ixp4xx-npe is not available in the kernel config</p><p>The kernel source directory does not contain any ixp400_eth.c file or similar, how come?</p><p>Another way to phrase my question is, how can I configure the build system to compile lan port drivers? </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Best Regards,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danieljanzon</strong> on 12 Feb 2008, 19:19)</p>

					<p>Now the module is built, and I have the file</p><p>.../kamikaze/build_dir/linux-ixp4xx_generic/linux-2.6.23.14/drivers/net/arm/ixp4xx_eth.ko</p><p>But it does not end up in the squashfs file system under /lib/modules. Is that a bug? I guess it should be copied to the target image but isn&#039;t, for some reason.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Daniel,</p><p>How were you able to build ixp4xx_eth.ko?&nbsp; I did everything you did in the first post but I still don&#039;t see ixp4xx_eth.ko.&nbsp; I&#039;m using an ixp4xx board and my ethernet currently runs at 10Mbps half-duplex.&nbsp; I would like to run it at 100Mbps full-duplex if someone can help me:)</p><p>Shane</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I don&#039;t quite remember. What do you mean by &quot;don&#039;t see ixp4xx_eth.ko&quot;? Do you among the files on the board or in the source tree in your development environment? For me, it wasn&#039;t copied to the image and thus never ended up on the board (I had to move it there manually). Do you mean the &#039;find .../kamikaze/build_dir/linux-ixp4xx_generic/linux-2.6.x.y -name ixp4xx_eth.ko&#039; produces no output?</p><p>What files do you have in linux-2.6.x.y/drivers/net/arm/ ?</p><p>And also, do you have any specific reason not to use the Intel Access Library available free of charge (but maybe not without registration) from Intel.com? It&#039;s source code, and needs less tuning than the OpenWrt drivers need, I believe.</p>									</div>
