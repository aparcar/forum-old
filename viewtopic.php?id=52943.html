					<p>I would like to provide an ipv6 address to ipv4 only server. The server is in the LAN(&amp; has private ip address), so the the ipv6 address need not be global. My plan is to connect the server to a openwrt router with Tayga(NAT64) installed and use Tayga&#039;s one to one mapping to provide ipv6 address to my ipv4 only server. The problem is that I cant seem to find instructions on how to configure Tayga for one to one mapping in openwrt. But firstly, can I do what I described above using Tayga?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
