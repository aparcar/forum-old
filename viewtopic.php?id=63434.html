					<p>Hello everyone, </p><p>How to use mwan3 as a failover? I&#039;ve tried, with no results. It is working perfectly as load balance.</p><p>Another issue is: how to have ddns package uptade accordingly? with load balance, it keeps changing ddns ip all the time and this is service abuse.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>david.lynch</strong> on 17 Mar 2016, 04:26)</p>

					<p>Hi, I am using mwan3 for failover only and it works fine for me.</p><p>You have changed the default rule to use the &quot;wan_wan2&quot; policy instead of the default &quot;balanced&quot; policy, like:</p><p>config rule &#039;default_rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;0.0.0.0/0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option use_policy &#039;wan_wan2&#039;</p><p>And you have a wan_wan2 policy that has your first WAN interface &quot;wan&quot; with a lower metric (e.g. metric 1) than wan2, like:</p><p>config policy &#039;wan_wan2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list use_member &#039;wan_m1_w3&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list use_member &#039;wan2_m2_w2&#039;</p><p>...then all traffic from client PCs should only go out the wan interface as long as mwan3 detects wan is up based on its ping tests. Are you seeing traffic balance on both wan interfaces when testing from client PCs connected to the router?</p><p>For ddns-scripts in cases where I am using failover only, I have not tried updating the DDNS entry from the router itself. I just use a ddns client on an inside device and the update automatically reflects the failover and failback actions of mwan3. But if you wanted to do this from the router, note that that traffic originating from the router (not coming from inside PCs) itself is handled differently -- see the &quot;The routable loopback (self)&quot; section of the wiki page. You would likely want to use the web update method as well for ddns. But I have not personally tried this.</p><p>Regards,<br />Tim</p>									</div>
