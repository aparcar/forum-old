(not &quot;keep it pressed&quot;, but actually press it). The timing of when to press the button during the boot process, depends on the router...<br />Read: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd#specific.configuration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … figuration</a></p><p>And when you are talking about DHCP, what are you talking about? You disbaled the router getting its WAN IP from ISP with DHCP, or you changed router to get LAN IP from non-existing other DHCP server, or you disabled DHCP for LAN?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Aug 2013, 14:02)</p>

					<p>Not sure what I did wrong last time but today I fixed it with this:</p><p>Failsafe mode</p><p>Warning!WARNING: You may be unable to access even if you see fancy fast flashing of &quot;SYS&quot; LED due to a bug #6922</p><p>- Unplug the router&#039;s power cord<br />- Connect any router LAN port directly to your PC<br />- Configure your PC with a static IP address: 192.168.1.2<br />- Plug the power on to the router<br />- Wait until the &quot;SYS&quot; LED starts flashing repeatedly<br />- Press the &quot;QSS&quot; button (on the front of the router) – the &quot;SYS&quot; LED will now start flashing at a faster rate<br />- Login to the router by using telnet to connect to the IP address 192.168.1.1 – there will be an immediate unauthenticated login to a root shell</p><p>Thanks for your help guys!</p>									</div>
