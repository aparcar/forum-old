					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I want to share my work here, in case anyone has any feedback, has done this before, or might look into doing it in the future.</p><p>I am using OpenWRT r45574 on TP-Link TL-WR710N hardware, and need to write a custom /etc/rc.button/reset script to allow for the rollback of configuration changes to a previous, safe, state.</p><p>I use these small devices as inexpensive networked serial/RS232 probes.&nbsp; A USB-to-serial adapter is plugged into the USB and either the 802.11 wireless radio or the built-in ethernet interface is used to connect to the local network.</p><p>I mail these devices out to remote sites in far-away places and usually never see them again.</p><p>By default, I leave the network interfaces configured as DHCP clients, but sometimes I need to do crazy stuff like set a static IP, route between interfaces, or VPN/NAT between interfaces.</p><p>When I make such changes and then reboot to apply them, there is a chance that I will permanently lose access to the device if mistakes are made.</p><p>A solution to mitigate this risk is to make the reset button restore a previously saved configuration state, which will allow the client to be accessed once again.</p><p>I imagine that I would write a script, like &quot;saveconfig&quot; or &quot;savesafe&quot;, which would then tar up /etc and other critical files to some location on the local flash. Then, when the reset button is pressed for less than 2 seconds, the reset-button script would restore this safe configuration and reboot the device. Theoretically, I could then regain control of the device since the old config was known to be working.</p><p>I can&#039;t use the default reset behavior, because that totally wipes the overlay flash via a jffs2reset. I would lose required local customization which would break the device.</p><p>So, I need a custom solution.</p><p>Has anyone done this before, and do you have any feedback?</p><p>I will be working on this today and will post a script or whatever I figure out once I do it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I started thinking about how I would back up files and restore them.</p><p>What tool would I use? tar? What files do I need to backup and restore? Where would I get my list of files?</p><p>Fortunately, I realized that most of the work has already been done. The &quot;sysupgrade&quot; script already does this! I can use the /etc/sysupgrade.conf file as a list of the files I want to back up, and sysupgrade already has options to backup and restore a file.</p>									</div>

It is possible to install packages or files in the right place and break networking or booting on the system. The sysupgrade config backup system already does exactly what I want, so I am using sysupgrade -b to create the backup file.</p><p>The problem I am having right now is wiping the overlay prior to restoration. Obviously we can&#039;t just do that because critical files are on the overlay, and doing an rm -rf breaks the system. This is why sysupgrade calls a bunch of functions in the /lib/upgrade/ directory which handles creating a temporary ramfs and doing a pivot-root onto it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Pretty nice.<br />I haven&#039;t needed exactly this functionality, but nice work in any case.</p><p>One idea for further development:<br />I save my &quot;good config&quot; in a tar.gz file in my firmware binary as a custom file (&lt;buildroot&gt;/files/... ). I also include the scripts to unpack that archive. This makes good settings available even after a firstboot cleanup as long as I can reach the console. I can unpack good settings with one simple command. (I publish my firmware as a community firmware, so I include the settings in encrypted format. See <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=142896#p142896">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 96#p142896</a> ). The unpacking might even be automated via uci-defaults files.</p><p>uci-defaults might be interesting also for you. They are normally located in /etc/uci-defaults directory, but they get deleted after being run successfully, so normally the directory seems empty after a boot. The scripts gets deleted if it exits with code 0. If it exits with 1 (or something else), the script remains there for the next boot.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci#defaults">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci#defaults</a></p><p>That provides the possibility to have something run automatically once after new flash or after firstboot cleanup. In a live router you can see the existing uci-defaults scripts in /rom/etc/uci-defaults, as /etc/uci-defaults is typically empty (after all scripts have been run ok).</p><p>uci-defaults might offer you a way to include several &quot;good settings&quot; in the firmware and after firstboot get one of the archives expanded based on the MAC address or something. (Two years ago I sniffed router MAC and set a few settings based on that. Check the end of <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=185418#p185418">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 18#p185418</a> )</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 3 May 2015, 10:40)</p>
