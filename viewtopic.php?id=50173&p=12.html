					<p>So here is what I&#039;ve been seeing after running it solid for over a week.</p><p>The disconnects don&#039;t seem to be directly tied to running out of memory-- I&#039;ve been running with with tweaked memory settings and swap and they are still occurring.</p><p>I do see a lot of cpu stalls-- ALL of them showing stack traces related to network ops-- often Sys_sendto but not always.</p><p>I&#039;ve also seen several kernel panics-- hadn&#039;t turned on minicom logging and so have missed the full details before it would reboot itself.</p><p>The migration/0 process is consuming a massive amount of CPU time-- migration/1 almost nothing.</p><p>At times the route&#039;s load will jump to 4-5 when nothing seems to be going on-- feels like it&#039;s due to the migration/0 process. This often happens around the time of disconnects-- certainly see cpu stalls during this time.</p><p>Several of my machines are using the WRT1900AC as their router-- caveat that any machine that needs a solid wifi is connecting to an Airport Express <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Other devices such as phones are using the WRT1900AC&#039;s wifi and rarely see issues... but they are likely 1) always re-connecting and 2) not moving huge amounts of data.</p>									</div>
