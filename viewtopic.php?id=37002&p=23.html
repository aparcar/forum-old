					<p>This device seems to be identical to the MiFi F1 which&nbsp; has a wiki page <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doku.php">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doku.php</a></p><p>An MPR-A1 trunk build as of Nov 23, 2013 (r38896) when flashed to the device did detect 32 MB of RAM. However the ethernet port was mapped to WAN and it was set up to get an address for a DHCP server. So to access the device connect the ethernet to the LAN port of another router and access through that. Once you get to the device - you can modify /etc/config/network to map all the enabled ports (0,1,2,3,4) to LAN. As it turns out port 4 is the port for the physical Ethernet and so that needs to be part of the LAN VLAN. To do a permanent fix - edit target/linux/ramips/base-files/etc/uci-defaults/02_network by inserting comments as follows and then rebuild. This ensures that all the ports in the VLAN get assigned to the LAN.</p><p>#&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; if [ `swconfig dev rt305x port $port get lan` = &quot;0&quot; ]; then <br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; wanports=&quot;$port $wanports&quot; <br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; else <br />lanports=&quot;$port $lanports&quot; <br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; fi </p><p>To be safe first flash the initramfs image (as per the MPR-A2 wiki page) and then the sysupgrade image which is built from trunk.

					<p>Thanks @pratanczuk, nice tutorial and welcome on board!</p><p>However, I would suggest that you move this stuff to the OpenWrt Wiki, so it will be better indexed by Google and will allow the community to modify it!</p><p>You can just create a new product page in the hardware list of supported device, taking an existing product as template, and move your contents almost verbatim.</p><p>Also, your statement that the stock U-Boot bootloader&#039;s Ethernet is broken is false: the Ralink-provided modified U-Boot does not contain a TFTP client like the standard one, but it does contain a TFTP server, so that you can push an image to flash, see:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-g32#flashing.via.tftp-client.push.only.for.rev.c1">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-g32 … for.rev.c1</a></p><p>My guess is that Ralink originally did that so you don&#039;t have to run a TFTP server on the host side and just need a TFTP client on the PC.</p><p>This doesn&#039;t mean that the stock U-Boot will take an OpenWRT image as-is, it looks like there is still some kind of restriction that I am trying to figure out (like the firmware name containing some kind of pattern), so it still may be required to replace this bootloader by a known-good one.</p><p>I would also be very careful regarding which image/bootloader to flash: I bought a few &quot;Mifi-F10&quot; router during December 15% off AliBaba bargain sale at $8.45/piece (now back at $10.25: <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Portable-2in1-150Mbps-Mobile-Hotspot-RJ45-AP-Wireless-USB-3G-Wifi-Router-For-iPhone-4G/1181800456.html),">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Por … 456.html),</a> and these ones feature 4 MB Flash and 32 MB SDRAM <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/cool.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cool" /> ... It is thus required to use the 32 MB versions of Jiapengli&#039;s U-Boot instead of the default 16 MB version.</p><p>And before anything, I would suggest to backup all MTD partitions to the USB mass storage using: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>for i in 1 2 3 4; do cp /dev/mtd${i}ro /media/sda1/mtd${i}.img; done</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>Hello.</p><p>I got the same mini WiFi 3G router with the one pratanczuk is using but with 32MB SDRAM. I managed to get OpenWRT trunk (MPR-A1 profile) running on it quite fine (note: needs a patch in ralink_soc_eth.c). The only problem I can&#039;t figure out is how to get the LEDs working. I can see them both light up when the router boots up but then the are turned off.</p><p>Any ideas about what I could try?</p>									</div>
