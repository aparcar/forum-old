					<p>Hi to all!! I&#039;m new here and I&#039;m starting hitting my head with some problems. I&#039;ve tried to describe it as simple as I can:</p><p>I&#039;ve installed Chaos Chalmer 15.05 in my TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND and then the OVS package with opkg. When I try to create the bridge on OVS I obtain the following message:</p><p>ovs-vsctl: unix:/var/run/db.sock: database connection failed (No such file or directory)</p><p>I &#039;ve looked for the file but it seems not to be there, so the bridge is never created.<br />Has someone experienced something similar before?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, fortunately I&#039;ve solved it going back the configuration to factory default, and then I installed the OVS package again. The problem was not the OVS itself, but it was the lack of space bacause of software I had installed additionally. Furthermore, I couldn&#039;t modified or remove any package because of the lack of space in memory.</p><p>Now I will go on with my testing!</p>									</div>
