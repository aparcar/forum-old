					<p>Hi all<br />I&#039;m using TP-Link WR841N as simple WiFi Access point + ethernet switch. Since I need all the 5 ethernet ports, I&#039;ve bridged WAN with LAN and WiFi in a single physical bridge in the firewall LAN zone.<br />Compared with the default &quot;out of the box&quot; setup, I&#039;ve just disabled all the protocol on the WAN, bridged WAN with LAN, and disabled DHCP server, since my primary router does the job.<br />I&#039;ve connected uplink (the ethernet link from the master router) to WAN, and connected some TVs to LAN ports and smartphones via WiFi.<br />The very strange issue is that my TVs can&#039;t find DLNA server running in the network (it&#039;s physically connected to the main router) but the smartphones, connected via WiFi to the same TP-Link can!!! And if I connect uplink to a LAN port instead of a WAN, the TVs can find the DLNA server!!!<br />It&#039;s like something blocks multicast (as far as I know DLNA use UDP multicast packets for discovery), but the interfaces (all of them) are bridged, so why (and why via WiFi works, via LAN not)?<br />Thanks for the support, bye!</p>									</div>
