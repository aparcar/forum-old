					<p>Hello there, </p><p>Because of incredible instability, I wanted to flash the router with OpenWRT&#039;s cousin, dd-wrt.</p><p>So to the software upgrade page I went, selected dd-wrt mini, unchecked &quot;Keep settings&quot; as I wanted to start clean, unplugged the modem and clicked on &quot;Flash&quot;. A few minutes I wait, the router is finally back online (no LED flashing), and as I want to access it, I end up on the exact same OpenWRT page I came from.</p><p>I tried the 30 / 30 / 30 hard reset, then flashing, and it failed. I tried to use the soft reset command in the interface, then flashing, it failed yet again.</p><p>Then I reproduced the exact same steps with Linksys&#039; stock firmware, and it failed again.</p><p>What kind of magic should I perform to erase OpenWRT and return to a stabler firmware?</p>									</div>

					<p>Find a suitable .trx image. If there is none grab a bin image and strip the first 32 bytes so that the remaing part starts with HDR0.<br />You can use the command &quot;dd if=firmware.bin of=firmware.trx bs=32 skip=1&quot; for that.</p><p>Afterwards transfer the image to /tmp on the router using scp and write it with &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/firmware.trx linux&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so an update here. The dd-wrt firmware, as OpenWRT and Linksys&#039; came as a .bin image. I created the equivalent .trx as your wrote, then uploaded it. Before upload to the router, I had to reset it twice because it crashed as soon as I opened the SCP connection, that failed using Fugu, but finally succeeded using the Terminal at the third trial, after two stalls.</p><p>Internet access screeched to a halt when the SSH connection was opened, then wifi crashed and router ceased to respond. As I had to reset it, I lost the content of the /tmp folder. Most of the time, it took upwards of 20 seconds just to get the password prompt from the router. When I finally was able to get to the /tmp folder and see its content, after 6 or 7 resets, I was greeted by a message saying format is not valid:</p><p># mtd -r write /tmp/dd-wrt.v24_mini_generic2.trx linux<br />Bad trx header<br />This is not the correct file format; refusing to flash.<br />Please specify the correct file or use -f to force.</p><p>So, what else now?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I flashed it the following way:<br />1. restart in failsafe mode<br />2. Erase rootfs_data, reboot<br />3. switch back to DHCP on the LAN, not fixed IP<br />4. Upload dd-wrt mini, don&#039;t keep settings.<br />5. Now, I can access telnet, I see a wireless AP names &quot;dd-wrt&quot; being up, but I can&#039;t access the Web interface. Browser states &quot;Can&#039;t open page&quot;.</p><p>As OpenWRT and dd-wrt are cousins, what should I do to have access to the web interface?</p>									</div>
