					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have successfully installed openwrt on the ps-1208 following the advice in this page, and with the help of Clem. Now, my question: is it possible to make hostapd log the authentication process for all the authentication attempts?

					<p>Hi clem,</p><p>it seems to me that no ntp client is in your package repository.

					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I am currently using the print server as wireless access point, and I am satisfied with that. Actually, I came into possession of the Print Server (PS) because it was sold together with my epson printer (<a href="http://www.epson.it/Store/Stampanti-e-multifunzione/Epson-Stylus-SX400-Wi-Fi-Edition">http://www.epson.it/Store/Stampanti-e-m … Fi-Edition</a>). Now, I would like to connect the printer to my network via the print server/access point. Of course, I could connect the printer to the PS, but I won&#039;t be able to use the PS as wireless access point. Since the printer has itself a USB port, I was wondering whether I could connect the printer to the PS, and the USB drive (with all the data) to the printer, and make the PS boot through the usb drive (the one I am already using) via the printer... I know it sounds complicated, but my PC (which is at present connected to&nbsp; printer) can boot a USB drive connected to the printer, so maybe I could do the same with the PS. Of course, I will have to install some printer driver as well, but I think that the hardest part is to make the PS boot via the printer. Any Idea? Suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zanny</strong> on 11 Dec 2010, 16:32)</p>

					<p>the best solution would be to use an usb HUB <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> then connect the usb key and the printer on it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> don&#039;t know if it will work perfectly but another guy was using the ps as a music server so with and additional usb sound-card.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>clem-vangelis</strong> on 16 Dec 2010, 15:53)</p>

					<p>Hi zanny,</p><p>I believe it&#039;s because openwrt code has been updated. however look by yourself to the file&nbsp; linux/brcm47xx/profiles/PS-1208MFG.mk. Compare it with the file profile.patch and you will see the differences. Profile file are just parameters to pre-configure package selection in make menuconfig. So you can also start with the default profile in menuconfig and deselect the unneeded packages.</p><p>for the second problems it&#039;s because &quot;patches&quot; means for each patch in the tar.gz <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>By the way if you don&#039;t need special packages just take the openwrt builds from my website, it&#039;ll be much simpler for you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>clem-vangelis</strong> on 25 Apr 2011, 17:06)</p>
