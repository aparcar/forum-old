					<p>Hello,<br />the last few days I have been playing around with my two WR703N routers. At some point I realized that the data transfer to the USB stick (extroot) was really slow (~500 kB/s) - compared to ~7MB/s before.</p><p>So I took my second router and started from scratch:<br />a) I flashed the OpenWRT squashfs-factory image, <br />b) setup the internet connection performed the extroot process (following <a href="http://en.code-bude.net/2013/02/16/how-to-increase-storage-on-tp-link-wr703n-with-extroot/">http://en.code-bude.net/2013/02/16/how- … h-extroot/</a> )</p><p>c) Then I installed the openssh-sftp-server package.</p><p>Download rates from the internet to my PC via the router work fine (&gt;3MB /s), but when moving files to / from the USB stick, I only get a transfer rate of ~50 kB/s, so even slower than before!<br />When downloading a file via wget to the router, I get the same slow download rate.</p><p>I exchanged the USB stick for a microSD card and tried the process again, but with the same result. Speedtest of the stick / µSD on the PC yield fast data rates.</p><p>Also, connecting the storage directly or with a USB hub in between did no change the transfer rate.</p><p>##Edit##<br />I got the same slow transfer rate, when logging in the router via SSH and copied files on the USB stick.<br />##</p><p>I am clueless!</p><p>Can anyone give any advice on where the error might be?<br />I preferred the 7MB/s read / write I had before...</p><p>Thank you in advance,<br />halfdome</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>halfdome</strong> on 16 Mar 2014, 19:52)</p>

					<p>Have you made any progress in tracking down the issue?</p><p>I might have a related problem here - using the WR703N to extend an existing network:</p><p>I use the internal wifi-hardware as in AP mode and have an USB-Wifi-Stick attached and <br />configured as a client (STA) for an AVM FritzBox 7390. Since this is a LAN,&nbsp; I just use plain <br />IP forwarding between both interfaces. (no nat, iptables, etc.) </p><p>The fritzbox and the wr703n are approx. 18m apart from each other, the fritzbox<br />mounted in an uninsulated attic and the tp-link behind a window at the same height. <br />So there is line of sight with just a roofing tile inbetween.</p><p>As long as there is only moderate traffic (surfing some websites) I experience <br />no problems. However, when I try to transfer larger files, I experience a big lag<br />on the client device/uplink. Ping latency increases from 2ms to over 2000ms and more<br />with the link speed going down from over 60something MBit/s to a max. of 6.5Mbit/s</p><p>btw: <br />top shows 0% io when transferring larger amounts of data between the networks.</p><br /><p>Signal level on the uplink is around 60dBm to 70dBm&nbsp; and of course the AP is at least<br />5 channels apart from the uplink-channel. </p><p>I already tried different USB-Wifi-Adapters (tp-link 722/ath9k_htc and logilink wl0084b/rt5370)<br />with the same result. So apparently it is not a matter of the wifi-driver-kernel-module.</p><p>On the other hand, when using just the internal device with AP and STA on the same channel, <br />I get slow but constant throughput with a latency on the uplink between 140ms and 800ms.</p><br /><p>My guess is, that there is some issue with the USB-support on this device! </p><p>Any idea, why the datarate drops so significantly when transfering larger files? </p><p>What do you people suggest??</p><br /><p>System is up to date! <br />(Linux OpenWrt 3.10.34 #1 Thu Apr 10 07:46:15 UTC 2014 mips GNU/Linux)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wr703n</strong> on 10 Apr 2014, 23:14)</p>
