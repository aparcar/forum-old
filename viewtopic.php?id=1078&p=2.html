					<p>Sadly I have to say that works the same way to me. I posted the results done at home with a very simple setup and didn&#039;t notice those problems. When I set the WRT54G in the WLAN (25 WRT54G behind this one) I had exactly the same problems. </p><p>It looks like this setup works fine if there&#039;s only 1 PC connected to the WRT54G&#039;s LAN ports. Right now I have one WRT54G configured in client-wet mode at home with 1 PC connected at it and it works right. If I connect another one problems come up.</p><p>Had no time to work on this because I have a much serious problem with a WRT54G in AP mode that crashes on heavy traffic transfers. Once I got this fixed I&#039;ll go again on the client-wet mode, I guess there&#039;s something to do with ARP, maybe have to tell WRT54G to modify the routing, to put there a static ARP routing or something like this. </p><p>I&#039;m&nbsp; considering to use some kind of tunneling between them, this way you can set as many NATs as you need in the WLAN and it would be transparent to them. Looked at OpenVPN but it takes too much WRT54G&#039;s CPU usage and you get less bandwith, need to find a tunneling without cypher cause I don&#039;t need that level of security, the underlying WEP is enough. Don&#039;t want to configure a VPN in each PC, WRT54G should manage the tunneling.</p><p>I know this is not easy to apply to a small WLAN and that would be more reliable to have an easy way to solve this.</p><p>Any expert can help us on this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, guys.</p><p>I&#039;d be surprised if there is a way to get true &quot;client-mode bridging&quot; to work without some kind of layer 3/proxy-ARP-esque solution.&nbsp; I believe that the problems that people are seeing with this method of wireless bridging has to do with a limitation in the 802.11 spec, and is not specifically a limitation of the WRT54G hardware or the OpenWRT software.&nbsp; Basically, as I understand it, an AP knows where to send a packet to by looking at the MAC addresses that clients used to identify themselves TO the AP when they registered/associated with it.&nbsp; So, if the wireless client identifies itself with its own MAC and then tries to &quot;bridge&quot; ethernet traffic over to the AP, the AP is going to be receiving ethernet frames which bear MAC addresses that are different from the one that the AP knows the wireless client by.&nbsp; If someone else connected to the AP tries to send traffic to one of the devices plugged into the &quot;client bridge&quot;, it will prepare an ethernet frame with the target MAC address being the device it wants to talk to, *not* the wireless client.&nbsp; Once that packet reaches the AP, it doesn&#039;t know what to do with it because there ARE no clients associated to it with that MAC address.&nbsp; The associated stations list *IS* the AP&#039;s learn table.&nbsp; In some cases/implementations, the AP may not even bother accepting packets from a wireless client to begin with if the MAC in the ethernet frames it is receiving from it does not match the MAC that the client used to identify itself by to the AP during association.</p><p>I work for a wireless ISP, and the equipment that we use to connect our clients to the APs on our towers have solved this dilemma in one of two ways, traditionally:</p><p>1) The wireless client &quot;clones&quot; the MAC of the first ethernet device it sees behind it, associates to the AP using that MAC, and then bridges traffic back-and-forth between the AP and that ethernet device ONLY.&nbsp; If it sees the MAC change on its ethernet interface (either because someone plugged in a different device or because there are multiple devices behind it), it will re-associate using the new MAC so that it can bridge traffic to THAT device.</p><p>2) The wireless client associates to the AP using its own MAC and then does what we like to call &quot;MAC-NAT&quot;: it maintains an internal layer 2 &quot;NAT&quot; table that maps this IP address to this MAC address, and then re-writes the ethernet frames as they&#039;re going out to the AP so that they all look like they&#039;re coming from the wireless device itself.&nbsp; When a packet comes in bound for a certain IP address, it consults its &quot;MAC-NAT learn table&quot; to detemine which host on the ethernet side of the bridge the packet should go to, and re-writes the packet accordingly before sending it on.</p><p>Neither of these are truly &quot;ethernet bridges.&quot;</p><p>From the sounds of it, the Linux bridge device coupled with the Broadcom wireless driver in client mode is doing something similar to #1 above; that&#039;s the only way I&#039;m able to explain why pings come back from all hosts, but only from one-at-a-time.&nbsp; It&#039;d be interesting to see what is going on during these &quot;ping tests&quot; from the AP&#039;s perspective: is the MAC of the WRT54G &quot;changing&quot; to match the MAC of the host that you are seeing ping responses from at that given instant?</p><p>I don&#039;t know too terribly much about WDS itself (it&#039;s something we&#039;ve never felt the urge to put into production anywhere on our network; our backhauls use more robust wireless solutions, and 802.11 is simply the &quot;last-mile&quot; hop to the customer), but I&#039;d guess that it was drafted up precisely because bridging devices behind an 802.11 client -- with the way the standard is written up -- simply doesn&#039;t work without some magic involved, and so another solution for effective &quot;wireless bridging&quot; was needed.&nbsp; Thus, if you want a REAL ethernet bridge over 802.11 links, you&#039;ll have to go with WDS.&nbsp; Otherwise, if you want multiple hosts behind the client bridge, you&#039;ll need to set up Proxy-ARP and use it as your &quot;MAC-NAT&quot; solution.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>-- Nathan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NathanA</strong> on 1 May 2005, 03:15)</p>

					<p>Ok I finally found a way to make it work. :-)</p><p>In my tests at home I have this layout:</p><p>Home network: 192.168.1.0/24</p><p>AP (Linksys DWL 900+): 192.168.1.10</p><p>[Wired to 192.168.1.10 (AP)]<br />DSL-router: 192.168.1.1<br />PC1 (Windows 98): 192.168.1.2<br />Server1 (Debian): 192.168.1.3<br />Server2 (Debian): 192.168.1.6</p><p>Wireless client in &quot;acidbits&#039; mode&quot; (WRT54G): 192.168.1.61 (eth1) &amp; 192.168.1.60 (vlan0)</p><p>[Wired to 192.168.1.60 (WRT54G LAN Ports)]<br />PC2 (WinXP): 192.168.1.33<br />Laptop (Ubuntu): 192.168.1.233</p><p>Here we go. What I did is to &quot;break the bridge&quot; and put each of the Interfaces in the same &quot;home subnet&quot;:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set lan_ifname=vlan0              #  &quot;vlan2&quot; on hardware version 1
nvram set wifi_ifname=eth1              #  &quot;eth2&quot; on hardware version 1
# Config ifaces
nvram set lan_proto=static 
nvram set lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.60
nvram set lan_netmask=255.255.255.0
nvram set lan_dns=80.58.0.33
nvram unset lan_gateway
nvram set wifi_proto=static
nvram set wifi_ipaddr=192.168.1.61
nvram set wifi_netmask=255.255.255.0
nvram unset wifi_gateway
# Client mode
nvram set wl0_mode=sta
# WiFi Settings
nvram set wl0_ssid=aCiDBiTS-home
nvram set wl0_wep=disabled</code></pre></div><p>Make sure your firewall doesn&#039;t makes any MASQUERADE, for testing purposes you can disable it. In /etc/init.d/ I set this script named S70routing:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

#Enable proxy_arp for each interface, so WRT54G eth1 and vlan0 allow packets 
#going to other IPs than themselves (192.168.1.60 &amp; 192.168.1.61)

echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/vlan0/proxy_arp
echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/proxy_arp

#Tell him in which Interface is the gateway:

route add default gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth1

#Teach WRT54G in which interface is placed each device in the network:

route add -host 192.168.1.1 dev eth1
route add -host 192.168.1.2 dev eth1
route add -host 192.168.1.3 dev eth1
route add -host 192.168.1.6 dev eth1
route add -host 192.168.1.10 dev eth1
route add -host 192.168.1.33 dev vlan0
route add -host 192.168.1.233 dev vlan0</code></pre></div><p>And that&#039;s it! Everything works as expected, all devices are in the same subnet. Problem is that each time you add a new device you have to add a new entry to the routing table to specify in wich interface it is. I love OpenWRT :-)</p><p>UPDATE: Broadcasts doesn&#039;t work, in windows you won&#039;t find the resources of your workgroup. But you can make &quot;hard links&quot; like: change your \\WorkGroup\printer1 by \\192.168.1.x\printer1</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>acidbits</strong> on 4 May 2005, 16:51)</p>

					<p>It might be possible with ebtables too, but I&#039;ve solved the issue as follows:</p><p>* split the br0 to vlan0 and eth1<br />* set 192.168.0.253/32 for vlan0 and 192.168.0.253/24 for eth1<br />* ip r add 192.168.0.25/32 dev vlan0 (thats the only box behind the wrt, add host routes / network routes as you need)<br />* echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/proxy_arp<br />* echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/vlan0/proxy_arp</p><p>This made the WRT a semi-bridge between 192.168.0.25 on the LAN port and 192.168.0.* on the WLAN, which now works reliably for me.</p><p>The only thing you can&#039;t do is to move machines from one side to the other without changing the routes on the WRT</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all!</p><p>&quot;Complete routing&quot; is not an option for me!</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to do a &quot;MAC-NAT&quot; with ebtables with no success! :-(</p><p>Now, i found something new :-) ... please take a look at: <br /><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/parprouted/?topic_id=150">http://freshmeat.net/projects/parprouted/?topic_id=150</a></p><p>It&#039;s a daemon called parprouted ... and here is the description out of the man-page:</p><p>parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy ARP bridging.&nbsp; Unlike standard bridging, proxy ARP bridging allows to bridge Ethernet networks behind wireless nodes. Normal L2 bridging does not work between wireless nodes because wireless does not know about MAC addresses used in the wired Ethernet networks. Also this daemon is useful for making transparent firewalls. The daemon listens for incoming ARP requests, and in case the location of the requested IP address is unknown, forwards them to other interfaces, as well as updates kernel ARP table with the received replies. When necessary, the daemon generates an ARP reply itself, which causes the stations to send traffic to the host daemon is running on. By automatically adding appropriate /32 routes to Linux kernel IP routing table for the hosts learned via ARP, daemon ensures that the Linux kernel will be able to route the packets to the destination host when it receives them with-out any need routing/subnetting manually. All routes entered by the daemon have a metric of 50.<br />Unless you use -p switch, all entries in the ARP table will be refreshed (rechecked by sending ARP requests) every 50 seconds. This keeps them from being expired by kernel. Normally it takes about 60 ms for a bridge to update all its tables and start sending packets to the destination.</p><p>Ahhhmmm ... am I completely wrong or isn&#039;t that exactly what we need?!? ( ... looks like that there is no precompiled openwrt-package available for this ...)</p><p>By the way ... I&#039;ve red somewhere in the sveasoft-forum that the upcoming release will support multi-clients!?!</p><p>greetz<br />-=kao=-</p><p>*Edit* I&#039;ve already compiled it for openwrt ... will post my results tomorrow!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaobiore</strong> on 23 May 2005, 23:14)</p>

					<p>Hello all. I want to set up my WRT54G to function purely as a bridge so that I may hook two LAN&#039;s in my office together and make them function as one.

Both of the Linksys WRT54G are receiving internet access from the same source, but I cannot get the LAN behind one linksys to reach the other LAN behind the second linksys and function as one.<br />Anyone know how I may do this.?<br />I thought disabling DHCP totally might help, but I haven&#039;t been able to get that done either.

					<p>Does anyone know how to disable DHCP on the Linksys WRT54G running Openwrt firmware?</p><p>I was able to get a web interface running on it from <a href="http://davidoffdotnet.net/openwrt/ipkg/interface-wrt_0.72_mipsel.ipk">http://davidoffdotnet.net/openwrt/ipkg/ … mipsel.ipk</a> From this interface, I disabled DHCP, but found that the linksys was still assigning IP addresses to any station connected to it via cable or wireless cards. I would like to assign an IP to the linksys and stop it from assigning IP&#039;s to the clients so I may setup a seperate DHCP server on my LAN. Is this possible?</p><p>Also, anyone have an idea where or how I could get another web interface (perhaps another may have more features)?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Patrix</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I configured my Linksys WRT54G according to the guidelines at <a href="http://woz.gs/wifi/openwrtbridge.html">http://woz.gs/wifi/openwrtbridge.html</a> after this. I was able to get the linksys to perform the way I want, but only in failsafe mode. When I boot to failsafe mode, the linksys becomes transparent like any ordinary switch and allows my workstations connected to it to receive IP addresses from any DHCP server on my LAN (the linksys is also connected via the WAN port to my LAN) instead of assigning any IP&#039;s. This is the result I want, but it only happens in failsafe mode.</p><p>Can anyone tell me why this happens, and how I can achieve the same result in normal mode?</p><p>Thanks<br />Patrix</p>									</div>
