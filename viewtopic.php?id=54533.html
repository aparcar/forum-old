					<p>I&#039;d like to monitor the dns requests my wireless devices are making via the router to see if they are doing unauthorized &quot;phone home&quot; calls to manufacturers or apps that I am not aware of, or more mildly if there is not enough cache time on requests and I should artificially cache the result longer.</p><p>What is the easiest/best way to collect this data?</p><p>Does anything as simple as vnstat exist for dns logging?</p>									</div>

					<p>How about a simple iptables rule that picks the DNS queries, excludes those originating from the desktop PC and adds a line to the system log?<br />That might work in a home environment with just a few devices.</p><p>The default dhcp server dnsmasq also offers the option to log dns queries with &quot;logqueries&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 11 Dec 2014, 11:01)</p>
