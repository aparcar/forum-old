					<p>The SD card mod Rasmus and Mads is VERY neat indeed!&nbsp; Is it true that the SD mod takes up a lot of processing power?&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind a little speed lost if I can add more storage into my WRT54G.&nbsp; However, I only happen to have a couple of CompactFlash cards lying around.&nbsp; Do you think a CompactFlash mod will ever exist?&nbsp; I can donate a card if that helps!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not an expert on flash media, but from what I understand, the interface for Comact Flash is the same as the interface for IDE, and requires more data lines to accomplish. I would also expect it to be more processor intensive. I&#039;m certain it can be done, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a practical mod.</p><p>I think a more practical mod would be to add a USB interface (which is in place on some ASUS models) to support external storage.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your replies guys.&nbsp; I think I made a terrible decision when I decided to buy all of my devices (Digicam, Mp3 player, PDA) in CompactFlash storage factor.<br />I&#039;d really like some more storage so I can install more packages onto the OpenWrt.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I am left with just three choices... 1. buy a SD card, 2. buy a Asus WL-500g Deluxe and use a flash drive, 3. or buy a Asus WL-HDD since I already have a 20 gig drive laying around.<br />I already have a USB flash drive, so buying the Asus WL-500G sounds like the best option for me at the moment... But my experience with flash drives have been terrible.&nbsp; I have had 2 of those die on me already.</p>									</div>

					<p>Remember that the WL-HDD takes 2.5&quot; HDD&#039;s (laptop size HDD&#039;s) - not standard 3.5&quot; drives.</p><p>Flash drives have a max-number-of-writes-problem - This you will not have with a real HDD.</p><p>As long as you dont use the FLASH device for /tmp or too write-intensive log files, I dont think there will be a problem....</p>									</div>

					<p>No wonder those drives died on me. Yes, I do want to write log files to it. I guess I can cross option #2 out.<br />One last question... Do SD medias have write limits like flash drives?<br />I do have a 2.5&quot; laptop drive.&nbsp; So I guess #3 may be a better choice since I do intend to write data constantly to the drive.&nbsp; With this option the drive can even be shared with the WRT54G.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lynden</strong> on 6 Feb 2006, 22:16)</p>

					<p>SD cards use Flash memory just like any other compact form factor memory device.&nbsp; At the moment, if it doesn&#039;t whirr when you turn it on, it&#039;s based on Flash.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks again for the help.&nbsp; I really appreciate the help guys!&nbsp; I&#039;m either going to buy the Asus WL-HDD or the Asus WL-500g w/ a usb enclosure.(Although I have read bad reviews on most of those USB enclosures)</p>									</div>
