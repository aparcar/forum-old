					<p>Hi, </p><p>This is my first time using openwrt (and am not the biggest Unix expert), so I&#039;m a bit new to this, so bear with me!</p><p>I have a Linksys WRT1900ACS and I just installed the latest Kaloz build that was posted on the Linksys wiki page: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900acs</a></p><p>I had a pretty easy time setting up all my previous router settings and DDNS, but I am getting hung up on getting some kmod-fs-* packages installed.&nbsp; Specifically, kmod-fs-exfat in order to support mounting my external hard drive and kmod-fs-hfsplus for Apple Time Machine support (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/timemachine">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/timemachine</a>).&nbsp; I am getting the following error:</p><p> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-fs-exfat:<br /> * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.18.20-1-d18786f7b70aa80793e6f77c59ad223e) * <br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-fs-exfat.</p><p>When I run opkg list-installed kernel I get the following:</p><p>kernel - 3.18.23-1-a45c302fa9f8d40e64ba3afe4d8f79c3</p><p>It looks like the kernel version that is installed is newer than what the available packages are built for.&nbsp; How do I go about installing these packages?&nbsp; Is the reason why my kernel is newer than expected because I downloaded it from Kaloz&#039;s branch instead of from the main download page?&nbsp; Is there a way to downgrade my kernel or get these packages to be built for 3.18.23?&nbsp; Or do I just have to start from scratch and download the regular version of OpenWRT?</p><p>Hopefully someone can help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chiefmongo</strong> on 28 Feb 2016, 23:17)</p>

					<p>How would I go about asking Kaloz for the built kmods?&nbsp; I found his user on the site, but I didn&#039;t see any way to PM him.</p><p>It&#039;s looking like my best bet (unless I can get ahold of Kaloz) is to probably just start over using the regular release binary.&nbsp; I was downloading the Shelby version of the firmware from Kaloz&#039;s site, but that doesn&#039;t seem to be available from the main download page: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/mvebu/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ u/generic/</a>&nbsp; I only see the WRT1900AC models listed here.</p><p>I see there is a Shelby version in the snapshot repo, but I don&#039;t think I would really want to use an unstable version.</p>									</div>

					<p>Now that I&#039;m reading through some more forum posts, it looks like building from the trunk might be the way to go for the WRT1900ACS.</p><p>How is the stability of the trunk?&nbsp; If I build from the trunk, do I need to download the kmod&#039;s right away otherwise they&#039;ll get overwritten by the next snapshot build?&nbsp; I see also that I have to use a mirror to download a snapshot... is this safe?&nbsp; Should I be concerned with malicious code bundled in?</p>									</div>
