					<p>About a year ago and IIRC, I did some tests on a plain (no encryption) NFS with a gigabit connection from a Linux Desktop Computer to my Seagate GoFLEX Home (with a SATA HDD capable of writing @60MBps) running on a self-built OpenWRT and was only able to get a 4 MBps (~ 32Mbps) write throughput using this <a href="https://github.com/AltraMayor/f3.git">F3</a> utility. When using the same <a href="https://github.com/AltraMayor/f3.git">F3</a> utility on my Seagate GoFLEX Home, I was able to get about 48 MBps write throughput. TBH, I don&#039;t know if this is a bottleneck on the NFS. But, I sure would like to resolve this issue and would appreciate if anyone here will like to offer some setting suggestions to improve this. Also, it certainly would be nice to know how you test your NFS connection throughput with its result.</p><p>FYI, the <em>hdparm</em> utility (running on my Seagate GoFLEX Home) reported the SATA HDD with the following results:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[root@GoFLEX:/root 3%] # hdparm -Tt /dev/sda
