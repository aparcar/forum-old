					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I am new to this forum and have only recently started playing with OpenWRT. I&#039;ve been mostly working with Sveasoft&#039;s firmware so far and have built a couple of tools that I thought I would share with you all since they also seem to work with OpenWRT.</p><p>I know they aren&#039;t great technical marvels but I still believe they might help a person or 2.</p><p>The first tool is called Easy Port Forward. It is a simple PHP iptables script generator that allows you to easily forward or redirect ports.</p><p>It is available at <a href="http://www.nucleosphere.com/EPF/">http://www.nucleosphere.com/EPF/</a></p><p>The second one is a replacement to chillispot&#039;s hotspotlogin.cgi script. Its meant as a proof of concept and works quite well... Its intended for people who want to customize their capture portal page.</p><p>It is available at <a href="http://www.nucleosphere.com/minispot/">http://www.nucleosphere.com/minispot/</a></p><p>Any suggestions/questions/feedback will be greatly appreciated :-)</p><p>Best regards to all</p><p>Coolhp</p>									</div>
