What does it depend on?<br />For exmple, on x86 machines it usually is a BIOS/Board issue only and got nothing to do with the CPU...</p><p>A kind of an alternative is to mount 2 SWAP-Partitions and mount the tmp on one of them. If you use only one partition, the decision what code remains in the RAM and which on goes on the SWAP is made by the software. I have no clue, how good it&#039;s decisions are. My (single) SWAP is barely used and the tmp only 1% &quot;full&quot;. Which is a huge waste. I am currently testing extroot, too. Everything but the bootloader on an huge USB Partition. =&gt; easy upgrades? ;-)</p><p>The (only) intriguig thing about this device so far, is it&#039;s low power consumption. Without it, I would rig up a x86-Board and run a rock-stable debian on it. Easy install, easy upgrades, huge performance boost and much more RAM. Without spending money, I&#039;d have 1GiB. The power consumtion is the problem. It&#039;s got to be around 5W.</p><p>Although I am not using samba/nfs that often it bothers me, that I can read with only 10MB/s and write with only 5-6MB/s. I was hoping for a solid 40MB/s read-write.</p><p>Well, 10/5MiB/s aren&#039;t that bad, and with a RAM endowment of 128MiB (minimum), it should be fine for a couple of years. Transmission is running on it, I&#039;m thinking of setting up /tor/ on it, too. maybe mail... you just gotta love the OpenSource-World. Of course, we will need security patches and easy upgrades for that to work out well... everything is exposed.</p><br /><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides contributing to the wiki and spreading the word, what else it there to do?</p><br /><p>As mentioned above, as soon as there are better performing machines with the same power consumption, I would most probably turn my back on OpenWrt and use Debian. But I do not expect this to happen all too soon, which means I see a point in putting a fair amount of effort into OpenWrt.</p><p>Guys, what do you think?</p>									</div>

					<p>Greetings!!</p><p>I&#039;ve a Linksys WRT54GL currently running OpenWRT Kamikaze 8.09 with X-WRT.<br />Following the steps in this guide <a href="http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Multi-Route">MRoute</a> I set up two WAN connections for a dualwan setup with load balancing (I&#039;ve two adsl lines and two modems connected right now). It rans rock solid for months with various clients connected.<br />However i&#039;ve two problems: first, network transfers over wifi are very slow (as opposed to 100 Mhbps cable of course) so I&#039;m wondering if it would be appropiate to move to wireless-N to increase speed.<br />Second, the flash memory of the unit is 4 mb only, which is not enough space to install all the packages I need. Some time ago I tried to do the sd-mod, soldering a SD card to the board, but it did not work (I tried several guides with no success). So, having the USB port would be very helpful.</p><p>Therefore, taking this two points in mind, I assume the TPLink TL-WR1043ND is the appropiate for the job. But... It would be possible to have the setup I&#039;ve described above with this router?</p><p>Some posts ago I seemed to read that there were some &quot;incompatibilities&quot; between the MIPS in this router and some packages (I wonder if this affects the &quot;mroute&quot; package) and also, and more important, I don&#039;t know if it is possible to re-assing a LAN port to WAN port in this unit.</p><p>If anyone can clarify me these doubts I would be very grateful.</p><p>Thanks in advance and excuse my terrible english (I&#039;m from Argentina).</p><p>Leo.</p>									</div>

The u-boot sources are also present for in the source code TL-WR941ND V4 and TL-WR741ND V1, and the code structure is similar for them. Maybe people would be more inclined to make their own customized images and change sources, if it were easier to recover from a bad flash.</p><p>Another option is that, if we look at listing from original firmware (page 1 of this topic):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Creating 5 MTD partitions on &quot;ar7100-nor0&quot;:
0x00000000-0x00020000 : &quot;boot&quot;
0x00020000-0x00120000 : &quot;kernel&quot;
0x00120000-0x007e0000 : &quot;rootfs&quot;
0x007e0000-0x007f0000 : &quot;config&quot;
0x007f0000-0x00800000 : &quot;art&quot;</code></pre></div><p>mtd0 is boot, mtd1 is kernel, mtd2 is rootfs. They don&#039;t contain a valid &quot;saveenv&quot;, do they? But it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to create a mtd1 0x4000 big partition (squeezed between u-boot and kernel), containing a valid saveenv environment <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />Edit: Or rather mtd2 partition between kernel and rootfs as 0x00020000 is hard coded as kernel&#039;s start address. But that I think, this can be changed in saveenv to eg. 0x00024000, so that mtd2 kernel could start from there. Anyhow, it would be better to modify u-boot code, as 0x4000 bytes would be saved.</p><p>Evaldas, I also tried to find, whether there is something in the TP-LINK sources (whole package, not only u-boot) containing either &quot;art&quot; or &#039;art&#039; (with either single or double quotes) - I couldn&#039;t find any references to it. Without qoutes, there are just too many words like STart&amp;PartITION to go through the search results manually (I used the built-in search, otherwise someone should search with something more powerful for single word of &quot;art&quot;). But it is probably referenced by its address (either flash chip size minus 0x1000 or absolute 0x007f0000). I think the partition is useless for OpenWRT as it is used only for saving the original firmware&#039;s settings to its &quot;NVRAM&quot;. The MAC and PIN number are written in mtd0 at its end - 1fc000 and 1fe000 respectively. If overwriting the u-boot code, make sure that 1f0000-1fffff erase block is not overwritten, as it contains MAC and PIN numbers.</p><p>Nough said...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>0x00</strong> on 19 Jun 2010, 21:43)</p>
