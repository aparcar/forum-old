					<p>Hello,<br />I discovered openwrt yesterday and I&#039;m very excited to use it. As far as my actual router doesn&#039;t supported it, I&#039;d like to buy a new modem/router/AP but I dont know which one. I&#039;d like to ask you for an advice. Which would you buy, for a reasonable price,&nbsp; if you had to ?</p><br /><p>Thanks for your help,<br />Tex.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tex-Twil</strong> on 28 Jan 2008, 11:43)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Yes, the Fonera is just a wireless AP.&nbsp; The Netgear WGT624 doesn&#039;t contain a modem either. If you want a built-in modem, you&#039;ll propably have to stick with the TI AR7 devices.</p><p>Regards,<br />Patrick</p>									</div>

					<p>EvilDevil,<br />it looks like there are not many compatible devices with AP and xDSL modem so I think I will use my old AP as a modem and buy a new AP just for kamikaze.
