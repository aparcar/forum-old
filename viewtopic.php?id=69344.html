					<p>@anarchy99,&nbsp; obviously it is not trivial, or somebody would have done it over the past 3 years the DIR-510L has been shipping.&nbsp; My question ---&nbsp; Is the lack of support because:</p><p>1) Small market penetration for this device, and thus small population of owners interested in putting in the effort</p><p>2) A significant &quot;show-stopper&quot; technical issue exists, that fundamentally prevents OpenWRT support. </p><p>That&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to figure out. I&#039;m will to put effort into developing, but I don&#039;t want to spend lots of time retracing effort that has already been done, and then independently discovering an insurmountable roadblock.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>timg11</strong> on 12 Jan 2017, 18:06)</p>

					<p>I found that hnyman posted to the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/d-link_dir-510l_a1">Wiki Page for the DIR-510L</a>.&nbsp; As far as can tell this board does not have private messaging. I&#039;d like to ask hynyman how the work with the DIR-510L concluded.&nbsp; Was it abandoned? If so was that due to lack of time or need, or was there a technical issue?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>timg11</strong> on 12 Jan 2017, 18:19)</p>

					<p>I love the little TP-Link routers, and I have one of them. However my goal with the DIR-510L is a travel router with WAN hotspot connection on 2.4 GHz, and LAN on 5 GHz.&nbsp; Does TP-link have any travel-size routers with 5 GHz dual-band support? I searched and did not find any.</p>									</div>
