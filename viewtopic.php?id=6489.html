					<p>here is an update:</p><p>i got the wrt54gl to talk to my netgear router in client mode via:</p><p>lan_ifname=vlan0<br />wifi_ifname=eth1<br />wl0_mode=sta<br />lan_proto=static<br />lan_ipaddr=192.168.2.2<br />wifi_proto=dhcp</p><p>then i scan for routers with iwlist and issued these command</p><p>ifdown wifi<br />nvram set wl0_ssid=NETGEAR<br />nvram set set wl0_channel=11<br />/sbin/wifi<br />ifup wifi</p><p>all the above worked and the wrt54gl was able to communicate with the<br />netgear router in client mode/non-bridged</p><p>the netgear is on the 192.168.1.0&nbsp; network<br />the wrt54gl is on the&nbsp; 192.168.2.0 network</p><p>the gateway is 192.168.1.1<br />the wrt54gl client router is fulling connected to the internet.</p><p>the problem is that my linux box which is connected via ethernet to the lan port is getting a gateway address of 192.168.2.2 which is not a gateway to the internet.<br />how can i get the linux box connected to the 192.168.1.1 gateway? how can <br />this be transparent with dhcpcd to the wrt54gl router (client router)?</p><p>thanks in advance</p><p>michael</p>									</div>

					<p>hi,<br />i have asus wl-500g router and i&#039;m trying to establish connection with ap located in my area but it seems i do something wrong, so i hope someone could help me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>so, i have asus wl-500g and, currently, one pc is connected to it over lan port (later i will probably connect another pc). i got all settings i need to connect to that ap (ssid, ip address, netmask, gateway address) but i&#039;m not sure how to set them. if i understand correctly wl-500g uses eth0 for lan, eth1 for wan and eth2 for wifi. i tried to follow instructions from client mode howto but it seems that i do something wrong. i suppose settings from lan are ok (i can connect to router from my pc) but when i try to ping remote computer (from router) nothing happens (wireless status on web interface is showing &quot;connecting to AP&quot;), signal to noise ratio is ok. i suppose that i didn&#039;t properly add settings for wifi, that is eth2, and i&#039;m not sure how to do it with nvram.</p><p>thanx.</p>									</div>
