					<p>Hi there,<br />I am new in OpenWrt stuff. I have an external HDD mounted on /mnt/shares. I would like to have an sftp server running on the router to access files on /mnt/shares. I would like to create a new user with password and use these credentials to connect via sftp to this share. I already have openssh-sftp-server package installed I just did not find how to configure it. Thanks a lot for your help.<br />Michal</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t need to configure the SFTP subsystem, it hooks seamlessly into the SSH server. All you need to do to make it available is setting a root password.</p><p>To add another user account to the system, you can install &quot;shadow-adduser&quot;, then run &quot;adduser username&quot; followed by &quot;passwd username&quot;.</p>									</div>
