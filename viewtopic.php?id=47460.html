					<p>Hi,</p><p>My router is WNDR3700 and currently running r37518 (arokh&#039;s build)<br />Currently I&#039;ve got 2 VLANS:<br />* VLAN 1 = regular network<br />* VLAN 2 = passthrough from WAN to LAN4 port.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/I8ei6sz.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/I8ei6sz.png" /></span></p><p>I would like to have LAN4 port also to be part of the regular network (VLAN1).<br />So the device connected to LAN4 has to receive 2 IP addresses.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BnKMcZD.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/BnKMcZD.png" /></span></p><p>So it should receive as well an external IP address from WAN as an internal IP address through DHCP.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to configure it with 2 VLAN&#039;s to the same port (VLAN 2 = untagged, VLAN3= tagged), but it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>Does anybody know how to configure it correctly?</p>									</div>

					<p>Usually the switch chips in these routers are limited in such a way that tagged+untagged on one port is not possible. What are you trying to accomplish anyway?</p>									</div>

					<p>Oow ok, this would explain a lot why it doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to connect a TV box to the network. Problem is that it needs an external IP... But it also has a possibility to connect to the computers through an internal IP (DLNA).</p><p>The issue is that it works when used in combination with a specific router (which has this possibility built-in, it has 2 VLANs). I would like to replicate that function.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the TV box certainly doesn&#039;t even have the capability to use two IP addresses. What you most likely need to do is create two VLANs on the LAN side, enable DHCP server on both (remember to serve IPs from different subnets), and in the firewall allow traffic between the VLANs. In addition, you need igmpproxy for the IPTV so that an external IP is not needed. I assume your ISP doesn&#039;t provide IPTV on a separate VLAN on the WAN side. If it does, the setup is slightly more complicated.</p><p>See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/udp_multicast">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/udp_multicast</a> for setting up igmpproxy, and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dmz">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dmz</a> for an example of setting firewall rules between VLANs.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is how I do it with kamikaze on my WRT54GL, so just adapt the config to whatever release you are using.</p><p>Basically, port 4 is the WAN port on the WRT54GL and that&#039;s the only thing connected to my HP switch. So, port 4 is a VLAN trunk for VLANs 1, 4, 12, 14, and 15. I added all those VLANs to the port on my HP switch that the WAN port is connected to, set the switch port configuration to &quot;Tagged Only&quot; with PVID 1.</p><p>The WAN port does not have an IP address at all, it&#039;s just a VLAN trunk. My management network is on VLAN 4, so you see I added a virtual interface on VLAN 4 for my management IP address.</p><br /><p>If you wanted to add, for example, port 3 on the Openwrt to vlan4 so you could connect your TV then you just write it like this: option vlan4 &quot;3 4t 5&quot;</p><p>--- /etc/config/network ---</p><p># Switch and VLANs<br />config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;4 5&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan4&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;4t 5&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan12&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;4t 5&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan14&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;4t 5&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan15&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;4t 5&quot;</p><p># Loopback interface<br />config interface loopback<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;lo&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;127.0.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.0.0.0</p><p># LAN interface<br />config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p><p># WAN interface<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.1&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; none</p><p># MGMT interface<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MGMT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;eth0.4&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp; 10.1.12.8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option gateway&nbsp; &nbsp;10.1.12.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option dns&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option netmask&nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.252.0</p><p># TEST bridge<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; test<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;eth0.12 wl0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;none<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /># MEDIA_TWO bridge<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; media_two<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;eth0.14 wl0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;none</p><p># GUEST bridge<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; guest<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;eth0.15 wl0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;none</p>									</div>
