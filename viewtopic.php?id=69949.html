					<p>Hi folks. There exists what looks to be the source for the &#039;proprietary&#039; bcm_nat module whose purpose is to speed up NAT transfers on some devices - could someone take a look and see if that&#039;s really what it is and can therefore be implemented in OpenWrt or if it&#039;s just a stub.</p><p>Can&#039;t post direct URLs here so I&#039;ll try my best.</p><p>sourceforge.net/p/wive-ng/wive-ng-rtnl/ci/5af495c5a38b76f781106789990811b5ec1bfddf/tree/linux-2.6.21.x/net/nat/bcm_nat</p>									</div>
