					<p>Hi all,</p><br /><p>I would like to know how to reproduce a stock OpenWRT image. So far, I walked through the&nbsp; howtos:</p><p>build system – Installation<br />build system – Usage</p><p>I made &#039;make menuconfig&#039;, and just selected the target board, but nothing else. After that, I ran &#039;make&#039;.</p><p>Is it enough to reproduce the same image like what I can download?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Levente</p>									</div>

					<p>I myself am not really accustomed with the OpenWRT Build System (I try to avoid headache sources), but you may also be interested in the Image Generator. (wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate)</p><p>The Image Generator is for those, who want to make their own OpenWRT Image, but without the headache of compiling the sources. All sources of the currently stable version are precompiled and you only have to select what you want to include into the OpenWRT Image.<br />Of course if you want to compile Trunk, Image Builder will be of no particular help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I have to recompile the kernel, because I want to fiddle with the GPIO multiplexer. For the first take, I want to reproduce the same image as I can download.</p><p>Anyways, I&#039;ll take a look at the generator.</p><p>Lev</p>									</div>
