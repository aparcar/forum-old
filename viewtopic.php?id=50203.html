					<p>These cheap things on ebay are sold by people who have no idea what they are selling and will just be copy and pasting the descriptions and using pre packaged photos. Usually the problem sellers also sell things like fake fingernails and aquarium ornaments.</p><p>Its really pot luck what you get, as the same cases are used with multiple boards inside, and then the manufacturers over there copy each others designs of things so you might find you get a copy and paste and photo from one seller, but the product only looks similar and was made in a totally different factory.</p><p>My suggestion would be only to buy from sellers who dont have a whole assortment of other stuff they sell, and are not using the same images as every other seller on there. That way they _may_ be able to answer questions about the product and not just copy and paste answers from someone else.</p>									</div>
