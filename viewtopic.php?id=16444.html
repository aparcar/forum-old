					<p>Hi,<br />After much messing around I have managed to compile trunk and get the kernel flashed onto a pronghorn metro. This was the easy part as I didn&#039;t realise that I also had to reflash the root file system!</p><p>In a practical world, I would not want to do this - is there a way of upgrading the old file system with the relevant modules that the trunk kernel needs? Or is the process make a list of all relevant configurations and installed packages then apply these to the new root fs?</p><p>Cheers,<br />Ade</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi adyb,</p><p>Working with stable kamikaze_7.09 on the prohnghorn Intel IXP4xx board worked out fine. </p><p>Now, I am experiencing a problem in upgrading kamikaze to the latest &quot;trunk&quot; for <br />the ADI pronghorn IXP425 board.&nbsp; </p><p>I just checkout svn latest version of the trunk and in the make menuconfig selected Intel Xscale IXP4xx with default profile.</p><p>After successful build, booting the image with openwrt-ixp&#039;xx-jffs2-128k.img rootfs on the board throws <br />....<br />VFS: Mounted root (jffs2 filesystem).<br />Freeing unused kernel memory: 128k freed<br />Please be patient, while OpenWrt loads ...<br />Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!</p><p>Also does the build setup on the latest trunk is changed ? like while building using kamikaze_7.09 i can find build_armeb, toochain_build_armeb and staging_dir_armeb whereas i didn&#039;t find it in latest trunk instead theres simply build_dir, toochain and staging_dir.</p><p>Could you pls clarify me and any idea would be really helpful.</p><p>Thanks<br />Sara</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sara</strong> on 20 Aug 2008, 13:26)</p>
