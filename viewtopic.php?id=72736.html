I&#039;m done with them.

I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m confused. Not that I ever wanted anything to do w/ LEDE any ways. Figured they can&#039;t be that different (for this issue) in such a short amount of time. But I will go to the dark side if I have to.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>langly</strong> on 9 Dec 2017, 04:28)</p>
