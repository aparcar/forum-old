					<p>I&#039;m trying to revive an old linksys router (WRT300Nv1.1). i tried dd-wrt with temporary success but it keeps going down. <br />maybe its due to faulty hardware. <br />Anyways i&#039;m looking to try openwrt and the only success story i found - quoted below - and it involves generating an image/build root. </p><p>I&#039;m not very computer savy but I do I have a linux os, so i think I could try building an image. <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>boblfoot wrote:</cite><blockquote><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33937">SOURCE:</a><br />Success and closure.&nbsp; The Linksys WRT300Nv1.1 is now 10.03.1 with ipv6 and a web page for configuration.</p><p>Bottom Line as of 2012-06-04 only the 2.4 kernel version of backfire with broadcom-57xx module if built from image generator or build root works with my Linksys WRT300Nv1.1.&nbsp; Date of Manufacture 9/2007.</p></blockquote></div><p>anyone know what command lines i need to write into the linux terminal to make such a file for me to then flash?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paprika</strong> on 21 Feb 2015, 15:56)</p>

					<p>I think you complicate it for yourself:<br />The WRT300Nv1.1 seems reasonably supported. It is listed under Work-in-progress:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wip">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wip</a><br />But seems ok from 10.03.1.</p><p>You can download the firmware here (I doubt it would be in the 14.07 tree if it does not work at all):<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm47xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ x/generic/</a><br />The usual advice is to flash from OEM firmware (not from DD-WRT).</p><p>Obviously the Wiki documentation is not completely up-to-date and consistent. If you want to help the community, post your findings about the router here (or even better, update the Wiki, but posting here is better than nothing). Also, you may want to change the topic name to something like &quot;status of WRT300N 1.1&quot; to get help.</p><p>And to answer your question... if you want to build a firmware yourself, download the Image Builder from the same folder as the firmware above. You can read more about the Image Builder (sometimes called Image Generator) on the Wiki.</p><p>Finally a disclaimer: I have never used a WRT300N 1.1. The documentation/status is obviously a bit unclear. I doubt you will destroy/brick the router with the 14.07 firmware I directed you to. But I dont know and I guarantee nothing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot, i actually found the one success case from the wip link you posted. <br />I figured i&#039;d have to do the same thing he did. </p><p>I couldn&#039;t find the oem firmware so i went ahead and flashed it in the current dd-wrt which i was lucky enough to access as it was being finicky. </p><p>I was successful at getting the openwrt firmware installed. It worked fine i set my wifi ssid with security etc... I then disconnected it powered it off so I could place it in my basement. <br />Now it stopped working again i can no longer access it via <a href="http://192.168.1.1/">http://192.168.1.1/</a><br />all i get is a black screen with LuCI - Lua Configuration Interface</p><p>tried hard reset but still no go. </p><p>the power led won&#039;t turn on. only the led indicating where the ethernet cables are plugged light up.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paprika</strong> on 21 Feb 2015, 21:07)</p>
