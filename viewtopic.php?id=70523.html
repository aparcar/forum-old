					<p>Hi everyone.</p><p>I&#039;d like to install an official openwrt release on an Askey RTF3505VW-GV, the last router Spanish ISP movistar is giving their clients. This router includes an ONT, Gigabit Ethernet and 2.4 &amp; 5 GHz wireless, so it can be very useful with openwrt.</p><p>As I have seen on bootlog, maybe the installed firmware is based on openwrt:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Base: 4.14_04Apatch3

					<p>I am also interested on this. I would like to explore if<br />It could be done. I guess the first step should be to have jtag console access, and also if we could have console access to the current firmware could be useful too.</p>									</div>
