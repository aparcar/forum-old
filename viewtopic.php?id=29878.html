					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m having a rather strange problem.&nbsp; I&#039;ve recently been playing with openwrt on my old wrt54g v2 router..</p><p>I sucessfully flashed from the Linksys firmware to backfire 10.03 (openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin), used that for a bit then decided to try Gargoyle&#039;s firmware for the realtime graphs.&nbsp; I was able to flash their .bin via atftp.&nbsp; Then I found out about openwrt&#039;s luci-app-statistics package so I went back to openwrt again to try that (openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx).&nbsp; This time I uploaded the firmware to /tmp on the router and used <br />mtd -r write /tmp/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx linux</p><p>No problems so far.</p><p>Finally I decided to build a custom firmware image so all the software I want is in the squashfs filesystem.&nbsp; I downloaded and extracted OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-brcm47xx-for-Linux-i686.tar.bz2 and ran:</p><p>make image PACKAGES=&quot;kmod-ipt-nathelper-extra tc mini-snmpd luci-app-statistics luci-app-qos -kmod-ppp -kmod-pppoe -ppp -ppp-mod-pppoe&quot;</p><p>This produced the firmware in bin/brcm47xx/ as expected.&nbsp; I uploaded the trx file to the router&#039;s /tmp direcroty and flashed it via mtd same as before<br />-rw-rw-r-- 1 nveber nveber 3018752 May&nbsp; 3 22:53 openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</p><p>I thought maybe this file would be too large, but mtd didn&#039;t complain.&nbsp; It flashed the trx file and rebooted.&nbsp; Aparently something went wrong as after that point, I can no longer get to my router (can&#039;t ping, telnet ssh, or reach the web interface).</p><p>When I plug in the power the dmz light comes on after a bit and the power light starts flashing, a while later the dmz light goes off the flashing stops (light turns solid), and it looks like everything is booted fine, yet its just not responding to any network packets on 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; I even tried re-flashing via atftp, by sending the official .bin and even .trx files to the router before the dmz comes on, but that just times out as well.&nbsp; I also tried failsafe mode, but no matter how many times I push the reset button while the dmz light is on (booting), it never starts to flash, or make any difference.</p><p>Any idea what the problem might be or how I can fix it?&nbsp; Its almost like the firmware is missing a network driver or something?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Primus</strong> on 4 May 2011, 16:12)</p>

					<p>The firmware is most likely missing libuci. You can access and reflash the router with failsafe. See the wiki for this.<br />TFTP flash is not related to the firmware at all, the failure here is just a coincidence and most likely related to bad timing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm&nbsp; yes that does appear to be missing:</p><p>$ ls build_dir/target-mipsel_uClibc-0.9.30.1/root-brcm47xx/usr/lib/opkg/info/lib*<br />libc.list&nbsp; &nbsp; libiptc.list&nbsp; libnl-tiny.list&nbsp; librrd1.list&nbsp; libuci-lua.list<br />libgcc.list&nbsp; liblua.list&nbsp; &nbsp;libpthread.list&nbsp; librt.list&nbsp; &nbsp; libxtables.list</p><p>Shouldn&#039;t pretty much everything (or at least base-files and uci) depend on libuci ensuring its installed?</p><p>I will try the failsafe mode again later today although I couldn&#039;t get it it to work yesterday for some reason.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>The only way I could get it to work again was to short the pins on the flash chip as described here except I had to short pin 16 &amp; 17 to get it working (just started trying random ones).</p><p><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net:81/redhat/wrt54g_revival.html">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net:81/redhat â€¦ vival.html</a></p><p>The firmware I built with the command above was missing several essential packages: libuci, kmod-b43 and kmod-b43legacy</p><p>It seems like if you pass the PACKAGES= option, it will not install any of the PLATFORM= packages..&nbsp; Would be nice if the documentation mentioned this.&nbsp; Even if the default platform packages were installed, I think libuci would probably still be missing!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Primus (and everyone),</p><p>I see you have succeeded on flashing your WRT54G V2 from Linksys software. I try to do the same, I wish to use openwrt with nocat. Unfortunately, the flash fails everytime I try...<br />I expect my Linksys firmware is responsible of the failure: please, would you tell me what is (was) your Linksys firmware? Mine is v4.20.8 (the last one, I think). I have Googled a lot, searching for an older firmware, without any success at this time..<br />I thank you in advance for any help you may give me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, it works now. I used the firmware update from WRT54G menu, as I have done before. And this time was the good one .....</p>									</div>
