					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I would like to test to replace a ADSL2+, pppoe, router with an OpenWRT one.<br />Unfortunatelly reading in internet seems that DSL stuff are a pain ... so, do you have any suggestion ?</p><p>The only real requirements are 4+ (gigabit) ports, a minimum cpu, ram and disk able to implement some VPNs, a bit of firewalling and traffic analisys&nbsp; (maybe a usb port)</p><p>A cheap device will be appreciated</p><p>wifi capabilities are not (strictly) needed</p><p>PS: I need a single device and not a second router in bridge</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Buy a <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wbmr-hp-g300h">Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H</a></p><p>It&#039;s not a very cheap device, but it&#039;s the most reliable choice when it comes to ADSL@OpenWrt.<br />It has 4 gigabit ports, 32MB of Flash Memory (that&#039;s important, because you probably won&#039;t need to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">extroot</a> it), 64MB of RAM and 1 USB 2.0 port.</p><p>Migration from stock firmware to OpenWrt is pretty easy, you first flash <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com">dd-wrt</a> and then flash OpenWrt. There are instructions on the Wiki.</p><p>There also some TP-Link devices like <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8970">TD-W8970 (V1 only, not V3)</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8980">TD-W8980</a> but they have 8MB of Flash Memory,so extroot is inevitable, especially if you want to setup things like VPN, traffic stats etc.</p><p>Another important thing about these TP-Link modem-routers is that they will probably come with a firmware that won&#039;t allow an easy migration from stock firmware to OpenWrt and you will have to solder pins to the board and use a USB to TTL serial cable to flash OpenWrt. So... in few words, I don&#039;t recommend them.</p><p>Hope you find the above info uselful.<br />Cheers! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 2 Sep 2016, 22:42)</p>

But 8 MB should be just fine for anything smaller than what shouldn&#039;t realistically be run on router hardware anyway.</p><p>By the way, I still would have to advise against the W8970. It takes a good amount of effort to get it running, as you say. And if it&#039;s running, it&#039;s not completely &quot;smooth&quot;, as in &quot;sometimes the logfile yells around a lot about errors&quot;. Maybe that will get better, or maybe it has already, I haven&#039;t tried anything beyond CC in the last months on my W8970.</p><p>My general advice would be to get a router, and get a modem. It&#039;s just much less hassle that way. You&#039;re <em>very</em> limited if you&#039;re looking for an all-in-one solution, and you&#039;d miss out on otherwise great hardware just because it doesn&#039;t come with a modem built in.</p>									</div>

					<p>We all have different needs.<br />For me, 8 MB of flash is too little.</p><p>I have setup samba, freeradius, openvpn server, multiwan, I have php support in uhttpd, I need extra packages for 3G modem access, etc etc... It&#039;s not necessary that all services run simultaneously. I enable them whenever I need/want to run them.</p><p>So, I don&#039;t think we should argue about that.</p><p>As for the &quot;advise against the W8970&quot;, I agree but I should also point out that the same thing happened with the WBMR-HP-G300H. There were problems in older releases, but now is rock solid, at least for me. It got better and better, release by release. I don&#039;t know if the same thing will happen to the TD-W* devices, I guess we&#039;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>Cheers! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 2 Sep 2016, 23:29)</p>

					<p>Thanks to both of you.</p><p>As supposed DSL HW is a problem so I&#039;m changing a little the specs:<br />what about a pair of devices ... maybe with the modem powered by router USB port (otherwise I&#039;ll evaluate to use the bridge) </p><p>Do you have any further suggestion ?</p><p>Thanks again<br />Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>If you don&#039;t mind using a second hand device, the Netgear DGN3500/DGN3500B (depending on whether you need Annex A or B DSL support), will give you all you need.</p><p>My experience with the 3500 (Annex A) on the last three OpenWRT releases has been solid, as long as the ADSL modem firmware is updated to a newer version than that shipped. Details in the discussion thread.</p><p>Interestingly, although early days into testing, the packaged ADSL firmware is solid using the LEDE trunk builds, which implies the problem with ADSL disconnections in OpenWRT lies elsewhere.</p><p>DGN3500 info: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dgn3500b">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dgn3500b</a></p><p>DGN3500 discussion thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24195">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24195</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>Richard</p>									</div>

					<p>My 2c. Have a look at BThomehub 5A. Trunk support, lots of flash and ram, gig lan ports, has lantiq vdsl and adsl (only annex A though for adsl). Can be had on cheap, just look on ebay.</p><p>Beats Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H is all parameters (processor speed, ram,flash size....).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dziny</strong> on 4 Sep 2016, 14:33)</p>
