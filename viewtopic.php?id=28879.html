					<p>Hi everybody</p><p>ive got a problem finding the soldering points for serial connection on my TP-Link tl-wr741nd</p><p>theres a tutorial on your page<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd</a></p><p>but ive got version 2.0 and the tut is for older versions</p><br /><p>theres only one hint about v2.0 on the page <br />&quot;For this new revision its TP4?Tx and TP5?Rx in the center of PCB. &quot;</p><p>?? but where to solder the GND and 3.3V wire ??<br />do i need the 10k pullup resistor?</p><p>ive made a pic of the new board<br /><a href="http://img600.imageshack.us/i/img20110301194820.jpg/">http://img600.imageshack.us/i/img20110301194820.jpg/</a></p><p>i really need to get the serial connection to work...<br />im doing my bachelor thesis, im late, i killed a lot of routers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>any help is appreciated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>thanks for reading</p>									</div>

					<p>apparently there are only the RX and TX pins on the router board, you probably will have to get the energy from somewhere else on the board. But at least it appears they removed the capacitor that was messing with the TX signal.</p><p>btw, did you remove the wifi shield from the board or this new version doesn&#039;t come with one at all?</p><p>Another thing I saw, on this version the antenna pig tail is passing pretty near an unshield inductor, that&#039;s gotta cause some interference. On the previous versions the inductor was on the other side of the board.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>felipevp</strong> on 30 Mar 2011, 08:33)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t know if you have tried it but a technique I use is as follows:</p><p>!!Read all of this before doing anything. Make sure the router is powered off before you start!!<br />No warranties with this method. Given as information.</p><p>1. Ensure you have a 3.3 volt TTL to rs232 level shifter.</p><p>2. Get a small battery pack with 2 each 1.5 volt batteries and some short aligator clips. Two&nbsp; standard &quot;c&quot; cell will last for hours.</p><p>3. Connect the 3 volt source to your level shifter (note polarity)&nbsp; and connect to your terminal program.</p><p>4. Set your baud rate generally to 115200 bps.</p><p>5. Connect the ttl tx and rx leads together without touching the router and type on your terminal to ensure all is working, you should see your text.</p><p>6. Identify your rx ttl lead on your level shifter and connect it with a jumper to a test lead from a voltmeter. Wrap some electrical tape down to just before the tip<br />in case it moves and you don&#039;t want to cause &quot;sparks&quot;...kinda bad on the router. </p><p>NOTE STEP 10. You have to identify ground...if you have external antennas then generaly the outer shell is ground.<br />Also note your level shifter ground and make sure it has the SAME POLARITY ground as your router...generally -ve is ground on both but double check!</p><br /><p>7. Power up your router and put the test lead on those points you think are the suspect rs232 tx data points.</p><p>8. If you are lucky the first time you should see the data scrolling on the terminal. This is the router tx pin. You may have to do this several times.</p><p>9. Once you are sure then you can solder that on. Use the same method for the rx pin on the router using the level shifter tx pin this time. You will have to hit enter or control C to get the rx on the router to respond.&nbsp; Once you find it solder it on.<br />Note that sometimes these are disabled and you have to use more drastic methods....jtag?</p><p>10 To identify the +3.3 volts and ground I find that identifying by the ram chip and then getting the data sheet and locating the pins for voltage and ground and then using VOM continuity tests will quickly narrow them down. I try to find a large solder pad or larger component to solder too for a secure connection.</p><p>11. You may have to do a bit of hunting if you are not sure but generally this method works for me and I&#039;ve done it dozens of times. Once you are on enable telnet or better ssh and log in.</p><p>12. A few cautions: this method exposes your router and is subject to mistakes so be carefull. Never make a connection if you have any doubt about what you are doing as making one wrong connection can wipe out your router. It is best to use good antistatic practices such as not walking on carpets, grounding your self (touching the frame of your pc or some other known ground).<br />It helps to have some electrical or better some electronics experience or some nearby who has.</p><p>hope this helps.</p><p>~john</p>									</div>
