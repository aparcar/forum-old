					<p>Never mind, I figured out a few things while putting the device to 8.09, I didn&#039;t do it by hand I used the LaFonia loader but only after I figured out a few things.</p><p>#1 A fix for the Meraki Mini mysterious 5min reboot.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a software fix but I&#039;m sure someone could probe the running state of the original firmware to find out.&nbsp; The fix is a hardware fix, I just happened to notice this ONLY happens when the secondary board that has the LED lights is attached.&nbsp; When I work with the top off, via JTAG or Ethernet stable as can be, mate it back up and every 5 minutes a reboot.&nbsp; I&#039;m just going to remove the board.</p><p>#2 Having found the reboot fix the system could take its time and flash properly and moving to version 8.09 I got the great use of a web interface and I looked around as I don&#039;t know all the commands and found in the advanced section and system\software the package list.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m not sure about 7.09 but 8.09 comes with hostapd-mini (this is the package that handles the encryption) Mini only supports WPA-PSK, not verion2, not wep just WPA-PSK.&nbsp; From that page I removed hostapd-mini, had it install hostapd (full) the utils for it and while I was at it I installed the wpa_supplicant as well.</p><p>Finally anyone searching here is what a working protected config:</p><p>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;wifi0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;atheros&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;channel&#039; &#039;auto&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;hwmode&#039; &#039;11bg&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;disabled&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;diversity&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;wifi0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;ap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;NETWORK&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;key&#039; &#039;KEY&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;psk2&#039;</p><p>Note if you are doing this by hand you must also configure hostpd:<br />the file /var/run/hostapd-ath0.conf looks like:</p><p>ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd-ath0<br />driver=madwifi<br />interface=ath0<br />hw_mode=g</p><p>bridge=br-lan<br />ssid=NETWORK<br />debug=0<br />wpa=2<br />wpa_pairwise=CCMP</p><p>wpa_passphrase=KEY</p><br /><p>In closing so far in writing the mini rebooted once maybe twice, and has now been running for 21 mintues now.&nbsp; I have not tested if it will restart a few times and then run after powering off.</p>									</div>
