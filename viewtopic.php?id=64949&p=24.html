					<p>Thanks again for taking care of us David. Maybe one day I will get around to compiling myself, but you make it so easy not to :-)</p><p>Loaded up your 11/26 build this evening on my ACSv1 (was waiting for the switch change to be reverted), and so far so good. Some packages I use (and wanted to use) installed just fine. Adblock being one of them, with its pre-req packages as well.</p><br /><br /><p>On a side note, I know you mentioned it before about needing some MOAR!!! horsepowa for compiling on. I have a good amount of X99 hardware in the basement (Xeons and regular i7), and I would be willing to help you out if you are in the market for an upgrade. And what I mean is a very nice discount on some hardware for a build, not free :-) I am not that rich. If you are interested, let me know and we can talk further by some other more private means.

					<p>Dear David,</p><p>thank you for providing your excellent builds!</p><p>I bought a WRT1900AC v1 when they first came out and after being so frustrated and disappointed with Linksys original toy firmware I swapped to OpenWrt but had too many performance problems so my router ended up in its box for 1 year. I brought it out again and have been running OpenWrt with OK results the last year and just recently I thought I&#039;d give your LEDE build (Lede Torero r1967 / LuCI Master (git-16.298.34250-95358ab)) a try.</p><p>WOW!&nbsp; Very smooth running! Very stable and performance is acceptable even if I still seem to have some speed issues on MacBook Pro and Air running 2.4GHz. But in overall, great build and very, very stable!</p><p>Thank you again, and please keep up the good work!</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting about folks having issues. I have 2321 installed on my wrt1900acs v1 and not experiencing any issues. Has been up for 2.5 days.

					<p>I would guess it probably is client device specific. I have a laptop with Intel wireless NIC, PC with Asus USB AC56 NIC, Amazon Fire TV, Roku 3, iPhone 6s. All of these get used. Have 2 other i Phones that connect, but only use the wireless for calling.&nbsp; Only true Android device I have is 2.4 only. Of course the Fire and Roku are Android. No Apple laptops or desktops. Apple devices seem to be the problem children from what I remember reading different reports on various firmware versions both Openwrt/LEDE and DD-WRT. </p><p>I to like david&#039;s builds. I do load up DD-WRT when a new version comes out just to see how it looks. Always find that my simple iperf test of the 5GHz wireless always says Openwrt/LEDE wins the race. In all fairness, DD-WRT is closing the gap. Also like the Luci interface better then DD-WRT. Have also loaded up Gargoyle, based on Openwrt, a couple of times. Interesting firmware, but they do not seem to stay current with builds, especially wireless drivers. Of course they have more to test and modify before they put out a new build and I think it is only a couple of guys supporting multiple vendor routers. </p><p>--bill</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello david,</p><p>I use your firmware since november and had a great experience with the version you released end of november, it was stable for over a month with no problems.</p><p>Until I updated, right now I&#039;m at the latest version you released on 2016-11-26 with two WRT1900ACS.<br />I did a factory reset on both after and while upgrading and configured them from the beginning.</p><p>Since then the wifi is really unstable. I can&#039;t use all the channels, with most the wifi won&#039;t work anymore.

I&#039;ll roll back to the older version for now.</p><p>Thanks a lot for your great firmware and your great support.</p><p>Also found a bug:<br />If I update your firmware and keep settings enables checked, all of my installed software is getting uninstalled.
