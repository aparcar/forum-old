					<p>Hi,</p><p>I use a Netgear DGND3700v1 with Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; LEDE Reboot 17.01.1 r3316-7eb58cf109 / LuCI lede-17.01 branch (git-17.100.70571-29fabe2).</p><p>I experience quite slow internet connection on this one. On stock firmware I get my 250 Mbit/s internet connection but through the latest code I only get about 160 Mbit/s ( on a good day with sun in my back, downhill).<br />I&#039;ve done the tests several times and it&#039;s definitely the openwrt firmware that screw the speed up.<br />Internally on the lan I have almost full 1 gig so that&#039;s ok, but I suppose that&#039;s just the external switch in this product causing that, since nothing will be routed thorough the router then I guess..<br />I use the same service to test the internet speed and I have also, to verify my internet connection doesn&#039;t vary between the installs, unplugged the fiber to the router, and put it straight into my pc and I get 255+ Mbit/s.<br />I&#039;ve verified this back and forth 3 times now.</p><p>Please advice, since I did not expect throughput problems like this.<br />(Also, please not, I&#039;m extremely new on openwrt, so if there&#039;s a possibility I&#039;ve screwed things up initially, just let me know.) <br />I use the router without wifi, and the only change I&#039;ve made to the config is changing the ip number of the dhcp server to 192.168.0.1)<br />If you want any logs etc, please let me know!<br />Kind regards<br />Hjalmar</p>									</div>

					<p>My two cents:<br />* This is the OpenWrt forum; if you installed LEDE, there is a LEDE forum.<br />* This behaviour is expected: OpenWrt / LEDE (still) does not do hardware NAT.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I suppose that is the reason? however why is stock fw so much faster?<br />Also, is there any way to mend this?</p><p>atb</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s easy: OpenWrt / LEDE does not do hardware NAT. stock firmware does hardware NAT. You can buy a faster router, revert to stock firmware, or join the people that is trying to get fastpath or hardware NAT to LEDE: <br /><a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/qualcomm-fast-path-for-lede/4582">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/qualco … -lede/4582</a><br /><a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/hardware-nat-for-lede/1094">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/hardwa … -lede/1094</a></p>									</div>

					<p>The openwrt wiki page for that model mentions an overclock mod.&nbsp; It&#039;s not going to make the difference between 160 and 250 though.</p><p>I think that fastpath has been done on LEDE, but only for Atheros chips.</p>									</div>
