					<p>Hi. I have this router here, he uses the QCA9533-BL3A chip and uses a 4MB flash, it&#039;s identical to the v10 841ND, but I cannot flash the image for web browser or even by TFTP method, it does not work, the router refuses to update:</p><p>Error code: 18005<br />The update failed due to the incorrect version of the updated file. Check the file name.</p><p>I read that maybe it only need a compiled version with the #define tl-wr840n-v2, because its hardware identical to the V10, but I don&#039;t know how to compile OpenWrt, I&#039;m afraid that is beyond my knowledge... </p><p>I tried to hex edit the file, I downloaded the V10 bin file from OpenWRT (wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd) and using as reference the makefile (dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile?rev=49217) I searched 08 41 00 10 and changed that to 08 40 00 02, that is the hardware id from the 840n v2, but also the router refused to update. </p><p>Can anyone compile this with the 840n v2 variables on the makefile?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frcentoz</strong> on 23 Dec 2016, 14:46)</p>
