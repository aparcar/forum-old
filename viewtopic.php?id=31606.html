					<p>Is it the explosive news to you that Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple Inc? He is absolutely the hero and legend of the time for he launched the Apple Inc and release many classic and advanced products like iPad, iPhone, iPhone 4 and iPad 2. I admire him very much and he is my idol forever. And I like iPad the most among numerous brands of tablets. </p><p>Usually, I use iPad to watch movies whether they are iPad compatible formats or not resorting to the powerful converting software <strong><a href="http://www.ipadvideoconverters.com/">iPad Video Converter</a></strong>. With it I can convert any video format to iPad easily and directly. I got the program through the <strong><a href="http://www.ipadvideoconverters.com/ipad-video-converter-review/">iPad Video Converter Review </a></strong> to compare and choose the best software. </p><p>Iâ€™d like to share the powerful functions of this iPad video converter.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.ipadvideoconverters.com/images/ipad-video-converter/avi-to-ipad-video-converter/interface.jpg" alt="http://www.ipadvideoconverters.com/images/ipad-video-converter/avi-to-ipad-video-converter/interface.jpg" /></span></p><p>iPad video converter is specially designed for iPad users to convert any video format like MPG, MPEG, MPEG 2, VOB, DAT, MP4, M4V, TS, RM, RMVB, WMV, ASF, MKV, AVI, 3GP, 3G2, FLV etc to iPad in fast conversion speed and high image and sound qualities. Extracting audio from any video file and converting it to iPad audio format are allowed.</p><p>Apart from that, I always use this iPad video converter to customize the output files through the powerful editing function. For instance, I can merge, trim and crop videos, adjust video effects, and add watermark to videos. All these operations are very easy. Just a few clicks; it is OK. Then you can enjoy the converted videos on iPad comfortably and conveniently.</p><p>The excellent software is really beyond my description. And if you like Jobs, if you like ipad, you can try this converter. What is more, <strong><a href="http://www.ipadvideoconverters.com/ipad-video-converter-for-mac/">iPad Video Converter for Mac </a></strong> is available for Mac users. Come on, guys!</p>									</div>
