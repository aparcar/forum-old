					<p>How do I enable/disable a daemon at build time (so it ends up in ROM)? </p><p>I.e., I want to disable p910nd by default at boot, since I have a hotplug script that starts it when I switch on my usb-connected printer. However, after updating to a new openwrt build, p910nd is enabled by default. I first need to do:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/p910nd stop
/etc/init.d/p910nd disable</code></pre></div><p>How do I compile/build that into the image? I can&#039;t figure out if there are any modifications needed to the Makefile.

					<p>I asked that about a year ago, and did not get a good answer. If I remember correctly, there is no standard way to included a daemon package in &quot;disabled&quot; status in the build. If the package is there and gets installed and has a startup script, it gets started.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=126668#p126668">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 68#p126668</a></p><p>You might edit the startup script not to actually start it, or something like that.</p><p>You might also try to utilise the scripts in that wiki article you linked: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages#packaging.a.service">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packa … .a.service</a><br />Although I am not sure if we are able to place those commands at the startup path somehow.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 13 Jun 2012, 16:40)</p>

					<p>The boot() procedure is called on boot. By default it simply calls start, if you override it with a no-op, the init script will run on boot but do nothing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see... I just checked, and indeed <strong>/rom</strong>/etc/rc.d/S95miniupnpd does exist, is called, but does nothing because of boot() is overridden in the init-script.

					<p>Aha! And right after the first boot after flash, /etc/uci-defaults is cleared... Interesting to see what is in /rom/etc/uci-defaults. Now I can also enable minidlna, the same thing happens there: <a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/browser/luci/trunk/applications/luci-minidlna/root/etc/uci-defaults/luci-minidlna">http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/browser/ … i-minidlna</a></p><p>I will test this as soon as I get past this: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12813.">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12813.</a> It seems arokh has solved it though, he has it in his latest build (<a href="http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/dangerous_overclock/r35257/packages/">http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/d … /packages/</a>) but I have not heard from him how he managed to do it.</p>									</div>
