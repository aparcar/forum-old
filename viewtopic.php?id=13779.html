					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have 2 routers:</p><p>- one with whiterussian which is my principal router<br />-one with kamikaze to make some tests</p><p>Since few days, the french adsl operator free give us the possibility to have ipv6, it gives us a xxx/64 bloc.</p><p>My router manages to have an ipv6 on his wan interface, and now I have to give ipv6 adresses of the computers of my lan xith radvd.</p><p>So I try to do rules with ip6tables.</p><p>I remark that I can&#039;t use the module state in ip6tables (in whiterussian rc5 and kamikaze 7.09), which is essential for me to share the ipv6 connection, because in default, all is isopen, so I prefere block all, and open what I need.</p><p>Is it possible to do that and if not, how rules can&nbsp; I make to replace that?</p><p>PS: I post that in whiterussian and kamikaze section, because I have both.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thierry_b</strong> on 16 Dec 2007, 11:00)</p>
