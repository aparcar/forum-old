					<p>I have a Dlink DIR-615 router and I am trying to make its lan and wlan integrate with the wan. My setup goes like this:</p><p>Internet &gt;&gt; M0n0wall Computer for main network &gt;&gt; switch (WAN) and computers &gt;&gt; Dlink dir-615 )) WIFI )) Computers</p><p>I want the computers on the OpenWrt wifi network to be on the same LAN as the computers on the switch. I have tried setting some of the bridging options in the settings but it mostly ends up locking me out of the router and I have to reflash. Any help would be great!</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I need the switch. The dir-615 is connected to the switch to give me wifi. I want the computers on the wifi to act just like they are connected directly to the switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you have the wrong idea/approach. You don&#039;t need to &quot;integrate wifi and lan with wan&quot;. You don&#039;t need an wan interface at all. <br />If you want to brigde the LAN(+wifi) of dir-615 with the LAN behind your monowall/switch just do so. Disconnect the WAN-port of the dir-615, set an IP for the LAN-Interface of the dir-615 which is in the same subnet as the monowall, and than just connect a LAN-port of the dir-615 to the switch. make sure the wan-interface has no static ip assigned in the same subnet, and reboot the dir-615<br />If the monowall should do all the dhcp- and firewallstuff, you need to disable it on the dir-615:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable
/etc/init.d/firewall disable</code></pre></div><p>If you want to use the &quot;unused&quot; wan-port as a 5th LAN-port look at the switch/vlan-docs orca posted</p>									</div>

					<p>This worked great, thank you very much for the help. My reasons for this is I sometimes have LAN parties and sometimes people show up with laptops. I wanted them to be able to join in on the fun simply by connecting to the wifi.</p>									</div>
