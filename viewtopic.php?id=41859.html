					<p>Well I used to be in possession of a WRT54G and had Openwrt on it, if I remember right it gives you the option the manually map the ports on your device. This is the main reason I need Openwrt on my device cause the way I want to use it is not possible with it&#039;s current setup limitations.</p><p>I hope this answers your question</p><br /><p>Edit: as for the DOCSIS part I wanna see if I can use my device to route my video over the local network. See I work with video editing and I have an Ethernet interface through which I put all my video/audio before it goes into my Computer through high speed. What I want to be using it for is to offer my video crew to upload recorded video from any place (with a coax connection nearly every building around here) right to my studio. How I would accomplish this is a whole other story though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blackieychan</strong> on 30 Jan 2013, 02:59)</p>

					<p>Just trying to keep this thread alive, I have found out that I might be able to use the AR71XX firmware to flash my modem, it has the exact same chipset as the above mentioned. I&#039;m wondering though if I would be able to use DOCSIS in this setup anyone might be able to help me out on this??</p>									</div>

					<p>I haven&#039;t had any time to spend on this project since I&#039;ve been kinda busy @college</p><p>I did find a way to decrypt/descramble our directTV signal and am currently using the modem as a receiver and as a mediacentre through its LAN ports. It&#039;s a cheap and very silent alternative to watch TV &amp; stream your content of the network.</p><p>Still haven&#039;t figured out how I could utilize it to use internet &amp; VoIP though. Guess I&#039;m just hoping that the OpenWrt guys will develop DOCSIS support in the near future.</p>									</div>
