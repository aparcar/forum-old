					<p>Hi.</p><p>I&#039;m now googling for hours and using the searchfunction of this forum, but i can&#039;t find any working solutions for me.<br />A friend of mine told me it&#039;s possible to program a WRT160NL without a serial cable. Only with tftp... Well...<br />I can&#039;t put the *.bin file onto it. I also don&#039;t know if i got into the boot mode or could abort the u-boot process.</p><p>What I&#039;ve tried is:<br />============</p><p>- Turning on the Router while holding the reset button.<br />- Continue holding the reset button for 15-20 seconds.<br />- Releasing the reset button.<br />- Trying to put the openwrt on the router.</p><p>I&#039;ve set a static ip adress on my laptop and connected it on port 1 on the router.</p><p>I read something about aborting the u-boot process and a time window i need to find where i can put the file, but a couldnt find any information about how to do this or how big the time window is.</p><p>I hope you guys can help me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
