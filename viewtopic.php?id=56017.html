					<p>Unfortunately I own this adsl modem + router that at the moment is not supported, but I think that it has some good features witch I&#039;d like to use with openwrt (2 x usb2.0 port, dual band n600 wi-fi). If it is possible I&#039;d like to help with the development... How should I&nbsp; proceed?</p><p>1) First of all I&#039;m asking if my whish to have an openwrt support for Netgear DGND3700v2 is a doable task or if it will remain only a dream;</p><p>2) if it is a doable task, I guess I need a backup of the original firmware + settings so that I can reset if I brick the router (What tool do I need for that?);</p><p>3) Then I think I need some tool to flash openwrt into the DGND3700v2 (What tool do I need for that?);</p><p>4) If I understand correctly, at the moment there is a problem with adsl modem driver,&nbsp; isn&#039;t it?</p><p>5) Who I have to contact in order to collaborate?</p><p>hope to hear some good news... Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s possible OpenWRT for this router. The main problem is the NAND flash, there are drivers under the GPL license but still not ported to OpenWrt.&nbsp; I guess it will eventually supported.</p><p>A backup is always a good idea of course.</p><p>Tool for flashing. I don&#039;t know this particular platform bcm6362, but most bcm63xx based routers comes with a foolprof flashing web interface. In any case a serial console is always very useful for flashing and watching what&#039;s going on.</p><p>ADSL isn&#039;t supported in bcm63xx and never will.</p><p>The best help for this router would be to port the NAND driver to OpenWrt.</p><p>Also the both wifis are integrated/onboard broadcoms, aren&#039;t them?. Not the best support under linux, probably only B/G mode.&nbsp; </p><p>I guess at this point you are thinking it isn&#039;t worth it. Broadcom stuff isn&#039;t GPL friendly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the quick reply, yes actually I&#039;m thinking that I did a bad thing when I bought that piece of hardware if I can&#039;t have ADSL with Openwrt... probably I&#039;ll sell it on ebay and buy something supported by Openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry to revive a post this old, but I found this router at a local Salvation Army for $5. Yes, $5!</p><p>All is working fine with the manufacture firmware, and setup works fine over Comcast. USB storage is detected fine. I have backed up those settings. However, I would love to get OpenWRT on this device. I find the manufacture firmware/interface to be clunky. </p><p>I would love to have openwrt to have ssh access on this device! Any chance this could happen? I don&#039;t care if the ADSL port works or not. The ADSL port is useless to me.&nbsp; I just care about the Lan ports, WAN, and WiFi.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kgoerbig</strong> on 7 Oct 2015, 01:55)</p>
