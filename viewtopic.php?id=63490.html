					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am working on SOM9331 Chaos_calmer firmware and installed the package <em>block-mount</em> for auto mount and un-mount. We have only 1 usb port and when I plug thumb-driver, the device is listing sda1 because of only 1 partition. And I am mounting to /mnt/ and using FTP, user has access to only /mnt/ directory. Now if I upload any files from ftp client (Filezilla) and unplug the thumb-driver , the files are getting uploaded and unmounting is also working perfect.</p><p>But also getting the error <strong>fat-fs (sda1) directory bread(block ) failed</strong> and when I plug thumb-driver, it is listing in /dev/sdb1 instead of sda1. <br />Does anybody have faced similar issues? Can anyone tell me how to fix it?</p><p>Regards,<br />Sowmya</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello eduperez,</p><p>Thank you for the link.<br />I did the way you suggested but in no success. We did few tests and came to know that it is because of the vsdtpd server which is holding the mounting points.</p><p>If there is read / write from ftp client, then unmount and mount, the device is listing in sdb rather than in sda. Even if the ftp client disconnects, we are facing the same issue. Can anyone help us in fixing this issue?</p><p>TIA,<br />Sowmya</p>									</div>

					<p>You should stop accessing the device before un-mounting it; in fact, the un-mounting should fail is there is any active process accessing the filesystem. Have you tried to stop the daemon before un-mounting the device?</p>									</div>
