					<p>@beginner67890 These logging obviously dont work, I tried it before. They run on a too high level. The problem mostly is, when a critical kernel panic occurs, the device cant handle anything with higher drivers anymore, like usb, network, even maybe hdd. There would need to be some logging running on lowest level as possible, like Windows does for a BSOD when it collects data and writes a memory dump to disk. The last important log entries would always be missing in this case. I dont know of any other router I could replace the WRT1200 with sadly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 17 Apr 2018, 02:55)</p>

					<p>makedir-</p><p>My remote log file now has 192K after 10 hours of logging. The logs will get rotated into storage periodically so there will be a lot of information to check. I would expect the memory problems would cause the kernel to complain about bad memory blocks or cause kernel panics before causing a reboot. There are very few things that will cause the kernel to totally lock the entire system. There should be core dumps without a reboot in most cases if core dumps are enabled. I am unsure about that.</p><p>I am sure you have investigated the DDR3 reports so would know if anybody has seen any clues available to confirm the problem in your router. Maybe the chips become unresponsive except what would cause the reboot? There might be a delay when a watchdog takes action so that timing should show in the logs.</p><p>If you are convinced your router has bad DDR3 chips then nevermind my curiosity. I am still unhappy with the tiny little power adapter obviously with switching design to produce the high amperage output and whether that can maintain a valid output during periodic transients. They can occur when motors start and the voltage drops to near zero for a fraction of a second. There could be a combination of nearby washing machines, heat pumps, air compressors all starting at the same time causing the adapter to produce a low output. Then the router would basically get turned off and on again or rebooted.</p><p>Some older power supplies or higher amperage power supplies with bigger capacitors can continue to produce power during the transients so trying some that could be handy with the same voltage and plug instead of the Linksys adapter might eliminate that possibility if you want to keep the WRT1200ACv2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>beginner67890</strong> on 17 Apr 2018, 04:36)</p>

					<p>@beginner67890 The crash/reboots seem to be too critical, it will stop the CPU before a log output can be generated.

					<p>@sandreas83 If you dont have issues like reboots, than you dont need to contact Linksys I guess? I am sure though, that some if not all production line of it has an issue, may it be bad/cheap RAM, not proper cooled RAM or maybe no good power supply. As I see it though, if you just are an ordinary user and just use it literally for nothing, you wont see this happen or at least very rarely. The more processes you run on it, especially which are RAM using and multi treading, it might occur more often. I&#039;m still trying to find out, if stressing the RAM by writing to /tmp might trigger something, but I wasnt lucky so far.</p>									</div>

The problem mostly is, when a critical kernel panic occurs, the device cant handle anything with higher drivers anymore, like usb, network, even maybe hdd. There would need to be some logging running on lowest level as possible, like Windows does for a BSOD when it collects data and writes a memory dump to disk. The last important log entries would always be missing in this case. I dont know of any other router I could replace the WRT1200 with sadly.</p></blockquote></div><p>I agree with your report here. I just unplugged my router power supply trying to be very fast to replug yet took about 5 seconds after fumbling. The remote log gives no indication before the reboot and none after the remote logging resumes.</p><p>I wanted to test if the router would not reboot after a very brief power outage except could not correctly reseat the adapter quick enough. I need to run more tests to see if the router would reboot with less than a second of power interruption.</p><p>Here is a very interesting article about the WRT1900ACS in comparison to the WRT1200ACv1. The circuit board is shown for both routers and show just one tiny capacitor next to the power supply socket. I think a big electrolytic capacitor could be soldered to the power switch leads or just replace the switch and so give a better transient response without making any other changes.</p><p><a href="https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32856-linksys-wrt1900acs-dual-band-gigabit-router-reviewed?limitstart=0">https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireles … mitstart=0</a></p><p>The 12 volt power adapter has a very common plug so should be easy to substitute. Just borrowing an adapter could verify the problem before making a purchase. The adapters can sometimes be found in second-hand stores. A 3 or 4 amp 12 volt supply like a brick would be very good.</p><p>The bigger UPS units can get expensive except just a very small UPS would be sufficient for the power adapters. The smallest size should be fine because 99% of all transients are very short duration and barely make the lights flicker. The UPS units contain a small 12 volt battery and they will die eventually. I just replaced one battery for a 350 watt UPS for $15. Try to borrow a UPS first before making a purchase in case the memory chips are the actual problem or at least choose a place with a good return policy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>beginner67890</strong> on 17 Apr 2018, 19:44)</p>
