					<p>Hello All :<br />We are looking for someone familiar with developing OpenWRT to have a customized openWRT firmware.<br />Please let me know if anyone can do the job or if you know where I should look for it.<br />For regulatory purposes in a country ( Iran ) we need two firmware for Gateworks Avila 2348-4L and ADI engineering pronghorn 210 and 250 which are also the same platform . I will send you the data sheets.<br />Firmware number one :<br />1- a slight change in the GUI appearance. ( I will discuss more in the email )</p><p>Firmware number two :<br />1- same slight change in the GUI appearance as mentioned in number one.<br />2- regulatory domain country to be fixed to Iran. and no other country should be available as an option. So the wireless channels available will only be 5745 to 5825.<br />3- The firmware upgrade option in the software should be removed. <br />4- These changes should not be gone by applying reset factory of course.<br />5- With a secret keyboard combination the upgrade button appear.<br />* How much more will this cost if we want this for another platform ?<br />For budget please contact me.<br />peter.blumstein@excelnetworks,com<br />Thank you</p>									</div>
