					<p>I&#039;ve been hacking around with this box... some differences from the plain G.</p><p>1. Uses mips big-endian mode, so you have to make a new toolchain.&nbsp; Not compatible with Linksys binaries<br />2. Only 4MB Flash!&nbsp; I&#039;ve built a kernel with squashfs and an extra mtd partition for the spare space, but don&#039;t anticipate having more than around 2MB free even if I strip the image bare.&nbsp; btw. their hacked kernel 2.4.18 kernel contains bits of 2.4.19, some CVS directories, all sorts of crap, so it&#039;s difficult to strip out their changes.&nbsp; They also statically link some proprietary stuff into the final kernel (GPL issues???)<br />3. Their kernel has lots of stuff extra like ebtables for bridging... not used by the shipped frontends but could be useful.<br />4. Netgear provide all the tools to create a new image, so there&#039;s no guesswork.&nbsp; If you run their script on a default binary it produces an identical image to the release image, so seems to be OK.</p><p>Some info...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /proc/cpuinfo

					<p>I build an image with squashfs + jffs2, busybox 1.0, etc.&nbsp; seems to work.</p><p>Unfortunately while testing I made the bootloader writeable and managed to write to it..&nbsp; result: brick.&nbsp; It seems the DG834GT has no ROM and if you corrupt the bootloader it can&#039;t flash a new one (the bootloader is what gives you the flashing lights if a firmware upgrade breaks - it&#039;s pretty deep brickage to destroy that).</p><p>At this point I wish JTAG cables were affordable...</p>									</div>

					<p>The GT is a Broadcom 6348 Mips processor, with a Broadcom switch (so its switching function doesn&#039;t use any CPU).&nbsp; It uses an Atheros 108MB wireless card... looks to be a fairly standard one.&nbsp; There&#039;s 16MB of RAM and 4MB of Flash - there&#039;s so much RAM because the drivers take up half of it before the OS has finished booting.&nbsp; The GT looks to be quite a bit faster than the G also.</p><p>From the info on the G it&#039;s similar, just the CPU difference, the broadcom specific stuff in the kernel, and the different wireless card.&nbsp; It *should* be possible to do something like I&#039;ve done with the G, provided the source is available in the same way as for the GT.</p><p>The best thing to so if you&#039;re planning on doing a small conversion like mine is to enable NFS in the kernel and store everything outside the machine while you&#039;re working with it (you can even make it boot off NFS but I wasn&#039;t that brave...).&nbsp; That means you can modify things without having to re-burn an image every time.</p>									</div>
