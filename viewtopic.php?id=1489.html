					<p>Hi all, is there any way how to measure signal and noise levels on WRT54G(S) in dBm? &quot;wl rssi&quot; does not return dBm as far as I know.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t make myself clear. I need to measure signal quality of the AP (or the peer, simply the signal quality of another wireless device) from the client side. As I wrote before &quot;wl rssi&quot; and &quot;wl noise&quot; return something but the numbers are not in dBm thus are incompatible with numbers returned by different brand devices. iwconfig on Linksys does not return these numbers (but e.g. iwconfig on Sharp Zaurus PDA does) and iwspy causes instant reboot of the device (latest experimental release from April and custom built latest CVS too).</p>									</div>

					<p>From the WL documentation (<a href="http://www.jawug.za.net/wl">http://www.jawug.za.net/wl</a>) it appears as if at least the noise is reported in dBm,<br />by the WL utility.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>noise   Get noise (moving average) right after tx in dBm</code></pre></div><p>In my experience, with wl rssi, and wl noise, they correlate very closely, so I&#039;m going to go out on a limb and say that RSSI<br />is probably reported in dBm too.</p><p>Here is the output from one of my WRT&#039;s in client mode, for instance.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@window:~# wl rssi

					<p>Is there a way of measuring noise in (wds) ap mode. I get different readings on different ap&#039;s (different locations). for example on one ap I get noise is -24 on second -37 ? any ideas please, can the real level be atleas calculated from this value ? I mean is this -24 or -37 in some way real (accurate) value or is &quot;totally taken from air&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />?</p>									</div>

					<p>afaict the values for &#039;wl noise&#039; in wds mode are completely bogus.</p><p>as an example do &#039;wl noise&#039; and it will say -37 or so, constantly.</p><p>then do a couple site scans, it will suddenly jump to -97 and stay there.</p><p>not sure wtf is up with that.</p>									</div>
