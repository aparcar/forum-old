					<p>I was wondering this myself.&nbsp; For something the wiki says MUST be done I find it puzzling that there is no explanation as to why.</p><p>I tried using ad-hoc with DD-Wrt and it did not work at all.&nbsp; I then tried with Sveasoft and it barely worked, e.g. 95% packet loss.&nbsp; Then along came open-wrt.&nbsp; Ad-hoc works pretty good, very little packet loss, but I find that pings that should take 1 to 3 milliseconds can take anywhere up to a minute or more to come back.&nbsp; This happens whether the wifi is bridged with vlan0 or not, and with routers that are no more than a foot apart so low signal strength or interference is unlikely.&nbsp; I can ping 100% and with no delays an old linksys wireless ethernet bridge in ad-hoc mode from my laptop, so I know that this issue is definitely confined to the routers.&nbsp; The same routers are rock solid in ap/client configuration, so I have no reason to suspect the hardware.</p><p>What is it about ad-hoc mode that makes it so flaky on the 54g?<br/>Is this a kernel driver issue or some other software?</p>									</div>

					<p>ad-hoc mode does not support bridging natively. it&#039;s not a kernel issue, it&#039;s an 802.11 limitation. Ad-hoc also does not &#039;link&#039; with it&#039;s peers, and therefore will not show a link status. It will however show the cell it belongs to, and if both peers belong with the same cell, and channel they will communicate Ok. However, I believe it encourages bad network design. Take the time to learn how to route. You will reap the rewards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Driven,<br/>might not help you, but I was finding bad performance with Freifunk (had been changing all the settings :-) and whatever I set would not improve it..... in the end I did a factory reset and it magically started working.</p><p>Tip is to factory reset and change minimum of settings.<br/>Simon</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still looking for the answer.... it appears that noboby know why briding WLAN and LAN causes a slow connection on WiFi when using Ad-Hoc.</p><p>If you do know please post.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Simon.</p>									</div>

					<p>Still no answer... :-(</p><p>I think it&#039;s just because the little processor can&#039;t cope with running a bridge in software, not enough MIPs. However I have found another solution which does not require a bridge, subnetting the hell out of it.</p><p>Details are here (if anyone is interested):<br/><a href="http://wordpress.calgarymesh.ca/2006/12/13/burn-your-bridges-in-friefunk/">http://wordpress.calgarymesh.ca/2006/12 â€¦ -friefunk/</a></p><p>Simon.</p>									</div>
