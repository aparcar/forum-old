					<p>Reading the wiki sometimes helps :</p><p><a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing</a></p><p>and read the paragraph called squashfs vs jffs2</p><p>Finally, remember that squashfs potentially and usually allows more free space to install software.</p>									</div>
