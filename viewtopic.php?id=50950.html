					<p>Hello All,</p><p>Recently me and a colleague of mine are trying to setup a VXLAN based solution in our network and decided to test it on openwrt, since the batest BB uses kernel &gt; 3.8.</p><p>However, we are facing the issue described in TT#16681<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16681">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16681</a></p><p>Seems like the vxlan support is not added in the build tree, then it cannot be built into the image I am trying to compile.</p><p>Can we expect vxlan support to be merged into the latest kernel in trunk or we have to add it separately. If so, can you give me some guidelines how to intergrate it into the kernel or as a separate kmod module in my build environment.</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dir2cas</strong> on 5 Jun 2014, 18:22)</p>

					<p>Issue is resolved. I enabled VXLAN support into the kernel template of my build environment and successfully built an image having ip-full package integrated in it, but now with vxlan-enabled kernel.</p><p>Now the vxlan virtual interfaces can be manipulated through the iproute2 CLI.</p><p>I think that the TT can also be closed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dir2cas</strong> on 5 Jun 2014, 18:23)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I`d like to know if VXLAN links were successfully implemented on OpenWRT after that. If that is the case, how can I enabled VXLAN support into the kernel template? I mean, which file should I modify, or in which part of the menuconfig should I enable VXLAN support?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
