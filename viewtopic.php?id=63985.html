					<p>Hello, <br />I have an Archer C5 v1.2 running Open WRT CC 15.05. After getting this router, one of the first things I had a look at was IPv6. <br />My ISP has IPv6 with PD and the prefix 2a00:c1a0/32. After the initial setup everything worked for 2-3 days without a flaw. Then I wasn&#039;t able to reach sites by IPv6. My PC had an assigend IPv6 from the router and everything seemed like before except that I couldn&#039;t reach the Internet by IPv6. After restarting the wan6 interface in LUCI I recognized that I got a new external IPv6 and everything was working again like a charm.<br />After 2,5 additional days the same thing happened, Everything looked fine but no IPv6 connection to the outside. The router showed the same external IPv6, my PC had an address but no IPv6 internet. Restarting the wan6 interface, new external IPv6, everything working again...<br />This is a little bit annoying and I don&#039;t know where to look. I didn&#039;t change any IPv6 things on the router because it worked &quot;out of the box&quot; (but lasts only 2,5 days ;-))</p><p>Some help?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>schossel</strong> on 6 Apr 2016, 20:25)</p>
