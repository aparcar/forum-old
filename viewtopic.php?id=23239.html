					<p>I have a WL-520GU flashed with brcm-2.4 8.09.2 (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2/brcm-2.4/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 â€¦ uashfs.trx</a>).&nbsp; The WLAN (Air) LED does not work correctly when the WLAN is enabled, it will sometimes light up very dimly and sometimes not light up at all.&nbsp; The WLAN LED works correctly with DD-WRT and Tomato.&nbsp; I have searched Google, the forums, and the wiki for hints, but I haven&#039;t been able to find a solution (although this issue seems to have been mentioned before).</p><p>I have tried:<br />- Flashing Tomato -&gt; reset to defaults -&gt; Flashing OpenWRT (dim LED)<br />- Flashing DD-WRT -&gt; reset to defaults -&gt; Flashing OpenWRT (dim LED)<br />- Flashing OpenWRT -&gt; `mtd -r erase nvram` (erased the nvram as a last ditch effort) -&gt; Reboot (dim LED or no LED at all)</p><p>Note that the LED will correctly blink when it is in the &#039;dim&#039; state.&nbsp; I can fully control the WLAN LED with the /proc/ filesystem only when WLAN is disabled (it almost seems like there is some sort of conflict, although I haven&#039;t been able to find it).</p><p>There also seems to be some sort of weird issue where all the network interfaces (vlans, bridges, physical interfaces) all have the exact same MAC address.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried manually editing the nvram variables related to these addresses, but they don&#039;t seem to be used by Open-WRT (even after manually running `firstboot`).&nbsp; DD-WRT and Tomato both obtain the correct MAC addresses for the interfaces, but it seems OpenWRT likes to use the LAN&#039;s MAC address for all the interfaces.</p>									</div>
