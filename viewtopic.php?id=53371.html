					<p>Hi !<br />I would like to find a router that can serve more than 50 wifi users simultaneously, but I can&#039;t find much information online. How would you find such a chip/model ? Is there any reference web page for this kind of information ?</p><p>Or if anyone has done some testing on few routers, please share <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Or maybe this information is in open-wrt code ? If so, can anyone guide me to where it is ?</p><p>Thanks in advance !</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK there are no restrictions in the chips of the routers, which will block after a certain amount of users.</p><p>However the limitation could be the router&#039;s CPU, which in theory could have a limit before not being able to process its functions.</p><p>Thought you should consider speed an issue. Speed is already halfed being half-duplex, and if every user did generate traffic all the time, the speed would be halfed further per each user associated. <br />A little calculation I learned from somewhere else<br />300Mbit raw network speed = 150Mbit realistic optimal Wifi bandwidth<br />150Mbit divded the amount of users with traffic (users can be associated not doing any traffic load) = actual theoretic speed available per user. So in your case with 50 users worst case would equal to 3Mbit available per user.</p><p>So suggestion would be to divide the load over multiple routers (multiple radios), so everyone experience better throughput. But it depends on the activity.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bjoeg</strong> on 15 Oct 2014, 20:38)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the quick reply.<br />I was aware of the fact that speed would be greatly reduced as number of users grow.<br />I thought that a unit with 4 radios should be best.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not aware of anything with 4 radios that&#039;s not a custom build, but there is no reason that you need 4 radios.</p>									</div>

					<p>NETGEAR routers can accommodate up to 32 clients per wireless band.

					<p>As it&#039;s already been mentioned here, a router with a decent CPU and RAM would be the biggest factors with this many clients.</p><p>The use of the 5Ghz band would also be in your favor since it is much less likely to be congested, so a dual-band solution is a good idea. </p><p>It sounds like you are planning on an all-in-one approach, you should be able to get by with a 400Mhz CPU and 32MB of RAM. However, if you&#039;re planning to have multiple VLANs/subnets and many services (VPN,DNS,UPNP,DHCP...) I would strongly advise doubling down for something with at least 64MB of RAM.</p>									</div>
