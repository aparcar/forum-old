					<p>So as the title suggests, I have locked myself out of the router. </p><p>Using Kamikaze 7.09 on the 2.6 Kernal with X-wrt&#039;s web^if installed, I changed LAN and WAN settings. I left the lan at it&#039;s default of DCHP with a bridged connection. I then changed it&#039;s fallback IP from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.15. Always on subnet 255.255.255.0. I changed the WAN to be set at static 192.168.1.14 with a subnet of 255.255.255.0 I did a soft reboot, followed by a power cycle. <br />I changed my TCP/IP to static with an ip of 30. Subnet per usual. I set the gateway to 192.168.1.15, restarted network services, and plugged the cat5 into the LAN of the router.</p><p>None of the LAN ports respond. I can send all the informatrion I want to&nbsp; them and them will accept it as a live connection. But it&#039;s like everything is directed to dev/null. No response to ping, SSH, port 80. Nothing. It just sits there. never times out. Just keeps sucking down information. A glance at the Gnome connection graph shows 500k sent in 5 minutes and 1.5k responded. Nothing but keep-alive packets I assume.</p><p>Ok, so I change my gateway to 14 instead of 15 and restarted network services. Power cycle the router and plug the cat5 in the WAN instead. Now I can ping!......but that&#039;s all. Port 80, 21, and 22 refuse connections,as any good WAN port on a router with firewall would.</p><p>Am I left with nothing but plugging in a serial console cable and flashing the router new via TFTP? It&#039;s the WGT634U, so reset button does nothing but produce an excellent epic fail by ensuring the need to open the router and flash via serial connection.</p><p>So to summerize since this is in How/TO for a reason. When all you have is the firewalled WAN port, is their a backdoor into the web config or the commend line?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Arch13</strong> on 7 Mar 2008, 16:52)</p>

					<p>Yes.&nbsp; The backdoor is to use failsafe or a serial cable or reflash.</p><p>Your LAN and WAN are on separate layer 2 networks, so you can&#039;t have them on the same subnet.</p><p>BTW, thanks for the &quot;HOWTO lock yourself out of your router&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
