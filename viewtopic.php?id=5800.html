					<p>When I read the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WHR-G54S">Supported</a> comment for this Buffalo WHR-54GS router, it says that the factory default Buffalo firmware loader expects an encrypted firmware with a filename ended with a .ENC extension instead of the standard .bin or .trx. Therefore, it is not possible to directly upgrade this router with any openWRT firmware through the factory firmware GUI. That said, can anyone please tell me what encryption algorithm is used by the factory default firmware so that we can try to encrypt the OpenWRT firmware and upload to the router through the GUI?</p>									</div>

					<p>No way of replacing original firmware with openwrt, don&#039;t know what kind of encryption is applied but you don&#039;t mind about it, just unplug cable power, plug it on again and flash your ap using tftp, very simple and clean solutions; boot_wait is enabled by default.<br />had these routers working without troubles but please use tftp for your first openwrt and never touch boot_wait parameter on nvram, it can save you from a wrong firmware everytime you change your image</p><p>Andrea (Ben) Benini</p>									</div>
