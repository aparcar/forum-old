When I power up the system, it reboots half the times right after decompressing the Kernel. Once it reboots, it remains in an &#039;infinite&#039; reboot loop. Only after a power-cycle there&#039;s a 1 in 2 chance it boots normally again.</p><p>It occurs to me as a hardware initialization error, yet at the same time I&#039;m wondering what hardware could be initialized that early besides memory. To learn more, I would like to build the Kernel separately, but &#039;make world&#039; takes a little bit too long. And &#039;ARCH=x86 CROSS_COMPILE=~/src/openwrt/staging_dir/toolchain-i386_gcc-4.8-linaro_eglibc-2.17/bin/i486-openwrt-linux-gnu- make -j8&#039; in the build directory produces a Kernel double the size.</p><p>Oh, and by the way; The previous Kernel we used, 3.4.112, works and has always worked beautifully.</p>									</div>

The cause of that problem is also found: The Kernel was trying to update the CPU&#039;s MicroCode, without any MicroCode actually built in or in initrd. There&#039;s definitely some checking missing in the code there, but since the function responsible is called with the 32th instruction in .../arch/x86/kernel/head_32.S, debugging is a bit too cumbersome to figure out the exact error mode. Disabling CONFIG_MICROCODE all together cured the problem. However; Other suggestions are most welcome.</p>									</div>
