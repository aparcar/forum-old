					<p>According to wiki current supported firmware for WHR-G125 is 10.03.01, Which is..... old <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ve been running old dd-wrt firmware on this router for Years and someone in DD-WRT forum told me that I can use lated generic Broadcom firmware release on this router, and I did, and it works great. Is some thing similar possible with openwrt as well. Can I install some generic Broadcom build on this router? According to wiki recommended firmware includes brcm-2.4. But no release after 10.03 includes that directory.</p><p>Any suggestion on the latest firmware for this router?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nskware</strong> on 28 Aug 2016, 23:15)</p>

					<p>I think the issue is the memory which is not enough for newer firmwares especially if you run LUCI. Probably tomato would be a better choice for this particular router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I find it hard to believe that memory size is the issue as I can load latest generic standard broadcom dd-wrt release from last week without any issues. Also openwrt is suppose to be much more modular. Also I do not really care about WiFi part of this router as I just use it as gateway with another router as an AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it&#039;s a combination of both size of ram and flash size (only 4MB). Most openwrt images have sizes near 8MB these days unless you trim a lot of &quot;fat&quot; from them. If the router had USB you can go them the extroot way and have fs on USB flash but that is not possible here. <br />Also you&#039;ve mentioned brcm-24 - that&#039;s another reason as no-none really wants to support 2.4 kernel any more. I believe this router actually can run 2.6 kernel as well which I believe tomato does. </p><p>Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like this router at one point I&#039;ve bought and ran 3 of WHR-G125 initially with dd-wrt and later switching to tomato <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> But it&#039;s finally showing it&#039;s age so I have gradually replaced them with newer hardware. Still have one sitting on my shelf and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find good use for it. It&#039;s definitely great as a spare or as a travel router given its size.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dziny</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 17:24)</p>
