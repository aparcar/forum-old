					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently bought a linux based el cheapo 3g router from DealExtreme and am quite happy with it:</p><p><a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/portable-wireless-n-3g-router-cdma2000-evdo-td-scdma-hspa-wcdma-45639">http://www.dealextreme.com/p/portable-w … cdma-45639</a></p><p>Not bad for 32 USD. It does all I want but unfortunately it does not work with a ZTE MF-668 3g dongle.<br />I managed to get this dongle working on Mint linux and realised that if I have access to my router, I could add support for it too (installing usb_mode switch etc).</p><p>So I searched Google and found out that in August, OpenWrt developer(s) to my joy added support for this device.</p><p>The post is here:</p><p><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2011-August/011930.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 11930.html</a></p><p>But when I look in the list of supported hardware, it is not there?<br />So my question is: is this device supported and if not officially, what do I need to do to try it out?</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wcool</strong> on 5 Jan 2012, 21:30)</p>
