					<p>After i have setup 1 TP-Link WR1043ND as AP and 4 TP-Link WR1043ND as client, partially with an additional AP, I would like to know, if I can use an AVM Fritzbox 7270 with stock fw as AP and all the WR1043ND as clients? Encryption must be WPA2-CCMP. Generally I did the same as with the WR1043ND, but the FB 7270 didn&#039;t recognize the WR1043ND correctly as WDS-clients.</p><p>Before I change a working system, I would like to know, if anyone has this working. AVM says WPA2 works with AVM-products only.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have one Fritz 7113 working as AP, and the TP-link I am trying to make a client (WDS). I can make WR1043ND a client, but when I set it to Client (WDS): the Fritz can not find WR1043ND in the repeater section. I don&#039;t know why. But I do see that WR1043ND is connected to Fritz wirelessly.</p><p>[This could be because the WR1043ND controller doesn&#039;t support repeater mode (?): <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a> : &quot;On MAC80211 OpenWRT use 4 address (option wds 1) (with ap or sta mode) and not repeater mode.&quot;]</p><p>Also, under Client (WDS) I can not access Luci. I have to telnet through UTP cable, disable wifi, and then I can access Luci. Don&#039;t know why this is eather....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davor</strong> on 3 Jul 2012, 12:43)</p>
