					<p>Hi everybody!</p><p>It&#039;s possible to know when the WRT54GL is transmitting or receiving by hardware?</p><p>I mean, is there any pin on the WRT54GL board which acts as a trigger indicating when the access point is transmitting or receiving?</p><p>I have a counter integrated in a chip which counts CLK cycles and I want to use it to count the CLK cycles the access point need starting at a RTS is received (from an WLAN adapter) and the corresponding CTS is sent (from the access point).</p><br /><p>Thanks a lot,</p><p>Alfonso.</p>									</div>
