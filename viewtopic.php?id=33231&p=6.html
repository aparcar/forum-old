					<p>You will probably need to solder in a serial connection in order to unbrick it. If you follow my annoyingly verbose series of pictures/comments a few pages back ( starting here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=229422#p229422">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 22#p229422</a>&nbsp; and summarised here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=232750#p232750">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 50#p232750</a> ), it is fairly easily doable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lobonse</strong> on 20 Nov 2016, 19:32)</p>

Find the DIR-601 B1 row and click the View/Edit Data link. At the bottom, you&#039;ll see the Firmware OpenWrt Install URL. Unfortunately, to use the Stock firmware to flash you need the NA build. Copy the URL and paste it into your browser. Replace &quot;factory.bin&quot; with &quot;factory-NA.bin&quot;. (NOTE: I had already flashed with a version that did not include Luci, thus I used the &quot;sysupgrade.bin&quot;.) I am trying to set it up as a Routed Client now, I may need to install relayd. Haven&#039;t done exhaustive tests but it looks great so far. Thanks everyone!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>miesch1</strong> on 21 Dec 2017, 07:59)</p>
