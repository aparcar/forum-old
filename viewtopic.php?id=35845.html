					<p>Yes it&#039;s possible and it&#039;s great!</p><p>1. First make sure you have full working USB support: install these packages (on the device)<br />kmod-usb-storage<br />block-mount<br />block-hotplug<br />kmod-fs-ext2</p><p>2. prepare an USB stick by formating it with an ext2 filesystem - you won&#039;t be able to do this from the router itself (installing the filesystem tools packages takes too much space), either:<br />a) do it from Windows with various tools, for example: EASEUS Partition Master 9<br />b) do it from some other Linux with: mke2fs /dev/&lt;usb device&gt;</p><p>3. plug the stick in the router and mount it:<br />mount -t ext2 /dev/&lt;usb device&gt; /mnt/usb/<br />&lt;usb device&gt; usually it&#039;s sda1<br />/mnt/usb must be first created with mkdir, or you can use /mnt directly - from now on i&#039;ll assume /mnt/usb/ was used</p><p>4. prepare opkg for external installs<br />edit /etc/opkg.conf and add an extra line that maps the destination &quot;usb&quot; to the path where you mounted the stick<br />dest usb /mnt/usb/</p><p>5. prepare the extra paths for executables and libraries:<br />export USB=/mnt/usb<br />export PATH=$PATH:$USB/usr/bin:$USB/usr/sbin<br />export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$USB/lib:$USB/usr/lib</p><p>6. install whatever you want on the external storage with:<br />opkg install &lt;package&gt; -d usb</p><p>so &quot;-d usb&quot; is the key, make sure you don&#039;t forget it otherwise packages will be installed in the router storage itself and will quickly fill it up leading to corruption!</p><p>NOTES:<br />* you will want to automate steps 3 and 5 somehow otherwise on the next reboot it won&#039;t work and you&#039;ll have to run them again<br />for #5 edit /etc/profile and add the variables there</p><p>* some programs need additional config files to run, you will have to create links between the root filesystem and the usb one<br />for example for successfully running Midnight Commander after installing it on usb run:<br />ln -s $USB/usr/share/terminfo/ /usb/share/<br />ln -s $USB/etc/mc /etc/mc</p><p>Enjoy!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>valentingalea</strong> on 1 Apr 2012, 12:33)</p>

					<p>hi, everybody, <br />I&#039;ve just seen these posts and I&#039;m wondering which &quot;strategy&quot; to adopt regarding the &quot;right way for doing&quot; Flash File extension. </p><p>I explain : <br />I was also disapointed by the amount of on board FLASH and decided to switch it to an external (recycled) Ext4 64Mb USB pen drive. </p><p>On board 4Mo are really too small and I even had to first remove few packages before being able to start pivoting the overlay (the USB packages are really hungry <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I followed the Extroot howto and every thing runs well ! <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a></p><p>The purpose seems to be more or less equivalent for what I can name : &quot;user space extension &quot; but i&#039;m sure there are other counterparts I haven&#039;t identified.<br />So, this leads me to ask myself&nbsp; and you guys if I did well and if it can&#039;t be somewhat dangerous e.g. to much W/R access(?)</p><p>Appart from the fact that once I&#039;ve pivoted the overlay i don&#039;t need to bother with opkg destination extension and PATH exports, what else&nbsp; may be taken into account for a box that should run some CRON&#039;ed scripts and acts as a datalogger (Sqlite3 cli) with mutliwan connection (Eth +3G backup) for&nbsp; downloading the database dump daily ? </p><p>thanks for any hints you may provide <br />Eric</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RicoCoco</strong> on 29 Jun 2012, 16:48)</p>
