					<p>Currently I&#039;m using a WRT54GL with the X-wrt firmware (but I&#039;m happy to use either Open or X-wrt), however the WAN port uses an RJ45 connector and my ADSL socket uses an RJ11. Currently I&#039;ve solved this by using a DG834GT in modem mode to bridge between my ISP and the WRT, however I&#039;m hoping to replace this with a single box and I was wondering if OpenWRT supports any router-modems with an RJ11 port and if I can use ETHoA directly?</p><p>My ISP uses the following settings.</p><p>Encapsulation : LLC<br />VPI : 0<br />VCI : 101<br />MTU: 1500</p><p>I also have a Static IP.</p><p>P.S. I&#039;ve also heard ETHoA refered to as &quot;Routed Ethernet over ATM&quot; and &quot;1483 Briged connection&quot;</p><p>[edit]Now I think of it, what would happen if I get a wire with an RJ45 on one end and a RJ11 on the other? would that work?</p>									</div>

That&#039;s the purpose of the different connectors - to physically isolate different hardware interfaces. RJ45 interconnects Ethernet networks (which run 12V DC) and RJ11 connects consumer devices (phones, fax machines, modems etc.) to PSTN (POTS) networks (operating on about 48V). So that&#039;s the purpose of the modem (MOdulator/DEModulator) - to &quot;translate&quot; the Ethernet protocol (coming from the RJ45 interface of the modem) in form suitable to be distributed over the telephone network (ADSL for example) via the RJ11 interface.</p><br /><p>Regards,<br />Zdravko</p>									</div>

					<p>Pity, that would have made it nice and easy. </p><p>So if I can&#039;t do that, anyone know of any nice router/modems supported by OpenWRT?</p>									</div>
