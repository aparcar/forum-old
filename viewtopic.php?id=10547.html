					<p>First of all I would like to thank all of the developers for taking the time to provide such a valuable project.</p><p>I am having a weird problem with the date on my Buffalo router running WhiteRussian 0.9.&nbsp; The timezone is set according to the documentation to &#039;EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0&#039; as set in /etc/TZ.&nbsp; When I type &#039;date&#039; I get the correct output, eg: &#039;Mon Apr 30 15:56:30 EDT 2007&#039;.&nbsp; When I type &#039;date -R&#039; I get something I didn&#039;t expect, eg: &#039;Mon, 30 Apr 2007 15:56:30 +0400&#039;.&nbsp; Note that the timezone is &#039;+0400&#039; and not &#039;-0400&#039;.&nbsp; This wouldn&#039;t be such a problem, except that I am using ssmtp to send status emails to myself and they are all timestamped 8 hours off.</p><p>If this provides any additional insight, I am using ntpclient to keep the time correct since the router drifts a bit.&nbsp; I use the cron command &#039;ntpclient -c 1 -s -h `nvram get ntp_server`&#039; to set the time once a day (as suggested in the documentation).&nbsp; I cannot see where the problem lies.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p><p>TIA!!</p><br /><p>-- Harry O.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like this is expected behavior, the -R parameter outputs date and time in RFC 2822 format, more info on that here:</p><p><a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html</a></p><p>Section 3.3 holds the key:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The zone specifies the offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, formerly referred to as &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot;) that the date and time-of-day represent.&nbsp; The &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; indicates whether the time-of-day is ahead of (i.e., east of) or behind (i.e., west of) Universal Time.&nbsp; The first two digits indicate the number of hours difference from Universal Time, and the last two digits indicate the number of minutes difference from Universal Time.&nbsp; (Hence, +hhmm means +(hh * 60 + mm) minutes, and -hhmm means -(hh * 60 + mm) minutes).&nbsp; The form &quot;+0000&quot; SHOULD be used to indicate a time zone at Universal Time.&nbsp; Though &quot;-0000&quot; also indicates Universal Time, it is used to indicate that the time was generated on a system that may be in a local time zone other than Universal Time and therefore indicates that the date-time contains no information about the local time zone.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>Harry, after years of looking at email headers EST (-0500) and EDT (-0400) are second nature.&nbsp; +0400 is somewhere in the middle east so I saw your point immediately.</p><p>It&#039;s not the extra correction string, either.&nbsp; I set to straight &quot;EST5EDT&quot; and -R continues to output +0400.</p>									</div>

					<p>For the record, my brain hurts every time I have to read RFCs...&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>OK, I&#039;ve read through that paragraph a few more times, and it&#039;s slowly sinking in.&nbsp; Say it is 11am UTC.&nbsp; Eastern time is 5 hours earlier (-0500), and the east coast of the US is also west of UTC.&nbsp; So, the negative value is correct for EST.&nbsp; So, the RFC matches what we&#039;ve all come to read in email headers.</p><p>So, this leads us back to this being a bug in busybox.&nbsp; I&#039;m running busybox 1.4.0-1 here, and I&#039;m seeing the same issue, so I do agree that this is definitely a bug in the date command showing a positive value instead of a negative one.</p>									</div>

					<p>The uClibc package will have the increased release number (10).<br />I think that updating the library would have the same effects like updating the busybox. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I would not recommend it therefore.</p>									</div>
