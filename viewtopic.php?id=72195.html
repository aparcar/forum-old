					<p>Hello! Does anyone know if it&#039;s possible to flash Intel Compute Stick with OpenWRT? And if it&#039;s so how should i do it?</p><p>Intel Compute Stick supports only EFI booting, so I tried the instruction for &quot;Minnowboard Max&quot; flashing (from OpenWRT website) and it didn&#039;t help. After flashing Intel Compute Stick with help of this instruction it doesn&#039;t responding on any command and screen becomes frozen on the last picture (but after turning it off I can boot from live usb with Ubuntu). I think that control flow is passing to the OpenWRT vmlinuz and then something goes wrong</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anton_13</strong> on 30 Sep 2017, 16:15)</p>

Thanks for your reply.<br />In &quot;<em>Minnowboard Max</em>&quot; flashing instruction (from official OpenWRT wiki) is written that we can build kernel with <em>EFI stub booting</em> support. Minnowboard Max is device which supports only EFI booting too. Because of it I decided that it is possible to adapt this instruction for me. But something goes bad.<br />I did this things:<br />1) I built the kernel with special options: <em>Symmetric Multi Processing support</em>, <em>EFI runtime service support</em>, <em>EFI stub support</em> and <em>EFI Variable Support via sysfs</em>.<br />2) Made a <em>GPT</em> partition table.<br />3) Made a EFI (with fat32 file system) and the main partition (with EXT4 file system).<br />4) Copied vmlinuz to /EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi.<br />5) Unpacked openwrt-x86-64-generic-rootfs.tar.gz to main partition.<br />6) Saved &quot;fs0:\EFI\BOOT\bootx64.efi root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 noinitrd&quot; script to startup.nsh.<br />What am I doing wrong?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anton_13</strong> on 2 Oct 2017, 13:08)</p>

					<p>Hello, we have made to boot OpenWRT on Intel Stick with Atom x5 but we able to boot from USB Flash Drive via Build-in EFI shell command line. But after it booted - it only sees sda and no eMMC - we are trying to solve this issue now.</p><p>@anton_13 It&#039;s 2018 now and may be have made it work?</p>									</div>

					<p>Solved. The required kernel build options was: CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_ACPI and CONFIG_X86_INTEL_LPSS<br />BUT, to build them into kernel it was required to add them into target/linux/x86/64/config-default file so it won&#039;t be overwritten by other kernel .config files (there are several of them)</p>									</div>
