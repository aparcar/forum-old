					<p>Hi.<br />I was able to run coovachilli in a GL-AR300M using the example configuration in the wiki (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wireless.hotspot.coova-chilli">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wire … ova-chilli</a>)&nbsp; I&#039;ve just changed the hotspot system configurations to use an external server for the captive portal.<br />For the captive portal I&#039;ve used the example script provided by cloudtrax (<a href="https://help.cloudtrax.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202715620/splash.php">https://help.cloudtrax.com/hc/en-us/art … splash.php</a>)</p><p>Regarding freeradius, I&#039;ve just installed it in ubuntu and created a default user and pass using this guide (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/CoovaChilli">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/CoovaChilli</a>)</p><p>Now I need to know how I can limit the bandwitdth and connection time of each client, I just need to provide 30min connection at speeds up to 2mbps.<br />I know this can be done by enabling an accounting module of the freeradius, but how I can do this and also how the configurations of the coovachilli file inside the router would change?</p><p>Any guidance is really appreaciated as the documentation of coovachilli is not quite clear and the project seems to be abandoned.<br />Thanks!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>You should ask on a freearadius forum. However, you will find a lot of info just by googling. Because almost nothing special to do on freeradius when used for coova-chilli. <br />In coova, only to configure the 2 radius servers (can be identical, of course).<br />coova project is not abandoned; however, besides some glitches in special configs (i.e. using the kmod), it simply works. <br />I used it several times in commercial hotspot projects.<br />Regarding &quot;docs not clear&quot;, you are absolutely correct. <br />In other posts here, I wrote already, it certainly helps reading and understaning the C-code :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>augustus_meyer</strong> on 5 Sep 2017, 14:07)</p>
