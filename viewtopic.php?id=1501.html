					<p>hi, i&#039;ve a problem with copying large files from USB-stick on my WL-500G.<br />First I though this is an usb-driver problem, but then I copied some files to the ram-disk (/tmp) and started<br />the httpd -h /tmp and tried to wget the file on the remote-machine. Mostly this fails, after 1-5 MB copied the transmission stops. No erro-messages, evan dmesg on the router doesn&#039;t show any erro-massage.<br />The same happens if I scp large files from the router, so it is not an problem of the busybox build in httpd.</p><p>I also tried to cat some files&nbsp; (about 20 mp3 files - approx. 80MB ) to /dev/null after short time this happens:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/mnt# cat * &gt;&gt; /dev/null 
Segmentation fault
root@OpenWrt:/mnt#</code></pre></div><p>now I re-compile busybox with debug information - but I think it could be an Kernel problem, because with the pached ausus-firmware from oleg (<a href="http://wl500g.dyndns.org">http://wl500g.dyndns.org</a>) every thing works fine.</p>									</div>
