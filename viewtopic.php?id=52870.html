					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to understand how the Inter-Zone Forwarding and zones output policy work. If Inter-Zone Forwarding is configured between zone Lan and zone Wan, why doesn&#039;t the output policy of the Lan zone have any effect? Considering this quote from luci &quot;The input and output options set the default policies for traffic entering and leaving this zone [...]&quot;, shouldn&#039;t the output policy be involved once data leaves the Lan zone to Wan? I thought that the output policy would set the default action for communication between zones that can later be override by rules, eg. whitelisting.</p>									</div>
