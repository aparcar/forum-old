					<p>Strange problem on documentation wiki. Using both FireFox versions 1.5.0.6 and 2.0b2 the link to the documentation for WhiteRussian RC5 results in a blank white page.

					<p>samitro:</p><p>Thanks</p><p>OK, shift+refresh got that page back ... what&#039;s going on? </p><p>I also found that if I cleared the cache before clicking the WhiteRussian link it would work.</p><p>So far I&#039;ve tried it from 2 separate PCs running FireFox, 1 XP and the other Win2000. In addition to the previously mentioned versions of FireFox I also tried the latest FireFox &quot;MineField&quot; beta 3.0a. All of them act the same. Can see it on first click, but subsequent visits show only blank page. Funny thing is that it happens on the link to WhiteRussian, and I think the FAQ link too, but not on the other links on that page.</p><p>I though FireFox was supposed to adhere to Web specs better than IE ... I wonder if the problem is in FF&#039;s rendering or the Wiki&#039;s code?</p><p>Thanks, Cla.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>clabrown</strong> on 20 Sep 2006, 00:42)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t think this has anything to do with openwrt firmware. I have a WRT54GS v3 on DDWRT v23 SP2 router and also experience this issue and to make it worst the issue also creeps into the Internet Explorer (FF on my OpenSuSE-10.1 machine behaves normally). This problem has been taunting me since I installed Firefox. Although a recent firmware upgrade to DDWRT v23 SP2 seems to elevate the problem, my FF and IE still show some emptied pages, especially tring to access the webmenu of my DDWRT v23 SP2 pages. Emptied pages on visiting any openwrt (wiki) sites seemed to be of no problem at the moment; however, I do anticipate this problem will be back to taint my ability to browse. I hope there are experts here who can provide information to resolove this problem once and for all.</p>									</div>
