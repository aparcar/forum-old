					<p>Hello, </p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND V3 here, which I can enter in failsafe-mode.</p><p>(got it for free, because the former owner installed (successfully) gargoyle-firmware (gargoyle_1.9.x-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin), and tried later to change it to openwrt by installing (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin) directly over it (via &quot;update firmware&quot; in the gargoyle GUI). <br />The endresult: not working. </p><p>I have not much experience on Linux but thought I ask here and maybe give it a try.</p><br /><p>When I enter failsafe mode, ssh into it and do firstboot, I get:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@(none):~# firstboot
This will erase all settings and remove any installed packages. Are you sure? [N/y]
y
/dev/mtdblock3 is not mounted
/dev/mtdblock3 will be erased on next mount</code></pre></div><br /><p>If I try to mount rootfs_data, I get the following notice of error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Could not open mtd device: /dev/mtd2
reading rootfs failed
jffs2 not ready yet, using temporary tmpfs overlay
mount failed: No such device, options lowerdir=/,upperdir=/tmp/root/upper,workdir=/tmp/root/work</code></pre></div><br /><p>Is there anything I can do without opening the router/ soldering/ need of a USB TTL cable?<br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Max Hopper, what makes you believe that this might have anything to do with firmware lockdown or region based lock down?</p><p>Let&#039;s check the given facts:<br />- SeltenRot was apparently running gargoyle before installing OpenWrt, given that installing both 3rd party firmwares apparently succeeded (to varying degrees) pretty much proves that FCC-lockdown issues are not at play here.<br />- SeltenRot considers his router to be &quot;(soft-) bricked&quot;, which sounds a bit weird, considering that <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">generic.failsafe</a> is apparently still available, which would contradict the &quot;bricked&quot; part.</p><p>So going on a wild goose chase, I just guess that an trunk snapshot[1] was installed, which -as usual for trunk snapshots (so no bug here, just unexpected behaviour for the enduser)- doesn&#039;t have a webinterface installed, meaning that there&#039;s nothing really configurable via a browser, just via ssh.</p><p>Basically there are two options here, either by configuring the WAN interface (vulgo &quot;the internet connection&quot;) from cli, via ssh, and simply installing luci (the webinterface) via opkg XOR to install a release-firmware (which includes the webinterface) via ssh (this can be done both in normal mode or even from the failsafe environment, by either using sysupgrade or mtd directly).</p><p>[1] the hardware in question, TP-Link TL-WR1043ND <strong>v3</strong>, pretty much confirms this hunch, as it is a rather new hardware revision not previously supported by Chaos Calmer 15.05.x, but only in trunk.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 23:21)</p>

But to get around that probleme and install the stable Chaos Calmer 15.05.1:

    1. Install the trunk version (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin) using the stock web-gui
    2. After restart OpenWRT has been install but the Web-GUI won&#039;t work yet!
    3. Copy the stable ..sysupgrade.bin file to the router e.g. using WinSCP. Give the file a shorter name e.g. sysupg.bin
    4. Now upgrade the router with that image using this command in OpenWRT Linux prompt &quot;sysupgrade -n -F sysupg.bin&quot; again you can use WinSCP or puTTY.</code></pre></div><br /><p>I guess 1.+2. is already done, so .. (3.) where exactly to copy the sysupg.bin? to /tmp?<br />Thanks again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SeltenRot</strong> on 30 Aug 2016, 01:59)</p>

					<p>As mentioned before, it doesn&#039;t look&nbsp; like your device would be bricked at all - you&#039;re just missing the webgui (as normal, for development snapshots), which makes it hard for you to deal with the device (but it&#039;s easy to configure it via cli and/ or to install the webinterface via opkg XOR to install a version including the webgui via sysupgrade or mtd).</p><p>Disclaimer, I don&#039;t know the device in question, but, to the best of my understanding.</p><p>Yes, you can (should) copy it to /tmp/ and sysupgrade from there, as far as I understand it, Chaos Calmer 15.05.x basically already supports your hardware and just misses the information to create a directly flashable factory image (it doesn&#039;t know the new v3 device identifier for the firmware header to be accepted by the original vendor firmware).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 30 Aug 2016, 02:29)</p>

					<p>I spent a little bit more time with it and the device is definitly not bricked.<br />It is just Designated Driver without luCI.</p><p>But I was not able to install luci via &quot;opkg install luci&quot; because the TP-1043WD has no online connection, I have no physical access to the main router, only via wireless. And I am not sure whether the advice for &quot;Minimalistic offline installation&quot; under luCI essentials is up-to-date for my specific case. <br />So I decided to postpone any further action till I can connect the TP-1043ND via lan to go online while reading up here some more about how it is done.</p><p>Thanks a lot for the help though, I really appreciate it.</p>									</div>
