					<p>If you did brick it you will need to either do JTAG or a serial cable to recover it. There really isn&#039;t anything step by step, but there are recovery guides available if you search. Should you still require it, I can tell you what you need to do and what you will need to get a working serial cable to the unit.</p>									</div>
