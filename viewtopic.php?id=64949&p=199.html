With kernel 4.14, the very latest wifi commit, I can use, is from March 5th. There is a patch that work to fix an issue with kernel 4.14, but on the 6th yuhhaurlin does a commit that seems to break the patch. If you remove the patch then all seems to go fine. However, after flashing the image wifi will not work.&nbsp; So, at this point I&#039;m waiting to hear if others are having issues from the daily build and if there is anyone looking to correct the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;&lt; Hope that makes sense.</p></blockquote></div><p>Have you tried making a build with Kernel 4.14 from the wifi commit <a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/commit/b1b9a9e1c1beee30a8cce4038f4109727362ebe0,">https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/commit … 27362ebe0,</a> and also deleting package/kernel/mwlwifi/patches/001-remove-vfs_write.patch?</p><p>Judging by the open pull request at <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/790/commits/4e0482b91cdc9f3027f3b9aef7907db5585c3d1b,">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull … 5585c3d1b,</a> this should work.</p></blockquote></div><p>I pulled/deleted the patch and built kernel 4.14, but experience the issue of 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz not starting.&nbsp; Seems in each SSID there was a bunch of drop downs for frequency, but nothing could be chosen.&nbsp; I tried deleting the wireless config, but that didn&#039;t help either.&nbsp; I was very limited on time, so I just booted back to the other partition and left it at that. </p><p>I haven&#039;t confirmed yet, but wifi seems to work fine if you use the commit from 2/26/2018.</p>									</div>

					<p>It was simply meant to show you what takes place under the sheets.
