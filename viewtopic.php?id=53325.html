					<p>Hey peeps, I am a little bit at a loss with my new OpenWRT router: a NetgearWNDR3800</p><p>I successfully installed OpenWRT on it (the version [http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/ from here]) And I disabled the DHCP, as I already have a modem taking care of this.</p><p>As the router has 4 lan and 1 wan ports, I tried to setup the wan also as a lan port. This might have gone wrong... but...</p><p>The router is behaving very good; Wifi is up, and ethernet ports function, but I can&#039;t find the thing on the network anymore!<br />I did a network scan, and all the devices get listed; phones, appleTV, dekstop, laptop etc. but not the netgear... So I can&#039;t ssh into it or use the webinterface to alter settings</p><p>So. I hope someone has an idea what might be the problem, if a netgear works just fine, but is playing hide and seek with the owner on its own network</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem is most likely that you messed up the lan interface and so it has no address. I suggest that you reset it using the TFTP method and try again. You&#039;ll want to bridge LAN/WAN and set it to get an address from your modem through DHCP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like you did something funny with the network config. It is e.g. possible that you have configured the router to use another subnet (defaul 192.168.1.x) than the one for which your PC gets address via DHCP from the modem.</p><p>Use Open failsafe mode to get access to it, or use Netgear TFTP recovery mode to flash a new firmware and revert to default settings.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#entering.openwrt.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … lsafe.mode</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#recovery.flash.in.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … lsafe.mode</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 13 Oct 2014, 21:08)</p>

					<p>ok, will try that. </p><p>In short (as I tried several things already)<br />1. I reset the modem<br />2. I disable DHCP on the LAN ports<br />3.

After you get that to work, you can then start experimenting with wan settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 13 Oct 2014, 21:21)</p>

					<p>ah, ok! So, my modem/router is 10.13.37.1.<br />Which means I can make the Netgear router 10.13.37.2</p><p>And I set this on the wan port then?</p>									</div>
