					<p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20276">Here</a> is a some old topic that i want to reanimate.<br />At the moment I&#039;m in the pretty same situation as <strong>watts</strong> - need to build some ... bridge? ... between ppp0 and eth0. It is necessary to get a failover 3G-internet on wired routers, like Сisco 8xx or Dlink DFL.</p><p>I have read the topic, but still did not understand:<br /><strong>aport</strong> said: :<em>&quot;Then I assign my laptop the WAN IP and GW from the ppp connection and bam, I&#039;m online.&quot;</em> But i have netmask=255.255.255.255 on ppp0. Do i need to assign that netmask on wan-interface of wired router? And it will work? Or what?</p><p>I have now a small hardware router (not CradlePoint) that does the similar thing - it make a connection to 3G-internet, receive ip and assign that address to the WAN-interface of wired router via pppoe-connection (yes, build-in pppoe-server). But this device VERY unstable, i need to manually restart it EVERY DAY! <br />And i want to try OpenWRT for that.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi! I was working with this quite a while ago so forgive me if I don&#039;t remember the specifics.</p><p>I used the netmask of 255.255.255.255 because that&#039;s the mask that was assigned to my ppp0 device. The point of passthru is to have your ethernet device behave as if it&#039;s the 3g modem, so I would assign it the same network properties your 3g modem gets.</p><p>I would also recommend using iproute2 and the instructions that watts posted: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=96640#p96640">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 640#p96640</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 27 Dec 2013, 00:39)</p>
