					<p>I&#039;m really sorry, but this design... is not really good looking.</p><p>I kind of like the city scape at the bottom (although I have to agree with fallen) but the top part with the &#039;radiowaves&#039; (thought you didn&#039;t want these, mbm <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />) and the colors aren&#039;t that great.<br />In fact, I think the borders are to thick (1 px would be enough) and the black is... well ... too black. Probably you could change it to a dark blue or something.<br />Also the default background color is too blue in my opinion. The very right background color is better (at the color picker).

					<p>pap2boy -<br />This probably isn&#039;t the answer you want to hear, but it&#039;s important to explain a few things:</p><p>Well, the plan was to be past 1.0 by now, the problem really is that WhiteRussian basically forked off and hasn&#039;t kept up to date with development and Kamikaze branch got much further ahead. Apart from the occasional bug fix, not much work has been done on WhiteRussian; most of the developers are running Kamikaze. To make matters worse, several issues were found in the Kamikaze build environment which triggered a rewrite called &quot;buildroot-ng&quot; which fixes the build issues but completely changes the build environment, breaking compatibility and requiring new documentation.</p><p>The whole mess basically means that WhiteRussian isn&#039;t maintained and is quickly falling behind and is arguably already pretty stale. Releasing a stale branch with missing features as an overhyped 1.0 release would be a big mistake, so that leaves us with the task of bringing it back into sync as soon as possible so work can be shared between the branches and get the WhiteRussian branch maintained again. So, that leaves us with the task of merging the newer code from Kamikaze back into WhiteRussian, but that creates another set of problems --</p><p>Kamikaze doesn&#039;t use nvram for configuration, it uses a new config format[1] which means that webif can&#039;t simply be ported, it will have to be rewritten. As a result, that makes it really hard to justify spending much time on the current webif code since now a dead end (which explains why several webif patches have gone ignored). Similar problems exists elsewhere in the WhiteRussian branch.</p><p>So, as explained above, the schedule is:<br />There will be one more release of the current WhiteRussian code called rc6; if that proves stable then it will just be renamed to 0.9. Then work begins on the overhaul, merging the Buildroot-ng environment back into Kamikaze (all that&#039;s left is documenting Buildroot-ng and porting over the packages) and we start merging Kamikaze back into the WhiteRussian branch, this will become the basis for 1.0. We plan to take advantage of a few improvements provided by Buildroot-ng and move packages out of the release and update them much more frequently, at the same time we will enable automatic snapshot builds for those that want to keep up with development.</p><p>As always, we&#039;re looking for help with the project. At this point everything is basically run by 3-6 developers working in their spare time to write code, documentation, maintain the website and provide support and answer trouble tickets. So, progress is understandably slow.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hrmn. It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve visited openwrt.org, so I don&#039;t recall the old design. But I kind of like what it looks like now. Clean, simple, and easy to read. Nice.

					<p>Wow.&nbsp; New layout looks really classy.</p><p>I&#039;ve been using OpenWRT for a while now.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great product which perfectly suits a large number of people, by unlocking the hardware they&#039;ve rightfully purchased and allowing them to use it to its potential.</p><p>Of course, the reason that&#039;s possible is because of the wonderful GPL.&nbsp; It has some drawbacks of course, but when the GPL forces a company to release the sourcecode for its firmware (as Linksys did), it allows hackers and hobbyists to get on with what they do best, makes Linksys a fortune (because we all want their hardware to run OpenWRT), and improves things for everyone involved.</p><br /><p>...which is why I am absolutely shocked at the response to the guy who says his photo is on the front page.&nbsp; If you look at his homepage, you can see that he is obviously a hacker and involved Linux user, who believing in the same principles which have given us the wonders of the WRT, has made his image publically available, free of watermarks or copyright notices, on the one piddly little condition that it be mentioned who made the image in the first place.</p><p>The fact that it was edited and the license terms broken by somebody else don&#039;t change the fact that the original is obviously his and the license is clear.&nbsp; That it now looks much more &#039;generic&#039; is quite true, but also true is that derivative or not, the image on the front page wouldn&#039;t exist if he hadn&#039;t made the original.</p><p>Is it that hard to put a little credit and maybe a link to the license somewhere?&nbsp; These types of license specifically indemnify you from any possible claims of damages or copyright violation as long as you credit the author appropriately.</p><p>If people treated the GPL the way we&#039;ve just treated this guy&#039;s Creative Commons, OpenWRT wouldn&#039;t even exist.</p>									</div>
