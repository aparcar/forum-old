					<p>I&#039;m just getting back into using OpenWRT so please let me know if I&#039;m missing something, but I can&#039;t seem to get DHCP working or maybe the LAN interface isn&#039;t being brought up or what on my Archer C7 v2. I had the stable CC build running well and then decided to give your build a shot since I wanted adblocking and I like to be on the bleeding edge.</p><p>I tried both r49005 and r48933 full images, they both load and flash correctly, then reboot, but after the reboot only the LAN and power lights are on (I believe the * next to the power is usually on when the network is active). If I manually set an IP I can&#039;t ping the router at 192.168.1.1 nor can I try to SSH or Telnet into it, nor does the webpage work. If I try to let DHCP assign me one, Windows never finds the DHCP server or gateway (seen by the ARP spamming in WireShark) and settles with an APIPA address. Just to see if maybe DD wasn&#039;t working I flashed the 3/9/16 full build of DD and once it rebooted the * was lit up and then after about a minute it acquired an address via DHCP. </p><p>Any idea why the builds aren&#039;t working for me?</p>									</div>

					<p>Right you are. So I commented out the 443 listen line in my config, restarted uhttpd, and it no longer has that behavior. So, for whatever reason, as long as it has ssl info on it&#039;s startup that takes priority. But if you just want http access, you can comment out the 443 configuration.</p>									</div>
