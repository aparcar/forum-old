					<p>Hi</p><p>I am having a WRT54GL with openwrt 10.03 as router for my internet. Now I got IPTV into my home, and I want to be able to look IPTV in VLC or connect to Mythtv. Internet and IPTV is coming in from separate RJ45 connections on my fiberbox. Hooking up my PC directly to IPTV lets me see IPTV in VLC. </p><p>So my idea is to use my spare router, a WRT160NL with openwrt 10.03, to serve the IPTV signal to my local net. Plug IPTV into the WAN port on the WRT160NL and do some routing on the WRT54GL . It dosent work. Of course, I have tried a lot of things, and now I am at the place called &quot;confusion&quot; ( read : I dont know what I am doing anymore ) and a lot of concepts is running through my head as igmpproxy, route, multicast and so on. Can I get any guidelines to set this network up ?</p><p>larsbj</p>									</div>
