					<p>One more thing, if you don&#039;t get a answer straight away just be patient as people on the forums don&#039;t log on every day.

					<p>@cmsigler - Thanks for starting this topic. I second the motion for pinning it to the top. A couple more comments:</p><p>1) I would re-order your &quot;Before you post - Getting Started&quot; links like this:</p><p>&nbsp; - Find your router on the Table of Hardware/Supported Devices page (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a>)<br />&nbsp; - Go to its &quot;Device Page&quot; (there&#039;s a link in the Device Page column). Read everything there - it contains information from others who have had success with that model<br />&nbsp; - Search the forums for your router model, or for the text of the message you&#039;re seeing<br />&nbsp; - Search Google for &quot;OpenWrt&quot; plus the text of the error message you&#039;re seeing</p><p>2) I would *not* point anyone to the OpenWrt home page (<a href="https://openwrt.org/">https://openwrt.org/</a>) - the information presented there is not well formatted, and very outdated.</p><p>Thanks again for your efforts!</p>									</div>

					<p>@cmsigler - Your original post seems to combine &quot;First Post&quot; tasks from the &quot;Getting Started with OpenWrt&quot;. I wonder if you want to separate them into two (pinned) topics. If you did, the &quot;Getting Started with OpenWrt&quot; might have some of the same steps:</p><p>Getting Started with OpenWrt:</p><p>&nbsp; - Find your router on the Table of Hardware/Supported Devices page (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a>)<br />&nbsp; - Go to its &quot;Device Page&quot; (there&#039;s a link in the Device Page column). Read everything there - it contains information from others who have had success with that model<br />&nbsp; - Also read the Beginner&#039;s Guide <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/user.beginner">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/user.beginner</a> for an overview of how to work with/install OpenWrt<br />&nbsp; - Then download the firmware. Most Device Pages have links to the proper (working) firmware, along with instructions for installing it.</p><p>Also: Last summer, there was an effort to revise the top pages of the Wiki. Here&#039;s where we left things: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/playground">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/playground</a> This is a draft of what could become the top-level wiki page, or even the main OpenWrt home page. We would encourage anyone to make tweaks, especially in the Newcomer&#039;s Guide, and making both pages&#039; recommendations match &quot;best practices&quot; for new people coming to OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

Your task will be easier to complete without causing problems with your router.</p><p>-- You should get started by reading through <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/installopenwrt">The Installing OpenWRT HOWTO</a> -- This includes another checklist for installing OpenWRT on your router, along with purchasing a router for OpenWRT use, initially connecting to and configuring your router, etc.</p><p>-- <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">The Documentation portal</a> -- Please look <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">here</a> for information or answers before flashing your router or asking questions. There are links to installation guides, configuration guides, HOWTOs and recipes, etc. Very useful and rich!</p><p>1.) Find your router on the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">Table of Hardware/Supported Devices page</a>. Your model may be supported, may not be supported at this time, it may be a WIP (work-in-progress), or it may be unsupportable due to hardware or built-in firmware limitations or incompatibilities. Find out about OpenWRT on your router <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">here</a>.</p><p>2.) Go to the webpage link given for your router under the &quot;Device Page&quot; column of the table. <span class="bbu">Please</span> read that page and understand it <em>completely</em> before trying to install OpenWRT. This is most important if this is your first time installing and using OpenWRT. A thorough understanding will save you, and others who may need to help you, lots of time, effort and worry!</p><p>3.) To improve your planning before you install, go to the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/search.php">Forum Search function</a> and search for your router model. There may be some hiccups with installing OpenWRT on the newest version of your router, etc. By doing a search, you can find out if others have had problems before you have them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>An <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/search.php?advanced=1">Advanced Search</a> is available to refine the results if too many are returned to make sense of them.</p><p>4.) A final step to prepare yourself is to do a Google search with terms &#039;openwrt&#039; and your router make, model and version number. (If you get an error when you install, search for &#039;openwrt&#039; and the complete text of your error message, etc., on Google, and use <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/search.php">the Forum Search</a>.)</p><p>5.) <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/">Downloads</a> -- After you&#039;ve Read <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/">The Fine Manual</a>.

					<p>A couple thoughts:</p><p>1) I like the having each of these articles as &quot;[New User] ...&quot; topics in the forum, especially if we can get them pinned to the top. (These would arguably be more important/useful that most of the topics already listed there...)</p><p>2) Although I always hope people will read my fine prose, I think the tone of these two is a little too strong. Asking someone to understand a Device Page *completely* seems overly burdensome, especially since not all those Device Pages are well written, or even correct. (My rule is that if you have spent 10-15 minutes reading whatever you can find that seems relevant, then *we* have failed you, because we haven&#039;t got the right information in the right place. After taking that time, you&#039;ve earned the right to ask someone :-) </p><p>3) I have reservations about sending someone to the top level of the Wiki as a starting point. It is a jumble of information that hasn&#039;t had serious moderation/editorial in ages. The playground might be a much better place to start someone off.</p><p>4) I also think that people&#039;s first steps should be to look at the Device Page, since that&#039;s has information written by others who own the equipment, and it will be most tuned to the router.</p><p>5) I see that you&#039;ve added both messages to the Newcomer&#039;s Guide. I think the &quot;First-time Poster&quot; article deserves to be its own page, perhaps called &quot;Getting Help with OpenWrt&quot;. It should definitely be linked from the Newcomer Guide main page.</p><p>6) I was hoping that your new &quot;How to get started...&quot; article could be melded into the existing newcomer guide home page. (I wrote that guide, and I&#039;m surely not an expert in OpenWrt...)</p><p>Thanks again for doing this!</p>									</div>
