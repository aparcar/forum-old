					<p>Yup - I have exactly the same question. I am using wrt54g v2. <br />In Whiterussian I used &quot;wl0_txpwr&quot; variable to control the TX power level. I guess that it makes no difference if I put it in the wireless options with some value - ie. 100 - the TX power is unchanged in iwconfig. It used to change in Whiterussian.....<br />Where are the availale option for the wireless configuration - only these reported by &quot;wlc&quot; ? <br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/docs/wireless.tex">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/docs/wireless.tex</a> is also a bit short....</p><p>Michal</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yans</strong> on 4 Apr 2007, 02:39)</p>

So It will be wonderful to be able to increase txpower on my WRT54GSv4 with kamikaze.</p><p>Any hint on how can I do that?<br />Thanks in advance<br />Tuxerg</p>									</div>

					<p>I have to agree some of the older Linksys units would have better reception and throughput on marginal links when boosting their power to their max.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, cross channel interference also went up drastically when set past 80 mw.&nbsp; </p><p>The wl txpwr1 is the command to set the power.&nbsp; You will need the wl package.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>txpwr1  Set tx power in in various units.

Can be combined with:
        -o turn on override to disable regulatory and other limitations
