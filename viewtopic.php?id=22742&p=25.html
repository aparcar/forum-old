					<p>Changing the channel and/or distance parameters unfortunately makes no difference. An interesting new fact is, that with &quot;hwmode 11g&quot; the connection is stable. Obviously I can only transfer 2.6 MB/s because of 802.11g but I do not have high packet loss anymore. When I just change hwmode from 11g to 11ng (to enable 802.11n) the connection drops to &lt;10KB/s. In Wireshark I see &quot;TCP Dup ACK&quot;, &quot;TCP Out-Of-Order&quot; and so on all the time. So something seems to be wrong with 802.11n mode. Maybe some issues with the kernel modules in latest trunk, don&#039;t know.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, thanks for your answer but even using exactly your settings makes no difference.<br />But I noticed that another laptop is able to connect and transfer data at about 4 MB/s using 802.11n. This other laptop has a atheros 802.11n chipset. My personal laptop has a intel 5300 wifi-card.<br />With a linksys WRT160Nv2 (ralink) the intel card works perfect at up to fast ethernet speed over wireless.<br />So it looks like the intel card won&#039;t work properly with the atheros chip used in the 1043ND. :-(</p>									</div>

					<p>Of course I am also just a human and therefore able to make misstakes. :-)<br />But I just checked the intel website and the version of my drivers (13.1.1.1) is still recent.</p><p>I can associate with the ap and I can succesfully ping a wired device. Even large icmp packets (1400 bytes) work without any problems. But as soon as I initiate a first file transfer (e.g. ftp) the association remains but I cannot transmit any packets over the network, pings stop working either. Even after cancelling the ftp transfer the pings do not start working again.</p><p>I could also find some postings in the internet that intel and atheros devices do not perform very well, but I did not expect that they would perform that worse. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>First I want to say thanks to Shibby for his excellent firmware. I have a number of questions though.</p><p>Is there a consistent way to rebuild the firmware and the relevant packages with the shibby&#039;s patches? I have found out some of the patches plus the original config file for building the firmware on his site but I think there should be other things as well. Some history:</p><p>It seems that I have a lot of APs in my neighborhood thus it is very hard to find &quot;relatively&quot; quiet channels for HT40 in the usual range of 1-11. As I live in Europe I can make use of channels 12 &amp; 13 but the firmware needs to be rebuild with: ATH_USER_REGD=y otherwise these channels cannot be selected. Then I was plagued by the sporadic disassociation problem with ath9k explained here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=109617">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=109617</a>. So I wanted to svn switch mac80211 and hostapd to trunk on a backfire checkout and rebuild.</p><p>When I have tried the new image everything was working as expected apart from two major problems: the imq module seems to be broken and any tc commands (e.g. from qos-scripts) just reboot the router, and the openvpn server is exhibiting the problem mentioned in this bug: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7159">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7159</a> (i.e. openvpn uses 100% of the CPU).</p><p>Using shibby&#039;s repository for kmod_ipt_imq and kmod_tun none of these problems are exhibited despite the fact that the firmware is the one described above (i.e. a custom backfire build). Is there any chance these packages (on <a href="http://openwrt.groov.pl/WR1043NDv1/backfire-10.3/packages/)">http://openwrt.groov.pl/WR1043NDv1/back … packages/)</a> could come from different builds of the firmware or have custom patches applied? </p><p>George.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi George,</p><p>thanks for your post.<br />It sound greate that you got the channels 12 and 13 get to work.<br />Can you explane me more about the process with the ATH_USER_REGD?<br />Did you need to compile the hole router firmware or only the firmware for the wireless adapter on the router?<br />And an other question where are you coming from?</p><p>Best regards Robert</p>									</div>

					<p>@no_Legend</p><p>I have started by checking out the backfire branch (svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/tags/backfire_10.03), copied over shibby&#039;s config file (as .config), then changed dir to packages/mac80211 and done a switch to trunk (svn switch svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/package/mac80211). Then run &quot;make menuconfig&quot;, gone to &quot;kernel modules&quot; -&gt; Wireless Drivers, under kmod-ath checked &quot;Force Atheros drivers to respect the user&#039;s regdomain settings&quot;. Since ath9k was build into the image I had to rebuild the whole image.</p><p>This way I got the latest patches for ath9k plus channels 12 and 13. I still get the no-association bug occasionally so it seems that more work needs to be done on the ath9k side from the developers. The bug manifests as a total disappearance of the wireless signal for the clients. All the clients get disconnected and only a &quot;wifi up&quot; on the router fixes the problem.</p><p>I live in Greece.</p><p>George.</p>									</div>
