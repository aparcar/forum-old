					<p>I previously posted a similar message in the Whiterussian area, but I received no responses and I upgraded to Kamikaze 7.09.&nbsp; I have two LANs each with their own internet connection -- cable internet and dsl internet each on their own LAN with their own computers.&nbsp; I want to connect the two LANs so I can share resources between them (i.e. a network printer).&nbsp; I happened to have a WRT54G around and it seemed like that and OpenWrt would be a good match for what I wanted to do.&nbsp; </p><p>One LAN is 192.168.1.0/24 and the other is 10.1.10.0/24.&nbsp; The interfaces on the router are 192.168.1.5 and 10.1.10.5 respectively. The router is connected to both LANs and I can ping it from either side.&nbsp; If example,</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ ping 192.168.1.5
PING 192.168.1.5 (192.168.1.5) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.1.5: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.05 ms</code></pre></div><p>If I traceroute from the 192.168.1.0 network to the 10.1.10.0 network, the packets seem to go to the default router for the network where the request originates:&nbsp; For example, from a computer on 192.168.1.0</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ traceroute -n 10.1.10.1
traceroute to 10.1.10.1 (10.1.10.1), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets

 2  *
^C</code></pre></div><p>Do I need setup static routes on all my computers or is there something I need to configure (RIP?) that advertises the route to 10.1.10.0 through 192.168.1.5?</p><p>If I add a static route for 10.1.10.0 through 192.1.168.5, the packets seem to get to the to the correct router (I see the packet count increasing in iptables), but they don&#039;t seem to get forwarded through it.&nbsp; Here are my iptable rules:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# iptables -L -v
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 154K packets, 43M bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 103 packets, 9476 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
   96  8832            all  --  br-lan eth0.1  192.168.1.0/24       10.1.10.0/24

					<p>OK.&nbsp; I figured some of it out.&nbsp; I noticed in my monowall router&#039;s (192.168.1.1) firewall log, the pings from the 10.1.10.0 network were getting blocked.&nbsp; The default only allowed traffic from the local network not just everything on the local network&#039;s interface.&nbsp; I added a rule to allow traffic from the 10.1.10.0 network and pings started working.</p><p>Unfortunately, I&#039;m not out of the woods yet as I still can&#039;t get to other nodes on 192.168.1.0 from 10.1.10.0.&nbsp; My guess is that the static route I have setup in the monowall router only applies to the network and not the interface sort of like the firewall rule.&nbsp; I guess I need to jump over to the monowall forums unless you have any other ideas.&nbsp; -- Bud</p>									</div>
