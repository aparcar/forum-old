					<p>Hi all.<br />I have a web enabled device in the LAN which is using plain HTTP for both authentication e services.<br />I don&#039;t want to use it over the internet &quot;as is&quot; and would like to reverse proxy that web UI via HTTPS.<br />Is this possible? If so, how?</p><p>TIA.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you should use nginx, which should be available as a package for OpenWRT.<br />Have a look at: <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/SSL-Offloader">http://wiki.nginx.org/SSL-Offloader</a><br />Perhaps there are better resources.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.<br />It&#039;s a quite complex webpage suitable for Ubuntu Linux.<br />Nonetheless I&#039;ll try to adapt it to my situation.<br />I would also appreciate a &quot;simpler&quot; approach to this problem,&nbsp; if any.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
