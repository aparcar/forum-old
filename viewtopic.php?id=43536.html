					<p>Hello Guys,</p><p>I wonder since you have nightly builds of the entire packages, so why is it then when I check out the snap shots and enable most packages specifically kernel drivers, my build breaks. Apparently you guys build it overnight, so what is the difference ? Thanks for any insight.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you hang around the IRC channel of #openwrt-devel, you will notice not all builds are built out of the box. For me, I only selected packages I want to build. This will reduce the chance of getting problems in compilation.</p>									</div>

					<p>what I find confusing is apparently they are being built nightly, and I run into erros like header files not found. Which I am sure are there but not being pointed to correct location.</p>									</div>
