					<p>Hi,<br />I broke the config. Ok. Was trying to have guest vlans in this box and Kamikaze was doing fine but my wife&#039;s phone was rejecting to associate with the hidden SSID.<br />So I decided to upgrade to see if newer code had better WL support.<br />Tried two variants of Tomato, and both refused to program a trunk in the uplink, which I know works because I was using it in this same system.<br />And I read that 10.3.1 (BackFire) was ok in this hardware, and I flashed it.<br />Luci run ok, but somehow the code also was refusing to accept an uplink trunk consisting of two vlans.<br />(internal and guest, I&#039;m using the AP just for WL, real border services are in a dedicated server).</p><p>So I moved to command line programming of the internal switch using nvram.<br />To be consistent with external switches, I renamed vlan 0 to vlan 1... and forgot to change the internal interface, so now the internal if is disconnected and the external ports link to wan interface (vlan 1).</p><p>Ok, let&#039;s failsafe and start over ? I can&#039;t.<br />I see the udp packet, but instead of &quot;press now to enter failsafe&quot; the contents is &quot;dead&quot;.<br />I can not bring it into failsafe mode, it won&#039;t no matter the tens of times I&#039;ve tried different timings.</p><p>I thought the console port was going to help, so I soldered a 4 pin connector and connected a serial port (using a level converter) and nothing. A scope confirms that it seems to be no activity in the serial port in all the boot process.</p><p>I know it is booting, power blinks, DMZ comes on, it even asks for DHCP (WAN) on all ports.<br />I don&#039;t have an LPT port in current machines, that I guess is needed for jtag, but it seems that is the only way out now. </p><p>Help ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Strange that you don&#039;t see anything on the serial port.</p><p>It might have a CFE mode.&nbsp; This is where you hold down the reset button while booting and the bootloader stops the boot and serves a web page that lets you upload and flash firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Beats me, I don&#039;t really understand the whole loading sequence, and I had run into failsafe before.<br />In fact, it seems I have to pay more attention before trying to have it work the way I want <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I&#039;ve decided to apply a &quot;last resort&quot; flash address tinkering and it worked.<br />Due thanks to Voidmain&#039;s notes.</p><p>Now back to get my uplink trunking as I want it. If anyone has some pointers to a guest ssid setup on a WRT54Gv2, I&#039;m all ears (AP only, WPA2, multi SSID)</p>									</div>

					<p>Should be about the same as any other hardware.&nbsp; You need to be aware of the port numbers of course.</p><p>Looks like you could:<br /><strong>first</strong> make a lan wifi AP and connect it to lan.&nbsp; Then you can use it to log into the router even if you mess up the ethernet ports.<br />change the wan port (5) in the switch from untagged in 1 to tagged in both 0 and 1 -- this will be your uplink cable<br />delete the wan interface<br />make a new interface (bridged) called guests and connect to eth0.1<br />make guest wifi AP and connect to guests</p><p>I didn&#039;t think that VLAN0 works over cable you may need to re-number it to something else.&nbsp; In that case be sure to change it in lan physical settings also.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for being here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Your plan is like I was trying to do, but I goofed about the processor vlan access change.</p><p>What bothers me (actually what I don&#039;t fully understand) is that the switch insist in tagging when I&#039;m not asking to.<br />E.g. I now have:</p><p># cat /etc/config/network<br />#### VLAN configuration<br />config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enable&nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option reset 1</p><p>config switch_vlan eth0_0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot;</p><p>config switch_vlan eth0_1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 5&quot;</p><p>config switch_vlan eth0_4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;4t 5&quot;</p><p>#### Loopback configuration<br />config interface loopback<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;lo&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;127.0.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.0.0.0</p><br /><p>#### WAN configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; safe<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p><p>#### LAN configuration<br />config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.1&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;172.30.0.213<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway&nbsp; 172.30.0.1</p><br /><p>#### WAN configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.2&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; dhcp</p><br /><p>#### GUEST configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; guest<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.4&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;172.30.3.2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p><p># cat /proc/switch/eth0/vlan/[0124]/ports</p><p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4t*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5t*<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5t<br />4t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5t</p><p>Notice the &quot;safe&quot; if just in case, although I did not need it.<br />But the vlan 1 is being tagged even though I did not ask for that in the config file.<br />I&#039;m looking forward to convert port 4 in a trunk, with vlan 1 native.<br />Will change the switch to tag everything and hope it will work, but it is not obvious...</p>									</div>

					<p>Sigh,<br />the upstream switch (a MicroTik switch) refuses to &quot;digest&quot; the vlan tag, so as the frames get tagged, then the hosts do not understand them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>And I don&#039;t get why from my &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; line, the switch gets &quot;1 2 3 4t* 5t*&quot;.<br />If I write &quot;1 2 3 4 5t*&quot; it works, so I guess I will stick that into an rc script.

					<p>It seems it won&#039;t work.<br />Whenever I config a second SSID, the wireless does not work.<br />So I gave up on the WRT54G, and tried another AP (ADB A4001N), also based on Broadcom radio.<br />And b43 code which does not support multi SSID <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I could not make it work with brcmsmac either. And I could not find any compatible broadcom driver.</p><p>Giving up un multi ssid for the time being.</p>									</div>
