					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve recently been getting fed up with the limited settings and arcane interface for my router, a Corega WLBARGM (MIMO) and am currently looking to the open source community for solutions.<br/>From what I can tell based on the limited information available my router seems to share a some hardware with the Linksys WRT54GTv2 and Netgear WPNT834, but not all of it, so i feel optimistic about finding a usable firmware. </p><p>Below follows what I know of the hardware specs.</p><p>Processor: RTL8651B (realtek)<br/>Wireless: Airgo AGN102BB-01 (Mini-PCI)<br/>RAM: ESMT M12L64164A-5TG x2 (32M total)<br/>Flash: MX 29LV320ABTC-90G (32M-Bit [4Mx8/2Mx16] 3V 90 ns flash with 64K-Byte sector for security at &quot;bottom&quot;) &lt;&lt; thanks OpenWrt forums!! ^^</p><p>My first question is.. is there a firmware/wireless driver available for this hardware? The second question is.. what, if any, would be a viable firmware if available?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think maybe I&#039;ll just pick up one of the supported routers and play around with my Corega router on the side and see if I can get it to work with a better firmware than the standard one.</p>									</div>
