					<p>I can confirm your findings, I believe that LuCI included with the release builds is taking up the missing space. You can use the image builder and simply add PACKAGES=&quot;openvpn&quot; to the command line. It will fit fine (from own experience, I keep a flock of MR3020s for various tasks), and image builder does not add LuCI by default.</p><p>/edit: Image builder on current trunk may be broken, it fails to build a package list for me. The AA-rc1 one&#039;s works fine tho.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 7 Mar 2013, 23:36)</p>

To end the guessing: I actually run an MR3020 exactly like the OP wants it. With OpenVPN and all its dependencies (yes, including OpenSSL) included, built with the Image Builder for AA rc1, its file system looks like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on

Custom images do not include the LuCI packages, and LuCI is important to maintain a router for those not adept to use the text shell. I do not want to answer complaints about LuCI or some other component missing, or about an outdated image or whatnot, I simply cannot be bothered.</p><p>Also, it&#039;s not exactly witchcraft and sorcery. I just went and fetched the Image Generator, followed the instructions, and built my image with*<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make image PROFILE=TLMR3020 PACKAGES=&quot;openvpn&quot;</code></pre></div><p>However, if you&#039;re keen on using OpenVPN and do not mind the missing LuCI package, I believe the easiest way would be to just use a trunk image (that never includes LuCI) and install OpenVPN via opkg.</p><p>(* Full disclosure: That is not entirely true, I threw in some other packages too, most prominently &quot;znc&quot;. I use my little MR3020s not as routers but as always-on communication hubs in my networks, which they do a fine job with. If they replace a fully powered PC, with their tiny power footprint, they practically pay for themselves within a few months.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 26 Jun 2013, 13:02)</p>

					<p>Hello all.</p><p>Am I able to simply flash FriedZombie&#039;s file to a new MR3020 V1.9 router bought this week please? I&#039;m vaguely familiar with openWRT having used it on TP-703N devices but I&#039;m having to take someone else through the flashing process (remotely) and the last thing I need is a friend with a bricked device!</p><p>They&#039;re after what is discussed here: OpenWRT with OpenVPN and preferably luci so they can see what they&#039;re configuring. The device will act pretty much solely as a VPN server, to be accessed from around the world whilst away from home.</p><p>I&#039;ve looked at the image generator but it&#039;s a bit above my station I fear.&nbsp; Thank you for any pointers.</p>									</div>
