					<p>Right now, I have my (de-bricked, thanks wzab) WAP54G set up in repeater mode, the Client (Bridge) option in webif^2.</p><p>However, there&#039;s 2 other ways I could have set it up to bridge, correct?</p><p>* WDS with the main AP (WRT54G running OpenWRT)<br />* Bridge the WLAN and the Ethernet interfaces and use AP mode</p><p>I&#039;m using repeater mode as it was easiest to set up (after setting lan_ifname=eth2 instead of br0, to avoid the &quot;received packet with&nbsp; own address as source address&quot; problem). I don&#039;t think WDS is really necessary as we have only one other AP, and bridging the lan and wan interfaces and using AP mode would make clients be wishy-washy about which AP they associate to, the main or the secondary.</p><p>What would you guys recommend for my purpose? I was berated for having the AP as a client, as apparently it wastes bandwidth between the main AP and the secondary.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hm. Apparently using Client-Bridge mode doesn&#039;t actually do much for me, even when setting iwconfig&#039;s mode to repeater. So, I just switched to using the bridge and AP mode, and I guess the clients will flop between APs as they see fit.</p>									</div>
