					<p>i love the logos NiKO has made. i seem to like the version without the eyebrows better though. the eyebrows just kinda seem out of place. besides that, it may give someone the &quot;oh neat&quot; surprise that the &quot;op&quot; in openwrt is actually the character&#039;s face if they don&#039;t notice it at first.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here&#039;s my submission. I think a simple monospaced font like Bitstream Vera Sans Mono looks great, sort of ties in with the whole CLI thing. Also, I know that the wireless arc things are really overused, but due to the wireless nature of OpenWrt, I think it&#039;s hard to represent that fundamental part without something like the cliché arcs. And the hammer is supposed to represent, you know, a tool. or something. It was drawn without any reference, so it may look kind of goofy; I could make adjustments to its shape.</p><p>Any feedback is very welcome.</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/4430/openwrt1xd.png" alt="http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/4430/openwrt1xd.png" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>yoo master, i think im unable to do logos for teenagers, i dont like those bubblegummy logos i have to say it... im far from having the touch NiCO has, i have no package for making all those 3d effects and im still testing in black and white, so i guess im off and pay respect to nicos work that gather so much attention, but still as i understant the silence of MBM the logo is not here yet. I truly will like to see your proposals i have a very strong image of the surfer one, fantastic...a shame that it crosses so many borders and everyone gets so afraid of them.. i have to say i love the idea of using &quot;scribbles&quot; in any project.. it goes with my humor and way of looking at everything mass media related.</p><p>anyway i had this ones, they are also in process, far from finished and as said above they lack those little cartoon caracthers that everyone loves so much in the opensource world.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://co.lab.cohete.net/Wifi/lasttry.png" alt="http://co.lab.cohete.net/Wifi/lasttry.png" /></span></p><p>if i get a chance i will download a propietary software called painter and try that way, since till now im more in the gimp and related area.</p><p>cheers, nice meals and good drinks!</p><p>/a</p>									</div>
