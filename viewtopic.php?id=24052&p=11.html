This is why I only provide the sysupgrade firmware (for upgrading in OPENWRT ONLY) and the tftp firmware so no one who cannot follow the tftp procedure can upload it to their router......&nbsp; thats the idea anyway....</p><p>Heres the link, will take you 10min, relax these router have a fail-safe every time you reboot it, it opens 192.168.11.1 and waits for a tftp transfer for a few seconds, I admit they could have made the whole tftp alot easier you have to wonder who comes up with this shit.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=140742#p140742">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 42#p140742</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Glad to see you around to help out.&nbsp; When you say it&#039;s fail-safe it gives certainly&nbsp; more hope even after trying tftp so many times but with XP tftp and static arp(arp -s &lt;MAC&gt;)</p><p>To undertand whether I missed the router response to tftp reponse, I ran wirehsark to see if really the router repsonds to tftp request though not very sure if it&#039;s still possible to miss the packet from the router. So far there is not a even a single packet from the router, which makes me to think that things are bad. </p><p>Few things i&#039;ll try is adding the arp as you have said mapping to the interface rather just a static arp which I tried and the pumpkin. Also will follow what &#039;techweenie&#039; has suggested. </p><p>Do I need to connect a switch in between the PC and router as I see the interface of the PC goes up/down twice before it&#039;s up?&nbsp; </p><p>Does the router stay in 192.168.11.x only for few seconds before downing it. Now I connect to the LAN port nearest to WAN.?</p><p>Which firmware should I&#039;ve rightfully be using? trunk &#039;factory&#039; ?</p><p>Thanks for all the help.</p></blockquote></div><p>My guide is made for windows 7, it should work in winxp verify if it does please. Reading around the net it&#039;s claimed winxp is easier to tftp , but then again I tried about 5 different ubuntu tftp guides none of which ever worked.</p><p>In my limited experience only the Pumpkin tftp software would fully upload the file other tftp utils would bomb out 3/4 of the way no idea why, tftp is a big pain in the arse is part of the reason....</p><p>Just follow the guide word for word I made it specifically for new users like myself using windows 7, and it is fully tested unlike Alot of other guides.</p><p> just plug an Ethernet cable directly from your motherboard to your router with nothing in between.&nbsp; Don&#039;t confuse yourself just follow the guide exactly, once you do it you will have a better understanding</p><p>Use the &quot;buffalo&quot; &quot;Friendly firmware&quot; for a recovery then you can install ddwrt if you want.</p></blockquote></div><p>My problem continues. While I&#039;m able to do tftp without fail I can&#039;t make any firmware work. When I tiried original buffalo firmware it rejected &quot;Unspport Model&quot;.

					<p>Hey bcmalloy,</p><p>thanks for that. In linux the ntfs has a poor performance. So ext4 would be a better choose. Anyway I`m not the only one using it so maybe someone else wants ntfs. For me it can be both :-) I think 4 or 8 kb more is not so bad :-)</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>
