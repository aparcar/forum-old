					<p>Hi folk,<br />I&#039;ve just installed OpenWRT and I can connect my device with ssh root@192.168.1.1 (a passord is set). I can ping my device (on ethernet).<br />The first thing which surprising me is the web interface doesn&#039;t work (like there <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsXI9VWFCRY)">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsXI9VWFCRY)</a><br />The second thing is my wireless Network is not available.<br />But before, I would like to test the failsafe mode just in case of something goes wrong. I restart my device, I push the button when the first leds blink. At the end the SYS Led&nbsp; blinks very very fast. I guess that my device is in safe mode. But I can&#039;t either ping it nor telnet it !<br />When I plug the cable on a swicth (just to monitor the port), the port is going up with a speed of 1000 MB/s but I can&#039;t see any IP or even Mac address.<br />Anybody could be able to help me ? Any guidelines are really appreciated.<br />Regards,<br />Matro</p>									</div>

					<p>have you tried the wan port<br />once you go back to first boot, if you dont see LuCi its because the file you flashed does not inlcude it, you have to download it, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a> <br />wireless by default its disable, you have to enable it. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />Yes I saw that for wireless. It&#039;s there:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /etc/config/wireless <br />config wifi-device&nbsp; radio0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; # REMOVE THIS LINE TO ENABLE WIFI:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option disabled 1</p><p>For the GUI, I didn&#039;t find the bin with the GUI inside. I will install after, It doesn&#039;t look really hard ;-)</p><p>For the last question, yes I tried the WAN port without success. Bascially, I tried the five Ethernet port but It doesn&#039;t work. </p><p>If the LED is blinking very fast, I&#039;m in the Failsafe mode or I could be elsewhere (on bootloader, or other... )?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Matro</strong> on 6 Feb 2014, 17:10)</p>

					<p>Thanks again. Basically even if my device is a wr1043nd V2, the procedure looks like rather than this one :</p><p>&gt; On a TL-WDR4300 Ver 1.6 and Barrier Breaker Bleeding Edge, r39211, the above instructions were not terribly successful. The only way that I was able to get the router into failsafe mode was to quickly and repeatedly press the WPS/Reset button starting before the front panel &quot;star&quot; LED started flashing. When that LED finally lit, it appeared to go directly into the rapid-flashing &quot;failsafe&quot; indication. If the WPS LED lights (rightmost, &quot;yin-yang arrows&quot;), it may be that you started clicking the button a little early in the boot sequence. &lt;</p><p>At the end, the star LED is blinking very fast, but impossible to ping or telnet my device :-/</p><p>I&#039;m afraid to modify the config files without having test successfully the failsafe mode...</p><p>Matro</p>									</div>

					<p>Honestly, I did many many test without success (100 Mb / wireshark etc...).<br />On wireshark when my laptop does an ARP request who is 192.168.1.1 nobody answer.</p><p>I suspect a bug in failsafemode. </p><p>Any feedback could be helpful.</p><p>Matro</p>									</div>

					<p>well basically i have no idea why you&#039;re not getting telnet in failsafe mode, exept for what you see in the links in that topic...</p><p>anyway, try to change some settings (easy things.. change wifi SSID ^^), then try to default it by keeping reset button pressed for several seconds after it&#039;s fully booted.</p>									</div>
