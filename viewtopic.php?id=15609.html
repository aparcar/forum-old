					<p>In layman&#039;s terms, the AP is not advertising its presence by broadcasting management packets containing the network name (ESSID) and other information.&nbsp; Also known as &#039;cloaked&#039;, or &#039;hidden&#039;.</p><p>The ESSID can still be derived from data packets with no issue (just at a different offset), but if there is no activity on the network it cannot be detected by packets.&nbsp; All this serves to do is prevent devices without prior knowledge of the ESSID from automatically joining the network; it adds no more security than adding a blank cover-sheet to a document does.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aoz.syn</strong> on 9 May 2008, 20:31)</p>
