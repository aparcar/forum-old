					<p>just need help of experts here a bit ... I have ordered this item &#039;MAX3232 RS232 Serial Port To TTL Converter Module DB9 Connector 5V, RS232 to TTL&#039; just to use it to see the boot process on tera term or putty on my Win7 of Airgrid m5 hp..<br />If i ever need to Flash Airgrid with Openwrt&#039;s software would this cable be useable? I think i hv found 4 serial ttl points on the device<br />1. 3.3v = Vcc&nbsp; <br />2. Rx = 0.01v&nbsp; <br />3. Tx = 2.6v<br />4. GND = 0v<br />so I was hoping if these pins could be used serial ttl converter to check the booting process on pc?<br />Please help me here.. i have been at it for days without any success. <br />Plus can a USB to serial ttl cable connector be used instead of DB9 connector here?</p>									</div>
