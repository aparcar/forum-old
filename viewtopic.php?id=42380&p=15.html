					<p><strong>Toutatis</strong><br />I have spent a lot of time trying to make working properly my routers (both Lantiq based).<br />Seems to me Lantiq platform is very sensitive to pulsed interference from power supply.</p><p>Stability a little improved when i used PSU Mean Well LRS-35-12. But some kind of pulsed interference require a grounding of this PSU.<br />Also DC Voltage is important. Too high over 12.6V will produce more errors, Too law (less then 12.2v) - and LAN is not working properly.</p><p>At the moment I did not get work of the router perfect on both stock and LEDE firmware<br />Here is statistic after 2 days of work with 1 DSL reconnect:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ifconfig

					<p>No, you cant. You can install Openwrt/Lede firmware using wiring or using clip-in programmer. We are doing this all the time for 20 euros. Later upgrades via web after then are possible.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello guys, I&#039;m new in this forum, I think my router is bricked.<br />I&#039;ve followed all the steps provided by s7mx1 and at the last steps when I used these two commands : </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /var/usbdisk/sda1/td-w8970/openwrt-lantiq-xrx200-TDW8970-sysupgrade.image &gt; /dev/mtdblock1

					<p>Thanks for information, I think all the problem comes from DD, I used it on windows and I don&#039;t have any knowledge of using that, any command I use it doesn&#039;t work and I get same command in output.

Is it the right one ?</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Installation</p><p>At the time of writing, the only known method of installation involves access to the bootloader, which requires using the serial console.

Note that it&#039;s necessary to choose to compress the initramfs with LZMA (this worked at least for me) to succesfully boot.<br />Ensure that you have a working tftp server on you system, serving the initramfs image, and to have ethernet connnected to the device with a proper ip address set.<br />Connect to the serial console, power the device on and press any key on the serial console until you get a prompt, then run commands similar to these:<br />Set the device&#039;s IP if you don&#039;t want the default 192.168.1.1: (so you don&#039;t have to move your TFTP server onto a different subnet)</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>Thanks in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sohilj23</strong> on 1 Apr 2017, 13:49)</p>

					<p>I have installed OpenWrt on my TP-Link TD-W8970 following the instructions in the wiki for TD-W9980: Web Interface Hack (Install openWRT without opening the case). Did not install DSL drivers because I do not have internet for this router and only want to use its Wifi to connect to my local network. Everything seems to be working fine, except that changes I make in the web interface, e.g change root password or enable Wifi, is not remebered/saved after reboot. It seems to me (newbie) as if changes remain only in volatile memory. How to find out what is going on, please help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have one of these routers running LEDE with SQM (cake/codel) turned on (not significant in itself - but mentioned because of associated circumnstances). I also have collectd so I can collect cpu/mem stats. If I saturate the connection by triggering lots of downloads everything works fine for sometime. </p><p>However at some point the router will drop all connections (all TCP connections - the ADSL2 connection itself stays up fine), this is associated with a brief and sudden spike in CPU. Nothing else is happening on the router at the time.&nbsp; I should point out that the ADSL2 is connecting at around 20Mb/s so it&#039;s not as if I&#039;m running into the internal bandwidth limit.</p>									</div>
