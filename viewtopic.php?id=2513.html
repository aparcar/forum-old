					<p>Hi.</p><p>I was wondering if any got a hint for me:<br />I want to remove OpenWrt and install an other firmware, because OpenWrt is too advanced for me. I have tried the guide in the documentation:</p><p>...&quot;dd bs=32 skip=1 if=original.bin of=original.trx<br />cd /tmp<br />wget <a href="http://www.example.org/original.trx">http://www.example.org/original.trx</a><br />mtd -e linux -r write original.trx linux&quot;...</p><p>but I have not got enought space on my router (WRT54G v2.2) for the image file.</p><p>I installed OpenWrt from Linksys&#039; original firmware by the web-interface-firmware tool.<br />I have tried to enable boot_wait in OpenWrt and burn the image with tftp but without any luck (is it not possible, or am I doing something wrong?).</p><p>What is the best thing for me to do?</p><p>Thanks Ulrik</p>									</div>

					<p>I recently installed OpenWRT WhiteRussian RC2 on my WRT54g v2.1 router and experienced tons of (self-inflicted) problems before I figured it all out.&nbsp; Several times I had to reinstall original Linksys firmware and &quot;start fresh&quot;.</p><p>One thing I don&#039;t quite grok is &quot;boot_wait&quot;.&nbsp; Mine is set to &quot;off&quot; in NVRAM and I&#039;ve never had an issue with being able to TFTP over firmwares on boot.&nbsp; Go figure.</p><p>Here is what I had to do:</p><p>1. Download the latest (4.04?) firmware from Linksys and unzip the .bin file.<br />2. Get TFTP running on your machine by following the docs at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing#head-344b77cce4d63bd941eb782ea25d37f9e8fd9d19">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins … f9e8fd9d19</a><br />3. Power down then power up your router.&nbsp; It should start the TFTP.</p><p>If it doesn&#039;t TFTP, you might have to power down and short the pins on the flash chip to force it.&nbsp; I had to do this once or twice with stubborn firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting#head-62cbed9884432ea7f042093f707eafbbb8daacbd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Tro … bbb8daacbd</a></p><p>This should allow you to &quot;revert&quot; to the Linksys firmware.&nbsp; From there you can use their web interface to upload a different firmware.</p><p> -Charles</p>									</div>

					<p>When you transfer the new firmware to openwrt, save it in the /tmp directory!!!!!&nbsp; This is a ramdisk, and doesn&#039;t take up actual space in the flash memory, so you&#039;ll have plenty of room.</p><p>Also, the thing with using tftp is that there is no DHCP to assign your computer an address, so you have to manually set a static IP that will be able to talk to the router during it&#039;s boot at a temporary address.</p><p>The router will be using 192.168.1.1, so try setting your computer to 192.168.1.2</p><p>Also, if you&#039;re using WinXP on your computer, you may want to try placing a network switch of some kind between the computer and the router, as WinXP can be slow to detect and relink with the router when it comes back up.</p><p>Good luck</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AzCowboy</strong> on 3 Sep 2005, 18:48)</p>
