					<p>I&#039;ve been skimming the forums and found a few topics about using OpenWRT as a client. Many of the links are dated. If anyone can point me to a more current (Kamikaze) thread or how to I would be grateful.<br />Using OpenWRT what would be the easiest way to connect an OpenWRT as a client?<br />I envisioned the typical:<br />iwconfig wl0 essid &#039;foo&#039;<br />dhclient wl0 </p><p>However, there is no dhclient. It does not seem that I would use dhcpcd in the same way.<br />The process I&#039;ve seen thus far seems a bit more involved setting NVRAM variables. (This does not seem current as I would expect UCI commands.)</p><p>I&#039;ll need to be able to set this up quickly without access to the internet. Does anyone have a script they&#039;re using? (or have used?)</p><p>I know not all wpa modes are supported in client mode, but does anyone have any scripts for establishing a client connection using OpenWRT as the client?</p>									</div>

					<p>It also depends on what router you have.&nbsp; brcm47xx only supports client mode with a 2.4 kernel at this time--which gives you other restrictions.</p>									</div>
