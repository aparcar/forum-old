					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I have a couple of AR71XX devices running OpenWrt in WDS Mode. One is the main router broadcasting as a WDS Access Point.<br />Other is a client and also rebroadcasts via WDS.<br />Now that IPv6 is enabled by default, what changes should be made with respect to the WDS configuration. I have DHCPv6 leases for machines on both routers and something jus2t doesn&#039;t jive.<br />Not seems to be broken. Everything just works. My ISP doesn&#039;t have IPv6 yet. However I am trying to tweak it so that DHCPv6 leases are assigned by only one router (and not both). What is supposed to be the correct behaviour?</p><p>Would really appreciate it if someone could update the WDS guide to include necessary steps for having the right DHCPv6 settings as well. Seems both routers are assigning IPv6 addresses to one device at the moment. </p><p>Thanks,<br />chhatc</p>									</div>

					<p>You should set all the routers by the dump ap recipe (except the main). I&#039;d try also<br />/etc/init.d/odhcpd stop<br />/etc/init.d/odhcpd disable<br />I don&#039;t know what exactly is odhcpd for, but it has to do something with ipv6...</p>									</div>
