					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have a strange problem:<br />Device: TP-Link TL-WR1043ND ver 1.11</p><p>Installed OpenWRT successfully, then installed Transmission, and things to be able to mount an usb hdd.<br />I thought i have mounted the hdd correctly to /home, and started to download a torrent into it. Downloading started, but after a few seconds it stopped (disk full). I realized that the /home was not the hdd, so the problem seemed solved, when i deleted the downloaded data to free up some space on the router.</p><p>Since i deleted the torrent data, Luci config does not works correctly: i can login via web browser but after a couple of seconds it stops responding, and the browser keeps on loading, but nothing happends.</p><p>I have restarted the router, re-installed openwrt (with and without keeping config files) but Luci is not working.<br />Same situation: can log in, but after some seconds it stops..</p><p>Everything on the router (lan, wlan) works, can login with putty without any problem.</p><p>Can anyone help me with this?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Istvan</p>									</div>
