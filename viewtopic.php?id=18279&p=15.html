					<p>Hi WNR2000V1 lovers. </p><p>I successfully compiled LEDE Reboot 17.01-SNAPSHOT r3285-111cf1b firmware for our old router. It is fully functional and there are different versions of it. </p><p>First, you need to flash Fuhry&#039;s bootloader from this forum and&nbsp; establish a serial connection to the router. You will also have to setup a tftp server&nbsp; for transferring files. </p><p>The installation instructions and the &quot;bin&quot; files are inside this download link &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7XbZBWKt-f2cEJaLWVmdzJRMUU">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7XbZ … WVmdzJRMUU</a></p><p>After the installation you will have around 160 Kb free space in the flash. It is not too much. But technically, with that 4Mb flash, there is nothing much to do. </p><p>Enjoy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>faruktezcan</strong> on 5 Apr 2017, 06:16)</p>
