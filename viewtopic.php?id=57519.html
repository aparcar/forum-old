					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Dodo has a tag insertion value of 100 on vlan for NBN/Firbe. In the settings for the current router &quot;WAN PPPoE over Vlan 100&quot;</p><p>I am after a guide please of how to set this up via web control panel.</p><p>The standard TP Link Archer C5 interface does not has a simply way to do this so I managed to upgrade the firmware to OPENWRT.</p><p>I have tried to several times to get this to work but most times bricks the unit, I then need to reinstall the Firmware via TFTP (learned to do this via many hours and google after it bricked the first time)</p><p>I assume that I make a Network&gt;switch VLAN ID Port status 100 tagged to the wan port. </p><p>Then I adjust the Network&gt;Physical&nbsp; &nbsp;wan&gt;edit Physical Settings to interface VLAN Interface etho.100 </p><p>Is that even close?</p><p>Thank You and Take Care</p><p>Sebass</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Sebass</strong> on 24 May 2015, 00:59)</p>

					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I know this post is old, but I truly believe in bumping old threads as in future it can help others.</p><p>I have an Archer C7, and I am with Dodo NBN (Fibre) Internet.</p><p>As mentioned above the ISP required a VLAN of 100 set up on the router, I had the WAN PPPPoE over VLAN 100 set as mentioned by Sebass and it worked fine, however I can&#039;t wrap my head around how exactly to config my router to work for my ISP running the OpenWRT firmware.</p><p>Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
