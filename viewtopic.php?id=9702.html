					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have WRT54G and WAP54G, working as the nodes of the OLSR mesh network.<br />Additionally I wanted them to work as a tinc based router between two LAN segments.</p><p>The WRT54G is connected to the 172.19.1.0/24 segment (with IP 172.19.1.254)<br />The WAP54G is connected to the 172.19.4.0/24 segment (with IP 172.19.4.254)</p><p>The tun0 uses 172.19.1.254 on WRT and 172.19.4.254 on WAP with netmask 255.255.0.0</p><p>I can ping machines in the 172.19.4.0/24 segment from both WRT and WAP, however I can not <br />ping machines in the 172.19.1.0/24 segment from WAP (they are accessible from WRT though).<br />I can ping 172.19.1.254 (WRT) from WAP.</p><p>So it seems, that packets are lost between the tap0 and vlan0 in the WRT.<br />/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward is set to 1.</p><p>the &quot;ifname&quot;, and &quot;ifnames&quot; variables are set as follows:<br /># nvram show | grep ifn<br />size: 1100 bytes (31668 left)<br />wl0_ifname=eth1<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0<br />lan_ifname=vlan0<br />wifi_ifname=eth1<br />wan_ifname=eth1</p><p>UPDATE - SOLVED<br />OK. I just had to add a single line to my tinc-up script:<br /> iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o vlan0 -j ACCEPT</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wzab</strong> on 3 Mar 2007, 14:27)</p>
