					<p>I&#039;ve moved from Gargoyle firmware to plain OpenWRT+Luci and was playing with settings in WLAN/Ethernet device settings and probably kicked myself out of it. Probably some bad bridging mode or something similar.</p><p>Router with IP 192.168.1.199 is still booting but I can&#039;t ssh into it and no telnet is alvailable nor the Luci web interface.</p><p>With nmap and wireshark I could confirm that it is still booting well. My tablet and notebook show the WLAN available but can&#039;t connect to it neither with static nor dynamic IP. Ping doesn&#039;t give any response.</p><p>I can press the QSS button when the SYS LED is getting up and it starts to blink faster but it doesn&#039;t seem to be in true failsafe mode with IP 192.168.1.1 as written in the wiki.</p><p>Any idea how to get back access to it? Can I use the reset button on the back with QSS button or is there a trick to get easy access back?</p>									</div>
