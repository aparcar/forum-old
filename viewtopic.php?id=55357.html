					<p>Guide to get network scanning working with SANE on OpenWRT router<br /> - with vargalex firmware - </p><p>This is a “documentation”, how I finally got it to work, after many hours of trial &amp; error &amp; search. It is not guaranteed, that it will work for you too, but as I did not find a tutorial even as good as this one, I decided to write it.<br />Maybe it’s too detailed, but I wanted to make sure that people with close to zero linux experience can understand and do it.</p><p>The tutorial can be found here:<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWjiXK7OjjUIRXjl8z-7GQdEpzUqoUqrJOC0XcuDv6k/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWj … sp=sharing</a></p>									</div>
