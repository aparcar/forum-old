					<p>Hey guys,<br />&nbsp; I was thinking about picking up a WRT610N for my wifi AP so I can serve files off of my 500G usb drive via MediaTomb to my PS3.&nbsp; Has anyone tried this using openwrt?&nbsp; I also have a weather station that I have running off of a serial-&gt;usb interface that uploads data every minute to my weather website (<a href="http://wx.hemna.com">http://wx.hemna.com</a>) and I was planning on using the WRT610N running openwrt for this as well.&nbsp; I just need to compile a C app to read data from the serial interface, then make a curl call to a url to update the database that the weather site uses.&nbsp; Do you think this will be possible on openwrt?&nbsp; Is there a gcc compiler that ships with openwrt?</p><p>Thanks guys,<br />Walt</p>									</div>

					<p>I got MediaTomb working back last May 2008, but there is a problem:&nbsp; due to some bug (I think in the c runtime implementation, or maybe even further down) the executable will spin, consuming 100% available CPU.&nbsp; Basically a waitable timer is not waiting, but returning immediately.</p><p>I worked with the developer a couple weeks to try to fix it, but both he and I stopped persueing in.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a PS3 anymore, so it wasn&#039;t critical to me because SAMBA serves my needs otherwise.</p><p>It did work quite well save the CPU usage issue.&nbsp; The ability to tweak things to make my avi files work on PS3 was great -- I was able to play about 93% of my content (without the type remapping I could play maybe about 5%).&nbsp; A key thing about PS3 video:&nbsp; don&#039;t use GMC, dont use QPEL -- it can&#039;t play files encoded with these MPEG-4 features (alas).&nbsp; The high CPU usage meant that indexing took about 4 days to complete (over 2,000 video files, 13,000 audio).&nbsp; Should have took maybe an hour or so (based upon running media tomb on a really pokey PC I have).</p><p>The same codebase apparently works fine on NSLU2, so I really think it&#039;s either the C runtime or deeper in the kernel, wherever the waitable event mecahnism is implemented (sorry I can&#039;t recall the datails better).</p>									</div>
