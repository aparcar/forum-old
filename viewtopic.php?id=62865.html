					<p>Hi all!</p><p>I coded a tool that uses libpcap to parse the signal strengths from radiotap headers.<br />On AttitudeAdjustment, everything works fine, but on ChaosCalmer, the same code fails to parse the signal strengths (always returns 0).</p><p>The libpcap version used in AttitudeAdjustment: 1.1.1-2<br />The libpcap version used in ChaosCalmer: 1.5.3-1<br />I use TL-MR3020 as hardware.<br />Any ideas what could be a reason for this, e.g., maybe related to different packing/padding behavior?</p><p>Looking at the change log of libpcap, I could not find any related changes. Tcpdump for example works on both versions and returns the correct signal strength.</p><p>The question <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49703">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49703</a> looks similar. Unfortunately there is no answer.</p><p>Many thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>siggi42</strong> on 26 Feb 2016, 11:43)</p>

					<p>Fixed it. The problem was in my code (of course :)<br />The code did not took the header extension IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_EXT correctly into account.<br />In the ChaosCalmer version IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_EXT was set, in AttitudeAdjustment is was not.</p><p>From the documentation:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_EXT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This bit is reserved for any future extensions to the radiotap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;structure.&nbsp; A driver sets IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_EXT to extend the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it_present bitmap by another 64 bits.&nbsp; The bitmap can be extended<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by multiples of 32 bits to 96, 128, 160 bits or longer, by set-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ting IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_EXT in the extensions.&nbsp; The bitmap ends<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at the first extension field where IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_EXT is not<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;set.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
