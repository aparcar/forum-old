					<p>Hi everyone,<br />I&#039;ve bought a repeater Netgear WN3000RPv2.(openwrt)<br />I&#039;ve already done some little mod but i need help to add two bigger feature:<br />- First of all, i need outgoing requests to appear as if they were a single device even if actually come from more devices connected to the repeater. (The router connected to internet should see only one device connected to itself)<br />- less important, hide the repeater from traceroute.<br />There are some ready package that can do that or can help me to do that? If yes what packages are? How can i proceed?</p><p>If you want to download the gpl source of repeater I recommend to get the firmware version 1.0.0.24 because in the version 1.0.0.36 there isn&#039;t toolchain.</p><p>If need more info just ask.<br />Sorry for my english.<br />Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jazabrl</strong> on 30 Dec 2014, 17:08)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.<br />Onestly, I think that on WN3000RPv2 is running a modified version of openWRT. For all mod i&#039;ve done, i&#039;ve used some hint taken by this forum. (for example I&#039;ve used telnetenable and edit some code)<br />So, Assuming it is actually running openWRT, what file i have to edit? what package i need?<br />Thanks again and sorry for the wait.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can look at some files with cat e.g.<br />cat /proc/version<br />will show the build version<br />ifconfig<br />brctl show<br />explore the interfaces and bridges<br />ls /etc/config<br />if it&#039;s really a full openwrt you will have network, wireless, dhcp, and firewall configs.</p><p>Then what you&#039;d do is make a wifi client interface to match your ISP&#039;s credentials and attach it to wan, and a wifi AP interface and attach it to lan along with the ethernet.&nbsp; Like metai said, the built in NAT and firewall system will route and translate everything on your lan to look like one user of the wan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 3 Jan 2015, 04:19)</p>
