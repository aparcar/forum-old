					<p>I need something similar to the GL-B1300 though only need two NICs. <br />Does anyone know of something that is well supported by openwrt that is less costly?<br />I need several of them and the price adds up too fast.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, no special features, just two gigabit NICs like the GL-B3100 and if it has those, it will have plenty of memory and space. I get by with the glinet mt300n with lots of space/memory left and am mainly looking for a dual gigabit mini router to replace it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything dual band and GbE for much under $80, and that&#039;s the Archer C7 with its single-core MIPS.&nbsp; For $10 more the GL-B1300 looks like a lot of hardware for the price.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you don&#039;t need wifi you have opened up the possibility of Broadcom devices with unsupported wifi.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what the application is that requires GbE but also will be happy with a single core MIPS.&nbsp; Because generally you aren&#039;t going to be happy with a single core MIPS in the triple digit Mbps line speeds.</p>									</div>

					<p>Two separate network interfaces so I can connect one side to LAN, the other to the router and inspect packets in/out of the network.</p><p>That said, I think you&#039;re right, some of these mini routers have two network connections which are in fact the same network but two ports.</p>									</div>
