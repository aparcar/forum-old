					<p>That would help me a lot as well with my DSL-2741B, even though I have hardware version E1</p><p>Can I try the latest release if the Table of Hardware only lists 12.09?</p><p>If the latest release (15.05.1 currently) is not supported and I can only use 12.09, will I get security updates?</p><p>After I know which release to use, how do I know which image to download please? The wiki entry does not say anything about that...<br />Are these the CPU architectures? : adm5120/adm8668/ar7/ar71xx/at91/atheros/au1000/...<br />If so, which one to choose to use with the MIPS cpu in DSL-2741B?</p><p>Thank you for any help</p>									</div>
