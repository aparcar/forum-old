					<p>Hi,<br />usually there is a FL032PIF in a WR703N. I would like to replace the flash chip by a FL128PIF (128 Mbit / 16 MB). There are offers from China around $5 each.</p><p>What do you think about this?</p><p>muebau</p>									</div>

					<p>There is info on the WiKi about what RAM to use. I got mine off slboat (took a week or so from China). Once I have successfully desoldered and resoldered a couple of old boards, I will post pics of how I did or did not manage to replace the ram <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />It is theoretically possible without a hot-air station. But I will need to practice on something unimportant first!!<br />The Wiki link:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I researched about this few weeks ago...<br />Search on ebay, there are a lot of RAM modules where you can get the ram chips:<br />Put this on ebay search:<br />&quot;512MB ddr 333 sodimm -ddr2 -ddr3&quot;<br />and also try<br />&quot;512MB ddr 400 sodimm -ddr2 -ddr3&quot;<br />There you can get two type of ram modules, 32x16 or 64x8. You need the 32mx16.</p><p>Look into the pictures for <strong>m470l6524bt0 - cb3</strong><br />Those modules are 32Mx16, available both in 333 and 400MHz versions, but it doesn&#039;t matter as they all have 400MHz chips.<br />They&#039;re around $10 free shipping, each module has 8 x 64MB chips, that means you can upgrade 8 routers.<br />If you don&#039;t break any chip while desoldering, its a nice deal.<br />Tip: For unsoldering everything easy and safely for the chips, if you want to trip all from the board, a good way is to put a 50W halogen bulb under the module, at about 5 cm. It will start to heat and in about a minute it will have reached the 300ÂºC needed to melt the solder, then you only need to remove them with some tool, or you can give it a shake over a smooth surface, and the willl drop on it.</p>									</div>

					<p>dabyd64: did you try the halogen on this board? Seems like the traces just want to jump off!<br />I have successfully removed the RAM using low melt solder (chipquik). Cleaning the pads was a breeze, but cleaning up the removed chip was a pain.<br />I hope I can drag solder the new one first go otherwise it will be pain. Pics to follow..</p>									</div>

					<p>Of couse I didn&#039;t try the halogen method on the router board! Its almost guaranteed that you will remove something else and break it.<br />I said to use that methond only on boards in which you want to remove all the components...for example removing all the chips from the RAM module.</p>									</div>
