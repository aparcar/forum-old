					<p>Hello, I&#039;m new here, so question will be newbies too, I have a Linksys WRT1900ACS and</p><p>i) I don&#039;t know wich router I bought, because with this image say it is a &quot;V2&quot; router, but firmware is 1.0.1174588 (a V1)</p><p>paste.opensuse.org/79809863</p><p>ii) I suppose that is V2, so using kaloz firmware (15.05.1), with updated wifi drivers sometimes I get disconnections in Wireless 5ghz, and then change to 2.4 automatically.</p><p>iii) I think this is a not-so-related-openwrt question but when I start transmission bittorrent in the connection graph I have tons of UDP connections and searching here and there seems my ISP think is an attack and they disconnect me, the only thing I have to do to get PPPoE connection working again is power off/power in adsl device and router do the redial again. Transmission is configured with limited connections (almost 80, changed from 400). I say a not-so-related-openwrt question because when I connect directly my notebook with transmission client broke the connection too and need to restart adsl modem, but that thing doesn&#039;t happen with my current wrt54gl with last linksys firmware, I use transmission with it and never had problem, just one that must disable firewall in router, but until now can&#039;t get with the reason of lot of connections, all to isp dns. Is there a way to cache request in the router so dns request are returned by router?</p><p>paste.opensuse.org/54524462<br />paste.opensuse.org/2586785</p><p>iv) I&#039;ve tryed davidc52 firmware, but wireless 2.4ghz and 5ghz won&#039;t work.</p><p>This is preliminar, I still need to test more, but by time and conditions (this is my &quot;production&quot; home network, can&#039;t disconnect often) I really want to debug this issues, need to do some upgrades in my local network.</p><p>I have some backgrounds on programming, but don&#039;t know much about networks, so please guide me to tell you something useful for debug.</p><p>Sorry by my English, is not my native language.</p><p>Edit: To change partition for me work in this way: 3 times reboot power off and on again, but when some lights tilt and after that power light (first light left to right) is on and then off then switch power off device and then power on again... repeat 3 times.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>feathersanddown</strong> on 6 Oct 2016, 00:19)</p>

					<p><strong>@Ansuel</strong> Driver is fine, and while there have been issues that pop up from time to time, I haven&#039;t seen any posts as of late regarding issues with the wifi driver.&nbsp; All AC routers must support N by default, as each iteration of wifi is backwards compatible with all previous versions. </p><p>In terms of AC routers, unless you require more than 2 radios (i.e. more than one 5gHz radio] or MU-MIMO, the WRT1X00AC/S Series is one of the best, if not the best, in terms of a high performance router that fully supports open source firmware, and is reasonably affordable (especially when you can pick up a WRT1200 for $100 on Newegg, and occasionally the ACS for ~$170 - $200).&nbsp; </p><p>If you&#039;d like to exceed the performance and gain a higher level of customization, you could build your own router box for ~$350 and run a router OS, such as Sophos UTM or pfSense (while you could run OpenWrt, the&nbsp; x86_x64 platform lacks a lot of the the packages that can be installed on ARM devices).&nbsp; Depending on the server board bought, once could run multiple WiFi cards if more than two radios are required, as well as gaining a quad or octa core processor (Intel Atom C2558 [15w]/C2758 [20w] SOC was manufactured specifically with networking in mind, albeit not all router OSes utilize it&#039;s enhancements for network traffic; a J1900 is another popular SOC).</p>									</div>
