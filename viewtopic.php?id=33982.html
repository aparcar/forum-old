					<p>So I&#039;ve been attempting to build backfire 10.03 from tags (using official config file + netem added) on an openSuSE 12.1 (x86_64) system for many hours here.&nbsp; Been running into several issues that are due to the x86_64 architecture or due to the levels of software that are included in openSuSE 12.1.&nbsp; I&#039;m working through them and seems I&#039;m not the first to try this so all the issues so far have been discovered and fixed in trunk.&nbsp; </p><p>However, it begs the question, what are the official openwrt build systems in terms of OS level and CPU architecture?&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m betting I could have had a build system at that level up in way less time that I&#039;ve spent debugging these issues for my openSuSE 12.1 build. Not to mention I could have built the code without having to change any of it (so far just make files) since I was trying to setup a build root that I can custom build modules like netem if I need them.</p>									</div>

					<p>i did have some kind of same problem.

					<p>Hi atuel,</p><p>as it turnes out its a different story if you do cross-compile or not.</p><p>I di hve no issues build Openwrt on Ubuntu 11-64 / 32 on VMWare, but run into problems in cross-compiling for atheros / mpis.<br />The reason is , that in&nbsp; cross-compiling all the buildoot (compiler,tools..) is different.<br />So on one package it is ok if build for natixe x86, the other time failes in cross compiling.</p><p>regards</p><p>3zl</p>									</div>

					<p>vi Thanks for that info... </p><p>I actually got backfire 10.03 to compile successfully... even with netem.&nbsp; Too bad I forgot the .1 as I&#039;m running backfire 10.03.1 on my router right now, so off to do it again.&nbsp; Good thin I realised the kernel levels on the kmod_netem were different than I had running before I tried to install it.&nbsp; </p><p>Just to veirfy, providing the 10.03.1 level builds completely, any issue in teneral with taking only the netem package out and putting it on top of the official build?</p>									</div>
