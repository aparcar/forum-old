					<p>Hi,<br />first of all i want to say thanks to everybody who is contributing to the OpenWRT Projekt. Now my problem:</p><p>Some time ago i got an original Atheros AP30 (AR5BAP) reference design device (don&#039;t ask where i got it from).<br />It has a AR5312A, an SST 39VF1601 and some Marvell Chip for the switch on board. The EJtag Pins are also populated. When i try to power it on it seems to do some self testing and then it ends up with a flashing power led.<br />I tried to connect via some common ip&#039;s, but this didn&#039;t work.<br />So I decided to connect via self made parallel port JTAG cable.<br />After some fails i got the jtag tools working - at least to the point when i want to read or write something.<br />Here is my JTAG Script (including definintions from ar2312):</p><p>cable parallel 0x378 DLC5<br />detect<br />register BR 1<br />register BSR 1<br />register DIR 32<br />register EJIMPCODE 32<br />register EJADDRESS 32<br />register EJDATA 32<br />register EJCONTROL 32<br />register EJALL 96<br />register EJFASTDATA 33<br />instruction length 5<br />instruction BYPASS 11111 BR<br />instruction SAMPLE/PRELOAD 00010 BSR<br />instruction IDCODE 00001 DIR<br />instruction EJTAG_IMPCODE 00011 EJIMPCODE<br />instruction EJTAG_ADDRESS 01000 EJADDRESS<br />instruction EJTAG_DATA 01001 EJDATA<br />instruction EJTAG_CONTROL 01010 EJCONTROL<br />instruction EJTAG_ALL 01011 EJALL<br />instruction EJTAGBOOT 01100 BR<br />instruction NORMALBOOT 01101 BR<br />instruction EJTAG_FASTDATA 01110 EJFASTDATA<br />initbus ejtag<br />endian big<br />poke 0x58400000 0x100e3ce1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;-- everything works untill this point</p><p>First jtag tools complained about &quot;Failed to enter debug mode&quot; which i could compensate when trying to connect shortly after hard resetting the device.<br />Now it shows &quot;No processor access, ctrl=00000000011000001100000000001000&quot; after every command (the values after ctrl change from time to time). detectflash won&#039;t work either.</p><p>Now my questions are: What i have to poke/peek to get to the flash through the AR5312? Which are the addresses and ranges for the bootloader and normal flash?</p><p>I also tried Hairydairymaid&#039;s unbrick tools, but it gets stuck at &quot;probing flash at 0x1f....&quot; or &quot;manual flash selection&quot; when selecting the flash with /fc:47. Also setting the window to 0xbe... doesn&#039;t work out.</p><p>thx in advance</p><p>Thomas</p>									</div>
