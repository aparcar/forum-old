					<p>All m2, m5 and nanobridge devices which came to my hand had tftp recovery, so I&#039;m almost sure your device is tftp capable too. Btw. I use original ubnt firmware on my external links, because they are imo better.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I already have tried to access it in TFTP mode, the LEDs were flashing the right way, but I had no acces to the device in normal AND in TFTP mode... so I supposed it was DOA and returned it to the reseller for repairing or hopefully replacement, as they said... still waiting though, returned it 2 weeks ago...</p><p>I want to make my device a repeater... so it &quot;grabs&quot; a wireless and re-produces it in a new network... I do not think it is possible with AirOS... not if I do not connect a wireless router after it...</p><p>I had a TP-LINK CPE210 and it HAD &quot;Repeater&quot; and &quot;Bridge&quot; wireless modes, but airOS isn&#039;t that way.</p><p>BTW what you meant &quot;on your external links&quot; ... you mean &quot;Outdoor devices&quot; , right ? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>I can&#039;t give you a &quot;normal link&quot;, but i am gonna give you a short one, to the Ubiquiti Community with my topic, to see the symptoms which my device showed: goo.gl/ yCfTf6 ( just remove the spacing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ) ...</p><p>Thanks for the reply !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>InstantFreeman</strong> on 7 Jan 2018, 19:38)</p>

					<p>TFTP mode: get lights blinking, set static IP on your PC, then TFTP to the device at 192.168.1.20.</p><p>Beware of flashing new version ubnt firmwares as they may install a locked bootloader.</p><p>A single radio repeater mode doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense unless your users will also be out in front of the dish.</p>									</div>
