If you are getting disconnected when you turn of the &#039;lan&#039; interface, the odds are good that you are connecting to the system through that interface.</p><p>but you say you are connecting through switch port 0, which this config puts on vlan4, or the 10.10.40.0/24 network</p><p>you have defined 4 of the 5 ports on the switch to be something other than the default, are you sure you are connecting to port 0, not port 4?</p><p>IIRC, on this router, eth0 on the system connects to port 5 on the switch and eth1 connects to port 6, you define a lot of eth0.x interfaces, but your bridge settings all connect them to port 6</p><p>it&#039;s almost certinly just a matter that you aren&#039;t using the ports/interfaces that you think you are.</p>									</div>
