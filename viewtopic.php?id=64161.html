					<p>So I am used to DD-WRT, and I liked it simply because it was GUI based.&nbsp; Well it isn&#039;t compatible for my router but openwrt is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve literally read about linux but haven&#039;t really used it that much.</p><p>In any case, I follow the wiki.&nbsp; First I need to set up DDNS.&nbsp; I could of sworn there was a GUI version of openwrt on youtube, but I couldn&#039;t find it.&nbsp; In any case, I install the packages that I need, and then I SSH into the router, and start configuring the DDNS config file.&nbsp; It got to a point where it asked me to restart the process in order for the process to use the newly configured file.&nbsp; I did write changes to the file.&nbsp; I googled linux commands to do this, but the ls command didn&#039;t work, and somehow I got the ps command to work.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t see a DDNS process at all.&nbsp; So, I saved the config file, disconnected the ssh connection, and decided to reboot the router by power.&nbsp; Well, it bricked the router for a little while.&nbsp; I was pissed.&nbsp; But then the router came back to life, and I was very happy, however everything is set to when I first installed openwrt.&nbsp; The packages are gone, which means the config file is gone.&nbsp; So now I have to do everything all over again.</p><p>I am presuming what I did wrong was the power down power on.&nbsp; But my question is, why did that kind of brick my router?&nbsp; Some commands on the internet don&#039;t work on the router, like ls.&nbsp; I did the ps command, and the process didn&#039;t show up, so how do I restart the ps process?&nbsp; If it was there, how do I restart it?&nbsp; I know the kill processid command, but I don&#039;t know how to start the process back up.</p><p>Finally, is there a gui version of openwrt?&nbsp; IF there is, would it be compatible to upgrade it from the other rt version?&nbsp; (I am presuming it will)</p><p>It&#039;s really intimidating setting up DDNS, and a VPN using command line.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even a linux user that much.&nbsp; Are the wiki&#039;s up to date?&nbsp; The only thing I know to do is to just follow the wiki as best I can.</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>									</div>

					<p>What Router are you talking about ?<br />Some routers don&#039;t have enough flash to install LuCI (the GUI).<br />What OpenWrt Version are you talking about ?<br />The ls command is basic and should work the same for ps command.<br />If this commands are not working you have basic problems with your software installed on the router.<br />You first need to fix this problems before going on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Like chris5560 mentioned, you really don&#039;t provide anything to go by - but luci-app-ddns ships the ddns implementation for luci (and the wiki is o.k.).</p>									</div>
