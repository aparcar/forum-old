					<p>I was looking into the same issue I&#039;m having. Since 4.1 is using a new type of authentication method, I can&#039;t get into it with this build of snort.</p><p>At first I saw your idea about configuring the server, but a google search showed a bunch of other snort users having the same problem.

					<p>Ok, first off, Nico, I do appricate your help on this.&nbsp; I have to admit that I am a bit of an elitist snob when it comes to IDS systems and such.&nbsp; Personally I&#039;m much more in favor of the heavy, bloated solution of a managed ( foundry/cisco/compaq/etc... ) switch with one or more 1U servers managing everything.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just me, and like I said, I&#039;m all about the elitist snob thing, so try not to take that personally.</p><p>Anyhoo, here is why I think this is a client library problem and not just me being a moron and not having the server conf&#039;d right:</p><p>When I change the username to something that I know won&#039;t work I get:<br />ERROR: database: mysql_error: Access denied for user &#039;n0rt&#039;@&#039;10.0.1.1&#039; (using password: YES)<br />Which tells me that the access denied problem is coming back fine.</p><p>Getting the other error that I mentioned before leads me to believe that authentication does work since I&#039;ve tested the account on another box that has the 4.1.x libs and it does in fact work.&nbsp; So, I know the authentication works, I know the account is solid, I know that on some level the authentication from the WRT box to the server does work, but isn&#039;t finishing.&nbsp; </p><p>My only conclusion in this matter is that the static libs that snort was compiled with are not the upgraded libs that are required for the newer ( 4.1 ) series authentication mechs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve checked various boards and postings via google searches and that seems to be the general concent umong the public.&nbsp; All of this information together with the error message itself ( &quot;Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client&quot; ) makes me think that it is the libraries that are causing the problem.</p><p>Again, thanks for any help you or anyone else can provide, much appriciated.</p>									</div>

If I&#039;m on the route to MySQL5, is the legacy password hack going to still work?

I can understand if you don&#039;t have time to build it...
