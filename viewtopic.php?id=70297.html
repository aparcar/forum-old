					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I have been having issues with nmap doing reverse DNS lookups for hostnames when I do a network scan. On some networks the DNS resolutions works, on others it does not. So I saw in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; there were kernal modules named &quot;kmod-dnsresolver&quot; and &quot;kmod-dns-resolver&quot;. </p><p>How do I make use of these packages? Is there a way to use these resolvers over whatever is being used currently? I can&#039;t find any documentation on these packages or how to use them.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK &quot;kmod-dnsresolver&quot; and &quot;kmod-dns-resolver&quot; won&#039;t help you. First they depend on a (working) DNS resolver in user space, and second they can&#039;t be used directly by user space programs (like nmap) anyway. Those modules are useful together with CIFS and AFS when resolving host names.</p>									</div>
