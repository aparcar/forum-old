					<p>Dear friends<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I am a beginner and i am facing some problem in reflashing my bullet2 device .<br />I have read in some of the readme.txt that we should have .trx file to reflash from the bullet itself.<br />(<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/00-README">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/00-README</a>)<br />But could you please help me telling how to generate the .trx file.</p><p>I am using OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 and i have compiled and made the binary file &quot;openwrt-atheros-ubnt2-squashfs.bin&quot;.<br />I have loaded it using tftp and it is working fine.<br />But i don&#039;t know how to get the .trx file for reflashing.</p><p>Since our bullets will be on the roof-tops, i have to remotely reflash it.</p><p>Could you please help me in this.</p><p>Thanks<br />Johns</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johnsgeorge</strong> on 5 Oct 2010, 14:22)</p>

					<p>I dont have an exact answer for you but I think you should start reading the difference between trx and bin<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12248">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12248</a> is just one of the threads<br />in one line short the bin file has a header of 32 bytes while compared to a trx.<br />you can usually convert a bin to trx by stripping off the header which I just talked about</p>									</div>

					<p>well that was just an example.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> dd if=firmware.bin of=firmware.trx bs=32 skip=1</code></pre></div><p>is one trick to get the first 32 skipped.<br />A .trx file is simply a firmware image in &quot;raw&quot; format with no<br />extraneous vendor-specific wrapper info </p><p>for your particular platform you need to check if its supported by kamikaze or backfire (better the latest one).<br />the above command should work. <br />for older versions it used to be like this<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r write filename.trx linux</code></pre></div><p>thats what I can recall from the back of my brain.</p><p>may be somebody with more knowledge on your platform can help you out if this does not work.</p>									</div>

					<p>When i tried &quot;mtd -r write openwrt-atheros-ubnt2-squashfs.trx linux&quot;, i am getting the following errors</p><p>&quot;Could not open mtd device: linux<br />Can&#039;t open device for writing!&quot;</p><p>I tried with .bin also.

Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot;</p><p>I tried to upload the .trx file because it was mentioned in some of the forums. Then i tried with the .bin file also. Both didn&#039;t work.</p><p>How can us ensure that if we discard the first 32 bytes from .bin file , we are getting a .trx file.</p><p>So i was not able to use the mtd command or the web interface to reflash my bullet.</p><p>It would be a great help if some one can help me to reflash my bullet.<br />(I am able to flash it using tftp.

					<p>I got the solution for my problem and i have explained it below</p><p>When we make the binaries using the command &quot;make&quot; (or make V=99), <br />openwrt-atheros-combined.squashfs.img will be created in /bin/atheros/ along with other binaries.</p><p>copy this to the /tmp folder in the router, and execute the command <br />&quot;sysupgrade openwrt-atheros-combined.squashfs.img &quot;</p><p>I have attached the logs which i got after executing&nbsp; the command</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/tmp# /sbin/sysupgrade openwrt-atheros-combined.squashfs.img<br />Saving config files...<br />Switching to ramdisk...<br />mount: mounting mini_fo:/jffs on /mnt failed: Function not implemented<br />Performing system upgrade...<br />Unlocking kernel ...<br />Unlocking rootfs ...<br />Writing from &lt;stdin&gt; to kernel ...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Writing from &lt;stdin&gt; to rootfs ...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Appending jffs2 data from /tmp/sysupgrade.tgz to rootfs...<br />Updating FIS table... <br />Rebooting ...</p><p>Now once the router is up after the reboot, you will be able to connect to it using the ip you have configured or else with 192.168.1.1</p><p>You can also upgrade the firmware from the web browser <a href="http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=.........................../admin/system/upgrade/">http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/luci/;stok … m/upgrade/</a><br />Just browse and select the openwrt-atheros-combined.squashfs.img file.<br />It will upgrade and reboot.
