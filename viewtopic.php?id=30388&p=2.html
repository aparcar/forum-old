					<p>Sorry to resurrect this ancient thread. I tried installing OpenWRT on my WPN824N rev.1 router. I pulled the code from here <a href="https://github.com/guilhem/openwrt-wpn824n">https://github.com/guilhem/openwrt-wpn824n</a>, which appears to be some trunk version with the patch by MBS/Spudz76, included in this thread. I am new to OpenWRT and there is precious little information on WPN824N so I am not sure if it is supported in trunk.</p><p>My experience is pretty similar to most people who posted to the thread. Namely, I uploaded the firmware using the web interface. Everything seemed to go OK: the firmware updater recognized the image as OpenWRT version x.x.x and did its loading bar, &quot;wait 3 minutes for update&quot;, etc., dance. However, when the router came back up after reboot it got stuck in the testing stage with power and check mark leds lit.</p><p>I then took it apart and hooked up a serial console to see if it was a total goner. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it actually got as far as booting the kernel but panicked unable to mount the root filesystem. Here is the full console output:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Oct 16 2009 - 19:04:09)

					<p>I will publish my patchset, but preferably after tests of basic functionality have been successful. The lack of Luci and a http-daemon is quite normal, as it is not selected by default in trunk builds. DHCP server however should be provided with dnsmasq.<br />You mention, that only 2 ethernet ports are coming up. It is supposed to be, that one ethernet interface is directly connected to the WAN port, while the other one is connected to the internal switch. So, please check with swconfig if that part is working properly. So far, I only had a LED definition for LAN4, so please confirm this one turns on if a device is connected and flashing to indicate data transfer.<br />Does the detected MAC adress match with the one printed on the bottom sticker?<br />Please test if LED definitions match. In /sys/class/leds/ you should find 8 directory entries corresponding to some of the devices LEDs. Inside those directories, please issue </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo 1 &gt; brightness</code></pre></div><p> and check that the LED lights up (or echo 0 to turn it off).<br />I am still missing the GPIO numbers corresponding to some LEDs (at least for LAN1, LAN2 and LAN3). Please test all GPIOs as described <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.gpio#software">here in the wiki</a>.<br />And finally, please test wifi.</p>									</div>

					<p>About the first question: no, VLAN is not related to WLAN. Please check wikipedia for an explaination of VLAN, it would be too off-topic in here.<br />WLAN however is disabled by default in openwrt, but this page will get you started: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a></p>									</div>

					<p>OK, to have a quick conclusion of this first version, what do you consider working properly (or more important: what needs improvement)?<br />* WAN port (brought up by default, should receive config by DHCP)<br />* LAN ports (connected to switch, set to 192.168.1.1 by default, switch set up to exchange data between all LAN ports and the LAN ethernet interface)<br />* WLAN (disabled by default, bridged to LAN ports)<br />* MAC adresses - OK?<br />* LEDs (all of the devices LEDs set up properly) - OK?<br />* Buttons (all of the devices Buttons configured)</p>									</div>
