					<p>Hi,</p><p>thanks for the reply.</p><p>Probably will try option 3, getting a snapshot. But then two questions come to my mind:</p><p>- How stable are these snapshots?<br />- When I flash from the command line via wget and mtd, will my configurations be lost or should flash from the web-interface to save the configurations and reinstall needed packages for psk2 and ddns?</p><p>Best Regards<br />hans</p>									</div>
