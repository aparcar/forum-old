					<p>Yesterday I managed to switch back to stock firmware.</p><p>But it was a real pain!</p><p>I am now god expert enough to get a tftp-server running on my Ubuntu 14.04, so I had to find another way.<br />I decided to upload the image to my could and wget it through a share-link to the router. Didn&#039;t work!<br />Then I took the image and uploadet it to an ftp-server on my tablet, after the pc denied to access the same type of ftp-server on my phone. I was to able to download the image from the tablet to&nbsp; /tmp on the router. Then I used sysupgrade.<br />Now stock runs again!</p><p>The wifi was VERY unstable with openwrt. Not only the range, but also it was a big problem to get the image with wget transferred to the router. The tranferred stalled after about 90-95%. I tried it several times. Then I issued the -c option an still needed a view attempts to get the image transferred.</p><p>In the past I never had this kind of problems with my wifi.</p><p>I think this openwrt still need some work to be done, to run stable. To me it seems like the difference between V9 an V10 is more than expected.</p><p>But nevertheless I thank you revosftw for your work!</p>									</div>

					<p>Good morning open-source-heros (-:</p><p><em>(i really mean that, in times where my castrated ISP router has more influence to my network then myself, people working on alternatives without charging money for it are just heros! same goes for GNU/Linux in genral + this is the proof that development and engenieering spirit is not bound to the laws of neoliberal market economy)</em></p><p><strong>1. openWRT on 4mb device and the (more) efforts</strong></p><p>besides the simple fact, that &quot;more efforts&quot;&nbsp; means more chance to learn things and isn&#039;t something negativ in this context, let me bring back to our mind that the pretty super easy and effortless way of installing the provided v9 from revosftw of chaos calmer plus the sysupgrade from roytam1 worked perfect for me <strong>with LuCi</strong>!<br />Btw: Thanks revosftw and roytam1 for your work.</p><p>And that is just point and click. I have to admit though that i&#039;m not sure if all the functions are working, but the install itself with LuCi worked fine.</p><br /><p>Also the &quot;downgrade&quot; to the original (stripped) TPLink firmware per SSH worked flawlessly in my case, more than twice (-:<br />(i used the &quot;mtd -r write tplink.bin&quot; firmware&nbsp; way)</p><p>Btw: the failsafe mode of&nbsp; TL-WR841N V10 works beautifull too :-)</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>tritonmole wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>But I found the wifi beeing VERY unstable!</p></blockquote></div><p>That really would be a dealbreaker for me too, but i&#039;m going to test that.

Thanks for pointing in that direction. My download of a 64bit debian derivate has just finished, so i&#039;m about to jump into that next little adventure :-) In our case i assume that the syntax would be something like :</p><p><span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></span><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make image PROFILE=TLWR841 PACKAGES=&quot;luci-base&quot;

(edit2: i falsely used the wiki linked imagebuilder file, instead of the trunk snapshot one, which works with v10 i guess - i&#039;ll report if im done with that new test)

Thats the filenames:

openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841nd-v9-squashfs-factory.bin 3.8mb
openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v9-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin 3.1mb

So it&#039;s all about the selection of the pakets here i think, but interestingly did the didn&#039;t the &quot;full&quot;LuCi fit on the v9 from the beginning of this thread too?</code></pre></div><p>That may in addition be interresting to me because i could add ebtables then, which i don&#039;t know if i need them for my &quot;hardware-firewall&quot;, but maybe woth a try (-:</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>ttraj wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>and i try to build my own with ArchLinux i ended up in error</p></blockquote></div><p>maaan, the Bruce Lee OS on my router, would be fantastic, guess i wouldn&#039;t need a GUI then at all :-)</p><br /><p>so, have fun everybody and see you later.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zoon</strong> on 15 Nov 2015, 23:25)</p>

					<p><strong>@jamest42:</strong></p><p>Great, ty for your efforts on this!<br />Does that mean after the install of the compiled version would be space left on the device ?
