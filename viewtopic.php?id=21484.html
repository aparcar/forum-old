					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m trying to compile for a Fonera and have got my head around using the dev system</p><p>I&#039;ve even downloaded it and think I&#039;ve compiled correctly a standard 8.09.1 build, however I want to compile to include nfs (so have chosen the kmod-fs-nfs option using the Y key to include it in the build - i.e. not as a package) is this correct?&nbsp; Does it automatically select any required dependencies?</p><p>I also want to compile to include some apps, for example htop and x-wrt and also want to include some patches.</p><p>I&#039;m afraid this is where I&#039;m getting confused as the information on the wiki and some other locations seem to be in conflict and I can&#039;t tell which ones are up to date.</p><p>Could someone possible advise me...</p><p>1.&nbsp; How do I add &#039;other&#039; packages to the build.</p><p>2.&nbsp; Do I have to manually ensure any &#039;other&#039; packages dependencies are included or does the package itself take care of that?</p><p>3.&nbsp; How do I add patches to the &#039;other&#039; packages.</p><p>Thanks in advance and sorry to ask such basic questions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Selecting Y on the module means that it will be built into the firmware file, selecting M makes it a package which is installed with OPKG.</p><p>1) use the feeds program&nbsp; &nbsp;./scripts/feeds update&nbsp; &nbsp; then&nbsp; &nbsp; ./scripts/feeds search xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; then ./scripts/feeds install xxx<br />the installed components should then be in your options when you do:&nbsp; &nbsp; make menuconfig</p><p>2) Should be added, but you will usually get compile errors if you are missing something. compile with V=99 if you hit one, check the config.log file</p>									</div>

					<p>OK This now gets a little more complicated.......</p><p>I want to compile to include the latest version of Kismet (i.e. the 2009 version).</p><p>The package on Openwrt is the 2008 version but there&#039;s a patch file here...</p><p><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2009-July/004702.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 04702.html</a></p><p>However that diff refers to pkg_release version 2 and it fails if implemented against the package currently in svn.</p><p>There is on x-wrt dev a version of the 2009 file here....</p><p><a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/snapshots/atheros/packages/">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz … /packages/</a></p><p>However this appears to be the binary and I can&#039;t find a source for it (also I&#039;m not sure how to implement pulling that source, and pulling it without conflicting with the existing source version on openwrt).&nbsp; I realise I could just pull the binary and install it as a package but really want to generate a build that includes everything I want as standard.</p><p>Some guidance how to solve this would be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
