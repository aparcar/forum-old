					<p>I find it interesting, although not useful, that there is a functioning halt command in Kamikaze.&nbsp; I found it by accident when I was typing halt in the wrong terminal window and hmmmm..... good thing that router was not remote from me.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t think of a way to restart it without cycling power.&nbsp; Perhaps I am missing something though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like a command that really shouldn&#039;t be there...&nbsp; A symlink from halt to reboot should be what you&#039;d want instead.</p>									</div>
