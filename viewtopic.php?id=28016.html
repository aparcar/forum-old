					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I&#039;ve got KAMIKAZE installed on a asus wl-520gu</p><p>I have configured my router as per the example here <a href="http://tinkernut.com/archives/2387">http://tinkernut.com/archives/2387</a></p><p>I am using the 192.168.1.x range on my network</p><p>I have a wifi router that the asus router attaches to, it can ping this router via wireless when I&#039;m connected via a cable on the port 1 on the asus router (i set it to 192.168.1.45)</p><p>in the example the presenter sets up the wifi and network settings, as I have done, and I connect to the wifi network with the asus router, but when I reboot the router I&#039;m not able to ssh into the asus router or even ping it, (this is from a laptop connecting to the wireless network via the same router (not the asus one))</p><p>I do notice that he sets the routers port to the ip address in the network settings, on my main router I can see my asus router has connected via wifi, and has a different ip (like 192.168.1.253), if I try to ping this ip or ssh into it both are blocked</p><p>Where am I going wrong:</p><p>should the wl0 port be configured with a static ip address?<br />does openwrt block ping, and external ssh connections via wifi?<br />how do I configure the router to act like a simple client, but be able to allow the ports to be used so that computers can connect to it to get internet?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Darren</p>									</div>
