					<p>I have seen posts referring to the EOC5610 running openwrt, but it isn&#039;t included in the supported hardware doc. Is this supported? Does anybody have one running openwrt?</p><p>Engenius and Atheros do not seem to be well supported. Is there a reason for this? As I understand it Atheros is superior to Broadcom so I&#039;m confused about the lack of support for the chipsets. Can someone enlighten me, please?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

So, you asked the question, and I delivered the answer. That&#039;s the point. FYI, I have other devices on other platforms that out performed Atheros, too. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>In general Atheros is considered better than Broadcom from what my research shows.</p></blockquote></div><p>May be or may be not. I don&#039;t claim either. All I did was to fulfill your question. If you are not happy with my answer, please move on.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>It looks like your Broadcom is a newer chipset since you are overclocking the Atheros.</p></blockquote></div><p>That remains to be proven, not by me. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>And perhaps the overclocking is slowing down the Atheros because of errors?</p></blockquote></div><p>Without overclocking, my FON2100 performs even slower the my WGT634U. So, overclocking really makes my FON2100 performs faster. Just don&#039;t take my words on this, get yourself this mediocre FON2100 and see it for yourself.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>My intention is not to argue the merits of one over the other.

Perhaps, you need to re-word your post to make it more clear.</p>									</div>
