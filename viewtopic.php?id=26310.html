					<p>Hi, I&#039;m a noob and I&#039;ve done something stupid. I installed OpenWRT succesfully on my TP-LINK 1043ND, but after having no internet signal, I selected &#039;DHCP&#039; and clicked Save and Apply. The router rebooted and... just like that... I had no connection to the router.</p><p>It doesn&#039;t give an IP address now, the PC does not recognize the router whatsoever. The only IP I got, was 192.168.137.1 for the computer, with no gateway IP, so I can&#039;t access it anymore.</p><p>Tried the 30-30-30 reset, still nothing. Does someone know how to fix this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey LeonTan, thanks for the tip. Unfortunately I get a time-out. I tried the following and came close to accessing the router; I connected my PC to WAN and started up DHCP server on PC, giving address 192.168.1.1 to the router.</p><p>After that I gave the PC IP address 192.168.1.2 and tried accessing using telnet, but still ..... nothing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Eventhough your router is bricked, but if it is still running with firewall, WAN interfaces do not accept packets coming in. </p><p>If I am not mistaken, /etc/config/firewall file states so.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>/etc/config/firewall wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>config &#039;zone&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;input&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>What about on the LAN interface? Set a static IP address of 192.168.1.2.</p><p>Then try reflashing the router. Had to get the timing right. I assume you didn&#039;t set the nvram boot_wait and boot_time parameters. It will be harder.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks! I finally reset the router, appears the cable was the problem (Cat6).</p><p>Now the big question is; how to get my original firmware on it. Once again, I&#039;m a newb, so uboot or mtd are new terms for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />.. is there an &#039;easy&#039; way?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can do a telnet to your router right ? </p><p>You should be able to do it easily enough with just a normal TFTP. </p><p>Follow the steps : -&gt; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/linksys/wrt54gl#using.the.linksys.web.gui">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt â€¦ ys.web.gui</a></p><p>This is for WRT54GL. I think it should work for you too because TFTP and web interface are basically general things. </p><p>Remember to set your router&#039;s IP address to 192.168.1.1.</p><p>If not you can try the Web Interface. It&#039;s much more simpler.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LeonTan</strong> on 29 Aug 2010, 16:49)</p>
