					<p>Hello guys.<br />First of all I am really new to this so beware if I say some kind of nonsense. I have installed OpenWrt on my Ubiquiti AirRouter (FW v5.6.2). I followed this guide:<br />wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/airrouter<br />And used this firmware to flash:<br />downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-squashfs-factory.bin<br />Everything went well, the firmware has been installed but when my router restarted I couldn&#039;t login to 192.168.1.1 via web. I understand that you call this &quot;admin panel&quot; as LuCi. I tried to search for some info about it and I&#039;ve stumbled a topic that not all builds has LuCi installed and that I have to do it myself via telnet or ssh. So I tried that but failed because I can&#039;t connect. I am using macOS so I headed to my system preferences -&gt; network and saw that I don&#039;t have any IP assigned to my router (what I can see is only IP Address: 169.254.212.1 and Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0). So I&#039;ve tried manually changing my IP to 192.168.1.2 and router IP to 192.168.1.1. Still nothing. I also tried pinging 192.168.1.1 but got a message &quot;no route to host&quot;. Oh and I used terminal for telnet, ssh connections and also pinging.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s helpful, I&#039;ve tried to tell everything. I really wish you could help me with my problem. Hope I didn&#039;t brick my router.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>EDIT: my router&#039;s lights are flashing like normal. And it doesn&#039;t matter if I connect my ethernet to LAN or WAN port, I still get the same IP assigned.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kash</strong> on 23 Feb 2017, 13:21)</p>

If you mean my computer by that - it is fine, I use another router and everything works fine. I had this one laying around and I just wanted to make it work as a WiFi repeater for my sister because the signal is weak in her room. That was my main intention <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Anyway, I have tried to manually set my IP address to 192.168.1.2 and router&#039;s to 192.168.1.1 and I could ping myself (192.168.1.2) but no luck with the router&#039;s IP. When trying to do that I did get a different message than before - it was &quot;no route to host&quot; before and now I get &quot;host is down&quot;.

When I connect my WAN cable to the WAN port and when i connect my macbook to the LAN port those lights show up. So I can get to 3 lights on the router - LAN, WAN and power. As for the macbook - yes, I&#039;m sure because if I plug in my WAN cable straight to the macbook using the same adapter I get the assigned IP and internet works fine, but when I plug the cable going from this router to my macbook it self assigns the IP, because it can&#039;t get one from the router.
