					<p>I have a number of scripts in /etc/init.d/ that aren&#039;t loading at bootup on my WNDR3700v2.&nbsp; The script doesn&#039;t seem to work on bootup or reset of the router.&nbsp; I tried the following commands in various combinations:</p><p>chmod +x /etc/init.d/tmount<br />/etc/init.d/tmount enable</p><p>There are entries within /etc/rc.d for the script to be loaded at S99tmount.&nbsp; &nbsp;So it is being &quot;enabled&quot; on bootup.&nbsp; There are other scripts to start samba etc. but I suspect none of those are being executed on bootup.</p><p>I tried modifying the script to execute at different points&nbsp; START = 59, START = 9 etc.&nbsp; Any amount of changes I make doesn&#039;t execute the script on startup.&nbsp; I found a script for /etc/rC.S which is supposed to execute the &quot;S&quot; startup scripts in /etc/rc.d/&nbsp; but i&#039;m not sure if its working properly at this point.</p><p>what can I do to fix this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Since you&#039;re able to access the router, the statement &quot;/etc/init.d/ doesn&#039;t work&quot; is obviously wrong, logic dictates that the fault is within your script then - and since you didn&#039;t post the contents of it, nobody can help you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Assuming your script works (we&#039;ll get to that in a second), after you&#039;ve run &quot;/etc/init.d/tmount enable&quot; do you see a symlink in /etc/rc.d named S59tmount or something similar, with whatever number you set in the script?</p><p>Second - does your script work? In a running system, any script in /etc/init.d should work, such as &quot;/etc/init.d/telnet status&quot; - does your script do what you want if you type &quot;/etc/init.d/tmount start&quot; and then &quot;/etc/init.d/tmount status&quot;?</p>									</div>
