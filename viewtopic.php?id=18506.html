I also thought i would try to see if i could get the vpnc to work and function so i only had to deal with 1 router and network at home.</p><p>The config file i am using. Is this (keep in mind i censored the ip and pre-share-key):</p><p>IPSec gateway XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />IPSec ID <br />IPSec secret presharekey<br />IKE Authmode psk<br />Xauth username <br />Xauth password </p><p>When i run vpnc with this config file i get &quot;vpnc: no response from target&quot; error message. Then i log on to the 3000 series concetrator i see this in the logs (keep in mind i censored the IPs):</p><p>10130 01/19/2009 10:25:10.540 SEV=4 IKE/105 RPT=45 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Zero length data in ID payload received during phase 1 processing</p><p>10131 01/19/2009 10:25:10.540 SEV=4 IKE/48 RPT=49 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Error processing payload: Payload ID: 5</p><p>10132 01/19/2009 10:25:11.550 SEV=4 IKE/105 RPT=46 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Zero length data in ID payload received during phase 1 processing</p><p>10133 01/19/2009 10:25:11.550 SEV=4 IKE/48 RPT=50 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Error processing payload: Payload ID: 5</p><p>10134 01/19/2009 10:25:13.560 SEV=4 IKE/105 RPT=47 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Zero length data in ID payload received during phase 1 processing</p><p>10135 01/19/2009 10:25:13.560 SEV=4 IKE/48 RPT=51 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Error processing payload: Payload ID: 5</p><p>10136 01/19/2009 10:25:17.570 SEV=4 IKE/105 RPT=48 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Zero length data in ID payload received during phase 1 processing</p><p>10137 01/19/2009 10:25:17.570 SEV=4 IKE/48 RPT=52 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX<br />Error processing payload: Payload ID: 5</p><br /><p>What do i have run in the config file or could be missing int he concentrator?
