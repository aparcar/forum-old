					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve been trying to connect the TI with the Glinet using the gpio using <a href="hxxps://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.i2c">hxxps://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.i2c</a></p><p>I&#039;ve installed using okpg the i2c gpio custom and core modules without issue. When doing &quot;dmesg | grep gpio&quot; I get ports 19 and 20 for SDA/SCL and connect them accordingly using soldered lines. The ethernet port is set to forwarding according to dmesg | tails. However when running i2cdetect -l on my laptop connected directly to the router LAN via ethernet I do not see the ADS1115. Is there something I specifically have to do to make the chip visible? Does the kernel in hxxps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/hwmon/ads1015.c need special loading onto the router?</p><p>Here&#039;s the setup on imgur: [img]hxxps://imgur.com/a/OfoUc[/img]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i2cplease</strong> on 9 Nov 2017, 06:09)</p>

					<p>Well, bad news first: the ads1015 driver is not included in Openwrt/LEDE. So, you would need to build your own firmware yourself. The only thing you would have to change is editing package/kernel/linux/modules/hwmon.mk: copy the entry for the ADT7475 (currently lines 65-79) and replace adt7475 with ads1015 (keep upper/lower case like in the original). Would be nice to send your change back to the project.</p><p>However, for the moment, if i2cdetect doesn&#039;t display the address of your sensor, this indicates a problem in the wiring (basically, that the sensors lines are not properly connected to the GPIOs). You need to provide more information on the sensor module, your schematics and the output of dmesg.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MBS</strong> on 28 Nov 2017, 12:19)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the detailed reply. Two quick things:</p><p>1. With regards to the hwmon.mk, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s using git clone the chaos calmer branch and doing your coding before uploading it to the router?</p><p>2. imgur COM/a/ZyNa4 shows the dmesg output for i2c and what I see with i2cdetect -l from my laptop directly plugged in. As for schematics, with four wires and the photo, it is the VDD to the 3.3V of the router, gnd to gnd, and SDA and SCL to appropriate pins (I&#039;ve since changed them from the original picture, but it&#039;s plugged in correctly). The rightmost block diagram is the chip; of the I2C ports I don&#039;t have ADDR plugged in (it was not mentioned in the wiki).</p><p>ti COM/ods/images/SBAS444C/pg1_fbd_new_bas444.gif</p>									</div>

					<p>Chaos Calmer is pretty old now, so I mainly had LEDE in mind. Since you don&#039;t seem to have i2cdetect installed on your router (which was missing in Chaos Calmer, IIRC), I would recommend to start by installing LEDE 17.01.4 and install the i2c-tools package.<br />To get the source code, git clone is currently the way to go. See the wiki for instructions on building your own firmware image.<br />If you want to see, which I2C devices are connected to the bus, you invoke i2cdetect, with the number of your bus (as listed with the -l parameter) as parameter.<br />With your schematics, I am missing the pull-up resistors between SDA/SCL and Vcc. Are they on the sensor module?<br />Some I2C chips actually allow tri-states of the ADDR line, however I would prefer to connect it to GND for the moment, to be on the safe side.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi MBS. I&#039;ve gotten i2cdetect working with LEDE , and am now trying to program the linux kernel so it&#039;d recognize the chip.</p><p>hxxps://imgur.com/a/m6smq shows how I followed your firmware advice.</p><p>Downside is after make menuconfig (specifically for the Glinet 6416) I cannot get back to LuCI and have to reset the modem using the command line. make executes without an issue, and I&#039;m flashing using LuCI&#039;s web interface. Below is how I set up menuconfig; the only not visible thing is me adding i2c kernel modules.</p><p>hxxps://imgur.com/a/i0hOE</p><p>As for the resistors, they are integrated on the chip. The SDA and SCL output solid DC at the moment since there&#039;s nothing wiggling it. Since it is the only device needing I2C, I&#039;m not going to be using ADDR.</p><p>hxxps://pastebin.com/8rtGrHyB shows the command line output</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i2cplease</strong> on 20 Nov 2017, 03:50)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t fully understand the issue about LuCI right now and could not see all the steps of your menuconfig. Basically, LuCI is not selected by default, and external packages need to be enabled first by running<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a</code></pre></div><p>Then you will find the required entries in menuconfig.<br />As an alternative, you could just install it as written <a href="https://lede-project.org/docs/user-guide/luci.essentials">in the wiki</a>, but that will use a bit more storage over all.</p><p>You can actually drop the &quot;+kmod-hwmon-vid&quot; since your sensor doesn&#039;t need it.</p>									</div>

					<p>1. You can either send a patch to the mailing list or if you have got a Github account, you can send a pull request.<br />2. I have got that in /etc/modules.d/66-i2c-gpio-custom (I just appended my bus information).<br />3. It seems the hwmon-core module is not loaded, and that way even the ads1015 is missing.
