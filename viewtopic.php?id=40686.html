					<p>hi guys</p><p>Hoping you can help me please?</p><p>I installed openwrt after following the wiki post for this router.&nbsp; However, since it has a 4mb flash im struggling for space.</p><p>I really need to get the basics installed being dhcp/wlan/dns/relayd/iptables to try and leave space so I can get openvpn installed.&nbsp; I really want this router to act as my Openvpn local network gateway that will route all my traffic to my remote openvpn server.&nbsp; </p><p>I was therefore hoping to build my own image but Im not sure what the minimal packages/modules required would be. Im terrified of bricking my router :S&nbsp; Really dont want to revert to using my talktalk isp issued router Huawei HG533 as I cant get openwrt on it lol.</p><p>Can anyone advise please?&nbsp; Or is there a simpler way of removing luci etc from the generic bin.&nbsp; Although I thought removing packages from squashfs doesnt actually free up space?</p><p>Apologies if I should have read something else first, Im a noob here - please point me in the right direction if Ive missed something.</p><p>Many thanks and best wishes</p><p>Andy</p>									</div>
