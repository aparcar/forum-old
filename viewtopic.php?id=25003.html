It&#039;s better to download the latest svn image because it has the latest fixes and improvements. Since it&#039;s the first time, you need the factory image.</p><p>Here&#039;s the link to the image:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a></p><p>It&#039;s possible to go from ddwrt to openwrt. Here&#039;s how to do it.</p><p>1. Download the above image.<br />2. Transfer the image to the /tmp directory of your wr1043nd (ftp or otherwise)<br />3. Go to the tmp directory.<br />4. Use this command to flash the factory image of openwrt<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r write openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin linux</code></pre></div><p>5. Wait. If the flashing is successful your wr1043nd will reboot and you will have openwrt running on it.<br />6. telnet 192.168.1.1 will get you into openwrt. Since the svn version has no web interface, but you can install luci to have the web interface working. Check out the wr1043nd wiki for tips and tricks. Here&#039;s the link:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a></p><p>If something goes wrong during the flashing, you have a brick and will need a 3.3 Volt serial cable to unbrick it since the wr1043nd has no recovery mode other than through the serial console. I guess that&#039;s why when I bought mine, the salesperson gave me the support number of tp-link <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>playdude</strong> on 9 Jun 2010, 20:29)</p>

Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve found out.</p><p>tp-link stock firmware to ddwrt works (web interface using ddwrt web image)<br />ddwrt to openwrt works (mtd tool with openwrt factory image)<br />openwrt to tp-link stock firmware works (mtd tool with tp-link stock firmware without the word &quot;boot&quot; in its name - wiki)</p><p>So theoretically it is possible to switch back and forth between the 3 firmwares without using the serial console at all unless something crazy happens during flashing time. I&#039;ll put this information on the wiki page later because I think it&#039;ll be useful for users who want to try openwrt but think once they flash their wr1043nd with one type of firmware, they&#039;re stuck with it. Not me though, openwrt is too much fun to switch <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />.</p>									</div>
