					<p>Hi</p><p>Why we have to use &quot;wifi down&quot; before each scan? Is there another way?<br />When we use this method we have to wait for some seconds before scanning. It makes our scanning process slow.<br />When I scan AP&#039;s with MikroTik OS on a 200MHz processor it takes about 1 second for each refresh but in our method with openwrt on a 600MHz processor each refresh takes 2, 3 or more seconds( it&#039;s depended on AP&#039;s response speed ).</p><p>What can we do to increase our scan refresh speed?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Could be that the reason is that you can&#039;t be connect to a network AND scan at the same time. Wi-fi hopper exhibits the same behaviour where if you scan with it it&#039;ll kick you off your current connection and not let you connect to anything until you disable scanning mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Sp@ce Boy for reply.</p><p>But I&#039;m not connected to any AP before scanning and there&#039;s no any AP with the name of my system at all to connect automatically.<br />Also I know that every GUI like X-WRT use this method for scanning, but it&#039;s very slow. And if you don&#039;t use wifi down before using iwlist scanning the result of scan is toooooo slow (it seems that iwlist uses a cache and because of that it&#039;s tooooo slow). When you use wifi down and recreate ath0, every things will be refreshed, But as I said before, it takes 2 or 3 seconds to give you a result after creation.</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>the scanning speed may depend on the radio circuit used, and drivers that go with it.<br />Can you be more specific what you are using ?<br />In a scan basically the radio listens on all channels for a defined time to listen for beacons and if you define SSIDs it may also issue probes for APs that do not send out a beacon with SSID.<br />E.g. a card with both 802a and bg will need longer as it needs to scan channels in 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. <br />I know in the case of broadcom drivers that it is possble to define the dwell time per channel (wl non-free package) and influence the total time. But as you go quicker you may miss some APs, so it is a trade off.<br />When scanning from a station I never had to issue wifi down. Just use the iw commands for scanning.<br />iw dev &lt;devname&gt; scan [-u] [freq &lt;freq&gt;*] [ssid &lt;ssid&gt;*|passive]<br />iw dev &lt;devname&gt; scan trigger [freq &lt;freq&gt;*] [ssid &lt;ssid&gt;*|passive]<br />iw dev &lt;devname&gt; scan dump [-u]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 8 Jan 2010, 13:02)</p>

					<p>One difference with here is that my wireless devices are called wlan0 wlan1 etc.<br />via the definitions in //etc/config /network and /wireless.<br />I also use a RS board and with it two miniPCI boards with ar9220 radios.<br />I can reproduce your error message when I use iw with an interface name that does not exist.<br />So it must be a configuration issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 8 Jan 2010, 17:24)</p>
