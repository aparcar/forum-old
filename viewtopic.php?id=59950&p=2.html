But chdk does not run on the DSLR-type camera (e.g. EOS 5D). Magic Lantern *does* run on DSLR. chdk provided inspiration for ML; think of it as a hopped-up version of chdk. I will take a closer look at ML to see if they have a similar &quot;headless&quot; feature. </p><p>However, even if ML does provide that, it does not completely meet my objective. I want to be able to use my Lightroom or Capture One software on the Mac end of the connection. They provide many features that are useful - features that cannot be had via browser interface. Consequently, it still seems to me that the approach of &quot;USB masquerading&quot; is a reasonable approach to accomplish this. USB masquerading: Camera, Lightroom&nbsp; and OSX think they are on a USB cable, but we use wifi instead of cable. </p><p>I&#039;ve never programmed USB, so this may be crazy. I would like feedback on this idea from anyone - a &quot;sanity check&quot; please.</p>									</div>

					<p>&quot;USB masquerading&quot; over wifi sounds like a really good solution for cameras and for many other specialty usb devices. Googling that doesn&#039;t turn up any useful links for me. Have you heard about this, or have you invented this phrase? I&#039;d love to see it on openWrt devices.</p>									</div>

You can certainly use Live View on Linux with chdk (provided the camera supports chdk, which the DSLRs mostly don&#039;t). The Raspberry Pi would not be &quot;headless&quot; then (i.e., not remote). The problem is making the Canon software, which the OP wants to use on his Mac, think that a Canon camera which is actually plugged into a remote device is local. This is the &quot;USB Masquerading&quot; which the OP speaks of--a pretty nifty feature.</p><p>I agree that if this were possible, it would probably be easier to get it to work on a headless Raspberry Pi than on an openWrt device, since usually more resources and especially more processing power would be available.</p></blockquote></div><p>----------------------------------</p><p>I want to call your attention to the OpenWrt part of the nice app DslrDashboard that has already solved most of your needs:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://dslrdashboard.info/dslrdashboardserver-ddserver/">http://dslrdashboard.info/dslrdashboardserver-ddserver/</a></p><p>Now... retaking the first post... I m precisely after a Openwrt supported router sized like one of those in the 1sr post amazon list so as to build a wireless tethering &quot;dongle&quot; for my Nikon (DslrDashboard supports Cannon too)</p><p>Routers sized like the ones in later posts have been already made to work with this software suite and there are even demo videos out there... But if you consider that you will need to attach them to the camera hold in your hands, they are still not practically sized.</p><p>So anyone knows a developer (maybe a photographer himself) who would be interested in taking the challenge???&nbsp; if so... I would be ready to make the HW donation!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Might I suggest that those interested specifically in the intersection of OpenWRT and remote control of DSLRs create a new thread with a more descriptive subject?&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying this to be cranky, but just for archival reasons.&nbsp; Most people who will find this thread topic via search are probably looking more generally for small OpenWRT options in general.&nbsp; Once a new thread is created, we can ask the moderators to move the relevant posts from here to there, in order to make it easier for late-comers who are specifically looking for DSLR applications.</p><p>Now that there are several low-cost, tiny routers supporting OpenWRT, this thread may have a longish life as a place to catch up on the latest offerings.</p><p>Just my $0.02.</p>									</div>
