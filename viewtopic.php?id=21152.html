					<p>Hi,<br />I am trying to interface the WRT54GL v1.1 serial port with PIC16F877. I am doing the project listed in <a href="http://jbprojects.net/projects/wifirobot/">http://jbprojects.net/projects/wifirobot/</a><br />Can you share your code for the microcontroller for serial interfacing? And also how do you read the data on the serial port and send to the PC?</p>									</div>
