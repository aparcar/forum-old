If you already have OpenWRT and only want to update, flash the file with &quot;sysupgrade&quot; in the filename. You can do that from the web interface in both cases. Extract the RAR archive before flashing! You have to flash the .bin files.

					<p>I just managed to flash the router with an older file with LuCI included. But now the router is so slow that I can´t access the web menu. I flashed it with the &quot;sysupgrade&quot; commando. Are there any commandos to fully clear the router? I already made a factory reset by typing<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r erase rootfs_data</code></pre></div><p>But no luck, the router is as slow as before factory reset.</p><p>BTW: I can´t get back to the stock firmware because the tmp flash seems to be to small for uploading the ~3,8MB file to it. Any idea? I followed this instructions: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=182670#p182670">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 70#p182670</a></p>									</div>

TP-Links are good and cheap routers, but they don&#039;t have tftp recovery via ethernet, so they are not suitable for beginners. If you make a mistake, you will have to recover with serial cable, which is quite easy, but still it requires opening tha device and soldering cable to the right pins. You can also replace the device, if it&#039;s still under warranty, this is what I have done many times, just don&#039;t tell them you have flashed the firmware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 31 Mar 2013, 03:47)</p>
