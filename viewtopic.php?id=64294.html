					<p>So I downloaded and flashed the firmware from the software on the openwrt&#039;s website for the DIR-645.</p><p>I would like to configure dynamic DNS.&nbsp; I would like to configure a VPN.&nbsp; These options are not in the GUI, so I know I haev to install the packages, but after I do, it seems I have to configure it by command line.&nbsp; The last time I tried that, I almost bricked my router and certain linux commands, like ls and ps, weren&#039;t working.</p><p>So I would prefer to configure these things with a GUI rather than a command line if I have to.&nbsp; Again the router is a DIR-645.</p><p>If I download LuCi separately, and assuming I have all the packages installed, would I be able to configure DDNS and VPN by GUI?&nbsp; I&#039;m just more of a GUI guy rather than command line.&nbsp; It would help a lot.</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I already tried like I said, but the router basically reformatted itself after I couldn&#039;t kill a process and I rebooted the router by power.&nbsp; Like I said, I couldn&#039;t see directories with ls, and I couldn&#039;t see processes with ps until typing it in maybe three to five times.&nbsp; Then I didn&#039;t see the process that the wiki said should be there.&nbsp; So I wrote to the config file, disconnected the ssh connection, and powered down the router.&nbsp; Openwrt then did a reset after that, and all my packages were gone.</p><p>I tried.&nbsp; I can try again, but I&#039;m worried about bricking the router.&nbsp; That is why I&#039;m asking about a GUI.</p>									</div>
