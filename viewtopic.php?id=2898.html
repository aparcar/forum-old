					<p>Hello, ive been footering about with my router for an hour now and finally decided to give up <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.</p><p>My problem is that my WAN (cable, NTL is the ISP) cannot obtain and IP address. Thinking that I may have had some bad nvram settings i decided to default them for a fresh start.</p><p>Currently my only two settings are (I think)<br />wan_proto<br />and<br />wan_ifname</p><p>I tried checking out what udhcpc was doing but it just said sending discover alot then said forking to background.</p><p>Im not sure but I think my solution would be to set the MAC of something to the same MAC as my cable modem?</p><p>Can anyone help me please? Ill post more info if ive missed anything, thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Make sure that wan_proto is set to dynamic.&nbsp; Try unplugging the power to the cable modem for 30 seconds or so (power cycle it) and then turn on your router afterwards.&nbsp; I had the same problem yesterday, thinking it was the nvram variables, but this fixed it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just in case anyone else is having this same problem after an update. Try power cycling both the router and modem at the same time. Not separately.<br />Well at least I learned a fair bit about openwrt while i was messing with everything before i found this message and decided to try this.</p>									</div>
