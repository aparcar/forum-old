					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of getting a Linksys WRT54GL wifi router and reflash its firmware to run Linux. I guess there should be enough RAM to run a basic web server, but there isn&#039;t enough flash memory to hold the web data, and none of the models from Linksys, Buffalo, or Asus seem to have USB running after being flashed with Linux.</p><p>I have a couple of questions:<br />1. Is there such a thing as a USK key-like storage that connects directly to an Ethernet plug (I guess the Linksys doesn&#039;t provide PoE, so it would need an external power supply), or is the only option to get a NAS like the Linksys NSLU2?<br />2. Is it possible to run a web server in a Linux-powered router while holding the data on a separate device, either a USB/Ethernet key or a NAS?</p><p>Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>littlebigman</strong> on 5 Jan 2010, 11:39)</p>
