					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>Earlier this morning, I was trying to set up my new Archer C5 AC1200 (TP-Link) router which I had briefly used in the past.&nbsp; Prior to today, it had an older snapshot of Chaos Calmer installed.&nbsp; Due to it being a snapshot and the time since I flashed it, I decided to upgrade.&nbsp; I downloaded the latest snapshot and flashed it via LUCI - choosing to not save settings.&nbsp; I found out later, I used the factory image instead of the upgrade one <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>After 10 minutes, I still couldn&#039;t get to LUCI, but could telnet.&nbsp; I tried SSH, but when asking for my credentials and using the root user, the default password - admin wouldn&#039;t work nor would my old password, passwd, root, toor, (empty), or anything else I tried.</p><p>I followed steps to restore the factory image (from TP-Link) by using wget to download the latest factory firmware locally, then installing it.&nbsp; After downloading the bin to the tmp folder, I executed the below command:</p><p>mtd -r write /tmp/ArcherC7v1_en_3_15_1_up_boot%28141204%29.bin firmware</p><p>This caused the router to reboot after a few seconds, but ever since it&#039;s been in a reboot loop.&nbsp; I tried the 30-30-30 reset without any change and believe it&#039;s due to the reset button on the C5 being different from what I&#039;ve read.&nbsp; </p><p>The best thing I can find is restoring the firmware via FTP in Recovery Mode as shown in the link below, but seemingly cannot get into Recovery Mode.&nbsp; With the ethernet cable plugged into the WAN port (tried LAN 1, too), I power the router on holding down reset, but it still goes to the boot loop.<br /><a href="https://www.mikepalmer.net/tp-link-archer-c7-ac1750-v2-tftp-recovery/">https://www.mikepalmer.net/tp-link-arch â€¦ -recovery/</a></p><p>Current State<br />- My ethernet adapter is set to 192.168.1.68 / 255.255.255.0 / 192.168.1.1 (Windows)<br />- When connected via WAN port and watching the network adapter, it has a red X when not connected (obviously)&nbsp; For ~1 second ever 20 -30 seconds, the red X disappears as if connected but then immediately goes back to X as the router reboots<br />- When connected to the LAN 1 port, the exact same thing happens<br />- Seemingly, there&#039;s no difference if I hold reset when powering on or not (when it says that, how long do I hold it after powering on???)</p><p>Router Current State<br />- Stuck in reboot loop seemingly no matter what I do (30-30-30, wifi switch off, holding reset when powering on, etc)<br />- Lights on front go between all being on for a split second to only a few<br />- USB LEDs on back (2) stay on at all times and look to be in sync.&nbsp; They turn off for a split second every time the router reboots itself</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Surely, there&#039;s something I can do.&nbsp; It&#039;s not my first choice, but if only choice, I&#039;ll open up and do surgery to access / add serial or whatever is needed.&nbsp; Have all kinds of solder tools, but would like to do all non-invasive steps first.</p><p>Thanks Guys - Wish me Luck!!</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p><p>So I have done further research and played a bit more with it.&nbsp; It seems I&#039;m getting closer to resolving the issue, but feel as though I&#039;m missing one key part.&nbsp; Below are the steps I&#039;m currently trying for which I think I may be leaving something out...</p><p>1. Set NIC (Windows) to 192.168.0.66 / 255.255.255.0 / 192.168.0.1<br />2 Attached ethernet cable between NIC and router&#039;s LAN #1 port<br />3. Launch TFTP Server / Select C:\TFTP / Seelct Netwrok Adapter from step #1 above<br />4. Downloaded the latest factory firmware for my C5 (ArcherC5v1_en_3_14_3_up_boot(150428).bin) to C:\TFTP<br />5. Renamed the firmware above to &quot;orig.bin&quot;<br />6. Using dd for Windows, ran the following command: &quot;dd if=orig.bin of=tplink.bin skip=257 bs=512&quot;&nbsp; This created &quot;tplink.bin&quot; and echoed the below:<br />rawwrite dd for windows version 0.6beta3.<br />Written by John Newbigin &lt;jn@it.swin.edu.au&gt;<br />This program is covered by terms of the GPL Version 2.<br />skip to 131584<br />31744+0 records in<br />31744+0 records out<br />7. Renamed &quot;tplink.bin&quot; to &quot;ArcherC5v1_tp_recovery.bin&quot;<br />8. Held down the reset button on router, powered on, and once WPS LED lit, released the reset button</p><p>When doing this, I saw TFTP transfer the file and the boot loop stopped.&nbsp; Based on the LEDs alone, it seemed that the router was working normally as the LAN Port #1 LED was lit and the WAN port lit when I tried plugging in a cable.&nbsp; However - I couldn&#039;t ping the gateway - 192.168.0.1.&nbsp; I tried setting my NIC to DHCP, but it didn&#039;t pull an address.&nbsp; Next, I tried rebooting, but it went back to the reboot loop.</p><p>What I&#039;ve Tried:<br />- The above steps (minus the dd part) using an openwrt firmware with the same results<br />- Using the firmware file without running dd command</p><p>I will note that once TFTP startsa to transfer the file, it&#039;s adapter setting goes back to the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) for some reason.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if that has anything to do with it.</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks</p><p><strong>UPDATE #2</strong></p><p>OK, I just tried the same process on a different computer.&nbsp; I had the same result - but - even though it still reverted back to the loopback adapter once the transfer started, the transfer took 12 minutes instead of &gt; 1 second.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t used TFTP in a while, but seem to remember that it wasn&#039;t the fastest.&nbsp; Am I on the right path?&nbsp; Below&#039;s a screenshot - Thanks<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://guidesforit.com/share/router.png" alt="TFTP" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BzowK</strong> on 5 Jul 2015, 22:27)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Yes and no.&nbsp; I guess I left out typing a step which I should have put between 4 &amp; 5. I used the command line in step 5, but before that renamed the OEM firmware file &quot;ArcherC5v1_en_3_14_3_up_boot(150428).bin)&quot; to &quot;orig.bin.&quot;. </p><p>Do you have any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>sorry cant help you<br />I might even be wrong in this one, I read your file ArcherC7v1_en_3_15_1_up_boot%28141204%29.bin&nbsp; and it has the word BOOT, in my 741 and 842 if I upload a file with boot I will brick it, dont know in your case<br />Everytime I need to go back to stock I use files with no boot, downloaded from Polish server <a href="ftp://tplink-forum.pl/orgin_bez_boot/">ftp://tplink-forum.pl/orgin_bez_boot/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danymarc</strong> on 6 Jul 2015, 03:18)</p>

					<p>FYI - trunk snapshots do not include Luci, which was the initial problem you had after flashing. The factory vs upgrade file is also not a huge deal, as long as you&#039;re ok with losing any configuration you may have made. The upgrade file does NOT preserve packages that have been downloaded (e.g. Luci).</p>									</div>

					<p>Try disabling firewall on your PC. ArcherC5v1_tp_recovery.bin is correct file name for tftp method. I ran into similar issue in past and firewall turned out to be the culprit.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>farrukh</strong> on 6 Jul 2015, 13:51)</p>

					<p>Thanks. I know that the firewall isn&#039;t the issue as I don&#039;t have a 3rd party software one installed and my Windows ones are disabled.&nbsp; I played with it for another hour and am going nuts.&nbsp; Currently, I can get the transfer to at least start; but the router reboots almost immediately after the transfer or shortly thereafter and continues to reboot in the loop.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m considering trying out the serial connection assuming my old serial -&gt; usb converter will do the job.&nbsp; Seems to be a lower level fix.&nbsp; Was hoping to not have to perform surgery, but seems I&#039;ll have no choice.&nbsp; Any more suggestions from anyone?&nbsp; Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Good morning! </p><p>I have the exact same problem, except my router is the Archer C7 AC1750. Another difference is that I <em>meant</em> to flash stock tplink firmware coming from openwrt. I did this using the mtd method, resulting in an endless bootloop. <br />So I resorted to the TFTP method, but I can&#039;t get it to transfer the firmware to the router. <br />Maybe you can help me, so I can hopefully contribute to the solution of the problem after I have setup everything the right way.<br />- How did you setup your nic in Windows? Did you leave the dns fields empty? <br />- How did you setup TFTP? Do you use the dhcp server?&nbsp; <br />I hope you can help me with these settings, so I can start (or continue) troubleshooting and maybe we can solve this thing.</p>									</div>
