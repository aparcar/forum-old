					<p>First off I must apologize for not understanding 98% of everything Iâ€™ve gotten myself into on this new firmware upload. I was under the impression that this was a GUI interface similar to Tomato and DD-WRT.</p><p>I downloaded the appropriate file for my WRT54G and the upgrade from Tomato 1.13 went fine. After pulling my hair out and not gaining access to the router with 192.168.1.1, I attempted a Telnet session as a last resort and connected with the little screen that mentioned something like a drink recipe if I remember right. The first thing that caught my eye was the notation that said if you change the password with â€œpasswdâ€&nbsp; that it would disable Telnet sessions and be accessible via â€œSSHâ€&nbsp; which I assumed that I would be able to login to the GUI via an <a href="https://192.168.1.1">https://192.168.1.1</a> session.</p><p>After hours of looking for, and attempting to run a â€œfreebieâ€&nbsp; â€œSSHâ€&nbsp; program I gave up. I hate to do so, but I have. Is there anyone that can point me in the right direction to re-flash this WRT54G back to â€œanythingâ€ ? Iâ€™ve tried all of the steps suggested in other web site to â€œre-brickâ€&nbsp; or re-flash the unit. It will respond to pings, however after timing the up load via a TFTP session the router still will not accept a new/different *.bin file.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><br /><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>John, you have a few options.&nbsp; The tftp on reset *should* work.&nbsp; Be sure it&#039;s a proper bin file and send it 1-2seconds after power up.</p><p>The two windows apps I use:<br />SSH: PuTTY <a href="http://www.putty.nl/download.html">http://www.putty.nl/download.html</a><br />So you&#039;re aware, SSH looks like telnet.<br />File-Explorer-like: WinSCP <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">http://winscp.net/eng/index.php</a><br />Great for editing things for the non-Linux user.&nbsp; You need the right /etc/config/network setting to make a connection on an existing LAN network.&nbsp; Holler if you need help but get to the point you can edit /etc/config/network first.</p><p>Here&#039;s a sequence that may help.&nbsp; Be sure you get the right file.&nbsp; It&#039;s all commandline AND you must have a connection to get the firmware:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>##### work in the temp directory:
cd /tmp

##### get the firmware.bin (I&#039;ll use firmware.bin, change this to whatever it is):
wget http://(URL to get the firmware.bin)

##### make a .trx file from the .bin file (note names, may as well leave of=firmware.trx but change the if=whatever you got):
dd if=firmware.bin of=firmware.trx bs=32 skip=1

##### You now have firmware.trx ready to flash... with this:
mtd -r write firmware.trx linux

##### It will reboot when done.  Give it a lot of time.</code></pre></div><p>It&#039;s not without risk, of course.&nbsp; A smaller firmware may be safest.</p><p>EDIT: Instead of getting the internet connection going you can alternately get the .bin file to /tmp by WinSCP (drag-n-drop interface).</p><p>I tried to figure out the simplest path.&nbsp; For example, I know of no other firmware that supplies .trx files but .bin files are common.&nbsp; I do not think you&#039;ll be the first to be in this situation so I invite everyone to come up with the simplest and safest recovery steps for a non-Linux user.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 8 Dec 2007, 16:31)</p>
