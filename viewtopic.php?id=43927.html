					<p>I am attempting to clone a router using &quot;Generate archive&quot; on the &quot;Backup / Flash Firmware&quot; page of the first router and then using &quot;Restore backup&quot; with the archive on a second router.</p><p>This does NOT create an exact copy however.&nbsp; On the &quot;Wifi&quot; page of the second router there is a second entry &quot;Generic 802.11 Wireless Controller (radio1)&quot; in addition to the &quot;Atheros AR9285 802.11bgn (radio0) entry configured on the first router.&nbsp; I have attempted to delete it from the /etc/config/wireless file, but it returns following reboot.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>Is there a better way to clone an exact copy of a configured router?</p><p>Failing that, is there a way to eliminate the second wireless entry?</p>									</div>

					<p>The wireless config usually embeds the device specific mac address to identify the radio, so if you upload this config to another model, OpenWrt will not find the radio and create a new default section for it. If you want to share the wifi config across multiple devices you have to replace the &quot;option macaddr ...&quot; lines with &quot;option phy phyX&quot; where &quot;phy0&quot; is the 1st radio, &quot;phy1&quot; the 2nd and so on.</p>									</div>
