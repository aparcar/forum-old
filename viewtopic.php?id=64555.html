					<p>I have majorly messed ip my config and need to reset the openwrt firmware to default to start over. however no clear cut manner to this is listed and trying to stumble through other hotos have failed. I am too simple minded that a reset button should actually reset the thing. that said does this router have a reset method or did I make a paperweight?</p>									</div>
