					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I am currently going crazy, because in my dorm at my university they only give us an ethernet port, after that you have to connect your PC via AnyConnect to use the internet. You can imagine that this is a problem for smartphones and consoles.</p><p>So I am looking for a (cheap?) router to connect to a Cisco AnyConnect network and share that connection with my devices.</p><p>a) Is this possible?<br />b) What router would you prefer? (Does flash size matter? D-Link products come in different revisions... how do I make sure I get one that is supported?)</p><p>Thanks in advance and greetings from Germany,<br />eismann</p>									</div>

					<p>When traveling with my family on vacation I wanted to connect back to my home using OpenVPN and allow the kids tablets and smartphones to access the internet over the VPN using wifi. I eventually succeeded in doing this with an SLBoat modded WR703n and a bunch of custom shell scripts to fixup the routing after connecting via Luci but it was clunky, overcomplex, and took too long to set up after arrival :-(</p><p>Then I discovered that windows 7/8 comes with a builtin SoftAP that can re-serve any Windows network connection - including OpenVPN - and has builtin WPA2 security. I used a freeware application called Virtual Router ( <a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/">http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/</a> ) to configure it rather than messing with DOS commands.</p><p>Now,&nbsp; when we arrive I can just set up the wife&#039;s laptop to connect to the hotel wifi, fire up OpenVPN, then Virtual Router, and all the kids tablets and phones automatically connect. Wife doesn&#039;t even know its running when she uses her laptop. Only down sides are that reconnecting after disconnection is manual (thats normal for hotel wifi anyway), and you have to leave the PC on.</p><p>Same set up even works with my Dell Venue Pro 8 tablet which runs Windows 8.1.</p><p>I&#039;m a Linux guy and I really wanted to do this with OpenWRT but the Windows way was much simpler.</p><p>-PG</p>									</div>
