					<p>Hello,</p><p>I tried to back out of an open-wrt install (BB) on a TP-Link Archer C5 by flashing the OEM firmware. The flash proceeded to 45% and then declared an incompatibility and aborted.</p><p>After trying a few things, I tried a 30 30 30 which has yielded a router that is set to 192.168.1.1 and displays the Luci root login.</p><p>I can&#039;t login with the usual passwords (empty, &quot;administrator&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;root&quot; etc). I assume then that the router is past the first login stage. All attempts to telnet and ssh to the box are denied.</p><p>I installed Ubuntu on my laptop to try to use the mtd program (closest that I could find is mtd-utils package), but as i understand it, I need to be able to login to the router to use it, am I wrong?</p><p>My goal is to reflash the orginal OEM firmware. I have the dd edited version of the OEM boot.bin</p><p>Do I rub the router on the carpet to reset it? Put it in the freezer for a week? Break out the soldering iron to start connecting pins?</p><p>How do I reset/bypass the admin password?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like your router is not bricked if you can get to luci, so that&#039;s good. You should be able to flash the OEM firmware (with uboot removed) using standard Luci flashing functionality. Not sure why it didn&#039;t work, although it&#039;s unclear to me if the first attempt was with uboot removed or not?</p><p>The other thing is that you need to get into the webadmin.&nbsp; The whole &quot;30 30 30&quot; is DD-WRT voodoo magic that doesn&#039;t really do anything. What you need is to get into OpenWrt failsafe mode, which is described in the wiki. </p><p>Another option is the TFTP flash, which some TP-Link routers have. Those instructions are also in the wiki. Pay close attention to the IP addresses you need to set - some TP-Link routers use 192.168.1.x and some are 192.168.0.x. </p><p>Last resort is a serial flash, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;re anywhere near that at this point.</p>									</div>

					<p>@drawz Thank you!<br />It&#039;s all sorted! The OpenWRT failsafe mode led me into the light.</p><p>Thanks also for the voodoo magic alert.</p>									</div>
