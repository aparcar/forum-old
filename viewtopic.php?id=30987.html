					<p>I&#039;m trying to get some help from the Ubiquiti forums, but they are sluggish to say the least, and waiting for a moderator to approve a post takes ages (if you excuse the hyperbole).</p><p>Given that I&#039;m really short on time, I&#039;m hoping a kind soul here can help me out.</p><p>I&#039;m abroad on vacation and I wanted to help a friend here with his little WiFi problem. Basically, what he wants to do is control which clients can and which can&#039;t access his WiFi. My friend isn&#039;t very technical, and thus running a local RADIUS server, while the cheapest solution, could be problematic. Thus I&#039;ve found <a href="http://www.nowiressecurity.com">http://www.nowiressecurity.com</a>/ and I think it&#039;s a good way to go.</p><p>However, I can&#039;t seem to configure his AP / Antenna, the Ubiquiti NanoStation2 to work with WPA Enterprise.</p><p>But I found this page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/nanostation">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/nanostation</a> which describes that OpenWrt should work with NS2. So I downloaded <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/atheros/openwrt-atheros-ubnt2-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ uashfs.bin</a> and stumbled upon my first issue: I couldn&#039;t change the firmware using the flash interface, as it told me that the image is bad (the Wiki suggests this can be ignored, but this wasn&#039;t the case).</p><p>At this point, I&#039;m thinking of using TFTP to flash the device, but first I wanted to test OpenWrt on a different device, one that I knew I could flash: WRT45GL, but, because it is based on a different chipset, I also couldn&#039;t get WPA Ent to work (2.4 kernel doesn&#039;t have the option at all, while setting the WPA Ent option on 2.6 caused the WiFi to stop working and I could no longer find the SSID). I&#039;m HOPING these issues are only with Broadcom, and that flashing the Atheros firmware on NS2 will get everything working smoothly.</p><p>So, to summarise:<br />a) Is flashing OpenWrt on NanoStation2 a good idea to get WPA Enterprise working?<br />b) How do I flash OpenWrt on NS2? Is TFTP the only method? How do I bypass the web-interfaces &quot;bad image&quot; message blocking 3rd party firmware?</p><p>Please note: I am aware that OpenWrt can be very... technical, so to speak, with lots of advanced settings being done by manually changing config files. If setting up WPA Enterprise is possible using only such methods, then flashing OpenWrt is not a good idea; when I go back home and a problem arises, my friend would never be able to deal with it. Please keep this in mind.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shaamaan</strong> on 22 Jul 2011, 16:37)</p>
