					<p>I have three Zyxel P660HW-D1 routers. It would be great if this platform was supported by OpenWRT. Some info about the router:</p><p>Ports: ADSL + WiFi (b+g) + 4xEthernet (100M)<br />RAM: 16 Megabytes (WinBond W9812G6DH-75)<br />Flash: 2 Megabytes (MX29LV160CBTC-70G)<br />CPU: AR7 (TNETD7200ZDW)</p><p>As AR7 platform is supported, I suppose the main problem can be with the low amount of Flash.</p><p>Is there anything I can do to test and support this platform?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doragasu</strong> on 11 Aug 2012, 22:06)</p>

					<p>That routers are pretty are old, slow and with small memory.<br />Are you from Spain? Here there are lots of them, they were used by the ISP Telefonica, and even with the original firmware their performance was just regular.<br />I don&#039;t think the dev team will put their efforts to support such old hardware, being 2012 and with routers twice as powerful as that one for less than $20...<br />Also it has parallel flash interface, so even upgrading its flash size is a lot harder hard and risky than SPI flash based.</p>									</div>

					<p>As you guessed, I&#039;m Spanish :-)</p><p>I didn&#039;t want to use these routers for &quot;standard routing purposes&quot;, I just wanted to play with them, to make Internet connected gadgets, like <a href="http://kernelhacks.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/making-ip-webcam-using-old-router.html">the IP Camera I did using a CT536+ router</a>.</p><p>I suppose I&#039;ll trash the routers then :-(. Thanks for the answer.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you check in amazon.es , you will see that currently they have TP-LINK WR740N (v4) for just 13€, and the shipping, if you make the premium trial, will be free for whatever you buy in a month.
