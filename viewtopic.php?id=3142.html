					<p>Quick Question: I&#039;m trying to build a custom asterisk package from the 1.0.9 source and I get the error posted above in the subject line.&nbsp; Can somebody explain what I&#039;m missing here?&nbsp; </p><p>I get a make clean to execute without errors by editing the proper makefiles (it won&#039;t work with the straight source)&nbsp; Perhaps I shouldn&#039;t be copying the complete source code and plopping it into the package directory...&nbsp; Instructions are clear enough in the online documentation but rather ambiguous when it comes to how this magic SDK works, and what it needs for something as complicated as the asterisk sources.&nbsp; There&#039;s way too much junk in there.&nbsp; It should be possible to get a build of * under 500K for these routers- gsm, Ulaw, SIP, IAX, and just a few other bare necessities- while also fixing the problem of hook-flash crashing.</p><p>Thanks very much in advance for anyone who can help,</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Thomas Hutton</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d really like to make and perfect it myself if that&#039;s possible.&nbsp; There&#039;s so many things I want to trim out - including the generic comment lines in the /etc/asterisk config files, and a bunch of those configs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to compile any of the following libraries which I have a script that removes as follows: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /usr/lib/asterisk/modules
rm app_a* app_c* app_db.so app_directory.so app_disa.so app_enumlookup.so app_eval.so app_exec.so app_f* app_g* app_i* app_l*
rm app_parkandannounce.so app_privacy.so app_q* app_r* app_se* app_sms.so app_softhangup.so  app_striplsd.so
rm app_substring.so app_system.so app_talkdetect.so app_test.so app_txtcidname.so app_u* app_w* cdr_*
rm chan_agent.so chan_mgcp.so chan_skinny.so codec_a* codec_g726.so codec_ilbc.so codec_lpc10.so
rm format_g72* format_h263.so format_ilbc.so format_pcm_alaw.so format_sln.so format_vox.so
rm pbx_spool.so pbx_wilcalu.so res_agi.so res_monitor.so</code></pre></div><p>None of those are necessary for connection to an IAX termination service such as diamondcard.us or teliax.com.&nbsp; Without those files asterisk runs fine, although it requires a pretty restrictive modules.conf, and the removal of several configs in /etc/asterisk.&nbsp; My current revision of modules.conf looks like this:<br /> </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[modules]
autoload=no

load=res_features.so ; Call Parking Resource
load=chan_iax2.so ; Inter Asterisk eXchange (Ver 2)
load=chan_local.so ; Local Proxy Channel

[global]</code></pre></div><p>On top of this, as mentioned earlier, I have the number of files required in /etc/asterisk down to 10, give or take a couple.&nbsp; </p><p>I believe there is still a file or two that needs to be put in to solve the hook flash problem.&nbsp; This is something I&#039;m prepared to spend a lot of time with if someone can bring me into the loop with the SDK error.&nbsp; I sincerely appreciate the offer to make a mini-package, but, I believe I&#039;m going to want to create a lot of them for testing, and I wouldn&#039;t want to ask you to spend that much time on it.</p><p>Tom</p>									</div>
