					<p>I use an Atheros wireless NIC&nbsp; instead of the Broadcom&#039;s in the WL-500GP, and then download kamikaze 7.09 into the router. The type in the /etc/config/wireless is automaticlly changed&nbsp; from &quot;Broadcom&quot; to &quot;Atheros&quot;,and the router is running well. However, when I change the ESSID,the function of wifi is disabled.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Use the command &quot;ifconfig&quot;, there is no wifi , then &quot;ifconfig wifi0 up&quot;, the mac address of wifi0 alters 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:.......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are some articles referring the success of atheros in 500GP, I absolutely don&#039;t know why?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My English is quite poor, there must be somewhere not clear, I am eager for your help, my friends.</p>									</div>

					<p>make sure your /etc/config/wireless doesn&#039;t have a &quot;option disabled 1&quot; line. if so remove it or set it to &quot;option disabled 0&quot; instead.<br />after this just do &quot;wifi up&quot; and it should be ok.</p>									</div>

					<p>cavelas: are you able to get a good wifi signal and do your wifi clients get disconnected after a while? I haven&#039;t managed to get my atheros card in my WL-500GP to work normally. I get a very weak signal all the time and after a while WPA disconnects the sessions every couple of seconds...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,<br />I have a question maybe a bit off topic. I&#039;d also like to buy this AP and the only reason why I hesitate is the broadcom chipset which forces the use of 2.4 Kernel. You guys and the wiki&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GP">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ us/WL500GP</a>&nbsp; are talking about Atheros chipset. Does it mean that you bought a new Atheros mini PCI card and put it instead of the original broadcom ? Or some models are shipped with the Atheros card ?</p><p>Thanks for your help,<br />Tex.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tex-Twil</strong> on 6 Feb 2008, 10:55)</p>
