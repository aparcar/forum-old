					<p>I set up and configured tinyproxy only to discover that performance was horrible.&nbsp; Loading pages with many images was painfully slow.</p><p>I tracked the problem down to DNS.&nbsp; I had dnsmasq installed and was using a customized dnsmasq.conf instead of the the default, nvram configration in /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq.&nbsp; /etc/resolv.conf was symlinked to /tmp/resolv.conf, which in turn was symlinked to /tmp/resolv.conf.auto.&nbsp; The result was that tinyproxy was resolving all addresses using the upstream, ISP nameserver which was very slow.</p><p>I deleted the /etc/resolv.conf symlink and recreated /etc/resolv.conf with the following content:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; search lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nameserver 127.0.0.1</p><p>tinyproxy is now performing extremely well.</p><p>If this is indeed the correct configuration, an update to the dnsmasq wiki page and perhaps the tinyproxy page might be helpful for others.&nbsp; I thought I would post here, first, to ensure I&#039;ve got my facts straight. ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Semifor,</p><p>Thanks for your post on my blog regarding tinyproxy on WRT54G. I have some questions for you:<br />1) Where did you download the tinyproxy package from?<br />2) Which version of tinyproxy are you running?<br />3) Have you found that tinyproxy crashes periodically, requiring a restart of tinyproxy or even the router itself?</p>									</div>

					<p>The alphacore site seems to be down but I found the package in the backports repository here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/rc6/tinyproxy_1.6.3-1_mipsel.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/ â€¦ mipsel.ipk</a></p><p>When I tried tinyproxy a few months ago it seemed to periodically crash. I can&#039;t remember if just tinyproxy crashed or if the whole router stopped responding. Either way, the problem went away when I stopped running tinyproxy. For now, I&#039;m using squid on a regular workstation but I&#039;d sure like to get tinyproxy working rock solid on the WRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have noticed that my speed is cut in half when I am using tinyproxy. I tried to update the resolv.conf file as stated, but still, no luck. Any thought on what I should try?</p>									</div>
