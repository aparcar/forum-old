Unfortunately, the script at &quot;<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.firewall#vpn_firewall_script">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.i … all_script</a>&quot; is not working with my setup on CC rc3. My IPSEC&nbsp; site-site tunnel is up, but &quot;routing&quot; is not working on hosts connected to the 1990AC.</p><p> The errors that are emitted when the firewall scripts run, are &quot;No chain/target/match by that name&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; The targets that are not found include <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_INPUT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_nat</p><p>&nbsp; The script is configuring targets like<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_forward<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_output<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_input<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_dest_ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_src_REJECT</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This seems like it is very close to working, but not quite.</p></blockquote></div><p>I have very little experience with editing scripts on Linux, so I can&#039;t comment as to where exactly the problem is in the script, however I can share why the problem is occurring:</p><ul><li><p>OpenWRT uses a custom form of iptables, run by <em>fw3</em>, and because of this, normal chain names won&#039;t work.&nbsp; These include the first set of targets, however the second set is correct for fw3.</p></li></ul><p>My guess is you simply need to edit what your ${zone} variables point to to ensure they point to the second set of targets.</p><p><strong><span class="bbu">EDIT</span></strong><br /><em>I&#039;m curious why you&#039;ve chosen to manually run a secondary firewall script, and was wondering what you&#039;re looking to accomplish by doing so. </em></p><br /><ul><li><p><em>The reason I ask is what you&#039;re attempting to accomplish can probably be done far easier by either adding rules directly via LuCI or manually editing the <strong>/etc/config/firewall</strong> config file.&nbsp; If you need to manually have iptables commands ran, then <strong>/etc/firewall.user</strong> would accomplish the job.</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Depending on how complex you need the firewall to be, I think you may be making more work for yourself than what&#039;s needed for what you&#039;re trying to accomplish</em></p></blockquote></div>									</div>
