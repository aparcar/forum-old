					<p><strong>Please, how does one determine the wan gateway from command line/shell script in OpenWrt using uci or some other command?</strong></p><p>Some context:<br />I&#039;d like to try my luck with using a shell script as an alternative to the vpnbypass package. I want to learn about this stuff and think I&#039;d have a better chance of understanding what&#039;s going on if I were to use something like this.</p><p>Trouble is I need an alternative to the &quot;nvram get wan0_gateway&quot; expression that occurs near the middle of the script I found. </p><p>I figured out that OpenWrt uses uci instead of nvram, but it doesn&#039;t seem that uci can find the wan gateway on my router. The OpenWrt documentation mentions the existence of a network.wan.gateway variable, but my router doesn&#039;t seem to have it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># uci get network.wan.gateway
uci: Entry not found

# uci -P/var/state show network.wan
network.wan=interface
network.wan.ifname=&#039;eth1&#039;
network.wan.proto=&#039;dhcp&#039;
network.wan.peerdns=&#039;0&#039;
network.wan.up=&#039;1&#039;
network.wan.device=&#039;eth1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Here&#039;s the script I&#039;d like to try. The &quot;nvram get wan0_gateway&quot; in the command substitution near the middle of the script is mucking things up because my router doesn&#039;t have the nvram command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

					<p>Beautiful, angelos. Thank you.

Unfortunately, now that this part works, my router complains of several other things in the script. I think I&#039;m giving up on an alternative to vpnbypass for now--will just try to understand vpnbypass itself to the best of my ability.</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems the script is for routers and was meant to be distro-agnostic. I found it here:<br /><a href="https://torguard.net/forums/index.php?/topic/499-dd-wrttomatoopenwrtpadavan-route-specific-traffic-around-the-vpn/">https://torguard.net/forums/index.php?/ … d-the-vpn/</a></p><p>Alas, even after replacing the nvram command with your offering, it seems there are other things about this script that make it unusable on OpenWrt as-is.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, it is better to figure out, how vpnbypass works. nvram is used in Padavan firmware. So what is your error message, running compound command above&amp;</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, ulmwind. I definitely want to make this script work, but given all the time I&#039;ve spent looking for, installing, and now troubleshooting vpnbypass, my wife calls the router my &quot;girlfriend&quot;. As much as I would like to, I don&#039;t want to make matters worse by working on two projects simultaneously.</p><p>May I suggest that once vpnbypass is squared away I open a new thread so that we can attack this script? The script does look simpler than the contents of the vpnbypass package, so it would be a good learning exercise.</p>									</div>
