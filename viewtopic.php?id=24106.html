LOL and last time, when the router worked i login to the router via web interface via this ip 192.168.33.1.</p><p>But still i could do this in 192.168.11.1 ? to flash the router again ?</p></blockquote></div><p>Forget all about failsafe mode. You do not need this.</p><p>Use the instructions exactly as they are posted above.</p><p>You MUST use <strong>192.168.11.1</strong> when tftp&#039;ing any image to this router. <strong>192.168.11.1</strong> is the IP the router uses to &quot;listen&quot; for any tftp traffic.</p><p>It really does not matter what other IP you ever used or connected on before. Do not use any other IP.</p><p>Additionally, there is a newer version (RC3) available so you may want to download the newest version before proceeding.</p><p>PATIENCE is the key.
