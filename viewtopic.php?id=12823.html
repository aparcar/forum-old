					<p>Your network looks misconfigured. The two wireless interfaces should be on the same subnet if they are to pass traffic<br />(at least if they are to pass at the IP layer).</p><p>In my network I use /30 subnets for the situation you have there.</p>									</div>

					<p>dboreham,&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for your response. I was hoping to be able to pass traffic with the wifi links on two seperate subnets.&nbsp; I thought there might be a way, but it seems like there isn&#039;t.&nbsp; So my next questions is.&nbsp; Lets say </p><p>Router A = 10.1.1.1/24<br />Router B = 10.1.1.2/24</p><p>I need to use a 24 bit mask because I will also have people connecting to the wireless link.&nbsp; </p><p>I need to pass traffic from PC 192.168.1.2 to PC 192.168.2.2 would I just have to add route on <br />both routers or would I also need some firewall rules ?</p><p>If you have a setup would you mind sharing your config files.&nbsp; Change the values of your ip&#039;s/passwords for security<br />of course.</p><p>Thanks again<br />ScarEye</p>									</div>

					<p>Well...really I think you should do some reading on IP and static routing. <br />It&#039;s not that complex to learn and you&#039;d have a much better time<br />with a grasp of the basics rather than trying to copy someone else&#039;s configuration blind.</p><p>One thing I will say is this : the wireless network is a mac or link layer network -- it doesn&#039;t care itself<br />about IP address nor subnets. IP addresses are a property of the OS network layer on each node, specifically<br />each interface (ath0, ath1, etc) has an IP address.&nbsp; For two interfaces to communicate over the wireless<br />network they must be assigned IP addresses on the same subnet. That&#039;s a &#039;rule&#039; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Therefore you can if you wish have more than one subnet on the same wireless network, provided<br />you don&#039;t need to exchange traffic between nodes on different subnets (directly).</p><p>You can use routing to exchange traffic between nodes not on the same subnet, even when they<br />are on the same wireless network.</p>									</div>

					<p>dboreham,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as IP (IPv4)/Staic Routing is concerned I am proficient in this area.&nbsp; However, I am not proficient with linux/iptables.&nbsp; And I thought maybe I am missing something in this area. </p><p>What I did do was install tcpdump and send a icmp request from one subnet to the other and the request does get to the other side. But it does&#039;t get a response back.&nbsp; Maybe I am missing something really simple.&nbsp; I will look over everything and see if I can come up with something.</p><p>Thanks<br />ScarEye</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So I figured out what the problem was.&nbsp; For some reason when I add my static route to /etc/config/network restart the interface<br />or even reboot the router the route wasn&#039;t being added.&nbsp; So I manually added the static route and BAM!! I can talk between the two <br />subnets.&nbsp; I have added static routes in /etc/config/network in 7.06 and it&#039;s worked with with no problem.&nbsp; I guess I will try to figure out<br />why this is not working or just create a script that will add the routes for me.</p><p>Thanks<br />ScarEye</p>									</div>
