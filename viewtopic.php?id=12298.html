					<p>do you have multiple version of GCC installed ? I had a similar issue when I had several versions of gcc installed with another program awhile ago, I think you can change which version of GCC you can compile with something like &#039;export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.81&#039; or where you have installed 3.81 </p><p>If you Google selecting different versions of GCC im sure it will come up with something.</p><p>I could be way off the mark though</p><p>-Cheers<br />Rip</p>									</div>

					<p>Does the fact you use a 64 bit Linux have anything to do with the problem? I am no expert on this, but I thought the buildroot provided by OpenWRT was designed to run on x86.</p>									</div>

					<p>The comment about the x86-64 was my next question as well.</p><p>I have checked and seem to only have one version of gcc installed.

					<p>I might be off the mark here, but Fedora splits very package up in regular program &amp; headers (usually called $package-dev.blabla.rpm). Did you install the headers for make and gcc, if there are any? I cannot imagine they&#039;d split out headers out of development packages, but it&#039;s worth a try...</p>									</div>

					<p>At least Kamikaze 7.07 release compiles on 32bit and 64bit hosts fine. I&#039;m using Ubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04. 32bit host is a Intel Core 2 Duo. 64bit host is a AMD Turion64.</p><p>Btw. You can check with &#039;make prereq&#039; if you have all required host apps installed.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am really not sure what fixd it but deleteing the tmp directory that make creates when you try to compile fixed it....... *shrugs*<br />Thanks all for your suggestions and help.</p>									</div>
