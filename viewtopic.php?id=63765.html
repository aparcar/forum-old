					<p>Hi,</p><p>considering OpenWrt compatible devices are easily available and that VLAN tagging is possible on lots of devices. Might it be a good choice to choose it as cheap and smart switch?</p><p>Comparing what such an OpenWrt device can handle between plane switched traffic and vlan tagged traffic?<br />Are there rough numbers about how much performance loss there is?</p><p>I once met a guy who was blabbering something about having this VLAN implemented in Software as a kernel module vs. a device that has this feature &quot;in silicon&quot;.</p><p>Thx</p>									</div>
