					<p>On some devices, the CPU has just one ethernet port, and WAN / LAN are separated by means or tagging each port separately, thus LAN is on eth0.1 and WAN on eth0.2; on other devices, it is completely different. If your router has WAN on eth0, then you should use &quot;option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;&quot;.</p>									</div>

Just investigate about your hardware, experiment, and see what works for you.</p><p>If you device has separate ethernet interfaces for WAN and LAN, you do not need to use VLANs, because you can easily separate traffic for each interfaces. But you can still use VLANs: for example, I have several LANs, assigned to the LAN ports on the router, using VLANs.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eduperez</strong> on 24 Oct 2016, 12:14)</p>
