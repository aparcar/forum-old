					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am running the above setup, and i spent the entire day yesterday configuring and playing with my router to get it just right.</p><p>Unfortunately, at the very last hour, i decided to issue a reboot to make sure that an application server (webapp) was installed correctly.</p><p>The router failed to boot back into my image, i was able to press the usb coipy button which in this case copies a fail safe boot loader, but was pretty much mystified as to what the problem could be because it keeps occurring.</p><p>I did set boot_dev to /dev/ide/host0/target0/lun0 etc etc etc /part1 and even read into the root2x.sh shell script which is the script that you are instructed to run to copy the boot environment over to part1 but alas, i could not find my out of this.</p><p>I was able to mount my partition part1 and see that my partitions are still intact and all my data&nbsp; is still on the hard disk, but how to boot to it remains a mystery.&nbsp; Can some one give me some usefull information here on where to look, and i will do the research to figure it out.</p><p>thanks</p><p>Ron</p>									</div>
