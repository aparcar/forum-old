					<p>Most router CPUs are too slow to do anything useful with the faster speeds. OpenWrt or stock doesn&#039;t matter. Hopefully this will change in the next generation as we move to more ARM-based CPUs.</p>									</div>

					<p>The Pogoplug Series 4 has two USB 3.0 ports and can run OpenWRT. However as others have pointed out, USB3 speed is CPU bound. The Pogoplug v4 has a 800Mhz ARM processor and cannot take full advantage of the USB3 port. Not sure if multiple cores would make a difference, but I&#039;m thinking 1.6Ghz or 2Ghz would be where you start seeing a difference in data throughput between a USB2 vs USB3 port.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for the suggestions guys. Currently I top out at 10 MB/s on my TP-Link WDR4300 with a USB 2.0 drive using Samba. That&#039;s not bad, but that&#039;s only for transferring very large files. If I&#039;m syncing work files from a PC, that may include thousands of small files, and the performance is abysmal.</p><p>The Netgear 7500 looks interesting as it uses a Qualcomm chipset and already has a limited AA build of OpenWRT available for it. I may just go that route and use the stock firmware for the time being. The Pogoplug is also something I&#039;d like to look more into.</p>									</div>

I went ahead and ordered a Netgear R7500 X4 and I immediately have buyer&#039;s remorse. I&#039;ve heard the horror stories about Netgear&#039;s firmware, and wow they were right. What a PoS. Very buggy. 5Ghz doesn&#039;t work reliably on my MacBook Pro, while it did just fine using the TP-Link WDR4300. Even a password protected Samba is broken. I already miss OpenWRT and it&#039;s been just a day. I&#039;d be open to donating the Netgear R7500 if it means getting a working build of Barrier Breaker on it.</p><p>I did discover one thing through this whole process. Because of the password protection bug in Netgear&#039;s samba implementation, I decided to create a Truecrypt container on the samba share and mount that from my computer. This greatly speeds up writing of many small files, as I imagine Truecrypt is batching the encrypted blocks of data. So I may just go back to using the TP-Link since I was getting 10 MB/s or so</p>									</div>
