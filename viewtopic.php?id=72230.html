					<p>I installed OpenWrt on my R6100 this afternoon.&nbsp; It&#039;s way beyond my understanding and capabilities.&nbsp; Following direction, I also downloaded the OEM firmware from Netgear.&nbsp; When attempting to update/revert to OEM firmware (System &gt; backup/flash Firmware &gt; Flash New Firmware Image), I select the downloaded R6100 v1.0.1.14.img file and hit FLASH, it goes through an upload process then returns the following:</p><p>The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.</p><p>I don&#039;t know what else to do.&nbsp; Assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>The main current issue is that wireless is active, but not serving DHCP.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have set for Access point, but i dont think that&#039;s what I need.&nbsp; I need wireless to serve DHCP addresses so that the wireless devices can connect.</p>									</div>

					<p>DHCP should work over wifi the same that it does wired, since they are both in the lan bridge.&nbsp; Make sure that the IPv6 DHCP server on lan is turned off (it isn&#039;t by default), since that will confuse some client devices in an IPV4 only network.&nbsp; Edit the lan network settings, halfway down the page click the IPv6 tab and set everything to disabled.</p><p>A TFTP flash is the best way to revert to stock firmware.&nbsp; You will need a TFTP client for your PC.&nbsp; Hold down the reset button while you turn the power on, and keep holding it until the power LED flashes green.&nbsp; At this point the router is a TFTP server at 192.168.1.1 and you can push a stock firmware to it.&nbsp; This process works through the bootloader so it doesn&#039;t matter which firmware is presently installed.</p><p>If you want to stay with OpenWrt, use a LEDE build as the 5 GHz performance is much better.&nbsp; The R6100 works very well with LEDE.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 4 Oct 2017, 14:01)</p>

					<p>I would like to stay with OpenWrt, but my panic of not being able to connect wirelessly (I often telework, and I have no network drops in my &#039;office&#039; area engaged last night.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have used DDWRT years ago, and it seemed easier for dummies like me to use <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ll follow your guidance this evening when I get back home and verify/correct any settings, prior to attempting the tftp reflash to stock.<br />I&#039;ll look into this LEDE build (I&#039;m rather dumb to all of this stuff) and try to understand/learn what you are referring to.</p><p>Your response and info is greatly appreciated!</p><p>Rogan</p>									</div>
