					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have a Linksys WRT1900Ac (V1) router running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1</p><p>I would like to be able to connect directly to the internet most of the time, but on occasion, I&#039;d like to establish a&nbsp; wireless connection for one device that would be routed through a VPN.</p><p>Is there any way to set up a second access point on my router that would go through my VPN, while not directing all of my network traffic through it?</p><p>I&#039;m not ashamed to say that I&#039;m at the shallow end of the knowledge pool compared to most of you, so thanks in advance for you advice.</p>									</div>
