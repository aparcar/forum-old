					<p>You might be able to troubleshoot whether the problem is on the Asus or a client problem: do &quot;telnet asus 9100&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;You should see something like:<br />==<br />$ telnet 192.168.1.10 9100 &lt;--- use Asus IP here...<br />Trying 192.168.1.10...<br />Connected to&nbsp; (192.168.1.10).<br />Escape character is &#039;^]&#039;.<br />===<br />type some characters, then quit with CNTRL-].</p><p>Whatever you typed should be printed.</p><p>If nothing&#039;s printed, it&#039;s an Asus p910nd setup problem; otherwise, a client problem.</p><p>Just a suggestion, mayber worthless.</p>									</div>

					<p>We got exactly same situation, print job is spooling and disappearing, printer does not react at all. </p><p>Printer is HP LaserJet 1018, and router is Trendnet TEW-673GRU, which is identical hardware as D-link DIR-825, but has 2 USB ports.</p><p>Fist setup was perfect, everything worked after on router software enabled USB support, then enabled printing support. Printer was autopluged and recognized correctly, what could be seen with command:<br /># dmesg | grep usb</p><p>Windows computers were setup with Local printer/ Add port, type TCPIP, IP address of router (192.168.1.1) and port 9100, mode RAW.<br />Worked Perfect!</p><p>But then the problem appeared, when printer went out of paper. It just stopped printing, router reboot and printer power off and power on cycle didn&#039;t help at all.</p><p>And here is solution: you need to reinitialize printer!<br />To to this, you need to reload printer firmware to printer. </p><p>Fist you will need filesystem on router where you can put firmware file, I enabled JFFS2 support, and put firmware file on it:<br /># wget <a href="http://www.spmetas.lt/images/files/linux/sihp1018.dl.zip">http://www.spmetas.lt/images/files/linu â€¦ 018.dl.zip</a><br />unzip it:<br /># unzip sihp1018.dl.zip<br />clean:<br /># rm sihp1018.dl.zip</p><p>and manually reload firmware:<br /># cat /jffs/sihp1018.dl &gt;/dev/lp0</p><p>Your HP LaserJet 1018 printer will initialize and will be able to print again!!!</p><p>and finally put this line to router Startup commands script (Save startup).<br />So you can just reboot router to reinitialize printer.</p><p>That&#039;s all, happy printing! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
