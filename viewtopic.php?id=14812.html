					<p>I am using Ubuntu on desktop and I noticed today that I received a security update for lighttpd - the webserver I used to run on openwrt. I was just wandering, does OpenWRT provide any security patches at all? Or does it not affect OpenWRT? I do not want to criticise anyone, since I am aware that all this is volunteer work, I am just curious.</p>									</div>
