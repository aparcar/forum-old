You may be the first person to actually use this tool ;p. I definitely went overboard on polishing it as much as I did, but I hate to release half-baked stuff.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>But I didn&#039;t end up needing to use this anyway as vximgtoolgui.exe works fine with wine (I don&#039;t have a windows box) as I discovered eventually.</p></blockquote></div><p>Cool. I actually need to update that GUI tool so that it uses the new nvram modification code instead of the more brute-force mechanism it currently uses. But if it works no need to update it I guess <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />. Note that I never did update the starting CFE in that, so it&#039;s default nvram parameters are a bit older/different than the current CFE the vxworks_killer images use. This will change soon anyway as I switch to a compressed CFE to make avaialble at least 128KB more flash ROM space.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Also, a little bit off topic, the dd-wrt installation worked fine for me, but I couldn&#039;t get a working openwrt install - I tried to use <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/micro/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussi … uashfs.bin</a> - but after the tftp completed I just ended up with a blinking power light.

Otherwise, that should be a usable build though. For OpenWrt to be of any real use it needs to be micro-tized a lot, which compromises much of its design ideals. OpenWrt&#039;s philosophy just doesn&#039;t go well with size optimization. I am, of course, using OpenWrt for the VxWorks reversion firmwares, and it does work great for that specialized purpose.</p><p>I&#039;m working on a super-micro build of OpenWrt, but have many other things to do.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Anyway, now I have found use for 2 v5 boxes I &#039;accidentally&#039; bought last year which had been gathering dust on a shelf, so this is a result for me.

Once I get a GS unit and enable 16mb on it, at least these they will not have such issues.</p><p>Another issue is how OpenWrt mandates use of JFFS2 (or some other RW filesystem) instead of exclusively using the nvram for configuration data. Once could move configuration data into nvram, but the more you do such things, the more you undo what OpenWrt is. For micro Operating Systems so much is different. </p><p>I could try squeezing dropbear into dd-wrt when I expand the available flash ROM space by 128KB. I think Brainslayer is going to use this space for language files, though I&#039;m not sure. One issue with the micro builds of DD-WRT is there are so many different combinations of what packages a person might want that you can&#039;t build 100 different images. It&#039;d be awesome to have a firmware image packager like OpenWrt has.</p>									</div>
