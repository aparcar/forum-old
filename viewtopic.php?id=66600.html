					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a SX762 running for almost 2 years. Since 2 weeks the router reboots by its own. Sometimes after a few hour sometimes after 1 or 2 days.<br />I have unplugged all ethernet ports and only wifi is running.</p><p>After the reboot some services, such as uhttpd, odhcpd and dnsmaq (only dhcp, dns is started), are not coming up automaticly. I have to start them by hand. Enabling the service does not make any difference.</p><p>In the systemlog I see the following message. But doesnot seem to be related to the reboot.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sat Aug  6 12:09:08 2016 kern.warn kernel: [173092.252000] jffs2: Decompressor &quot;lzma&quot; returned -1

So upgrading the fireware could be resulting in a non reachable router.</p><p>Any clues?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wvdakker</strong> on 6 Aug 2016, 13:46)</p>
