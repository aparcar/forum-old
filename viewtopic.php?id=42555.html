					<p>I have an Asus WL-330GE. The stock f/w in WIFI Client mode fails to connect in many hotels because the MAC address of the initial connection is that of the Asus and that of subsequent ones&nbsp; the MAC address of my laptop. I previously used an Asus WL-330G which would clone the MAC address of the attached laptop so there was no problem. Unfortunately it fails to do WPA. The GE does WPA, but the idiots dropped the clone MAC address feature - even though it is still in the manual. :-(</p><p>I got around the problem then by putting OpenWRT on the GE running as a router with the WAN on the WIFI and the LAN on the wired connection and thereby NATting the laptop so the MAC mismatch went away.<br />&nbsp; <br />Having spent the last couple of weeks playing with OpenWRT on an Asus RT-N16 I was wondering if there was anything in straight client mode to clone the MAC address. It is not a problem in hotels but at home of course it cannot see my LAN.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>It is possible set mac of your choice even in client mode, but I don&#039;t know about &quot;automatic&quot; clonning. To set the mac in client mode, you have to specify mac for wan interface:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.wan.macaddr=00:11:22:33:44:55
uci commit
/etc/init.d/network restart</code></pre></div><p>In a wireless bridge mode, you will have to set mac directly to wifi using wireless.@wifi-iface[0].macaddr=00:11:22:33:44:55</p>									</div>
