					<p>Computer: OS X<br />Router: WRT1900AC v1<br />OpenWrt: 15.05.1</p><p>I recently installed version 15.05.1 of OpwnWrt onto a Linksys WRT1900AC v1 router. Using the LuCi interface, I set the root password and made no other changes. Now when trying to log into the router at 192.168.1.1 and entering a password, access is not granted due to wrong password.</p><p>I have read over the article posted on OpenWrt titled “OpenWrt Failsafe” but I’m not completely clear on some of the details and need advise please. I plan to boot into failsafe mode using the “flashing LED and pressing a button” approach, but have several questions about the setup and process that follows.</p><p>Q1. How do I set my Mac’s IP address to the recommend IP of 192.168.1.2? I have never manually set my computer&#039;s IP address, and assume it has always had it’s IP address assigned to it by the router automatically.</p><p>Q2. The router has five ports, four LAN and one WAN/Internet. Using a ethernet cable running from my computer, which port should I connect to?</p><p>Q3. Once Failsafe mode has been triggered, I need to send instructions to the router in order to reset the password. It’s my understanding that after setting a password for the root account, the telnet connection is disabled and you must connect via SSH. I’m using Mac OS X&nbsp; which has a built-in SSH client called Terminal. After launching Terminal, how do I connect to the router, and what are the sequence of commands to reset the root password?</p><p>Thank you for your help and advice.</p>									</div>
