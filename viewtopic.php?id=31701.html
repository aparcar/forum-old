					<p>I have a Netgear WNDR3300 with DDWRT on it. I would like to try OpenWRT but I don&#039;t see it listed in the hardware list. Does that mean I am out of luck? Is there a standard version of OpenWRT I can try installing and can it be done from DDWRT or would I have to reinstall the Netgear system? I&#039;m presently using a Linksys E3000 with DDWRT on it but I am considering changing, would like to try first on the Netgear router if possible to minimize inconvenience to others on my LAN.</p><p>Any suggestions or help appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,.</p><p>Bob Goodwin</p>									</div>

					<p>There are so many processor/chipset architectures, that there is not &quot;standard version&quot; suitable to all hardware. At least based on the wiki, WNDR3300 is not actively supported by the Openwrt community.</p><p>Based on an old Wiki article (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/netgear/wndr3300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … r/wndr3300</a>), it is a Broadcom 47xx based device. So, a suitable firmware might be found in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/</a><br />The generic one there might be <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … uashfs.trx</a> , but more probably trying to flash that might brick your device...</p><p>Stick to a firmware that you know should work in the device.</p>									</div>
