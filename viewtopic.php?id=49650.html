					<p>This has probably been asked before, is there a command that will switch to lock into the strongest signal instead of any signal? Or a command that will show you a list of all available signals? I am talking about cli</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hytecman</strong> on 21 Mar 2014, 20:17)</p>

					<p>Thanks a lot, this helps.&nbsp; Actually, these are repeaters on an entire WiFi network and the repeater/router seems to just jump from signal to signal, but not to locking onto a strong signal, like there is a bug in the software. Want to tell the repeater/router to lock onto the strongest signal it finds after scanning the available signals.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hytecman</strong> on 21 Mar 2014, 21:46)</p>
