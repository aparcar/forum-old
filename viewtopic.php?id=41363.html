					<p>Hi all,</p><p>This is my first time using OpenWrt. I have a TP-Link WR703N in client mode, with an Arduino Uno connected to its USB port. I want to run ser2net on the WR703N so I can access the serial interface of the Arduino remotely. I have it mostly working, but when I use telnet on my laptop to connect to ser2net on the WR703N, the telnet connection just kind of dies after a while. Sometimes I can continue writing, sometimes I can&#039;t, but reading always fails.</p><p>In another thread, I read about an issue with another TP-Link router, where, in order to work reliably, serial interfaces required the insertion of a USB 2.0 hub between the USB-to-Serial module and the router. I tried that, and it works! Been blinking a LED and reading temperature data off it at a 1s interval continuously for a couple days now as a stress test.</p><p>From what I can gather, the issue is that the Arduino is a USB 1 device, and the Atheros chip REQUIRES a USB 2.0 device, so connecting a USB 2.0 hub solves the problem. Is this correct?</p><p>I&#039;d like to put together 10+ of these WR703N &amp; Arduino combos for home automation. This means I&#039;ll also have a bunch of bulky hubs to fit in the final case. To keep the physical size of the final units as small as possible, I&#039;m considering just buying bare ATMega328s and assembling my own Arduinos, which wouldn&#039;t be too difficult. But this leaves the issue of the USB interface.</p><p>If my assumption about the USB 1 incompatibility being the root of the problem is correct, using a USB 2.0 capable serial to USB module should eliminate the need for a hub, right? I found this one on eBay that says it&#039;s USB 2.0, and should be supported by kmod-usb-pl2303: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/PL2303-USB2-0-to-RS232-TTL-Converter-Module-4-x-cable-/290602482513?pt=US_Video_Cables_Adapters&amp;hash=item43a941fb51">http://www.ebay.com/itm/PL2303-USB2-0-t … 43a941fb51</a></p><p>It&#039;ll take a couple weeks to reach me for testing, so in the meantime I was wondering if I&#039;m on the right track. Does anyone have experience with a true USB 2.0 to serial module that I could use for my DIY-Arduinos, and eliminate the bulky hubs?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>PS: If anyone else is interested in a project like this, I&#039;m using a Ruby gem called &#039;dino&#039; on my server for communicating with the remote Arduinos: <a href="https://github.com/austinbv/dino">https://github.com/austinbv/dino</a></p><p>It&#039;s early days for this gem, but it&#039;s been working great so far, and I&#039;ve written a TxRx class that connects over telnet instead of a local serial device (all the gem currently does). Will push it to my Github account and submit a pull request shortly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the clarification Squonk.

Here are the results of my testing in case anyone else is trying to figure out the seemingly random behavior:</p><p>1) I can connect to ser2net reliably if my laptop is hooked up to the Ethernet port on the WR703N, and the Arduino is connected directly to to the WR703N USB (no hub), and WiFi is disabled.</p><p>2) For the previous setup, but with WiFi enabled (i.e. WiFi enabled, but still connecting to ser2net over Ethernet), it&#039;s more reliable than connecting over WiFi, it just takes much longer to die. Adding the hub to this setup makes it reliable.</p><p>3) In order to make ser2net anything near reliable while connecting over WiFi, the USB 2.0 hub is necessary.</p><p>Now I&#039;m considering soldering directly to the serial port on the WR703N board. I&#039;ve been trying to avoid this, since I&#039;ve never soldered anything that small before, but it&#039;ll make the final design even simpler I guess. Just need some practice first.</p><p>Thanks for all the help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the soldering advice Squonk. I will try both: soldering onto the board, and taking apart a small USB hub that will fit into the case. I was ordering some cables from monoprice.com the other day when I noticed this one which looks pretty small:</p><p><a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=103&amp;cp_id=10307&amp;cs_id=1030702&amp;p_id=6631&amp;seq=1&amp;format=6#faq">http://www.monoprice.com/products/produ … rmat=6#faq</a></p><p>so I got one to try out. Should have it by next week. W.r.t. using the built in serial interface, U-Boot shouldn&#039;t be an issue, since it will be out of the way by the time ser2net runs. I can probably get away with disabling the Linux console on the serial interface as well, since these are going to be purpose built little boxes.</p><p>On another note, my UNO works perfectly. But recently I got a Nano ATMEGA328 (not an &quot;original&quot; Gravitech, but it has a true FTDI FT232RL chip). I&#039;ll sometimes have to connect it to WR703N&#039;s hub multiple times for it to be recognized, and even then it&#039;s just as unreliable as the UNO when the UNO is connected directly.</p><p>If I hook the nano to either my MacBook or Ubuntu server and use ser2net, it works just fine. The only thing that&#039;s really changed when going from UNO to Nano on the WR703N is the use of&nbsp; kmod-usb-serial-ftdi instead of kmod-usb-serial-acm for the USB-to-serial interface. Could this be the culprit?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vixm</strong> on 5 Jan 2013, 00:13)</p>
