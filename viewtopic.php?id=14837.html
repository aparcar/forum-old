					<p>Hi,</p><p>IÂ´m totally new to OpenWrt and searching for a possibility to setup a HotSpot System.<br />I have already thought about how the setup shoukd look like:</p><br /><p>HotSpot----Modem------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;_______<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />HotSpot----Modem--------------|&nbsp; &nbsp;WWW |------------Web &amp; RADIUS Server<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |_______|<br />HotSpot----Modem------</p><br /><p>Okay itÂ´s just to get a quick look at what i have in mind.<br />I would like to setup several HotSpots for example in hotels. Every HotSpot owner should have the possibility to manage his HotSpot User on a central<br />RADIUS server. <br />This server should also contain the redirection and login page for the users. </p><p>I have found several keywords like chillispot, coovachilli freeradius and deloradius.</p><p>Maybe here is somebody around who has already a setup like the one i want to install and can give some good advice.</p><p>IÂ´m happy about every hint i can get about the topic and for example which programms are the best!</p><p>Thanks, draught</p>									</div>

					<p>Incorrect again. It is a free service for non-commercial use and the software is opensource. And it is certainly relevant to the original question. Please check out your facts before you make allegations of spam.<br />Here goes a shorter format, that you seem to prefer:</p><p>Consider Chillifire as the web management platform for managing routers, users, provisioning, accounting records, payment gateways etc.</p><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/chillifire/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/chillifire/</a></p><br /><p>Regards,</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, accepted, though it wasn&#039;t really made obvious by the website you linked to. <br />Maybe you should actually put a link to the sourceforge page on chillifire.net, because that page neither mentions where to find the source code, nor that the software is based on OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, looking at it some more, I just noticed that you also only put binaries on that sourceforge page, no source code there either.<br />Could you please fix that before announcing your stuff here?</p>									</div>
