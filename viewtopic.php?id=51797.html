					<p>Hello,</p><p>My group developed a software controller for OpenWRT APs (github.com/sci-fi). We want to do a very high density install at my University, with at least one AP in each classroom. To make the most of available BW, it would be nice if we could limit the users to high rate associations, so a wandering user would not stick to an AP, dropping to a low-rate/high-air-time connection. All our APs in each area have the same SSID and are in the same LAN, so roaming is seamless. But devices that do not switch APs when they should hurt total throughput.</p><p>We think that if we could advertise only high rates in the beacons then devices would voluntarily switch APs more often when moving. Does anyone know how to do that?</p><p>&nbsp; --schara</p>									</div>

					<p>The logic a device uses to switch APs is purely client side and you have no control over it. If a client does not roam it&#039;s either because it cannot, or because of badly designed drivers/daemons, in neither case can you influence it. I know of no clients whatsoever that roam based on rates broadcast in beacons, so changing advertised rates wouldn&#039;t make any difference. This is a major omission in the 802.11 MAC and a huge problem with all wifi kit, even the biggest vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Ubiquity, Ruckus, etc.) haven&#039;t got a clean solution to the problem.</p><p>The only real way around this is proprietary single-BSSID solutions like Meru and Extricom which throw half the 802.11 stack out the window.</p><p>Personally I&#039;ve been meaning to develop a similar system based on Openwrt for a while now but the amount of modifications to the driver, mac80211 stack and CAPWAP made it too difficult. Then again these companies wouldn&#039;t be selling their solutions for hundreds of thousands of dollars if it were easy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 25 Jul 2014, 01:13)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your answer. I think I was not clear in my question. I know that the AP has no control over what the clients do. In fact,&nbsp; if you force a client to disassociate it will often, if not always, come back to the same AP.</p><p>What I want to do is to advertise in my beacons only the higher rates, so a client will only connect if it can maintain that rate. Is there a way to change what is advertised in the beacons?</p><p>&nbsp; --schara</p>									</div>

					<p>Like I said, this won&#039;t achieve your desired effect, and will not work. Yes, you can change the rates advertised in beacons, however changing the rates advertised in the beacons has no effect on the rate a client will eventually use. A client pays no attention to the advertised rates when deciding whether to connect or not. A client also cannot know in advance if it can maintain connection at a given rate or not. It is not really possible to make a client &#039;only connect if it can maintain that rate&#039;, and trying to do so will probably <em>increase</em> noise and interference in your network.</p><p>You would have to rewrite the rate control algorithm (minstrel_ht) to prevent clients using less than a certain rate after it is connected, but given most sub-laptop battery powered devices automatically drop to 6Mbps or less when idle/screen off, this is likely to cause more problems than it solves. IIRC the ratemask debug options don&#039;t work properly with ath9k so your only choices are a single fixed rate for all devices or full-auto. There is no standard interface for consistent user-space rate control, so your only options are debugfs or rewriting the driver. And even those options will vary by AP chipset and so forth.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 25 Jul 2014, 02:05)</p>

					<p>Ok, assume I am in a University (which I am) and I can write a paper proving what you said :-) You wrote:</p><p> -- Yes, you can change the rates advertised in beacons,</p><p>My question is: How?</p><p>&nbsp; --schara</p><p>PS. I agree with you. It is just that proving something won&#039;t work is a valid paper, and closes an avenue of research.

					<p>Repeating what&#039;s already been proven in existing, non-controversial, and already accepted peer reviewed papers isn&#039;t really a valid research proposal though. Meanwhile real academics are busy studying things we don&#039;t already know, instead of repeating projects done by 2nd year undergraduates. Anyway, I digress.</p><p>You can set the basic rates advertised in a beacon using the basic_rate list directive in Openwrt&#039;s wireless config. This only works for certain drivers and only works to change the 802.11a/g rates, not N or AC. It does not change the extended rates or HT or VHT MCS indices advertised.</p><p>You can also edit the hostapd.conf file manually and define supported_rates but again that does not modify HT or VHT rates so is largely ignored by minstrel_ht.</p><p>There is no way to change advertised 802.11n/ac rates without modifying either hostapd, the driver, or minstrel_ht.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 25 Jul 2014, 03:26)</p>

					<p>Thank you. As you are so kind, can you point me to the papers that you think support your affirmations? But as you know, and I have seen by capturing beacons, setting basic_rate list has no effect on the list of rates advertised, at least for the Atheros AR9330 driver I am using. If it were so obvious, I would not be wasting your time. The command fails silently, no error is returned, but it does nothing. I thought this list could point me to something more useful.</p>									</div>
