					<p>I also used terra term some weeks ago with the following steps to recover:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1. You need to set the hardware into UART mode by modifying the following pads during startup:

    * Shortcut R80 (for example with a screwdriver)
    * and bring +3.3V on the left side of R65 (for example with the voltage from the serial port)
    
    If the UART    is activated, you will see:

        ROM VER: 1.0.3
        CFG 04
        Read EEPROMX
        X
        UART

2. After that you have to remove the shortcut and the voltage on R65, otherwise you can not upload.
3. Upload U-boot (u-boot.asc) with TeraTerm (just send, no xmodem or ymodem).
   U-boot will start automatically.</code></pre></div><p>After that I flashed brnboot depending on the u-boot version with ubootwrite.py, tftpd or loadx.</p>									</div>

					<p>I flashed OpenWRT on another easybox a few days ago - and bricked bootloader when trying to install uboot.<br/>I used uboot.asc referenced in 2nd post here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=214995#p214995">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 95#p214995</a> to debrick device. It has xmodem/ymodem built in, so uploading uboot image by serial was easy. Look for loadx command reference - load it to ram (same address as through original bootloader) and then copy to flash.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure if this is going to be helpful, but I&#039;ve aleady bricked one of my four Easyboxes a couple of times and have collected some experience in the meantime.</p><p>If you have a helping hand available (actually you&#039;d need two helping hands), you can do the job without any soldering. The UART mode has only got to be initiated for a short moment...once it says UART on the terminal window you can forget about the neccessary connections. That means: Let some other person realize the shortcut of R80 with something conductive, while you bring 3.3V to the left side of R65 and then power on the Easybox (using a switched socket-outlet). As soon as you can read UART on the console you can relax and remove everything (except the power, of course).</p><p>I used to send a <strong>u-boot.asc</strong> to the Easybox&#039;s RAM using TeraTerm and once it is uploaded and starts automatically I normally use <strong>loady</strong> to reinstall the complete backup of the original firmware (which does take some time, of course).</p><p>So be patient!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, it made me pull out my hair, but i&#039;m in a running state now. (seems like tftp got some problems with transfering the image) after several writing errors over serial, i tried with tftpboot an was satisfied with the speed. but at first i killed the bootloader again with (i think) the &quot;erase 0xb0020000 0xb07effff&quot; command from the guide (I#m useing the uboot from SNK wich is a litle bit bigger, so i think this caused the problems) but now i have a booting openWRT.

					<p>Yeah, meanwhile I noticed that having identical MAC addresses does cause unneccessary problems. I wasn&#039;t prepared to run into this, so I didn&#039;t prepare the Easyboxes to avoid it. Meanwhile I managed to have different MAC addresses although the boxes have identical images installed. Will have to see if I manage to get it do what I want now.</p>									</div>

If you do not want to change the image, you have to find someone who install the source with the same image release as snk and generate the kmod files.</p><p>But you can also install the image from the snapshot <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/lantiq/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/lantiq/</a> with all related modules and configure it, which seems currently even newer than my image, or you use the image I have posted in the past. It might be compatible to the one from snk, so perhaps you can keep your settings. Then I can create the suitable kmod files for you.</p>									</div>
