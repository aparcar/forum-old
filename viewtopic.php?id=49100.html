					<p>Hi,</p><p>are you succeed by buiding this package for openwrt?<br />i have a wndr3700 with openwrt and also like to use LMS on it (i have several squeezebox boom).</p><p>thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>LMS would simply be to big for a lot of routers. The ARM binary for Netgear ReadyNAS devices is over 20 MB. The WNDR3700 only has 8 MB of flash available. Next to that, you would also need quite a lot of RAM. LMS also maintains a database with metadata of all indexed media files, so that also needs some space and is updated frequently (which will wear out flash memory). So, for routers, this is a no-go. </p><p>Maybe, if you have a NAS device with OpenWRT on it, you could build LMS for it, but my guess is your hardware options would be pretty limited (I don&#039;t know the Pogoplug device). I would definately suggest a regular harddisk or SSD to install LMS on.</p><p>If you want to stream music/video from your router, you would be much better off with <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">MiniDLNA</a>. This still requires several MB of flash, but it is doable on devices with 8 MB of flash and at least 64 MB RAM (if the number of media files is limited - MiniDLNA keeps its database in RAM).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>avbohemen</strong> on 2 Jun 2014, 13:44)</p>

					<p>hi @rymn, sorry no luck yet. I managed to contact the author of the PKGBUILD but he had no experience with OpenWRT. Also as @avbohemen pointed out, there is no way LMS will run on a MIPS based router in any usable way.</p><p>LMS on the Pogoplug under Arch Linux isn&#039;t bad, but its a little sluggish navigating a large library though.</p><p>One day...</p><p>KK</p>									</div>
