					<p>The password doesn&#039;t seem to work for telnet or ssh, just su and ftp. Iptables has a BACKDOOR rule. Rolled new firmware with lots of mistakes, like not setting permissions on busybox correctly, still booted, couldn&#039;t su. Assuming I didn&#039;t know the admin password, would clobbering shadow via ftp work or I just can&#039;t make a salted shadow to replace it?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>occupymyday</strong> on 24 Jan 2016, 18:02)</p>

					<p>According to the system log, some curious stranger was able to login after 10 tries via telnet, maybe they broke the default salted passwords. Contrary to the web gui settings, telnet seems to run at boot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good work on the su password.&nbsp; I was working on a different approach, after looking for web vulnerabilities on the ping utility I was starting to dissect the firmware upgrade and looking for a way in.</p><p>Your way was much easier! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The reason that you can&#039;t use that account to ssh is that the ssh agent does a lookup by appending _404A03SSH to the user name when you try to login.&nbsp; Ftp name mangles it as well and so does Tel.</p><p>You can verify this by creating a new user called test like this:</p><p># adduser -h /root -s /bin/sh -H test_404A03SSH</p><p>and then try to login via ssh with ssh test@192.168.0.1</p><p>your password will work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there. Sorry to revive an old thread, do you guys have an explanation on how to sign in, like what username, etc? I&#039;ve tried admin, root, admin_404A03SSH, root_404A03SSH, and the password OP said doesn&#039;t work. I&#039;m using PuTTY, and I&#039;ve tried both Telnet and SSH. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry for waking up an ancient thread.</p><p>But. We just got a new PK5001Z (to replace an EQ-660R, ancient!), and I&#039;d like to poke around with it a bit. I have decent knowledge of C, good knowledge of Linux workings, and some hardware hacking knowledge. Is there any particular reason that OpenWrt isn&#039;t available for the PK5001Z yet? AFAIK, that is the standard router given out by CenturyLink nowadays, and it&#039;d be awesome to have OpenWrt for it.</p><p>Also, the root password is still z y a d 5 0 0 1, and the user and admin passwords are both CenturyL.</p>									</div>

					<p>In response to recent IoT botnet attacks (<a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/internet-of-things/new-mirai-variant-found-spreading-like-wildfire">https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/sec â€¦ e-wildfire</a>), it appears that CenturyLink/ZyXEL has rolled a new firmware out remotely (compiled December 4th) without asking anyone or updating their website. It seems they changed all the passwords (root and to the super-secret support console at <a href="http://192.168.0.1/supportconsole_login.cgi">http://192.168.0.1/supportconsole_login.cgi</a>), and now the file that sets all the passwords (/lib/be_modules/libberemotemgmt6.so) no longer has the passwords in plaintext. New libberemotemgmt6.so file is at <a href="https://my.mixtape.moe/oftykr.so">https://my.mixtape.moe/oftykr.so</a> if anyone wants to try reverse-engineering it to see how it sets the passwords; too lazy to get a MIPS toolchain running to disassemble it.</p><p>The old web interface hack to get root still works: log in and go to <a href="http://192.168.0.1/pingtrace.cgi?pingSize=32&amp;pingAddr=%60passwd%20-d%20root%60">http://192.168.0.1/pingtrace.cgi?pingSi â€¦ %20root%60</a></p><p>sorry this post is a mess</p><p>EDIT: An old post about this router/modem combo got deleted for some reason; it was at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43210">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43210</a>. I&#039;m guessing this was unintentional (lost in transition to new forum software maybe), but could a moderator or administrator please look up this post? I would like to see what was in it again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hitechcomputergeek</strong> on 7 Jan 2018, 01:01)</p>
