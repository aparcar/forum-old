					<p>Some of the default rules for the firewall seem a little strange to me.</p><p>Two examples are the DHCP and DHCPv6 traffic rules that allow DHCP traffic from the WAN to the device.</p><p>My training and experience tell me that I should accept no unsolicited traffic from the WAN unless I am offering a service (HTTP, SMTP ...). Furthermore such traffic should be directed at hardened targets that reside on on a seperate network (DMZ, server farm ...).</p><p>My question is why are these rules setup this way.</p><p>John A</p>									</div>

					<p>My understanding, after reading the two tickets mentioned, is that these rules are for routers who pick up their WAN address via DHCP(v6).<br />If I am wrong please enlighten me.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jow wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I hope your security training also told you that it doesn&#039;t matter whether a port is firewalled or not if no service is listening behind it.</p></blockquote></div><p>My training tells me that any unused port should be closed for both ingress and egress, not doing so may provide an opportunity for mischief. Furthermore, such ports should be &quot;stealthed&quot; (they should not respond in anyway to activity directed at them).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zzz2002</strong> on 22 Jan 2012, 15:50)</p>

					<p>I do not particularly like the term but it does describe the desired outcome fairly well, a port that is completely non-responsive to any probe or activity. <br />I think I picked the term up from <a href="http://www.grc.com/intro.html">Gibson Research</a> they use it in their shields up service. It categorizes the result of a port scan in term that most non-techies will understand.</p><p>In practical terms it just means no forwarding between zones except under the control RW rules and using DROP rather than REJECT as both policy and targets in iptables.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zzz2002</strong> on 22 Jan 2012, 22:35)</p>
