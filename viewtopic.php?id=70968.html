					<p>so ive been trying several different systems with wrt mainly with the rtl8187 (alfa branded all).<br />im having every now and then a local connection but no internet. <br />nothing fixes this but a reboot.. very random.</p><p>ive read in other topics this is due to the 8187 kernel module driver.</p><p>i also have a 8188EU and 8188RU, generally the 8187 outperforms all.</p><p>i also only managed once to get the other cards working because on both lately ive been having something like:<br />driver failing to load error -11</p><p>maybe its because i also had the 8187 driver installed simoultanious? dont remember must try.. anyone any experience?</p><p>is there any fix for my problem? it is extremely annoying to have so frequent drops.</p><p>so to make things clear the system is functioning as an extender/repeater with a wireless card setup as a wwan for internet</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrt8</strong> on 20 May 2017, 22:26)</p>
