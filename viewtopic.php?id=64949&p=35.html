					<p>@davidc502</p><p>Once again, thanks for the good work!<br />I think you need to take a look at the latest r2685. I believe opkg is broken.

					<p>Need a little help. TIA.</p><p>Linksys WRT1900ACS v2</p><p>A while back, maybe 6 weeks or so ago, I installed one of davidc502&#039;s builds. It seemed to be working okay but I messed it up. There is some learning going on here. Needing things back in operation, I did the 3 REBOOTS method to take the router back to stock firmware.</p><p>I now have more time to investigate giving it another shot. It isn&#039;t clear to me how to proceed.</p><p>I am operating with stock (Linksys) firmware. Since the time that I installed davidc502&#039;s build, a new Linksys firmware was released. I installed it from the Linksys partition I was booted from.</p><p>I&#039;ve noticed in my reading that setting settings to default is a good thing but in my case, how would I do that and is it necessary? I don&#039;t even know if the davidc502 build is on the other partition now since I installed a new stock firmware.</p><p>Any help for this newb is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>@nick59</strong></p><p>If you flashed/upgraded a Linksys firmware while on Linksys firmware, you&#039;ll have the newer version of Linksys FW on one partition and the older one on the other. If you flash the new Linksys firmware again, then you&#039;d have the latest version on both. </p><p>There&#039;s an option in the Linksys firmware to reset to defaults, but that would only affect the Linksys FW on the partition you are currently using. Its not needed before flashing LEDE/Open-WRT anyway. </p><p>If you want to start using @david&#039;s LEDE builds, simply flash the appropriate factory.img file (not the sysupgrade.bin file) from @david&#039;s website using the Linksys web interface at 192.168.1.1 (if you&#039;ve recently ran LEDE, you may need to clear your browser cache to get the Linksys interface to load correctly). </p><p>Once you do that, you will have @david&#039;s build on the primary partition and the Linksys FW on the secondary/backup partition. When @david releases a new build, the best way to upgrade so that you keep the Linksys partition as a backup, is to use the method that you&#039;ll find at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=347359#p347359">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 59#p347359</a>. </p><p>If you use the sysupgrade.bin file and flash from Luci or SSH, it&#039;ll overwrite the stock Linksys FW and you&#039;ll have @david&#039;s older build on the secondary partition, and the new build you just flashed on the primary. </p><br /><p><strong>@david</strong><br />Latest build is working perfectly. No issues installing packages. Also, I was being lazy and simply flashed the sysupgrade.bin from Luci. Worked fine. Didn&#039;t have to SSH and use the -F switch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 29 Dec 2016, 07:38)</p>

That script wouldn&#039;t work anyway, as it tries to determine the CPU temp by looking at /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2, which doesn&#039;t exist on wrt1200ac. There&#039;s only hwmon0 and 1.</p><p>Plus a couple of further issues which I have forgotten. :-(</p><p>Let me know if you want me to report here, or if you have a bug tracker.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Ralf</p>									</div>
