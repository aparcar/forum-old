					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I am trying to remotely connect to my OpenWRT Router through reverse SSH from a Linux Virtual machine that is on a different network. Both OpenWRT router and my Linux VM have firewalls on their networks. I have set my OpenWRT and Linux VM&#039;s IP to be static. </p><p>So, on OpenWRT, I run the command &quot;ssh -R 12345:(openwrt IP):22 (Linux VM IP) However, when I run the command, I get these errors: </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ssh: Couldn&#039;t set SO_PRIORITY (Bad file descriptor)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ssh: Exited: Error connecting: No route to host</p><p>Note: I have not messed with any network config files on Linux or OpenWRT to allow incoming connections or anything. That could be what I&#039;m missing (pure guess). Could someone verify this suspicion? </p><p>My guess was that some firewall is blocking the connection, but I have port forwarding setup on my Linux VM network and local firewalls have been turned off on both Windows + Linux VM and OpenWRT router. Any ideas???</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>supergeen</strong> on 9 Dec 2016, 22:07)</p>

					<p>I noticied I did not have openssh server install on my Linux machine, so I was not listening on port 22.
