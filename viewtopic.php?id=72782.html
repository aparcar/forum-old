					<p>I have a HooToo AC 1200 and I am wondering if there is a build for my router. There is a bunch of info here that was previously researched at this link |&nbsp; forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67464 | (sorry im not allowed links)</p><p>But there was no conclusion to that thread.&nbsp; This is a great little router and would be even greater with OWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ADiAstra</strong> on 14 Dec 2017, 15:38)</p>

					<p>I bought the HooToo HT-ND001 router (MT7621-based) about 2 weeks ago. I soldered UART connections and then tftp&#039;d a LEDE snapshot for the Linksys re6500 - it was only one that didn&#039;t hang. However, some of the LEDs are not showing the proper status and LAN/WAN ports setup needed to be modified. I compiled my own version using the LEDE SDK (MT7621) and edited a few configuration files. Everything seems to work but the LEDs remain a problem. In a few days, I&#039;ll finish up my analysis and submit a question to the LEDE/OpenWRT forum. I hope this info helps in some manner.</p>									</div>
