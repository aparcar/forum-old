					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am handling a huge project involving creating a widely implemented WiFi Hots spot systems, while using Ubiquity thin APs and implementing their controller based system is a good choice, However as this is big project i am in need for cheaper solutions and non proprietary hardware cos you have to use their hardware of course with the software controller</p><p>Any body knows an open source that facilitates creating a wireless APs controller compatible with OpenWrt, any body has an implementation with CAPWAP Protocol</p><p>Your support will be much appreciated guys</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>UniFi controller has a lot of drawbacks. UniFi controllers functionality you can do yourself, especially in case it is for such a huge project.<br />Otherwise, use openmesh.com APs, connected to cheap routers, like mikrotik. OMs are &quot;Plug and Play&quot;, and their cloudtrax management you get for free.</p><p>In case, you need somebody to help to modify OMs FW (rev. 481), which is based on openwrt, ask me :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi </p><p>I know this is an old post but I came across it yesterday :-)</p><p>This is more in case someone also land here through Google...</p><p>You are welcome to look at the RADIUSdesk project which include two sub projects<br /></p><ul><li><p>MESHdesk</p></li><li><p>APdesk</p></li></ul><p><a href="http://www.radiusdesk.com/">http://www.radiusdesk.com/</a></p><p>You can now source those $10 Mediatek devices from China and have them centrally controlled either as APs or as mesh networks (Much like Cloudtrax but now under your own control and with some added features not included with Cloudtrax)</p><p>And since it is OpenSource the code is available to tweak.</p><p>We also added support for 802.11AC based Atheros devices recently and so far the meshes been rock solid using Ath10K. (These devices goes for just over 50USD for decent quality ones)</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
