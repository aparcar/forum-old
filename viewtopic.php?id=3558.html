					<p>I&#039;m trying to find old Linksys firmware for my WRT54GS V4 box.&nbsp; It&#039;s my first time trying to flash non-Linksys firmware and, if I understand correctly, I need to downgrade my firmware (came with 1.05.2, I found 1.05.0) to an even older version to exploit the ping hack to set the boot_wait to........</p><p>Am I missing something?&nbsp; OK - I KNOW I&#039;m missing something.&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched, browsed LS&#039;s ftp, and pounded my head.&nbsp; If someone can show mercy to this poor fool, I&#039;d greatly appreciate it.</p><p>-Saro</p>									</div>

					<p>with RC4, I am fairly sure you can grab the micro version and just do an upgrade via the web interface under &quot;firmware upgrade&quot;.&nbsp; I know on my first go at this, I actually grabbed the dd-wrt mini version first, and upgraded to that firmware via the linksys interface.&nbsp; Then I realized dd-wrt wasn&#039;t everything I wanted and came to OpenWrt.&nbsp; Once I had the dd-wrt one installed, I was able to use the dd-wrt&#039;s interface to install the full version of OpenWrt.&nbsp; I think you should be able to grab the OpenWrt Micro firmware and once that is installed from the linksys interface, grab the full version and tftp it up there.</p><p>I am using a WRT54GS v4 like yourself.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>in my opinion you don&#039;t need an older firmware.<br />Just got to the webinterface of linksys firmware an upload an OpenWRT jffs2 image.<br />It will work. I&#039;ve tried it with an WRT54GS v4.0 an v3.0 Router.</p><p>Bye</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>I am apparently no longer seeking old firmware.</p><p>At least with the 1.05.0 LS firmware I was able to upgrade using the browser based UI with no problems.</p><p>Incidentally, the 1.05.0 firmware DID allow the ping exploit using the ping_times variation.&nbsp; Dunno if later 1.05.x versions actually did or not.&nbsp; I kinda took what was written as gospel.&nbsp; Given that I didn&#039;t need to even go through that whole ordeal.....</p><p>JohnDoe-</p><p>That link (the first place I went when I first got the router) does not provide old firmware - just the most current.&nbsp; LS&#039;s ftp server does have the 1.05.0 firmware if ya dig a little though.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m up on OpenWRT.&nbsp; Now to get pptpd working....</p><p>-Saro</p>									</div>
