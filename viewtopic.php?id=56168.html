					<p>The device had hanged and it won&#039;t respond so I had to reboot it and as you said all the files on / drive were deleted and so were /overlay/upper/usr/lib folder and its files.</p><p>So the device never booted after that reboot.</p><p>No network lights nor ethernet connection.</p><p>I suspect I just bricked the device .. or is there a way to escape from this situation and reinstall openwrt ?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>you only fucked up the overlay-partition, the firmware is still ok. <br />So booting into failsafe and erase the overlay-partion (or its content) should do the trick: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 9 Mar 2015, 22:11)</p>

					<p>4MB flash just isn&#039;t enough for what you want to do. </p><p>the overlay partition is the only writeable partiton and it&#039;s only 768K big, that&#039;s just not enough for rtorrent and all its dependencies. <br />normally I would recommend building your own image including rtorrent, but it won&#039;t fit either. <br />So get a device with 8MB (or more) flash.</p>									</div>
