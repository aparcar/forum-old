					<p>This is 2.4... I would prefer to get it working on 2.6, but as the b43team is more or less silent on this, I prefer to stick to 2.4 so that we have a hope to get wifi.</p><p>Latest news are: still a lot of work for proper vlan handling... I&#039;d like to merge the dd-wrt version directly, as they seem to have quite a lot of recent fixes following some broadcom information releases. But I don&#039;t know how it will be perceived by openwrt devs, as they have made some cleanup and removed dependency for some broadcom specific functions. I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve enough knowledge to merge both cleanly.</p><p>One of my goals remains to be able to merge in openwrt, otherwise I would have gone dd directly... They also seem to have quite a lot of patches on the mips level for handling of some wifi chip specificities. It will certainly be necessary.</p><p>Got some discussions on IRC, but no specific help on the driver itself... </p><p>Anyway this first ping reply has been a nice reward after quite some time spent on this box...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sentenza</strong> on 30 Jun 2009, 16:24)</p>

					<p>I have a WRT610N and I am very much looking for third party firmware (I&#039;ve already filled all the available port forward slots and need more!).

					<p>thanks vinicius.vbf - I just checked changeset in trac - it wasn&#039;t so thorough.. Anyway - this is just great - I bought this device with high hopes about it and openwrt and finally it seems that we are getting somewhere as I don&#039;t have skills and/or tools for soldering serials and so on - I cannot nearly do anything about anything. So maybe I soon might open package again as I have checked it out only once or twice merely to just see that there&#039;s everything in the box that&nbsp; there should to be..</p>									</div>
