					<p>As far as I know, and as far as google tells me, I&#039;m the first person to get openwrt booted on the Netgear WGR614v10.</p><p>Apologies if I&#039;m behind the times. I&#039;ve never even used Openwrt before, so I have more work to do <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><br /><p>Step 1: (optional) Upgrade router to latest official firmware. I&#039;m not sure if you have to, but it&#039;s what I did.<br />Step 2: Download firmware from this site. Filename is &quot;openwrt-brcm47xx-mips74k-netgear-wnr-1000-v3-squashfs.chk&quot;<br />Step 3: Follow instructions here: <a href="http://www.aisenlink.com/2015/05/14/wgr614v10-wnr1000v3-cross-flashing-part2.html">http://www.aisenlink.com/2015/05/14/wgr â€¦ part2.html</a> to hack the board id of the firmware you just downloaded<br />Step 4: Disconnect from all other networks and connect to netgear directly through lan cable. (I have a linksys at 192.168.1.1, so I couldn&#039;t be on the internet and tinker at the same time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> )<br />Step 5: Use the neatgear web software to flash firmware.<br />Step 6: Wait a few minutes and try not to sweat too hard.<br />Step 7: Login through ssh and try not to get too smug</p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/lvGcUyb">http://imgur.com/lvGcUyb</a></p><p>That&#039;s it really. I have no idea what to do past the ascii art and the drink recipe.</p>									</div>

					<p>UPDATE</p><p>While the issue of &quot;Can you?&quot; for the WGR614v10 has been settled, the issue of &quot;Should you?&quot; is still up in the air.</p><p>Wireless isn&#039;t working out of the box. And it appears to have been bricked after attempting to reflash it with a different image, and failsafes are not working.</p><p>Thanks the the guys at the irc channel for being super helpful.</p>									</div>
