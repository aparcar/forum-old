					<p>HI, <br />I&#039;ve 2 WDR7500 routers. Router2 is running&nbsp; BB RC3. Router 2&#039;S&nbsp; Lan 1 port is connected to Router1 on lan port 1. Router 2 has static IP and I can access this within LAN. </p><p>Router 1 is connected to internet.&nbsp; It has got factory firmware</p><p>Problem : I am unable to access internet over Router 2.&nbsp; It is critical because I run transmission application on this router which is failing to connect and I tried to update software list that is failing too. </p><p>Please help me with the configuration that will allow me to have internet access on Router 2 as well. </p><p>I had to do this setup becasue I am running Factory firmware on Router 1 for WiFi N access while running NAS on Router 2 with transmission application to download.&nbsp; I thought Router 2 will be able to access internet if I connect both of them on lan port 1. It is not working. </p><p>ANY HELP WILL BE GRATELY APPRECIATED</p>									</div>

					<p>you must be do that:</p><p>about network:</p><p>Router 1&nbsp; WAN port ---&gt;internet<br />Router 2 WAN port ----&gt; Router 1 LAN ports(1-4)</p><p>about setting:</p><p>&nbsp; 1: set the Router 1&nbsp; LAN port setting : IP is 192.168.1.1 mask is 255.255.252.0<br />&nbsp; 2: set the Router 2 WAN port setting :static IP as 192.168.1.(2-254)and mask 255.255.252.0 gateway is&nbsp; Router 1 IP(default is&nbsp; 192.168.1.1) <br />&nbsp; 3: set the Router 2 LAN port setting : IP is 192.168.2.1 mask is 255.255.252.0<br />&nbsp; 4: set the Router 2 DHCP service is off .</p><p>OK . try it ...<br />notice : mask mast be same.

					<p>I don&#039;t think that a second subnet (192.168.2.x) or a changed netmask 255.255.252.0 is needed.
