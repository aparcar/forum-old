					<p>so from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp6c">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp6c</a> it seems clear how to have the wrt assign a /64 from whatever prefix (/48 or /56, in my case a /56) to each interface on the router.&nbsp; This works well.</p><p>How does one configure the wrt to assign a portion or the remainder of the prefix to the dhcp6s running on the br-lan?&nbsp; In order to assign a smaller prefix to other routers for them to use downstream?&nbsp; From what I can tell from the dhcp6s package, the contents of /etc/dhcp6s.conf remain static, so I am puzzled how I can utilise the remaining addresses from the prefix for re-delegation via dhcp6s :S</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe there is no real dynamic integration between dhcp6c and dhcp6s yet. You&#039;ll probably need to script something unless dhcp6s offers some option to automatically infer the prefix from a given interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>So I took a look at the dhcp6s package and it seems you just have to enable it in /etc/config/dhcp6s, lan is already preselected, the prefix is found automatically.<br />You might need to manually enable IPv6 forwarding on the IPv6 repeating router.</p>									</div>
