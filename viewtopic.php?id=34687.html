					<p>Hi, openwrt newbie here. I was hoping you guys could give me an answer to see if this is the right solution for me.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a wifi router + webserver/php/small db for a project I&#039;m interested in building.</p><p>The usage would be as so... Router would broadcast a wifi network, distribute IP numbers, and allow clients to join network. All requests from clients would be redirected to a page on the webserver that has a form that users could fill out. The form submission would be saved to the DB and clients would be able to see that data through a page on the webserver. (Basically a guestbook, users could sign the guestbook and view entries from previous users) . There&#039;s no connection to the internet, just to the internal webserver.</p><p>Is OpenWRT a good choice for this application? I haven&#039;t chosen hardware yet for this, so that&#039;s still up in the air.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jld</strong> on 12 Feb 2012, 23:10)</p>

					<p>hi, </p><p>all packages are available for your project, so you can run this on openwrt. php, multiple webservers, and database-engines</p><p>the hardware depends on your performance needs. </p><p>there are a lot of devices with an 400MHz Atheros-cpu with 32MB RAM, 4 or 8MB Flash and an USB-Port (for 30-50 Euro)<br />This should be enough to get it up and running. php is quite big so you will need to use extroot to put your rootfs on an usb-stick. <br />the RAM may be a problem so you will not be able to run apache2 and mysql, but a lighttpd and a lightwight db like sqlite or postgresql will work. I tried to run <a href="http://owncloud.org">owncloud</a> on such a devices and you can run it, maybe with a litte swap-partition on the usb-stick. But the performance will be hmm... lets say &quot;not good&quot;. But it will probably work quite well for a few users, and your questbook will also do quite well. </p><p>If you need more power you can get a router with a ~700MHz CPU and 64 or 128MB RAM (70-100 Euro) or you get a device like the sheevaplug. They have a lot of RAM, a quite fast CPU and can run a fully-featured linux-distibution. If you need more power get on of these, (+ a wifi-router for 20 Euro)</p>									</div>
