					<p>Hey there,</p><p>Does anybody know, if there is a script or documentation on how to enable OpenWRT to automatically turn off wifi at a given time, and later on (e.g. in the morning) turn it back on? I&#039;ve searched for a while and couldn&#039;t find anything.</p><p>If there isn&#039;t a real solution yet, I&#039;ll have to start scripting a bit ^^<br />But then I would like to check, if there are still wireless clients connected before I turn off wifi. Does anyone know how to list wireless clients connected to the box?<br />(Ok, reading WiViz sourcecode will definitely provide some answers, but perhaps anybody just knows the commands).</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance! </p><br /><p>swaldester</p>									</div>
