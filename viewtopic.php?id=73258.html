					<p>Hello,</p><p>has someone a source of a (budget) real, <strong>tested</strong> high gain (9-12 dBi) 2.4Ghz Omni Wifi Antenna with RP-SMA connector.<br />Something like this: aliexpress*com/item/Aperit-1-Replacement-9dBi-WiFi-RP-SMA-Antenna-Omni-Directional-for-Asus-Wireless-Routers/32813458110*html (* -&gt; .)</p><p>I have bought several cheap antennas from China. ALL fake. F***ing Chinese.<br />I <span class="bbu">tested</span> them against the 3 dBi antenna that came with the GL.iNet GL-AR150 router.</p><p>[Router] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .300m.obstacle.free. . . . . . . . . . . [Notebook]<br />Both on tables, both on the millimetre same position. Just changing the Antenna on the Router.<br />NONE more than 5 dBi.<br />Anyone ?<br />Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openwrt.n0t</strong> on 14 Feb 2018, 04:54)</p>

					<p>I would say that omni antennas are limited to a gain in the range of 6dBi. In the 12 dBi range, you need to form an unidirectional beam, which you can usually achieve with a flatpatch, yagi, can antenna or a helix.</p>									</div>

					<p>That was mainly a short wrap-up of my knowledge and experience about antenna gain. Anyway, good luck finding the antenna you are looking for.</p>									</div>
