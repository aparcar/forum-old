					<p>I know this doesn&#039;t answer your exact question but I run shorewall and these lines in the rules file would give you what you want:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#

In the above lines my public IP address is 68.188.13.164 and my web server in my DMZ is 172.16.210.2. Hopefully someone else can answer it fully with just iptables commands.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually the OUTPUT line should probably have not made it into this message. I also had a rule for fw2dmz that matched the loc2dmz and net2dmz and I believe it is associated with the fw2dmz. So you can probably ignore it. If you want the rest of my restore script to see all the rules I would be happy to send it to you but I would rather not post it here.</p>									</div>

To correct this, a masquerade is done using the third rule. This has the unfortunate side effect of hiding the original source address, but it does correct the issue with the response. Since this only applies to machines on the lan subnet, I&#039;ve added a -s; this allows proper logging of requests from outside the lan.</p>									</div>

So the MASQ rule is used to hide the original source address, replacing it with the address of the machine doing the redirect.</p><p>If you can force the webserver to send the response to the redirect then you don&#039;t need the MASQ rule and you&#039;ll see the proper source address. This can be done by either iptables commands on the webserver to dnat the respose, or by moving either the client or webserver to another subnet so direct communication between the webserver and client is impossible.</p>									</div>

					<p>An alternative solution is to add your box&#039;s hostname on your lan&#039;s dns server, i.e. /etc/hosts on your router if you haven&#039;t changed the default config. This has the benefits of not making all traffic go through the router (it&#039;s faster) and not hiding your source IP address (it&#039;s more convenient and more secure). Things are a bit more complicated if you have another dns server, like the very nice maradns; you&#039;ll need to declare the hostname (e.g. foo.stereo.lu) as a zone you are authoritative for. I&#039;ll post my maradns config if anyone wants it.</p><p>This is what it looks like here:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wanbox&gt; host foo.stereo.lu
foo.stereo.lu has address 212.121.252.52

					<p>To all:</p><p>Without having the time at the moment to list all the details, just please consider the following:</p><p>If you&#039;re trying to poke a whole through the NAT/firewall to allow for an internal service to be accessed by the public IP address, do you really want that service working properly for the whole known world, EXCEPT for your small corner (on your local LAN, behind the router?)&nbsp; I can see plenty of uses for the opposite, and many uses for making something publicly accessible, but a lot of the approaches people are taking towards this just seems backwards...</p><p>The &quot;_wan&quot; chains are predefined to mean anything that is actually coming from the WAN interface, regardless of address.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing too many people misunderstood the BFD / &quot;Big Fat Disclaimer&quot; in the earlier firewall.user default files (I was one of them), and the &quot;_wan&quot; chains were added to try to make things easier.</p><p>Assume you have a local subnet of 192.168.0.1/24, and a WAN IP of 1.2.3.4.&nbsp; Using the &quot;_wan&quot; chains to forward incoming requests on port 80 to your local web server running on 192.168.0.2 will allow the rest of the outside world to get to your web server.&nbsp; But these rules won&#039;t match any requests to 1.2.3.4 coming from inside the LAN.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to know to use 192.168.0.2 instead, or utilize some of the other &quot;work arounds&quot; such as tweaking your DNS, using a hosts file, etc.</p><p>mbm helped to clarify this in his 2006-01-11 post on this thread.&nbsp; Use the non-&quot;_WAN&quot; chains, and instead of keying to the interface, key to the destination address, e.g. &quot;-d 1.2.3.4&quot;.&nbsp; This will then match any requests for the public IP, whether from the WAN or the LAN interface.&nbsp; The only tricky part is remembering to add the MASQUERADE rule to send the source address that will allow for responses.</p><p>Anyone, please correct me if I&#039;m missing something obvious here.&nbsp; (I&#039;ve been using this approach on many networks for the past year+, without any real issues.)</p><p>quietdragon:<br />I&#039;m confused about which &quot;additional entry&quot; and which &quot;two rules&quot; you are referring to, especially considering the 2 previous quotes and 5 total lines to choose from.</p><p>Given the 3 total quotes, I think that the &quot;mbm wrote&quot; is the best approach.</p><p>With the 3rd quote from the wl500g forum, you need to make sure that &quot;$wan_ip&quot; is initialized somewhere.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not jumped to Kamikaze yet, but as of the latest WR release, this was not defined by default.</p><p>Also, as I understand, by default all forwarded connections are dropped by default, unless accepted at some point with another rule.&nbsp; I would think that the wl500g example is only working if there is another &quot;-j ACCEPT&quot; on the forwarding rule at some point in one of the configuration files.</p><p>My $0.02 for the day...</p>									</div>

I apologise for the lack of clarity in my post. Let me try to rephrase.</p><p>The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration#head-86d5473427fb2c370aa160e1ab14f7a18fb3b308">OpenWRT wiki</a> and /etc/firewall.user give guidance on punching a hole in the firewall to allow an external host to gain access to a service provided by an internal host. For each service, two lines are required:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.2:80
iptables        -A forwarding_wan -p tcp --dport 80 -d 10.0.0.2 -j ACCEPT     ## FWDING RULE #1</code></pre></div><p>The post made by mbm that I was referring to was <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=18736#p18736">this one</a>. In that post, mbm includes this set of rules:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d x.x.x.x -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.2
iptables -A forwarding_rule -p tcp --dport 80 -d 10.0.0.2 -j ACCEPT            ## FWDING RULE #2
iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -s 10.0.0.0/24 -p tcp --dport 80 -d 10.0.0.2 -j MASQUERADE</code></pre></div><p>My question pertains to the difference between FWDING RULE #1 and FWDING RULE #2, and the necessity of FWDING RULE #2 in the presence of FWDING RULE #1.</p><p>FWDING RULE #1 is necessary to allow external hosts access. Internal loopback, at least in my case, appears to work fine in the <em>absence</em> of FWDING RULE #2.</p><p>I would think that mbm has inserted FWDING RULE #2 there for a good reason. My 0.9 White Russian configuration is working without that rule, and I&#039;d like to understand why.</p>									</div>

					<p>Let&#039;s see if I can give a late reply to quietdragon&#039;s question too <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />The difference between the two rules is, as you correctly stated, that they are set on different rulesets. Note the difference between those rulesets though:<br />forwarding_wan applies only to wan -&gt; any traffic.<br />forwarding_rule applies to any -&gt; any traffic.</p><p>I expect the second rule is added so that you can access the webserver from the lan.<br />Normally (stock/simple setup, and probably also your setup) you&#039;d be able to get to the webserver from the rest of the lan anyways, in which case the second rule isn&#039;t needed.<br />I think the posted started with someone having the webserver on a DMZ though, and then the rule might make sense, cause the rest of the lan can&#039;t neccecarily get to the DMZ.</p><p>In most people&#039;s setups, I agree it&#039;s probably not needed though.</p>									</div>
