					<p>Does anyone have experience writing qos scripts which can take advantage of this extra bandwidth? I&#039;d like to run qos on my wan connection, which is at least 6 down 384 up, however, comcast has this thing called powerboost, which is nothing more than a burstable line. I&#039;ve seen speeds as high as 20mbit down, and 2mbit up. I would like to take advantage of this with qos but have no idea where to start.</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately for you to have control you have to be the one in control of the buffers with queues.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are two queues that affect you the upstream and downstream.&nbsp; The downstream queue is located upstream of your cable modem and the upstream queue is either at your modem or also upstream.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>If you want to keep data from queuing on these you must limit the throughput at your router in both directions so data is not queued in either direction upstream of it.&nbsp; QoS on this fluctuating throughput can only be achieved where the packets are queueing.&nbsp; If you want QoS, you will have to impose throughput limits that will be lower than your providers minimum throughput.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Someday, ISPs will wake up to realize that clients want some form of QoS for their traffic, not just the fastest possible downloads.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lschweiss</strong> on 29 Oct 2007, 22:59)</p>

					<p>As I am no where near the Comcast network, I was not aware that it&#039;s burst speed was on a predictable pattern.&nbsp; In which case you are correct, QoS can be managed when it bursts.&nbsp; </p><p>I was under the assumption that it was more random, such as when extra bandwidth in the neighbourhood is available.</p>									</div>
