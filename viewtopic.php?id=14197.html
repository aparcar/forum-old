					<p>I recently bought a WL-500g Premium and installed Kamikaze 7.09 (kernel 2.4). From that point on, web connections via wired and wireless were very slow. Firefox would usually eventually connect, but often the status bar would show &quot;Waiting for google.com&quot; or something similar. When connections were eventually made, transfer speed was normal (bandwidth tests didn&#039;t show any slowdown), but there seemed to be big problems establishing/maintaining connections. I&#039;m pretty sure my configuration was fine as I&#039;ve use White Russian quite a bit and, once I figured out the config file system, all settings were the same and I really didn&#039;t mess with anything outside of configuring IPs, DHCP, DNS, etc.</p><p>I have since reflashed with the latest ASUS firmware and connections are working as they should be. I&#039;m going to try White Russian next as I was previously using that on my WRT54GS with no problems.</p><p>Has anybody seen this type of behavior before? I couldn&#039;t find any reference to similar problems or known issues with Kamikaze.</p><p>I would also appreciate any suggestions on how to troubleshoot the Kamikaze issues. I&#039;m not sure where to even start.</p>									</div>

					<p>i have the excat same router with no issues .. my wan is static , but even if your useing dhcp you could staticly put your ip&#039;s dns in it , may help .. a traceroute from both the router and a connected computer to somthing well knowin ( google.com ) would help to pin down where it&#039;s dieing .. also installing tcpdump will give a good deal of info <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### WAN configuration
