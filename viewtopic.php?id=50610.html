					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a problem with a wds connection. I&#039;ve tried to connect to a native firmware wr941nd with an openwrt wr841nd router with wds client mode. Every time when the client connect to the main router, the main freezed up. But when i&#039;ve tried it with my old wr340g as the main router, everything was working correctly for a few day. I&#039;ve tried it with a wr1043nd too, but that also freezed up.</p><p>I cant find the mistake, i hope somebody met this problem, and successfully solved it.</p><p>Thanks,<br />GÃ¡bor</p>									</div>
