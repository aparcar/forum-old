					<p>Hi [mbm] and anybody else would made OpenWRT already that nice,</p><p>I was just about to create a mobilemesh package (<a href="http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_transfer/mobilemesh/">http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_transfer/mobilemesh/</a>) for b4-pre. However, mobilemesh is c++ and therefore needs gcc++ as well as the libstdc++. Whereas I (a &quot;dump&quot; developer) am able to compile and package mobilemesh, I am, however, not able to compile the gcc++ and libstdc++ .&nbsp; Unfortunately&nbsp; :oops:&nbsp; <br />I tried to compile gcc++ and the libstdc++ by setting &quot;INSTALL_LIBSTDCPP:=true&quot; in the Makefile, but this did not work, since this statement seemed to be ignored by the make process. Anyway..</p><p>Even if I could compile it, I would then probably include the libstdc++ within the mobilemesh-package. Other c++ programs will maybe also provide the libs they need within their specific package.</p><p>I would like to suggest the following:</p><p>The &quot;make&quot; does not only build the openwrt-code.bin and a toolchain for c-programs, but builds a _real_ toolchain with:<br />* gcc++ and libstdc++<br />* ncurses<br />* whatever libs are also needed quite frequently</p><p>The libs in this toolchain (or a buildroot, if you prefer) are then provided in form of packages for the Linksys WRT54G. This way all package maintainers use the same version of a library and do only have to make their specific library make depend on that provided lib.</p><p>Just a suggestion, but I think, such a automatically built&nbsp; environment for package maintainers would certainly speed up the package developement.</p>									</div>

I set INSTALL_LIBSTDCPP <em>after</em> I already compiled the firmware, that&#039;s probably why it did not work.</p><p>nightingale</p>									</div>
