					<p>I hope you will resolve the issue and post your solution here. I have several OpenWRT devices connected directly to my cablemodem box. They all can get up to 15 MBps download speed. However, transferring files from one OpenWRT device to another can only go as high as 4.3 MBps. I don&#039;t know why, but it sure does not look right to me.</p>									</div>

Nothing to worry about, for the class of machines doing duty as routers that is pretty okay. You could try to confirm this by pinging yje ISP-modem from he openwrt-router and vice versa..</p><br /><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
