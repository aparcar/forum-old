					<p>Is is possible to configure my wrt54g to be a wireless client bridged? All the tutorials that I have read are for a routed/NAT client. I need my LAN and my WLAN to be on the same subnet. The end result is a wireless client bridge that will connect to my xbox to be used with system link (uses network broadcasts).</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>It is true that the default install of OpenWRT does have the WLAN and LAN bridged. But it is acting as an Access Point and not a client. I tried to use the default bridge as a client but it didn&#039;t work. I did this by <strong>deleting the firewall rules</strong> and setting the wireless to <strong>sta</strong> mode. I&#039;m sure there are more steps involved but I don&#039;t know linux routing well enough...</p>									</div>

					<p>Google a bit? I wish what you say is true. It is not true that this information is easy to come by. I have found the exact opposite true. I have found countless places where wireless &quot;bridging&quot; is said to be possible. &quot;Your router already comes bridged just make it a client using sta or wet,&quot; is the reply from the masses. WRONG! No one will give me a working configuration, just some theoritical configs. If what you say is true then the OpenWRT WIKI could use your information. Let the secret out of the bag, NO CLIENT BRIDGING.</p><p>Here is another tough question: How can WDS perform client wireless bridging?</p><p>FYI, I searched the whole openwrt forum without a good answer.

					<p>I&#039;m very interested in this configuration. I&#039;m going to test now.

In fact, follwing can be observed: If only one of (PC4, PC5, PC6) gets pinged, all is ok.<br />&nbsp; If multiple of (PC4, PC5, PC6) get pinged, the pings are not done simultaneously! One gets pinged for some seconds, then the next and so on. The package <br />&nbsp; loss is about 70%!<br />- If a Ping from PC1 or PC2 or PC3 is performed to one PC behind the WRT, and i perform a ping using the serial console from the WRT to one of the connected to<br />&nbsp; the DLink router, all other pings get interrupted.<br />&nbsp; <br />Anyone experienced something similar?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got the same problem with experimental (build from march 28), it seems there is an ARP problem somewhere:<br />I&#039;m running a WRT54GS as AP and a WRT54G as a bridge/client, with a PC behind. Pinging both the G and the PC at the same time results in packet loss.</p><p>Another (possibly related) problem is the transmission of multicast traffic (i.e. IPv6 neighbor discovery), which only works from the WET to the AP, but not the other way around.</p>									</div>

					<p>I only work with one machine at the same time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> not that hard, having only one behind the WRT...</p><p>Maybe I&#039;ll switch to pure client mode with proxy arp... but then again, that will be less clean of a solution</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your quick answers! I spent already 3 weekends on this problem, thinking i&#039;m doing something wrong.<br />Only one PC it&#039;s not an option for me. I&#039;ll try to find some information on proxy arp, but i&#039;ve to admit that i know nothing about.</p>									</div>
