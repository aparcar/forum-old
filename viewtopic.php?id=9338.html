					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I have a nice asterisk setup on a WRT54GS which runs quite well but there seems to be a bug<br />in the sending of voicemail by email:</p><p>It uses &quot;mini_sendmail&quot; which has the following sybtax:<br />mini_sendmail [-f&lt;name&gt;] [-t] [-s&lt;server&gt;] [-p&lt;port&gt;] [-T&lt;timeout&gt;] [-v] [address ...]</p><p>The command configure in voicemail.conf is:<br />mailcmd=/usr/sbin/mini_sendmail&nbsp; -fmsg0000.txt -t -s[SMTP Server]</p><p>I found that using the -t param make mini_sendmail to expect to find <br />the From: and To: in the header of the file sent .... BUT<br />Asterisk does not write the From: (email) and To: (email) in the text message file:<br />so it doesn&#039;t work ... </p><p>Also I haven&#039;t any way to tell sendmail the IP of my (ISP&#039;s) SMTP server ... ???<br />other than passing it on the sendmail cmd line with the -s param ???</p><p>I am probably doing something wrong ...&nbsp; as i am a beginner in Linux / Asterisk ... ;-)</p><p>Thank you for any help !</p><p>Noel</p>									</div>
