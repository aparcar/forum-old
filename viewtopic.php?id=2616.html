					<p>Hi,</p><p>Today we released a new candidate for the upcoming OpenWrt 1.0. Please test this release candidate and report any bugs you find. It is very very important, that the bug report is detailed and that you can reproduce the problem. Always backup your data (/etc/, ipkg package list) and do a clean update with mtd:<br />mtd -e linux -r write image.trx linux</p><p>A bug report _must_ contain the exact router model and a description how we can reproduce the problem. Please make no bug reports when you are using rc2 or older releases. Many many bugs are fixed in the new rc3 images. </p><p>If you like to install new software, which is not in white russian, you can use HEAD packages. You can find some binarys here:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/wbx/head/packages">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/wbx/head/packages</a></p><p>Have fun!</p><p> OpenWrt Development Team &lt;openwrt-devel@openwrt.org&gt;</p>									</div>

It would be better to switch from one OpenWrt release to another via<br />mtd. It is very good to delete old stuff. Maybe your TFTP install of the original firmware, does not removed the jffs2 entirely.<br />This means, the new image (rc3), recognise an old unusable jffs2, and pivot_root fails. The system is not accessable.<br />Therefore you always should use mtd -e linux to erase the old crap before writing a new image.</p><p>Have you tried failsafe mode?</p><p>Why your jffs2 images fails? What file you use?<br />There are Motorola models that use 8 MB flash but an erasesize (flash specific value) of 64 kb. This means that you need to use an image with name jffs2-4MB.<br />I think this is your problem. But still all the bug reports are very very bad. We need to know which file you have used.</p><p>I will stop my support, if you did not include every detail, we need to find a solution for your problem.</p>									</div>
