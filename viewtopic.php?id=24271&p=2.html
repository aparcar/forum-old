Which as i mentioned in my previous post: &quot;creates a couple of char devices that we can use to dump the atm processor and adsl registers&quot;.<br/>[4] We load the adsl drivers when we are ready.<br/>[5] We use the usual web based or command line configuration interface to change settings,<br/>[6] We use the char devices to dump the registers as a connection is attempted/made/in progress. Maybe we could make the char device update every time a change is made to the registers. Or on a timer?<br/>[7] We compare changes, different vpi/vci, connection state, etc with the dumps of the registers.</p><p>I dont do C, im still learning. I do understand the hardware and physical connections on electronic devices, so i can understand asembly, memory and registers but C is just too much. I have quite a few broadcom based routers. I know the score with linux, bricking, jtag, etc. So im well up for frying a few routers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe I understand something wrong, but I think ATM is protocol (data link layer services that run over OSI Layer 1 physical links).<br/>Also, as I know there are open source ATM drivers for linux.<br/>And &quot;ATM processor&quot; and &quot;ATM&#039; are not the same things.</p><p>You are saying about ATM processor and ADSL processor registers.<br/>But how you now that there are registers? Maybe they has some kind of io ports, DMA access, etc.<br/>If you are saying about the list and names of registers, than you know the specification of hardware.<br/>So if you know detailed specification of hardware, we need nothing else. Just write code.</p><p>We can&#039;t&nbsp; dump registers, because we do not know how to access them, how many registers and so on.<br/>If we will be able to read registers, then sure we can use described steps.</p><p>PDF doc in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric … riber_Line</a> describes &quot;ATM protocol&quot; but not any device driver.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can&#039;t get the full spec or datasheets without paying large sums of cash to broadcom.

					<p>That&#039;s looks good to rewrite DSL from the scratch, but as for me, this work can take a long time to make job done. And can happen on the finish we will have DSL driver for discontinued chipsets. Why not adopt existing supported kernel for openwrt build tree? Take a brief look to the neufbox Openwrt fork <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=107660">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=107660</a> IMHO, it can be a good start point to have working Openwrt on our ADSL roters.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sure, birth is much more important thing.<br/>Wish you and you girlfriend easy and happy birth.</p><p>I understand your point of view.</p><p>But seems that you do not understand the volume of work.<br/>For my rough evaluation it may take a lot of time. Think near a half of year.<br/>Write (1 day) - test (1 day) - inform you (1 day) - write ...<br/>Heave some experience in remote work. So think this project may take a lot of time.<br/>So as for me I do not want to hurry to start this work. So I was thinking about what to do next.<br/>Also here were holidays.</p><p>That is why I was thinking that adopt the existing code (&quot;clean room&quot;) is much faster and much quality approach.<br/>There is not many desire persons to develop. Maybe it is explained by flowing. Person who wants to use ADSL in OpenWRT just takes this sources and rebuilds OpenWRT with them. For home use (in not USA or other developed country) there is no big reason if the router clean licensed or not.</p><p>If you do not mind, I may start some simple work. As I understand, for first step you need the driver to dump registers of device.<br/>Think it is simple and will not take much time. I may use native SDK from D-Link and create char device or TCP port to dump values.<br/>Have some time now, so will do this exercise.</p>									</div>

					<p>Broadcom Joins the Linux Foundation</p><p>It was exciting news back in September when Broadcom unveiled brcm80211, the fully open and Linux-compatible driver for several of its 802.11n wireless chipsets. Now, however, it looks like the company will soon make what promises to be an even bigger announcement.</p><p>Similar Articles:</p><p>Linux Kernel Update Brings a New Wave of Hardware Support.<br/>Linux Wi-Fi Gets Easier with New Broadcom Driver.<br/>Linux and Windows 8&#039;s Secure Boot: What We Know So Far.<br/>Ubuntu 11.04 &#039;Natty Narwhal&#039;: A First Look at the OS.<br/>Linux Mint 11 and Fedora 15: In One Week, Two Gems Debut.<br/>Linux Foundation: Secure Boot Need Not Be a Problem.<br/>Specifically, in a move that will be officially announced on Monday, the company has taken its Linux support to the next level by joining the Linux Foundation, with plans to extend its open development and collaboration with the Linux community.</p><p>Broadcom will continue to work on the Linux Driver Project, and it will also participate in The Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit, enabling it to work directly with community developers as well as other industry players and suppliers.</p><p>&quot;There is no question: Linux has become a major platform for communications devices and technologies,&quot; said Michael Hurlston, senior vice president and general manager for Broadcom&#039;s WLAN line of business. &quot;Our decision to open source the drivers for Broadcom&#039;s 802.11 chipsets is in response to our growing base of customers using Linux and is the first of what we expect to be many open development success stories.&quot;</p><p>Problem Solved</p><p>Historically, wireless networking has been a sticking point for some Linux users, including those with netbooks and laptops incorporating Broadcom chipsets, which typically have used proprietary drivers that don&#039;t work with the free and open source operating system.</p><p>Competing vendors such as Atheros and Intel began supporting Linux natively sooner than Broadcom did, so the company&#039;s move last fall was met with resounding applause.</p><p>Since the release of that new open driver, it has been integrated into the recent Linux kernel release 2.6.37, where it can be actively improved upon by the entire Linux community. It was also included in Ubuntu 10.10, or Maverick Meerkat, last fall.</p><p>Moving forward, Linux users of hardware with Broadcom chips will no longer have to give wireless another thought.</p><p>A Rapidly Growing Roster</p><p>Now, by joining the Linux Foundation, Broadcom is clearly signaling its intent to continue such efforts in the long term--a particularly exciting prospect given its portfolio of semiconductors for wired and wireless communications.</p><p>The addition of Broadcom, in fact, is one of many important additions to the Linux Foundation in recent months. Perhaps most notably, China Mobile joined the group in November, followed by Huawei and Mentor Graphics in December, for example.</p><p>IP management company Protecode and Timesys both joined this week, and Cybercom and GoAhead will join Broadcom in announcing their own membership next week.</p><p>As I noted back in September, it&#039;s all a testament to the growing power of Linux as a market force. Businesses are turning to it in increasing numbers, and so are individuals. It&#039;s great to see companies like Broadcom recognize that this is a significant market that can no longer be ignored.</p>									</div>
