					<p>I deleted my post from yesterday because it might sound more complicated than what I am looking for.</p><p>I have searched google and these forums looking for others experiences in using the TL-WR703N for network monitor. I see many mentions of bandwidthd and other but it is not clear enough to me and need experts input please.</p><p>Can TL-WR703N be connected to a Ethernet hub (non switched) between my router and my home so that I could monitor all in/out going traffic and even know how much bandwidth my wife and kids (and others who are living with us) everyone is using?</p><p>Maybe I could see mac addresses and total amount of bandwidth everyone together is using or even individually?</p><p>Most solutions I find are using a passthrough method but this router would not allow this having only one Ethernet port but love the idea of using it and learning about openwrt if I could get some input.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello DAC_2020,</p><p>I tried something very similar - check my post at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54048">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54048</a><br />Will not help on the bandwidth logging, but give transparency on the Internet addresses being contacted.</p><p>Keep in mind that most WLAN router do NAT - so if you monitor traffic to your router you will only see the router IP, not the devices behind it. And small routers do not offer port-mirroring to capture all traffic.</p><p>Am curious to see how others progress...</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh yes, I saw your post while searching. <br />I am not going to use the device in WLAN mode, only connected into a hub using Ethernet. The hub would be connected to my house network and to my router so that the device could sniff everything without having to get int port mirroring etc. </p><p>Since it is not in-line, then it cannot really know all that much other than sniffing which will not give bandwidth and other good things. </p><p>I did come across another tp-link router that looks interesting and seems to run some openwrt, the TL-R402M. There are other models which seem to be supported. It is a switch/router which might be a good solution if openwrt runs on it right.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dac_2020</strong> on 23 Nov 2014, 22:56)</p>
