					<p>Hi,</p><p>Is there a program for OpenWRT (or at least for Linux which could be portet to OpenWRT) that emulates a NAS for using 802.1x on the switch ports?</p><p>This could make a cheap 55â‚¬ OpenWRT into a 4-Port managed-switch with enterprise 802.1x port security; exactly that I would look for.</p><p>lg,<br />dy/dx</p><p>PS: If I want to connect an OpenWRT to a Managed-Switch requiring 802.1x authorisation...could this be acquired using XSupplicant? In this case, an OpenWRT can also be used for cascading 802.1x lines: The WAN port is connected to a 802.1x secured line and authenticated with XSupplicant. Then, the LAN ports could provide 802.1x secured ports itselves.</p>									</div>
