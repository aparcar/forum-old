					<p>This post describes how to install an OpenWrt kernel and rootfs on the internal NAND flash of the <a href="http://www.plugapps.com/index.php5?title=Hardware:_Seagate_DockStar">Seagate Dockstar</a> so that it will boot into OpenWrt at power-on, with no USB storage device required.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#039;ve consolidated this HOWTO and the following one into <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ecc/dockstar-howto.html">a single guide to installing OpenWrt on the Dockstar.</a></p><p><strong>WARNING: this approach requires you to open the case and install a serial cable, and completely replaces the factory-installed software with OpenWrt. No one has tried to restore the factory firmware yet, so we don&#039;t know whether that&#039;s possible. Proceed at your own risk.</strong></p><p>1. Open the case and install a serial cable. See <a href="http://ahsoftware.de/dockstar/#ubootpatches">this page for the serial pinout (and how to open the case)</a> and <a href="http://www.plugapps.com/index.php5?title=File:Connecting_DockStar_Serial.jpg">this page for a picture of where to find the connector.</a></p><p>2. You need to build your own OpenWrt kernel and root filesystem image, because the Marvell Kirkwood target currently supports only the Sheevaplug, which has a different NAND flash layout.</p><p>Use &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to configure the build system for a kirkwood target. Add squashfs in the target images section. Also select built-in luci and ntpclient packages. </p><p>(This step isn&#039;t required, but I recommend it for easier recovery from bad flash writes below.) Use &quot;make kernel_menuconfig&quot; to add built-in SCSI disk, USB EHCI, USB storage, and ext2 filesystem support.</p><p>Do an initial build.</p><p>3.

If you didn&#039;t do the &quot;recommended&quot; part of step 2 (enabling support for USB storage and ext2 in the kernel), do it now. Rebuild the kernel and re-flash it.</p><p>2. Format a USB drive with one partition containing an ext2 filesystem. As root, un-tar the contents of bin/kirkwood/openwrt-kirkwood-rootfs.tar.gz onto the USB drive, and also copy the openwrt-kirkwood-rootfs.squashfs image onto the drive (as a regular file).</p><p>3. In u-boot, do<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CE&gt;&gt; setenv bootargs_root root=/dev/sda1 rootdelay=10 rootfstype=ext2
CE&gt;&gt; boot</code></pre></div><p>Your Dockstar should boot with the USB drive as its root filesystem.</p><p>4. Configure OpenWrt so that it can network to the outside world. Then do:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># opkg update
# opkg install mtd-utils</code></pre></div><p>(Alternatively, you can copy the mtd-utils package, or its commands, onto the USB drive before booting the Dockstar.)</p><p>5. Use the mtd-utils commands to flash the mtd2 partition:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># flash_eraseall /dev/mtd2
# nandwrite /dev/mtd2 /openwrt-kirkwood-rootfs.squashfs</code></pre></div><p>6. Type &quot;reboot&quot; and hope that your rootfs partition is now correct.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ecc</strong> on 10 Jul 2010, 03:20)</p>
