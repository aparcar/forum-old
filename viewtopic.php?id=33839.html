					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I have a setup where I have 2 sites. The &quot;SERVER-site&quot; is connected to internet (DSL). The &quot;CLIENT-site&quot; is connected with a wireless bridge to the &quot;SERVER-site&quot; using Zyxel hardware. The bandwith between the sites is 15Mbit/s net.<br />Unfortunately wireless is not known to be very stable. Therefore I have set up a bridge (tap0) on OpenWRT 10.03.1 with 3G UMTS USB stick on Netgear WNDR 3700v2. <br />That all works well. (Ok, bandwith is just 50% if the 3G link is used, but that is acceptable.)</p><p>The question is how do I manage to automatically fail over to UMTS link in case wireless goes down? </p><p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for the answer(s)</p><p>basically I have seen that before, but it will not help me as both path I form a bridge into the same place. So the arp tables should be identical in any case. Furthermore it is a bit complicated to ifup the 3G interface and get connected to Internet as that requires a manual step of accepting a web page. You get redirected to that https webpage every 1st time you open a 3G connection and you have to klick the accept button to get real internet connection. (that is another struggle I have to fight against later) For the moment I was about to start the 3G connection once in the morning and leave it connected all day long to overcome that accept-issue.</p><p>I am wondering of there is no more smart solution than shutting down the interface. If the networks would be different I would use bgp, but as the nature of a bridge is that it all is the same network...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>briearn</strong> on 2 Jan 2012, 18:49)</p>

					<p>You could automate the login phase with a curl request triggered from /etc/hotplug.d/iface/, just an idea.</p>									</div>
