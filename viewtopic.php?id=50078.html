					<p>Hi, I did a wrong configuration in SSH mode&nbsp; and now I cannot access to the router(TP link WR 841 n), it&#039;s not pingable neither on the default 192.168.1.1 in failsafe mode but the led works all well so the failsafe is on. Any solution to avoid serial connection?</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you made sure that your PC&#039;s ip address is correctly 192.168.1.x (2-253), when trying the failsafe mode?<br />(many PCs go into link-local 169.254.x.x when dhcp fails, and that does not then work with failsafe mode)</p><p>And what do you mean by &quot;led works all well&quot;? It blinks normally? Goes into failsafe mode&#039;s rapid blinking?</p>									</div>
