Will they be reinstalled or are they gone?</p></blockquote></div><p>All of your settings will come over in the sysupgrade, but will still need to re-add any ipks or other packages that have been installed by you.&nbsp; </p><p>I would recommend backing up anything custom like scripts, and then move them back over after the upgrade. If this is your first sysupgrade, you can do the upgrade, but always go back to the other partition if something didn&#039;t come over. From there just download what didn&#039;t get copied and then boot to the other partition and upload it back into place. Just take note, and then the next sysupgrade will go smoother.</p>									</div>

					<p>The sysupgrade worked I guess. But what about the wifi driver, is the one in the 5422 build ( 4.9.65+10.3.4.0-20170810-1 ) working properly for the wrt1200ac? I actually was curious about the latency issues, and noticed, I have those too I guess, but just for devices which use 80mhz on the 5ghz band. I have a &lt;1ms ping on my laptop which uses 40mhz 5ghz, but 2-3ms and random ping jumps to 40-60ms or even package loss on a tablet of mine which uses 80mhz 5ghz, when I download or have for example a video stream opened next to the ping. So I guess the 5422 wifi driver hasnt this option disabled?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 7 Dec 2017, 06:52)</p>

					<p><strong>richjeanes</strong>, I have no issues with PPTPd running on all David&#039;s builds ever.<br />I am not iptables guru, but here is what I&#039;ve add into firewall config:<br />1) added &quot;virtual&quot; or &quot;dummy&quot; interface named PPTP_VPN with Ethernet Adapter: &quot;ppp+&quot;<br />Note plus &quot;+&quot; here. It&#039;s a interface mask, so several connections will match this interface simultaneously.<br />2) Since I need my pptp clinets able to connect to internal network and to internet in same time, I&#039;ve add new firewall zone called same PPTP_VPN (Covered networks is PPTP_VPN only, thus any pppX interface), where all input\output\forward by default is accepted, forwarding to wan and lan accepted also, and forwarding from source zone lan also accepted.<br />3) FW traffic rule : Any tcp, From any host in wan, To any router IP at port 1723 on this device<br />that will allow incoming request to TCP port 1723 (pptpd port)<br />4) FW traffic rule: Any gre, From any host in wan, To any router IP on this device<br />that rule allow incoming Protocol 47 (GRE).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AddRemover</strong> on 7 Dec 2017, 09:09)</p>

					<p>AddRemover, I&#039;m not trying to run a PPTP server (I&#039;d use OpenVPN if I wanted to run a VPN). I&#039;m trying to connect to an outside PPTP VPN from a client on my network.

					<p>I&#039;m still confused I am back to running the stock LEDE firmware (not David&#039;s), and although I do see the CESA reference:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@route:~# dmesg|grep -i cesa

					<p>@agelwarg, The assumption regarding the comparison was that you were starting with an image that included <em>cryptodev</em>. Since LEDE 17.01.4 does not have the module, you probably should expect the removal to fail.</p>									</div>
