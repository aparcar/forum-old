					<p>My internet provider at my dorm room uses Securew2 over a wired connection. This works just fine when I just want to connect my laptop, but I would really like to get this connection wireless in order for use for other devices as well (PS3 etc.). I have searched much throughout the web and I found out that installing OpenWrt on my ASUS WL-500g should help me to get a working connection through my router. I finally managed to install the Kamikaze firmware onto the router, but where do I go from here? I don&#039;t consider myself an experienced linux user, so any help on how I could set this connection up to the wan port would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
