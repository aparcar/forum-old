					<p>So, I&#039;ve invested a fair amount of hardware into a platform and peripherals that hopefully meet the goals I had in mind for the optimal router.</p><p>I&#039;ve started a github project for the setup and configurations-- I&#039;m asking for help, make it easy for people to help, right? I will happily convert forum suggestions to repo updates for anyone not familiar with git.</p><p>It all started with a post on reddit about the best router I could get for $200-- what if you didn&#039;t have the constraints that many routers on the market do? Turns out it costs almost double to crazy go nuts. Be that as it may-- let&#039;s pimp this thing out in a software kind of way. I&#039;m already trying to make this as public as I can so anyone else with a lapse of good judgement can follow along.</p><p>Well, thanks for looking. I hope there are other people curious to see what it can do.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/bradchesney79/2015BeastRouterProject">https://github.com/bradchesney79/2015BeastRouterProject</a></p>									</div>
