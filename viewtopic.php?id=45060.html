					<p>Hi all, </p><p>Yesterday my <a href="http://8devices.com/carambola-2">Carambola 2</a> + dev board arrived in the mail. I found the wiki on the official 8Devices website lacky, mostly centered on the first revision; the slightly bigger Carambola (1).</p><p>I&#039;ll post a brief &#039;getting started&#039; for now and will try to keep this thread updated with relevant tips, tricks and guides.</p><p>So, this is the device: </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32206505/carambola2.png" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32206505/carambola2.png" /></span></p><p>Ltr: Mini-usb with FTDI chip, USB-host port, 2x buttons, Carambola2 chip, 2x nif, 2x rj45 port. </p><p>According to various sources connecting should be as easy as telnet to 192.168.1.1 to one of the lan ports, but sadly, no go.</p><p>Thanks to the usb fdti connecting to serial terminal is very easy, in linux use this command to connect:</p><p>picocom -f n -p n -b 115200 -i -r -l /dev/ttyUSB0</p><p>This stumped me at first, I just got &#039;console ready&#039; and that was it, after pressing enter I got into the boards command shell.</p><p>Entering help gave me a list of options, one of them gave me a list of images on flash. I found OpenWRT barrier breaker was on there somewhere.</p><p>Not knowing what to do I tried some other useless commands, when I asked for the memory map it responded &quot;why the fuck would you want the memory map?&quot; -- nice.</p><p>As it turned out I just had to type &#039;boot&#039; (without quotes) and off it went! After a couple of seconds I was prompted with the OpenWRT logo and logged in as root.</p><p>Next I set the root password with &#039;passwd&#039; and found that LuCi was allready installed..</p><p>More to come.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Guzz</strong> on 2 Jul 2013, 11:56)</p>

					<p>If the OEM already flashed OpenWrt to it, I don&#039;t see why on earth THEY (8Devices) cannot offer their patches for OpenWrt and be done with it.</p>									</div>
