					<p>Hi! <br />I have started playing with the buildroot and it seems quite a nice thing.<br />It is so nice that I just can&#039;t believe it. I have a wrt850g motorola router - and in the config I can select the Kamikaze branch. Everything went smooth with building. I must say it is &quot;fast&quot; (comparable to i.e. gentoo building of familiar linux building) and&nbsp; doesn&#039;t require a lot of space. <br />Just tell me - is it safe to flash my router with the kamikaze image . Of course I don&#039;t ask what is going to happen if I made a wrong config but generally - is 2.6 branch stable enough ? It probably is for the linksys devices but I haven&#039;t heard of anybody trying it with motorola....<br />Thanks </p><p>Yans</p>									</div>

					<p>I also played around with kamikaze on a wr850G v1, but with 2.4 kernel.<br />Things I noticed:<br />- no webif (not ported yet)<br />- nvram vars were not read(-&gt; router ip = 192.168.1.1 despite any entry in nvram)<br />If you try to get something stable I wouldnÂ´t go for the development branch:-)</p><p>Berni</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt no longer uses nvram; if you want to change your ip, change it in /etc/config/network.</p><p>Buildroot-ng should be quite stable, it just isn&#039;t documented yet and is missing several key features.</p>									</div>
