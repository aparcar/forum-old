					<p>I&#039;m working on a custom build of OpenWRT for the RL-750GL and the RL-750UL (UL has PoE and a USB port) based off trunk. </p><p>The process of getting OpenWRT on this device is currently as follows:</p><p>* Compile initramfs and .tar.gz<br />* Use reset button on device to boot via TFTP into the initramfs image<br />* Telnet/SSH into device<br />* Mount the kernel partition and copy the new kernel to it<br />* Mount the rootfs partition, remove files, extract tar.gz over it<br />* Reboot the device (it successfully boots)</p><p>This leaves me with root (/) on a yaffs partition and it seems to be rather hard to cleanly deploy new builds.</p><p>Instead of untaring to rootfs, I&#039;ve briefly tried flashing the jffs and squashfs images onto the flash, but they don&#039;t seem to do anything (the system mounts with the older filesystem and no changes).</p><p>How hard should it be to get JFFS (perhaps with SquashFS) on the flash storage?&nbsp; Does it take more than just enabling the target in the menuconfig? Is there a specific command I should be using to get one of the files to persist on the mtd? Does it matter that /proc/filesystems doesn&#039;t show jffs2?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /proc/mtd
