					<p>Hello, several days ago i have downgrade my nsm2 <br />(6.0.6 to 5.6 to 5.5 to chaos) and it works perfect as repeater for my wifi.<br />So i&#039;m just tryin to wardrive some other wifis with this. And it work for 1 or 2 hours, and than i have noticed that i cant create mon0&nbsp; with airmon-ng start wlan0. It shows error. Btw ater reset i needed to airmon-ng start wlan0 every time... And that i try to reset router... and i can&#039;t go to 192.168.1.1 wia any protocols (ssh, telnet... nothing works). Led light of lan blinking on start, but after some time it just light...<br />So tell me the truth - can i repair with ttl serial cable? Look like it&#039;s the only way, because i cant get even in failsave mode! It&#039;s so terrible, i do my best with all insructions, why it bricks i can&#039;t undestand...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>felixanti</strong> on 17 Sep 2017, 23:02)</p>
