					<p>Well, due to a lot of common questions, I must say that this firmware does NOT contain any web interface by default. <br />In order to install it you&#039;ll have to telnet to the router on 192.168.1.1, make sure you got internet connection (For ADSL / PPtP you can set the dialup manually) or if you got MPLS connection with the cable company, it will just pull DHCP. </p><p>In order to install luci web interface, after you got an internet connection, you should just run from the telnet session</p><p># opkg update<br /># opkg install luci<br /># /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br /># /etc/init.d/uhttpd start</p><p>Another note is, that USB is currently not available due to lack of the usb modules for this kernel. <br />Hope it clarifies some things. <br />Again, feel free to ask if you got any questions.</p>									</div>

					<p>As we found out[1] today, you can switch from this firmware to any other openwrt (AA or trunk) via direct mtd write.</p><p><strong>Warning!</strong><br />This commands are potentially harmful and you might brick your device if you&#039;ll try to write broken firmware image!<br />Checking md5 checksums might be useful before flashing.</p><p>I.e. flashing newer trunk:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># wget -O /tmp/firmware.bin http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4300-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin
# mtd -r write /tmp/firmware.bin firmware</code></pre></div><p>After successful flash via mtd you will be able to use common sysupgrade to upgrade firmware, as your device will be unlocked. However if you actually live in Israel remember your regional restriction on 5GHz channels and txpower that you&#039;ll need to set up yourself to conform your local laws.</p><p>[1] <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi?id=14:56970-167#4660">http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi?id=14:56970-167#4660</a> (discussion in russian)</p>									</div>

					<p>mtd won&#039;t check, if the file you flash to your routers partition is valid for it or not. so you can go over openwrt to a different firmware. TP-Link sometimes provides firmware images including the bootloader, in that case you need to cut off the bootloader.<br />There is information about getting back to stock firmware in the wiki of several TP-Link devices - they are all somehow similar. Also keep in mind to not violate your countries regulations.</p>									</div>
