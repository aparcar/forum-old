					<p>Several times I already asked and never got a solution. We anded up on agreening that something is broken but not on my side. Quick recap on what is happening.</p><p>I am useing transmission-daemon and for some reason no matter what I&#039;ve done transmission-daemon always saying that port I am using is closed. </p><p>After checking with canyouseeme and other sites to check if port is ACTUALLY open it&#039;s saying it is open. But transmission still saying that it&#039;s closed.</p><p>Back in a day when I was using DDWRT I had ideantical issue but by using this easy code I could open port:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport PORT_NUMBER -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>Again in both cases canyouseeme showed port is opened and only code actually made it open on router/transmission side</p><p>But now with OpenWRT it&#039;s no longer working and for some time not I don&#039;t know what to do. Last answer I&#039;ve got it port checker is NOT working on transmission. Well guess what I installed&nbsp; ubuntu with transmission-daemon and it&#039;s working just fine. So what&#039;s up ?</p><p>Can anyone help please because I feel code I am using it&#039;s good for DDWRT but not for openwrt and it&#039;s not port opening or anything like that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xakep</strong> on 7 May 2017, 07:54)</p>
