					<p>Hello,<br />I am running an openwrt tp-link wdr4300, interested in running a VM using vmware workstation and creating a situation where my vm has access to the WAN, but not to my LAN (at 192.168.1.1).</p><p>I pictured it something like creating a separate dhcp pool at a different subnet for the virtual machines. </p><p>Is my goal achievable in your eyes or should I be looking at a different solution such as host only network?</p>									</div>

					<p>I do not understand, perhaps I was not clear about the setup.<br />The VM is running on a host machine that is in the LAN i&#039;m trying to block the guest from. therefore as far as I know, VLAN is not a possibility.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was thinking about tagging a VLAN on the LAN port to be used by the guest. I read in the pfsense documentation that they recommends against using tagged VLAN on an interface you use untagged because of inconsistent result on some network cards. It works for me anyway and it&#039;s worth a try if you can&#039;t tag the LAN for the VM host.</p><p>On the VM host you need to associate the tagged VLAN with an network interface/card on the guest. I can&#039;t help you a lot there since I don&#039;t use vmware myself.</p>									</div>
