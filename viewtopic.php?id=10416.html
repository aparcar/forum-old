					<p>I don&#039;t understand <strong>where</strong> you expect your echo to go.&nbsp; If you run your script from the terminal it goes to /fd/1 which is linked to a pts (look at /proc/$$/fd/1), it is what you call <strong>your screen</strong></p><p>But when your script is run by /sbin/hotplug you have no pts,&nbsp; and I don&#039;t understand on which screen you expect the output to go? On a desktop you allocate tty in initd and an old habit <em>no longer in use</em> was to redirect kernel messages to an unused tty. But your wl-hdd has not this big attached console, so the only place is syslog (that you can send to a memory buffer, a file, a tcp or udp socket).</p><p>Your script inherit its output from /sbin/hotplug, that probably inherit it from init. (I&#039;m not sure, hotplug has changed since kernel 2.6 and is now triggered by udev, I don&#039;t remenber exactly the kernel 2.4 way) of course you can change /sbin/hotplug to log the standard output and error of the scripts or to redirect it to a file, or socket.</p><p>But it is simpler to write directly to syslog, with logger.</p>									</div>
