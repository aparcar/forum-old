					<p>hi i have a dir-300/ar430w </p><p>im having a bit of trouble trying to find the right firmware to<br />put on it. i was looking for mmc flash support for my router and the only firmware i could<br />find that supports it was open-wrt. so do i have to customize my own firmware and packages <br />or is their a pre made one some where?</p><p>also many installation guides talk about a file called vmlinux.bin.l7 but<br />in the download folder for atheros based routers their is no such file?</p><p>thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>project-nz</strong> on 30 May 2009, 13:35)</p>

					<p>To have fully functional firmware for DIR-300 you have to compile trunk yourself, as the 8.09 release lacks support for the switch chip used in this router. I don&#039;t know if the trunk is fully functional at this time, a month ago it didn&#039;t work for me. My solution was to compile 8.09 release with the patches for IC-175 switch, as described in the Wiki. Works good since then, notably better than stock firmware. I have one advice though - don&#039;t use LuCI on an active duty router, it&#039;s too heavy both on memory and CPU time. Use it for initial setup only. Otherwise response time will be very slow and the roter will reboot sooner or later. Instead, install mc (Midnight Commander) and use it to edit configuration files directly. I even think it should be included in the pre-built images, because FS navigation and text editing is MUCH handier than using ash command line and vi editor.</p>									</div>
