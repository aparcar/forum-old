					<p>hi,</p><p>just some more notes...</p><p>It would be really cool if you update your routers and test these images. Many bugs from rc1 are fixed.<br />WDS should work again. pppoe and pptp is now started via ifup.pppoe and ifup.pptp. Please add problem description and patches to this thread.</p><p>And all problems with the old v1.1 routers are fixed! thx nbd!</p><p>We will not any new features to white russian, so do not ask about. (feature freeze)</p><p>Developers of new packages should use cvs HEAD and provide patches for it.</p><br /><p>good luck<br />wbx</p>									</div>

					<p>just some silly questions. <br />Are there big differences between today cvs head and white russian rc2?<br />I&#039;m actualy using a RC1 jffs version.<br />If I flash a new version, what will be updated? is the root jffs filesystem erased?<br />If I backup my old install, what do I need to upgrade, only the kernel modules?</p><p>Thanks for your great work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Some advice: Ignore the unset nvram variables like wl0_hwaddr.

					<p>Re: Motorola WR850G</p><p>I went through quite a hair pulling trying to get everything sorted out on the WR850G last month with RC1.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the steps for debricking or updating or even reversing to the original Motorola firmware (yes, yes, I know -- it should go into the wiki.&nbsp; When I have time, when I have time).&nbsp; BTW, all my experimenting is done from Windows, so the intructions are Windows-centric:</p><br /><p><strong>!!Notes before flashing anything!!</strong></p><p>The Motorola WR850G defaults to 192.168.10.1 on its LAN IP at boot, <strong>EVEN IF &quot;lan_ipaddr&quot; IS SET TO SOMETHING ELSE!</strong>&nbsp; All your TFTP&#039;ing will have to be done from a 192.168.10.x address.</p><br /><p><strong><em>Updating a virgin WR850G:</em></strong></p><p>1. Follow the instructions in the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing#head-16e8d1f9495b84660425ea230a05e0305b71bdd1">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins … 305b71bdd1</a></p><br /><p><strong><em>Reverting an RC1 or RC2 WR850G to the original Motorola firmware:</em></strong></p><p>1. Open up a hex editor and load in the Motorola firmware (I use HHD).<br />2. Delete the first eight bytes (everything before &quot;HDR0&quot;) and save.<br />3. Make sure your &quot;boot_wait&quot; NVRAM value is set to &quot;on&quot; and saved (I use &quot;Putty&quot; for telneting/ssh).<br />4. Set your local machine&#039;s IP address to 192.168.10.5 (or anything between 192.168.10.2 and 192.168.10.254) and mask to 255.255.255.0.<br />5. Open up a console window and change to the directory the Motorola firmware is in.<br />6. Type in: &quot;TFTP -i 192.168.10.1 PUT filename.bin&quot; where &quot;filename.bin&quot; is your Motorola firmware.&nbsp; <strong>DON&#039;T HIT ENTER JUST YET!</strong><br />7. Unplug your WR850G, plug it back in and wait a second.<br />8. Now hit Enter in your console window.<br />9. Your TFTP transfer should finish in a few seconds.&nbsp; <strong>WAIT AT LEAST 60 SECONDS FOR THE FLASH TO PROGRAM!</strong><br />10. Unplug your WR850G and plug it back in.&nbsp; You now will have the old firmware.<br />11. Reset your local machine&#039;s IP address and mask back to where it was (DHCP on my machine).</p><br /><p><strong><em>Updating an RC1 WR850G to RC2:</em></strong></p><p>1. Download &quot;openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&quot; (<span class="bbu">NOT</span> &quot;openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin&quot;!!).<br />2. Make sure your &quot;boot_wait&quot; NVRAM value is set to &quot;on&quot; and saved (I use &quot;Putty&quot; for telneting/ssh).<br />3. Set your local machine&#039;s IP address to 192.168.10.5 (or anything between 192.168.10.2 and 192.168.10.254) and mask to 255.255.255.0.<br />4. Open up a console window and change to the directory the RC2 firmware is in.<br />5. Type in: &quot;TFTP -i 192.168.10.1 PUT openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&quot;.&nbsp; <strong>DON&#039;T HIT ENTER JUST YET!</strong><br />6. Unplug your WR850G, plug it back in and wait a second.<br />7. Now hit Enter in your console window.<br />8. Your TFTP transfer should finish in a few seconds.&nbsp; <strong>WAIT AT LEAST 60 SECONDS FOR THE FLASH TO PROGRAM!</strong><br />9. Unplug your WR850G and plug it back in.&nbsp; You now will have the RC2 firmware.<br />10. Reset your local machine&#039;s IP address and mask back to where it was (DHCP on my machine).</p><br /><p><strong><em>Debricking a WR850G that has &quot;boot_wait&quot; set to &quot;on&quot;:</em></strong></p><p>1. Follow either one of the two intructions above.</p><br /><p><strong><em>Debricking a WR850G that did <span class="bbu">NOT</span> have &quot;boot_wait&quot; set to &quot;on&quot;:</em></strong></p><p>1. Unplug the Wr850G and open it up -- unscrew the one torx screw in the back (you can use a hex key driver if that&#039;s handy), then pop open the cover.&nbsp; You will have to CAREFULLY pry the top off with quite a bit of force.&nbsp; Use your fingers.&nbsp; If it feels like you&#039;re about to break it, don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s pretty tough -- just try to not bend the top, which will stress crack the plastic.<br />2. Locate the flash chip (right next to the internal antenna).&nbsp; On mine it&#039;s an Intel TE28F320.&nbsp; All the V3 WR850G&#039;s have this.&nbsp; If it&#039;s an older V2 or V1, it might have an AMD chip.<br />3. Set your local machine&#039;s IP address to 192.168.10.5 (or anything between 192.168.10.2 and 192.168.10.254) and mask to 255.255.255.0.<br />4. Open up a console window and change to the directory the firmware is in.<br />5. Type in: &quot;TFTP -i 192.168.10.1 PUT filename.bin&quot; where &quot;filename.bin&quot; is the firmware.&nbsp; <strong>DON&#039;T HIT ENTER JUST YET!</strong><br />6. Get a sewing needle or pin.&nbsp; Count down on the LEFT side (lettering on the chip should be upright) to lead 15.&nbsp; CAREFULLY insert the sewing needle between leads 15 and 16* -- it should NOT require any force.<br />7. Now plug in your WR850G while holding the needle in place.<br />8. Wait two to three seconds, then remove the needle.<br />9. Now hit Enter in your console window.<br />10. Your TFTP transfer should finish in a few seconds.&nbsp; <strong>WAIT AT LEAST 60 SECONDS FOR THE FLASH TO PROGRAM!</strong><br />11. Unplug your WR850G and plug it back in.&nbsp; You now will have debricked the WR850G.<br />12. Reset your local machine&#039;s IP address and mask back to where it was (DHCP on my machine).<br />13. If you have loaded the OpenWrt firmware, telnet in and change the &quot;lan_ipaddr&quot; NVRAM value to 192.168.1.1 and reboot your router.</p><p>*The reason we use leads 15-16 is because those address lines are right at the beginning of the kernel firmware area in the flash chip, and if the CFE/bootloader detects a corrupted kernel, it will automatically go into a TFTP receiving mode.</p><br /><p>For those of you who want to use a serial port and or JTAG adapter, I have some simple schematics/instructions that I will post later.&nbsp; You can get all the parts at Radio Shack for a few bucks and don&#039;t require any special skills to assemble other than soldering.&nbsp; (There are no ICs, only a couple of transistors, and everything can breadboarded).</p>									</div>
