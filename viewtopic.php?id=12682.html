					<p>Hi all, </p><p>Just went through some pain getting this done as RC3 doesn&#039;t appear to like tftp, and thought I might list what I recall of the process for future use.</p><p>Characters<br />&nbsp; My network: 192.168.0.x&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; polito: linux laptop, 192.168.0.23 <br />&nbsp; wrt54gs: openwrt White Russian RC3, 192.168.1.1 </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. download openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx file to polito from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/default/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/default/</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. alias eth0 on polito to see the wrt54 on the different network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&gt; ipconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. ssh into wrt54gs as root<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4. cd to /tmp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;5. scp .trx file to wrt54gs from polito.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&gt; scp vacri@polito:openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * couldn&#039;t wget it from the web for some reason, even after ifconfiging the wrt54 to match my network <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;6. flashed the firmware from within the wrt54, went off for a few minutes to leave it do it&#039;s thing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&gt; mtd -r write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Apparently 6 min is enough to wait, if it hasn&#039;t rebooted, you can manually reboot it then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * On reboot, pinging 192.168.1.1 works but can&#039;t ssh (since the root is disable)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;7. Telnet is open, though<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&gt; telnet 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;8. Change the password<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&gt; passwd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Adding a root password here blocks telnet access, forcing ssh connection in future<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;9.&nbsp; reboot wrt54gs and test ssh password<br />-----<br />&nbsp; 10. configure the box to be visible on the main network (not done yet - thought I&#039;d get this down first)<br />&nbsp; 11. unalias eth0:1 on polito with ifdown eth0:1 </p><p>I may have missed a small spot or two, but the above is basically how I got the thing upgraded from RC3 when tftp/atftp wasn&#039;t working and I didn&#039;t want to use &#039;crack the case&#039; methods. Just thought I&#039;d jot it down...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vacri</strong> on 24 Sep 2007, 15:51)</p>
