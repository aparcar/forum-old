					<p>WDS works ok with 3700 as it has two radios. I have used the 5 GHz radio for WDS and left 2.4 GHz radio for clients.</p><p>With my own build, available from the community section, (and the new ipv6-support modules for ipv6), the config was simple.</p><p>Config is here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=186066#p186066">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 66#p186066</a></p><p>Later in the thread there is one complaint about transmit power with WDS, but I haven&#039;t tested it extensively and as my build has no special components regarding the radio, I am not paying too much attention for that. The same should also apply to Arokh&#039;s build, as far as I know.</p><p>EDIT: wiki recipe is <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a><br />WDS in brief: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 28 Dec 2012, 17:50)</p>

					<p>I am looking at linking the routers using ethernet and not by wireless.&nbsp; I specifically ran an ethernet connection from the closet to the other side of the house so I wouldn&#039;t lose wireless speed as my goal is to eventually stream HD movies to outside and work from my backyard, which needs as much bandwidth as I can get on the home network.&nbsp; Is this called a &quot;dumb AP&quot;?</p><p>DD-WRT has a pretty easy to follow guide which is how I have a wrt54g setup that I will place in the garage for some other stuff.&nbsp; But I remember it was a pain to get working correctly with the WNDR3700 v1 that I have.&nbsp; Openwrt and Netgear firmwares were the only ones I could get to consistently work with the radios for some reason.</p>									</div>
