					<p>Hello everybody! </p><p>First of all, I would like to thank you for the great work, even though I understand very few of it.</p><p>I have the ZXHN H108N router that is flashed with a Greek provider&#039;s firmware. This router, as you probably are familiar with, maintains a USB port for network HDD. However, the custom firmware does not have any dedicated menu in order to enable Samba. Moreover, it does not have any option for updating the firmware.</p><p>Therefore, my question is summarised as follows: Is there any way, to enable the Samba to this router by forcing a firmware update?</p><p>Please take under consideration that I&#039;m completely dummy and I would greatly appreciate detailed instructions or directions for studying.</p><p>I look forward to receiving your feedback!</p>									</div>

					<p>Following my studying, I understand that since the router is not listed in the supported hardware, I should find one with the same hardware. According to this guy (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42889">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42889</a>), there is a similar model. So, I need to go here (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/adb/p.dg_a4001n1">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/adb/p.dg_a4001n1</a>). Now, what i cannot figure out is the following:<br />- What to download<br />- What are the next steps<br />- If it is possible to have a backup from the current firmware</p><p>Please provide me with your comments/feedback.</p><p>Thanks,<br />fanis</p>									</div>
