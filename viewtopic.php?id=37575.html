					<p>First of all, you need to read Openwrt documentation.<br />It is a bit long, but good for you to understand what is it.</p><p>Then, the ordinary Openwrt firmware you downloaded from openwrt site are NOT include webui,<br />means that you will never and cannot and impossible to connect in browser after &quot;fresh&quot; flashed.</p><p>If you need webui, need to connect in browser,<br />you need to first &quot;telnet&quot; to 192.168.1.1...... then setup the network part of your openwrted router, then install the webui, start the http service,<br />afterward you can connect in browser.</p><p>You don&#039;t need to search the internet,<br />just go to <a href="http://openwrt.org">http://openwrt.org</a></p>									</div>

					<p>No, telnet and ssh are tools to connect to the system console there. You can&#039;t use a web browser. You end up in text-based Linux command console, to which you need to type the commands manually...<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#Telnet_clients">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet#Telnet_clients</a></p><p>I use Putty as the client.<br /><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 18 Jun 2012, 14:20)</p>

					<p>If telnet close instantly, means that telnet service is disabled.<br />Normally if you have set new password, telnet will disable and enable ssh.</p><p>Are you just fresh flash your device ?<br />Where did you get your firmware ?<br />did you try ssh ?</p>									</div>

					<p>That is not the same router...</p><p>He talks about wr941nv2, which is supported by Openwrt, so he found a suitable Openwrt firmware and used that to flash an original TPlink firmware back to the device.</p><p>Your router is w8901g ver 3.1.</p><p>Looks like there is no connection to Openwrt:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34527">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34527</a><br /><a href="https://www.google.fi/search?q=+site:forum.openwrt.org+openwrt+w8901g">https://www.google.fi/search?q=+site:fo â€¦ wrt+w8901g</a></p>									</div>
