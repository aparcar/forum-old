					<p>I often forget to close vi after editing some files, and logoff. <br />Since ash doesn&#039;t send $whatever signal to kill running processes when i log off, vi keeps running. The problem is that as soon as i have logged off, vi goes crazy and monopolizes all the cpu, which causes the router to crawl. <br />I suppose it isn&#039;t a problem if you logoff via the exit command since ash will refuse to do so if there are running processes, but i use putty so i regulary forget to kill those running jobs before logging off and my colo users yell at me because &quot;i&#039;ve messed something with the router again&quot;&nbsp; =/</p><p>So, is there an easy way to either : <br />- have ash send the appropriate signal ? <br />- do something about busybox vi so it doesn&#039;t behave like that ? <br />- find if some vi processes are running and nobody is logged in to kill them ? <br />I was about to write a little script to do that but noticed that &quot;who&quot; is not there... any idea on how to find if there are some users logged without it&nbsp; ?? </p><p>btw i have this vi behaviour on wrt54g v1.0 and 3.2 , with openwrt rc3 and rc4</p>									</div>
