					<p>I moved recently and I&#039;m trying to get my ADSL connection working.</p><p>My DSL link is solid, and it works great if I use my ISP-provided DSL router.&nbsp; However, it doesn&#039;t work very well at all if I try to use a DSL modem and OpenWRT&#039;s PPPoE.</p><p>I am running the latest and greatest trunk (as of yesterday), 3.18.21 kernel, and I experience dropped packets with pppd.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried half-bridge, where the DSL modem negotiates the DSL connection and then forwards the WAN IP to the internal interface.&nbsp; That way my OpenWRT router gets the external IP without using pppd, and everything works.</p><p>Except that the two ADLS modems I have are flaky and unsupported in half-bridge mode.</p><p>So... Anyone familiar with half bridge mode that can recommend a solid, dependable ADSL modem?</p><p>I&#039;ve found the Linksys AM300 which seems to be supported, but it&#039;s not available in Canada.&nbsp; </p><p>I can get a TP-Link TD-8616 which may support half-bridge but it&#039;s unclear to me if it does and the documentation is contradictory.</p><p>Any recommendations?</p>									</div>
