					<p>In general, you should update to Chaos Calmer 15.05.<br />SQM packages are found natively there, and also otherwise it is much more modern.</p><p>The plain scripts may not help you much, as you need also a ton of kernel modules, which the normal installation would install for you.</p><br /><p>EDIT: hmmm. your router has only 4 MB flash.

					<p>Hi robi62,</p><p>I agree with hnyman, switching to CC would be much nicer, though I share his concern about the flash size. His idea about the required modules also is not completely off the mark manual installation is not going to be simple. I am not 100% certain, but I believe that sqm-scripts also entered the BB repositories, but that certainly is not the most recent version, so if at all possible CC15.05 would be a much better base.</p><p>Also I note that you don not really specify on which interface you connect to your neighbor. If you use a wired connection via the WAN port there is a good chance to get out working, if you connect via WLAN it will get trickier...</p><br /><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually there is the 1.0.3 sqm-scripts (of September 2015) for the 14.07 branch, so it is recent.<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/for-14.07/net/sqm-scripts/Makefile">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blo â€¦ s/Makefile</a></p><p>But no binary package is available for download, so it needs to be built by the user.

I have never used wonder-shaper myself, but looking at <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/net/wshaper/Makefile">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blo â€¦ r/Makefile</a> I believe the following files should be removed:<br />/etc/init.d/wshaper<br />/etc/hotplug.d/iface/10-wshaper<br />/etc/config/wshaper</p><p>Now, I am not sure which of those will be removed by &quot;opkg remove wshaper&quot; but I believe you can go and manually delete any leftovers...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
