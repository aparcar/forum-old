					<p>I try to flash openwrt for my tplink 1043nd router.&nbsp; After a try, I try to flash it back to original firmware.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it fail.&nbsp; When I power it up, the led lights keep flashing.&nbsp; After searching the internet, I know that I can flash it back by using a usb-ttl cable.&nbsp; Then I buy one and try it.&nbsp; When I connect the cable and then power up the router, the led lights up and my console got grabbage.&nbsp; I then reboot it again, now no led got lights up, it seems it is totally dead.&nbsp; Is it now total brick?&nbsp; I found that if I connect with Vcc,, the led lights will keep flashing like previous.&nbsp; Can I still make it work again?</p><p>Thanks for any suggestion.</p>									</div>

					<p>What model of usb-ttl did you buy? Can you provide an URL?<br />Don&#039;t connect Vcc of the serial adapter and the router.<br />Next step would be to turn the console garbage into proper output. There were rumors that recent versions of the 1043 need a pull-up resistor between its Tx and Vcc. A 10k resistor will normally do.</p>									</div>
