					<p>I have been testing TL-WA730RE v2 on Openwrt for several days on wireless repeater mode, repeating the primary router with antenna removed (this way I can be fairly certain it is the repeater&#039;s signal that I am using, not the primary router&#039;s). The unit will still freeze after &lt; 2 hours of use, unfortunately. Not even heavy usage; occasional Youtube, some browsing and social apps. Typical user, one may say.</p><p>So I guess it still needs more development time.</p>									</div>
