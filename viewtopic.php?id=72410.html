					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>Thank you for all the help with my previous topic of helping me creating a masqueraded private network with my dual band repeater. For those interested, look [here](<a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/help-creating-private-network-with-dual-radio-repeater-hotel-wifi-travel-router/7632">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/help-c … outer/7632</a>).</p><p>Right now my setup is as follows:<br />_Private Wifi Network_ &lt;-- 5 GHz --&gt; _RE450 Repeater_ &lt;-- 2.4 GHz --&gt; _Main Router w/ Internet Access_</p><p>My goal is to have all internet traffic originating from the _Private Wifi Network_ pass through a VPN tunnel.</p><p>Many guides exist to achieve the same but most of them are written with a single band router in mind. Personally, I wanted to be able to switch on/off the VPN easily (without SSH) using the LuCi UI so I chose to follow [this](<a href="https://www.robertkehoe.com/2015/08/setup-openvpn-using-openwrt/">https://www.robertkehoe.com/2015/08/set … g-openwrt/</a>) guide.</p><p>However, again since the guide is made with single band routers in mind, he mentions that the firewall forwarding settings should be like:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config zone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;VPN_FW&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; other options</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config forwarding&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;VPN_FW&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039; </p><p>Below is a pictorial depiction of what he mentions. Should this work? If yes, it maybe a problem with the VPN itself.<br /><a href="https://ibb.co/fMgzd6"><span class="postimg"><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/grYqkm/Screen_Shot_2017_10_24_at_9_33_41_PM.jpg" alt="https://preview.ibb.co/grYqkm/Screen_Shot_2017_10_24_at_9_33_41_PM.jpg" /></span></a> </p><p>Since I am using a dual band radio, I already have the following forwarding settings in my firewall:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;wan&#039;</p><p>I tried adding two forwarding configs such that it forwarding from lan -&gt; VPN_FW -&gt; wan but that did not work. My non-working forwarding config looked like follows:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config forwarding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; other dest &#039;VPN_FW&#039;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config forwarding&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;VPN_FW&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039; </p><p>Would appreciate if anyone could help me with the correct firewall settings to achieve this.</p><p>Thank you! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openwrt_newbie999</strong> on 25 Oct 2017, 05:34)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t understand LuCI in firewall application well, but you can configure it yourself via command line: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=72112,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=72112,</a> <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=72132">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=72132</a> Forwarding just enables forwarding, but what to do with specific packet, routing rules direct.</p>									</div>
