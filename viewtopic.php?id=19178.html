					<p>Hi.</p><p>The rules generated by LuCI are indeed in /etc/config/firewall. However, LuCI covers everything this iptables abstraction layer provides, so you won&#039;t be able to achieve your desired behaviour by editing /etc/config/firewall. As an alternative solution, you can add this to /etc/config/firewall:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config include
  option path /etc/firewall.user</code></pre></div><p>The file /etc/firewall.user is treated as a plain shell script then which is executed right after the default rules are built. Put manual iptables commands there to redirect traffic originating from lan and targeted at your wan ip to the correct chain.</p><p>~ JoW</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jow</strong> on 3 Mar 2009, 19:46)</p>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>If you want to change the default behaviour, you would have to change the uci firewall backend in /lib/firewall/uci_firewall.sh. You&#039;ll see a fw_redirect() procedure there which generates the actual port forwarding rules. I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s solveable in a generic way, afaik you&#039;d need to create appropriate iptables rules in each other zone when adding a portforward, so that it does not only match traffic from e.g. wan-&gt;lan but lan-&gt;lan or xyz-&gt;lan too.</p><p>If you extend the firewall uci (which happens indirectly by editing the shell backend) you&#039;d have to add the appropriate optiosn to LuCI too which is not that hard, but one step at the time.</p><p>Afaik UCI is no BSD thing, iirc it was developed as successor of the old nvram based config system but I might be wrong.</p><p>HTH, JoW</p>									</div>
