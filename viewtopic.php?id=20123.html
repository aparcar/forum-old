					<p>Hi all,</p><p>my DSL-provider (Deutsche Telekom) disallows multiple DSL-connections originating from the same MAC address. Is there a way to &quot;fake&quot; the MAC address when connecting? Debians package of rp-pppoe is patched to allow the use of &quot;-H xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&quot;. Applying that patch to rp-pppoe sources and compiling them for OpenWRT worked like a charm but I&#039;m not shure if it will reallly set the MAC address as specified (and I don&#039;t want to try at the moment &#039;cause there have been to much outages in internet connectivity over the last weeks).</p><p>Does anybody have solved this issue? Are there other ways?</p><p>tia, thorwin</p>									</div>
