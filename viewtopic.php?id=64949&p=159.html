					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Haven&#039;t been here for a long time; likely before the OpenWrt / LEDE split.</p><p>Many years ago when programming in C for Windows; the group I was with used Borland and Microsoft compilers.<br />Over the course of a few years we compiled ALL software with both and ALWAYS tested both.</p><p>We preferred Borland because of the smaller result. BUT, as Microsoft updated Windows versions; Microsoft always had the edge because of information passed between departments at Microsoft and ALWAYS seemed to work until Microsoft posted changes and Borland caught up.</p><p>Code previously used and compiled successfully would fail when newer development tools were used to compile the old code and spit out pages of errors.</p><p>My question is this.</p><p>As Linux evolves; are the companies / groups / individuals that make development tools all on the same page at any point in time.</p><p>Are some calls / commands being deprecated (early on) and then denied (in new development versions).</p><p>Do each of you know; we (collectively) know the tools used for the Linus / Linux base code; the tools used by LEDE; the tools used by OpenWrt; etc.</p><p>Respectively; not all dev tools will recognize EVERY PIECE OF CODE that is used (to create a new branch; fix an old issue or generally consolidate old code into new code)</p><p>Might some of the current issues fall into the above.</p><p>Could @davidc502 ALL other code producers here; ALWAYS list their tools (with version numbers) so that apples ARE NOT compared to oranges or a squash.</p><p>Could this post be posted (forwarded) to LEDE and dd-wrt and others currently generating Linksys firmware.</p><p>Maybe; just maybe; some of the issues are caused by variances in development tools.</p><p>THEY ARE NOT ALL THE SAME and IF they are; one is the original and the rest are selling bootlegged copies.</p><p>Please don&#039;t take this the wrong way; but if every tool is the same; (which should NOT be possible because of tweaks) the others are copies. I have never seen original anything that is identical.</p><p>Over time all tools will level out; BUT the future ALWAYS interferes to chase tomorrow which is always good.</p><p>Current kernel is 4.9; 4.4 is dead ( kicking up compile errors that never used to fail) and 4.14 is on the horizon.</p><p>Exactly what tools are being used with 4.14? and where we (you guys - not me - a Windows programmer from here).</p><p>Thank you Davidc502 for all your efforts.</p><p>There are some anomolies / aberations here that make little sense.&nbsp; Code that worked should NOT fail (Time) as newer versions of anything are introduced. A clock is a Clock is a clock; unless code cleanup generated tighter code and a NEW Compiler.</p><p>Welcome to tomorrow! Yesterday IS ALWAYS IN THE PAST.</p><p>Perhaps this post can help.</p><p>Rick</p><p>RickStep<br />Hamilton, ON, Canada</p>									</div>

					<p>What happened is LEDE. That&#039;s the only router i have that doesn&#039;t preserve configuration. Formatting all memory, then copying back 20 files is a joke. In other routers configuration was preserved through years of updates. Imagine Windows asked at each update to go through registry and fix inconsistencies there.<br />6 hours of very efficient operation speak of itselves. It&#039;s definitely not right for me. Might be ok for super basic configuration.</p><p>What I had to fix:<br />- almost all screens of UI<br />- /etc (tons of files, init.d, hotplug.d, adblock corruption, ..)<br />- /mnt (if you don&#039;t have folders created, mounting fails)<br />- readd ssh certificates, remove dropbear<br />- /home/* restore<br />- /lib required readd of some LUAs<br />- /overlay started filling up its space while mounts were not working (yup, it simulates samba and copies files there until free space is zero and packages cannot be installed lol)<br />- /usr some script fixes<br />- file permissions to improve security<br />- dnsmasq-full just to get connectivity and install 258 packages (some already installed), since dont have comparison script, had to do manually</p><p>It is NOT right.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi wrtuser123&nbsp; if you would like some changes pleas rite some bug reports on the LEDE fly spray.<br /><a href="https://bugs.lede-project.org/">https://bugs.lede-project.org/</a><br />That&#039;s the best way to get LEDE the way you would like.

					<p>So I got my WRT1200AC v2 yesterday and put the latest build on it and it runs decent so far. There were a few glitches with LUCI in the beginning not able to set the default root password. I had to disable all the non working and redundant stuff like dnscrypt, igmpproxy, qos, samba, ect. 5GHz wifi signal seems a bit weak of about 60% of what Luci says even with all clients directly in the same room or just 1-2m from the router in direct view, though I am not sure if thats a correct value. A few questions:</p><p>1. is there a way to tweak HW AES acceleration more for OpenVPN-openssl (if even possible)? So far I am able to reach about 70mbit/s down and around 25mbit/s up with then CPU0 or 1 capping at 100% (I know it cant use more than 1 core). I am using AES-256-GCM and also put &quot;engine cryptodev&quot; in the client files, which doesnt seem to make a difference though it stays at around 70mbit/s. So I am not sure if it really uses an acceleration library.</p><p>2. I am having https/DNS issues randomly at my clients where for example Chrome says &quot;resolving host...&quot; or &quot;establishing secure connection...&quot; and nothing happens for 20-30 seconds, then suddenly the page pops up and all is working for&nbsp; a few minutes, then randomly it happens again. Pinging works constantly though so there is no package loss.</p><p>3. noticed some files are saved directly into / why? For example &quot;.rnd&quot; or &quot;.wget-hsts&quot;. Shouldnt those go into /tmp (ramdisk) or ~?</p><p>4. how come the build just uses 16MB of the 128MB flash? Is the old Linksys partition not touched or? Would sysupgrades work normally from now on or are they dangerous? I read something about that before on here.</p><p>5. is the above talked about wifi fw fix/update also coming for the wrt1200ac or ins that one affected?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 18 Nov 2017, 14:04)</p>

Cryptodev has never worked as well as it should in my opinion. <br />2.&nbsp; Seems dnscrypt is being used? What IP is being used to forward requests?<br />3. Not sure if there&#039;s an environment variable which would need to be set up to make all downloads go to a certain directory like /tmp.&nbsp; If so, I&#039;ve never tweaked them. <br />4. This build uses some of the more popular packages and luci-apps, and leaves the rest to be installed by the user. If you have a specific request to add, depending on what it is and what it does it could get added.<br />5. The current wifi issues are all related to the 3200acm. However, expect additional wifi teaks which will affect the 1200/1900 line.</p>									</div>

I have four dnscrypt instances and each will show they&#039;re successfully retrieving server certs. Occasionally one will start misbehaving and I&#039;ll see one of the instances unable to fetch new certs. In that situation, refreshing the resolver file can fix it, or the issue will appear to fix itself after some time. Either way, when the all servers option is used in dnsmasq I would assume it wouldn&#039;t matter anyway if one fails when there are three others that don&#039;t have issues. Yet, it&#039;s usually when just one is malfunctioning that I see the long pause in resolution before serving the website as @makedir was describing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anymouse617</strong> on 18 Nov 2017, 18:47)</p>
