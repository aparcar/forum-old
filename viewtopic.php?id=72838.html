					<p>Hello, I need some help with my configuration.<br />I have two wifi running in my openwrt, the default, that is restricted by MAC address and the gust one, which people can access by password. Each one has its own interface.</p><p>The problem is that some clients connect on ethernet are going through the guest interface, which is unwanted, I can tell by the IP associated to them.</p><p>How can I configure openwrt so all ethernet clients are associated to the default network?</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to bridge the restricted wi-fi and the logical interface associated with the Ethernet ports together using the &#039;option bridge&#039; UCI configuration line.</p><p>If you need more help in resolving this, post the content of your &#039;dhcp&#039;, &#039;firewall&#039;, &#039;network&#039; and &#039;wireless&#039; files located in /etc/config folder.
