					<p>Hey fellow Openwrt&#039;s</p><p>Where I live public IP&#039;s are a rare thing so accessing services behind NAT&#039;s on the go is a pain.</p><p>I managed to finally get my own OpenWRT router on a friends connection with a public IP so I can now ssh in from anywhere.</p><p>I have successfully been able to create an SSH tunnel to access Luci and it works.</p><p>My problem is that I&#039;d like two SSH clients to be able to talk with eachother. I&#039;d like to create a tunnel on both connections that allows me to run a VPN connection through to the other client.</p><p>How do you suggest I best configure the openwrt router to relay traffic from one local port to another and vice versa?</p><p>I&#039;m guessing I do it with iptables.

					<p>Hello,<br />sorry to take advantage of your topic but I have a similar problem, I need to login remotely via SSH on a machine with fixed IP, to do this via LUCI I did without problem, but to do the same via SSH I was not lucky, I intend to change the access door as a way of minimizing the risk of invasion, but I really need this access to be able to hit some remote config if I need to</p>									</div>

					<p>Dropbear supports simple tunneling. So if you run </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh -R 1000:localhost:1000 user@openwrt</code></pre></div><p>on one client, and </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh -L 1000:localhost:1000 user@openwrt</code></pre></div><p>on the 2nd, you can connect on client2 to port 1000 on client1 by connecting to localhost port 1000.</p><p>If you run a VPN server on client1, you can connect from client2. Don&#039;t expect high throughputs, the router has to de- and encrypt each package. Depending on the CPU of the OpenWRT box, it&#039;s possible that the maximum throughput is less than 1Mbit.</p><p>By the way, have you considered dynamic DNS to bypass the dynamic IP problem?</p>									</div>
