					<p>:-(</p><p>The reason I chose 2.4 is that I need the wifi and I have little budget left to replace Asus&#039; wifi card with an atheros card because I have 20+ routers to be deployed...</p><p>Anybody with experience of pwc on 2.4?

					<p>ok, I really wanted to get this work and I had a feeling that the problem was configuration - probably sampling too fast from the camera given the error msg. So I sat through the day and brute force different option combinations. Eventually, it turned out that I needed to set the width to 160 and height to 128 (in motion.conf), much smaller than the original default 320:240, even if the camera quickcom zoom itself can support 640:480. Now I can get tiny images but at least they are not greenish and distorted! Hopefully this will be useful to someone else using pwc on a 2.4 kernel.</p>									</div>
