					<p>hi,<br />I&#039;ve probably done something wrong..... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I&#039;ve got a tp-link wr1043n router installed with the latest openwrt firmware.<br />I wanted to use the wan port of this router as a normal lan port, so I thought I should use the vlan options (via the luci web-interface).<br />I clicked &#039;add entry&#039;, and then on the vlan#2 line set a tick on all the ports from port0-port4 and the cpu port.<br />Clicked &#039;save&amp;apply&#039; and then I lost all connection to the router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I can still use all the ports as a normal switch, but I can&#039;t access the router itself (either via ssh or via the web-interface), and there&#039;s no link between wifi and the lan ports.<br />Does anyone here know how to solve this ?<br />Thanks,<br />Herman</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that was indeed the missing link, I made a very small modification to the settings above, eth0.1 =&gt; eth0 in the &#039;config interface lan&#039; section. Now I have all 5 ports of the switch available for my lan, and I still can reach the router itself.<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>
