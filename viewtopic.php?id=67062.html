					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m looking to get a small, portable travel router running OpenWrt that I can use to connect to public / hotel wifi spots using the built in WiFi and route all my traffic over TOR and/or OpenVPN by connecting my laptop to one of the Ethernet ports on the device.</p><p>I&#039;m interested in the two possible devices from GL Inet.&nbsp; They come with OpenWRT installed, but I&#039;d like to flash with my own clean image as don&#039;t require any GUI access.&nbsp; Has anyone installed OpenWRT images onto these devices, and can you give any advice as to how it is done?</p><p>The documentation on these routers seems a little bit sparse, though the devs are quite actively supporting.</p><p>Many thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Some of the older models have been patched and are in DD and in LEDE, but I do not think any are in CC, other than the 6416.&nbsp; I know GLi is submitting patches, but how fast they get incorporated is unclear.</p><p>There are &quot;clean&quot; versions, which are GLi versions similar to trunck (no GLI GUI) available for most here.<br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/">http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/</a><br />Look for a folder named clean.&nbsp; The AR-300M is not available yet &#039;clean&#039;.</p><p>For a travel router, the GLi GUI is a great tool for connecting to a station, much easier than Luci.&nbsp; It is something you will need to do every time you change locations.&nbsp; It also has USB configured, and the latest versions have VPN installed.&nbsp; Just load a config to your service.</p>									</div>

					<p>I made an CC openwrt firmware for my ar150 with all the &quot;good stuff&quot; and it&#039;s using a streamlined qmp mesh system with 7 radios on 802.11s. It&#039;s a &quot;hybrid GW&quot; node&quot; using BGP,&nbsp; a little bit of borgbox and pineapple goodies and all modules for my wifi antenas. It&#039;s also extroot ready and switch between encrypted usb pivot root and internal flash overlay. I screwed up tbe safeboot and made it almost hackerproof by hardening openwrt, uboot and serial console access. The only way I can get in if I get lockdd out somehow I think is with the usb stick. </p><p>Believe me, I have had a MR-3020 &quot;auto first-boot&quot; on me with safeboot disabled. I could recover the system with my usb only.</p><p> I&#039;ve my own strict firewall script which I first generated than perfected by comparing versions and learning iptables. I recently tried dnscrypt-proxy, ultimate privacy proxy (squid-privoxy-tor). I use sqm,&nbsp; piratebox, multiwan, adblock, watchdog, freeradius, dns-sec (unbound+dnsmasq coexisting for local name resolution, ad-blocking, spycam, tor,&nbsp; etc.. Can I add more to this?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cihuafreenet</strong> on 9 Feb 2017, 07:17)</p>
