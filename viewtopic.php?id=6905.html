					<p>Hello there, </p><p>I´ve been trying to establish a vpn (openvpn) connection between two linksys.</p><p>LAN SubNet (10.10.1.0) --&gt;(10.10.1.80) Server WRT VPNLNK(192.168.100.1)&lt;-----&gt;(192.168.100.2)Client WRTVPN(10.10.1.86)--&gt; LAN Subnet(10.10.1.0)</p><p>I need a VPN server on my lan to be able to establish communication with the machine on the remote location. I´ve tried bridged with no success and routing with no success either. Can you give me a hint? I have RC5 functioning well with ppp0 estaablishing good connections. I´ve managed to actually ping each WRT with success in the tunnel, but the machines cannot comunicate.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Pessanha</strong> on 16 Aug 2006, 14:55)</p>

					<p>What does logread on the server show when you try to ping from a host behind the client to a host behind the server?&nbsp; I bet it&#039;s saying something like &quot;MULTI: bad source address from client [w.x.y.z n], packet dropped&quot;. (where w.x.y.z is the IP address of your client).</p><p>It doesn&#039;t look like you have a &quot;client-config-dir&quot; directive in your server config.&nbsp; Without that, and the associated &quot;iroute&quot; command in the client file (on the server), you&#039;re never going to route.&nbsp; You can verify this with the error message above.</p><p>See the <a href="http://openvpn.net/howto.html#server">openvpn 2.0 howto server sample config</a> and look for the iroute statement (it goes in the client file on the server, not the client)</p><p>Also, re-read the section on routing.&nbsp; It&#039;s very confusing at first (even for network engineers!) because of the way OpenVPN does &quot;internal&quot; routing.&nbsp; You need to read it a few times to understand what they&#039;re doing.&nbsp; </p><p>So, the long and the short is, your &quot;route&quot; command are probably correct, but you also need &quot;iroute&quot; commands to complete the routing config.</p><br /><p>G</p><p>edited to include the correct error message after I googled it up :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bluesguy</strong> on 18 Aug 2006, 14:34)</p>

					<p>Hi there. Thanks for the reply. </p><p>Actually my first experience with the config files in opnevpn was having that clause client-config-dir with multi-clients configuration.&nbsp; But that didn&#039;t work.

					<p>Make sure you understand the difference between the &#039;push &quot;route x.w.y.z/nn&quot;&#039;, &#039;route&#039;, and &#039;iroute&#039; directives.&nbsp; If you&#039;re using the &#039;route&#039; directive you MUST have an associated &#039;iroute&#039; directive or your traffic WILL NOT GO THROUGH.</p><p>A &#039;push &quot;route w.x.y.z/nn&quot;&#039; on both sides advertises the subnet behind the local WRT to the remote WRT on the other end (although it could be used for other purposes).&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; the client pushes his network information to the server, and the server pushes his network information to the client, so that each end knows what the other end looks like.&nbsp; This directive tells the <span class="bbu">remote</span> end to add an entry to its routing table so that the remote end knows where to send traffic for the local end&#039;s subnet.</p><p>Alternatively you can use the &#039;route&#039; and &#039;iroute&#039; directives.&nbsp; The &#039;route&#039; directive changes the <span class="bbu">local</span> routing table, typically for destinations somewhere behind the remote end.&nbsp; If you do this, you MUST have an &#039;iroute&#039; directive so that OpenVPN knows that it should allow this traffic to be routed.&nbsp; </p><p>Both methods will allow hosts behind the local end to traverse the VPN and reach those destinations on the remote end without the hosts themselsves having to know the routes, since the router is doing the routing :-)</p><p>Now, if your OpenVPN endpoint (either client or server) isn&#039;t the default gateway for the hosts, then you need to do the above configuration, as well as adding routes to the host(s), so that they know when to use the OpenVPN tunnel, and when to use their default gateway.&nbsp; In this case, the hosts are the one&#039;s making the routing decisions of which traffic to send to the OpenVPN endpoint, and which traffic to send to their default gateway.&nbsp; When the host sends traffic to the OpenVPN endpoint, the OpenVPN endpoint still needs to know how to get to the other end of the VPN tunnel, so its routing table still needs to configured using one of the two methods described above first.</p><p>Again, the openvpn 2.0 howto describes all of this.</p><p>Also check your firewall.&nbsp; You need to allow traffic on and off the tun devices.&nbsp; Something like this is /etc/firewall.user should do the trick.</p><p>iptables -A forwarding_rule -i tun+ -o $LAN -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A forwarding_rule -i $LAN -o tun+ -j ACCEPT</p><p>Sorry for the long winded answer on routing, but hopefully that helps.</p><br /><br /><p>G</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, just wanted to let you know that i ve managed to put it to word in bridged mode. Being a host and not a default gateway, i needed to put some rules on my gateway firewall. Another error came up this morning (i left it communicating all night to test liability). When i tried the ping between server and client a error came up:</p><p>P_CONTROL_HARD_RESET_CLIENT_V2.</p><p>I know i have to establish some kind of ping routine so it doesnt&nbsp; loose communication. Whats the best way?. I have a directive in server config which looks something like this:</p><p>keepalive 10 120 </p><p>Is there a better way. Does the client need it also?</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the information I was giving above was for routing mode.&nbsp; For bridging mode, some of it is different.&nbsp; The <a href="http://openvpn.net/faq.html#bridge1">OpenVPN FAQ</a> describes the differences.</p><p>To answer your question, you really need to use the keep alive directive on both ends.&nbsp; From the <a href="http://openvpn.net/man.html">OpenVPN 2.0.x man page:</a></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>--keepalive n m
    A helper directive designed to simplify the expression 
of --ping and --ping-restart in server mode configurations.

    For example, --keepalive 10 60 expands as follows:

         if mode server:
           ping 10
           ping-restart 120
           push &quot;ping 10&quot;
           push &quot;ping-restart 60&quot;
         else
           ping 10
           ping-restart 60</code></pre></div><p>And from the --ping flag</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&quot;...specify --ping on both peers to cause ping packets 
to be sent in both directions since OpenVPN ping packets are 
not echoed like IP ping packets&quot;</code></pre></div><p>So, in other words, you need to use keepalive on both ends.</p><br /><p>G</p>									</div>

					<p>It could be that the problem is with the firewall rules and the interface names on the linksys device.<br />I had a similar problem on a wrtsl54gs.
