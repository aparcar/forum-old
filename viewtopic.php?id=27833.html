					<p>Hi</p><p>I have tried to build openwrt for a d-link DIR-300 rev B1 following a guide here in the forum</p><p>But the router now is not working at all. I cannot reach it in any way. Tried to connect to the wan port, lan port with DHCP and manual Ip address, via telnet, http ..</p><p>I also tried to boot in recovery mode, without success. But I have understood that this mode no longer exists after uploading openwrt or dd-wrt</p><p>How can I try to upload a new firmware? I have seen here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300revb">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300revb</a> that the device has a serial interface .. can I use it to try to upload a new firmware?</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Alessandro</p>									</div>
