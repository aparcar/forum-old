					<p>Hi there!</p><p>There is an idea I came up reading about wep weakness and I thought this might be a good place to share it and learn if it can be acomplished.</p><p>I understand that wep attacks are based on brute force against a fair quantity of collected packets of information, either with a passive attack or an active one increasing the traffic on the network.</p><p>My question is: what if purposedly the members of a wep network send &quot;poisoned&quot; or bad encrypted packets to other members, in such a way that those packets would be silently ignored ... the attacker could be mis-leaded on his brute force attack?</p><p>The poisoned packets could be sent at regular intervals (say.. 1 each random(3~5) seconds or whatever is needed) or as a response for suspicious of traffic increasing requests.</p><p>Could something like this make it harder to break wep networks or the attacker would recognize and discard those misleading packets?<br />Anyone with good background on the topic cares to comment?</p><p>Could it be implemented on openwrt or this type of behaviour can only be implemented on the wireless chip?</p><p>Thanks for any comments on this idea, at least I&#039;d like to know why it wouldn&#039;t work.</p><p>I care about wep security since I&#039;ve learned here that ad-hoc mesh networks with openwrt can&#039;t be secured with wpa, so wep and open network are the only options at hand.

					<p>I&#039;m pretty sure you can&#039;t use WEP in these networks and that you can do WPA, but not WPA2. WEP was broken long ago and I don&#039;t think you should consider pursuing &quot;fixing&quot; it by making it broken (sending out false information). You&#039;re only going to bog the system down with processing the &quot;poisoned&quot; packets and not to mention taking the radio&#039;s bandwidth with what is essentially static. For cracking WEP you collect at least 10000 packets and can crack in ten minutes. I don&#039;t know what ratio of bad packets you&#039;d have to make, or if that would do much anyway (you can probably detect which is poisonous anyway when you compare the 10000+).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your answer napierzaza!</p><p>Could you please tell me more about the setup of ad-hoc with wpa? does it works on kamikaze or whiterussian?</p><p>About my proposal, I don&#039;t think that lots of those &quot;decoy&quot; packets would be needed, and maybe they could be constructed in such a way that other members of the network could easily identify and ignore them.</p><p>I believe a small amount of those packets would be hard to spot while trying to break the key by a brute force or &quot;trial and error&quot; attempt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Weedy, are you using an OpenWRT unit to do this? I wanted to experiment with it but I couldn&#039;t get it working! </p><p>So as you can see Capaz it doesn&#039;t take much to crack WEP. Really you should just run using WPA anyhow, especially because WEP also slows your connection more than a WPA. And it doesn&#039;t really matter how many fake packets are needed, it will still take processor power and bandwidth, and it will still hackable, maybe it will take 40 seconds.</p>									</div>
