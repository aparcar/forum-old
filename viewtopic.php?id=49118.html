					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>Over the past few weeks, I&#039;ve been using Open-WRT on a Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H router.&nbsp; After using DD-WRT until recently, I can&#039;t say how much I love Open-WRT!&nbsp; During testing, I had it plugged into my Comcast Gateway and tried many different configurations and settings.&nbsp; Last night, I finally replaced my primary home router (WNDR4500) with it.&nbsp; What an improvement!</p><p>Anyways, one of the packages I installed was bandwidthd which can be somewhat load intensive.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been monitoring the load, but to be honest, don&#039;t know what scale to compare my numbers to.&nbsp; </p><p><span class="bbu">I know this is a newb question, but what scale is this on? 100 meaning my peak so far has used 6.23% of resources?</span> </p><p>Below&#039;s a screenshot of my load this morning (operating at 100% download speed and with bandwidthd + other services running.)&nbsp; If you can&#039;t see image, here are the stats:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://guidesforit.com/share/load.png" alt="Router Load" /></span></p><p><strong>Load </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Average</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Peak</strong><br />1 Min&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.23&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.24<br />5 Min&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.02&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.02<br />15 Min&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.23&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.23</p><p>I&#039;ve searched all over for more detail about this, but couldn&#039;t find anything detailing what I&#039;m trying to find out.</p><p>Any info would be helpful.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BzowK</strong> on 20 Feb 2014, 20:13)</p>

					<p>OK - You aren&#039;t kidding.&nbsp; I disabled bandwidthd and my average went down to 0.35 / 0.21 / 0.18.&nbsp; Question, though...&nbsp; If it was using x6 my CPU resource, how come when I viewed the &quot;Processes&quot; nothing looked like it was using much?&nbsp; Is it because the bandwidthd process wasn&#039;t being monitored as a process (At least in that view?)</p><p>Upon disabling bandwidthd, it had been running for ~20 straight hours.&nbsp; During this time, many downloads were made, videos streamed, and I stayed logged into RDP remotely most of the time.&nbsp; Speed didn&#039;t seem to be affected that I noticed.&nbsp; I&#039;d think if the hardware was running so behind that I&#039;d notice some kind of affect.&nbsp; Why didn&#039;t I?</p><p>Thank You</p><p>One more thing... so my router (WZR-HP-AG300H) has a 680Mhz CPU, 32mb rom, and 128mb RAM.&nbsp; To be able to run something like bandwidthd 24/7 I assume I&#039;d need something much more powerful.&nbsp; What&#039;s a dependable router which will reliably run OpenWRT which has a faster processor (if any)?&nbsp; Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BzowK</strong> on 21 Feb 2014, 01:39)</p>

					<p>let openwrt sort out the contention. it seems to be doing an able job. if you didn&#039;t notice any adverse effect, how does it matter? and if you don&#039;t really need to see it real-time, perhaps run bandwidthd with low priority?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>What do you need bandwidthd for? Do you really need to have a per-host usage graph?</p><p>I dropped bandwidthd for the exact same reason. I use vnstat instead. It provides banwidth graphfs per interface only, so it&#039;s limited to wan, lan, vpn and every other vlan you create. But that&#039;s enough for me. I don&#039;t care about per host brandwidth, so that&#039;s fine for me.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
