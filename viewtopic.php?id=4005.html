					<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I think you meant &quot;have TO read&quot;.&nbsp; Just F.Y.I., I read the FAQ.&nbsp; (And searched the Wiki, the forums, IRC logs, web, etc...)&nbsp; Yes, &quot;rerun the script&quot; probably should&#039;ve ringed the bell, but it didn&#039;t at the time, hence the posting.</p><p>There are other issues here regarding support for different types of users, some which were actively discussed on the IRC channel last night, but this is not the time or place to go into details.</p>									</div>
