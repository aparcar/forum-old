					<p>I purchased a TP-Link Archer C7 when it was first released with the hopes of having an AC router supported by OpenWRT. I recently got my home media server back online (raid controller failed, quite expensive to replace/upgrade) and realized that this router doesn&#039;t support Jumbo frames. At all. OpenWRT lets me set the MTU to 9000 but packets of that size don&#039;t ever go through the router. </p><p>So now I&#039;m out on two counts with this purchase. I&#039;d like to mention that eventually this access point will be behind a 24-port gigabit switch and either an Edgerouter Pro or a custom pfsense/untangle router and will only be handling wifi clients at that point; that said, right now I need a preferably budget solution that achieves the reality of Openwrt with Jumbo Frame and Wireless AC support. Does anything like this exist?</p>									</div>

					<p>The switch chip in that router does support jumbo frames, and looking at the driver, it should be even enabled by default. Can you check whether two devices in the same subnet connected to two switch ports on the router are able to communicate with jumbo frames? In this configuration MTU of the OpenWrt interfaces shouldn&#039;t play a role.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you bought it &quot;when it was first released&quot;, then it is a C7v1.<br />Care to explain just how you managed to get the AC card working? ath10k dropped support (before it ever actually functioned) for the 9880-AR1A that it has.</p>									</div>
