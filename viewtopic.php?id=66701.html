					<p>Hello everyone<br />I am developing&nbsp; localization algorithm in which needs to measure&nbsp; RSSI&nbsp; for the same mobile from different AP.<br />I have already measured the RSSI for the associated mobile but I don&#039;t have any idea how to measure the RSSI for the mobile that not connect the AP.<br />Any information about this will be a great help.<br />Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Moh.Qaid</strong> on 9 Aug 2016, 22:59)</p>
