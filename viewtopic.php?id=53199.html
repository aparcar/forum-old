					<p>Hi Omiez,</p><p>you probably know this, but you can only use PPPoA if your router has a direct ATM/ADSL link (the oA part of the akronym means &quot;over ATM&quot;). So if you have an external DSL-modem PPPoA on the router will not work for you.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you moeller0. </p><p>Your answer was the most simple to understand because after benms answer i had to search til i understood that an internal modem is required for PPPOA to work.</p><p>I was just wandering if it was technically possible to make something like PPPOA to work on a bridged modem but you can deduce now that i am not that familiar with connections. LOL</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Omiez,</p><p>some modems/dsl-routers offer to translate a PPTP connection from a router/client via ethernet into PPPoA over the ATM link, (see for example <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPPoA">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPPoA</a> ). If your modem does support that you need to set-up your router to use PPTM to talk to the modem. But again this really depends on your modem supporting this mode, which as far as I know is rare. According to wikipedia this seems to be used in Austria, so maybe getting an austrian adsl-modem might do the trick (I would first research which austrian ISP&#039;s still use this method and then would try to get a used dasl-modem from that ISP (potentially branded?) vie e-bay... Also I would check whether Austrian modems support the required Annexes for my country)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hope that helps...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
