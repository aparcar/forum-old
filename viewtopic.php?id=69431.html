					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I found what I believe to be a bug, but would appreciate anyone who can confirm it also as an issue.</p><br /><p>Running 15.05.1 on a Bullet M2 device.</p><p>After a clean install, or reset, when I perform a WiFi scan, Hidden networks are displayed in the list, as they should be.</p><p>After I connect to a network (non-hidden), and perform another scan, hidden networks are no longer displayed in the scan results.&nbsp; All the non-hidden networks show up as expected.</p><p>If I disable the wifi-iface that I connected to/created, hidden networks once again show up.</p><br /><p>So, there seems to be some issue with iwinfo when a wifi-iface has been defined, at least on Atheros devices.</p><p>I also installed the iwinfo bin file to run that manually.&nbsp; Same results.</p><p>When I run iwinfo radio0 scan it will show hidden networks if I have wifi-iface not defined, or disabled.&nbsp; Once it exists, or enabled, iwinfo radio0 scan does not show the hidden networks.</p><p>Anyone have any insight into this?</p><p>Thanks,<br />John</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to add to this, when I run iw wlan0 scan, that works fine, regardless of the existing WiFi connection.</p><p>In other words, iwinfo shows no hidden networks, while iw does.</p><p>So it seems to be specific to iwinfo itself, since iw works fine and I would imagine they both are using the same Atheros (compat) drivers for the results.</p><p>If someone can point me to the right place to log this issue, I am happy to do so.</p><p>Is iwinfo part of OpenWRT?&nbsp; Or a separately maintained package?</p>									</div>
