					<p>Hi all</p><p>Let me first introduce myself: I&#039;m a belgian .NET developer, so no professional on unix systems, though having some experience.</p><p>About my question: I have had nginx running as a reverse proxy for some time now, which works quite well.&nbsp; Because the fact of running a web application, which I want to have running over https, I found on the internet that this was possible with nginx, but soon I found out that the nginx version running on my Attitude 12.09 openwrt was too old.&nbsp; Then I found out this was possible with haproxy too.&nbsp; But, then I found out that also the haproxy version was too old (1.4).</p><p>Is there an option of building the latest version of haproxy on my Attitude 12.09 openwrt (D-link 825 B1).</p><p>Best regards<br />Steven</p>									</div>

					<p>You do realize that AA is ancient? Without having personal experience with that specific device, I don&#039;t see any reason an 8 MB flash/ 64 MB RAM ar71xx router wouldn&#039;t work just as well with a modern version, which in turn would rise your chances quite significantly.</p>									</div>
