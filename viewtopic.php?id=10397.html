					<p>We had 2 routers show up with the same public IP address on the WAN interface today.&nbsp; Both are WRT54G/GL (version 3 or up)&nbsp; running Whiterussian 5.</p><p>Sure enough both routers had wan_hwaddr set to the same value.&nbsp; But that value was 00:90:4C:60:00:2B which is something I&#039;ve not seen before.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t know how wan_hwaddr would be set to this value in the first place (other than manually which I&#039;m sure I didn&#039;t do).</p><p>A quick check shows that /etc/init.d/S05nvram has something about a default MAC address that looks like the above value, but it is not clear under what conditions wan_hwaddr would get set to such a value by the router firmware, if at all.</p><p>Thanks for any insight,<br />Bill</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wtrenker</strong> on 20 Apr 2007, 00:07)</p>

					<p>I just came across this myself on my WRTSL54GS, I&#039;m not sure how this value was set, but I found it in my nvram.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/init.d$ nvram show | grep macaddr
il0macaddr=00:16:b6:cf:37:76
et0macaddr=00:16:B6:CF:37:74
et1macaddr=00:90:4C:60:00:2B
size: 11347 bytes (21421 left)</code></pre></div><p>So, I reset the value to what it should have been (according to the label on my WRT), and after a reboot all was well.</p><p>How this value came to be set previously, I do not know.&nbsp; What led me to discover this, was that I had finally swapped my old router out, and found that my WRT wasn&#039;t picking up a DHCP address from my cable company, and all diagnostics here indicated that it should have been working.&nbsp; I have to assume that someone else on my local cable system has a similar issue with their router and has the same MAC address as well.</p><p>A google for that MAC address turned up a number of pages, including three threads here:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=78">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=78</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=36343">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=36343</a><br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7996&amp;p=2">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7996&amp;p=2</a></p><p>It appears that the common theme is folks have reset their nvram, which I had done myself also, though at this point I can&#039;t remember the exact steps I used myself.&nbsp; Obviously a bad value is being left as a default when this is done, and it is never being properly updated.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRTSL54GS seems to have this default too, I found some info in the Wiki about <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq?highlight=%28nvram-clean%29#head-71cacf8460752af3f5771d2fae54923ded5beb9c">clearing the NVRAM</a> safely:</p><p>My et0 and il0 addresses were set correctly, presumably via the first boot process or startup scripts, but et1 is the WAN port on the WRTSL54GS, and since that had a bad value it was the cause of my issues.</p><p>I&#039;m a little unclear about what the /etc/init.d/S05nvram script is doing, since it is checking the WiFi port against this 00:90(etc) address, so maybe some models are setting the wireless port to this also? </p><p>I&#039;m thinking that at this point it may not be worth opening a bug report as kamikaze (I believe?) won&#039;t rely on nvram settings.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to have much chance to test that, though, since I just put my router into production and can&#039;t afford to monkey with it until I pick up a spare.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>While this topic is being discussed I&#039;ve added these NVRAM variables on both my units:</p><p>lan_hwaddr=00:14:BF:(unique)<br />wan_hwaddr=00:14:BF:(unique+1)<br />wl0_hwaddr=00:14:BF:(unique+2)</p><p>I&#039;m sure 999 of 1000 users never need it but I used an old PPPoE bridging trick by connecting WAN to the same network as the LAN.&nbsp; Without defining wan_hwaddr the WAN and LAN end up with the same ethernet address - which can ruin your day when connecting them together. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 23 Apr 2007, 00:43)</p>
