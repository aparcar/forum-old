					<p>Hi all,</p><p>We are a small co-op wireless community; the goal of the community is a decentralized network that grows, configure and heal itself without too many IT guys but, above all, without telcos. In priority order: reliability, then performances.<br />I&#039;m the &quot;IT guy&quot; of the community and I&#039;d like to plan a migration from Sveasoft firmwares to OpenWRT as soon as possible, beacouse I don&#039;t like their business model. I used to pay 20$/y to support the developers in doing a sort of mankind&#039;s treasure, not a company&#039;s business. PLEASE HELP!!!!</p><p>As I write our WRTs (7 up and running, 3 up to come, many others waiting) are connected with a feature called by Sveasoft &quot;p2p wds&quot; that means:</p><p>Node1: br0=lan+wlan clients on 192.168.1.0/24, wds0.2 on 10.1.2.1/30, wds0.3 on 10.1.3.1/30<br />Node2: br0=lan+wlan clients on 192.168.2.0/24, wds0.2 on 10.1.2.2/30, wds0.3 on 10.2.3.1/30<br />Node3: br0=lan+wlan clients on 192.168.3.0/24, wds0.2 on 10.1.3.2/30, wds0.3 on 10.2.3.2/30<br />and so on...</p><p>The routing is OSPF, all the lan+wlan traffic is shaped with QoS (voip+smb needed) and we have two internet gateways on two nodes WRT&#039;s WAN ports. Equipment is WRT54G v2.0 and v2.2, we have 1.5MByte/s on every link (300-900 meters).<br />Configuration was still incomplete but I&#039;d like to reach redundancy and load balancing. Now I prefer to first bring everything on OpenWRT and then continue developing on it.</p><p>While waiting for 3 new WRTs to make a test lab, I searched the forums and finally found this message where mbm suggested, by playing with bridges and vlans, a way to have 1 radio serving both wds links and clients:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=7841#p7841">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=7841#p7841</a></p><p>but, as I can understand, I should have STP once I create redundant links and I couldn&#039;t find any info about enabling stp!</p><p>Is it possible to migrate to OpenWRT mantaining the nodes indipendant (node subnet, node dhcp, etc), having link redundancy and load balancing on internal routes and internet routes?<br />Is it possible to change OSPF with OSLR to take advantage of the Link Quality features?<br />Is it possible to mount a distributed and redundant filesystem on WRTs so that I could avoid using a server for small additional services? (thinking at coda; maybe fuse?)</p><p>(Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong)</p><p>ciao</p><p>Wallace78</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you RItalMan and Nico,</p><p>I&#039;ll surely try that setup (lan wds with stp) before going to mesh it beacouse it is simpler (&quot;Make it sumple stupid!&quot; continue to ripeat myself when working).</p><p>But my goal is to have fully l2 and l3 indipendant links: so, no br0 (and no stp needed) and an w.x.y.z/30 for every wds0.x interface. Then have OSPF (OSLR if possible) to automagically set up the routes, make the mesh fault tolerant and manage load balancing.</p><p>My major problems are:</p><p>1) how to avoid hotplug to put wds0.X interfaces in br0? Or, as a workaround: can i remove them from br0 at boot time or they are built/destroyed everytime the radio link is established?<br />(EDIT: mbm says this in <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=6707#p6707">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=6707#p6707</a> but it is quite cryptic)</p><p>2) Can I use OSLR instead of OSPF to reach failover/load balancing and add (over the actual ospf setup) Link Quality feature that OSLR have (can&#039;t remember the name of the plugin)?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Wallace</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wallace78</strong> on 12 Jul 2005, 01:59)</p>

Our goal is to provide a self configuring, self building, self healing, decentralized cheap network... the holy graal...</p><p>I prefer to think to a WDS setup to save one radio each node and have lower troughput, instead of implementing an Ad-Hoc mesh. And I need much much work to understand everything and be able to plan, develop and deploy a custom solution as SWON (Aladin, etc) and others (wildcat) did... I&#039;m pretty newbie on wireless, have limited development skills and find hard also to get the clue on these advanced networking matters!<br />Moreover there&#039;s no business at all behind my community; nor willing to pay from users, neither someone paying for development and no big saves on internet and phone bills...</p><p>I want to go from Sveasoft to OpenWRT even it needs more work, beacouse I believe in the Open philosophy but can&#039;t make much kilometers all by myself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I know I&#039;ll have to work on it for long time, but I prefer hard work to go back to a quick &#039;n&#039; dirty Sveasoft&#039;s firmware.</p><p>In this scenario a wds setup, with ospf, some custom bash scripts, maybe frottle, Aladin and OSLR are a better choice. IMHO.<br />Can OSLR run on non-adhoc mesh networks built on routed wds links?</p><p>Questions are more and more everyday... I hope to quickly clear some of them as soon as I get the 3-APs&#039; testbed and to not find too many seg faults...</p><p>Thanks for your tip!</p><p>Wallace78</p>									</div>

					<p>For those migrating from Sveasoft then the following article may be of interest - I have modified the hotplug script to use existing sveasoft nvram variables - it should bring up your p2p links just as sveasoft does.</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3494">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3494</a></p><p>I am going to start on quagga ospf conversion aswell. i.e to generate ospfd.conf from the Sveasoft nvram vars just as the original.&nbsp; The aim will be to be able to flash openwrt on to an existing Alchemy build router, download a couple of scripts and the router will behave like it had under the Sveasoft firmware.</p><p>Just so that there is no misunderstanding, I am not knocking Sveasoft in any way - infact I am a big supporter.&nbsp; However, there are applications where the Minimalist openwrt framework is the better choice.</p><p>I believe it is possible to support both firmwares without being fanatically partisan to either.</p><p>KR&#039;s</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>
