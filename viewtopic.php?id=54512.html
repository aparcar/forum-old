					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>i recently bought the TP-Link WDR 4300 and flashed OpenWRT, but found out that im most probably happier with the stock... Id love to have alternative firmware running on it, but as im a totally bloody beginner, it would take me ages til i reach the point where i have working timescheduled wifi on/off, usb printer/scanner server, dvbt stream,.... so as i had a look at how it looks like with luci straight after flashing, i think by now i want to give the stock firmware a try.</p><p>OK, i just want to make shure i dont brick it now, so could you have quick look and tell me if im right with the following:</p><p>According to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a> I just need a firmware from the manufacturer without boot in it, and I found a firmware that suits:<br />wdr4300v1_en_3_13_31_up(130319).bin</p><p>So i just need to &quot;upgrade&quot; from within the WebGUI with that firmware-image? And afterwards upgrade to the latest available Stock-Firmware?<br />It is the oldest firmware available, does that cause any problems?</p><p>Anything else i might need to take special care of? Thank you so much for clarifing and prevent me from bricking my device! :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes it should work ok.<br />As last check have look at firmware file size (in bytes), it must be equal to the size of the openwrt &quot;factory&quot; image you used..</p>									</div>

					<p>yes, that&#039;s what I did exactly. Once back on the basic stock firmware, you can upgrade step by step to latest version of stock firmware.<br />you can flash Openwrt anytime.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks guys for clarifing! It worked flawlessly - though i had to manually reboot it after flashing and waiting for 10mins but nothing happend. anyway, after that i was back on stock, could upgrade to the latest stock, and afterwards switching to DD-WRT.<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
