					<p>Hi guys.</p><p>Sorry if this is a FAQ, but I&#039;ve spent quite some time reading FAQs and the wiki, still I couldn&#039;t find any answer to the following:</p><p>I have an existing OpenWRT config on one router. It is pretty polished, and I want to copy this config to a new router (different device, but similar architecture, WDR3500 vs. WDR4300). I want to do so in an as-&quot;portable&quot;-as-possible way, so that also next time I upgrade the router to a new OpenWRT release I can reapply the current config with as little effort as possible.</p><p>What is the &quot;best&quot; way to do so? Is it to dump the existing config with &quot;uci,&quot; then to clear the factory config on the other device with &quot;uci&quot; and apply the to-be-ported config with &quot;uci&quot; again?</p><p>Ideally such procedure would even account for different hardware/switch architectures, i. e. WAN port might just be a port on the same switch (selected by VLAN tagging), or WAN might be dedicated ethN interface, etc.</p><p>The rationale is that manual configuration is very time consuming, and also very error-prone: Configure networking (I have dual-band radios with an extra &quot;guest&quot; WiFi per radio, so configure SSID for each, WPA2 passphrase, MAC filter, FW config, IPv6 config, etc.), install packages required, configure them, etc. etc.</p><p>Thanks for any help you can give.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Ralf</p>									</div>

					<p>Had the similar problem.</p><p>I made a &quot;dump&quot; of the current configuration with &quot;uci show&quot; and then made a shell script not very much unlike what adam2104 suggested.</p><p>There are a few tricky things, sometimes uci show will display stuff like &quot;network.wan.dns=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&quot; in one line, however you need two lines of code to set this:<br />uci add_list network.wan.dns=&quot;8.8.8.8&quot;<br />uci add_list network.wan.dns=&quot;8.8.4.4&quot;<br />Some other things require &quot;uci add&quot; command before you edit those. </p><p>I wish PMs worked here, so I could send you a sanitized copy of the script I&#039;m using, maybe it will help.</p>									</div>
