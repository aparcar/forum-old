					<p>Hello, i have a DIR-300 B1 and after i performed a reset to defaults i can no longer login to the gui when i go to 192.168.1.1 it says &quot;LuCI - Lua Configuration Interface&quot; and thats it. After that it goes to non existing page or something.</p><p>How can i get everything working again ?</p><p>Edit :</p><p>I figure out myself using ssh</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install luci<br />uht tpd enable<br />uht tpd start</p><p>but still how i can safely only reset to default settings ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>markokk888</strong> on 7 Dec 2017, 22:41)</p>
