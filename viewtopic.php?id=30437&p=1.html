					<p>as JonnyM already said the power amplifier(s) cannot deliver more output power than what they have been designed to do even though the radio chip and driver software are providing and have been set to do more power.<br />When you look in the specifications of power amplifiers there is an issue with them starting to amplify less linearly when pushed to their limits, or in other words they start to introduce distortion. The sophisticated modulation schemes used in 802.11 (the way the radio signal is given its data content) require very linear amplification (the output being a precise multiple of the input). The effective data throughput may actually suffer as the linearity decay destroys more than the bit of extra power brings. For best performance it is wise to set the system a few dBs under the limit the power amplifier has been specified for (to account for calibration inaccuracies and spread between systems). Non linear amplification may also produce spurious signals.<br />There are only a few manufacturers of these amplifier ICs which require special production processes and you may have a look with a magnifying glass which actual PA chip has been designed in and check out its specs.

					<p>Again, the power levels reported by iw reg and friends are *regulatory* limits. They&#039;re not related to hardware capabilities.<br />The FCC test reports for the WNDR3700 indicate around 17-23 dBm peak power output per antenna chain in OFDM (11g) mode. In 11n its even slightly less.</p><p>You can look it up yourself in test report 15C at page 66 and following; <a href="https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=278475&amp;fcc_id=%27PY308300092%27">https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/rep … 8300092%27</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Could you explain a little?<br />Why can some people set more than 17dB while it doesn&#039;t work for me? Don&#039;t we have the same hardware?</p>									</div>
