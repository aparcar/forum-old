					<p>Hey gang, just wanted to say that you all are doing a killer job on OpenWRT!<br />I do have a request/question:</p><p>Would it be possible to add in mysql logging to the tinyproxy OpenWRT package?&nbsp; I looked around google, and came up with nothing, the only thing I could find was in the SourceForge mail-list archive, here:&nbsp; <a href="http://sourceforge.net/search/index.php?words=mysql&amp;sort=score&amp;sortdir=desc&amp;offset=0&amp;group_id=2632&amp;type_of_search=pervasive&amp;pmode=mlists">http://sourceforge.net/search/index.php â€¦ ode=mlists</a>&nbsp; In the answer it makes it sound oh-so-trivial.&nbsp; I&#039;m no coder, by any means, so I&#039;m in no position to make a judgment about the difficulty of doing it.&nbsp; If it isn&#039;t too much trouble, it&#039;d be badass to have that kind of functionality in the WRT build.&nbsp; It just seems like a natural fit for running the proxy on a device where space is of the utmost concern.</p><p>I&#039;m more than open to helping out, but I have no idea what I could bring to the table as, like I said, I&#039;m pretty useless with the coding.&nbsp; But if there&#039;s anything I could do to help should someone decide to take this on, I&#039;m game, so lemmie know.</p><p>Keep up the good work!</p>									</div>
