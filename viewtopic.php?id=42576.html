					<p>Hi everybody. This is my first post here. I tried to find solution on this forum but failed, so I have to ask myself (sorry if I repeat the question, but I couldn&#039;t find the solution).</p><p>I have built my own custom image because I needed as much space on my TP-Link MR3020 as I could get. But now I have a problem with rootfs capacity. df -h returns 680 kB as an entire capacity of rootfs. Only ~200kb is used, but instead of having more than 3mb free I have only ~480 kB. Why is my rootfs not ~4MB in size (that&#039;s the ammount of 3020&#039;s flash)? Size of the compiled bin file is ~3.9MB. I&#039;m using squashfs to save space.</p><p>My custom image made the situation worse than generic one. I must have missed something in menuconfig or something before that. I tried two times with the same result. Please help. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I concur. But I need that free space to store something else (something that is yet to be programmed). How do OpenWRT developers achieve free space in their images? Here is the result of my df -h:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc# df -h

					<p>@ipha: Yes, I could, but It doesn&#039;t work smootly. I end up with ext4-fs error. Flash drive is unmounted and then immediately mounted as read-only.
