					<p>there are some interfaces configured in /etc/config/interfaces, and some one depends on some other, ex. the pptp-vpn intefaces depends on pppoe-wan to be connected first. <br />It is a bit slow (more than 2 min) for my interfaces to be ready. <br />I doubt the startup order is incorrect. </p><p>So, my problem is , how do I known the startup order of these interfaces, and how do I change it?</p><p>thanks.</p>									</div>
