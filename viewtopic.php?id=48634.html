					<p>Hello guys, I am using a TP-LINK TL-WR740N and in this morning after a long period of problems with it ( it gave me limited connectivity all the time ) I decided to do something about it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First I wanted to upgrade firmware, but I got an error code 18005.<br />After that I saw something about OpenWRT and decided to try it. After that, I&#039;ve noticed that my configuration was gone, so i had to reconfigure it. I reconfigured the WAN with PPPoE and i think here i did something wrong, i changed the LAN to PPPoE too. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now i cannot access it. If i use Ethernet through router i got unidentified network and if i try to access router via browser, it shows like i want to connect to any other site so i got error message that i am not connected to internet. Same thing if i try to use WI-FI with the difference that when i connect i have to try 3-5 times and after i get connected to router, i got limited connection and same problem. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any idea is good. Thanks in advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also run recvudp.exe for entering failsafe. I run TP-LINK easy setup assistant and it said &#039;make sure ur router DHCP Server is Enabled&#039;. How do i check or how do i enable it? Also if this help you, LED config is the next one:<br />PWR LED is permanently lit<br />SYS LED blink about 2 times/sec<br />If I connect laptop to router the LED for 1,2,3 or 4 is permanently lit. Now i am bypassing router to access the internet. Any other idea? Thanks in advice.</p>									</div>
