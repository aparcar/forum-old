					<p>Hi.<br />I was annoyed at the crippled Busybox VI, and installed &#039;vim (Tiny build)&#039;.<br />To my surprise, whenever I run &#039;vi&#039; or &#039;vim&#039;, I still got the simple &#039;vi&#039;, instead of &#039;vim&#039;.</p><p>It appeared that the problem was because of a default alias in my /etc/profile of the format</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[ -x /usr/bin/vim ] &amp;&amp; alias vi=vim || alias vim=vi</p><p>Meant to make either &#039;vim&#039; or &#039;vi&#039; commands to run the same executable - /usr/bin/vim if exists, or default Busybox VI, if not.<br />This would work of course in the next reboot, but sourcing /etc/profile now wouldn&#039;t solve the problem, as it leaves the old alias in place, and appends another alias.</p><p>The solution:<br />After vim installation, the post-install scripts should run &#039;unalias vi vim&#039;, and then &#039;alias vi=vim&#039;</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
