					<p>drawz... good thinking! When I have started to think about this i realise that there are routers with &quot;partial&quot; support since 10.03, and routers with good support in trunk only. So the status concept is quite complex.</p><p>I have written a few simple scripts that download the five current lists (supported, unsupported, wip, unknown and possible), and merge the information. So far it does not work on all columns, but I intend to have some validations and/or sanity checks when I add more columns. And I can probably make this all-in-one-list available quite soon in a useful form.</p><p>I think it is good to start identifying/naming routers properly and cleaning up things that are clearly inconsistent.</p><p>I can imagine, in the future, a single list with all routers (all supported states), for search/lookup.<br />And then, a much shorter list of routers that actually work well with current OpenWRT release (dropping those without WiFi, and also those with less than 32MB RAM... my suggestion).

					<p>Is there a general overview page btw of conventions to be used? Like when to use &#039;unsupported&#039; (someone wanting a fully functional wireless router would consider his device unsupported if OpenWrt ran on it but didn&#039;t support the wireless, e.g.). I have people seen list devices as &#039;trunk&#039; under &#039;OpenWrt version&#039; just because the board booted on OpenWrt and basic images were available, but no wireless.

					<p>Nilfred, excellent <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> I deleted the link from WIP, and updated the article itself with a little notice that this router is candidate for status &quot;legacy&quot; or &quot;notfullyworking&quot; (not that there are any such statuses). And a link to your informative post.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just throwing in a bit about how I&#039;ve used the wiki in the past.&nbsp; As already mentioned above, some users don&#039;t care about wireless support, myself included, I run a separate wireless access point after my OpenWRT device.&nbsp; So knowing that something runs OpenWRT but the wireless is broke would be a valuable bit of info.</p><p>But for me, and probably others, probably the best improvement to the wiki (and probably time consuming to update) would be a list of shipping hardware that runs OpenWRT, so that someone could find something on the list, then go to Amazon, WalMart, or wherever, and pick up a device.&nbsp; With all the version changes breaking support, I know this would be hard to maintain, but it would certainly be nice to see.</p>									</div>

					<p>Very good idea!</p><p>So good that I&#039;m thinking: What&#039;s hindering in implementing this in the regular wiki?</p><p>Thoughts: The index.html you linked is only intended as a tool to cleanup the toh in the wiki, right?<br />The neccessary changes are done to the toh in the wiki and will be reflected in your index.html with some time-offset, right?</p><p>I&#039;d be happy to help in some toh cleaning and polishing! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Suggestion: Maybe it would help to setup some rules for the columns, e.g.<br />- &quot;CPU MHZ -&gt; only 0-9, no text, especially no MHz, since this is already given in the column heading; unknown = ?; no empty fields, i.e. at least ?&quot;<br />- &quot;Target -&gt; all lowercase; no uppercase; unknown = ?; no empty fields, i.e. at least ?&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 9 Apr 2015, 02:33)</p>
