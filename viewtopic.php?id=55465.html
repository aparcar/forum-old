					<p>Hi, I need some help configuring IPv6 params for a router acting as an access point for a home network. This is my network layout:</p><p>Cable Modem &lt;--wired--&gt; [WAN] TPLink WDR3600 [LAN] &lt;--wired--&gt; [LAN] Buffalo WZR-HP G300NH2</p><p>TPLink is 192.168.1.20, the main router, Buffalo is 192.168.1.10 the dum AP.<br />TPLink has WiFi clients and LAN clients. Buffalo has just LAN clients for now.<br />Buffalo has fixed ip, DHCP disabled for LAN interface. I didnt bother to disable the vlans (just need 2 LAN ports for now), so just disabled WAN interface.</p><p>Buffalo&#039;s config files:<br />/etc/config/network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

(currently is different and I cant even pingv6 one router from the other)<br /> - I changed ra &amp; dhcpv6 to relay from default server, as I was getting IPv6 adressed in both prefix ranges, I&#039;m not sure if thats correct, what is the difference between server, relay and hybrid?<br /> - I&#039;ve read the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">Dumb AP / Access Point Only</a> where it says:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>IPv6:<br />If you would like your AP to receive IPv6 as a host only and not for routing you have to tell dhcp6c not to request prefix deligation. If you do not do this the AP will reject basic IPv6 addresses.</p></blockquote></div><p>but I dont really understand what that means.</p><p>I&#039;ll be using a HeNet tunnel as my IPv6 WAN, I already got it to work with just the TPLink alone in the network, but I&#039;m not worried about that yet, I&#039;m asking how to properly configure both routers&#039; IPv6, one as the master and the other as the dumb AP just for my network</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thorazine74</strong> on 31 Jan 2015, 00:32)</p>
