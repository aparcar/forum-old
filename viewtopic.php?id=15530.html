					<p>I have a Fritz!Box which is my DSL router and a Linksys WRT54GL which shall connect another room with the internet. Therefore I flash the WRT with OpenWRT+X-WRT and tried to connect it with the Fritz!Box by WLAN, unsuccessfully.<br />I tried two ways, but both didn&#039;t work. The first way I configured the WRT as a normal WLAN client, in the 2. way I tried to use WDS.</p><br /><p>I was also logged in by ssh and logged into the Fritz!Box by HTTP. I saw the WLAN Monitor of the Fritz!Box and the WRT was always connected, but only for 1 second, then it was disconnected again. I tried it so many times and checked everything (eg. channel auto or both channel 6). I also saw, that the wl0 never had an IP address, by unsing ifconfig in SSH. I disabled all security, but the WRT didn&#039;t want to work as a client, why?</p><p>The second way: I activated WDS in the Fritz!Box and configured the MAC addresses. And the Boxes got a connection! Here you can see the WLAN monitor of the Fritz!Bix: </p><p>I think it is not hard to set up a WLAN connection, only these virtual adapters and interfaces are a little bit confusing, but I really don&#039;t understand why it doesn&#039;t work...</p><p>Can somebody explain it to me? Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fabske</strong> on 22 Oct 2010, 00:37)</p>
