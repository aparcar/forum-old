					<p>Hi,</p><p>can anyone explain what the switch <strong>Use builtin IPv6-management</strong> in &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; of the PPPoE protocoll does? I found nothing usefull in the wiki. In the source I can see that the option &quot;delegate&quot; should be set. But I can&#039;t find any changes after setting it. No option &quot;delegate&quot; has been set in my network config (or somewhere else).</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I found out that the option is only set on the wan6 interface and only if I disable it (option delegate &#039;0&#039;). But I still don&#039;t know what it does. I have ipv6 running without this option...</p><p>Thanks,<br />Monkey</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>monkey</strong> on 20 Jul 2016, 17:09)</p>
