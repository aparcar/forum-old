					<p>I&#039;d like to set up a box for travel that will connect to the internet over the wired ethernet port or as a wireless client.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen some discussion about setting up a box using two wired ethernet ports as WAN ports- has there been anything about using WAN and wireless?</p><p>The idea is that at a hotel I can plug this box into the wall, or connect to the hotel&#039;s wireless service, and this box will be a firewall between me and the rest of the world.&nbsp; (And a VPN between me and the home office.)&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to use a cable between the box and my laptop, but that&#039;s not too bad.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have two internet connections via wired and wireless on my WRT54G using WhiteRussian RC5.&nbsp; I got wireless client mode working first using the wiki instructions, then simply added</p><p>dsl_ifname=vlan1<br />dsl_proto=dhcp</p><p>to NVRAM and</p><p>ifup dsl</p><p>to /etc/init.d/S40network (where dsl is just an arbitrary name).&nbsp; Then I modified /etc/init.d/S45firewall to duplicate the entries for the wan interface.</p><p>I had to stop the interfaces from fighting over DNS and routing after that, but if you&#039;re only connecting via one or the other then that may not be an issue for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks very much!&nbsp; Yes- it makes sense about the DNS and routing.&nbsp; And I&#039;m going to have my own problems because openvpn doesn&#039;t seem to automatically do things right.</p><p>But that&#039;s a great starting point.&nbsp; I had no idea it would be so easy.</p>									</div>
