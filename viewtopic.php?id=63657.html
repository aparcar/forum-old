					<p>Thanks! From what I gathered there shouldn&#039;t be any more differences besides the model version embedded in the firmware header. It wouldn&#039;t be the first router where a manufacturer bumps the revision number over minor differences, &#039;breaking&#039; the image check in OpenWrt.</p><p>In fact, what you did with -F is exactly that: skipping the image check. You&#039;re knowledgeable enough to be aware there shouldn&#039;t be any technical hurdles in using a v10 image on a v11, but the average user is not.</p><p>Forcing sysupgrade or modifying the headers are workarounds till proper support is implemented; these images were built from an OpenWrt tree with proper support <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. It will be upstreamed once I get confirmation it is indeed working.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> It looks like the firmware works but I&#039;d need confirmation that the image can be flashed from a TP-Link firmware.</p><p>Would you mind reverting back to the original firmware and then trying to install my build through TFTP?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 27 Mar 2016, 00:21)</p>

					<p>Yes, I can confirm that both images are quite stable - 15.05.1 (without issues, except nonexistent source &quot;<a href="http://volatilesystems.org/dl/openwrt/chaos_calmer/latest/ar71xx/packages/">http://volatilesystems.org/dl/openwrt/c â€¦ /packages/</a>&quot; in /etc/opkg/distfeeds.con) and trunk (some issues: default access to shell for &quot;root&quot; without any password is granted, some minor issues in luci - also noticed in other trunk images)<br />In case of installing factory image 15.05.1 via tp-link web interface it is important to rename image file (use shorter name, e.g. tl-wr841-v11-factory.bin) - no need to use TFTP.<br />Wi-fi signal level and coverage are good, comparable to original firmware, system and kernel logs - without an errors. Do you need any other information? Thanks</p>									</div>
