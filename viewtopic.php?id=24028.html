					<p>Being in the root group would only give users privileges to access files/directories that users in the root group are allowed. That is, it doesn&#039;t give a user full root privileges. Having the same UID (0) would give them the same privileges as root. I&#039;m not sure if that is what you are wanting though. If you notice the files in /etc/config are not writable by the root &quot;group&quot; so you could make them writable (chmod g+rw /etc/config/*) or you could make the user equivalent to root by setting their UID to 0 but that is a little drastic.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I just tested setting the permissions on the /etc/config directory and the files in it and it seems there must be more to it than that. They should be able to edit the files directly but UCI must access something else that the permissions are not right on. I&#039;ll dig into it some more if nobody else has your answer. As far as your user being able to upgrade the firmware it sounds to me like this user should just have the root password.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ahh, figured out the problem. After setting the permissions properly on the /etc/config directory and the files in it I also had to remove the /tmp/.uci directory (or a reboot would have also wiped it out). Then I logged in as my test user and was able to change config settings via UCI with no problem.</p>									</div>
