					<p>Dear forum members!</p><p>Am I the only one who cannot open ports on a router running chaos calmer? This is a fresh install on a TP-WR842N.</p><p>External access is only working if I set the &quot;Input&quot; field to &quot;accept&quot; under:</p><p><em>network -&gt; firewall -&gt; general settings -&gt; zones</em></p><p>This would make 443;80;8080 ports open.</p><p>Port forwarding entries do nothing.</p><p>I cannot get the <strong>fwknopd</strong> opening ports, either...</p><p>Are they making opening ports difficult in openwrt in order to &quot;protect&quot; inexperienced users from the misery?</p><p>I dont really know what is happening, since I did everything as detailed in the official tutorials. I saw a video where a guy demonstrated the use of fwnkop2 android client, but when I did the same, nothing happened.</p>									</div>
