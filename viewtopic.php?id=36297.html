					<p>I have a small business website, nothing more than a storefront, that I host directly on my Linksys WRT400N using uhttpd.&nbsp; The website is currently little more than a skeleton but as I&#039;ve added features to my OpenWRT installation, memory is now at a premium and I would like to offload the website to external storage.&nbsp; As the WRT400N does not have USB ports, I cannot host the website from a local stick.&nbsp; What I do have is a WDTV Live Streaming which has USB ports and is always awake on the network.&nbsp; The WDTV shares attached storage over the network using what I believe is SMB.</p><p>Googling dredges up endless discussions of attached USB drives but nothing about a remote drive.&nbsp; How should I go about this?</p>									</div>

					<p>What is this smbclient you speak of?&nbsp; I have Luci&#039;s Samba plugin, which includes Samba 3.&nbsp; Luci&#039;s UI for it looks like it only handles sharing mounts that the filesystem has already attached.</p><p>I should mention that I&#039;m a noob with Linux.&nbsp; I have a good grasp of what I&#039;m wanting to do conceptually but I don&#039;t know the syntax for mounting a drive using SMB.</p>									</div>

					<p>I celebrated too soon.</p><p>I now want to automount the remote USB stick at boot.&nbsp; My first attempt was to add</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mount.cifs //IP.address.of.WDTV/Folder /mnt/Folder -o guest,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,nounix,noserverino</code></pre></div><p>to rc.local (Luci&gt;System&gt;Startup).&nbsp; I figured that if the command worked manually, it ought to work in rc.local.&nbsp; Wrong!</p><p>I googled around a bit and found mention of using fstab so I tried making an entry there.&nbsp; It shows up in Luci&gt;System&gt;Mount Points, it&#039;s marked Enabled, but it doesn&#039;t mount unless I do it manually.&nbsp; That&#039;s probably what <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10366">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10366</a> is referring to.</p><p>Next, I read that I should be using a hotplug script instead of fstab: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32812">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=32812</a>.&nbsp; What I understood was that I needed to create a file in /etc/hotplug.d/iface.&nbsp; I called it 41-cifsmount:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

[ &quot;$DEVICE&quot; == &quot;lo&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exit 0

. /etc/functions.sh
case &quot;$ACTION&quot; in

    if [ &quot;$DEVICE&quot; == &quot;br-lan&quot; ]; then
      mount -t cifs //IP.address.of.WDTV/Folder /mnt/Folder -o guest,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,nounix,noserverino
    fi
    ;;
  ifdown)
    if [ &quot;$DEVICE&quot; == &quot;br-lan&quot; ]; then 
      umount  /mnt/pub
    fi

					<p>20 seconds works for me.&nbsp; 10 was too short.&nbsp; 15 worked a few times but failed once, and I need a margin for error so the website that I&#039;m putting on this mount doesn&#039;t drop because the router booted a little slow.&nbsp; If I knew what it needs to wait for, I could kludge together a if statement.</p><p>I had added block-mount, block-hotplug, and block-extroot during my blind experimenting.&nbsp; I removed all of those and deleted the /etc/config/fstab entry for the mount and the rc.local command still works.&nbsp; To mount a CIFS partition, apparently all that is needed is cifsmount and kmod-fs-cifs (probably kmod-nls-utf8, too).&nbsp; I also removed all of the options except guest and I can still access the share fine.</p><p>I tried to push the start of the /etc/init.d/done script back from 95 to 100, because that&#039;s what calls /etc/rc.local.&nbsp; I then removed the delay in rc.local.&nbsp; However, the mount stopped loading at boot; I thought it was worth a try.&nbsp; There&#039;s too much there that I don&#039;t understand so I&#039;ll hope someone comes along with a more elegant solution.</p>									</div>
