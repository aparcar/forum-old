					<p>I bought a chinese router for openwrt development which has the following major components-<br />1. Mediatek MT7620A - router MCU<br />2. Winbond W971GG6KB-25 - 128MB RAM<br />3. Winbond 25Q128FVSG - 16 MB serial flash</p><p>Looking at the PCB, I found striking similarity with many other chinese routers except the RAM and flash chip. Even some popular names, such as- baidu router, xiaomi mini router probably followed the same schematic design.</p><p>However, I am confused about the wlan radio and driver. In the configuration of the router, it was mentioned that the wlan radio is RT2860 which I expected to be a hardware. But there is no wlan IC on board. What is the wlan radio for MT7620A? Which driver should I use to compile openwrt for this router? Since I can see the general configuration for MT7620A in the menuconfig, will that work for this router?</p>									</div>

I applied a patch for another router <a href="https://github.com/Akagi201/hiwifi-hc5661">https://github.com/Akagi201/hiwifi-hc5661</a> with similar configuration and successfully compiled openwrt for my router. Although I can see the product booting successfully and recognizing both LAN and alan, it&#039;s not assigning any IP to them , nor it&#039;s activating dhcp server. But I guess I will post another topic to ask for help about it. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

So, I didn&#039;t dare flashing the firmware without looking at the source code (and learning the specification of the board) first. However, since chinese router companies mostly use this repository, I will like to try compiling it for my router to solve issues with my router. Do you know where MT7620A target is in this repository?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmrasheed</strong> on 24 Aug 2014, 04:26)</p>

					<p>I just loaded the MT7620A-EVB firmware in the router&#039;s RAM without writing in the flash. It seems that both LAN and WLAN are working, but USB is not working. I guess I need to include the USB libraries to make USB working. However, I cannot find the source code tree or configuration files for this specific board. It is not listed in the chinese openwrt trunk-<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org.cn/dreambox/trunk openwrt-pandorabox</p></blockquote></div><p>Where can I find the repository (or the configuration files or patches) for this specific board?</p>									</div>

					<p>@mmrasheed</p><p>mt7620 is a SoC chip, with&nbsp; a 2x2 2.4G wifi module inside. </p><p>rt2860 is a very old product of ralink. since then, ralink keeps using this name in its wifi driver, even the chip has evolved to mt76xx already. ( prefix changed from rt to mt because mtk aquired ralink).</p><p>all the products you have mentioned, like xiaomi mini, baidu, are all using ralink&#039;s wifi driver actually. MTK did some tricks to make their driver work under openwrt framework.</p><p>as for pandorabox or dreambox, they are Chinese clone of openwrt project. They did some customization and localization.</p><p>Actually since last year, MTK has started officially support for openwrt in MT76xx series chips. They provide RD support to their customers, as well as to the community.</p>									</div>
