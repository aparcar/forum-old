					<p>Hi guys,<br />I&#039;d like to buy some new access point / router boards for testing network configurations by putting OpenWRT on them. Basically I need a board which is:<br />* Cheap.<br />* 1 or 2 ethernet ports.<br />* One wifi interface.<br />* OpenWRT supported (CPU supported, enough memory as flash and RAM).<br />* (optional) Equipped with extra GPIOs to connect MMC, USB keys etc.</p><p>Have you got any idea? I&#039;ve been searching the net for days but actually I didn&#039;t found anything interesting, apart fully equipped AP (with case and antenna included, when I need only the &quot;raw&quot; board).</p><p>Thank you a lot.</p><p>Francesco.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am very much looking forward to the Raspberry Pi, but I wish its name wasn&#039;t that. Fon or a Meraki Mini are also good, but maybe hard to find at this point. I and very happy with my Merakis since they have 8 GPIOs that are unused and on regularly spaced pins.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have some PC Engines WRAP.2E boards for sale. They come with an aluminum case but it can be removed. It has 1 serial, 1 ethernet, 1 a/b/g wifi card installed (a slot for another is present) and a 128mb CF card for flash storage. I have many of them if you are interested. OpenWRT Kamikaze is already installed with all drivers and it is working as an access point when shipped. CPU is 233mhz amd geode, with 64MB of ram. all drivers needed are avaliable and installed on the system. The LEDs are fully configurable as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stampede_dude</strong> on 9 Feb 2012, 18:38)</p>

					<p>Ok thank you all guys! I watched every product you posted, in particular tp-links which are cost-effective. Other solutions are still valid, Raspberry is much interesting project but I haven&#039;t found where to but it.<br />Do someone knows? Thank all of you again for your interest.</p>									</div>

					<p>GPIOs? I know the routerstation Pro has many easy GPIOs, but many devices do not. And having to scrape around the board for them is not easy and makes for a messy implementation. Raspberry Pi has a lot of good GPIOs too.</p>									</div>
