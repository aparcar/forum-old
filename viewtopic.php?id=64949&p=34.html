					<p>@anyone interested <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I think I finally found my answer to question of the difference between the 1900ac v2 (cobra) and the 1900acs (shelby), although <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series</a> lists them as having the exact same specs and wikidevi.com even have them sharing an FCC-ID. (They share the same FCC-ID because they have identical communication hardware; that&#039;s all the FCC cares about; the v1 has a different 5GHz power amp).</p><p>The openwrt wiki is incorrect.&nbsp; The cobra does NOT have 1.6 GHz cores.&nbsp; It has 1.33 GHz cores like the 1200ac (caimen) (which makes perfect since since they both were released at the same time).&nbsp; This is confirmed on Linksys&#039; website (http://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=143610 ; see the note below the chart below explaining what the LEDs do:</p><p>&quot;The Linksys WRT1900AC v2 is physically identical to the WRT1900AC v1 except for the following:<br />The Linksys WRT1900AC v2 is powered by a Dual-Core 1.3 GHz CPU<br />Uses a 12V 3A power adapter&quot;</p><p>However, even this note isn&#039;t completely accurate because v1 (mamba) has 256MB ram and an internal fan while all other models have 512MB and no fan). The 1.33GHz cores are also mentioned on the actual box that the cobra comes in.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>I believe the confusion is coming from DD-WRT builds having the cobra overclocked from 1.33GHz to 1.6GHz.&nbsp; No idea if LEDE/OpenWRT does the same.&nbsp; If the same is true on LEDE/OpenWRT, any chance @david could do the same with the 1200ac (caimen)?</strong></p><p>Wikidevi seems confused and has the cobra listed as 1.33GHz in one place, and 1.6GHz in another place, both on the same page.&nbsp; <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Linksys_WRT1900AC_v2">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Linksys_WRT1900AC_v2</a></p><p>Can someone who has access to editing the openwrt wiki please update to avoid further confusion by others in the future?</p><p>I also found the answer to my question of how many cesa cores the 1200ac (caimen) has.&nbsp; According to Marvel, the Armada 385 88F6820 SoC. has two cesa cores.&nbsp; So only the 1900ac v1 (mamba) has one with it&#039;s Armada XP MV78230 SoC.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 27 Dec 2016, 17:41)</p>

					<p>@davidc502</p><p>First off hello, new to the forum and have been reading along learning as much as I can for the last few days now. I thank you for all the hard work you have put into making these builds. I have just recently purchased a WRT3200ACM and so far your builds have worked the best for my purposes.</p><p>I believe you mentioned earlier that you would include kmod-sched-cake as a pre-installed package however I do not see it as part of the new build. Also along with cake would be helpful to include sqm-scripts-extra, as they go together as far as being able to configure cake in the luci sqm setup.</p><p>Thanks again, and keep up the great work. more than willing to help out in anyway I can.</p>									</div>
