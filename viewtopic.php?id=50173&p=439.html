					<p>@tomce<br />Thanks for the input. I have tied that.. Not saving settings and flashing image. Changing to pppoe and setting my username and password the same as in my dsl modem/router. For now I am back to running dmz so I can use <br />my vpn. I even reset the dsl modem/router no difference. The only problem with dmz is my system log is being filled with a lease time of 300.

					<p>Just an update I no longer believe it is OpenWrt or configuration issue for the PPPOE problems. I did something I have not done for around a year....I flashed Linksys OEM.<br />Results were the same no PPPOE connection after changing user and password (All old settings were there)&nbsp; I verified my username and password with frontier and no go.<br />Even though the girl from India said there were no changes made in over a year....BS! My user name was different from around 3 weeks or so ago when my problems started.<br />Also after I saw my name changed in their modem I noticed they reset my network setup. Everything Lan was&nbsp; 10.10.10.? Now back to default. This was before doing a reset on their modem. And after a reset I used to have to re-enter username and password this time it sorted it out by auto-magically. But it did drop everything else.<br />All tests &gt; PPPOE were done after disabling the DMZ. Time to corner a Frontier tech. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> .....
