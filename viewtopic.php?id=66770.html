The stock firmware ignores it and offers frequency and power choice based on the selected country code. OpenWRT however (as would a stock Linux kernel) respects the bit and applies a logic AND over the selected regulatory domain and the US regulatory domain.<br />Luckily, someone created a binary patch called reghack that replaces the in-driver US regulations with unrestricted ones. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>All informations here: <a href="http://blog.michael.kuron-germany.de/2013/08/openwrt-on-tp-link-tl-wdr3600-uncapping-wifi/comment-page-1/">http://blog.michael.kuron-germany.de/20 … nt-page-1/</a></p><p>The reghack utility<span style="color: red"> (tested on Barrier Breaker for TL-WR710N and TL-WDR3600)</span> replaces the regulatory domain rules in the driver binaries with less restrictive ones.

The hardware is capable of things that can interfere with radar etc. and you should never set it to a country code other than your current location. Even then, you might be able to choose options that are not legal to operate.</strong></span></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Almost all countries defines power limitations for Wi-Fi devices (<strong>EIRP</strong> max). <br />The key to applying these rules is to understand EIRP (Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power), which represents the total effective transmit power of the radio, including gains that the antenna provides (and losses from the antenna cable and connectors).</p><p>The EIRP is calculated using this formula:</p><p>EIRP = Effective Isotropic Radiated Power</p><p>Pout = transmitter power output (dBm)</p><p>Ct = signal loss in cable (dB)</p><p>Gt = gain of the antenna (dBi)</p><p>Pout - Ct + Gt = EIRP</p><p>When installing a wireless system with external (or internal) antenna, your EIRP calculation should not exceed the class license limit. Other wise you must adjust either the transmitter power output, the length of cable and/or the choice of antenna.<br />You may find the gain of a router antenna in the specification manual, this value generally includes signal loss in cable (the cable from the router board to the antenna).<br />The RP-SMA antenna connector (female+male) present in many routers, also has a little signal loss, but you can ignore it in the EIRP calculation.</p><p>Generally the internal antenna gain (antenna printed on PCB) of a router like the TL-WR710N is about 2 dBi.<br />The TL-WDR3600 has two external antennas with 2 dBi @ 2.4 Ghz and 3 dBi @ 5 Ghz gain each.<br />The small external antennas of many router, like D-Link 600, have 2 dBi gain, <br />just a few high power routers have 4-5 dBi antennas.</p><p><strong>Most of the time you get better results (coverage and signal improvements) by increasing the gain of the antenna than increasing the output power, more power means also more EMF noise and disturbances.</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pilovis</strong> on 12 Aug 2016, 13:24)</p>
