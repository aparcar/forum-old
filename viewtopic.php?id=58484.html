					<p>A bit OT but hopefully someone can help me out.&nbsp; My ISP is providing a static IP, but they do not provide DNS hosting for my domain names.</p><p>I need to find a service that I can use for DNS resolution for my domain names.&nbsp; Googling brings up lots of hits for services like OpenDNS, but none that I can find that I can use to register my domains.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to use a &quot;domain name registrar&quot; first to &quot;buy&quot; your domain name; just google &quot;domain name registrar&quot; and you will find lots of them.<br />Most registrars will also host a DNS for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh crap.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I really went down the rabbit hole on this one.&nbsp; I have several domains spread over several registrars, and I got so wrapped up in moving them all to a new ISP in a different country that I didn&#039;t realize the obvious.</p><p>I&#039;ll delete this bit of idiocy in a bit.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>There are plenty of registrars out there. That&#039;s the first step. Just like eduperez said, they usually come with DNS for you.<br />That&#039;s what I did.</p><p>Then I decided to give Cloudflare a try, basically to use their CDN service for static file delivery.<br />There I realized: They have a pretty nice and powerfull DNS management tool as well.<br />The only thing you need to do: Have a domain somehwere and point name servers to cloudflare.</p><p>Some time later I stumbled across hurricane electrics DNS service. It&#039;s not as nice as the one provided by cloudflare. But in contrast to cloudflare, they provide nice and easy &quot;dynamic DNS&quot;.</p><p>So my current configuration looks like this:</p><p>* &quot;mydomain.de&quot; regiterered &quot;somewhere&quot; (InternetX Gmbh, the company I work for has a couple of hundrets of domains there, so I got it basically for free)<br />* name servers of &quot;mydomain.de&quot; point to cloudflare (&quot;nslookup -type=ns mydomain.de&quot; =&gt; ray.ns.cloudflare.com, elle.ns.cloudflare.com), configured through the DNS interface of InternetX.<br />* name servers of &quot;external.mydomain.de&quot; pointing to HE (&quot;nslookup -type=ns external.mydomain.de&quot; =&gt; ns2.he.net), configured through the DNS interface of Cloudflare.</p><p>My internal domain handled by OpenWRT at home is &quot;internal.mydomain.de&quot;. There&#039;s no need to expose that to the outside world, so it&#039;s not added Cloudflare nor to HE nor to InternetX.</p><p>I really recommend to give both, Cloudflare and HE a try. Cludflare has a powerfull and shiny ajax based interface, HE adds dynamic DNS to your domains.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
