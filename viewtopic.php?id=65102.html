					<p>Hey there, so I got this device for like 2 hours and I bricked it.<br />I installed the device, I took a look at the gateway and I wanted to install OpenWrt, I installed the image from <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ramips/mt7620/openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-8M-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … actory.bin</a> and everything went pretty smoothly. </p><p>After messing around with the features of OpenWrt I decided to go back to the default firmware, this is where things start to go wrong.</p><p>I downloaded a firmware from the Nexx official website designed for WT3020A (<a href="http://www.nexx.com.cn/download/NEXX_3020A_V1.07_2014011618_upgrade.bin">http://www.nexx.com.cn/download/NEXX_30 … pgrade.bin</a>) and I flashed it with the help of this guide <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34277">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34277</a>. I don&#039;t know what I was thinking..<br />.<br />Then it never came back, the light stays on for ever and it has no gateway ip for me to access.<br />I tried to reset the device but it does not do anything, I kept it pressed for 2 minutes and it didn&#039;t do anything.<br />What can I do? Is it bricked for ever?<br />Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jaime29010</strong> on 25 May 2016, 16:40)</p>

					<p>Well, all going well, you will hopefully get a menu in the serial console and can choose to load an image via tftp.</p><p>Something like this <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/nexx/wt1520#installation">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/nexx/wt1520#installation</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 25 May 2016, 16:50)</p>
