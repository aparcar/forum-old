					<p>Nice work Andy.&nbsp; I now have your latest version running on my WZR-HP-G300NH with OpenWrt.&nbsp; I had to strip some INET6 stuff to get it to work on my IPv4 only OpenWrt build.&nbsp; Here are my usage notes:</p><p>AP name is always empty regardless if one is set from the command line or not. I get about one drop out per song which corresponds with &quot;missing frame.&quot; flooding the console.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have this issue with shairport.pl, but I haven&#039;t tested it head to head so it could just be a hairtunes issue (I was so excited about shairport.c that I left perl out of my build).&nbsp; The client in my case was an iPad.&nbsp; I also had some stutters that seemed to go away when I disconnected all other wireless clients from the AP, but the dropouts still occur.&nbsp; CPU usage during playback is about 40%.</p><p>Overall this seems to be a great start.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve seen the name not showing up in a few people&#039;s debug dumps.&nbsp; Sometime next week I&#039;ll be setting up a build environment for my openwrt stuff.&nbsp; Hopefully I can track down the issues then.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t make any changes to hairtunes, other than moving the main function around.&nbsp; So your droupouts may be due to the work people have been doing in that area of the code.</p><p>I would love it if more people jumped in and helped.&nbsp; Currently on my todo list:<br/>- debug iTunes client oddities.<br/>- don&#039;t leave child process orphans. (keep track of child pid&#039;s and catch signals)<br/>- Add more command line options / address feature gap between shairport.pl and shairport.c</p>									</div>
