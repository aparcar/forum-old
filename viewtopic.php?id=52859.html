					<p>I believe OpenWrt patches the kernel to use fq codel by default (see 662-use_fq_codel_by_default.patch). The qos-scripts uses both hfsc and codel if you look at the code.</p><p>I don&#039;t know the mechanics of these two, but if it works when configured correctly then why are you saying it doesn&#039;t work?</p>									</div>

The way to do this is too make sure your router does not send more data than the modem can transmit, so that the modem&#039;s buffers stay empty. This is what hfsc is used for. You probably knew that but just so we are on the same page...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So you probably noted that qos-scripts are more than a simple traffic shaper but allows multi-band priority management; but hfsc only makes sure that its different queues are serviced proportionally respecting the priorities, it will by itself not drop packets (I think, it probably does some sort of tail-drop of no other qdisc is attached). What this means is that if you only run hfsc on your router you most likely will still see 1000ms+ RTTs to google as hfsc does not control latency in any meaningful way. The fact that the latency is fine with proper shaping tells you that fq_codel world sort of.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You could try to ssh into the router and run &quot;tc -s qdisc&quot; that will give you statistics about the different queues, and then look at this on a quit link and while running a speed test.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Or you could hack the qos-scripts to replace fq_codel with pfifo_fast and watch your latency under load go out to lunch <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>

Now if fq_codel is in control of the bottleneck it can do its thing, that is control the delay in a &quot;fair&quot; manner. Now in your setup the real bottleneck most likely is located between the cable-modem and the cable modem termination system (CMTS). If you send traffic faster from your LAN than your modem can pass onto the CMTS, not-yet-sent packets will accumulate in the cable-modems buffers (which often are really large and take a long time to fully drain). If you could run fq_codel on the cable-modem all would be fine (and with the coming DOCSIS3.1 standard the modem will be a good bit better at controlling latency than it is right now). BUT today all you can do is send traffic slower to the cable-modem than the cable modem can push to the CMTS.
