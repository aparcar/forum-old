					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;d flashed openwrt over the latest Airos firmware (XM.v5.6.2.27929.150716.1201.bin).</p><p>Well I missed this from the wiki:<br />*Special Firmware Note: AirOS XM.v5.5.X images used U-Boot 1.1.4.2-s594 (Dec 5 2012 - 15:23:07). The OpenWRT image can be successfully flashed onto these versions of firmware. However, in July 2015 Ubiquiti released a new version of firmware XM.v6.X.X. With this firmware a new U-Boot version was released, U-Boot 1.1.4.2-s956 (Jun 10 2015 - 10:54:50). The newer U-Boot version changes the memory size and starting address for rootfs, cfg, and EEPROM. LOADING AN OPENWRT IMAGE ON A U-Boot 1.1.4.2-s956 WILL CAUSE THE DEVICE TO BE BRICKED!!! </p><p>I tried to flash back airos via TFTP but got bootloop. Previous AirOS versions got error when flashing.<br />DD-wrt does install but no telnet nor SSH also when rebooting everything goes to default.</p><p>Anyone with some help.<br />Thanks!<br />T</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TibeRiuSca</strong> on 5 Aug 2015, 00:47)</p>
