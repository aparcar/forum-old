					<p>Hi, I&#039;m a newbie here, but I&#039;ve got a WRT54GC I&#039;d like to see if I can get Linux on. I&#039;ve read the hardware wiki page for it, but it was slightly lacking, so I did a bit of digging.</p><p> I&#039;ve opened it up, and it appears to have both a Marvell processor and wireless chipset. From searching the Marvell site I&#039;ve found out that is is apparently the Libertas AP-52 reference design, only lacking some pin headers. The datasheet is here: <a href="http://www.marvell.com/files//products/wireless/Libertas_AP-52-RD.pdf">http://www.marvell.com/files//products/ … -52-RD.pdf</a>, and it appears that is <em>can</em> run uCLinux and eCos. Actually, I think the wireless chipset is an 88W8010 (the reference design says 88W8030), but I can&#039;t read it clearly enough. It&#039;s supposed to support a/b/g I think. The processor is a Libertas 88W8510H, which is supposed to be an ARM9 SoC with onboard memory. It&#039;s the same model as the processor in the WL-530G I think. It looks like that one has JTAG and Serial as shown here: <a href="http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/ow.asp?WL-530G#h14">http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase … L-530G#h14</a> so it seem that it has those capabilities. It does in fact only have 1MB Flash and 4MB memory (off chip). But what does &quot;-1x16 8 Mbit (1MB) FLASH (90ns or faster) with <strong>stuff option for up to 64Mbit</strong>&quot; mean? Could it potentially be upgraded? It also says that it has a &quot;-RS232 DTE interface&quot; but it&#039;s not obvious where it is located, or if it is even connected to anything.</p><p>Is there anything that can be done with 1MB of flash? Is there a version of OpenWRT that supports ARM9 that I could mess around with to try to cut the size down? Anyone have any idea where the RS232 could be found? I heard something about it not having an MMU, so that uCLinux must be used, but I&#039;m not sure. If that&#039;s the case, where should I start go to try that?</p><p>Thanks ahead of time.</p><p>EDIT: It just occurred to me that the Marvell pdf doesn&#039;t actually say that it was designed to run VxWorks, so it might already be running uCLinux. That would be kinda cool, if I could get to the serial connection.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>technik733</strong> on 20 Mar 2009, 18:55)</p>

					<p>hello there<br />I know, old thread, nobody replied, I might not even have it<br />Unboxed my unit, even removed heatsink from CPU&nbsp; &gt;&gt; 88W8510-BAN<br />there is an unused 2 x 8 pin connection at the bottom of the board (labelled 1 to 15) , which has lines going towards the CPU or toward some &quot;missing&quot; resistors around the CPU<br />I think , this is for JTAG or even maybe for serial connection<br />If a WL--530G uses same CPU and has JTAG+serial connection, would be interesting to take a close look, how it was done ( which CPU pins used?)<br />Then identify the pins+functions&nbsp; here and with some really good soldering skills , replace the missing resistors, and do some testing !</p>									</div>
