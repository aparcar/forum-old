					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;m looking for some guidance how to configure the above router. I have installed Kamikaze 8.09.2 from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2/brcm47xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2/brcm47xx/</a></p><p>At the moment I have an ADSL modem router on 192.168.0.1 with DHCP server and wish to use the WGT634U as a USB NAS, for now connected to the original network by ethernet.</p><p>The first bit of advice I need how to configure the router to act as _wired_ bridge to my existing network and give the WGT634U IP address from the existing network. This way I would be able to use the&nbsp; ports on the WGT634U to connect devices that get IP addresses the original network. at the moment the WGT634U is set up in the default config if the flashed image as a router - and I am unfamiliar with the configuration process. It seems to have two &quot;VLANs&quot; under Interfaces ( lan and wan ) and the switch section has two lines for those (0 1 2 3 4 5* and 4 5).</p><p>how could I configure the interfaces and switch so the WGT634U acts as a bridge? I couldn&#039;t find any doc in the wiki but if I am able to get it working, I will add the details to the wiki.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>You should move port 4 from vlan1 to vlan0, so all 5 ports will be one switch together. Leave vlan1 with port 5 in it.<br />Remove the WAN interface section, configure a LAN IP within your existing network with DNS and gateway set to your adsl modem router. Disable DHCP and firewall.<br />Alas, the WGT634U is rather slow, you will not get much more than about 1,3MBytes/sec. I don&#039;t know if you will be happy with that.</p>									</div>

Its helpful to have some kind of guidance than just trying random options as I was before! should this go in the wiki here: <a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/start">http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/start</a> or here: <a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/inbox/newswitchformat">http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/inbox/newswitchformat</a> ?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>MMCM wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Alas, the WGT634U is rather slow, you will not get much more than about 1,3MBytes/sec.

I used the rather nice Luci web interface to do the configuration. </p><p>About the wifi, do you think it would be possible to use the wifi as a bridge and client at the same time? I think if it is possible I could move the WGT634U+usb hdd to another room. At the same time I could use&nbsp; the switch on the WGT634U to connect the machines in that other room back to the original LAN (via the wifi bridge of the WGT634U). </p><p>I installed kmod-madwifi and configured it as just client to the existing wifi net but I could not connect back into the WGT634U web interface again, had to disable wifi and reconnect via lan. this wiki post seems to suggest it is not possible with the firmware I have: <a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient">http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient</a> any suggestion?</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p><p>[edited to fix typos and make it clearer]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>s_shah</strong> on 8 Feb 2010, 00:35)</p>
