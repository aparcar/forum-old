					<p>Hi there, </p><p>I have got as far as: </p><p>1) Setting up the guest wifi</p><p>2)Setting up a zone, setting up DHCP for it to ensure enough addresses and creating a firewall. </p><p>3) Configuring the firewall - i&#039;m stuck!</p><p>I&#039;ve set it up so that it forwards traffic to my LAN but I need to really forward traffic to a specific path - something like ht-tp://-192.168.1.110:80/filepath and then change that address back so that it looks like the original website for the purposes of phpbb working properly. </p><p>I can&#039;t see anywhere to forward to a specific url - would it be possible to also have any web address typed forward to this address - a bit like a public portal but without the hassle of setting up portal software? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Sam.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would try using some DNS-&#039;trick&#039; with dnsmasq.

					<p>Hi Augustus, </p><p>I&#039;m doing this as a charitable project for local residents so i&#039;m a bit out of my depth! A few questions from what you said:</p><p>1. How would I deploy this with dnsmasq please?</p><p>2. You used the address 192.158.x where did that come from - or is that just an example, did you mean the actual host address which is 192.168.1.110?</p><p>3. I presume this isn&#039;t possible within Luci? </p><p>4. How do I lock down the guest network so it can only go to the one website on the .110 install and nowhere else on the lan and also how do i stop guests accessing the wider internet? </p><p>Not a PHP Programmer so this makes me cry a bit :-p</p><p>Any help moving forward would be absolutely hugely appreciated. Many thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t see that it is outside of forum scope. I know it **is** possible in OpenWRT itself, i&#039;m just not advanced enough in openwrt to deploy a solution...In any event, a captive portal, itself, isn&#039;t going to do what I need as it won&#039;t have the advanced ability to ensure forwarding to the exact address. At best it would be overkill. This is likely firewalls or shell coding.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sammanchester</strong> on 28 Mar 2018, 15:49)</p>

					<p>Actually I was wrong - sorry about that. I was actually told that this was possible through custom firewall scripting this morning though. I&#039;ve settled on coovachilli but, as for how to set this up...no idea. I&#039;ve looked on youtube, that&#039;s just for installing on ubuntu, i don&#039;t really get how that&#039;s useful without the router side being explained, i&#039;ve looked on the web and read all sorts of conflicting information and i don&#039;t just want to type random stuff and then brick my router. I saw this help.hotspotsystem(.com)/knowledgebase/how-do-i-manually-configure-the-coovachilli-settings and wondered if it might work. OpenWRT Barrier Breaker 14.07 is what i&#039;m running. </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
