					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I have recently purchased a TP Link AC750 WiFi Extender. Details <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/RE200-Universal-Extender-function-Configuration/dp/B00KVD6CJY">http://www.amazon.co.uk/RE200-Universal â€¦ B00KVD6CJY</a> here. </p><p>I want to use it as an extender on my Archer C7 as the 5G network does not cover all of my house.</p><p>I logged into the extender at 192.168.0.254 so I changed the config to static ip 192.168.1.254, default gateway 192.168.1.1(Archer C7) and changed the DHCP to start assigning at 192.168.1.200 to 192.168.1.253 because my lan section on the C7 assigns IP&#039;s from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.199.</p><p>I connected the extender to the C7 wifi networks using the same SSID and passwords and the extender gui showed both networks as connected however I had nothing but problems i.e the device connected on the 5G channel would not sway over to the extender when I was standing right next to the extender about 30M away from the C7. The 2.4 light on the extender was green and the 5G light was green aswell.</p><p>Next I tried to go into the WiFi section on the C7 gui and changed the 2.4G C7 network to Access Point (WDS) in zone LAN.</p><p>I then performed a scan on the 2.4g channel and found the mac of the extender broadcasting the same ssid as the AP so I added it and changed the mode to Client(WDS) and created a zone WWAN. </p><p>This is what the wifi section then looked like and it seems to work great.</p><p>Generic MAC80211 802.11bgn (radio1)<br />Channel: 3 (2.422 GHz) | Bitrate: 135 Mbit/s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />85%SSID: 28_network_2.4G | Mode: Master<br />BSSID: EA:94:F6:C7:D2:2B | Encryption: WPA2 PSK (CCMP)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />75%SSID: 28_network_2.4G | Mode: Client<br />BSSID: 74:DA:38:12:8D:F9 | Encryption: WPA2 PSK (CCMP)</p><p>I then tried the same thing on the 5G channel and this is what happened </p><p>Generic MAC80211 802.11n (radio0)<br />Channel: 48 (5.240 GHz) | Bitrate: ? Mbit/s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />0%SSID: 28_Network_5G | Mode: Master<br />BSSID: E8:94:F6:C7:D2:2A | Encryption: WPA2 PSK (CCMP)<br />0%SSID: 28_network_5G | Mode: Client<br />BSSID: 74:DA:38:12:8D:F8 | Encryption: -</p><p>If I connect to the 5G I have no internet at all.</p><p>Does anyone know the correct way to set this up or have any advice. I have searched the Wikis and read about bridging etc but everything tends to talk about using another router as an extender and uses SHH codes, theres no Luci GUI tutorials.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tdbegley</strong> on 12 Feb 2015, 01:11)</p>
