					<p>Hi together.</p><p>Soon our goverment in germany will change our laws. After it will be no problem anymore to have an open wlan for guests/strangers.<br />The only &quot;rule&quot; will be, that i have to block people who did something wrong.</p><p>To create a second wlan i found this tutorial:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gu … binterface</a><br />Looks nice and easy to follow. But what makes me cunfused is, that i have to allow dhcp and dns, but never open port 80. Will the firewall automatic open every port?<br />For my self i would like to control it a little bit and just alow http, https. And is it possible to set a max connection count for an IP/MAC? I don`t want that someone use it for torrent/emule...</p><p>If i know a MAC did a misstake, how i can block this one?</p><p>Is it possible to config a load balanced between this wlan and my normal lan?<br />Like if I`m not at home the wlan can use 100% of my speed, but if i`m using my wan by my self only what will be left can have the guest wlan.</p><p>I hope someone already config a guest wlan like this and can me help/give tips how to do.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

At the moment if someone download a movie over your wlan, you as the owner have to pay in front of the curt. In the future it`s not my fault if someone else doing something bad, but if the curt get out who it was, then i need the possibility to block this user.<br />But of course, from the technical site its nonsense...</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>sera wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What you are looking for wrt. prioritizing your traffic is called QoS.</p></blockquote></div><p>If i google for it <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=openwrt+qos&amp;oq=openwrt+q&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.4657j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">https://www.google.de/search?q=openwrt+ … p;ie=UTF-8</a> i find different packages.

					<p>If you are new to qos I&#039;d go with what openwrt seems to recommend <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/qos">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/qos</a></p><p>All that blocking can be done by iptables. Add the required rules to /etc/firewall.user. source-mac and destiantion-port are the relevant options. &quot;man iptables&quot; contains all the glorious details. The luci firewall interface probably can greatly help in setting up rules.</p>									</div>
