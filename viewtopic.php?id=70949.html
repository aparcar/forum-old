					<p>Hello,</p><p>I installed OpenWRT on a Netgear R6250.<br />It is connected to a VM Superhub-2 which is in bridge/modem mode.</p><p>The router is not getting a WAN IP- much in contrast to the one it is replacing which has no problems. I compared the setting but all it should be is a dynamic DHCP lease without a default gateway to the ISP.<br />There are options to bridge this WAN adapter or define specific routes. Played around with all of them without luck.</p><p>Local LAN devices are connecting, just can&#039;t get a WAN IP.</p><p>Has anyone had any experience with VM on this?</p><p>Stephan</p>									</div>

The Superhub doesn&#039;t care abt MAC addresses in bridge mode.<br />VM had the hub&#039;s MAC registered and that hasn&#039;t changed. I never had to register anything behind the Superhub with VM. VM reaches as far as their device is concerned.</p><p>I wonder if there is anything in the WAN config that I need to be aware of.<br />Just looking for some ideas where to search. A bit in the dark right now...</p>									</div>

					<p>SOLVED:</p><p>This was simpler as expected but one has to find it:</p><p>There is a specific order in which one has to connect things.<br />The VM Netgear Superhub is very sensitive to changine hardware that is connected to it.<br />If a different device is connected (not really a client here as it is in bridge mode), it need to restart or it won&#039;t accept it.<br />So restart the Not-So-Super-hub and connect the new router and it will get an IP from the ISP.</p><p>What I found confusing on top of it (and I tried all opetions): On Interfaces -&gt; WAN -&gt; physical settings, the choice is: switch eth0; VLAN eth0.1/0.2; eth1/2; WLAN, custom. </p><p>Which is which? I got 4 slots plus 1x internet (which I assume is eth0 switch).<br />Eventually it worked on VLAN eth0.2 (WAN4/WAN6).</p><br /><p>Next issue is the very slow download speed on WLAN compared to the old DIR-615. But that&#039;ll be a different topic...</p><p>Stephan</p>									</div>
