					<p>I&#039;m confused, so many supportet devices and different versions of them... I need a small router/bridge capable to connect 2 or more Ethernet devices to an already existing wlan with an AP to replace a switch and a Linux Pc doing this job atm. This is an very old 11mbit solution which should be upgraded to 54mbit, Ap already supports 54mbit. I think Openwrt running on a small device would be perfect.</p><p>Which one is your favourite, fully supported and can be bought online without looking at the Version an stuff?</p><p>At my fav Vendor i came across the Buffalo WLA2-G54L, any good?</p>									</div>

					<p>For the best availble support the Linksys WRT54GL is a good bet.&nbsp; If you need a little more umph for things suchs a VPNs or room for extra apps go with the Linksys WRTSL54GS.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The Buffalo WLA2-G54L as you mentioned should work as well as long as the problems listed at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WLA2-G54L">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ /WLA2-G54L</a> aren&#039;t a problem for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortnately the Asus WL-500G deluxe is also EoL.&nbsp; It can be found from only a few remaining suppliers.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Seems like a constant chase for good cheap hardware these days for OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
