					<p>I run an asterisk server behind my openwrt router (bcrm-2.4), so I need to forward an UDP port to that server.&nbsp; Things work fine but after like a day or so my asterisk server no longer is connected to the outside world.&nbsp; Trying to figure out what&#039;s wrong I looked in the asterisk log.&nbsp; I can see it send the SIP request packet but it never receives any replies anymore.&nbsp; So I went into the openwrt, did an /etc/init.d/firewall restart, but that didn&#039;t help.&nbsp; Then I did an ifdown wan, and an ifup wan in hope that would fix the problem.&nbsp; Asterisk still doesn&#039;t receive any reply packets.&nbsp; The only solution that fixes this is to actually reboot the openwrt router.&nbsp; Supposedly there were some NAT fixes for bcrm-2.4 with 8.09.1 but it seems like there&#039;s still something broken.&nbsp; Has anyone noticed something similar?&nbsp; How can I fix this?</p>									</div>
