					<p>Hello.</p><p>The last two days I&#039;ve noticed that all traffic stops coming through and I have to reboot my router. I have ports such as 80, 20, 37, 443, 25, etc... open, but for the last two days they close up and I need to restart the router.</p><p>Aka I have to reboot my router so people can access my website, or I receive email.</p><p>What can I do to track down this problem? What trouble shooting steps can I take when this happens?</p><p>Also, as far as I know, I haven&#039;t changed any of the configuration settings on the router. I&#039;ve had kamikaze installed on it with my current configuration for the past month. Is this a sign the router might be going bad?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pyther</strong> on 4 May 2009, 00:05)</p>

					<p>Hmm... Thanks...</p><p>I tried that patch and compiled the image, but there was something wrong. The router would always reboot and it was in a fairly unusable state. Not sure if it was me installing xwrt, restoring my config, etc...</p><p>So I reinstalled the vanilla kamikaze I worked with luci which seems nice. I&#039;ll see what happens from this point.</p><p>Why would that issue just start affecting me now though?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pyther</strong> on 4 May 2009, 07:00)</p>
