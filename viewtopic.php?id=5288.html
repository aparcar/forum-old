					<p>no PANDA, that won&#039;t delete all the vars you don&#039;t NEED to use. It will delete the vars that aren&#039;t used by openwrt.</p><p>In most cases, it&#039;s better to delete the vars that you don&#039;t need to use and let the system defaults takeover. Just don&#039;t delete anything the system needs incase ure router cant recover from it.</p>									</div>

					<p>This topic has been answered too many times<br />- Use the cleanup script<br />- Do not fully erase nvram, you&#039;ll just cause more problems<br />- Erasing variables doesn&#039;t save any space</p><p>Search the forum. This topic is closed.</p>									</div>
