					<p>I was up until recently using Arokh&#039;s build of OpenWRT. I have now decided for a couple of reasons to go with my own image.<br />For the most part, I have included my own packages etc that i require, but the only things I haven&#039;t been able to do yet, is add the Overclock patch and the Reghack for Wifi.</p><p>I asked Arokh how he added it to his image, and his response was this:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>arokh wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>1. It&#039;s a kernel patch. It&#039;s in the top level directory and it&#039;s enabled through the CONFIG_KERNEL_OC_XXX options. (Patch located here: <a href="http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/stuff/">http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/stuff/</a> )<br />2. It&#039;s jow&#039;s reghack from <a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/">http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/</a> and I apply it before modules are loaded in package/base-files/files/etc/init.d/boot.</p></blockquote></div><p>I couldn&#039;t really piece it all together - I&#039;m a complete novice (or n00b) when it comes to building my own image.</p><p>I thought I better start a new thread to get this stuff resolved... Is anyone able to assist in pointing me in the right direction please?</p>									</div>

Instead of being a condescending douche maybe you could explain to me what you mean with a &quot;better solution&quot;?

					<p>Thanks for advice, but it didn&#039;t worked. I manually edited the boot file. After compiling and flashing the firmware, i found the .regd file in /etc/.</p><p>Is my reghack.mips.elf in the correct folder? I put it in </p><p>openwrt/trunk/package/kernel/mac80211/files/lib/wifi/reghack.mips.elf</p><p>I made it executeable. In the folder is already a file called mac80211.sh.</p><p>Is this correct?</p><p>greetings schnurzelat</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>schnurzelat</strong> on 13 Mar 2015, 09:47)</p>
