					<p>Good afternoon,</p><p>I&#039;m running White Russian RC3 and for a couple reasons cannot upgrade it quite yet. But I really need to start handing out IP info via DHCP (currently user machines have to hard code all of their IP info). I thought this would be quite simple to research and implement, but for the life of me I can&#039;t even find a starting point. Would someone mind explaining the obvious, or at least poing me in the correct direction.</p><p>Thanks,<br />festus</p>									</div>

					<p>All right, excellent site. But I&#039;m still missing something. If I put</p><p>dhcp-option=6,192.168.1.1 #(which is my wrt&#039;s inside address)</p><p>in dnsmasq.conf, then my DHCP clients do get that as their DSN server. But I don&#039;t get name resolution. Isn&#039;t dnsmasq supposed to forward that request to a real, recursive DNS server?</p><p>If I put</p><p>dhcp-option=6,12.213.80.61&nbsp; &nbsp;#(which is my current ISP&#039;s nameserver)</p><p>in dnsmasq.conf, then my clients get that and everything is fine. But what if my ISP changes their nameserver, or I change my ISP? I hook up to the net through various ISP&#039;s (work, home, on the road at campgrounds, hotels, etc...) and want whatever is in resolv.conf, which is dynamic, to be passed to clients. Isn&#039;t this possible?</p><p>Thanks,<br />festus</p>									</div>

					<p>How do you get dns from your ISP? DHCP, PPPoE? Make sure that /tmp/resolv.conf (which you specified in the dnsmasq conf file) contains the right server and that dns resolution works on the router. Then it should also work for your clients that have dnsmasq ip specified as the dns server.</p>									</div>

And yes, dns resolution works on the router. Is it possible that the routers firewall (configured with fwbuilder on a gentoo box) is blocking the router from forwarding these requests?</p><p>Thanks for helping,<br />festus</p>									</div>
