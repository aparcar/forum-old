					<p>It seems that the Wii does not play well with OpenWRT.&nbsp; Testing the connection in the Wii dash results in an &#039;Error code: 51330&#039;&nbsp; It is able to detect the broadcasted SSID, but does not connect.</p><p>I have moved the Wii to the same room as the wrt, adjusted the tx speed to 1.5mbps (wl0_rate=3,) as recommended on the Wii support pages, disabled all macfiltering, disabled all security (WEP,WPA, etc.)&nbsp; Still no dice.</p><p>I tried to run a tcpdump as suggested in #openwrt, but I see no traffic related to the wii at all when it is &#039;testing&#039; the connection.</p><p>I have also tried using dhcp, and manually setting connection info.</p><p>Relevant Wii Techsupport pages:</p><p><a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/customersupport/troubleshoot.do?error=51330&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">http://www.nintendowifi.com/customersup … =0&amp;y=0</a><br /><a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/customersupport/routerSelect.do?manufacturer=Linksys&amp;router=%2Frouters%2Fen%2FWRT54Gv5%2FWRT54Gv5.html">http://www.nintendowifi.com/customersup … 54Gv5.html</a></p><p>This is on a WRT54G v2, running RC5.</p><p>Any help would be apperciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>The Specs for the Wii list it as a .11b &amp; .11g compatable device, it is sort of frustrating that it will not operate at the actual speeds available to .11g.&nbsp; I also mentioned above that I had set my wl0_rate=3.&nbsp; I have since set it back to wl0_rate=0, and the Wii still functions properly.</p><p>If possible, can you check to see what your wl0_gmode is set to? if it is indeed set to 0, or 1 I think that would put more weight on this being the solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>Information above is incorrect.

ALso, that wouldn&#039;t explain why the WII can&#039;t even see the SSID...</p><p>any ideas where i should be looking? it happens after some 50~100+ connections.

					<p>Btw, i&#039;ve read in forums all kind of &quot;solutions&quot; for this. most require a modem restart... which is the real temporary fix <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>a friend of mine thinks he needs to change the DHCP start from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.100.1 and back every time this happens... go figure.</p><p>bottom line, i think yall safe to use G with the WII. B will give you the same problem in a while.</p>									</div>
