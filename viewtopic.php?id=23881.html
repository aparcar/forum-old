					<p>I wanted to create the system allowing me to develop drivers and applications for my Asus WL500gP V2 without continuous reflashing.<br />The system was supposed to consist of a small kernel+system flashed into the AP, and able only to mount<br />the USB disk, and then to boot another kernel from that disk and mount the rootfs from the disk.</p><p>A few people have reported success, but their description was not very detailed<br />(e.g. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=82587#p82587">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 587#p82587</a><br /> or <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21942">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21942</a>)</p><p>I have tried to utilize the patch mentioned in both above threads:<br /><a href="http://people.mandriva.com/~apatard/kexec_mips.patch">http://people.mandriva.com/~apatard/kexec_mips.patch</a>, described in <br /><a href="http://old.nabble.com/kexec-on-mips---anyone-has-it-working--td17485898.html#a22158033">http://old.nabble.com/kexec-on-mips---a … #a22158033</a>,<br />however it didn&#039;t applied cleanly to the kernel 2.6.32.9, used in the newest trunk.<br />After some investigations, I have found, that one modification from the above patch is sufficient<br />to get the kexec working in Asus WL500gP V2:<br />In file /arch/mips/kernel/machine_kexec.c<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>@@ -52,7 +73,9 @@ machine_kexec(struct kimage *image)
     reboot_code_buffer =
       (unsigned long)page_address(image-&gt;control_code_page);

+
     kexec_indirection_page =
         (unsigned long) phys_to_virt(image-&gt;head &amp; PAGE_MASK);</code></pre></div><p>I have compile the trunk with the above modification (of course I had also to select the kexec-tools <br />package in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; in &quot;Utilities&quot; section, and to enable the &quot;Kexec system call&quot; after<br /> &quot;make kernel_menuconfig&quot; in &quot;Kernel type&quot; section).<br />In fact for tests I have compiled the ramdisk image, so I had also to compile the USB and ext2fs<br />support into the kernel and to unselect as much other options (e.g. wireless, netfilter and others) to keep <br />the size of&nbsp; kernel+ramdisk below 4MB.</p><p>Therefore I was able to test my kexec-enabled image without reflashing, just from CFE:<br />CFE&gt; ifconfig eth0 -addr=172.17.1.6<br />CFE&gt; boot -elf 172.17.1.1:openwrt-brcm47xx-vmlinux.elf</p><p>After booting of such kernel I was able to mount the USB disk:<br />#mkdir /tmp/d ; mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/d<br />and boot the kernel from it:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># kexec --command-line=&quot;root=/dev/sda1 rootfstype=ext2 noinitrd console=ttyS0,115200&quot; -l vmlinux.elf
# kexec -e</code></pre></div><p>The kernel booted successfully, however it is not able yet to find the root file system on the USB disk.<br />Probably I need to compile the final image also with ramdisk, allowing the kernel to properly<br />initialize the USB storage.</p>									</div>
