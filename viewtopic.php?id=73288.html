					<p>I&#039;m a noob, forgive me. I write about:</p><p>wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</p><p>I&#039;ve done something strange to the router. I had access to Lede/LuCI at 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Trying to get that router ready for being used behind the modem, I changed the LAN IP to 192.168.1.11 (or some other number, maybe 0.1, yes I wrote it down, but it&#039;s NOT relevant to this post)</p><p>Now I cannot ssh back to root@192.168.1.11</p><p>I cannot access the devices Admin page at 192.168.1.11, or 192.168.1.1, etc.</p><p>Returning to the OpenWRT Failsafe page I see that there is no IP address given. Only instructions, after one can ssh into the device.</p><p>I think the authors have some implied understanding that noobies don&#039;t have. I think that page needs to be much plainer in the approach it take to showing the technology.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Step 1<br />Unplug the cable from the computer and connect it to the LAN &quot;Ethernet&quot; (often yellow in color) port.</p><p>Step 2<br />Reboot the router.</p><p>Step 3<br />Reboot the computer</p><p>Step 4<br />In a terminal, type:</p><p>ssh root@192.168.1.1</p><p>As you can see this is simpler.</p><p>Just my 2 cents.</p><p>URL as mess, the this Forum won&#039;t allow my first post ever to include a URL.</p>									</div>
