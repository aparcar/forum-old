					<p>Due to lots of problem with WiFi adapter on this device a decided to take a different approach. My idea is to buy a USB WiFi dongle and to use it as AP. I choose the following devices:</p><p>150Mbps<br />TL-WN722N This is a 150Mbps USB WiFi adapter with external antenna. <br />TL-WN721N like the previous one but without antenna. </p><p>300Mbps<br />TL-WN822N This is a 300Mbps USB WiFi adapter with external antenna.<br />TL-WN822N like the previous one but without antenna. <br />Revision 3 of this device can&#039;t be installed because uses Realtek&#039;s rtl8192cu driver. </p><p>Have anyone of you ever done such attempts to configure external usb wifi&nbsp; on TL-WR1043ND V1? </p><p>I&#039;m open to suggestions for other tested and working devices.</p>									</div>
