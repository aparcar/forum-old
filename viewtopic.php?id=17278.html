					<p>I am attempting to use the -P option in UCI to write config changes to a location other than /tmp/.uci/.&nbsp; However, in doing so, I have discovered that every UCI command works as I would expect with the notable exception of commit.&nbsp; Consider the following example:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# mkdir /tmp/.pmc
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# touch test
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# uci -P /tmp/.pmc/ set test.foo=bar
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# uci -P /tmp/.pmc/ set test.foo.name=sillytest
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# uci -P /tmp/.pmc/ changes
test.foo=bar
test.foo.name=sillytest
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# uci -P /tmp/.pmc/ export test
package &#039;test&#039;

config &#039;bar&#039; &#039;foo&#039;
option &#039;name&#039; &#039;sillytest&#039;

root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# uci -P /tmp/.pmc/ commit test
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# uci show test
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# uci -P /tmp/.pmc/ show test
test.foo=bar
test.foo.name=sillytest
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# cat test
root@OpenWrt:/etc/config#</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, the changes added to the /tmp/.pmc/test config change file never get committed.&nbsp; This is contrary to what I was expecting.&nbsp; Is this in fact a bug, or is -P meant for some other use?&nbsp; If it is not a bug, could you please explain why this behaviour is desired?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Michael</p>									</div>
