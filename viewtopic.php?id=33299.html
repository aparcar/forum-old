					<p>Hello, first of all I want to thank you for your great work.</p><p>Second, I have the following question:</p><p>I am using Backfire Release 10.03.1.-rc5 on my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND.</p><p>When I dont use Internet or LAN, I turn the power off my router and my DSL-modem off. When I power it up again, both devices boot up at the same time. However the modem takes some time until it is connected to the provider gateway. It seems that the router tries to build up the pppoe connection while the modem is booting up and connecting to the provider, which obviously cant work. Even though the pppoe-connection fails, the router seems to not try to build it up again (when the modem is connected).</p><p>So I think about configuring the router so that there is a delay for building up pppoe, or that he constantly tries it again (maybe after 1 minute) if theres no connection. But I dont know how to do this. Do you have any idea or solution to this? Thank you in advance.</p><br /><p>edit: maybe this topic should be moved to general discussion? Sorry</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HerrHansen</strong> on 3 Dec 2011, 18:58)</p>

					<p>Thank you, I will try this soon as possible.</p><p>If I understand it, this script will check constantly if my wan is up. Whether it is or it is not, it will execute something. As I really like to understand what I am doing, it would be so nice if you could explain what&#039;s happening with the ACTIONS.
