					<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>I have installed on my router DIR-300 A1 openWRT according these instructions: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300.</a> I didn&#039;t like &quot;slow-thinking&quot; web-gui of this firmware and tried to reflash to dd-wrt, but I can&#039;t telnet nor via 192.168.1.1 9000, nor via 192.168.20.81 9000, nor via 192.168.0.1 9000. I can&#039;t install new firmware from LUCI, I can&#039;t install it with ssh with command sysupgrade (in both cases router rebooting, and after reboot nothing changes, old firmware remaining). <br />So with mtd -r write openwrt-firmware.bin firmware, I getting some kind of error (I can write it later if need).</p><p>By the way I flashed last release <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/atheros/generic/,">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ /generic/,</a> maybe its not supported?</p><p>So how can I reflash it to dd-wrt for example, any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>It&#039;s my first post on this forum.</p><p>I have the same problem or almost the same.</p><p>I cannot do anything on my router but only via ssh. I cannot have even web configuration cause there is no space left.</p><p>So my questions is:</p><p>1.How do I install another firmware?<br />2.Can I temporary mount some other catalog from my Debian catalog? If so, how to do it without installing any other packages, cause I cant as Nea, cause there is no space left. Can I edit some preferences of opkg so when I do opkg update there is no space usage?<br />3.Can I put desired package like web configuration package for opkg via ssh, but not copy it, just install it directly without copying it, cause there is not so much space left?</p><p>I cannot access RedBoot when I do 5 second reset and telneting to it like before. I have partition with RedBoot but I can&#039;t access it. </p><p>1.How do I edit preferences of RedBoot from OpenWrt directly after router starts working and connected via ssh?<br />2.How do I reinstall RedBoot without using other RedBoot? Can I do this from console via ssh? And if so how I do it? How I install only RedBoot from OpenWrt via ssh?</p><p>Can I just format all data on the flash and put there on the free space one partition with RedBoot and begin installation entirely from scratch? </p><p>I tried to edit my IP address of my eth0 to 192.168.20.80 and I have tried to connect via telnet to 192.168.20.81 simultaneously having my cable connected to WAN port and having configured .telnetrc to:</p><p>cat .telnetrc <br />192.168.20.81<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mode line</p><p>and I cannot reach the RedBoot. I add that I have partition of RedBoot (its first partition) i checked it via dmesg.</p><p>I would appreciate any answers and I hope not only me but Nea too <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>2iwantopenwrt: Hey, you hinted me about ip address, and I tried telnet to 192.168.1.10:9000 instead 192.168.1.1:9000 and all worked for me!! (Dunno its wrong ip address a bug or feature, but if it is a feature, it should be on DIR-300 FAQ) I already have dd-wrt on my router instead this lagging openwrt. I couldn&#039;t reflash it for an half year <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, </p><p>The documentation is for professionals its helpful but not always for people who flashing for the first time. </p><p>I resolved my problem&nbsp; with tftp loading I couldn&#039;t remember the exact command but it should be enough hint for anybody who has the same problem. It was the IP problem, you should specify the IP address of your card and then it should work:</p><p>DD-WRT&gt; load -h 192.168.1.2 ap61.ram</p><p>and it works!</p>									</div>
