					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m doing some research on authentication/deauthentication on 802.11. I need to know where in the source code the authentication/deauthentication is handled. I&#039;m having an D-Link DIR-825 with AR922x NICs. After some investigation I found out something like <em>__cfg80211_send_deauth</em> in <em>backfire/build_dir/linux-ar71xx/linux-2.6.32.27/net/wireless/mlme.c</em> did some changes ther, but after I&#039;m building OpenWRT nothing happens, I&#039;ve seen that there is also a <em>backfire/build_dir/linux-ar71xx/compat-wireless-2011-06-22/</em> folder with some drivers source code, but I don&#039;t know which one exactly is for my NIC.</p><p>Can some one en-light me? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
