					<p>Folks</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get the DG834GT working in wireless client mode. I&#039;ve done the <a href="http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?todo=debug">http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?todo=debug</a> trick through the web server and started poking around at various promising candidates.</p><p>In /proc/net/ath there are a number of files - the two of most interest are ap_cli and ap_cfg.</p><p>echo {parameter} {value} &gt; /proc/net/ath/ap_cfg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will set a wireless setting<br />cat /proc/net/ath/ap_cli&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will print out the success / failure</p><p>You can get a list of all possible wireless settings from /etc/ath/ap_cfg.save</p><p>This seems to be the router&#039;s internal parameters as they&#039;re not very user friendly. On the other hand if you use ath_cli it is far more user friendly and do get / set from there.</p><p>echo help connect &gt; /proc/net/ath/ap_cli<br />cat /proc/net/ath/ap_cli&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will give you a list of all valid commands</p><p>echo get config &gt; /proc/net/ath/ap_cli<br />cat /proc/net/ath/ap_cli&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will give you the current status</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve set the operationmode variable to sta (wireless client) and joined a BSSID. Running a get status confirms this.</p><p>Unfortunately what the ap_cli utility is telling me isn&#039;t being implemented on the wireless interface itself. Whatever parameters I change makes no difference to the wlan0.</p><p>Does anybody know how I can get the wireless interface to implement my changes to the config?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried ifconfig the interface as well but it receives no packets.</p><p>Cheers,</p><br /><p>Paul.</p>									</div>

					<p>Use the ath_cli command (/usr/sbin/ath_cli) to manipulate the interface - it does work, but /usr/sbin/rc and its minions will reset it if the interface status changes too much.&nbsp; If you stop /usr/sbin/rc you lose the ADSL interface (which is nontrivial to do manually).</p><p>Any changes should be made in the nvram so that the apps that read it will find the change.&nbsp; The wifi_xxx ones are the main ones.</p><p>Note that the main atheros driver module (ath_ap_mips) may not in fact be capable of client mode, if its name is descriptive enough.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mmmm, I feared that the driver module might not be capable of running in client mode.</p><p>Does anybody know of another wireless router using the same atheros chipset capable of running client mode? If so we could try replacing the module.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>evanspa1</strong> on 1 Jun 2005, 23:51)</p>

					<p>The hardware is the same as a whole class of routers such as the USR9106 and Inventel Livebox.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same reference design with a different case &amp; slightly different firmware.</p><p>I was intending to get the source of all the devices that I could find to see what I could borrow, but never got around to it.</p><p>You might even be able to get madwifi to run on the box.. doesn&#039;t sound too impossible - IIRC there&#039;s a HAL for mips.&nbsp; The only issue might be the netgear kernel is heavily patched already... it took me a bit of tweaking to get jffs2 into it for example.</p>									</div>
