					<p>I&#039;d like to track how much time my kid is using the internet from any of his multitude of devices by setting up a dedicated router for him and tracking how much time the internet is enabled. My idea was to allow my kid to enable the internet himself by sending a ping to the router. Eg:</p><p>ping -i 60 -c 45 192.168.1.1</p><p>would enable the internet for 45 minutes (each ping would enable it for say 65 seconds). I figured an iptables rule to send ping requests to user space and a user space app to enable/disable internet access and keep a persistent counter of the number of minutes that the internet was enabled would work. Could this be easily done with OpenWrt or is there maybe already the equivalent functionality?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used OpenWrt before.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dave</p>									</div>
