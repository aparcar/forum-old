					<p>Just for the record: in case your media isn&#039;t HDD, you most likely don&#039;t _want_ this to be ext3, since ext3 has a lot higher write rates due to journalling (see media durability discussions in SSD circles, too). In case non-ext3 mount is impossible, then parameter commit=XXX might help a bit.</p>									</div>
