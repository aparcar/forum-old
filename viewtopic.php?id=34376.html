					<p>Hi, i&#039;ve bought a tl-mr3420 few months ago, last week i decided to install openwrt on the advice of a friend, but something went wrong!<br />I&#039;ve followed the procedure described there (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420</a>), i&#039;ve made a OEM easy installation. After the router reboot, i saw an interface (Luci), i logged in and i&#039;ve changed the default password with another one. Then i&#039;ve tryed to change the wan settings (such as gateway, ip address, dns...) but after pressing &quot;Save and apply&quot; the router did not answer anyway, or rather the page did not reload. Now, when i turn on my router the SYS led starts blinking for 30 seconds, then stops and stays on: the router does not seems to be reacheable from the PC (telnet, ping, ssh). Can anyone help me?<br />Sorry for my bad english <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>apeiron</strong> on 29 Jan 2012, 13:33)</p>

					<p>I have the MR-3220 and this happens to me all the time I try to activate WiFi. My way to talk to the Router again: <br />1. Try to start him in failsafe-mode. You&#039;ll find a description in the wiki, but for short: power off and when you give him power back you press the reset key like a machine-gun until booting has finished. Then the system link blinks rapidly and you can reach the router under 192.168.1.1 via ethernet and telnet.<br />2. When I managed to log in via telnet I run the command &quot;firstboot&quot;. This resets all the configuration files and I can start (after &quot;reboot -f&quot;) from the beginning.<br />Hth,<br />-mud-</p>									</div>

					<p>Generic failsafe works fine, keep toggling reset or any other button (if present) at a 1Hz rate while the unit is booting up, eventually the device becomes pingable at 192.168.1.1 and you can telnet in.<br />For this to work you must give your PC a static ip 192.168.1.2 with netmask 255.255.255.0</p>									</div>

					<p>Then it did not enter failsafe, keep trying. It is important that you press/release the button at a 1 per second rate, do not keep it pressed, do not try stupid 30/30/30 patterns.<br />Also attach to the lan port, in failsafe the current configuration is completely ignored.</p>									</div>

					<p>On the wan port i can ping successfully, but the other lan ports don&#039;t work. I&#039;ve made the failsafe in the way you explained me, second per second but it doesn&#039;t work. How can i recognize when the booting up phase starts?</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no failsafe for TL-MR3420 before <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/29661">r29661</a>.<br />Also most TP-LINK routers lack failsafe due to eth0 not accessible from any LAN ports <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8970">#8970</a>, there used to be a patch to bring up eth1 instead [s]<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6922">#6922</a>[/s] accessible from WAN port.</p><p>The CA-42 3.3 V serial to USB adapter is the only failsafe on any hardware: Recent reports for TL-MR3220 v1.2 notes a &quot;friendly&quot; serial header, that is Plug&#039;n&#039;play, no pull-up resistor anymore.</p>									</div>
