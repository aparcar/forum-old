					<p>I&#039;m running Kamikaze 7.09 on a WRTSL54GS. it&#039;s been working perfectly for a long time, but something happened yesterday. we had a bad thunderstorm, a lightning struck nearby (I think I even saw a flash of light and heard a zapping sound inside the apartment... weird).<br />since that moment, the connection between the router and the modem is down. everything else is fine - LAN, ssh, USB drive, etc.<br />also, if I hook up my laptop to the modem directly, it&#039;s working. it&#039;s not the cable connecting the router and modem, either.<br />can you think of a way to bring it to life again or at least make sure it&#039;s a hardware failure in the router?<br />thanks for your ideas!</p>									</div>

					<p>I lost the WAN port on a WRTSL54GS this summer too. I don&#039;t think you can revive it. Mine was connected to a terrestrial microwave link with a proper surge protector and a proper ground rod and still got fried. For the future, I might suggest you keep an old ethernet hub between your external gear and the router. That way you blow up something that costs less money.</p><p>Lightning protection is one of those tricky bits of electronics that separates the top notch companies from the rest. Even if the engineers design decent protection, the bean counters have to allow the extra $1 of production cost.</p>									</div>

					<p>Lost my spare WRTSL54GS in a similar storm, fried one of the main chips inside, total loss.&nbsp; Sounds like your WAN port is dead, probably not a lot you&#039;ll be able to do to get around that, I&#039;m afraid...</p>									</div>

					<p>as a minimum would try to reflash the firmware. Have seen flash contents damaged due to transients on the supply voltage and initialization may be imperfect.</p><p>What is wan and lan is programmable so you may still be able to use the unit by assigning the wan function to another ethernet port. Glue a dummy plug in the broken connector so you cannot forget that it is dead, if it is indeed.</p>									</div>

					<p>that would sound like a nice solution, but is it doable? according to the diagram on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS#head-90ef1bbb872b0506a9aaad459f26d8871f2f4102">this wiki page</a>, the wan port is wired separately.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>attila123456</strong> on 27 Aug 2008, 12:01)</p>
