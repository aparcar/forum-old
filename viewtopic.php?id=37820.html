					<p>It seems to me that as we move past the Linksys WRT platform, there will be a lot of these things lying around unused.&nbsp; Personally, when I finish transitioning to newer hardware, I&#039;ll have over a dozen sitting around.</p><p>I would like to re-purpose these units to act as wireless access points with a 4-port LAN switch.</p><p>I&#039;m new at OpenWRT, so I&#039;m still using the web interface.&nbsp; I got as far as making the WAN port and switch work the way I wanted, but wireless clients could only associate to the AP, not get DHCP or see the LAN.</p><p>Here is what I&#039;d like to do:<br />1) the WAN port should pull a DHCP address (so far I can only make this work with a static IP)<br />2) the 4 LAN ports should serve up access to the LAN<br />3) the WAP should serve up access to the LAN<br />4) no firewall, no routing, etc.</p><p>If anyone has ever done this, can you post the config file?</p><p>I don&#039;t know how to use the CLI yet, so any help is appreciated.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update:&nbsp; I got it all working except for DHCP on the WAN port.&nbsp; I was using DD-WRT, fyi.&nbsp; Once I get some time, I&#039;m gonna make this work with OpenWRT and post the config file.</p>									</div>
