					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I followed this tutorial step by step trying to get PIA working on a c7 router :</p><p><a href="https://www.robertkehoe.com/2015/08/setup-openvpn-using-openwrt/">https://www.robertkehoe.com/2015/08/set … g-openwrt/</a></p><p>My configuration windows looks exactly like these on the page but when I do the last step : &quot;25. Goto: Services -&gt; OpenVPN, check the Enabled checkbox beside our”pia_client”, then press the Start button, your VPN should now start up.&quot; It won&#039;t start. </p><p>Here the message I get in syslog :<br /> daemon.err openvpn(pia_client)[1978]: Options error: specify only one of --tls-server, --tls-client, or --secret</p><p>So what does that mean? Is this related to what the guys in the comments said (port problem?)</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks david for your reply.</p><p>I was able to figure things out. The last comment of this page made things work :</p><p>&quot;With the new CA file, you now need to specifiy the port under VPN settings (1198).<br />I also had to specify encryption (AES-128-CBC) and authentication (SHA1).<br />&quot;</p><p>I needed to add port option to change it to 1198. And I also had to add cipher and auth options.</p><p>Hope this will help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>b.bo</strong> on 1 Oct 2016, 14:34)</p>

					<p>I hope that would help. I&#039;ve tried a few VPN providers and PIA seems to be the most reliable out of the recommended cheaper ones, never had a problem with PIA, although I&#039;m not using their DNS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Indeed PIA is a a great VPN provider. The only annoying thing about PIA is the CAPTCHA page (One More Step) that appears more often that it used to be.</p><p>But unfortunately it still stops. I&#039;ll post later the syslog logs. It may help figuring this out.</p>									</div>
