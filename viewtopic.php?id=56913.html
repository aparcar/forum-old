					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;ve got one of these routers, and I&#039;m considering installing OpenWRT on it, as I hate the factory interface. This (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a>) page talks mostly about the C7, but I gather they are fairly similar. Is there anything I should be aware of, in terms of things that doesn&#039;t work etc, before flashing?</p><p>The main reasons I want to flash it, is to get the ability to ssh into it and run various standard Linux tools/packages, and to get a decent firewall. Also, how is performance? I&#039;ve got a 50mbps connection right now, but I&#039;m considering upgrading to 100mbps. I&#039;m not really worried about wireless performance, since I barely use it.</p><p>Do I use a cross-compile toolchain on one of my Linux boxes to build software for it? Where can I get that?</p><p>Any other advice?</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>You can download the toolchain from here:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ x/generic/</a></p><p>The SDK contains stuff to build OpenWrt packages (source that has been adapted for OpenWrt, and that ends up being packaged as an OpenWrt package). It contains the toolchain.</p><p>The toolchain can be used to compile C/C++programs that are not adapted for OpenWRT (like your own code).</p><p>I dont own the Archer C5 myself, but I think you should be just fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are precompiled versions as well, which is where I&#039;d start if you&#039;re just trying it out. </p><p>Performance-wise, 50mbps is probably no problem, even with shaping/QoS turned on. There is a thread elsewhere here about peak performance and I can&#039;t remember if it can hit 100mbps. It&#039;ll be close and probably not get there with shaping/QoS turned on. Unfortunately, there are not a whole lot of options that are significantly faster.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 19 Apr 2015, 21:46)</p>

					<p>Thank you both for your replies! I&#039;m preparing to flash right now, but I just wanted to ask how stable the recent snapshots are? There seems to be a little patching and fixes required for this router with Barrier Breaker, that are fixed in later snapshots, so I&#039;m considering just using that.</p><p>I do understand that it is under development, but I&#039;m running development releases on all my Linux boxes anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Also, in dd-wrt you can choose between &lt;country&gt; and &lt;country&gt;-BFWA as regulatory domain - does OpenWRT also have this? What&#039;s the difference?</p>									</div>

					<p>Snapshots are pretty stable right now, but keep in mind that they don&#039;t include a web GUI by default. You&#039;ll have to install that manually (see Luci entry in the wiki). Also keep in mind that any packages you want to install need to come from the same nightly build (more or less). So download firmware, flash firmware, and install any packages in one sitting.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 20 Apr 2015, 16:19)</p>

					<p>OK, thanks. I installed Gargoyle yesterday to have a look at it, since I got the impression it was the best of both worlds, but I was wrong <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Can I just flash the latest snapshot of OpenWRT on top of it, or do I need to do some other magic?</p><p>EDIT: That is to say, do I just download the sysupgrade image I want and flash that?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fenris</strong> on 21 Apr 2015, 14:53)</p>

					<p>Yes you can flash openwrt over gargoyle using sysupgrade. Be sure to reset to defaults.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure I would call it an issue, but there are a couple of things that are not supported in Barrier Breaker (and hence&nbsp; Gargoyle) on the C5 and C7, and there are other things that can&#039;t be configured through the webui that I want. All in all, I figured I would be better off with a snapshot of CC. Don&#039;t get me wrong, though, Gargoyle is fine,&nbsp; and a lot better than the default firmware, it simply misses a few things I need.</p>									</div>

					<p>May need to install ath10k and/or enable/configure it to get 5 GHz working on gargoyle, if they didn&#039;t include it for some reason. I&#039;d just stick to OpenWrt, especially with a kinda sorta bleeding edge device like yours.</p>									</div>
