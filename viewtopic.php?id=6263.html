					<p>Is this still applicable?&nbsp; The documentation is very confusing.&nbsp; First it states explicitly that WRT54Gv5 onward is not supported, then the docs make lots of references to working with v5.&nbsp; So rather than &quot;just doing it&quot; and risk bricking my router, can I run WhiteRussion 0.9 on the v5 or maybe I can back off to a prior release?&nbsp; I&#039;ve played with DD-WRT but the micro version is too butchered to be useful to me without customizing it.</p><p>All I want to do is bridge the WAN and LAN/WLAN and have the WAN side get DHCP.&nbsp; Everything else just passes through the WAN&lt;--&gt;LAN/WLAN.</p><p>Any guidance would be most appreciated.</p>									</div>
