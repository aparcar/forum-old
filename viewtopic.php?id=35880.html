					<p>Hi,</p><p>i&#039;ve attached a few scripts to the reset button on my router, which should get executed on the basis of how long i press the button. But this doesn&#039;t work. Only the first script, which is configured to be executed when i press the button between 0 and 3 seconds, gets executed all the time. The other scripts doesn&#039;t get executed.<br />So i inserted the line &quot;logger seen is &quot;$SEEN&quot;&quot; in the /etc/hotplug.d/button/00-button script which gets executed when a button press oder release event is triggered to see what&#039;s the value of $SEEN. The value of $SEEN is all the time 0, so thats the cause why all the time only script 1 is executed.</p><p>Has anyone an idea why $SEEN gets set incorrect or maybe doens&#039;t get set? Or where $SEEN gets set or rather from which program or script?</p><p>My button config in /etc/config/system looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;button&#039;
        option &#039;button&#039; &#039;reset&#039;
        option &#039;action&#039; &#039;released&#039;
        option &#039;handler&#039; &#039;/usr/local/script1&#039;&#039;
        option &#039;min&#039; &#039;0&#039;
        option &#039;max&#039; &#039;2&#039;

config &#039;button&#039;
        option &#039;button&#039; &#039;reset&#039;
        option &#039;action&#039; &#039;released&#039;
        option &#039;handler&#039; &#039;/usr/local/script2&#039;
        option &#039;min&#039; &#039;4&#039;
        option &#039;max&#039; &#039;7&#039;

config &#039;button&#039;
        option &#039;button&#039; &#039;reset&#039;
        option &#039;action&#039; &#039;released&#039;

        option &#039;max&#039; &#039;30&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The /etc/hotplug.d/button/00-button file/script is the standard file/script, which was there from installation on. I&#039;ve nothing changed within the file or any other hotplug stuff.</p><p>I&#039;m running openwrt backfire branch r31074 with kernel 2.6.32.33 on a fonera+ (aka fon2201), which is AR231 based.<br />I hope this helps.</p>									</div>
