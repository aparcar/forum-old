					<p>I&#039;ve added support for XScale (ARM v5T), and it&#039;s almost complete (need to clean up the ixp4xx library and add it), so the toolchain support is already there. If someone wants to donate a Peplink, I would be happy to support those as well (and port 2.6 to them), and of course we are happy to accept patches.</p>									</div>

					<p>Want to build kamikaze for Cirrus EP9315 board (ARM920).<br />Cirrus have it&#039;s own distro based on 2.6.8 kernel, gcc-3.4.3 toolchain and uclibc 0.9, but without any packaging system. It just have several tgz and script to build everything-at-once.</p><p>So I want to use same distro (OpenWRT) on Asus&#039;es and EP9315 devices. Also I want to use own Cirrus kernel with OpenWRT.<br />How can I do it ?</p>									</div>
