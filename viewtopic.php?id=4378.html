					<p>I just got this amazing router from LinkSys and I&#039;m curious if it will work. It appears to be in the same family with the WRT54G and the WRT54GL which are compatible with FON.</p><p>Here&#039;s the link to all the Specs on Linksys.com. <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1138056788757&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellit … torWrapper</a></p><p>I checked <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a>:<br />The router was not on the list, however all the screen shots suggest to me the router has a very similar firmware. The only difference is the linksys routers listed are DSL, while the one I have is Cable. I&#039;m curious that maybe the router is new and the list hasn&#039;t been updated yet. Is there a reason no LinkSys Cable Modem/Routers aren&#039;t listed?</p>									</div>

					<p>Your best bets are units that are Linux to start with. Preferably ones listed on the GPL page here:</p><p><a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416836002&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellit … torWrapper</a></p><p>You could also download the firmware .bin file and dig through it and see what it contains. Linux or other?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 8 Feb 2006, 19:52)</p>

					<p>I got my hands on one of these half a year ago (I&#039;m telling this because I don&#039;t know if there is a newer revision). That one used a BCM93348 chip, which is a 200MHz MIPS32 core with a DOCSIS 2.0-certified cablemodem, and as far as I could guess, VxWorks - I was unable to hook up a serial console to it due to lack of time.</p><p>My opinion is that even if you could pass through the bootloader, hack together a kernel that boots up, you would be unable to use the cablemodem device, which is the main feature of this router. Same applies to all cablemodems out there, I haven&#039;t seen a Linux-compatible cablemodem chip, and due to the high price that a DOCSIS certification costs, I doubt there ever will be.</p><p>(BTW, the look of the web interface should never deceive you, it&#039;s the smallest thing of the whole that makes a router work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> )</p>									</div>
