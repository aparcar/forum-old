					<p>Hey, i have the exact same problem here. I&#039;m new to all this (however i have a background in electronics and have been using linux for a few years). I&#039;m having trouble with the column &quot;versions&quot; in the TOH. From what I&#039;ve read, this refers to the hardware version of the router.

Any recommendations regarding that?</p><p>EDIT: oh, and how big are the changes between firmware versions? i&#039;ve come across some routers that only support fw 14.07.

What can be a security problem is for example openssl library which is updated for both version. And another note - the 14.07 that you&#039;ve read is probably the first final version it was introduced into openwrt. 15.05 (Chaos Calmer) most probably supports it too!</p><p>Still to receive a concrete answer you need to give us your hardware requirements.</p>									</div>

					<p>@t3hn00b: Thanks for clarification!</p><p>Okay, so my hw-requirements are as follows:<br />- wifi router, for &lt;= 50€ in costs<br />- working with a recent version of openwrt (luci-interface would be nice, but not necessary)<br />- detachable antenna<br />- dsl, wifi, ethernet, usb-port<br />- optionally both 2.4/5GHz band</p><p>Surely, the more features the better..but I guess it&#039;s more about the costs atm, so if there&#039;s something for 30€, even better</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mockinbird</strong> on 12 Dec 2015, 15:16)</p>
