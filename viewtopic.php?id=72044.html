					<p>You cannot &quot;define interfaces&quot; in OpenWRT. The section name is called &#039;config interface&#039; in /etc/config/network, but what it really does is declare <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#interfaces">a logical network</a>.</p><p>In order to accomplish what you want, you&#039;d need to either purchase additional network interface card(s) (e.g. USB-to-Ethernet adapter(s)) or resort to creating virtual adapters using existing hardware.</p><p>If you choose the latter option, then VLANs is probably the most effective way to achieve what you want.</p><p>You can also tackle the problem by creating a VPN server that is connected to &#039;lan1&#039;, and running a VPN client that connects to this server (which resides in the same router). The VPN client would then act as &#039;wan2&#039; for the &#039;lan2&#039; network. However, I think this kind of an approach would be a complete overkill.</p>									</div>
