					<p>1. rTorrent/CTorrent/Transmission. IMO the best Linux BitTorrent client is still rTorrent.<br />2. Wget :-)<br />3. Of course, but I don&#039;t use, so you have to find something.<br />4. Samba/NFS<br />5. You can edit fstab and add auto-mount HDD whet router reboot. Most software you have to configure, but you can find many HowTo&#039;s/FAQ&#039;s how to do it. And you even don&#039;t need web interface. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> But if you want you can install LuCI on HDD as a package.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KeFaS</strong> on 11 Mar 2009, 04:07)</p>

					<p>Hello</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I think what has been mentioned is that the latest versions (8.**) won&#039;t work without serious modification for the WL700gE.</p><p>joop3: If possible, perhaps we can work this out, and create a pre-compiled version that can be &#039;released&#039; to the public.
