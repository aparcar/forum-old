The good news is that this &quot;no&quot; may be a &quot;not yet&quot; - Seems that there is enough knowledge and/or source code to eventually support it, <em>however</em> it is still very far away from actually being mainline. Devs are close to a PoC (i.e. working with a really old OpenWRT release and with a custom-patched hostapd) but even when they get there there&#039;s a long way from PoC to production.<br />Do remember that these are just volunteers. Working in RnD myself, I can tell you that after 5 days of this I usually can&#039;t bring myself to looking at source code on weekends as well, no matter how interesting it is. If you were to pay them their monthly salaries and have them do nothing but this for a while it could probably be done within a few weeks or so but I doubt that you&#039;re willing to pay thousands of $$$$ just to have 5GHz on your LEDE router. Just let them take their time and see how this unrolls.</p><p>With that being said - Mandrake, lpm11, blackladder1000 - I can&#039;t seem to understand which kernel version you&#039;re currently working on. Could you please summarize so I can also take a look?</p>									</div>

					<p>@NiQ<br />I&#039;m running OpenWRT with kernel version 4.4.14.<br />It&#039;s Designated Driver 50108 which relates to git-17.227.62661-3d338ee<br />When I built my build environment I pulled the latest git for OpenWRT</p><p>As detailed throughout this thread, I can get WAVE300 sources to compile and instatiate successfully.<br />lpm11 helpfully provided a script to port /etc/config/wireless settings to the WAVE300 hardware.<br />As a result, I can successfully bring an access point up and can connect to it from another device (my phone - with a static IP).</p><p>However, the final part that I haven&#039;t solved is passing traffic through the interface.</p><p>lmp11&#039;s script calls mtlk-ap, which is a modified version of hostapd. In a previous post I modified a current version of hostapd to support mtlk hardware. Alternatively, the WAVE300 sources include hostapd 0.8 with the neccessary modifications. Unfortunately, at present, neither my version nor the driver version allow me to pass traffic.</p><p>Most recently, lpm11 and Mandrake helpfully suggested hostapd/mtlk-ap settings. Unfortunately I still haven&#039;t managed to get traffic to pass - even with their recommendations. I&#039;ve also recently started a new job so have had little time to continue debugging. I will return to it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello you guys,</p><p>I think you are doing a great job and it is very much appreciated.<br />@Ipm11<br />Au contraire<br />There are literally bootloads of these devices out there, because they are cheap and perform well.<br />There are hundreds on ebay of the TP-Link 8980 alone and there are 3 other variations of this model all with the wave300 chipset.<br />These things work so well even without the additional 5GHz band that I got another 2 of them for about 20â‚¬ each to expand my wifi coverage on my property.<br />I mean it is just Wi-Fi N, but 300Mbps on a mobile device?<br />Certainly can&#039;t complain about that for 20/30 bucks.<br />Also these devices are only sold with aDSL vDSL modems @50Mbps max, but with another vDSL firmware I got mine to support vectoring&nbsp; at 150Mbps.<br />These are such a great deal.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I have been unable to follow up with this issue too much, but I have been reflecting on it.<br />I found 2 bugs within the up-porting of nlmsgs.c which led to certain cases of the netlink layer not being properly initialized, hence the panic I&#039;ve been getting on mtlk_nl_send_brd_msg() possibly because nl_sock was undefined.</p><p>This also explains why it worked for blackadder1000 on kernel 4.4 ( the ifdef passed for kernel under 4.5). I switched it for greater than kernel 3.2, so I believe it should work for kernels greater than 4.5 as well now. I am using the latest lede-trunk.</p><p>I have pushed this modification to my repo <a href="https://github.com/vittorio88/WAVE300/tree/Dual-license-BSD_GPL.">https://github.com/vittorio88/WAVE300/t â€¦ e-BSD_GPL.</a> I am now up to the point where blackadder1000 was a while back where the wifi will connect, but there is no IP connectivity. Above all, the router doesn&#039;t crash!</p><p>I hope this can help bring us all to the same page.</p><p>These are the commands I am using to set up the connection:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>insmod mtlkroot.ko cdebug=2

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Sorry blackadder1000, but I have been busy, and had a few gaps in my knowledge with regards on how to proceed.<br />Your information was very helpful.</p><p>I am not too sure, but I believe that using hostapd, wpa_supplicant, /lib/functions.sh, /etc/network/config may be jumping the gun a little bit. I think that until we can ping through wireless connection without those utilities, we should focus on possible driver issues. </p><p>I would be grateful if anybody could correct me, but I believe that the minimum required to ping through a wireless link on linux are:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iwpriv wlan0 sCountry IT
iwconfig wlan0 essid test-24ghz
iwconfig wlan0 channel 1
ifconfig wlan0 up
ifconfig wlan0 192.168.80.1

# connect from remote computer
# set static ip 192.168.80.2 on remote computer
ping 192.168.80.1</code></pre></div><p>With this configuration, ping should be possible without hostapd on an open network to the best of my knowledge.</p><p>This brings me back to the driver. I have worked on it to render it more easy to build. The latest version is available at:<br /><a href="https://github.com/vittorio88/WAVE300">https://github.com/vittorio88/WAVE300</a> with step-by-step build instructions starting from scratch.</p><p>From the output of ifconfig, it seems no packets are getting to the linux IP stack, they get dropped on TX and nothing comes on RX:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ifconfig
wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:09:86:00:00:00
          inet addr:192.168.80.1  Bcast:192.168.80.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:9452  Invalid misc:4366   Missed beacon:0</code></pre></div><br /><p>To me this means that something between the driver and the IP packet stack of linux is broken. The channel for configuration, however does work adequately, as iwconfig works perfectly. To communicate between iwconfig and the MTLK driver, it seems that IOCTLs are used for pretty much everything for configuration of the HW.</p><p>A lot of the work in making the driver run on newer kernels had to do with up-porting netlink and procfs, so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the problem was there.</p><p>It is probably not a procfs issue because the procfs files /proc/net/wireless and /proc/net/dev seem to be fine.<br />(There are issues deinitializing the procfs which lead to backtrace upon on rmmod of mtlk.ko), but it seems to cause no harm.</p><p>This leads me to think the netlink porting is the culprit of the non-functioning driver.<br />Reading the code, I find the following snippet:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>int mtlk_nl_init(void)
{
  /* netlink groups that are expected:
   * 1 - is joined by hostapd, wpa_supplicant and drvhlpr
   * 2 - is joined by wsccmd (Simple Config)
   * 3 - is joined by IRB media
   * so, total number of 3 groups must be told to kernel
   * when creating socket
   */</code></pre></div><p>So from what I understand, in addition to using iwconfig and IOCTLs;&nbsp; hostapd, wpa_supplicant and drvhlpr also can configure the MTLK driver through netlink groups. <br />Unfortunately I do not know what groups 2 and 3 are (wsccmd and IRB media). If anybody knows the answer there I would be very grateful!<br />If those netlink groups (2 and 3) could be the ones used to send packets through the kernel from driver to IP stack, then it is very likely that this is where the driver is broken.</p><p>Netlink being broken would also explain hostapd not working.</p><p>Anyway, I hope someone here knows the answer, because I would very much like to get this WiFi working before the whole router is completely obsolete <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>- Vittorio</p>									</div>
