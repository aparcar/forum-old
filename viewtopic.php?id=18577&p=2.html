					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;ve been trying to get my intel 4965 agn connect to a N network on a AR9160 AP, built with a mikrotik router board equipped with a ubiquiti minipci card. I&#039;ve exactly the same issues you report, including the &quot;security mismatch...&quot; error, after I tried many different combination of settings on both client and server side. I&#039;m also using the very last version of compat-wireless packages under debian, 2.6.28-2 snapshot kernel.<br />I also contacted the support of intel but they didn&#039;t provide any useful hint, a part changing the access point. As I do not want to spend more money buying another card for my client side, I can&#039;t really say if the problem resides on the server or on the client, or on both. By the way, it&#039;s working perfectly with G and A protocols, without any issue, on both linux and windows.<br />A question, which broadcom card have you on your lap?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>simone78</strong> on 1 Mar 2009, 22:43)</p>

					<p>Wow!&nbsp; I&#039;ve added linuxb&#039;s wme* settings and finally got 802.11n connection from both Intel cards!<br />Don&#039;t know why, but it definetely solves the &quot;security mismatch&quot; problem.<br />With &quot;ht_capab=[HT40-][SHORT-GI-40]&quot; config I get 300mbps rate, and 130mbps without it.</p><p>However, it still doesn&#039;t not work right. Connection is almost bad in N mode. Ping shows 50-90% packet loss, every second or third packet is lost. Download speed is usually only some kBps. Sometimes it improves and seems to work well and I have ~2 MBytes/s speed, but it only lasts some minutes. <br />Situation is the same with both Intel cards, different ht_capab configs and bands. Also it doesn&#039;t depend from connection speed, signal stregth or distance from to the router.</p><p>Broadcom card still works well with these settings. I have 270 mbps in 5Ghz band and 130mbps in 2.4 band. Transfer speed is 2.4 MBytes/s limited by CPU load.</p>									</div>
