					<p>I opened the case up and was working through serial with the bootloader, and made a trial (many routers have this, its just a question of how to get it).&nbsp; Watching the serial output, it actually counts the time the reset is held, and so I just waited, and saw that the router went into recovery, and it gave me the details about the file and where the IP for the server.&nbsp; Then I checked to be sure that flashing the GL-inet version would work and it did.&nbsp; Hope it helps others.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I was able to tftp the new kernel to the device and then it starts asking for the rootfs file so I reboot, but unfortunately it does not come back up with openwrt. I have tftp&#039;d with both linux and windows. I have waited 2 + hours after uploading the kernel before rebooting to make sure I have waited long enough for the write to finish.

					<p>I hope there is still life in this thread. </p><p>I update my Tripmate HT-TM06 with OpenWRT..<br />Did it to see what it looks like since there were no screen shots of menus or layout posted anywhere on here.</p><p>So looks cool, but seems a sacrifice to many standard features that the device was made for when using their original interface. Is it possible to run original software from Hootoo as before with OpenWRT at same time?</p><p>Since I am &quot;in&quot; now, is there a method so future firmwares from HooToo do not look us out?</p><p>If not, how to flash it back back to factory?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wilsonb</strong> on 22 May 2017, 04:36)</p>
