					<p>Hi,<br />I have a bunch of 30 Linksys wrt54gl all of them with its original firmware, apart of them I have a wrt54gl already configured with openwrt whiterussian (wpa2-radius, xrelayd, some iptables rules, etc.) I want to clone configuration and packages on the rest of wireless routers. What method of cloning do you recommend me?</p><p>For example I&#039;ve read this post:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=52592">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=52592</a></p><p>Can I use it on wrt54gl? Is not risk of bricking the routers. In <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/BackupAndRestore?highlight=%28backup%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/BackupAndRestor â€¦ 8backup%29</a> I can read:<br />&quot;WARNING: Restore the NVRAM partition only on the same Wrt router where you did the backup! Restoring the NVRAM partition can brick your router.&quot;</p><p>what does mean&nbsp; &quot;same wrt router&quot;, same model?, or exactly the same device?</p><p>Thanks in advance!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sebelk</strong> on 26 Feb 2008, 13:02)</p>

					<p>What I would do is this:</p><p>Get a list of packages installed on the router you want to clone:</p><p>ipkg list_installed</p><p>Get a list of the directories in / on the router.&nbsp; Ignore rom, tmp, proc (and on a 2.6 kernel you would ignore sys too).&nbsp; Then copy them to a PC:</p><p>From the PC:<br />mkdir source<br />cd source<br />ssh routerIP &#039;cd / &amp;&amp; tar cf - /etc /bin /sbin /usr ...&#039; | tar xvf -<br />cd ..</p><p>Then do flash White Russian onto a new router, including any packages that are installed on the source router.&nbsp; Then dump the files from the new router too:<br />mkdir base<br />cd base<br />ssh routerIP &#039;cd / &amp;&amp; tar cf - ...&#039; | tar xvf -<br />cd ..</p><p>Then you can compare the two to see what files have changed.</p><p>Then you will need to see what nvram settings to change, so dump the nvram on both routers too and compare them.&nbsp; Also, dump the nvram on a few other routers because I have found that the nvram on two out-of-the-box routers can be very different.&nbsp; From the nvram dumps, try to figure out what settings are actually necessary for your purposes.</p><p>Then make the necessary filesystem and nvram changes on the new router that you installed White Russian onto and make sure everything works as expected.&nbsp; If something doesn&#039;t work, figure out what needs to change and update your list of nvram settings or whatever accordingly.</p><p>If changes to files are necessary, you can just create a tarball of the necessary files and call it fs-changes.tar.&nbsp; Note, the files in the tarball should be owned by root or some things may not work (e.g. crontabs AFAIK).</p><p>When everything is OK on the second router, write a script which does something like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

ipkg update
ipkg install package1 package2 package3

nvram set something
nvram set something_else
nvram commit

cd /tmp
wget http://PC/fs-changes.tar
cd /
tar xvf /tmp/fs-changes.tar</code></pre></div><p>Then the flashing of new routers will not be a single step, but will still be quite simple:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Flash White Russian
$ telnet routerIP
OpenWrt# cd /tmp
OpenWrt# wget http://PC/configure.sh
OpenWrt# sh configure.sh
OpenWrt# reboot</code></pre></div>									</div>
