					<p>Hi,</p><p>i am configuring my home router ASUS N18U with Tomato by Shibby FW. I would like to set up a home webserver NGINX on it. I know, it is not ideal. The only problem I have is that I cant access the server from Wan. Moreover I have dynamic IP, which I have resolved with DDNS Service. It works fine, if I want to access config page of router or SFTP or when I type myddnsdomain and I am inside LAN. I opened port 80 on my modem(from ISP) and add the code below to routers(ASUS N18U) config, I cannot just port forward it in admin menu, because it allows forward only to lan(my web server is on &quot;router&quot;).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>None of those codes solved my problem. I have also tried different ports. I tracerouted it and it seems, that router blocks it. Accessing my server through Wan IP have not helped. Folder &quot;www&quot; is owned by nobody. Thank you for your help</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># NGinX generated config file

					<p>Your LAN, and most especially the WebGUI, should never be directly accessible from WAN.</p><p>Accessing the WebGUI should always be done utilizing HTTPS (generally port 443), not HTTP (port 80 or 8080).&nbsp; Before setting up a WAN accessible web server, you really need to do some research about how to do so securely.&nbsp; Your Nginx config is not secure and if you provide WAN access to your LAN without properly securing the access points, you will most likely be exploited in under 24 hours (thousands of connections from WAN are rejected every day by the average router firewall).&nbsp; </p><p>IP Sec isn&#039;t something you want to skimp on... utilize google, read up on how to configure a setup properly, ensure you fully understand what you&#039;ve read and what each line of each config you need does, finally test, then implement.&nbsp; </p><p>If you&#039;re simply looking to have access to your home LAN or external storage connected to the router, configure an OpenVPN server on the router (here&#039;s a <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openvpn-streamlined-server-setup">wiki</a> I wrote that walks you through how to do so); or if you simply want to access the WebGUI from WAN, configure SSH, which will allow you to securely access the WebGUI via the SSH tunnel.</p>									</div>
