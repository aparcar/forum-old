					<p>Good day</p><p>Newbie here. Having a hard time finding the right term to use in searching posts related to my issue.</p><br /><p>I got a TL-WR941N and I flashed Barrier Breaker 14.07. It was successful. Now I&#039;m trying to it up to be a wireless bridge (repeater).</p><p>Problem is, when I click on WiFi and then click Join Network, nothing shows up. Putting it beside the main router doesn&#039;t help.</p><p>I tried to setup manually (not through terminal command, not familiar with it yet) and I still can&#039;t get it to connect.</p><p>One thing I noticed is, under Interface, I&#039;m not seeing a wwan (which I see in some youtube tutorials). Tried setting one but it&#039;s asking form something I don&#039;t understand hence I can&#039;t create a wwan interface.</p><p>Any help is welcome</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, if you want to bridge or repeat all the traffic, wds is easiest and best way how to achive it. If your main ap does not support wds, you will have to use realyd, but it&#039;s far from perfect.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 1 Feb 2015, 22:35)</p>
