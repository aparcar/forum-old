					<p>I have a TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1 running Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45). Over the last week or two I&#039;ve started getting stalled connection issues on all the machines on my network. Browser connections just stall indefinitely until the page is refreshed. This setup was previously working great for almost a year, and before that for several years running an older OpenWrt on the same router.</p><p>Bandwidth and ping times consistently test excellent. Resetting the hardware has no effect, problem happens immediately. No changes in router config happened and no new machines were added to the network. Problem happens on wireless or wired the same. No strange log messages indicating anything on the router. I hooked a machine directly to the cable modem (Xfinity is provider) with no router and issue was definitely gone. </p><p>I ran some iperf tests on the local network and everything was fine. Also ran an iperf TCP test (ipv4) to a public server on the internet and seemed to work fine.</p><p>Maybe this is some ipv6 upstream configuration change that is causing issues with my router config?</p><p>Any other troubleshooting tips? This seems like it might be a hardware issue but I would think a silent fail there is unlikely. I guess my next step is to update OpenWrt and reset all the router settings.</p>									</div>

					<p>Could it be a DNS issues, i.e. resolution of addresses from your DNS provider? Or perhaps something like the pages that stall use Google analytics, this has often been a cause of long delays (stalls) in my experience.</p>									</div>

					<p>Definitely not DNS related. I did a bunch of DNS performance tests to verify that.</p><p>You could be right about Google analytics but I haven&#039;t seen any particular pattern. About 50% of pages stall without loading, and when I hooked up directly to my modem with no router everything was snappy with no stalls right away.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just ideas. Do you serve DHCP to your clients? Is the address pointing to your router (192.168.1.1 for example)? You could try serving DNS direct (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 for example google&#039;s DNS). To see if there is an issue with <em>dnsmasq</em> on you box. You could even try something like <a href="http://alternate-dns.com/">http://alternate-dns.com/</a> or <a href="https://www.opendns.com/">https://www.opendns.com/</a> to block analytics.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 15 May 2016, 01:01)</p>

					<p>I just paved all settings and installed 15.05.1 ... it seems better but I&#039;m still getting a few stalls when I bang on it. So somewhat inconclusive (great). I&#039;ll use this for a bit and see how it does.</p>									</div>

					<p>You could try taking a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a> trace to see if you can see anything unusual, or long/no responses etc. I assume that you checked your logs for anything unusual (you sound like a person that would have)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 15 May 2016, 02:03)</p>

					<p>I swapped in an old Linksys 802.11g router I had laying around (the one that got replaced by the tplink several years ago). Can&#039;t sustain the bandwidth of my internet connection (100mbps max) but no stalled connections.</p><p>I suppose I could try reverting to the factory tp-link firmware, but openwrt was working perfectly for several years. Anyone think of some sort of upstream change from my provider that could break openwrt but not this old router?</p>									</div>
