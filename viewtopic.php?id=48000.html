					<p>Hi!!<br />I have one router (wr-1043nd) and two ap (wa-901nd) for extending WiFi network.<br />I followed instruction from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds/">here</a>.<br />My problem is that my laptop don&#039;t connect to the wa-901nd. I suspect that need to setup acces point on my wa-901 to act as repeater. I read in documentation this:<br />“To create a repeater, add a WDS Access Point along with the WDS Station on the client,(with the same ssid and key, or not). Don&#039;t forget to add the newly created AP to the LAN firewall Zone.“<br />I&#039;m new to openwrt. How do that? If is not to much is better for me using console and config files.<br />Thanks and Merry Christmas !!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Network is open <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I don&#039;t have right now access to full config files, but basically followed instructions from link mentioned above.<br />I don&#039;t understanding few things.<br />1. On main router need to setup ap and sta for wifi? But on ap, need to have both ap and sta mode? <br />2. Ssid can be the same in all settings? I want to have one single ssid on my network.<br />3. What are relevant part in firewall that need to setup for repeater configuration?<br />I read some posts about wds and repeating using openwrt but still confusing.<br />I want clearly to know what i need to setup on router and ap on this four sections: dhcp, network, wireless and firewall for most simple and basic situation. </p><p>Thanks for reply! Tommorow i will go to get full config files, but i need first to understand.<br />Until now i have this in my mind:<br />On router, lan ip fixed, dhcp enabled, wifi config as ap, nothing special about firewall. <br />On ap, wifi mode sta, dhcp disabled, lan ip f ixed, option wds 1, nothing about firewall.<br />Obviously wifi ssid for router and ap are the same.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vlad2005</strong> on 25 Dec 2013, 00:52)</p>

					<p>Ok, i resolved!!! Added another wifi config on my ap device with mode &quot;ap&quot;, so now i have two block&#039;s, one for &quot;sta&quot; mode for connection with main router and one for &quot;ap&quot; mode to allow client connection. Work well, how is expected.<br />Need to understand more, but need to reading more to not put stupid questions.<br />Thanks!!!</p>									</div>
