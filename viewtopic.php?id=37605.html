					<p>Hi,<br />I just tried to get my Asus WL-330N3G working with OpenWRT. I saw that it&#039;s currently not fully supported by OpenWRT, but as of Changeset 31450 it should be able to compile it by myself:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/31450/trunk">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/31450/trunk</a></p><p>While running &quot;make menuconfig&quot; with r32457 i cannot select the correct Profile:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Target System (Ralink RT288x/RT3xxx)  ---&gt;
Subtarget (RT305x based boards)  ---&gt;
Target Profile
   (X) Default Profile
   ( ) Aztech HW550-3G
   ( ) Belkin F5D8235 v2
   ( ) EnGenius Profile
   ( ) FreeStation5
   ( ) Tenda W306R V2.0</code></pre></div><p>thanks for any kind of help!!</p>									</div>

					<p>oh my god,... I didn&#039;t brick it :-)</p><p>boot with serial interface connected, press &quot;2&quot; to load from TFTP server. Enter device IP (ASUS WL-330N3G), TFTP-Server IP (eg. other OpenWRT Router with atftpd running) and filename. The original filename didn&#039;t work (maybe too long?) so I renamed to test.bin and it worked well!</p><p>I updated the Wiki accordingly:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl-330n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl-330n</a></p><br /><p>best,<br />joky</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joky</strong> on 28 Jun 2012, 07:25)</p>

					<p>Check back through the build log, if you include too many packages etc it will say the image is too large, and refuse to build the binaries at the end.<br />I _think_ if you search &#039;large&#039; it will get you there.</p>									</div>

					<p>I saw it. I build with Default Profile without kernel modules, dropbear, webif, LuCI ...<br />I understand the problem - the kernel size. But there is off almost everything.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />But the building as it was earlier: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/ramips/rt305x/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ ps/rt305x/</a><br />And why are not available options from target/linux/ramips/files/arch/mips/ralink/rt305x/Kconfig?</p>									</div>

					<p>The snapshot is just a snapshot in time of what is going on: normally, it seems to be as good as my picture snapshots: mostly rubbish, but sometimes genius.<br />I can&#039;t answer why the options for the build are unavailable. <br />Is there any reason why you need the snapshot? <br />Snapshot is for developers: i mess around loads with openwrt, but I have never needed the bleeding-edge version. It is more for if you have a new board or new version of a board.</p>									</div>
