					<p>Hi all.<br />I&#039;ve followed the Wiki for the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage">USB storage</a> and have installed all the relevant extra packages.<br />In the GUI (System-&gt;Mount Points-&gt;Mount Points) I&#039;ve created the relevant entry.<br />The device name (/dev/sda1)&nbsp; was already and properly recognized by the system so I just selected the filsystem type (XFS) and left the default options. Then I enabled it and reboot the box.<br />The storage partition didn&#039;t get mounted at boot.<br />I can manually mount an external storage device on the CLI.<br />In the &quot;startup&quot; menu (System-&gt;Startup) I can see that both &quot;fstab&quot; e &quot;mountd&quot; are disabled.<br />What&#039;s missing?</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s another major issue. I think it&#039;s a bug.<br />My external storage is XFS but from time to time during a reboot the file system is not checked/fixed (it should accordingly to the configuration).<br />The system finds a few inconsistencies and then refuses to mount it.<br />At the moment I&#039;m forced to fix it with my Linux box and the to attach it back to the router ...</p><p>Anyone else with the same issue?</p>									</div>
