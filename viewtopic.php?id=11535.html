					<p>I have just switched from Kamikaze 2.6 to Kamikaze 2.4 to get wifi working but i have noticed that Gkrellm no longer works in the sense that every sensor is showing NO activity whatsoever. I must mention that it worked perfectly on Kamikaze 2.6 with just 1,5-1,8 KB/sec traffic consumed.</p><p>I realize this is no emergency...but if anyone had similar troubles and managed to find out the trouble...please let me know.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>									</div>
