					<p>Those config files are in the current trunk and CC1505 branch, but in the released cc their contents were still in /etc/opkg.conf</p><p>You need to edit your opkg config, as you are currently trying to install packages of a different version than your firmware</p><p>EDIT:<br />The download repo for release CC15.05 contains a different Luci version than yours:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/packages/luci/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ ages/luci/</a><br />luci_git-15.245.46763-b179283-1_all.ipk<br />luci_git-15.248.30277-3836b45-1_all.ipk</p><p>The files were built on two dates for firmware images and the imagebuilder. But in any case, 15.248 or 15.245 in the release is 12-15 days later than your 15.233. That version means: luci of 233th day of 2015.</p><p>If I remember right, the CC15.05 release was rebuilt a few days after the release announcement due to problems with package signing keys, so it is possible that you have the &quot;original&quot; release, which is no longer available and has slightly different kernel checksum etc. than the version currently available in the download repo.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 12 Mar 2016, 00:10)</p>
