					<p>I wanted to hear from anyone who has&nbsp; successfully build and installed a Midnight Commander on your box. I was unsuccessful.<br />I build MC myself from svn (/backfire/feeds/packages/utils/mc) PKG_VERSION:=4.7.5.2<br />I was able to install it and run it, however the program appeared unusable. The characters on the screen were messed up and as I moved the cursor up/down, the rows were being replaced with XXXXXXXXXXX. Pretty soon most of the screen was filled up with gobbled X&#039;s.</p><p>Any one knows if I need to do anything special in PuTTY to be able to use MC?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the tip. Mine works fine now after I installed the required dependencies (glib2, libncurses, libiconv).<br />I actually had to set Window-&gt;Translation to ISO-8859-1<br />I still have an issue with internal editor. When I press F4, the only editor I get is VI, regardless of the setting in the Options-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Use internal edit</p>									</div>
