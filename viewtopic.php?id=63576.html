					<p>Hello,</p><p>yesterday I was making a (now I know wrong) sysupgrade on terminal via ssh on my tp link 941nd router.<br />I did chose the wrong image.

Do I need the debrick procedure, as described in the wiki?</p><p>Tobias</p>									</div>

					<p>For forgot to mention, what is the current status of the router...<br />Does it work at all?<br />can you login? at least in failsafe mode?<br />If not, then the device-specific recovery is likely the only option.</p>									</div>

					<p>For sure:<br />The blue power LED is on, but nothing besides.<br />I can&#039;t ping, nor ssh or something else.<br />Edit:<br />I thought of a &quot;easy(tm)&quot; way to solve this, but I think I eventually need the failsafe mode.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bisato</strong> on 22 Mar 2016, 10:31)</p>

					<p>I have more news.<br />I think I can not enter failsafe mode.<br />I used the 192.168.1.1 on my linux system with mediasensing=off.<br />I connected to the router and switched it off, waited, switched on and repeatedly pressed a button (tried both), but no LED began to blink. Nothing happened.<br />Then I tried a hardreset with the RESET Button hold during Power-On. Then the LED with a small lock turned on and&nbsp; did not go out until next poweroff. But during this time, I wasn&#039;t able to ping.<br />I can not solder, so I think I have a (nice looking) Brick.</p><p>Edit:<br />I flashed a original bin with the tftp Method.&nbsp; Hooray! Workin!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bisato</strong> on 22 Mar 2016, 23:46)</p>
