					<p>I am not sure if this topic should go here... Sorry</p><p>So I have a netgear wpn824n wireless access point/switch/router combo. I loaded OpenWRT on to it but now it used all of the space. I can&#039;t reflash the drive because its too full. Luci is not loaded on to it either. Is there a way that I could use USB female to Ethernet to add like an extra drive? I hope this makes sense. </p><p>Thanks,<br />Root3287</p>									</div>

					<p>That device just carries current, and it is used to power dumb USB devices from a PoE switch; it won&#039;t let you use a USB memory on an ethernet port.</p><p>As your router lacks a USB port, I guess you cannot extend the space available.</p>									</div>
