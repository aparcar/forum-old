					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to provide a simple way for non-command-line-people to add new machines to our network. </p><p>I noticed that, if I enter a dynamic DHCP lease in the web GUI (Luci), the name of the new machine is not made available to the DNS server. Do you have any suggestions how to achieve this? </p><p>Basically, whenever the web GUI enters a static lease line into /etc/config/dhcp, I&#039;d like to have the IP and hostname entered into /etc/hosts automatically so dnsmasq will resolve the hostname immediately.</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>									</div>

					<p>Currently, I know of no way to achieve this. Unfortunately, in the next months, I won&#039;t have time to think about a tool to do this, but it would seem pretty easy to implement.</p>									</div>
