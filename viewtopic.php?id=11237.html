					<p>This is about captive portals. </p><p>I want to have an open filesharing service in my high rise building in my college town, but don&#039;t want people to abuse my paid for internet. So here&#039;s what I need: <br />1. A captive portal to send users to a page explaining basics, such as a daily limit, legal things, etc. and how to log into say, a DC++ server or even an open SAMBA server. Of course I would only be condoning creative commons content and free music (such as overclocked remixes). Also its for sharing linux distribution iso&#039;s. </p><p>2. All wireless users will be limited to a certain amount of &quot;web&quot; leeching (from external IPs), like oh...100 megs a day, but have unlimited &quot;internal&quot; leeching (ie. on 192.168.x.x)</p><p>3. When clients hit accept I want their MAC address. That way a database could be created to know how much bandwidth each computer is getting. I know its not fully secure and prone to spoofing, but come&#039;on, everyone thats on wireless would be limited anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Is it possible to do what I want easily? Any suggestions? </p><p>I&#039;m thinking that Chillispot would do this for me, but I dont know much about radius servers- it may be a little &quot;too powerful&quot;. Would &quot;Nocatsplash&quot; do what I want? How do I create a bandwidth limit for wireless users but no limit for lan users?</p><p>I&#039;m a NEWB, I know, but I just switched from ddwrt and openwrt is kinda daunting. I do have some experience with slackware linux (ok, like a year ago. I set it up to be a SAMBA server and haven&#039;t had to really look at it for a LONG time. It kinda just runs successfully). In any case, I am capable of reading up on things. Just give me a keyword/search term and I&#039;ll read about it...</p><p>I think there is a lot of confusion about setting up captive portals in general. Any links to a good guide would be useful. A lot of stuff I find is outdated. </p><p>Thanks. If anything, a link to a good guide on captive portals is appreciated!<br />Keep up the good work!</p><p>PN</p>									</div>
