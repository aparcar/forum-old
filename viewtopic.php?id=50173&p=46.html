					<p>Thanks for working on this.&nbsp; I installed MCWrt last weekend, and everything is working fine.&nbsp; I have a couple things that I would like to get working, like parental restrictions and the guest network, but so far everything looks good.<br />The performance streaming from USB seems a little off, but maybe I am not doing something wrong. --This is my first attempt at OpenWrt, but I will figure it out. With that said, no show stoppers and wireless performance is good.&nbsp; This firmware did take care of an issue that I reported in the Linksys support forums.&nbsp; I had some issues with the the 2.4GHz network causing daily lock-up issues on the router.&nbsp; The only way around it was to disable the 2.4GHz and only use the 5GHz.&nbsp; Considering I paid way more than I should have for this router, I am happy to report that I can use the 2.4GHz network again, and everything seems fine.&nbsp; </p><p>So keep up the great work.&nbsp; I hope you will get more help(if you need it), and continue working on this firmware.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve noticed one weird behavior. When I try to do a PAT (from outside to inside), the router makes me source NAT also.

With this behavior every connection that&#039;s arrived to the server, arrive with the IP from the router and I have no way of knowing who (IP) is trying to connect to my server. <br />Has anyone experienced this? Anyone know how to remove the source NAT. I would like that the public IP from who make the request arrive to my server, not de private IP from the router.</p>									</div>
