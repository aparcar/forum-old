					<p>So... ive been trying to build openwrt but i keep getting this error at the end openwrt recipe for target &#039;world&#039; failed make: *** [world] Error 2</p><p>Ive followed the instructions EXACTLY from here: wiki.openwrt .org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence and then ran: make V=s command to build.</p><p>On that page though, what do they mean by this: &quot;2. Issue all OpenWrt build system commands in the &lt;buildsystem root&gt; directory, e.g. ~/openwrt/trunk/&quot;. Ive been issuing the build commands in ~/openwrt/</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>									</div>

					<p>The &#039;make V=s&#039; command gives you more verbose output on what exactly went wrong. Post the error here, and perhaps we can help.</p><p>The &lt;buildsystem root&gt; refers to the directory to which you clone the GitHub repository. For example, my home directory is &quot;/home/buildbot&quot;. I clone OpenWRT&#039;s git source to the folder &#039;openwrt&#039;. As a result, I would issue all build-related commands in &quot;/home/buildbot/openwrt&quot;. I only use a single branch at a time so this is convenient for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>So... this time i built it i used the command &quot;git clone -b chaos_calmer git://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git&quot; to download openwrt.</p><p>Then i used this command to try to get a log file with only errors, but it didnt work: &quot;make V=s 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee build.log | grep -i error&quot;. I did still get a log file so here it is: <br />s000.tinyupload .com/index.php?file_id=08588339712393673175<br />Remove spaces from the link, im not able to put links in posts yet ;(</p>									</div>

					<p>If you followed the instructions from <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a> then did you also read <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a>? </p><p>The latter contains instructions on how to update the package feeds and use &#039;make menuconfig&#039; to set your target, profile and other build options. I&#039;m just asking to be sure <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The build fails due to a compilation error, and there are several warnings related to missing programs. Some of these programs are not needed, but others, such as the &#039;sdl-config&#039;, might be necessary to configure and modify the source files correctly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 29 Jun 2017, 10:12)</p>

You check what command is being called, then you determine what program or package you need to install to your host OS in order to make this command available.</p>									</div>
