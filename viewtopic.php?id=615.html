					<p>Hi all</p><p>I&#039;m having a bit of a problem with running OpenVPN on the linksys. Well, actually, running it is not a problem. The OpenVPN runs perfectly, and on the linksys I can access the other network without any trouble.</p><p>The only thing now is that the clients that are connected on the LAN side of the linksys, can&#039;t get to the devices. A ping or whatever ends in a void. Since the OpenVPN on the linksys works, and all the routes seems fine, I believe it to be a problem with iptables.<br />I&#039;m using the standard /etc/init.d/S45firewall script, and haven&#039;t changed anything just yet. The OpenVPN connects as client on a remote server using tcp:6005.</p><p>Does anyone have an idea on what rules to add in S45firewall for the LAN side to have access to OpenVPN ?</p><p>If you need more information, let me know and I&#039;ll post some configs here.</p><p>Greetings.</p>									</div>

					<p>after getting the vpn connection up, are you adding the routes?<br />I run 2 scripts via /etc/init.d/rcS </p><p>cd /etc/openvpn<br />/etc/openvpn/connection.sh &amp;<br />sleep 10<br />/etc/openvpn/connection-route.sh</p><p>the sleep 10 is needed because openvpn takes a bit to get going.</p><p>My route add script is this..<br />route add -net 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.4.0.1 </p><p>I use the default firewall except on the locations I want to route ALL traffic through..</p>									</div>

Its WAN interface is connected on the &quot;primary router&quot; and gets its IP from the &quot;primary router&#039;s&quot; DHCP. Could that be the problem?<br />Also note, when I telnet into the Linksys, and do a ping to the corporate subnet (10.10.0.0), it works just fine. When doing the same from the clients, it fails, and traceroute ends at the first hop at 192.168.1.1. Other internet-traffic works fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>No. Should I ?<br />Never had to do that before, but it could make sense.</p><p>Anyway, the more I&#039;m reading about it, the more it could seem that double masquerading (done by the linksys and the other router) would break openvpn somehow.</p><p>Tomorrow I&#039;m going to test by plugging it in directly on a dsl-modem.

					<p>yes, you need to do that as well. At least the way I use opnvpn you do. You have to let the main openvpn server know how to get to your wans(linksys&#039;s lan) subnet. I am no expert on linux networking, but I&#039;m able to fumble my way through it -lol</p><br /><p>here&#039;s an example I do</p><p>i have a 10.10.19.0 network tunneling through the internet, port forwarded from a firewall to an internal&nbsp; openvpn server. I have to add a route on the default gateway there telling all the 10.10.10.0 clients that 10.10.19.0 is accessed via the internal openvpn server (10.10.10.248) and vice versa on the linksys side</p><p>being that you have the default route setup you wont be masqerading any of the wan-lan ip.</p>									</div>

					<p>Greetings,</p><p>In my setup, I use the wrt54gS running openwrt and openvpn 2.0beta15 as my gateway to the internet and also my &quot;default route&quot; for all my computers on my internal LAN. </p><p>For the VPN routes, I just added routes to each computer on my (wired) LAN that needed access to the VPN. </p><p>It took a while to figure out all the routes, and I forgot about the fact that one computer was running Zonealarm (firewall) and I had to tell zonealarm to &quot;trust&quot; the VPN subnet.</p><p>Mostly I use the VPN to provide extra security for my wifi connection (laptop to wrt54gs). It seems to work fine also.&nbsp; I had to &quot;break the bridge&quot; as discussed elsewhere on this website, so that I could keep non-vpn wifi traffic from getting access to my LAN. I&#039;m real happy with the results so far.</p>									</div>
