					<p>I&#039;m running openvpn on openwrt white russian RC3 on a WRT54G linksys<br />router. When I go to a wireless café with my SuSE 10 notebook, I<br />cannot ping my Windows desktop machine at 10.169.1.8. However, I can<br />ssh to my router at 10.169.1.2 using openwrt in route mode.</p><p>Where can I read about the documentation for the syntax for the<br />firewall.user file?

					<p>I guess that enabling the line &quot;client-to-client&quot; in your OpenVPN config file will fix the problem. Have a look at settings from my setup below.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Internal IP-range 192.168.1.1 /255.255.255.0<br />OpenVPN IP-range 172.17.2.0 /255.255.255.0</p><p>In server.ovpn (your openvpn config file) I have the usual stuff but the following might be of interest to you:<br />........<br /># Routed<br />server 172.17.2.0 255.255.255.0</p><p># Push route to client (might give you problems at a internet cafe with range 192.168.1.0 /255.255.255.0?? never tried don&#039;t know) <br />push &quot;route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0&quot;</p><p># WINS (only applicable if you have samba running and configured as WINS on the router)<br />push &quot;dhcp-option WINS 192.168.1.1&quot;</p><p># Allow traffic from one client to other clients on the VPN (probably you don&#039;t have this configured!)<br /># Uncomment this directive to allow different clients to be able to &quot;see&quot; each other.<br /># By default, clients will only see the server!!!<br />client-to-client<br />........</p><p>I added the following lines to firewall.user:<br />.......<br /># Allow TUN interface connections to OpenVPN server<br />iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT<br /># Allow TUN interface connections to be forwarded through other interfaces<br />iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT<br />.......</p><p>In this way I can reach all systems on my local network and or connected true OpenVPN. I never tried Samba client-to-client with two OpenVPN connected systems as this is a not very often occuring scenario in my setup.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a notebook computer at a wireless café that can connect to my openwrt router on my home network and see my desktop computer in bridging mode. <br />Because I was running in bridging mode, I don&#039;t need to run openvpn on my desktop computer.</p><p>Now I need to run openvpn in routing mode (as I described above).

					<p>Yes but in the documentation (openvpn FAQ) it says I have to add something (firewall command or &quot;route add&quot; on the windows desktop machine) to show the ping (for example) packet how to get back to its origen (the notebook at the wireless cafe).</p><p>This could explain why I am not seeing anything.</p>									</div>

					<p>Problem solved. Both the pool and the server and the push route command must specify the same subnet outside the subnet of your LAN. The reason you can get to it is because of the &quot;route add&quot; command. This seems very strange to me but it works!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d like to install an openvpn <em>client</em> on the router and use it only for outgoing (not incoming) ssh and irc traffic. How does one implement such a setting? All the documents in the wiki describe the openvpn as a server in openwrt.</p><p>Edit: Well. There was one, but it was something about Cisco VPN. And I really want to use WAN access as a default, so VPN only for ssh and irc.

					<p>Maybe you could elborate a bit on what your trying to achieve. I have completely no clue. To what server are you going to connect your router cq client? And after connecting your client, you want to tunnel ssh and irc traffic from your router over this VPN to this other server? You do understand you need some kind of remote endpoint also running OpenVPN?</p><p>The OpenVPN package in OpenWRT will give you BOTH the client and the server. Actually only the configuration file determines how the package is going to behave. You could even have a client and server running along side eachother using a different port. One in client mode connecting to your office network and the other in server mode waiting for you to connect as a client with your laptop from the internet cafe.&nbsp; </p><p>To install the package just type:<br />ipkg install openvpn </p><p>And then give the package a try with the configuration files on OpenVPN.org</p><p>Server: <a href="http://openvpn.net/howto.html#server">http://openvpn.net/howto.html#server</a><br />Client: <a href="http://openvpn.net/howto.html#client">http://openvpn.net/howto.html#client</a></p><p>Needless to say you do also need a remote endpoint running either one of the opposites OpenVPN modes.</p><p>Do you want to connect two dynamic ip addresses? Have a look at <a href="http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dynamic-address">http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dynamic-address</a> for fixing this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>500gx</strong> on 18 Aug 2006, 19:55)</p>

mlock

mtu-test

					<p>Now I complete get what you are trying to achieve. </p><p>Your current option: &quot;redirect-gateway def1&quot; takes care of routing all your traffic over the gateway. You probably need to remove this option and replace it by a different option, i am thinking of the options &quot;route&quot;, &quot;route-gateway&quot; etc. <br />In addition I think you are going to have to create a static tap device on your router and create some custom routing using iptables to do the forwarding of only the ports 22, 25 and 6667. <br />To go through the VPN for only certain websites/DNS names you will have to do some additional wizardry using a transparent proxy. But all this is getting pretty advanced and I can&#039;t really help you out here. For the proxy you could have a look at one of the packages, tinyproxy, privoxy or squid.</p>									</div>
