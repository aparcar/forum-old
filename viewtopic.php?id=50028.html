Did you try <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420#failsafe">failsafe</a> ?</p><p>If you cannot get the router back to work through failsafe, telnet etc, you will need to use a serial adapter to directly access the serial console to see whats going on and to possibly flash a new firmware image / reconfigure openwrt. This also means that you will have to solder a few wires into place. Be warned though that you <strong>NEED TO USE A SERIAL ADAPTER RUNNING AT 3V3</strong> or you <strong>will permanently damage</strong> your router!</p>									</div>
