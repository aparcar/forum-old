					<p>Hi!<br />When my computer did reflashing of my D-Link DSL-G604T router, I have trouble with electric energy, and it was crashed. Riuter can start and some legs are light, but router don&#039;t works. I tried use solution for reflash it in force mode from Windows using exe file from D-Link site, it can&#039;t works, but leg&#039;s light was changing. After one week in service center of my provider, flashing program of D-Link can&#039;t change leg&#039;s light too. We buy new, ZyXEL, router, it is easy and without Wi-Fi, but one day ago I read about openWRT. Is it possible to hack my D-Link DSL-G604T and flash openWRT program or official flash program version 3 after crashed flash?</p>									</div>
