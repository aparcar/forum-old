					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;ve quite a weird situation here. Recently I switched radio from Broadcom to Atheros chipset and now I can easily make my computer crash with Blue Screen Of Death by applying a constant load on it. Previously I were using an ASUS WL500gP with stock radio but now I switched to ALIX board with TP-LINK TL-WN560G card.&nbsp; And now with running uTorrent and speed around 10Mbit/s it&#039;s just a matter of time to get a BSOD.</p><p>The errors codes are 0xa and 0xd1. Windows Debugging Tools blames netw5v64.sys for crash and it stands for a component from Intel WiFi driver. I tried different WiFi drivers with the same result.</p><p>So far I tend to blame the either netw5v64.sys or madwifi. </p><p>Can someone with similar setup that involves Intel WiFi card on Windows x64 that is served by a OpenWRT router with Atheros card confirm it or deny it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Changed the radio card to TL-WN861N that runs under ath9k driver. But unfortunately system still crashes. </p><p>Tomorrow I&#039;ll try to test it under another Intel 4965AGN card.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I was a little bit too quick in writing back. After 4 hours it crashed.</p><p>So far I tried it on two different Thinkpads T61, different radio cards (TL-WN560G and TL-WN861N) and different boards for OpenWRT (ASUS WL500gPv1 and PCEngines Alix 6b2) with the same results - a STOP Error of 0x0000000A or 0x000000D1. Leaving all the hardware components involved in transmission.</p><p>The only thing left are drivers and most likely the Intel driver is causing it, because I tried both madwifi on TL-WN560G and ath9k on TL-WN861N with the same result. Actually it might be wrong assumption, because I believe madwifi and ath9k might share some code.</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas what to test more? And how to submit this case to either Intel or Lenovo?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nas</strong> on 28 Jun 2009, 14:34)</p>

					<p>Hi<br />I never had such problem with my intel 3945 and 2945 wifi cards and my WL-500gP atheros wifi.<br />Even if there might be a problem in the madwifi driver, the windows laptop shouldn&#039;t bluescreen. So I would say that the main problem is on the laptop side (and not the router).</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, zorxd I would think so too. But there&#039;s quite unuasual trend here. </p><p>Install an atheros card and observe BSOD, swap it with Broadcom card and everything is working. </p><p>In any case, I&#039;ve already submitted a case to Customer Support Service and they&#039;re waiting me with this notebook. I hope we will find out the true cause.</p>									</div>
