					<p>Just by reading your post there can be a few things that is going on. </p><p>First - If you have a DSL modem make sure that the modem is in &quot;bridged mode&quot; since your router is going to be handling NAT. (if your dsl modem is&nbsp; also a router)</p><p>Second - you will have to turn off DHCP on the modem (again if your dsl modem is a router/modem)</p><p>Then you have to make sure your pinging the same subnet that your LAN is on.&nbsp; Cause in your post I see your modem is 192.168.1.1 and your router is 192.168.5.1 &lt;------ TWO DIFFERENT SUBNETS&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1 &amp; 5.1,&nbsp; What IP were you trying to ping a public IP or a private IP ?&nbsp; Or a dns name?</p><p>Regards,<br />ScarEye</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp; Let me clarify.&nbsp; The DSL modem gives the router a WAN address of 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; I set the router LAN address to be 192.168.5.1, and it gives out 192.168.5.x addresses to the connected PCs.&nbsp; I get a destination host unreachable message on my pc when I ping any address including 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.5.1.</p><p>Why would NAT mode on the DSL modem not work?&nbsp; The router should route my packets out to the DSL modem, and the DSL modem, in turn, should route them out to the Internet?&nbsp; What am I missing?</p><p>Also, web browsing DOES work, it&#039;s just ping that doesn&#039;t .</p><p>Thanks,<br />Igor</p>									</div>

					<p>I just realized that it&#039;s nodogsplash that is stopping ping - if I shut it down everything works.&nbsp; So, I just need to figure out how to connect to my VPN with nodogsplash running.&nbsp; I probably need to open up some more ports.</p><p>Thanks!<br />Igor</p>									</div>
