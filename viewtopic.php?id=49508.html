					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>TLDR: Would like to automatically restart OpenVPN(/etc/init.d/openvpn restart) whenever Interface &#039;wan&#039; successfully connected, how would a hotplug script doing this look like?</p><p>I&#039;m running OpenWRT 12.09 on my TP-Link with a relatively complicated setup(pppoe over wifi and openvpn as a client, and the resulting route in turn serves the clients of the TP-Link with a connection through a 2nd wifi interface) and it is actually working pretty well except for when the PPPOE(wan) connection drops, which unfortunately happens rather frequently:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Feb  6 17:22:06 Wifiname daemon.info pppd[4413]: No response to 5 echo-requests
Feb  6 17:22:06 Wifiname daemon.notice pppd[4413]: Serial link appears to be disconnected.
Feb  6 17:22:06 Wifiname daemon.info pppd[4413]: Connect time 81.9 minutes.
Feb  6 17:22:06 Wifiname daemon.info pppd[4413]: Sent 3320155 bytes, received 51773710 bytes.
Feb  6 17:22:06 Wifiname daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; has lost the connection
Feb  6 17:22:07 Wifiname daemon.notice pppd[4413]: Connection terminated.</code></pre></div><p>It usually reconnects successfully after a couple of seconds, but OpenVPN apparantly does not cleanly restart/reconnect/re-establish its routes. The easiest workaround for me was to just restart OpenVPN. This is what I&#039;d like to automate, but I don&#039;t seem to be knowledgable enough to get it right. How would I go about doing this?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any input or help, it&#039;s much appreciated. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BoarByte</strong> on 13 Mar 2014, 19:22)</p>

					<p>Hi BoarByte,</p><p>you really did hit a very crucial point.</p><p>To my knowledge there is not hotplug event, or any event triggered by an interface going down.</p><p>Additionally the whole hotplug related system is undergoing a radical change from AA to BB (trunk)<br />i.e new procd,netlink,netifd,ubus,udev and other &quot;goodies&quot; like json coded data and conversion.</p><p>The new interface-functions are not always synchron to the well known ifconfig a.s.o. so beware !</p><p>I did try several aproaches to remedy or rather circumvent this &quot;black hole&quot;.</p><p>Equal problems have been tried to resolved by :</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26767">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26767</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39869">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39869</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39052">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39052</a></p><p>Did try following and was working somhow</p><p>1. create a con job and test your interface/connection doing the approprated steps (exmpl:watchping)</p><p>2. analyse the log output<br />2.1.&nbsp; reroute log output to IP socket and have a service listen to it &amp; analyse<br />2.2&nbsp; &nbsp;inotify (busybox) watch for change logfile (set log output to file) and analyse<br />2.3&nbsp; &nbsp;icrond&nbsp; ( same idea)</p><p>3. find a way to &quot;inject&quot; interface down function in netifd/ubus/procd/ or other more useful system event handlers</p><p>Keep in mind htat there are serveral ways interface status may be interpreted&nbsp; ( iface DOWN, UP-not connected<br />for the time beeing i was not able to find a &quot;real&quot; event-handling in trunk ( &gt; 39800 ) nor satisfying informations how to<br />realize .</p><p>At the end i started to dig into the system and doing an overview how all that hotplug-stuff clings together.</p><p>Any further info would be highly apreciated</p><p>regards</p>									</div>
