					<p>So according to this: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79504">https://code.google.com/p/android/issue â€¦ l?id=79504</a> the Android L has a known issue where it ignores the DNS domain coming from DHCP or static configuration and always uses the Google DNS servers. On top of that, Google Chrome seems to be using hard-coded Google DNS servers via IPv6. </p><p>The following is credited to rhester72, who provided great instructions on how to make sure that both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS requests from the devices connected to the router are intercepted (in my case to make sure that script I run to block ads by redirecting certain domains to a transparent gif works for these devices).</p><p>First install the required packages:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>opkg update<br />opkg install ip ip6tables-mod-nat kmod-ipt-nat6</p></blockquote></div><p>Then run the following:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>echo &quot;iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i br-lan -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to `/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep -m 1 inet | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user<br />echo &quot;iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i br-lan -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to `/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep -m 1 inet | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user<br />echo &quot;ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination [`/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep inet6 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`]&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user<br />echo &quot;ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination [`/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep inet6 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`]&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/firewall.user</p></blockquote></div><p>And reboot the router.</p><p>Now your Android L devices (well, all the devices on your network really) will be using your router&#039;s DNS instead of whatever is hardcoded.</p><p>PS. If you want to intercept the DNS requests only from specific devices, you can add&nbsp; &quot;-m mac --mac-source &lt;MAC_of_Android_L_device&gt;&quot; after the &quot;br-lan&quot; to the iptables rules above. </p><p>Again -- huge thanks to Rodney for coming up with this solution.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 9 Mar 2015, 23:08)</p>

					<p>Hey Rodney, thank you so much for your prompt reply.</p><p>Some follow-up questions:<br />1. The interface (br0) should be set to the interface where the requests are coming from? Or the bridge?<br />2. That would not prevent the router itself from reaching the google DNS servers, right?<br />3. I&#039;m a bit confused about iptables chain/rules difference, so if I wanted to remove those two things from iptables -- what should I do?</p>									</div>

					<p>1. The bridge, unless you want to do something different for wireless vs. wired.<br />2. No, those requests originate from your WAN interface.<br />3. The rules should be added (complete, just as you&#039;d enter them from the CLI, including the iptables command itself) to /etc/firewall.user.&nbsp; If you wish to disable them for some reason, either remove them from that file or comment them out.</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>

					<p>Two problems that I see:</p><p>- You changed br0 to br-lan, but didn&#039;t change PREROUTING to prerouting_rule - however, this is largely a &#039;decorative&#039; problem with your current ruleset (the rules are still being triggered, as the above shows the rule was hit over IPv4 143 times, so v4 lookups are definitely being &#039;captured&#039;)<br />- The above suggests that Chrome is almost certainly using IPv6 for lookups (basically, what seems to be happening is the request is arriving at your router over v6, but is then being forwarded to the Internet over v4, if I were to guess)</p><p>Let&#039;s test that theory, if you don&#039;t mind.</p><p>Enter the following at the command prompt:</p><p>ip6tables -A input_rule -i br-lan -p udp --dport 53 -j LOG<br />ip6tables -A input_rule -i br-lan -p tcp --dport 53 -j LOG</p><p>Do some browsing with Chrome on Android, then:</p><p>ip6tables -L input_rule -nv</p><p>and paste the output (if one or both are being hit, you&#039;ll see the counters be non-zero).</p><p>If that&#039;s the case (and based on reading the complaints to Google about hard-coding of DNS servers, it likely is), I&#039;ll see if we can craft a RFC-violating rule for v6 to capture similarly to v4 (and would suggest you keep both, once we get this working properly I&#039;ll bake a final &#039;recipe&#039; for this that should work for anyone).</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>

Since I cached all the packages the day I installed, I just rebooted to drop the updated opkg and installed the individual ipk files from my cache.</p><p>I&#039;m completely in the dark about ipv6 -- will that address in the rules ever change? What if I reflash openwrt?</p><p>If you&#039;re ever in Vancouver, BC -- I owe you a beer man.</p>									</div>

					<p>The address in the rules shouldn&#039;t change - it&#039;s called a ULA address, and is determined semi-randomly by OpenWRT on first install.&nbsp; It&#039;s contained in /etc/config/network as option ula_prefix, and is used as a fallback if no other IPv6 subnet is defined but IPv6 is enabled.&nbsp; It is *not* a global and *not* routable (i.e. it cannot reach the Internet), but will be used throughout your LAN on any IPv6-enabled devices (which is a great many of them, these days).&nbsp; If you were to do a full-up reflash, yes, it would be recalculated during firstboot.</p><p>Theoretically, you could &quot;future-proof&quot; (untested) in the following manner:</p><p>ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination [`/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep inet6 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`]<br />ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination [`/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep inet6 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`]</p><p>That _should_ recalculate the global IPv6 bind to br-lan on each invocation of /etc/config/firewall, assuming it will allow proper subshell execution.&nbsp; Feel free to test.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>

					<p>Rodney, thanks again -- I&#039;m using a setup script to put all my settings back, so I just added these to the script.

					<p>Glad to hear it - you can do the same substitution for the IPv4 global, just changing this:</p><p>`/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep inet6 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`</p><p>to read like this instead:</p><p>`/usr/sbin/ip addr show dev br-lan | grep global | grep &quot;inet &quot; | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1`</p><p>(note the space after inet).&nbsp; That should pretty much bullet-proof it even if you re-subnet your IPv4 LAN.</p><p>This solution probably has more value than just Android Lollipop - for those who use dnsmasq to block certain sites by name, it&#039;s pretty easy to bypass by just manually setting DNS servers on the client unless you do something like this to force &quot;captive DNS&quot;.&nbsp; If someone (other than me) would like to properly summarize the approach (modules, the firewall.user rules with substitution, etc.) as a sticky, they are more than welcome to - everything needed is contained within this post, but it&#039;s a bit &quot;spread out&quot; and not necessarily as clear and concise as it probably should be for a sticky recipe.</p><p>Maybe someday Google will actually fix the underlying problem!&nbsp; *laughs*</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, supposedly the 5.1 release is just around the corner and it&#039;s supposed to be fixed there.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried the &quot;inet &quot; thing, but:<br />1.

					<p>You can avoid the double-quoting issue by using vi instead of tacking on with echo, but that might be harder to automate - I&#039;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Yes, having an additional IP for pixelserv would be problematic, though.&nbsp; &lt;G&gt;</p><p>I did not notice the update to the OP - good work!&nbsp; You may want to slightly expand it to mention that device-specific filtering can be accomplished via specifying a source MAC in the iptables rules, if for some reason someone should not want all devices forced through local DNS (though it&#039;s hard for me to even envision a use case like that).</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>
