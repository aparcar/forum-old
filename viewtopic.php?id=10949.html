					<p>Hello!<br />Guys, is there any possibility to mount NTFS volume (external HDD, interfaced via USB) on whiterussian 0.9 (2.4 kernel)?<br />I can see that 3G-NTFS is supported by 2.6 only.</p><p>What about 2.4? I&#039;m using ASUS WL-500g Premium.</p><p>Thanks in advance.<br />Max.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried that too, but couldn&#039;t get it to work.<br />I wanted it because i usually formated external HDDs with NTFS.<br />Now i chose FAT32 (vfat) and that works fine in both environments (XP &amp; openWRT).</p><p>Cheers, Hannes</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hanz</strong> on 31 May 2007, 19:10)</p>

					<p>hanz,<br />Thanks for reply. I also thought about switching to FAT32, but it has max file size about 4G(if my memory tells me right), And this is not my case:(<br />Also i thought about using ext2/3 (there is a file system driver available for win32 platform), but it sounds very ugly to me.<br />I just wanted to know is there any chance to port it on 2.4 kernel, i don&#039;t believe that only I wanted to have NTFS support:). If yes, so i will give it a try, otherwise i will not even touch it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did format my 20gig USB disc with fat32. Runs well on samba/openwrt and XP.<br />Before that, i also did search the web/forums for ntfs support on openWRT, but that always ended in &quot;not finding a solution&quot;.<br />If you have success, just leave me a note <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
