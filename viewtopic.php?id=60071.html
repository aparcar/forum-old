					<p>So the Archer C5 has the same hardware as the Archer C7 and you can flash a C5 to perform the same as a C7 as shown here: </p><p><a href="https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.thesen.eu%2Fwie-aus-einem-tp-link-archer-c5-ac1200-ein-archer-c7-ac1750-wurde%2F&amp;edit-text=">https://translate.google.co.uk/translat â€¦ edit-text=</a> </p><p>So my question is can this be done in the D5 to the D7? </p><p>I have searched as much as I can but info on the D5 and D7 seems pretty limited but everything I have seems points to them having the same hardware, same casing, same antenna, same CPU, same wireless chipsets, same ram etc </p><p>So could this be done? Reason I ask is because I recently bought a D5 as it was very cheap brand new and if I can squeeze a bit more performance from it I will </p><p>I am happy to try and test this, could it be done the same way as the C5? Which openwrt or ddwrt version would I flash?</p>									</div>
