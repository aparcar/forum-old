					<p>A rather cute configuration is to use a firewall in transparent bridging more.&nbsp; The nice thing here is that you don&#039;t need to change any config on all the machines in the network.&nbsp; It&#039;s even more appropriate if the firewall is mainly doing QOS as well.</p><p>Any ideas on how to setup the WRT54GS to have the WAN and LAN bridged like this?&nbsp; I have this setup working fine on my big linux machine with two real net cards, however, I am having a number of problems making it work on the WRT</p><p>The closest that I have got so far (and it nearly works ok) is to setup three VLANs</p><p>vlan0 = lan (ports 1,2)<br />vlan1 = WAN (port 0)<br />vlan2 = DMZ</p><br /><p>Then setup the bridge on the LAN:</p><p>lan_ifnames=vlan0 vlan1 eth1<br />lan_ifname=br0<br />wan_ifname=vlan1</p><p>vlan2 is routed to a seperate subnet right now because I can&#039;t make any other config work...</p><p>However, this does actually bridge between the lan and wan, but ONLY if I give the wan an IP address and subnet...&nbsp; The whole point really is that you don&#039;t want to do this.&nbsp; So, basically the working config seems to be to have LAN and WAN with the same iprange and subnet - however, I haven&#039;t yet tested whether I can actually use netfilter to limit packets with this config either (and also apply QOS)</p><p>Also, in this configuration name resolution seems to be broken.. Can anyone describe how the WRT does name resolution?&nbsp; Seems to me that /etc/resolve.conf is always correct, but it works or doesn&#039;t depending on how I define lan_dns and wan_dns...?&nbsp; Why is this?</p><p>Grateful for any help making this work</p><p>Complete dump of relevant variables is below:</p><p>lan_dns=192.168.105.254<br />lan_gateway=192.168.105.254<br />lan_ifname=br0<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0 vlan1 eth1<br />lan_ipaddr=192.168.105.10<br />lan_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />lan_proto=static<br />vlan0hwname=et0<br />vlan0ports=1 2 5*<br />vlan1hwname=et0<br />vlan1ports=0 5<br />vlan2hwname=et0<br />vlan2ports=3 4 5<br />wan_dns=192.168.105.254<br />wan_gateway=192.168.105.254<br />wan_ifname=vlan1<br />wan_ipaddr=192.168.105.250<br />wan_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />wan_proto=static</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, figured most of this out.&nbsp; Seems that its easy to end up with the other vlans in the bridge not being started, especially if you use &quot;proto=none&quot;...</p><p>Once the wan vlan was properly started then the bridge works ok.</p><p>However, I still have a problem in that if the dns server is on the default gateway address then address resolution doesn&#039;t seem to work...&nbsp; Changing to another DNS server works fine though.</p>									</div>
