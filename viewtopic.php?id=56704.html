					<p>This project is another Internet radio, but (of course) IMHO is the best one <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>It is built using a TPLink MR3020 with extroot, usb sound card and usb hub, gstreamer is used to play the streams.<br />Some good things are &quot;imported&quot; from other free projects, and also some original ideas are there, if you do some digging (after all, there is only a web server and a few other files involved). I think you&#039;ll like it.</p><p>What makes it different:<br />- it has a fairly complete and easy to use web “remote control” (see bellow), so you can control it entirely from your smartphone/laptop, including connecting to another access-point (think mobility), adding/removing streams and playlists (pls, m3u, xsfp)&nbsp; from the interface, etc<br />- it can also be controlled without web access from the physical button (basic control only, using the physical button available on the router – next radio station, mute, reboot)<br />- information about currently playing song are extracted from the stream (every 3 seconds)<br />- knows all popular radio streaming formats (many projects on the Internet understand only mp3 streams, whether or not it is specified by the authors)<br />Link<br /><a href="https://yunofun.wordpress.com/yet-another-internet-radio-box/">https://yunofun.wordpress.com/yet-anoth … radio-box/</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/c2sandu/webradio/">https://github.com/c2sandu/webradio/</a></p><p>I&#039;ll deliver a step by step guide as soon as I have more time.</p><p>Enjoy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://yunofun.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-1.png" alt="Radio" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Version 2 is out, now with installer script!</p><p>The changes are not spectacular at interface level, but the main change is the addition of the installer script. I think this is better and easier than the promised step-by-step guide <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The script installs the prerequisites - kmod-usb-audio kmod-sound-core alsa-utils gstreamer gstreamer-utils and so on - then downloads web interface files from Github and installs them in /www (pay attention that it overwrites existing files in /www). In this way you are ready to go in minutes.</p><p><a href="https://yunofun.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/yet-another-internet-radio-version-2-with-installer-script/">https://yunofun.wordpress.com/2015/11/1 … er-script/</a></p><p>You need to have a functional extroot filesystem (in order to have enough room for the needed packages). It should work on all routers provided that it has a functional extroot filesystem and of course USB audio hardware.</p><p>If you are familiar with Easy Extroot, the radio installer script is included by default in Easy Extroot v2 - /etc/init.d/radio</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://yunofun.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/radio.png" alt="https://yunofun.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/radio.png" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://yunofun.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/install.jpg" alt="https://yunofun.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/install.jpg" /></span></p><p>Have fun! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>A nice project, but I wouldn&#039;t even touch it, ATM. If I may make some suggestions. You should improve file structure in such a way that its installation won&#039;t over write any existing files, except to amend / remove during installation / removal procedures, respectively.</p>									</div>

					<p>As stated above, only files in /www are overwritten (the web interface), if having the same name (index.html and index.cgi are probable replaced if they exist). Of course, you cannot have a functional web interface if copying only partially the web files! </p><p>Beside those files in /www, no other files are overwritten. Only rc.local is appended with a command to start the player at startup.</p><p>Also, the scripts informs the user that it overwrites files in the /www directory (see above) and the whole script is easy to read so you can see what it does behind the scenes.</p><p>Anyway, thanks a lot for the feedback, I&#039;ll think about some improvements based on your comment.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hint:<br />You might use dnsmasq-option: local=/radio/<br />And modify /www/index.html to check for domain &quot;radio&quot;, to redirect to your files.<br />Like this in /www/index.html:<br />&lt;BODY&gt;<br />&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br />var currentLoc = window.location;<br />if (currentLoc == &quot;<a href="http://control.radio/">http://control.radio/</a>&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; window.location=&#039;radiocontrol.php&#039;;<br />else if (currentLoc == &quot;<a href="http://control.radio">http://control.radio</a>&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; window.location=&#039;radiocontrol.php&#039;;<br />&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>Then user can browse to &quot;control.radio&quot;, radiocontrol.php is started, and you do not interfere with standard index.html.</p>									</div>
