					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I installed kamikaze 8.09 RC2 on my Asus WL-500gp a few days ago and got most of the important stuff working in the meantime.</p><p>There is one thing I realized, but I&#039;m not sure now if it is RC2 specific or if it was there already on RC1:<br />I can&#039;t reach some websites which are up when connecting from different networks. My first guess was that the correct MTU (1492 in my case) was set incorrectly in the pppoe part of RC2. But checking the corresponding scripts and the commandline in ps ax proved me wrong.</p><p>After some searching I found that sometimes the MTU set by the dhcp server can cause problems, too - and that seems to be the case here.<br />My clients have an MTU of 1500 when they receive their settings from the kamikaze box. If I set the MTU to 1492 manually with an ifconfig command (on the client), everything works.</p><p>Now I&#039;ve been looking for a way to influence the MTU which is set by dhcp in /etc/config/dhcp but I couldn&#039;t find one. Does anyone have a hint here?</p><p>Cheers,<br />hol9000</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, to directly add to my above post:<br />dnsmasq --help dhcp<br />shows the known dhcp options.<br />So I went on and added the following line to /etc/config/dhcp in the config &#039;dhcp&#039; &#039;lan&#039; section:<br />option &#039;mtu&#039; &#039;1492&#039;</p><p>Unfortunately neither<br />/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart<br />nor rebooting the router (and the client to start from a default network setup there as well) didn&#039;t help.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Cheers,<br />hol9000</p>									</div>
