					<p>OpenWRT is a complete system of kernel and applications, all pre-compiled and distributed in binary form, usually in one image file that can be written to the flash ROM of a wifi router-- replacing entirely the manufacturer&#039;s firmware which usually has very limited functionality and no extensibility.&nbsp; After installation, OpenWRT has a read-write filesystem and a package manager which can be used to download and install additional functions either as kernel modules or userspace applications.</p><p>So to install on a PC you would make a separate partition or use a removable drive and boot directly into OpenWRT, bypassing your existing OS entirely.&nbsp; The PC then becomes primarily a router.&nbsp; Any network cards, wifi cards, 3G modems, etc. that are installed can be used for networking.&nbsp; It can also be extended to many other functions (file server, PBX SIP server, etc) with packages, but as OpenWRT is mostly run on devices with no keyboard or screen, end-user usage like web browsing or word processing is not the objective.</p><p>It is possible to download the source code and re-compile (cross-compile) with a standard full Linux installation to create new image files if necessary, but most users will not find that necessary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 12 Dec 2014, 08:08)</p>
