					<p>So I&#039;ve had a user come to me asking for firmware for a WRT1900ACS V2.<br />I didn&#039;t know they had done an ACS V2?<br />Any specs or details?<br />The stock firmware certainly exists on the linksys page.</p><p>Edit:<br />I pinged the support team and got the following;<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The WRT1900ACS V1 and WRT1900ACS V2 routers&#039; specs are just the same, especially with their CPU processor, wireless technology, PHY Data Rate, External Antennas, SATA support, Internal Fan, etc., the only difference is that WRT1900ACS V2 is not an open source firmware yet; this mean we can&#039;t use third party firmware for this router.
