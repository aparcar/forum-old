					<p>Hi Swift,</p><p>LuCI is living in a separated &quot;feed&quot;: it is not integrated in the OpenWrt base set of packages.</p><p>The available feeds are listed in the &quot;feeds.conf&quot; file in the root OpenWrt directory.</p><p>As it is alredy listed in it, you have first to download the LuCI feed&#039;s package descriptions using:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds update luci</code></pre></div><p>You can also download the optional OpenWrt non-base packages the same way:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds update packages</code></pre></div><p>Then install the LuCI feed, so you see it in the &quot;make menuconfig&quot; display in order to select it for inclusion:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds install luci</code></pre></div><p>You can also install the additional OpenWrt packages the same, way, it will add a bunch of things to select from!<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds install packages</code></pre></div><p>All this is described in the Wikie <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/feeds">here</a>. The Wiki is always the best place to start searching <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start?do=index">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start?do=index</a></p><p>I strongly recommend to switch from the default W95-looking &quot;OpenWrt&quot; theme to the modern &quot;Boostrap&quot; theme. Provided you selected it in the menuconfig, once running on your device, go to &quot;System &gt; System &gt; Language and Style &gt; Style&quot; and choose &quot;Boostrap&quot; from the drop-down list.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 10 Nov 2012, 10:03)</p>

					<p>Hi Squonk,</p><p>Thankyou for your advice. </p><p>However, the problem that I encounter is that my AP doesn&#039;t have an internet connection. Therefore, I could not install any packages require for the deployment. Is there any ways to allow my AP to have internet connection like through tethering or something? The AP model that I am currently using is WRTsl54gs. </p><p>Please provide me any guide should you have any. Thankyou! </p><p>Regards,<br />SWIFT</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Swift,</p><p>Well I don&#039;t understand: you asked first for an advice on how to get the LuCI packages for inclusion during compilation: what I described is the way to add the LuCI (and other) additional packages for compilation on your PC.</p><p>Alternatively, you can download on your PC the latest stable (non-trunk) firmware snapshot, that should also contain the LuCI packages by default.</p><p>But if you wan to compile your own firmware and you get an error when compiling, you should first make sure that you have a correct dev environment on your Linux PC. Under Ubuntu or any Debian-based distro, you can do that by issuing:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential</code></pre></div><p>Once you have downloaded OpenWrt base distro (what you probably did already), type in the command I gave you previously, then &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to first choose your device and select the LuCI packages you want (probably &quot;admin-full&quot;). Then &quot;make&quot;.</p><p>If you get an error, try re-running &quot;make V=s&quot; to get details on the error as suggested, and copy the end of the lengthy log near the end, when you start to see error messages and paste it here, so you can get help.</p><p>You should then obtain firmware images in the &quot;bin&quot; directory (for factory or sysupgrade), that you can install on your AP.</p><p>You then have to find a way to install this firmware into the device. If you don&#039;t have the LuCI web admin interface on it, you should still be able to connect to it using &quot;telnet&quot; if you still have not setup a password for &quot;root&quot;, or using &quot;ssh&quot; afterwards.</p><p>You have then to install some kind of TFTP, FTP or HTTP server on your PC, so you can fetch the firmware file from the AP. Please refer to <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=182265">this thread</a> for more information regarding the subject.</p><p>Once the new LuCI-enabled firmware is running on your AP, you can use it to configure your Internet access.</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys, after finished installing LUCI, I can see the web interfaces of LUCI. </p><p>However, when I want to start my Openflow using the command &quot;/etc/init.d/openflow start&quot; I encounter problems. The Openflow is unable to connect to my controller. I have already did changes to the network config and openflow config. The error shows that <strong>netdev|ERR|ioctl on br-lan device failed</strong>. Any idea what causes this error? </p><p>Thankyou and sorry for the trouble.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mp-swift</strong> on 12 Nov 2012, 09:19)</p>

					<p>Hi mp-swift,&nbsp; for openflow, do you use the datapath provided in Linux kernel? if so, where do you get user space utilities?</p>									</div>
