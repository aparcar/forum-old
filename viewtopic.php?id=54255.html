					<p>Hi eveyrone,</p><p>So, I made some very stupid edits to my /etc/config/network and completely broke access to my router.&nbsp; I am trying to fix them somehow but am having no luck at all logging in to my router, which is a D-Link DIR-825.&nbsp; (http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-825 ).&nbsp; I tried booting into failsafe mode trying the generic instructrions, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe,">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe,</a> but have had no luck.&nbsp; I htin tried reinstalling using the firmware recovery mode:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-825#installation.using.firmware.recovery.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir- â€¦ overy.mode</a></p><p>but the upload transaction never successfully completes.&nbsp; I tried using the C program that is provided on that page, and while the upload completed after about an hour, I waited 7 hours for a response and didn&#039;t get one, so I assume something is wrong there.&nbsp; The failsafe page suggests, for troubleshooting, the following steps to enter frailsafe via serial console:</p><br /><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unplug the router&#039;s power cord.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Connect the router&#039;s WAN port directly to your PC.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Configure your PC with a static IP address between 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.254. E. g. 192.168.1.2 (gateway and DNS is not required).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Plugin the power.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Connect via serial<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Wait until the following messages is passing: Press the [f] key and hit [enter] to enter failsafe mode<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Press &quot;f&quot; and the &quot;enter&quot; key<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You should be able to telnet (not SSH) to the router at 192.168.1.1 now (no username and password)</p><br /><p>I don&#039;t know how to &quot;connect via serial&quot;.&nbsp; Almost every pc in my house runs linux, though my son has an old windows laptop on which he plays minecraft.&nbsp; So:&nbsp; If someone oculd walk me through how to establish a serial connection I&#039;d be really grateful!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Matt</p>									</div>

					<p>You will need a 3.3 volt serial converter.&nbsp; Most of these connect to a PC by USB, so they can be used with any modern PC.</p><p>Once you have the necessary hardware, you will have to open the case of the router and do some soldering to connect it.&nbsp; The picture of the board in the wiki shows that the serial port connection is near the RAM chip and WPS button.&nbsp; It is the line of 4 empty holes.&nbsp; The hole with a square copper pad is pin 1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks mk24.&nbsp; Your answer was sufficiently terrifying to me that I carefully reread the failsafe page, searched some more on the forums, and managed to get into reset mode (by pressing the hardware buttons over and over for about 75 seconds!). From there I could connect over ethernet and was able to repair my botched config files.&nbsp; </p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>
