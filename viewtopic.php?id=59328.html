					<p>I have a Gl.Inet with trunk running on perfect on it. I&#039;m planning using it as a travel router, so the question is: wired wan is ok, but many times we have access only to wireless when travelling, so is possible to have 2 wan interfaces ( wired and wireless) and simple choose/connect/use which is available?<br />anyone had experience with such config?</p><p>Thanks and regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>@petiso<br />good question about having WAN+WWAN. I also experienced difficulties with it myself.

					<p>@petiso - From what I understand, the gl.inet <strong>software</strong> is only a GUI on top of OpenWRT BB 14.07 <strong>firmware</strong> and a simplified alternative to Luci.&nbsp; I expect that they have built some additional functionality into the GUI, and add their packages to OpneWRT for USB camera etc.</p><p>Have you made any headway on your basic config issue?</p>									</div>
