					<p>Now I can confirm that LEDE is an excellent functional OpenWRT alternative for this router V4, I have been using it for a couple of days, and it works very very well, and it is very stable, I have not seen any bug. I highly recommend it.</p>									</div>

					<p>From performance point of view, I noticed the following:</p><p>I have a V1 and a V4 version of this router.
