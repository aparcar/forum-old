					<p>Yep, I&#039;ve been doing that all day long.

					<p>Since you weren&#039;t clear -- did you reboot the router at the end of the upgrade procedure or did you wait for it to reboot on your own? Which exact OpenWrt image are you using to flash?

					<p>Great work, keyboardgnome. Thanks for your research.

					<p>Yes I have a modern manufactured 1/16/2016 Archer C7 v2 that is currently using the DD trunk build. I even wrote a handy script <a href="https://opsech.io/posts/2016/Mar/24/bootstrapping-openwrt-sysupgrade-snapshots.html">here</a> to help bootstrap the sysupgrade process, because DD doesn&#039;t come with ath10k firmware or LuCI installed. (could that be your problem? You maybe didn&#039;t realize that and aren&#039;t SSHing in first and installing those things?)</p><p>I&#039;m not going to go through the TFTP procedure because it&#039;s a pretty ubiquitous and detailed thing elsewhere. A key thing for me was setting up: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tcpdump -n port tftp</code></pre></div><p> on the TFTP server to view its request. That&#039;s when you know it&#039;s actually working.</p><p>I recall having a bootloop as I was messing around with things and I could still get the TFTP to work by holding down the reset button after I turning the power switch on. Just wait for the &#039;double WPS arrows&#039; to display, then let go of the reset button, then look for the TFTP request on your tcpdump output. It takes about 2 seconds after the WPS light is solid for the request to be made. </p><p>I might have some other information that&#039;s of use to you (like serial output logs of various scenarios, because I did take the time to solder that on and hook it up to a UART) so I encourage you to look at my post history. </p><p>In the end, they key to getting things to work on the new C7 was using DD instead of CC because it includes support for the new chip in the kernel. Without it, horrible things happen. (It really just boots and does nothing, but you can still TFTP!)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xenith</strong> on 25 Mar 2016, 17:59)</p>

At least on the firmware version I have on my Archer C7 V2 (3.14.3 Build 151014 Rel.49676n) it won&#039;t allow me to use the WebUI to restore the older firmware version. Did you have to use the tftp method or something else?</p>									</div>
