					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a wrt54gs v5.1 router and it&#039;s bricked. I&#039;ve tried everything but I couldn&#039;t rewrite the image. These are the simptoms:<br />Power led flashed about 4-5 times per second.<br />The router responds to pings.<br />First I&#039;ve tried to do the normal reset. Nothing happened.<br />Then I&#039;ve done the 30/30/30 reset.Still nothing.<br />It was surprising that the DHCP server worked perfectly.<br />I&#039;ve tried to TFTP a new image, but everytime i got a &quot;No response&quot;. I&#039;ve scanned the ports with nmap and 69 UDP was always closed, even though the ping worked and also the DHCP.<br />Also when trying to access the router via HTTP I got the Firmware Management Page. I&#039;ve also tried uploading it that way, but it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>Is there anything else I could try ?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Nihilistar</p>									</div>
