					<p>I have recently added an SD card to my Linksys AP (WRT54GL v1.1).&nbsp; Followed the how-to and everything went great (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ys/WRT54GL</a>).&nbsp; Thanks to those that put that together.&nbsp; I am able to mount and read/write the SD and also have the init scripts set up to load the mmc module and mount the card on reboot (assuming the card is plugged in of course).</p><p>Now I am trying to get hotplugging to work.&nbsp; I tried by creating /etc/hotplug.d/mmc/01-mmc-storage but when I insert/remove the card nothing happens.&nbsp; My 01-mmc-storage file is executable and currently just looks like:</p><p>echo &quot;mmc hotplug&quot; &gt;&gt; /root/LOG</p><br /><p>I know that won&#039;t mount the thing, I am just trying to verify that I get an event, which I don&#039;t.&nbsp; I tried following&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Software/WifiToggle">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Cus … WifiToggle</a>&nbsp; to set up a button hotplug event script so I created&nbsp; /etc/hotplug.d/button/01-radio-toggle&nbsp; and added a simple echo command to that script.&nbsp; Pressing the button does not trigger that one either.</p><p>When I boot I notice that the button/01-radio-toggle DOES get called a bunch of times...but won&#039;t get called after bootup.&nbsp; In both cases the mmc/01-mmc-storage does not get called.&nbsp; So what has to happen for hotplug to get called?&nbsp; Maybe it has something to do with my gpiomask (0x9c).&nbsp; Does that disable hotplug events or something?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I&#039;m just missing a step here.&nbsp; I&#039;d appreciate your help.</p><p>I&#039;m running OpenWrt 2.4.34.&nbsp; I got the image from&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm-2.4/openwrt-wrt54g-2.4-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7 … uashfs.bin</a></p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I have an update to my issue.&nbsp; I edited /etc/hotplug.d/button/01-radio-toggle to just have:</p><p>echo &quot;toggle hotplug&quot;</p><p>I don&#039;t switch on &quot;$BUTTON&quot; = &quot;ses&quot; but rather just print the test message if the 01-radio-toggle gets called at all.&nbsp; What I&#039;ve found is that I don&#039;t get an event on the Secure Easy Setup button (&quot;ses&quot;) but I DO get an event on the reset button.&nbsp; Still not sure how to get an event for SD card insert/remove.</p>									</div>

					<p>I still haven&#039;t&nbsp; sorted this out.&nbsp; I am trying to understand how to get a hotplug event to trigger when I plug in an SD card and I haven&#039;t found any documentation on how the OpenWRT hotplug stuff works.&nbsp; From what I can tell the kernel calls /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug&nbsp; which calls /sbin/hotplug-call which then calls the appropriate handler script in /etc/hotplug.d/$1/* where $1 can be &#039;button&#039; or &#039;usb&#039;, etc.</p><p>SO, it looks like I need the kernel to make the hotplug call and pass &#039;mmc&#039; or something like that so that /etc/hotplug.d/mmc/* gets called.&nbsp; Plugging and unplugging the SD card does not result in /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug getting called so of course it never gets anywhere else.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Do I need to set up an interrupt handler or something on GPIO 2,3,4 or 7 that does something like&nbsp; &nbsp;cat /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug mmc&nbsp; &nbsp;or something like that to get things going?&nbsp; I&#039;d appreciate any input on this.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m thinking that the SD driver module may be the one responsible for generating the hotplug event.&nbsp; So I looked at the mmc.c source and I see that the mmc_timer part is commented out.&nbsp; I believe that is the timer that occasionally fires and checks for a device.&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case then this driver currently is not checking.&nbsp; I wonder why it was left out.&nbsp; When the timer fires it is supposed to call mmc_check_media which does the detection and a hotplug call could be added here.</p><p>Any thoughts on why the timer was disabled or if my plan of action doesn&#039;t make sense?&nbsp; Clearly I&#039;m new to the whole hotplug thing.&nbsp; I am going to try to get it working again.</p>									</div>
