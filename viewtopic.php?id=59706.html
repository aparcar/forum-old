					<p>Hi,<br />I just flashed the openWRT 12.09 firmware on my old Netgear DG834G v3 and it is very slow especially the web interface. Hence, it is very difficult to configure the various parameters: in particular, I would like to setup the WiFi interface as first thing.<br />Moreover, if it is possible I would like to setup Client Mode Wireless <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode</a> and in particular a WDS in which this router should act as Access Point WDS while another router should act as Client WDS. How can I configure my router?<br />Thank you</p>									</div>
