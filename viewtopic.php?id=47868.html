					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve spent half a day on this problem and I&#039;ve given up. I have 2 routers: Router A in the garage with the internet connection and Router B sitting on my TV unit. Router A has the internet connection in its WAN port and has its first LAN port plugged into Router B&#039;s LAN port. The previous configuration was quite easy.... Give Router A and Router B their own static IP address, turn off DHCP on Router B then setup identical wireless networks on them. I verify this setup by toggling each router&#039;s wireless link and watching my wireless device&#039;s signal.</p><p>I&#039;ve now put OpenWRT on both routers (they&#039;re identical TP-Link WDR-4300) but can&#039;t for the life of me get the wireless networks working together. I&#039;m using inSSIDer and it&#039;s giving me different results with the OpenWRT routers&#039; wireless setup compared to my TP Link.</p><p>Router A has: <strong>Access Point</strong> selected, and <strong>lan</strong> networks selected.<br />Router B has: <strong>Access Point</strong> selected and <strong>lan</strong> and <strong>wan</strong> networks selected.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what else to play with to get it working. They have the same SSID, different channels, automatically set Transmit Power. Both are defaulting to Master mode and the web GUI is showing signal strength on Router A as 100% and Router B as 0%.</p><p>I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve botched up the Mode and Network settings. Would someone be able to assist me?</p><br /><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>What is the exact issue you are facing? Different resultswith inSSIDer means you are not able to achieve the similar RSSI values?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve opened inSSIDer and can see the two wireless networks with the same SSID. One is channel 6 and the other channel 11. I note which one my laptop is connected to then turn that router off to verify the application correctly displays the network I&#039;m connected to. That works fine... I see channel 6 go down and the laptop switches to channel 11. However, I walk the laptop to the other side of the house where the signal is significantly weaker but it doesn&#039;t switch to the stronger signal. The weak signal is -59 and the stronger one is -29.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lamanna19</strong> on 16 Dec 2013, 12:22)</p>

					<p>In my experiences, the switch won&#039;t happen automatically. Once the laptop connects it stops searching for any other APs. The only way to achieve the switch is to disconnect and reconnect.</p>									</div>

					<p>Switching (roaming) is totally depend on your laptop, AP may not have a role to play in there. Were u using different channels or same channels before flashing openwrt? Try putting both APs to same channel and see if it solve the issue.</p>									</div>
