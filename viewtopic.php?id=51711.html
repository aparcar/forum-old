					<p>Well, obviously RC1&#039;s packages are only built from the new packages feed. I believe this is completely intentional to get people to assume maintainership of packages and/or move them to the new feed. In fact it may the trunk build that is off, <a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2014-June/025950.html">it actually shouldn&#039;t contain oldpackages either</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Its not a suicide, more an aggressive attempt to free up developer resources. We&#039;re swamped with tickets and support requests for thousands of packages we have no ability to test or verify. Packages claimed by people are getting moved to github and will be maintained there.</p><p>Right now there are about 750 (source-)packages left in oldpackages which have not been taken care of. If no one steps up to maintain them they&#039;ll eventually not get built by OpenWrt.org anymore. The Makefiles etc. remain in the repository so people can continue building them privately or setup custom binary repos.</p><p>We also invested some effort to brush up the SDK which will be released along with BB - this will allow people to build binary compatible packages for this specific release.</p><p>The old packages will be built once more and made available for the final release, after that the repository will remain frozen and not receive any updates anymore.</p>									</div>

					<p>For the lazy and crazy ones like me: you can simply point opkg to the snapshot url and (try to) install the old packages (ones with a dependency on the kernel need to be forced because the kernel package version is slightly different).<br />This way I managed to install miniupnpd and 6to4 and they work properly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, I need to ask. Since today we have the RC2 build (although never announced in here or on the mailing list). And it lacks packages that have been moved to Github well over a month ago, let alone those that went on Github in the last days (which are quite a lot). What&#039;s going on there?</p><p>I&#039;m also a bit confused as to what happens when a package just misses the release build date. Does that mean the release build will stay on the (frozen) oldpackage version of that package? Or will it be added to the packages feed retroactively?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 30 Jul 2014, 02:58)</p>
