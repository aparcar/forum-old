					<p>Hi there. I&#039;d like to announce Shairport Sync, a version of Shairport with audio synchronisation.</p><p>Shairport emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of streaming audio from iTunes and compatible iPods and iPhones.</p><p>This new version of Shairport – &quot;Shairport Sync&quot; – adds audio synchronisation: the audio output stays in sync with the source and with other AirPlay devices – it doesn&#039;t drift in and out of sync, so it&#039;s good for multi-speaker or multi-room audio. It has a few other improvements too – overall, it&#039;s a bit more &quot;housetrained&quot;.</p><p>Built and tested against trunk for the Raspberry Pi and the [ancient but still useful] Linksys NSLU2 and with a variety of USB audio output devices – an original iMic, a &quot;3D Sound&quot; card, a Topping TP30 amplifier, the Raspberry Pi&#039;s built-in sound card.</p><p>At this stage, it seems pretty robust. I&#039;d appreciate any feedback.</p><p>It&#039;s at: <a href="https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport">https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport</a></p>									</div>
