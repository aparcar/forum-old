					<p>I am looking for a bit of help to whittle down all the choices. This is not a one-shot purchase. I am setting up a WISP in Guatemala and I am looking for something with the following characteristics.<br /></p><ul><li><p>Solid hardware</p></li><li><p>Runs OpenWrt</p></li><li><p>Easy to flash</p></li><li><p>Popular enough to be easy to buy</p></li><li><p>Inexpensive</p></li><li><p>Has WiFi and 4 or more router ports</p></li></ul><p>The equipment is for customer use. The feed will use some Ubiquiti radio (which depends on the link) but the data rates the router must handle will be relatively low. Thus, no need for anything high performance. 100Mb Ethernet ports are fine. I have a D-Link DIR-615 here running OpenWrt and have no issues with it but am not sure &quot;it&#039;s the best&quot; for what I want to do.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
