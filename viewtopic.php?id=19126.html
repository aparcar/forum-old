					<p>I took the SL that ran the first Kaloz image of OpenWRT, and attempted a RAM upgrade.</p><p>I had a 512-meg SODIMM with Samsung K4H511638C-UCB3.&nbsp; This is a 512-Megabit chip and looks pin-compatible with Hynix except for maybe pin19.&nbsp; Anyhow I managed to get a RAM chip off the SODIMM the first time without much problem, following the video previously posted.</p><p>I was thinking to remove the original SL RAM and replace with this one, giving a 64-megabyte SL without having to mess with 20 SMD resistors.&nbsp; If that worked perhaps move on to putting on resistors and a 2nd RAM chip and see if it would go to 128 megabytes.</p><p>Next was removing RAM on SL unit. Unfortunately I used too much prying force on the chip and perhaps too much heat, several solder pads came up with it.</p>									</div>
