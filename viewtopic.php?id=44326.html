					<p>Hi all</p><p>First off all, let me start to say that I am new at this so I hope my questions are not considered stupid. </p><p>I want to create my own personal VPN. I live in the U.S. and would like to connect to my family&#039;s network in Europe so it appears that I am connected from a EU IP address. I have tried several VPN services online and they are mostly good, but I really want a 100 % personal IP address because of specific reasons.</p><p>1) How is this possible? I was recommended to do this via a router that supports OpenWrt? I have never even heard of it before, thats why I&#039;m asking in here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Is it a hard process?</p><p>2) Would this be a reliable solution? My line in the U.S is 20/10 mbit, while the one in Europe is 3/1 mbit. How would this compare to lets say HideMyAss or other providers? I guess they have stronger servers, but at the same time they have a lot of people connected to the same servers.</p><p>Help would be very much appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not 100% current with the latest goings-on in OpenWRT but I&#039;ve done a number of OpenWRT /w VPN installs in the last few years.</p><p>1) Don&#039;t expect this to be point and click - you&#039;ll have to install the OpenWRT f/w (obviously) and then a VPN package. I have most experience with OpenVPN so based on that there may be a little bit of messing around - you&#039;ll have to decide if you want to bridge your networks (using a tap interface) or whether you just want to join two separate networks with a routed link (tun interface).&nbsp; If you just want a single host in the US to appear in Europe then you&#039;ll be fine with a routed (tun) setup (it&#039;ll also be a little more bandwidth efficient since it sends encapsulated IP packets and not encapsulated Ethernet packets).&nbsp; A lot of the config complexity will come from the setup of OpenVPN itself (ciphers, client topologies, ccd, key exchange procotols etc, and you may have to mess around with MTU values).&nbsp; Windows XP (if that is what your host is) then goes out of its way to complicate routing over the VPN.&nbsp; </p><p>It works and it&#039;s not impossible, but you do have to know a little about networking.<br />See:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.overview">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.overview</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.server.openvpn.tun">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.s … penvpn.tun</a></p><p>2) I run OpenVPN tunnels on OpenWRT between offices 24/7 and generally haven&#039;t had any reliability issues - the biggest problem is the lifetime of the router as they are mostly home routers and give up the ghost after a year or two.&nbsp; I also have OpenVPN on Windows XP to a big linux VPN server also working great for road warriors.<br />Regarding speed - hidemyass etc.. have servers on big pipes near the core - your VPN server will be on a 3/1 link on a home connection - your maximum theoretical (assuming the router performance isn&#039;t the bottleneck, and it could be, depending on model) speed would be 1/1 mbit (since that uplink is the bottleneck in the tromboning of traffic).</p><p>If you are looking for more speed then you might have a look at the Kimsufi range of servers from OVH - I host a few VPNs for clients there - they&#039;re located in France, but there may be options to host in other countries also.&nbsp; 100/100 mbit so your maximum theoretical performance would be 20/10 mbit because of the speed of your US link.</p><p>Good luck. Perhaps someone else can give you a more current answer.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any luci packages for any vpn in the 12.09 package directories so I&#039;m guessing the VPNs are still configured by hand.</p><p>EDIT: The reason I went with OpenVPN is because it is multi-platform (Win,Linux,Mac) and because it doesn&#039;t use any special IP packet types, just UDP or TCP (and not GRE), so it&#039;ll pass unhindered through most firewalls.&nbsp; In the very very very worst case (I once had this when I was at Telefonica R&amp;D - their corporate firewall blocks (or at least did a few years ago) EVERYTHING but WWW) you can run OpenVPN on port 443 (HTTPS port) over TCP (using TCP isn&#039;t ideal though: <a href="http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html">http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html</a> ).&nbsp; I would recommend running OpenVPN UDP if you know it works.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jsp</strong> on 22 May 2013, 16:58)</p>

					<p>I do something similar from Australia to the US (when I need a US address). However, my endpoint in the US is an OpenBSD VPS, but it could just as easily be an OpenWrt machine. </p><p>If you want all your traffic to appear from Europe, you&#039;ll need to make sure all your traffic is sent over the VPN (if using OpenVPN, see the &quot;redirect-gateway def1&quot; option). Then, on the endpoint, you&#039;ll need to enable forwarding and NAT the VPN traffic before it heads out. </p><p>NAT could be done on another router, but that router will need to have a route for the VPN network, to the machine the VPN terminates on. </p><p>You should be able to do all this using Windows.</p>									</div>

YMMV</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jsp</strong> on 25 May 2013, 20:37)</p>
