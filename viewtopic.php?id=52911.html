					<p>Hello,</p><p>In the other day I realized I already have a lot of devices connected to my home network.</p><p>Stuff like IPcams, smartphones, TV, media center, computers, tablets, printers, virtual machines, NAS, RPIs, etc. More than 20 devices accessing the internet!</p><p>When most of these devices connect to the internet, I don&#039;t even know where they are connecting to. I suspect specially of the chinese IP cams I have bought from ebay. I mean, since its based on a small linux box (similar to openwrt, but closed development), it could easily have some malware and send critical information over to the internet, right?</p><p>Anyway, I was thinking in having a loging function in my openwrt router that could log all of the accesses coming from the LAN.</p><p>Something simple like:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Date | Device name or IP (from) | Accessed URL name or IP (to) | Protocol (TCP or UDP) | Port</p></blockquote></div><p>The system should already have something that does this because I can see on the web GUI the Current Real time Sessions, so it should be a matter of writing every new session on a file...</p><p>I don&#039;t have storage problems as I&#039;m using a 16GB USB stick on the router. Nevertheless, I could also send every now and then the log files to a NAS.</p><p>I found what I believe its a <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28547">similar post</a>, but it seems its based on some package (dsniff) that I couldn&#039;t find in Attitude Adjustment.</p><p>So, I&#039;d like to ask:</p><p>What would be the easiest way of achieving this objective?<br />Would the way of doing it in the mentioned post would work? How to get the missing package (dsniff)?</p><p>Any ideas, suggestions?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jabss</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jabss</strong> on 24 Sep 2014, 17:02)</p>

					<p>Perfect working @jabss. It captured all internet activity done from my android phone connected to my openwrt router. But i found that when i connected my iphone to it, it didnt work. The iphone was using internet successfully, but my router couldn&#039;t show even a single url. Same time it was showing Android or router&#039;s its own request URLs also. <br />Can you help me to solve this issue?<br />It would be great if you can help me to sort out this.</p>									</div>
