					<p>I just got my Huawei E3272 3/4G dongle working with OpenWrt and noticed that it only uses its 3G connection. When using the dongle with my desktop I am able to connect via 3G Ã¡nd LTE. After some research I found out that 4G uses a different protocol than 3G which currently is not implemented in OpenWrt. I did find the ROOTer Project at <a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com">http://ofmodemsandmen.com</a>, but I prefer to use an as clean as possible version of OpenWrt. Aside from that, there are people who managed to get LTE working on just OpenWrt if you look at this threads:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41945">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=41945</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42136">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42136</a></p><p>I would like to achieve this as well but at the moment I can&#039;t get my hands on how they managed to get LTE working. If anyone knows how I can get LTE working on OpenWrt, I would be very thankful!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>koningh</strong> on 26 Sep 2014, 12:32)</p>
