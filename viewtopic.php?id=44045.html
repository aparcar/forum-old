					<p><strong>EDIT: Use <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39581">this</a> original thread for replies/testing-results!</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39581">Linksys E1000v1</a> (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e1000">wiki</a>) is currently working with OpenWrt, with an &quot;alpha&quot; quality.</p><p>It is identical in hardware to the Linksys WRT160Nv3 and the Cisco Valet M10v1.</p><p>In other words, it is working for the most part, but still has some issues. It would be great if people can find and fix these issues, so the router can be &quot;beta&quot;-quality and even &quot;release&quot;-quality. For now you can get away with a custom build (which is what I am doing for now), but if it works out of the box, then many more people can use this and benefit from this.</p><p>Please write (like in a bug report):<br/>&nbsp; - The model of router used<br/>&nbsp; - The revision of the build (can find it <a href="http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/builders/brcm47xx">here</a>) if using a trunk snapshot, or the build info (.config file, patches etc. if applicable) if you are using a custom build</p><br/><p>To start off: Here are some issues found so far, testing on E1000...<br/>&nbsp; - On current trunk <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/">snapshots</a>, Luci cannot be installed (using &quot;luci&quot; package), since there is not enough free space on the router. Possible solutions: Select &quot;bgmac&quot; ethernet driver profile in image builder or source build; Compile a custom image with unneeded code removed; Install only Luci dependencies which are absolutely required; add code to trunk to generate a custom image <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate#profiles">profile</a> for the router(s) with any unneeded items removed<br/>&nbsp; - Possible issues with wireless -- some devices may not connect (should be fixed now, with <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=199991#p199991">the GPIO fix</a>, but I may have seen this problem in very recent builds), may disable wired ethernet ports when enabled (though I am pretty sure this is fixed with the GPIO fix). Possible solutions: compile with older revision from soon after GPIO fix was applied (I have been doing so)<br/>&nbsp; - The &quot;.bin&quot;&nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/openwrt-e1000_v1_v2-squashfs.bin">image</a> for the E1000 is rejected by the stock web-interface. Possible solutions: fix the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/header">BIN</a> file (can compare the header to the stock firmware, if that is legal, or just do it manually.)<br/>&nbsp; - Multiple (simultaneous) SSIDs in AP mode are not working for me, when I enable one of them, then both don&#039;t work. I think the hardware can support this (&quot;software interface modes (can always be added):\n\t* AP/VLAN)&quot;, though I do not know for a fact; here is output from &quot;iw list&quot; :<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Wiphy phy0
