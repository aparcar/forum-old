					<p>i have also been trying to get this to work. i tried both the nocatsplash 0.92 that comes with the white russian release and the 0.93pre2 ipk from sderle (nocat.net), but both don&#039;t seem to work with remote url splash. i am sure the ipk from sderle is compiled with the &#039;--with-remote-splash&#039; option. i&#039;ve configured the appropiate options in /etc/nocat.conf, but when i run splashd it always says it got the static splash page and when testing it will serve the static splash.</p><p>the reason i want to have a remote splash is because i want the splash page to contain some haserl code and the static splash doesn&#039;t seem to work with that. i thought i&#039;d redirect to the httpd that runs on openwrt itself and have that serve the splash page.</p><p>if someone could enlighten me, i&#039;d appreciate it. i must be doing something wrong coz i can&#039;t find much info on this and i don&#039;t think i am the only one wanting to use this function. so it&#039;s probably not broken or i&#039;d see more people asking questions about it.</p>									</div>
