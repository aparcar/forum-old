With the full buildroot, just run &quot;make menuconfig&quot; and choose your options.&nbsp; I think I will run a build just to generate a squashfs with a base package set that includes what I want. I like squashfs for safety, but I do not need PPPOE modules, etc.&nbsp; You would probably want the SDK though I think if all you want is generating a few packages. The two tar files in nbd directory are the ones he used I think, or you could use SVN to pull your own.</p><p>Today my cellular cable is not working, but I think I might have damaged it accidentally <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>As for 12V power, I have used a cheap Radio-Shack adapter that goes from 12V-lighter-plug to M-connector seems to work fine. I don&#039;t know if the voltage regulator inside the WRT units is rated for the &quot;dirty&quot; power present in automotive electrical systems though. I know from prior studies that it can handle a very wide voltage range, but I don&#039;t know how it would handle the constant variance of this input source. Generally I used my adapter to power from a 12V jumper-pack unit for on-site usage where no power was present, I have not done sustained in-car usage with engine running. I will check with my brother who is an electronics whiz but I suspect it would be fine for quite a long while, maybe add a fuse inline for safety.</p><p>What&#039;s your project about?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 8 Mar 2006, 20:03)</p>

					<p>Copying a post from broadbandreports.com Linksys forum, by user bbarrett:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br />think there is JTAG on the board in some fashion. &quot;JTAG&quot; is silkscreened next to a group of resistors in at least two locations on the bottom side of the board. But I do not see a header for it anywhere. Perhaps there isn&#039;t a connector, because it&#039;s accessible only via a bed-of-nails test fixture.</p><p>JP4 appears to be a serial port (CMOS 3.3V signaling, no RS-232 line driver). Pin 1 is 3.3V, and Pin 5 is Ground. Pin 2 has 115.2kbps output, so it is RxD. Pin 3 appears to be TxD (there is a visible trace connected to it). Pin 4 seems to be unused, but might have a function I&#039;m unaware of. I&#039;ve not had the time to make a 232 driver board and see what&#039;s on the port--I just probed with a scope and multimeter. But I&#039;m sure it&#039;s the CFE bootloader.</p><p>JP3 also has 3.3V at pin 1, Ground at pin 5, and traces connected to pins 2 and 3. There is no visible output on pin 2. Nonetheless, I suspect it&#039;s a 2nd serial port.</p><p>By the way, did anyone notice that the board will support two antennae? And that LED10 is not populated--a spare GPIO for 1-Wire or other hacking...</p>									</div>
