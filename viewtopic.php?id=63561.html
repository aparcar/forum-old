					<p>The patch has been applied to the mainline linux kernel in the meantime. But it has not been backported to the stable kernels 3.18 and 4.1 which OpenWrt Chaos Calmer and trunk use. The official stable kernel trees only accept patches/backports for real issue. A harmless log message won&#039;t be fixed in stable kernels.</p><p>Now, you could still ask the OpenWrt devs to include a patch in their source trees. But it seems like a lot of effort for something that is only a cosmetic issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks silentcreek,<br />that&#039;s a perfectly reasonable explanation.</p><p>I assumed that patch had been accepted into stable/trunk as the patch had been &#039;signed off&#039;. <br />apparently getting a patch accepted is a little more complicated, </p><p>i learned something new today, thanks for that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
