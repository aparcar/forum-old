					<p>So, I&#039;ve been using these builds with my WNDR3800 for a while now (Thanks hnyman for providing them!).&nbsp; Recently my internet was upgraded to 300 Mbps down, but I&#039;m only able to get around 200 Mbps through the router (with a computer directly connected to the modem, I get 300 Mbps no problem.&nbsp; Same computer attached directly to router with Cat6 cable only gets 200 Mbps). Currently running Chaos Calmer r45194 (was running an older build of Barrier Breaker with same problem and upgraded to see if it helped). QOS is turned off.&nbsp; Only non-standard software from this build that I&#039;m running is unbound.&nbsp; </p><p>Has anybody else been able to get 300 Mbps with OpenWRT/these builds on their N600s?&nbsp; According to smallnetbuilder.com&#039;s router charts, the WNDR3800 should be able to do 335.3 Mbps WAN to LAN (and WNDR3700v2 should be able to do over 400 Mbps).&nbsp; </p><p>Are there any tweaks that I can do to try to get better speed?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>_tuuk</strong> on 7 Apr 2015, 07:32)</p>
