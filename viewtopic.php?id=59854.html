					<p>I just upgraded my main OpenWRT box to find that the SANE stuff I had from 14.09 is missing from repos.<br />My box is also acting as a printserver and a scanner server with its two USB ports.<br />The printing part is working thanks to the p910n package. But the scanners are gone.</p><p>In particular I am talking about mpc85xx architecture and these packages:</p><p>sane-backends_1.0.24-1_mpc85xx.ipk<br />sane-frontends_1.0.24-1_mpc85xx.ipk<br />sane-libs_1.0.24-1_mpc85xx.ipk</p><p>I understand that they were in the &quot;oldpackages&quot; subdir of the repo and they were in a &quot;phase out&quot; status.<br />Nonetheless I&#039;d like to recompile (or possibly reuse?) those packages.<br />Any idea on where to pull the sources from?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m also missing the sane packages for 15.05. Fortunately I realised it before upgrading. </p><p>It seems the GitHub user &quot;luizluca&quot; has seen into it and submitted a patch that brings back sane packages in an even better form: divided into individual packages for each backend so we should be able to use sane with far less free flash memory. see: <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/1799">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/1799</a></p><p>Does anyone know if this commit will result in prebuilt sane packages for 15.05 anytime soon?</p>									</div>
