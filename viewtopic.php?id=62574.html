					<p>Hi</p><p>I own an old Topcom Skyr@cer WBR 7101gmr that I would like to repurpose and experiment with. The hardware is not that common and is not in the list with supported hardware (neither are other topcom&#039;s for that matter)</p><p>I opened the box and started looking for chips hoping I could find a similar (supported) model, so I could try that firmware.<br />The CPU is RDC R3211-G<br />Wifi chipset Ralink RT2661T<br />Realtec RTL8305SC switch</p><p>Are other chips important? What should I look for?</p><p>How can I easily identify a similar model?</p><p>Did someone have any luck with a topcom router?</p><p>Kind regards</p>									</div>
