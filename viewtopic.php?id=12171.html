					<p>I have a WRT54G version 1.1.<br />I bought it a while ago, and bricked it, at least I thought so.</p><p>Today I connected it again to my network and thought using it as a switch. The WLAN-led lit up, and I was so curious that I had my real router (buffalo whr-g54s with DD-wrt) to scan for Wlans. And guess what - it found it!</p><p>I connected a network cable to the LAN ports on the WRT54G. No response to ping.<br />I flashed it with Linksys stock firmware, WRT54GV4.0_4.21.1_US_code.</p><p>After flashing it I tried pinging the LAN and WAN (internet) port. On the WAN-port it responds nicely to 192.168.1.1.<br />It works to configure it etc, but the own firmware is quite limited.<br />I do not have any WAN-interface either on it either, the LAN doesn&#039;t work as WAN.</p><p>I tried resetting it with the resetbutton (turning off the unit, pressing the button, turning power back on, holding it down for 10 seconds and then releasing it). That didn&#039;t solve the problem, the stuff I entered in the webinterface just disappeared.<br />I tried the reset-function in the webinterface too, but it doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>I tried installing openwrt and dd-wrt to it, but I cannot access the configurator from any port. If I put the linksys firmware back in, it works as it did before.</p><p>I remember playing with the VLAN:s a long time ago. Probably messed up something there.<br />Is there any way to fix this?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Macce</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Macce</strong> on 20 Aug 2007, 19:14)</p>
