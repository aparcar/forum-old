					<p>I am having problems with kernel 4.4 as well here with my WRT1200AC, I am pretty sure it has to do with how USB storage is handled. When I boot without any USB devices connected, everything boots fine and reboots are prefectly fine as well, but when I attach my external 2TB USB 3.0 drive or a USB stick with lots of data on it, it won&#039;t boot correctly after a reset/powerdown most of the time. Disconnect the storage, and it boots fine.</p>									</div>
