					<p>Whenever I tried to compile a package, buildroot goes through the process to re-compile all the dependencies (which already had been successfully compiled in previous compilation a few minutes ago) that take along time before starting to compile the package I intend to compile. Is there a way to disable this?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can&#039;t &quot;switch off&quot; compilation of dependencies per se.
