					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m new to the custom router firmware scene and I&#039;m looking for some help. My goal in installing this firmware is to set up SQM to help with latency while playing games on my PC. I just installed OpenWRT on my ~4yo RT-N56U and I&#039;ve made some progress setting it up using the default Web interface but I&#039;ve run into 2 problems. So the problems are:</p><p>1. I set up the 5GHz radio and am able to connect to it and get internet, but the connection is very spotty. The Ping test with command prompt shows that my connection to the router is frequently cutting out for many seconds a a time. Wired is fine.</p><p>2. I measured my Internet connection (with wired) at dslreports.com and got 30Mbits down and 6Mbits up with high bufferbloat. Then I installed luci-app-sqm and enabled it. Initially, i set both UL and DL limits to 25000kbits. Then I ran a speed test and it worked as expected: 25Mbits down with low bufferbloat, 6Mbits up with high bufferbloat. The problem is that if I set UL to 5000kbits (a reasonable number for my connection I think), my DL drops to 5Mbits and my UL is at about 2-3Mbits.</p><p>Notes:<br />I currently have the router sitting right next to my computer for testing, but its final location will be a couple meters away in an adjacent room.<br />I left most of the wireless settings at default. All I changed was adding a password and setting the connection type to US with a target range of 4 meters.</p><p>Please let me know if there is any additional information that would be useful to you. Thank for any help you can give me!<br />-Ben</p>									</div>
