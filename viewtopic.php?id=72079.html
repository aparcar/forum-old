					<p>I have been compiling images for OpenWRT for nearly five years but hit a brick wall today trying to upload code to a piece of hardware that is supposedly a WIP.</p><p>I am dealing with a serial connected U-Boot session on a Buffalo LS421DE. I have several compiled images from the current DD trunk but it seems that everything is compressed as a tarball...</p><p>Decompressing the tarball ( tar -xvf openwrt*.tar) I am left with files labeled CONTROL, root, and kernel. </p><p>What I need is a zImage to run through mkimage to get a uImage for U-Boot or a way to get a compiled uImage.</p><p>I have no idea what file compression I am dealing with after the tarball... In the V=s output from the compilation I see multiple mentions of a uImage being made or manipulated but I have no idea where to go looking for it or what sequence of decompression steps that need to be taken in order to extract it.</p><p>Is there some odd directory where just the raw uImage or zImage goes before compression is applied to it?</p><p>Thanks... Any input is welcome.</p>									</div>
