					<p>Hi everybody!</p><p>I&#039;ve just flashed my <strong>TP-Link MR3420 hardware v1.0</strong> with the precompiled OpenWrt trunk r32130 (no web interface, installed luci after flashing via opkg) as stated in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3420">wiki</a>. Now I just recalled that on my TP-Link WR703n, which I flashed after <a href="http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Install_OpenWRT_on_TPlink_WR703N">this step-by-step guide</a>, the <em>restorefactory</em> got installed too. I didn&#039;t find a clear statement about what the <em>restorefactory</em> in fact does (from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#reset.button">this wiki post</a> I assume it adds the &quot;default&quot; reset button capability that a normal user would assume to the reset button). </p><p>Now my question is: for my TP-Link MR3420, the wiki seems to say that the failsafe mode does <span class="bbu">not</span> work by any means. Do I get that correctly? What does this mean in detail - what am I <span class="bbu">not</span> able to do in case I mess up my device, e.g. by configuring it wrong or filling up the complete disk space? Is it advised to install <em>restorefactory</em>, and what will it bring for my device? </p><p>Just want to understand more than I currently do <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thx!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>_F_</strong> on 21 Aug 2012, 02:21)</p>
