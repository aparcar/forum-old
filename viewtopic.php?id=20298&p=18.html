					<p>Hi all , Im totaly new in this forum (except reading this thread <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)&nbsp; <br />I have one , little off-topic exploration (maybe someone explore it before me , but i do not notice it) <br />Problem with long dku-5 cable (possibli FTDI chips ,thei have worst signal reception) to serial port :<br />Reason is in power supply ,default supplied in box is switching (or pulse) based (sorry about my english ,i hope the point will be clear). That producing a lot of interferences which in this case kicking some ugli stuff into RX/TX transmission. <br />So , I take another linksys power supply from older model ,based on transformer and now i got a clear serial console <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> (on about one meter cable)<br />Now i going to explore this device about handling a stuff that i&#039;d like to put it in <br />Nice work here btw <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>calltrace</strong> on 23 Dec 2009, 14:09)</p>

					<p>I meant to edit the config files directly. It is (at least for me) an easier way to see the whole picture and you don&#039;t have to worry about &quot;uci commit&quot; (i always forget).<br /><em>here is my working wpa2 client only config.</em><br />Edit3: here is my semi-working wpa2 client only mode confi : / it was working for 10-20 minutes then suddenly stopped.<br />Edit2: i forgot that i had to create /var/run/ on boot so that the auto setup of wpa_supplicant doesn&#039;t complain.<br />@grymoire: i realize this isn&#039;t quite what you&#039;re looking for but if you change the mode to &quot;ap&quot; from &quot;sta&quot; it should work fine if you ignore my network configs, but i haven&#039;t tested yet so i&#039;m not sure. you might need to change &quot;key ...&quot; to &quot;passphrase ...&quot; too.<br />Edit1: also forgot i saw this <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless#configure.wpa2.psk">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireles … e.wpa2.psk</a> . looks like you should keep it as &quot;key&quot; not &quot;passphrase&quot; <br />/etc/config/wireless<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  wlan0

					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I built an openwrt image with the wrt160nl profile and squashfs from version 19013 of trunk. The firmware installs fine and boots into openwrt the first time. However, after installing openwrt if I power cycle or reboot the router it will not boot into openwrt. This seemed like the same problem wyngnut was having on page 15. I tried installing the hacked u-boot.bin that androsyn posted and that installed fine, however the router still will not boot into the openwrt image. It will boot just fine when the stock linksys firmware is installed, however. Here are the errors that I am receiving:</p><p>ar7100&gt; bootwrt<br />## Booting WRT160NL ...<br />## Booting image at 81800000 ...<br />Bad Magic Number<br />ar7100&gt; boot<br />## Booting WRT160NL ...<br />Application code length 0x003a0000<br />Bad CRC: trx.crc32 0x682f4f44 calculate 0x3e24ebad</p><p>After installing the new boot.bin I had to change the values of environment variables for the ip addresses, and commit them with saveenv. I am thinking maybe I need to make some more tweaks to the boot environment vars? Also, I did wait 30+ minutes after initially booting the router before power cycling it, to make sure any filesystem operations were completed. </p><p>Does anyone have any ideas? </p><p>Any help is appreciated.<br />Thanks,</p><p>Justin</p><br /><p>Update:</p><p>If anyone is interested, the root problem is that when mini_fo creates the jffs2 file system, something is changed which causes the u-boot CRC check to fail upon a subsequent reboot. And for whatever reason, using a different bootcmd did not fix the problem on my box. </p><p>But I was able to work around this by creating /jffs on a USB drive instead of directly on flash, using this write-up as a starting point: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22842">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22842</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jethier</strong> on 11 Jan 2010, 23:05)</p>

					<p>Thanks, calltrace. </p><p>I built my own image with the ar71xx and profile wrt160nl.
