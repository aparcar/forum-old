					<p>I got a new WRTSL54GS and installed RC5. I have tried to use the PPPoE to access my DSL. I followd the instructions on WIKI. At first, the router cannot access the DSL at all and no ip address can be obtained from the ISP. This is solved by setting wan_device=eth1 (the default is wan_device=vlan1). Now, I can use it to access the Internet. However, I soon face another problem. I can&#039;t visit some websites, e.g., <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a>, although I can access google, yahoo etc without problem. I also tried to ssh to a remote host. If I ls a folder with just several files, it works fine. Then if I ls a folder with many files, first several files will be listed and then it gets stucked. The only way I can quit is then forcing to terminate the ssh connection. I doubt this is related to the mtu setting. But change the MTU seems not working. I am sure this is related to PPPoE because if I change the WAN setting to STATIC IP and put it after my old router, no such problem at all. Has anyone ever met the same problem before and can give me a hint on how to solve it? thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I installed RC5 on my SL just a short while ago, and I can confirm I had to change the nvram wan setting to eth1, too, which was originally vlan1.&nbsp; Looking into the /proc stuff and what I&#039;ve read the wiki, this didn&#039;t seem to match up.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t had the time to figure out what the correct settings are or where to set them.</p><p>I&#039;m also running pppoe, but I never had the issues you&#039;re facing.&nbsp; Once I finally got it to connect (pointing at the correct port) it&#039;s been pretty smooth sailing (and far better than my previous router).&nbsp; That said, I&#039;m pretty much exclusively connected via wireless, so the eth# ports may still be skewed and I just haven&#039;t noticed.&nbsp; Are you having problems while plugged in, or via wireless or both?</p>									</div>

					<p>I just tried the wired port. have no time to try the wireless yet. But I don&#039;t think the wireless will be different. I did the ssh test to a remote host when I logged in openwrt box and still facing the same problem. So I believe the problem is at the WAN port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mactalla,</p><p>If possible, could you please send me a copy of your nvram dump? I doubt that there is something wrong in my nvram setting. My email: hunhunk@yahoo.com. Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mactalla,</p><p>I compared your nvram settings with mine and found one key difference. I have pppoe_ifname=eth1 while there is no such entry in your nvram. I did a &quot;nvram unset pppoe_ifname&quot; and after reboot, my PPPoE works smoothly now. Thanks again for the nvram dump.</p>									</div>
