					<p>Thanks for the instructions, I flashed my WA7750RE with OpenWrt, and it worked well.</p><p>But later on, in an attempt to flash back to factory firmware, I managed to brick the device. All I did was copying the factory firmware to /tmp, and then &#039;mtd -r write /tmp/tplink-factory-firmware.bin firmware&#039;. The command ran for a few seconds, and failed with an error (I forgot to copy down the exact error message). All I know is that it now has a flashing LED when plugged in, and won&#039;t boot up. If I plug a Windows PC to the ethernet port, the network status switches between &quot;Enabled&quot; and &quot;Network Cable Unplugged&quot; alternatively, and I cannot ping the device at all.</p><p>So I&#039;m seeking help here to see if it is possible to unbrick it by working with its Uboot bootloader. </p><p>My question is: did I damage the bootloader itself in flashing the factory firmware?

					<p>@johndoe<br />My next build I will include pptp en ppoe, I could compile the package for you, since it is a kernel module and it is out of sync with the repo (that will happen after a few days). It wouldn&#039;t fit properly on the jffs2 partition.</p><p>@alanine<br />You didn&#039;t damage the bootloader, but the problem is that they where smart enough to use eth1 on the board to bypass the onboard switch (that isn&#039;t connected to anything) and still leave the bootloader tied to eth0</p><p>The only way to unbrick it is breaking the device open: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/6tRIz">http://imgur.com/a/6tRIz</a><br />The pinout for the ttl-uart is identical to any other tp-link device. you could use a 3.3v ttl -&gt; usb converter to connect to the board.</p><p>However, the ip the u-boot loader uses is 192.168.1.111 and it connects to 192.168.1.100, see this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=215428#p215428">post</a> earlier in this thread.</p><p>Before you flash the firmware, you have to cutoff the boot part of the tp-link firmware image.<br />Download the image: <a href="http://goo.gl/p6bD9c">stripped_wa750RE_V1_131015.bin</a> This tp-link image has the bootloader stripped of.</p><p>Here are the commands for u-boot if you decide to open the case:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftpboot 0x80000000 firmware.bin

					<p>@FriedZombie first of all THANKS SO MUCH for this, i bought a WA750RE recently and OpenWRT is working really well however i am missing the ability to do a VPN on it, openvpn seems too big so i went with pptp but &quot;kmod-mppe&quot; (and its deps kmod-ecb and kmod-sha1) are missing, any chance to add them in the future? I have tried to force mods in current trunk but they do not load correctly.</p><p>Thanks!!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Mmm, i have created an image using the trunk Image Builder however the size of the resulting &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs&quot; is a lot smaller (1966080) than the image on the trunk (2883588), i have used this command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make image PROFILE=TPWA750 PACKAGES=&quot;$(wget -qO - http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/config | sed -ne &#039;s/^CONFIG_PACKAGE_\([a-z0-9-]*\)=y/\1/ip&#039;)&quot;</code></pre></div><p>So, in theory, the image should be the same as openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa750re-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin in the trunk, correct? Not sure if i should go on flashing, i do not want to brick the device.</p><p><strong>edit</strong> using just the &quot;make install&quot; target the image builder creates all variants and the size of WA750 is correct, i will try to flash this evening</p><p><strong>edit2</strong> 27/1/2014 trunk built with image builder, no web UI, no ipv6 + openvpn works like a charm, if someone wants me to share the image just let me know (i repeat no web ui)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johnuopini</strong> on 29 Jan 2014, 09:48)</p>

I have to reconfigurate the device each time the main router&nbsp; changes the mac adrress ( BSSID ) of wifi interface. The main router is DIR-320/NRU B1 flashed with Keenetic at this moment.</p>									</div>
