					<p>Hello, dear opewnrt community, today I pary for your help, cause my nice linsys dead. I performed fan mod and dusring case opening I saw that wire near RP3 desoldered, but I didn&#039;t pay much attention to it, thinking to solder it later. During mod I obce powered unit to check polarity on power connectoor in order to solder hdd power connector and connect it to fan. So as I suppose, wire could short RP3, but I&#039;m really not shure, cause it was fixed with glue. Anyways when I finished mod and powered unit it showed me only fast blinking-power. I use my old-good jtag cable in order to look&nbsp; what had happened. Each time I try at least -probonly option it hang during memory inicialization, if during hang I deattach jtag cable and then attach it work for that time, afterthat again it most commonly doesn&#039;t work, if I retry this procedure for a long time it began to work as it should but CPU almost never come to debug mode.. Anyways backuped flash and opened it in hex editor.. Hm it was terrebly corrupted.. I&#039;ll show you a piece of firmware. <br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://vorkachev.info/openwrt/fw_comp.jpg" alt="http://vorkachev.info/openwrt/fw_comp.jpg" /></span><br />As you may see almos each second bite have value -40, but only if it&#039;s initial value is bigger than 40.. It makes me crazy)) I&#039;ve made full erase and right after that dumped cfe it wasn&#039;t fffffffffffffffffffffffffff etc.. it was ffbbffbbffbbffbbffbbffbb.. so again. May be hardware masters may help me? I have friend, who for shure can help me to change memory if needeed as well as any other component. So please point me to resolving. By the way Trendnet TEW-630APB v2 Sucks hard from my dear linksys even being n-type and costing triple linksys price I can&#039;t use it anymore, too few setup options, can&#039;t control my adsl modem, no more server I hate it, I love my 16Gb-SD linksys</p>									</div>

					<p>Disclaimer: I know nothing about hardware--I&#039;m just suggesting some things you can try to debug the problem. Don&#039;t try and do anything weird unless it is obviously causing the problem and you have checked to see if others have the same issue.</p><p>Based on that screenshot, bit 6 (i.e. hex(1&lt;&lt;6) is 0x0040) is always 0 in every 16-bit (2-byte) word.<br />When you write, was it ffbbffbb?&nbsp; or just ffbf ffbf ffbf .....&nbsp; Because then it would involve bit 3 as well?&nbsp; But most likely it&#039;s related to the same thing and the flash chip might have been freaking out.<br />To me that feels like one of the data lines is just shorted to ground.&nbsp; Since that would cause anything reading from the chip to see 0 for all the bits that are shorted (which in your case would just be bit 6</p><p>I found one reference to this datasheet but that person didn&#039;t say which GS he was using--the newer ones probably use different flash chips.<br /><a href="http://php.rediris.es/pub/mirror/intel/flcomp/datashts/29066720.pdf">http://php.rediris.es/pub/mirror/intel/ â€¦ 066720.pdf</a><br />Which shows DQ6 being pin 49 (8th from the corner across from the dot)<br />That pin does happen to be next to a ground at pin 48</p><p>Most likely your flash chip is different so I would try looking on your board for the type of chip and googling for the corresponding datasheet... and look for the pinout.</p><p>I would suggest looking at all the pins on the flash chip to see if there&#039;s anything obvious going on with any of the pins. (shorted to ground, shorted to each other, etc.)&nbsp; If there&#039;s a tiny piece of wire that landed on the flash chip. Also, check where they wires go to and see if anything has gone wrong there.</p><p>Hopefully the data lines are just attached to ground which (I assume) can&#039;t cause any real damage to the flash chip.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, phorn for your fast reply, I&#039;ve checked dump, y memory was wrong, when flash is erased it show ffbfffbfffbfffb etc, you were right with my memory module, and it seems that something very small was between 48 and 49 pins, I cleared pins, even used wacum cleaner, but result was same fffbfffbfffb.. May be shorten pins killed memory so even cleaning pins didn&#039;t help.. Also inspite of precense of something near 48 and 49 it was very small not actually shortining pins, but may be it shortened them and after that made a rotation. Anyways how do you think will it be enough to replace memory or something elese can be involved?</p>									</div>

					<p>When you say &quot;the result was the same&quot;, did you actually try to do a full erase over JTAG again?<br />Likely the ffbf was actually stored in flash memory (when you write it works the same way as reading), so in order to write you probably have to erase each block again and then try it.</p><p>(Also, was the &quot;small thing&quot; you took out conductive?&nbsp; Or just a piece of dust)</p><p>Another thing you can try is to do resistance testing between each pin and ground (of course while powered off).&nbsp; ** (I don&#039;t know if this damages flash memory--maybe do some reading on how nand flash memory chips work)</p><p>It&#039;s also possible that the flash memory is actually dead -- in which case you would have to replace it (I don&#039;t know how or where you would get a flash chip).&nbsp; But usually when flash memory itself dies, the entire eraseblock is dead, not individual bits.&nbsp; So I think there&#039;s still a good chance for recovery if you look at everything.&nbsp; For example, like the &quot;wire near RP3 desoldered&quot; thing you mentioned. That might be important.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve found out that actualy dataheet is not to my router, cause mine memory eben with same identification has 48-leads inspite of 56, I used multimeter and tested all pins with ground, and I found two of them which was shorted to ground and betwee themselfs, but as far as I didn&#039;t find suitable datasheet to it I can&#039;t think that it may be the problem. About bfffbfff I may say that yes, I&#039;ve reflashed it and only then dumped firmware. About rp3 I soldered it at last very good and checked rp3 itselfs it&#039;s not shorted betwwen pins. So I actually don&#039;t know what to do.</p><p>Just for curiosity I opened my TEW-630APB and was defenaelly impressed firstly:<br /><a href="http://vorkachev.info/DSC_0651.JPG">photo1</a> <a href="http://vorkachev.info/DSC_0658.JPG">photo2</a> of a board itselfs<br />Curiou that it definately can be upgraded to router with a bit soldering, LAN chip, filters and connectors are missed, I also wondered if it possible to upgrade firmware to router&#039;s one, I think that it should be possible. In the right lowest coner we may see jtag or serila.. I suppose that it&#039;s a jtag, but didn&#039;t tested it. As cpu is atheros I suppose that it&#039;s possible to upload openwrt to it, wourse is it&#039;s bumber is: AR5416 and it&#039;s not supported as far as I see, May be someone already started some tests wit this board?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vorkachev</strong> on 17 Nov 2008, 14:15)</p>
