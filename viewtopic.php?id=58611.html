					<p>Hi, after a lot of problems trying to get my Linksys WRT1900AC to work in New Zealand, someone on a local forum suggested I try OpenWRT. </p><p>I downloaded and flashed &quot;openwrt-15.05-rc3-mvebu-armada-385-linksys-cobra-squashfs-factory.img&quot; and now the device has rebooted, I just get a flashing power light. </p><p>Hopefully this is just me being dumb and theres a golden solution for this. Please advise.</p>									</div>

					<p>So you are telling Putty to communicate over Com3, but that doesn&#039;t mean the hardware is actually set up on com3. Check device manager.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 28 Jul 2015, 00:42)</p>
