					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;m a noob at this, but I have purchased a TL-WR1043ND version 2.1 and I&#039;m experiencing a lot of issues.</p><br /><p>What I have done so far:</p><p>-Install&nbsp; trunk (barrier breaker)&nbsp; (factory)<br />-Enter via telnet, set password<br />-Enter via ssh, install Luci, and enable<br />-Enter luci</p><p>Now I want to set vlan, but when I make any configuration and I press save &amp; apply, it freezes and I have to restart from step 1 (even reinstall luci)</p><p>When I try to set the vlan via manual /etc/config/network, I can actually save the file but it freezes again and I can&#039;t get it work.</p><p>Any help? I have reinstalled openwrt but the same happens</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
