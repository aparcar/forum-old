					<p>Indeed. Meanwhile I filed a bug that should be closed. As a neophyte OpenWrt user, I humbly suggest that the web interface provide feedback that WPA support isn&#039;t installed, so that users either can&#039;t or know they shouldn&#039;t select it. Thank you very much for the help.</p>									</div>
