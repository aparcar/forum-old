					<p>I upgraded from 4.9.34 to 4.9.77 on my 1200ac and mwan3 seems to be broken.&nbsp; I have a DSL router (line goes down a few times / day) and a LTE router that is more reliable but also more expensive / data cap - with a higher latency.&nbsp; Prior to the upgrade, all worked as intended - fail-over, load balancing etc.&nbsp; After the upgrade, all traffic would only get sent over my primary wan (eth0.2) and not my wan2 / LTE interface (eth0.3).&nbsp; &nbsp;The interfaces are up but traffic will never get sent to wan2 - even if I unplug the wan.&nbsp; I noticed that the luci interface has changed a bit so perhaps there is a bug that got introduced - with that said, all the config files are correct.&nbsp; reverting back to 4.9.34 and my pre-upgrade config restores everything.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello David,<br />Just a quick email of thanks, and one question, as I have upgraded the WRT3200ACM successfully and all is working very well and will upgrade the other router this weekend. Granted, I do have a lot to learn as we do have more options to configure but will not touch them until I know more.<br />The one question is about wireless. I can see that we can run AC at 160Mhz yet no matter what I do I cannot get it to work. After some research I read that additional hardware is required yet no idea of what hardware. Can you please, assuming you would know, shed some light on the 160 Mhz band as I am hoping it will improve the distance the wireless can reach?<br />Kind regards,</p>									</div>

					<p>@Morrile 40, 80, 160 MHz just means , that the AP uses one/two/three addition parallel channels to increase the BANDWIDTH, not the range. It is actually the opposite true, more parallel channels more bandwidth but in theory less range, because of more variables for interference sources. If range is your goal, you should use 2.4Ghz, which just can do 300/400Mbit though with 40Mhz. 5Ghz isnt optimal for high range indoor, because it cant go through (thick) walls. If you have a larger house, you should have had bought wifi extender or multiple APs instead of the WRT3200ACM, for example these ( <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Networks-Dual-Band-passive-UAP-AC-LITE/dp/B016K4GQVG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518868356&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=Ubiquiti+Networks+2.4GHz%2F5GHz%2Cp">https://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Network … 2F5GHz%2Cp</a> ) To use 40 2.4Ghz or 40, 80, 160 5Ghz your clients need to support that too of course.</p><p>@cdr yes, I have the feeling, that dnscrypt-proxy doesnt work properly with multiple sources, or there is some nasty bug. As I see it, there is some weird issue too with some (a lot) of the dnscrypt DNS servers, which randomly seem to block me (maybe some stupid ddos protection?). Then I cant reach them anymore for some time. I have removed the redundancy servers two and three and just use one right now, and the problems vanished so far, which is really stupid though. I am just sticking with one, dnscrypt.nl-ns0. Most on the list seem to be down anyway or give certificate errors for me. I am really annoyed so far by it. It also happens randomly, that I cant reach &quot;exotic&quot; domains ending with .bz or such, I had it also now, that I couldnt reach .org domains through it (this site included).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 17 Feb 2018, 14:07)</p>

					<p>Experimental build with kernel 4.14.18 r6177 just finished compiling.&nbsp; It was a challenge, but over all not too much effort as it was just a bit of trial and error. Ultimately, samba refuses to compile, so I removed it until I can figure out what&#039;s happening. wget complained of a dependent library, however, I was able to remove the package and re-add as a busybox wget support and tests show it works normally.</p><p>The Samsung S8 refused to connect via Wifi until it was rebooted. I&#039;m assuming the Amazon FireTV&#039;s will have the same issue, but will find out in just a little bit. </p><p>If all goes decently, I&#039;ll upload the packages to the server tomorrow.</p>									</div>

					<p>@davidc502 if you include busybox wget, make sure to include ssl support too. I think you have to check that on as as optional build in. I cant remember anymore, but something never worked with the busybox wget and I always had to install standalone wget. I also find, you should remove things like Samba from the inbuild version, and make it optional. Samba is totally not something you want to have on a router. Same as watchcat, collectd, sysstat, igmpproxy, miniupnpd.</p><p>@beginner67890 Thank you VERY much, that you did this test over some time. Too bad you were able to run into the same kernel panic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I actually noticed, you are still on r4901, why? Maybe the issue I have just was implemented after r4901 but I am not sure. Was the RTC problem btw 100% resolved on the 1200? No I havent got a new router so far. I am a bit too lazy right now, because if I would ship it back, I had no router for mostly two weeks or so. It is really weird, I hadnt got the kernel panic nor reboot now again anymore too for 16 days. I wonder whats causing it... maybe I have a really small range of bad RAM, which when I&#039;m lucky, doesnt get used when I reboot the router, because it may be on the back end of the 512MB, and so rarely gets used. Or it is a temperature issue. The weather was really cold over the past weeks here, maybe it was enough to give it just 2-3°C to make it stable, which I doubt though. The router stays open and nothing blocks it. I also dont have anything high CPU using running on it. Load average is mostly 0-1% in middle. Maybe the reboots I had also were triggered by this Google Android Chromecast bug which can lead to router crashes I read? But I doubt it.</p>									</div>

I have had no problems with r4901 even if this is missing some important fixes for the Krack attack vulnerability. I am interested in the new 4.14 kernel build and might upgrade soon after some user reports.</p><p>The changes to the RTC hardware clock usage were made after the r4901 build so I don&#039;t have any experience with that. My hardware clock doesn&#039;t cause problems even if there is a lot of drift. Some embedded systems use the fake-hwclock package to initialize the system clock before correcting with the NTP so I don&#039;t know how the newer davidc502 builds deal with the clock during startup now without the fake-hwclock. I haven&#039;t seen a lot of complaints recently.</p><p>My WRT1200AC seems to be more responsive after stopping the test.sh script. Maybe all of the pings made the internet slow down or just the sleep command caused a delay. The script ran the entire time without causing a crash so that is still mysterious. I am glad your router has been better than before. The &#039;stress&#039; program seems complicated yet should identify problems caused by a bad chip or overheating. I wonder if the heatsink might be mislocated allowing some overheating.</p><p>I finally found the archive I was looking for so don&#039;t need to worry if upgrading to a newer build without a way to return to my happy install. That was inside the &#039;packages&#039; link: <a href="https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/snapshots/">https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/snapshots/</a>. I learn something new every day or so.</p>									</div>
