					<p>Hello,</p><p>i have a TP-Link WA830RE v2, which is identically to a WRT841N v8. Currently i am using the stock firmware, using the Range Extender Mode 1 (no WDS, client mode connection to another AP, plus providing own AP), to connect to a TP-Link WDR4300 (=N750) via 802.11n on 2.4GHz. All client on both sides of the &quot;bridge&quot; are in the same subnet, and can see each other. <br />Real-Life transfer speeds are around 90 MBit/s, which is quite good. </p><p>Now, i want to use the WA830RE v2 with OpenWRT, because i don&#039;t like the stock firmware, and every other router in my network is on OpenWRT already. I read the OpenWRT <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode">wiki clientmode article</a>. Because WDS would halve the possible transfer speed, it&#039;s not an option. The other solution with using the clientmode as WAN would kill the networking in the same subnet and needs NAT. Not an option, too. </p><p>Is there anyway to replicate the behavior of the stock firmware in OpenWRT ? <a href="https://127n.de/dl/NetworkBridge.png">Here</a> is a small network diagram of the current setup.</p><p>This is the description of Range Extender Mode 1 from the stock firmware </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Range Extender mode 1 - In Range Extender mode 1, the AP with WDS disabled will relay data to an associated root AP. AP function is enabled meanwhile. The wireless repeater relays signal between its stations and the root AP for greater wireless range. Please input the MAC address of root AP in the field &quot;MAC Address of Root AP&quot;.</code></pre></div><br /><p>Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>markusm</strong> on 1 Jun 2014, 16:56)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t think that WDS itself halves the speed. Your speed is halved when your unit receives and transmits all the packets via wifi, this is when the speed is halved, because wifi is half-duplex. But this is what you have already, unless you have your WA connected by cable, which you don&#039;t by the picture. If you set everything up correctly (mainly option noscan 1, 40MHz channels) you can expect about the same speeds when you enable WDS. I&#039;m using WDS bridges too, but 90mbit is a dream, I don&#039;t believe you can get 90mbit of real throughput on a wifi client connected to the retransmitting unit, on your computer connected by cable 192.168.0.100 it is possible though. Some math: 300mbit wifi /2 is 150mbit of real data throughput MAX, when retransmitted we are at 75mbit, which is the max speed you can get under ideal conditions...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 1 Jun 2014, 18:10)</p>

					<p>Yep, you are right, i should have mentioned, that the important computer is connected via cable to the WA830RE - the repeater function is just nice-to-have for smartphones and notebooks. it&#039;s a complicated setup, because i can&#039;t connect the two routers via cable i need the wireless bridge over a distance of 20 metres, through three walls. the WA830RE got two 9dBi directional antennas, too. </p><p>i&#039;ll try with WDS now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
