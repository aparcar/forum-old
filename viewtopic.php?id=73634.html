					<p>First of all: open up the box to see what is inside. SoC type, flash, memory size, serial console.<br />Then you would connect to the serial console and check the boot log, enter the boot loader, gather information. But make sure to read the wiki pages about the serial console first.</p>									</div>

					<p>The CPU seems to be a SH4 from the SuperH architecture, which seems to be supported by the linux kernel. I haven&#039;t seen any indication of that architecture to be supported in OpenWrt, so I think you would have to start with adding support for that architecture.<br />Some pages with information to get started:<br /><a href="https://elinux.org/Processors#SuperH">https://elinux.org/Processors#SuperH</a><br /><a href="http://www.linux-sh.org/shwiki/FrontPage/">http://www.linux-sh.org/shwiki/FrontPage/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p><p>As a starting point how would I go about booting a supported version of Linux on this system before trying to build OpenWrt for it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, usually enter the boot loader via serial console, move a kernel image into the devices RAM via TFTP (ethernet) or the serial line and boot it up.</p>									</div>

					<p>I gave up on that black box as I couldn&#039;t any way to connect a serial console.</p><p>I&#039;m now looking at another black box which does have an RS232 port. I can&#039;t see the CPU on this one as a heat sink seems to be glued to it. However I see a label on the motherboard which says <strong>AIR900HD</strong>. Is there any way to find out what the processor is?</p>									</div>
