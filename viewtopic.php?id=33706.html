					<p>TL;DR:<br />As per the topic, I have a router working as a bridge so it doesn&#039;t have an IP. How do I get into it to change the configuration?</p><p>The long version:<br />Hi, I&#039;m sure I&#039;d posted here a long time ago but being as I just created an account I&#039;ll say it&#039;s my first time here.</p><p>I have this Buffalo WHR-HP-G54DD which has long since lost the DD. About this time last year I got my mother a couple of Apple Airports Express so that she could have a wireless sound system which I could tweak without too much hassle. Unfortunately, the house&#039;s router is pretty useless and laying down cat5 wasn&#039;t an option so I used the Buffalo to pick up the wifi from the house router and then hardwired that into one of the Airports. I then had the Airport create a wireless N network and extended it with the other one so I was left with two networks, one created by the house router and one by the airports.</p><p>This Christmas, not being one for original presents, I got my mum a battery-powered, airplay enabled speaker which meant I could replace one of the Airports (hassle free tweaking and all). This now left me with a spare Airport which I could wire directly into the home router and create the N network right there. Now the one connected to the Buffalo is the one that&#039;s extending that network and I&#039;m left with my Buffalo not doing much at all.</p><p>So what I want to do now is reverse the role of the Buffalo. I want it to take the hardwired connection from its Airport and create a G network on the same SSID as the home router, thus creating a dirty, dirty roaming network for devices that can&#039;t handle 5GHz. The problem is that I can&#039;t get into it because it&#039;s still acting as a bridge, so it doesn&#039;t have an IP I can get to.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to TPFT it on 192.168.1.1 as well as 192.168.11.1&nbsp; using both macTFTP and command line TFTP but none of them want to do anything with the openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx that I&#039;ve presumably had sitting on my laptop since last year and is presumably what I used last year to get it going in the first place.</p><p>So yeah, I have no idea where I could be going wrong or where to start with going right, but any help would be much appreciated.</p>									</div>
