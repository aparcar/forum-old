					<p>Hi everyone, I am using two routers with 8.09 RC1 to make a VPN bridge, I have splitted the addresses of the two DHCP servers, but sometimes happens that the IP is assigned by the remote DHCP server instead the local.<br />Here it is the config:</p><p># brctl show<br />bridge name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge id&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STP enabled&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interfaces<br />br-lan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8000.001884d01128&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ath0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tap0</p><p>Is there a firewall rule to prevent DHCP traffic to route on tap0 interface, even if it is part of the br-lan bridge?<br />Thanks</p><p>Francesco</p>									</div>

					<p>The tap-based tunnel is a layer 2 tunnel, which transmits broadcasts (i. e. DHCP requests) too. For performance reasons (you don&#039;t want to send all your local broadcast traffic over the tunnel) and security reasons (you can use your firewall to restrict access) you should switch to a tun-based tunnel (layer 3), which uses IP routing between your local subnets, which should use different address ranges.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you&#039;ll be unable to filter this using iptables, since DHCP is using &quot;raw socket&quot; so iptables will not see the traffic. You can try if you&#039;ll be lucky with ebtables (filter it on bridge). For a little more information see e.g.: <a href="http://openvpn.net/archive/openvpn-users/2005-03/msg00487.html">http://openvpn.net/archive/openvpn-user â€¦ 00487.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you drama for your answer, I&#039;ve read the info, now I understand why I wasn&#039;t able to stop the traffic.<br />I&#039; can try using iptables as written in that mailing list, maybe adding the IP address of the DHCP server to policies, also:</p><p>iptables -A INPUT -p UDP -i tap0 -d 255.255.255.255 --destination-port 67:68 -j DROP<br />iptables -A FORWARD -p UDP -i tap0 -d 255.255.255.255 --destination-port 67:68 -j DROP<br />iptables -A OUTPUT -p UDP -i tap0 -d 255.255.255.255 --destination-port 67:68 -j DROP</p><p>iptables -A INPUT -p UDP -i tap0 -d &lt;br-lan address&gt; --destination-port 67:68 -j DROP<br />iptables -A FORWARD -p UDP -i tap0 -d &lt;br-lan address&gt; --destination-port 67:68 -j DROP<br />iptables -A OUTPUT -p UDP -i tap0 -d &lt;br-lan address&gt; --destination-port 67:68 -j DROP</p><p>So I can stop either Multicast or unicast DHCP request or renew.</p><p>There is a little bug in the luci page where leases are listed:<br />If I request an address, and after a while I set the same address to the same mac address (in a static way), the countdown to lease expiry became negative after passed the 0h 0min 0s</p><p>IPv4-Address&nbsp; &nbsp; MAC-Address&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leasetime remaining<br />192.168.1.xxx&nbsp; &nbsp;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00h 00min -25082s</p><p>To MMCM, I wanted to use the bridged VPN way to forward all the traffic, with no routing (to use samba between the two endpoints, to act like the two networks are connected by a switch, without forwarding ports, without firewall). I tried to do a routed VPN, but I didn&#039;t liked it because of its setup complexity. It&#039;s a home network, I don&#039;t need a lot of stuff.</p><p>I&#039;ll let you know if this trial and error system works,<br />Bye,<br />Francesco</p><br /><p>P.S. Setting static leases in both DHCP servers doesn&#039;t solve the problem of &quot;remote DHCP handshacking&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>So what&#039;s the problem with samba and a routed vpn? You can setup a dedicated wins server on either network, and configure it&#039;s address in both dhcp servers.<br />iptables is not able to filter dhcp traffic in your scenario, because of the bridged interfaces. A bridge does act like a real switch, traffic passes from one interface to the other, without any knowledge of iptables.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi MMCM, thank you for your answer, I know that this isn&#039;t the best way to do a vpn, but when I was making it I chose for something really fast to deploy and set up, and it is still a temporary solution.<br />So, if there was an easy way to prevent dhcp traffic to jump between the two vpn endpoint I could have configured it, but since it is more difficult than I was hoping, I can let the network up in this way. It&#039;s only a notebook that is DHCP client, all the other hosts have static addresses.<br />Bye,<br />Francesco</p>									</div>
