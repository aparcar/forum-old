					<p>I&#039;m quite the noob with embedded Linux and kernel modules, so I&#039;m here to try to clear up a problem I&#039;ve been having.</p><p>I&#039;ve compiled some modified ath/80211 kernel modules for my PC Engine AP running Atitude Adjustment on a 3.3.8 kernel and I&#039;d like to use modprobe to automatically resolve all the dependencies rather than relying on a script of my own making. The problem here is that modprobe is searching for modules.dep, which it cannot find. No big deal, you say, just use depmod. Well, for some reason depmod doesn&#039;t exist in this instance (nor modinfo for that matter).</p><p>So, my question is: why would modprobe be included in a system that doesn&#039;t have the necessary tools to support it? Is depmod supposed to exist, but there was a failure on my part to select it via make menuconfig? Or is this simply a matter of busybox being included in OpenWRT for the sake of space and ease-of-use and it&#039;s up to the user to provide dependencies for the more complicated tools?</p><p>Follow up question: how might I go about figuring out where modprobe is searching for modules.dep? I&#039;m fine with the idea of rewriting this file by hand and placing it in this location, since I&#039;ll only be using modprobe for a handful of modules.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m guessing that this probably won&#039;t get a response, so -- for anyone looking to reload modules that are already in place -- <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx8o15mbseGeSUpOd0xmVWZfS0E/view?usp=sharing">here&#039;s a python file I whipped up to the job for me</a>.
