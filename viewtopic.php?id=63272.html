					<p>I&#039;m trying to get my Verizon hotspot working via USB. Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve got/done so far:</p><p>Linksys EA3500<br />Designated Driver r47197<br />(downloaded from: <a href="http://www.wolfteck.com/projects/candyhouse/openwrt/)">http://www.wolfteck.com/projects/candyhouse/openwrt/)</a></p><p>Everything seems to be working ok in terms of networking/wireless/internet through WAN port.</p><p>Trying to follow these directions:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ltedongle">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/ltedongle</a><br />Or these directions:<br /><a href="http://nucblog.net/2014/10/turn-your-old-wireless-router-into-an-lte-router-with-openwrt/">http://nucblog.net/2014/10/turn-your-ol â€¦ h-openwrt/</a></p><p>I have a problem when it comes to downloading the kmod stuff. I did find kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan_3.10.49-1_kirkwood.ipk but when I go to install it, I get the following:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan_3.10.49-1_kirkwood.ipk<br />Installing kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan (3.10.49-1) to root...<br />Collected errors:<br /> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan:<br /> *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.10.49-1-ece451479b3579b51fc47ef188182834) *<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan.</p><p>I&#039;m guessing because the package was written for an older version but I couldn&#039;t find anything newer. I&#039;ve been doing IT stuff for 15 years and I&#039;m great with Windows but &quot;eh&quot; when it comes to Linux. </p><p>Any help?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Openwrt has strict kernel module checksum checks.<br />In practice you need to install kernel modules (kmod-*) from the same build run that built the main firmware.</p><p>Either<br />- use an official release so that you can install kernel modules from the official repo<br />- use a third-party firmware and use kernel modules from him.<br />- compile everything by yourself.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 10 Mar 2016, 19:15)</p>

					<p>AFAIK, packages for trunk images are rebuilt every time the trunk image is rebuilt which could result in some packages not being installable due to kernel dependencies if your installed trunk image is behind one currently posted.</p><p>The tips would be to either:<br />1. Go back to stable (CC) version so you wouldn&#039;t experience kernel dependencies issues when installing packages in the future.<br />2. Upgrade to the current trunk and then immediately install the packages you need.<br />3. Make a custom image (hint: OpenWrt Image Builder) of trunk snapshot with packages you need built-in.</p><p>UPDATE: typing contest: hnyman 1, me 0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 10 Mar 2016, 19:22)</p>
