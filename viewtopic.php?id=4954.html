					<p>Hi,</p><p>I did the serial mod to my WRT54GS V4, setup PPPD and connected my Tivo to tty/0 so that the Tivo could make its daily calls via PPP. I&#039;m using an image that I built from the SVN trunk of WhiteRussian. I modified the Kernal command line to pipe the output to /dev/null. I also added all the BusyBox serial utilities and mknod.</p><p>My PPPD options file:</p><p>#information about my device<br />/dev/tts/0 #serial port 0<br />115200 #baud rate<br />#options for PPP<br />debug<br />nodetach<br />persist<br />passive<br />nodefaultroute<br />nocrtscts<br />192.168.1.1:192.168.1.83<br />#idle 60<br />ipparam tivo83 #add for ip-up and ip-down<br />maxfail 0<br />proxyarp<br />local<br />noauth<br />lcp-max-configure 100<br />#defaultroute #use router&#039;s default route</p><br /><p>The Tivo connects to the router, but fails the &quot;test call&quot;, saying that the service is unavailable:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc/ppp# pppd call tivo83<br />using channel 11<br />Using interface ppp0<br />Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; /dev/tts/0<br />sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt; &lt;magic 0x64f65290&gt;]<br />rcvd [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt; &lt;magic 0xffff8c22&gt; &lt;pcomp&gt; &lt;accomp&gt;]<br />sent [LCP ConfRej id=0x1 &lt;pcomp&gt; &lt;accomp&gt;]<br />rcvd [LCP ConfReq id=0x2 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt; &lt;magic 0xffff8c22&gt;]<br />sent [LCP ConfAck id=0x2 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt; &lt;magic 0xffff8c22&gt;]<br />sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt; &lt;magic 0x64f65290&gt;]<br />rcvd [LCP ConfAck id=0x1 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt; &lt;magic 0x64f65290&gt;]<br />sent [IPCP ConfReq id=0x1 &lt;compress VJ 0f 01&gt; &lt;addr 192.168.1.1&gt;]<br />rcvd [IPCP ConfReq id=0x1 &lt;addr 0.0.0.0&gt; &lt;compress VJ 0f 01&gt;]<br />sent [IPCP ConfNak id=0x1 &lt;addr 192.168.1.83&gt;]<br />rcvd [IPCP ConfAck id=0x1 &lt;compress VJ 0f 01&gt; &lt;addr 192.168.1.1&gt;]<br />rcvd [IPCP ConfReq id=0x2 &lt;addr 192.168.1.83&gt; &lt;compress VJ 0f 01&gt;]<br />sent [IPCP ConfAck id=0x2 &lt;addr 192.168.1.83&gt; &lt;compress VJ 0f 01&gt;]<br />found interface br0 for proxy arp<br />local&nbsp; IP address 192.168.1.1<br />remote IP address 192.168.1.83<br />Script /etc/ppp/ip-up started (pid 874)<br />Script /etc/ppp/ip-up finished (pid 874), status = 0x0</p><br /><br /><p>It looks like the communication from the Tivo to the router is OK, but the internet routing still needs some work. I&#039;ve tried modifing my ip-up file per all off the HowTo&#039;s and posts that I&#039;ve been able to find. But they&#039;re geared towards using PPP to have the router connect to the internet via a modem, cell phone or PPPoE. I&#039;ve returned my ip-up file to the original (exept some logging). Can someone point me in the right direction on how to set up the router so that it does nat on a device that connects to the router via PPP on the serial port?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Bob</p>									</div>

This has given me a reason to set up one of my PC&#039;s with Linux (ended up going with Gentoo after starting with Gentoo, switching to Mandrake, and then switching back to Gentoo because I liked it&#039;s install and update method better). I spent quite a bit of time reading up on the web on compiling OpenWrt and setting it up (learning about SSH, VI <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />, cross compiling, Linux file system, and the Linux shell commands).</p><p>I have two Series 1&#039;s (so it would have to be TurboNets or CacheCards) that I&#039;d like to connect my WRT54GS. I think that I&#039;m pretty much there with using serial, PPP and the router. I just need a nudge in the right direction.</p><p>Regards,<br />Bob</p>									</div>

					<p>This is working now. I tried a lot of things. I think that the problem was that I was relying on the path to work in the ip-up and ip-down scripts instead of including the full path in the calls to the binaries.</p>									</div>
