					<p>Just a quick few questions. Is 40MHz working for both 2.4 and 5 GHz? Also, is the upper channel range available for 5GHz (149-163)? In my case this upper channel range performs substntially better than the low range for 5GHz (36-48) using the stock firmware. Thank you in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT Backfire per the wndr3700 wiki. Looks like things are mostly working as expected except for the WAN port. I can&#039;t more than about 10 mb/s on from LAN to WAN. I dug around the forums, and could only find a potential solution in changing the QOS settings. I installed the LuCI module for configuring the QOS and tried both disabling QOS and bumping the link speeds up to my actual speeds. I have the problem when trying to route out to my cable modem AND if I just route out to my LAN directly while using another router on the cable modem. On the stock Netgear firmware I can easily get to the 25 mb/s max on my cable modem, and more if I just route between LANs. Note: I have the same issue if I try DD-WRT. With either of the WRTs, flashing back to stock firmware returns full wan speeds.</p><p>Any thoughts on what might be causing this?</p>									</div>

I can ping my internet router&#039;s IP, I can ping my computers IP, I can ping google.ca&#039;s IP, but if I try to ping <a href="http://www.google.ca">www.google.ca</a> it fails with bad address response.&nbsp; I assume this means that the router is still missing some basic configuration data but without the webUI, I am a little lost.&nbsp; </p><p>Encountered another odd thing, apparently after a few minutes the LAN LED for the port my router is connected to shuts off and I get an error from putty saying software caused a connection reset.&nbsp; This is consistent after just a few minutes and to get it back I sometimes just reseat the cable but sometimes I have to reboot the router.</p><p>Anyhow, long post and lots of issues.&nbsp; If someone could tell me how to perform a command line re-flash I would re-attempt the flashing in case something went wrong.&nbsp; As always I will accept any suggestions as to courses of action that will get me a working router for MLPPP. </p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>
