					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>Recently stuck my ISP-provided router into bridge mode and got hold of a WNDR3700 to put OpenWRT on. It&#039;s working perfectly so far.</p><p>One thing I&#039;d quite like to do is record bandwidth usage through the WAN interface. On some old IPCop boxes I still have in service there&#039;s a great addon (Extra Graphs) which record overall totals per hour/day (ingress and egress) but also allow you to specify any ports that you&#039;re interested in recording. It also generates graphs.</p><p>An IPCop box has much more power and storage than my OpenWRT router so I was just wondering what&#039;s possible in this respect with the WNDR3700?</p><p>From reading a few bits in the wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/bwmon">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/bwmon</a> and here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vnstat">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vnstat</a> it looks like vnstat and bmon could do the job of recording the data quite nicely. If I can get the data off in some sort of machine-readable format then I&#039;m happy to parse this myself and generate the graphs. bandwidthd looks like a bit of a beast to run on the WNDR3700.</p><p>A few questions...</p><p>1) Do either of these utilities allow me to record the data going through a particular port in addition to the totals? Is there a way to do that with OpenWRT?</p><p>2) Both bmon and vnstat appear to be able to output to a directory accessible by HTTP using the uhttp package. Can both of these packages use uhttp at the same time? Does this interfere with th LuCi interface?<br />I suppose I&#039;m sort of wondering if I would need to setup Apache-style vhosts within uhttpd or whether each runs its own instance of uhttpd?</p><p>3) Data storage to WNDR3700&#039;s internal memory. I&#039;m usually cautious when writing too much data to NAND/flash of embedded devices in case I gradually wear down the chips. Would this be something I should worry about with the WNDR3700?<br />I was thinking it might be an idea to dig out an old 512MB USB flash drive and connect that to the WNDR3700 to store the data somewhere persistent. Then I would also ship the latest data to one of my lab servers with rsync every 12-24 hours or so if it needs processing<br />Does anyone have any examples of the output from bmon and vnstat?</p><p>That&#039;s it for now but I&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be more. Thanks in advance!</p><p>Cheers, B</p>									</div>

					<p>So I&#039;ve found the luce-app-statistics package which seems to do what I want for the totals. Generates the graphs and makes them available through the LuCI interface as well which is a bonus.</p><p>Is there a way to monitor particular TCP/UDP ports?</p><p>Also will recording this data affect the throughput of my WNDR3700?</p><p>Cheers, B</p>									</div>
