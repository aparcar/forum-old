					<p>when i do a reboot of the router my memory shows around 98% of memory. i use it for a few hours maybe a day and then it drops to 19% as shown in this photo.<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/a/QJnnZ">imgur.com/a/QJnnZ</a></p><p>why is this? all im doing is playing a console game..stock firmware no extra things installed or settings changed.. how could it be using so much memory? is it because its been processing all those packets in game? </p><p>and is there a way to say free up memory/ram?<br />and from the look of it it says my total memory is 2071000 kB which is about 2gb right?</p>									</div>
