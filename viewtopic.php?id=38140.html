					<p>So to cut my long story short, i flashed an incomplete OpenWRT firmware (while running OpenWRT). So my router is bricked, ive installed a serial header with the 10k resistor between VCC and TX. I tried connecting to it with Putty but i get nothing in the console window. Could anyone be able to help me out? Am i doing something wrong? or Is the router dead??</p>									</div>

					<p>Your router is most likely still alive. Read a bit through the forum about your serial issue, these things were asked pretty often, so you probably find a solution there.</p>									</div>

					<p>Basically after trying for 3 days now im deciding that the router is dead, i can get no response from it no matter what i try. All i get are the all the LEDs but one lighting up at power up and then the PWR LED remaining on. The switch still seems to work but as far as i can tell the rest is gone :&#039;(</p>									</div>

					<p>if wrong firmware, you could not fully break the device !<br />for example I tried on it 3420 to put from different models, and then through serial restored easily...<br />and you rx and tx entangled probably...</p><p><a href="http://intervito.blogspot.com/2010/11/tp-link-tl-wr741nd-tp-link-tl-743nd.html">http://intervito.blogspot.com/2010/11/t â€¦ 743nd.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>garynych</strong> on 4 Aug 2012, 10:33)</p>
