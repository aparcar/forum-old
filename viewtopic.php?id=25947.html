					<p>I setup a linksys box a year or so ago running openwrt and vpnc, but that is about it for my experience with this software. Hopefully someone can help me. I just loaded Backfire 10.03 brcm-2.4 on a linksys WRT54GL v1.1. The main thing I want to do with it is install the Openconnect VPN client. I&#039;m assuming I don&#039;t have enough space on my file system. On the web gui, I click &#039;Update package lists&#039; and then searched for openconnect. I clicked install, and it dies with error 255. I tried manually downloading the package, and I get this:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/tmp# opkg install openconnect_2.01-1_brcm-2.4.ipk<br />Installing openconnect (2.01-1) to root...<br />Collected errors:<br /> * verify_pkg_installable: Only have 584kb available on filesystem /overlay, pkg openconnect needs 947<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package openconnect.</p><br /><p>Anyone got any tips on what I could do to free up some space or a different method? Googling this didn&#039;t get a lot of hits. I&quot;m not sure if that is a good sign or a bad sign.<br />Thanks,<br />Matthew</p>									</div>

					<p>build your own image (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a>) and include everything you need into the image. the squashfs of the image has a better compressionrate than the jffs2-filesytem of the /overlay-partition. the package is to big to install it into the overlay, but it might fit into the image. and only select packages you really need (e.g. a webinterface isn&#039;t mandatory to run openwrt)</p>									</div>

					<p>That package seems excessively large. What&#039;s in it? The openconnect binary itself is only 86KiB or so on x86_64 (albeit dynamically linked against libxml, openssl, zlib).</p><p>You *really* need to update to 2.25, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ew, it&#039;s statically linked against OpenSSL. Surely that&#039;s not necessary any more? The DTLS support has been in upstream OpenSSL since 0.9.8m -- surely you&#039;re not still using something older than that?</p>									</div>

					<p>I want to upgrade to 2.25. See <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25996">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=25996</a><br />It doesn&#039;t appear the package that is in the OpenWRT repository has any chance of working. I just don&#039;t know how to upgrade. It is not my area of expertise. I tried to find directions, and most of what I could find referred to older versions of OpenWRT. I believe I need to find the SDK for Backfire, and I couldn&#039;t even find that.</p>									</div>
