					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I have a TP-Link MR11U with an additional USB mini wifi dongle.<br />Both wifi works fine (internal and USB) but I want to set up the USB-wifi to use a script to connect to different networks.</p><p>I try to create a script which scans for wifi on wlan1 and if it will find a known SSID it will connect to it.<br />Over this forum I found out to use <br />udhcpc -i wlan1 -b <br />to set up the dhcp client on wlan1. This works fine. But I cannot switch to another wifi.</p><p>Here is the wlan1-part of my wireless config:<br />config wifi-device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option macaddr &#039;7c:dd:90:50:60:e6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option hwmode &#039;11ng&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option htmode &#039;HT20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;GF&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;SHORT-GI-20&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;SHORT-GI-40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list ht_capab &#039;RX-STBC1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option disabled &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel &#039;6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower &#039;27&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option country &#039;US&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #option ssid &#039;Jin-AnHotel&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #option encryption &#039;none&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;radio1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode &#039;sta&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network &#039;wwan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #option bssid &#039;74:25:8A:EC:BF:38&#039;</p><p>The config was set up via Luci. I uncommented the lines which are only for the one Hotel network config and tried it again with the following commands:<br />ifconfig wlan0 down<br />ifconfig wlan1 up<br />iwconfig wlan1 essid AndroidAP<br />udhcpc -i wlan1 -b</p><p>But it always likes to connect to Jin-AnHotel.<br />After a reboot and switching on wlan1 I was connected to AndroidAP but when I once connected to Jin-AnHotel via<br />ifconfig wlan0 down<br />ifconfig wlan1 up<br />iwconfig wlan1 essid Jin-AnHotel<br />udhcpc -i wlan1 -b</p><p>I later could not connect to AndroidAP again... very strange.</p><p>My goal is to have a list with known SSIDs and if necessary keys and my MR11U should scan and check if it knows one host. If yes, connect to it (as wwan interface behind my firewall).</p><p>Any ideas how to fix it? I already searched in the forum but I couldn&#039;t find anything related to my problem.</p><p>I would like to reduce the writing on the flash to a minimum, so I would prefer something which does not reconfigure the uci-settings and restart network.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help!<br />Georg</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the fast reply.</p><p>Yesterday I was in the #openwrt channel in IRC.<br />I was told I don&#039;t need to use UCI commit. </p><p>The reason is, I want to reduce the writing on the flash to a minimum because I want to let a script scan for wifi and set the values.</p><p>I will have a try with your UCI and a shell script but without uci commit. Let&#039;s see if it works.</p>									</div>
