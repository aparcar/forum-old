					<p>AFAIK atheros wifi drivers allow to create several interfaces and route traffic between them, bringing the possibility to make an universal wifi repeater</p><p>For the WRT54GL might be also possible with the propietary drivers (brcm2.4).</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

You can simply add it in LuCi â†’ WiFi, or create a new section of wifi-ifacein /etc/config/wireless. The only difference is that this time you don&#039;t need to specify the WDS option. In fact you cannot do that. The SSID and password could be the same as host SSID if you want, but not necessarily. As long as you connect this new interface to lan, which default is, your other wireless devices connecting through this AP will also be seen as part of the big network.</p></blockquote></div><p> </p><p>So it is impossible to do ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Vincs</strong> on 29 Feb 2016, 10:21)</p>
