					<p>Hi guys!</p><p>I have just set up OpenWRT x86 into my old PC, but couldn&#039;t manage to bridge my PPPOE connection to my LAN. I have 2 nics installed as eth0 being the lan and eth1 being the pppoe connection.</p><p>Whenever I check the box to bridge eth1 together eith eth0, my wan disconnects and just goes back up when I uncheck it. </p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and stuff but I&#039;m getting used. </p><p>Here&#039;s the uci export network (without the bridge)</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/P016pzB.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/P016pzB.jpg</a></p><p>Sorry for not pasting the input here. Can&#039;t SSH at the moment, gonna try pasting ir later.</p>									</div>
