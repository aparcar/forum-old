					<p>I have been examing the supported hardware list paying special attention to manufacturers of cable modems that OpenWRT will work on. Being new to OpenWRT I don&#039;t want to purchase a device only to brick it unrepairably.</p><p>I am asking for the community&#039;s recommendation on a fully supported cable modem (I am not concerned with any features other than the ability to play nice with my ISP, i.e. wireless etc).</p><p>Thanks in advance for any tips and pointers!</p>									</div>

					<p>I tend to recommend TP-Link routers; they are relatively cheap, have good hardware, and allow the installation of 3rd party firmware (like OpenWrt) straight from the web interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can use the openwrt router cascaded with cable modem. TPLINK 4300 is a good router and has support in Attitude adjustment which is the stable build.</p>									</div>
