					<p>I&#039;ve checked the flash content after uploading an image into the tftp server of the bootloader again and it contains errornous bytes at the<br />offsets 0, 0x200, 0x400, 0x600, ... (offset from HDR0 marker). Just one byte is wrong at the distance of 512 bytes ...?!<br />I&#039;ve sniffed the contents of the tftp packets to the bootloader (as these packets contain a payload of 512 byte each) - they contain the correct data.</p><p>I really wonder if this is a bug in the bootloader code or if someone has damaged the flash chip (maybe by shortening some pins).<br />I&#039;ll try to upload the firmware by some other CFE commands. Will do JTAG later when I&#039;ve soldered a Wiggler clone.</p><p>Anyone out there who has successfully flashed an image into a WRT54G3G v1.1 by using tftp?</p>									</div>

Reading the kernel back several times matches the image written, but the bootloader still fails with the error above (&quot;invalid bootblock&quot;).<br />I&#039;ve tried two other bootloader found in the web, one for WRT54G3G v1.0 and another from a WRT54GS v1.1. The first one throws a couple of exception during start and hangs while the second one has the same error as the original CFE.</p><p>If the flash device or the bus drivers (hw) were damaged by a previous owner (e.g. by pin shortening), I&#039;d expect random problems while starting the bootloader and problems to write the flash with JTAG.</p><p>Maybe the flash is accessed too fast, i.e. the bootloader programs too few waitstates for the chip select?<br />Does someone know if I can set the number of waitstates for flash access by a nvram setting?</p>									</div>
