					<p>Hello all<br />I have a tp-link wr841nd v5.3 router with a 4mb flash<br />The firmware that I use is kamikaze build r199990 (this is only the one that let me to enable wireless).<br />There is no place on the flash to install kismet (need about 60kb more ) after installing the atheros driver<br />After there is no way to install kismet on the flash, I’ve installed the luci-admin-full web interface<br />At the software tab I changed the OPKG configurations<br />From “option overlay_root /jffs”&nbsp; to “option overlay_root /tmp” to be able to install kismet to the ram (there is about 14MB free at the beginning, and I don’t mind if it will gone every restart)<br />So I installed bough the kismet-server and the kismet –client packages, but I can not run them ?<br />The system just don’t know that they exists, I also tried to find the files buy using “find” but with no luck <br />Anyone has an idea how can I install and run a kismet ? at least the drone part, but better is a server</p>									</div>
