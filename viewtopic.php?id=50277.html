					<p>I have an annoying user problem, which I want to disable. I hope this is possible.</p><p>I&#039;ve found the following note on the wiki page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a></p><p>Note2: From versions 1.8 up to 2.x holding the reset button for more than 30&#039; resets to OpenWRT initial settings.</p><p>Is the built in reset controlled by software or by the hardware (SoC) of the router or is it a feature of OpenWRT?</p><p>I want to disable this button. Some people press the button for more than 30 seconds to get WPS working, because &quot;WPS/Reset&quot; is printed above the button and this way they reset the router to default configuration.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fa11enangel</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 15:32)</p>

					<p>Button events are handled by OpenWrt, even reset buttons.</p><p>Both Attitude Adjustment and Barrier Breaker have scripts in a special directory that are triggered by button presses. In Attitude Adjustment this directory is /etc/hotplug.d/button, in (a somewhat recent) Barrier Breaker it is /etc/rc.button. There should be a &quot;reset&quot; script in there that handles what happens when the reset button is pressed, either delete that (or even better, chmod -x it), or adjust it to your liking.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 25 Apr 2014, 22:45)</p>

					<p>You are right. I found the function in /etc/rc.button/reset. This was the line I removed:</p><p># jffs2reset -y &amp;&amp; reboot &amp;</p>									</div>
