					<p>Hello,<br />I have a FRITZ!Box 7490, with 2,4 and 5 GHz radio spectrum.<br />It is configured to be available only from 9 am to 12 pm.</p><p>The FRITZ!Box is able to create with Multi-SSID 1 private and 1 guest Network.<br />Also I have an Netgear <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">WNDR3700 V1</a> (OpenWRT-14.07).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Private: 192.168.1.0/24   FRITZ!Box: 192.168.1.1/24   WNDR3700: 192.168.1.2/24   DHCP: 192.168.1.30 - 250.

					<p>Someone posted here about FRITZ!Box a few days ago.&nbsp; From the references posted by that person, it seems FRITZ!Box does not support WDS.&nbsp; They do support what they call a &quot;newer, better&quot; repeater mechanism, but sadly don&#039;t seem to provide that information to anyone else - despite saying that they can only act as repeater if the other device also supports this &quot;newer, better&quot; protocol.</p><p>I&#039;d suggest finding out what this &quot;newer, better&quot; mechanism is before attempting to make an OpenWRT device talk to it.</p><p>I&#039;m not German so had to use Google translate, but the following page seems to be quite clear about it: (despite some gross inaccuracies such as claiming WEP is required for WDS)<br /><a href="http://avm.de/nc/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7490/wissensdatenbank/publication/show/1452_Unterstuetzt-die-FRITZ-Box-das-WDS-Verfahren/">http://avm.de/nc/service/fritzbox/fritz … Verfahren/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>valentt thank you I will watch and try it</p><p>atom just for info: AVM also released an english Version of the linked article: <a href="http://en.avm.de/nc/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7490/knowledge-base/publication/show/1452_Does-the-FRITZ-Box-support-the-WDS-procedure/">http://en.avm.de/nc/service/fritzbox/fr … procedure/</a></p><p>It seem that the trend from repeater manufacturers is to impersonate to the Basis / Routers in Client mode and impersonate as accesspoint to the Clients. The advantage is that they are compatible to all Basis / Routers and aren&#039;t dependent on such things as WDS.</p><p>regarding the video:<br />1. Joining the WLAN 0:16 .. 1:10 This works with both radio spectrums.<br />Ping from console (telnet/ssh) and also Ping from PC connected via LAN(1..4) to the FRITZ!Box works.<br />After reboot the connection has been successfully established with the FRITZ!Box.</p><p>The only problem is I can&#039;t pint the PC connected via LAN(1..4) from the FRITZ!Box - it gets an IP 192.168.1.x/24 instead of 192.168.178.x/24.</p><p>Perhaps this Topic, keyword relayd? <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077">Repeater configurations here! Both ways, bridged and simple repeater </a></p><p>2. Creating a second WLAN 1:10 .. 2:38 not tested</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blueice_haller</strong> on 7 May 2015, 01:33)</p>
