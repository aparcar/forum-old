					<p>timaarreee,</p><p>That&#039;s a really cool project... I want one.&nbsp; So you want to try to stuff OpenWrt on a 2 MB flash?&nbsp; It may be possible if you strip it down.&nbsp; However, it would be much easier with another router... perhaps something like the ASUS WL-520GU (cheap on eBay).&nbsp; If you have a router with USB, you can use a USB Arduino and then you won&#039;t have to add a serial port to your WRT54G.</p><p>If you&#039;re set on using your WRT54Gv5, I would make a custom build for brcm-2.4 (instead of brcm47xx) as it should be smaller.&nbsp; You could also try White Russian (instead of later OpenWrt builds).&nbsp; The only package you should have to add is the car_server.c.&nbsp; The referenced project actually used White Russian.&nbsp; I think there is a &quot;micro&quot; White Russian build that may solve your problem (see link below).<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/micro">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/micro</a></p><p>If you need a newer OpenWrt release, Kamikaze will be smaller than Backfire or trunk.&nbsp; Let us know if you get something working on your WRT54Gv5... and I&#039;d like to see your Wifi Robot Car when it&#039;s done.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, that should make it much easier.&nbsp; Another thing you may want to consider is adding USB (1.1) to your WRT54GL (see this post: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23308)">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23308)</a>.&nbsp; With USB you have the option of using a webcam for the video instead of a network cam.&nbsp; If you already have a webcam laying around, this could be a big money saver (not sure about webcam vs. network cam quality differences though).</p><p>I&#039;m working on building one myself.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what I&#039;m using:<br />- WRT54G v2.0 (2 serial ports + 2 USB 1.1) running Backfire (BRCM47xx 2.6 kernel)<br />- Arduino Duemilanove microcontroller (USB)<br />- H2 Hummer RC Car (9v)<br />- Logitech Quickcam Fusion Webcam (USB)</p><p>I already had the WRT54G and webcam.&nbsp; I found the Hummer at a garage sale for $3.&nbsp; I bought the Arduino from Sparkfun for $30.&nbsp; I still need to get some batteries.&nbsp; My Logitech Quickcam Fusion is supported by the Linux UVC Driver (kmod-video-uvc), but other webcams may work better under Linux.</p><p>I&#039;m still working on assembling and programming this, so I can&#039;t guarantee these parts will work well.&nbsp; After I get it working, I&#039;m hoping to write a homebrew app for my Nintendo DS so I can control this thing via wifi on my DS!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 16 Jun 2010, 18:32)</p>

					<p>just thought I&#039;d update you... I have just got my RC car working and now need to sort out some batteries for the router.&nbsp; Would it safe to directly connect a 12v 1.3Ah SLA battery directly to the wrt54gl with out breaking stuff?&nbsp; I already have the arduino connected to it but the car uses it&#039;s own 9.5v NiCd batteries.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that would be safe.&nbsp; You probably can get by with using less voltage to the router if you want to.&nbsp; My WRT54G v2 runs fine on a 5v power supply (even though the stock PS is 12v).&nbsp; If you look inside, there&#039;s a power regulator that brings the voltage down to 3.3v, so you can safely use 5v and up.</p><p>What did you use for the camera?</p>									</div>

					<p>Cool, ill add the SLA today so i can run the car without a power supply.&nbsp; At the moment I have a 2.4GHz camera lying arount that uses a 9v supply that I will connect to the car&#039;s battery.&nbsp; Later on I want to add a network camera so it can be accesed over internet..&nbsp; Or i might try that USB idea out</p>									</div>
