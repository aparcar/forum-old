					<p>Hello,</p><p>i would like to flash my TP-Link TL-WDR4900&nbsp; with open wrt . After the new image is flashed, there is no GUI, so I have to install LUCI too.&nbsp; I have to plug in the router into the modem, to establish the internet connection. Does the flashed router recognize the modem and the internet connection, or should&nbsp; I configurate the router first with PUTTY??. Actually I have cable modem, and normally I donâ€™t need to register with user name or password.</p><p>THX for help.</p>									</div>
