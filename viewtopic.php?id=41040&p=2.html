					<p>Well, that is a hard question in general. Specifically, I look at the code first and find clues--I look in the header and see if something tells the code where to put the un-packed stuff, I try a disassemble and look at what I get to see what I can figure out from it (there often is a pair of li commands for $a0 and $a1 registers where one of the two is the ending address of the file in RAM and I can just subtract the file size to end up with the start address). If nothing else I look for the calls to routines to actually point to the start of a routine--with MIPS code the calls are absolute addressed. Or I look for pointers to string to point to the start of strings and argue from them to file start.</p><p>There are a couple of general things you can count on. The flash address base is likely to be something like 0xbfc00000 or 0x8fc00000 for 4 meg flash. The start of RAM is likely to be 0x80000000 or 0xa0000000. So you can look for areas in the code that use addresses like the above and figure some of what you need from that.</p><p>Reverse engineering code is guess work. You look for other info to help you like datasheets for chips, example source code for similar processors can be a big help (did you know that there are MIPS core processors in FTA reciever boxes), and look for tools that have been generated--gcc can compile MIPS code, there are disassemblers for MIPS (I&#039;ve compiled some source code for a simple MIPS disassembler that was fun to play with), there are simulators for MIPS. Anything can help you figure out how to reverse engineer--the more you know the easy it is likely to be.</p>									</div>

					<p>BTW, the base address for the mainsw is 0x80001000 after lzma extraction. If you look in a disassembly, you will find a li instruction to load the $sp with 80000ff0 and one to load the $gp with something close to the file length in RAM. I knew that the stack pointer builds downward to the base for the code had to be past the $sp value. And the $gp tends to have a little of the end of file within the range of $gp - 0x8000. When I tried 0x80001000 as the lading addr in IDA, I got quite a bit of the code to disassemble and the calls to subroutines looked good and the pointers to strings looked good. I found the first strngs that I could and searched backward for the last 27 bd sequence and used that as my end addr in the IDC. Good results.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>i have bought chinesse version of 702N about year ago. I have tried to change header in EN FW, but without success cause of checksum. <br />If I have understood it corectly you have managed to get EN menu into CN firmware, right? I have read the complete topic, but it is simply to much for me, I am no programmer :-(.</p><p>Could you upload your modified FW somewhere? I would really appreciate it.<br />thank you in advance</p><p>One more question.

					<p>I gave up on putting english menu into the ch fw. Instead I just modded the english fw at two places to let the box think it was ch fw and fixed the checksum. If you wanted to mod more than one english fw to use in the box then that would have to be done again, but no need to go back and forth between ch and eng fw unless you wanted to. The mods to eng fw are small and not worth posting a file IMO--anyone can do it.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can find the box with what you say you can it is not bricked. Odds are that your addr to get to the web pages is not the same. It changes when you put in the english sw too. Try 1.1 as the last two digits of IP addr. Use default password/user.</p>									</div>

					<p>thx for trying to help, but it doesnt make any sense. I found the router on .1.253, I can ping it there, so how can it be on 1.1?<br />Of course that I tried it anyway, without success.</p>									</div>
