					<p>Hi all there.<br />As you can read above I got a WRT54Gl v1.1 which is bricked now.<br />The moment I got it into my hands, was the moment I was flashing OpenWRT onto it and (that&#039;s what I guess at least) sort of messed up the config.<br />Could it be, that I disabled LAN in the configs?<br />Nethertheless when I started the router, the PowerLED was flashing, DMZ was dead and after a while DMZ went on(PowerLED still flashing) and after that, the final state was, that PowerLED went on and DMZ complettly shut off.<br />In that state was worked no telnet, no ping, no ssh.</p><p>Now I read this thread<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20538">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20538</a><br />speaking about failsafe-mode, which I entered (PowerLED and DMZ are flashing, that&#039;s it right?)<br />but still nothing works.</p><p>I got my IP set to 192.168.1.102<br />Subnetmask: 255.255.255.0<br />gateway: 192.168.1.1</p><p>Thankful for any help<br />Greetz SPL</p><p>EDIT<br />New State: In failsafe-mode, I can enter the router via telnet<br />Next Step: Get networking back or refresh with firmware...we&#039;ll see</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>spiderpigloki</strong> on 10 Jun 2009, 14:30)</p>
