After thunderstorms the WiFi was dead and he ate up all his monthly mobile flatrate listening to internet radio. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />To monitor if the proposed solution (by the hotline) was indeed working ((resetting everything)) I set up collectd with a Python script requesting the &#039;remote&#039; WiFi adapters web frontend.</p><p>I put the script, collectd types.db addition and luci lua file online at <a href="https://gist.github.com/cprior/0a9c42755c4d5f274a3a877c20c80aae">https://gist.github.com/cprior/0a9c4275 â€¦ 7c20c80aae</a></p><p>Maybe it helps someone else.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cpr</strong> on 1 Jul 2016, 10:51)</p>
