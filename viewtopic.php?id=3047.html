					<p>Let you know why I am stuck</p><p>As I know there are two ways to rescue a Asus WL500G Deluxe.</p><p>1. Reflash the firmware:&nbsp; Unplug power, press reset, replug power, 1s then release reset.&nbsp; Then can tftp to 192.168.1.1.</p><p>2. Failsafe of openwrt:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unplug power, Plug again and wait for 3s, then press reset and hold for 10s then release.&nbsp; Then can telnet to 192.168.1.1 and reach a minimum openwrt</p><p>I tried both before, they worked.</p><p>But this time, a whole night of 5 hours, retry again and again, all failed.&nbsp; All I can see is the box bootup until Power and Air are on.&nbsp; I can see a non-secured wireless network named &quot;openwrt&quot;.&nbsp; Can connect to it.&nbsp; No dhcp.&nbsp; No 192.168.1.1 there.&nbsp; What about LAN?&nbsp; No, no 192.168.1.1 too.</p><p>How was this happen?&nbsp; I was setting up WDS with another Linksys WRT54G v1 (connecting to ADSL).&nbsp; It worked fine indeed.&nbsp; Perfect, I was happy.&nbsp; So I tried to swap them, connect Asus to ADSL instead.&nbsp; I simply &#039;reboot&#039; from ssh.&nbsp; Then, oops, can&#039;t connect back.</p><p>People suggested serial console but&nbsp; I have no idea of how to buy those electronic parts and put things together.</p><p>Should I send my box back to Asus.&nbsp; Will they help me?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cranberry</strong> on 27 Oct 2005, 05:03)</p>

					<p>I sent back to Asus and the engineer investigated for me.&nbsp; He said he could see 192.168.1.2 for few seconds at WAN port after bootup, but it disappeared after a while.&nbsp; On the other hand, he also found that the LAN port became &quot;hub mode&quot;.&nbsp; I asked what exactly he meaned but I failed to understand his explanation.&nbsp; Or I didn&#039;t really care because he was going to replace my box.</p><p>Tftp, flashing mode, boot wait, all work well at the new box now.</p>									</div>
