					<p>I just updated to 15.05, and everything went smoothly except for WiFi.&nbsp; My router isn&#039;t broadcasting an ssid, and on the WiFi luci page I get the message &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot; under my ssid.&nbsp; I tried disabling it and re-enabling it, as well as a full power cycle, and neither fixed the issue.</p><p>If I hit the scan button I do see some local access points show up, so it is obviously talking to the radio.</p><p>From a shell I can run:<br /># iwinfo radio0 info<br />radio0&nbsp; &nbsp; ESSID: unknown<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Access Point: 00:00:00:00:00:00<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode: Unknown&nbsp; Channel: unknown (unknown)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx-Power: unknown&nbsp; Link Quality: unknown/70<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Signal: unknown&nbsp; Noise: unknown<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate: unknown<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption: unknown<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Type: nl80211&nbsp; HW Mode(s): 802.11bgn<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hardware: 168C:002A 168C:A093 [Atheros AR9280]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX power offset: none<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frequency offset: none<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supports VAPs: yes&nbsp; PHY name: phy0</p><p>This is on a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH2.&nbsp; I performed the upgrade by uploading the sysupgrade firmware file via the luci interface, and I confirmed the md5sum before hitting proceed.</p><p>I don&#039;t mess with openwrt much beyond getting it working, so it is entirely possible I&#039;m missing something obvious, but I didn&#039;t find anything using Google that looked applicable.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, looks like running wifi detect as suggested on irc by borromini did the job.</p><p>Comparing my final configs, I think the issue was that I had an option wps_pushbutton in my original config.&nbsp; I never did get that to work, but it might be causing issues in the new version, or perhaps it causes issues if a module isn&#039;t installed.</p><p>In any case, I&#039;m back up and running, and simplifying my config was one of my goals anyway.</p>									</div>
