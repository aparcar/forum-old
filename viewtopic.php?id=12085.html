					<p>I am having wrt55ag v2 and I have searched this forum as well as ddwrt forums but there seem to be no support for this router. I see in the hardware section that it is based on Artheros 5312 and apparently the same is supported in kamikaze. </p><p>So, can I go ahead and flash the original firmware with kamikaze. Will there be any issue with that?</p><p>Any help on this matter would be really helpful.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>But I am not sure if it is supported or not. On the supported hardware it still displays that it is in WIP. But does it mean that kamikaze supports it?</p>									</div>

I have a couple of them which I got thinking they would be good accesspoints since they were dual band and cheap enough, only to find that even when not being asked to do routing the linksys firmware is trash, so if I lose them its not a big deal to me, and a non operational switch in it wont matter in the slightest to me.</p><p>I can get the stuff to make a jtag and console if needed.</p>									</div>
