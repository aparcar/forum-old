					<p>After the boot, the arp table looks like this:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# arp -a<br />IP address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HW type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flags&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HW address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mask&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Device<br />192.168.1.134&nbsp; &nbsp; 0x1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00:15:B7:B5:CD:65&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; br-lan<br />10.0.0.138&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00:00:00:00:00:00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.1<br />root@OpenWrt:~# </p><p>So my questions would be is there some reason the MAC address for the 10.0.0.138 is all zero (when of course it isn&#039;t), and is there some way to change this? I tried to delete it and add it manually, but it would always add all-zero MAC address.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
