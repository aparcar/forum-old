					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I have been using DDWRT for quite some time (absolutely love it) and I recently picked up a WNDR3700 because I knew it was supported, as long as you didn&#039;t have the V5 model. Well I ended up with the V5 model and I found out sadly DDWRT is not supported, but there were rumors that you could install LEDE on it, but the documentation from: <a href="http://ht%20tps://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56737&amp;p=1">ht tps://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.ph … 37&amp;p=1</a> was a little scattered and hard to follow.</p><p>Here is a step by step of how to install the most recent version of LEDE on your WNDR3700V5.<br /><span style="color: red">NOTE: I am not responsible for any damage/bricking of your router, all these steps have been performed on my router that was running the firmware version: 1.0.0.17. This in theory should work regardless of the firmware version.</span></p><p><span style="color: red">NOTE: I did not write the code behind this, build the binary images, or do any of the development on this router. I am simply providing some documentation on how to get LEDE on this router in the hopes of helping others.</span></p><p><span style="color: blue">INFO: I had to put a space between ht tp because I cannot post links, you will have to fix this when copying links.</span></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Step#1 Enable Telnet</strong><br />Enabling telnet on this router is fairly simple, grab the <em>telnetenable.exe</em> from: <a href="http://ht%20tps://github.com/insanid/NetgearTelnetEnable/blob/master/binaries/windows/telnetEnable.exe">ht tps://github.com/insanid/NetgearTeln … Enable.exe</a></p><p>Plug the your Desktop/Loptop into the one of the LAN ports on the back of the device, you can leave your Network IP settings the way they are. Ensure going to 192.168.1.1 opens Netgears web interface.</p><p>Open CMD and type </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>arp -a</code></pre></div><p>You should see a entry like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  192.168.1.1           c6-84-4b-4e-xx-xx     dynamic</code></pre></div><p>Run telnetenable.exe with the following options:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>telnetenable.exe 192.168.1.1 PHYSICALADDRESS admin password</code></pre></div><p><span style="color: red">NOTE: You must enter what arp -a says is the physical address in this format: C6844B4EXXXX. You also must capitalize each character for this to work. Also, don&#039;t change your web login info! It should be admin password.</span></p><p>Example: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>telnetenable.exe 192.168.1.1 C6844B4EXXXX admin password</code></pre></div><p>Now in CMD type:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>telnet 192.168.1.1</code></pre></div><p><span style="color: blue">NOTE: You will have to enable the telnet client on Windows if you haven&#039;t already. Just google &quot;Windows cmd enable telnet&quot;</span></p><p>You should be greeted with a # and a root terminal after running the telnet command.</p><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>Step#2 Replace bootloader</strong><br /><em>You will want to replace your bootloader on this device in case you run into trouble. This bootloader has a web recovery interface that allows us to upload binary images, this is important.</em></p><p>In the # root terminal we just opened via telnet and CMD (in the previous step), type:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd media</code></pre></div><p><span style="color: blue">NOTE: We have to cd to media because we need a place where we can read/write to the filesystem.</span></p><p>Plug a ethernet cable with internet into the WAN port (yellow one) on the back of the router and wait a few seconds. You should see the globe icon on the router light up, the router will need internet for this step.</p><p>Run the following command after the router shows on the front that it has internet:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget ht tp://xdd.co/router/pb-uboot-wndr3700v5.bin</code></pre></div><p>wget should say completed or something similar. If it says <em>read only filesystem</em> it means you have not yet ran this command: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd media</code></pre></div><p><span style="color: red">NOTE: You may also use this bootloader: <a href="http://ht%20tps://github.com/pinney/MT7621-u-boot-mod/blob/master/bin/MT7621S_uboot.bin">ht tps://github.com/pinney/MT7621-u-boo … _uboot.bin</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not tested this, but someone else said it was working from the thread I linked to at the very top of this post. I ran the bootloader from the command above, and it worked great.</span></p><p><span style="color: blue">INFO: If you want to use the alternative bootloader, run this command:</span><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget ht tp://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinney/MT7621-u-boot-mod/master/bin/MT7621S_uboot.bin</code></pre></div><br /><br /><p><strong>Now that you have your bootloader downloaded on the routers filesystem, you will need to run this command:</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd_write write pb-uboot-wndr3700v5.bin Bootloader</code></pre></div><p><span style="color: blue">INFO: If you used the alternative bootloader, you will need to use this command:</span><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd_write write MT7621S_uboot.bin Bootloader</code></pre></div><br /><br /><p><strong>Step#3 Enter Web Recovery</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: Before turning off the router, unplug the Ethernet cable in the wan port on the back of the router (yellow one)</strong></p><p>Now turn off the router (make sure the Ethernet cable in the wan port is unplugged) by pressing the power button on the back and letting the router completely power off. Take a paper clip or pen and press and hold the reset button on the back of the router, <span style="color: red">DO NOT LET GO OF THE RESET BUTTON YET</span>. While holding the reset button, push in the power button and let the router begin to turn on. The power LED should start flashing. <span style="color: blue">Wait 10 seconds and release the reset button.</span></p><p>With 10 seconds waited, and the reset button being released, the router power LED will continue to flash. This is normal. You should have the Ethernet cable from your Desktop/Laptop still plugged into the router and the Ethernet cable that was going into the WAN port (yellow one) on the router unplugged.</p><p>Change your Desktop/Laptop&#039;s network settings to have a static ip of 192.168.1.2, and a gateway of 192.168.1.1. You may be able to get away with not doing this, but this is what I did and it worked.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Step#4 Install LEDE</strong><br />Download the following bin file: <a href="http://ht%20tps://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.0/targets/ramips/mt7621/lede-17.01.0-r3205-59508e3-ramips-mt7621-wndr3700v5-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">ht tps://downloads.lede-project.org/rel … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>Navigate to 192.168.1.1 with your web browser, you should see a screen that says: &quot;Pandorbox&quot; and recovery. Select the bin file you downloaded and click upgrade/flash.</p><p><span style="color: blue">NOTE: If you do not see the recovery screen and you enter the Netgear web interface again, go back to Step#3 and refollow the last portion very carefully. You don&#039;t have to flash the bootloader again.</span></p><p>Once the recovery web interface begins flashing your router <strong>DO NOT TURN IT OFF</strong> or unplug anything, leave it be. This may take about 4-5 minutes. I think mine took maybe 3. Let it do it&#039;s job. Set a timer for 5 minutes, and come back.</p><p>The power LED may be off, the router isn&#039;t off don&#039;t worry. You should be able to now type 192.168.1.1 again in a new tab and be welcomed by the LEDE web interface. If you don&#039;t see it, wait a minute or two more and try powering off the router and turning it back on. You shouldn&#039;t have to though.</p><br /><br /><br /><p>I hope this helps and I really hope no one accidentally bricks their device doing this, I followed these steps and it worked for me. Let me know if you run into any problems. Be sure to thank everyone from the LEDE team who put together these binaries and thank you to: <strong>hikey</strong> and <strong>ldpinney</strong>, you guys really helped me!</p><p>Enjoy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>civilwarrock</strong> on 4 Oct 2017, 23:55)</p>
