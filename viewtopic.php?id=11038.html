					<p>Hi there...</p><p>after successfully doing the Ram-upgrades on the se505v1 I&#039;m&nbsp; now working on one of my other projects...</p><p>I have two bricked Ravo W54-RT lying here. The board is the RT210W, which is also used in the Belkin f5d7230 v1000, the Siemens se505V1, ...</p><p>now Eko from the dd-wrt-forum found the JTAG-pinout of these boards, giving the abillity to revive these routers!<br />see: <br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=5080">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=5080</a></p><p>mine connects fine too, but the W54-RT have another yet unsupported flash-chip.<br />they are equipped with the Fujitsu 29DL323BE-90PFTN.

					<p>You could try with adding this line to the end of flash_chip_list array in wrt54g.c :</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;{ 0x0004, 0x????, size2MB, CMD_TYPE_AMD, &quot;MBM29LV160B 4Mx16 BotB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(8MB)&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;, 8, size8K,&nbsp; &nbsp;15,size64K,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;48,size64K,&nbsp; 0,0 },</p><p>The second element in the array (0x????) must be replaced with what is read by wrt54g program from the device. Initially set is to 0x0000. When found out then replace with the actual value.</p><p>Count the number of active lines in the array (starting from 0 for the first active line). That is the position inside the array for the memory. Use this position in the command line. Lets assume the position is 56 then you should use /fc:56 in the command line.</p><p>Play first reading data several times and comparing the results before erasing or flashing anything. Remember it is always a good idea to make a full memory backup before erasing or writing anything.</p><p>The above information was taken from datasheet page 4.</p>									</div>
