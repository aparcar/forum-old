					<p>My system is a accesspoint. I would like to log in to it using Luci via smartphone, but as it get its Ip-address from DHCP, I don&#039;t know its IP-address and it can also differ once in a while. How do I solve this without creating a static-IP?</p>									</div>

					<p>The solution is generally to use a static IP.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or make a reservation in the DHCP server of the device that is giving out DHCP.</p><p>You could also create another virtual AP for administration, and connect it to the LAN.&nbsp; It would have a constant address regardless of the network that is being bridged through the main access point.</p>									</div>
