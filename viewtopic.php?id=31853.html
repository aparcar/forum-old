					<p>Hi, </p><p>Which VPN are you using? Openvpn, vpnc,... ?<br />I never had problems with openvpn to get an persistant tunnel, keepalive/reconnect seems to be implemented right. So you probably just need to configure it right. </p><p>vpnc on the other hand isn&#039;t designed for this kind of operation<br />I had this problem with an openwrt-box with vpnc which connects to a cisco-box. <br />I searched for a solution to get a persistent tunnel and found something related to openwrt (kamikaze), something for debian, and nothing did really work... <br />So I didn&#039;t come up with this stuff, it&#039;s mostly from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=13980">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=13980</a><br />but this setup is a bit outdated and really complex so I just used the keepalive-script and made an init-script myself, and it is working for some weeks now. </p><p>I have this init-script so that I can start/stop/restart vpnc&nbsp; (when I have time, I will make a proper init-script, but this one works, ok )</p><p>/etc/init.d/vpnc</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

case &quot;$1&quot; in
    start)
       echo &quot;Starting vpnc connections...&quot;
        /usr/sbin/vpnc
    ;;

    stop)
        echo &quot;Stopping vpnc...&quot;
        vpnc-disconnect &amp;

    ;;

    restart)
        echo &quot;Restarting vpnc...&quot;
        vpnc-disconnect &amp;
        sleep 5
        vpnc
esac
exit 0</code></pre></div><p>a script that pings 2 host on the other side of the tunnel and if it get no answer from any of them the vpnc is restarted</p><p>/usr/local/sbin/vpn-keepalive<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#
# Restart VPNC if both of the specified hosts on the command line are unavailable

if ! [ $(ping -q -c 1 ${1} 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep &quot;1 packets received&quot; | sed &quot;s/.*\(1\) packets received.*/\1/&quot;) ] ||
   ! [ $(ping -q -c 1 ${2} 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep &quot;1 packets received&quot; | sed &quot;s/.*\(1\) packets received.*/\1/&quot;) ]; then
    echo Not alive $1 or $2, restarting VPNC
    /etc/init.d/vpnc restart
else
echo Alive $1 or $2
fi</code></pre></div><p>and I run this script every minute using cron to see if 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.10 are reachable: <br />crontab -e<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>* * * * *  /usr/local/sbin/vpnc-keepalive 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.10 &amp;</code></pre></div><p>thats all! <br />and this should be adaptable for any kind of vpn, you just need a &quot;restart&quot; or &quot;reconnect&quot;-command for it</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 13 Sep 2011, 20:32)</p>

					<p>hmm... I&#039;m not sure if I can follow you<br />if you can ping a host behind the tunnel, than the tunnel is still up. If you are not able to send packages from the lan behind your router to the lan behind the vpn-server, it sound more like a routing/firewall issue. </p><p>But if restarting openvpn fixes your issue, you could run this script form a client in your lan, and if it cannot ping you could restart openvpn through ssh on the router.</p>									</div>
