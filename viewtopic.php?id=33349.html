					<p>I am trying to achieve modem access through my TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND v1.8 running Backfire 10.03.1-RC6. My computer OS is Windows 7.</p><p>The TL-WR1043ND&#039;s IP is 192.168.1.1 and my modem&#039;s IP is 192.168.2.1. I had no issues with Gargoyle which automatically detected the modem to allow access but wifi stability was lacking so I&#039;m trying OpenWRT.</p><p>I have tried following the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/access.modem.through.nat">Accessing your modem HOWTO</a> but I don&#039;t understand how to use uCi or LuCi if possible to set IP Aliases.</p><p>Is uCi like command prompt allowing low level access?</p><p>Is there any way to allow modem access from LuCi to simplify matters?</p><p>I have very little experience with Linux.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know about modem access but rc6 had a bug on my WR1043ND. Wireless connection dropped after awhile and I needed to restart the router to get online again. I used the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">snapshot</a> instead and it works OK now for a week.</p><p>Keep in mind that snapshots does not come with the web interface installed. You need to <strong>telnet</strong> into your modem and set the root password with <strong>passwd</strong>. Then you need to <strong>ssh</strong> into the modem as the root user and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">install LuCI.</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapir</strong> on 7 Dec 2011, 09:24)</p>

					<p>Check your firewall rule, i had no problem accessing modem after firmware upgrade from the beginning.</p><p>Set your wan port as a dhcp client and let your modem do the dhcp server.</p><p>By default Openwrt will occupy 192.168.1.x network and dont touch it, change your modem default network from 192.168.1.x to another one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xopal</strong> on 8 Dec 2011, 06:47)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve changed the password and have SSH&#039;ed into the TL-WR1043ND using Putty but I&#039;m unsure how to go about making changes using UCI. It doesn&#039;t seem straight forward at all.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried looking for guides on UCI but it all still isn&#039;t obvious to me.</p><p>From the wiki&#039;s first step how do you &quot;Head towards /etc/config/network and add these lines&quot;?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kingnick</strong> on 11 Dec 2011, 19:34)</p>

					<p>Well the wiki assumes that you know the basic principles of a Linux command line. If it tells you to &quot;add&quot; or &quot;change&quot; something in a file it implies that you should use a text editor to add the outlined changes. The default text editor is &quot;vi&quot;, so read up on that.</p>									</div>
