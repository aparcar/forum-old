					<p>hi</p><p>what i would like to achieve is to have my dmz-connected visitors to be able to access services by wan ip that will be redirected to another zone, let&#039;s say lan.</p><p>openwrt wan - 12.23.34.45<br />client is sitting in dmz - 192.168.2.101<br />httpd is in lan - 192.168.1.2, configured for vhost someservice.net (resolves to 12.23.34.45)</p><p>now dmz guy tries to access someservice.net with his browser and therefore will try to connect to 12.23.34.45:80, which in my imagination should go through wan zone, then get redirected back to lan. </p><p>somewhere along the chains openwrt blocks this, because this connection does not succeed.</p><p>my traffic control configuration currently looks like this:<br /> * lan -&gt; wan<br /> * dmz -&gt; wan<br /> * lan -&gt; vpn<br /> * lan -&gt; dmz</p><p>any pointers welcome!</p>									</div>
