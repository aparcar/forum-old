					<p>Hi!<br />I finally tried to put openWRT to my router, but something went wrong and it&#039;s now a brick. It doesn&#039;t respond to pings, nor does it get an IP address with DHCP (from another router).<br />I tried the firmware openwrt-motorola-jffs2.bin and followed the instructions that appears at <a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Motorola/WR850G">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Motorola/WR850G</a>, using the motorola firmware update page. After flashing the new firmware, the router posted a message stating that the upload had been successful and that it was needed to reboot in order changes to take effect. I rebooted and waited for about 15 min but nothing appeared on screen. It didn&#039;t respond to ping nor telnet and I couldn&#039;t reset it anyway.</p><p>I&#039;m reading about making a short in the flash chip while rebooting, but I cannot find any information on which is the chip I have to short (everything stated is about linksys). In addition to this I don&#039;t know which pins are to be shorted. Some websites say it&#039;s 9 &amp; 10 but others say it&#039;s 15 &amp; 16. Any help on this? The only chip I can see on the board (there is a smaller board on top of the rest of the ICs from which the antenna cable is going out) has this written on it: AM29LV320DB. It is rectangular with 24 pins to each narrow side (with a total of 48 pins). I have photos in case it helps better identify the model (I think it&#039;s REV 1) and the chips.</p><p>Any suggestion or information/redirection will be deeply appreciated as I&#039;d like to recover my router from death.</p><p>Thanks. LtGoose.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am not sure, but your 2x10 pins connector really looks like a JTAG one, same cabling method (2,4,6,8 are grounded).</p><p>The bootloader is a kind of program that tells the system where the linux kernel is.</p><p>I think you will have to make your own JTAG cable.

					<p>I&#039;ve managed to reflash the old Motorola 4.03 firmware to the router. It was a matter of luck, because I was just driven by desperation <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> After trying everything I had read, I finally gave the pin-short a try. As everything else I had already tried... it didn&#039;t work. However, I started shorting pins (don&#039;t know which, by the way) and noticed a change in the led pattern... the power led just stayed lit, without flashing every 6 seconds... GOOD! Furthermore, I noticed that pings started to respond and finally, the tftp worked!!</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to upload different versions of the openwrt firmware, but none really worked. Even the last snapshot that was supposed to work with this modem didn&#039;t produce any effect. I finally tried the 4.03 firmware (tftp-ing it) and voilÃ¡! it rebooted automatically and the WiFi led started to blink again!!!</p><p>So I have brought it from the abyss, but still have had no luck with openwrt. So I&#039;ll have to start again from scratch.</p><p>It is strange, but when I go to frame_debug.asp page and write nvram set boot_wait=on or whatever, I get no response. The page loads again, but nothing else happens. Does someone know what is it supposed to output? I&#039;ve read that you can list the nvram variables using this page, but I get no output from my commands. Is it possible that my HW version is not fully compatible with openwrt or with this bug used to set boot_wait?</p><p>As usual, any help/comment/redirection will be gratefully appreciated.<br />LtGoose.</p>									</div>

					<p>LtGoose,</p><p>Although I have no additional advice for you, I can provide some comfort that misery likes company.</p><p>From your picture youâ€™ve got a board that is laid out the same as mine, and apparently your luck with openWRT follows my experience as well.&nbsp; Eventually I figured out the firmware trick, I can load (and have loaded) any firmware out there.&nbsp; However I can only get the various Mot versions I have on hand (5.13 / 4.03) to work properly.&nbsp; </p><p>After a scary set of rolling reboots (I believe this was caused by a metal flake shorting two of the flash pins together) I got it running.&nbsp; Then I followed the directions to clear the NV ram and that was the last time I was able to successfully load openWRT.</p><p>With quick fingers you can hit the firmware load window by waiting for the four Ethernet link lights to extinguish, then start the tftp.&nbsp; Even with boot_wait disabled I hit the window 90% of the time now.&nbsp; (Guess my video game reflexes are good for something.)&nbsp; Since I was up late, I cannot provide any detailed diagnostics on how I got the darn thing to work.&nbsp; I do remember that the WAN interface took on the LAN addresses at one point.&nbsp; However after clearing the NVRAM it never loaded openwrt again.&nbsp; But it is a happy little Franken-router with 5.13 on it.&nbsp; (Missing face plate, case held together by rubber bandsâ€¦)&nbsp; The fact I can, seemingly, always get back to the MOT firmware is a comfort and has enabled additional, yet fruitless, experimentation.</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp; I have given up on this particular router and am pondering trying my hand with another victim.&nbsp; However all the available candidates are currently in service so need to make some decisions.</p><p>Regards,</p><br /><p>Matthew</p>									</div>

					<p>yawlhoo,</p><p>I tried yesterday to upload the stable 2005.02.02 version while recovering the router from death, but couldn&#039;t boot from it. Perhaps if I try it from scratch again, it could work. However, I can&#039;t say whether the frame_debug.asp page is working properly for me or not. Do you remember the effects of writing commands on the debug page? Any output on screen?<br />Do you remember what you exactly did to tftp the firmware? Did you start tftp&#039;ing it upon reboot, with boot_wait on or just while it was on running the moto firmware? Detailed explanations would help me a lot, really, because I&#039;m following your instructions of the other post with no luck.</p><p>I cannot see any 4-hole serial port on my board (take a look at the photo above), so perhaps they are not the same version. Can you tell me if your router is black or silver, has a detachable antenna or not or any other significant mark that could help me know if mine is the same version as yours?</p><p>Thanks a lot for the help.

					<p>Hi again.<br />I finally managed to put openWRT in the Motorola WR850G v.1. It was a complete surprise to see it booting this firmware, because I had been trying for a looong time with many different FWs and nothing happened (apart from bricking it). I believe now that the main problem was the old motorola firmware, that didn&#039;t allow me to use the frame_debug.asp page properly. Or perhaps the MS explorer web browser. After more than a week trying to get any output from the nvram commands, I finally got it using Konqueror with debian. After that, I only had to find the suitable firmware. I don&#039;t know if the file extension is also a problem. Perhaps I&#039;ll check it later on.</p><p>Just in case anybody finds this of help, I&#039;ll explain what I did to put the firmware on this router.<br />- First of all, manage to set boot_wait=on in the nvram, using original motorola firmware v4.03 in the frame_debug.asp web page.<br />- You should get a long list of variables as output. Sometimes I got a message saying &#039;invalid command&#039;, but I think it committed the change. However, you can keep on trying the command (as long as it is well written) and it should work anytime.<br />- Download the firmware <a href="http://openwrt.org/downloads/experimental/bin/openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin">openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin</a> and save it in your working directory.<br />- Put default configuration in your router, to make it easier to ping to upon reflashing.<br />- Configure your network card to have a convenient IP address (192.168.10.2 for example)<br />- When you have set boot_wait=on and committed the changes, you should unplug the power plug from the router.<br />- Prepare the tftp transfer with the following commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftp 192.168.10.1
binary
rexmt 1
trace
verbose
put openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin</code></pre></div><p>- After hitting return in the last line, plug in again the router power cable and wait until you see the transfer taking place.<br />- If a timeout error shows, you should repeat the previous steps timing better the put command with the router plugging in.<br />- If no error occurred, then you&#039;ll se a transfere complete message or at least, see a bunch of messages stating how many packets were transferred. If everything when ok, the router will reboot automatically. Wait until you can ping or telnet to it again.<br />- Running telnet 192.168.10.1 should let you open a session in your freshly-flashed openwrt router.<br />- You should have a look at general openwrt documentation in order to configure properly your new firmware, but that get&#039;s far beyond my knowledge. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />[/list]</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p>LtGoose</p>									</div>
