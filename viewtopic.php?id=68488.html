					<p>Hi.</p><p>I have an OpenWRT on TP-Link 1043ND.<br />It is used as an OpenVPN-Server with the following in the /etc/config/openvpn file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>package openvpn

					<p>TAP is an ethernet bridge operating at layer 2. It doesn&#039;t really care about IPs or routes. Are you sure you shouldn&#039;t be using a tun device instead? The bridging setup is mostly designed for clients that are in the same IP range on either side of the tunnel.</p><p>You can probably fix this by defining some static routes in the OpenWrt networking menu page, assuming that the openvpn clients are using their tap device as the default route.</p>									</div>

					<p>I need an IP from the remote (customer) network, but there isno need to reach IPs in my office network, so I use TAP for connections to the hardware devices in the remote network (with Siemens Step7 or TIA). Most of them are connected directly to the network. But some of them have their own IP-Network, because they connect via GPRS/LTE and OpenVPN to the customer network either, but I need to reach them too. At the moment, I add the three networks manually <br />route add 192.168.100.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1<br />route add 192.168.101.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1<br />route add 192.168.102.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1<br />where 192.168.0.1 is the address of the OpenVPN-Router in the customer network.<br />But I would like to have that been done automatically at connection time.<br />Aksels</p>									</div>

					<p>The Syntax in /etc/config/openvpn is different.<br />I really would like to put those push directives in, but I cant find the syntax.<br />If nobody knows, I change to /etc/openvpn/server2.conf (since I already have a server.conf).<br />But if that fails, I have to drive 1h to the customer to fix it.<br />Thought it would be easier to put in /etc/config/openvpn.</p><p>Aksels</p>									</div>
