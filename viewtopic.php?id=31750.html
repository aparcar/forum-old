					<p>Hi all. I have just bought a new router TP-LINK WR1043ND, version 1.8. Being a dd-wrt user with my old and lost Linksys WRT300N 1.1, I would like to ask some questions to experts here before flashing. I was reading the forum yesterday and today and there are items not clear for me to understand. So I would like to test OpenWRT with this router, and if found reliable, stick with it. Router is brand new, with stock firmware. I have not set it up yet.</p><p>The questions are:</p><p>1. Is the file openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory the one to use to flash the router?<br />2. Will I have access thorugh Web GUI just after installing the above firmware?<br />3. Last one. I downloaded above firmware from here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc5/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ c5/ar71xx/</a>. Is it ok?</p><p>I would not like to brick the router too soon!! Thank you very much for your replies and recommendations.<br />Bye.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. Yes, I read it all, but still with doubts. It is mentioned there to download rc4, although I downloaded rc5 because I think wiki is not yet updated. But it is not clear for me if there will be access via WEB GUI after installing firmware (just after installing), or if there are some steps necessary. I have also doubts about wifi. Firmware is about 8 MB, I think it may have WIFI and WEB GUI, but I&#039;m not sure, I&#039;m new to openwrt and I prefer not to make something wrong so soon. Thank you for replying.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>written_direcon wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Have you looked at the Wiki at all?
