					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I have a headache about the l2tp vpn.</p><p>I just find out that I can&#039;t dial L2TP vpn (linux openswan xl2tp) from a network behind my openwrt router, but if I switch&nbsp; to a regular router , then it could work perfectly.</p><p>And, I even can&#039;t dial pptp vpn (linux pptpd), which leads me to this post (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.nat.pptp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.nat.pptp</a>)<br />Due to my poor computer network knowledge , I can&#039;t really understand why openwrt can&#039;t let GRE packet passing though.</p><p>But according to this wiki , I should install a special mod to overcome this problem , since it&#039;s for PPTP vpn , so I am wondering , is it also the same reason that I can&#039;t dial L2TP vpn?</p><p>Or is there any similar software package I should use?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
