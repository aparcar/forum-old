					<p>I have a Seagate drive that is connected to a lower end Mac Mini which is on 24/7. The drive is using the original NTFS format. My Mac is using a third party NTFS driver. I am a Windows &amp; Mac user and don&#039;t have any dedicated Linux machines. My main use of the drive, beyond backups, is to serve media to my desktops and mobile devices. This is with simple file sharing, FTP, Plex, and XBMC.</p><p>I would like to see if I could retire the Mac Mini from 24/7 duty and host the drive on my OpenWrt router. My TP-LINK TL-3600 has two USB 2 ports. Is OpenWrt capable of hosting a Seagate 3 TB drive as a Samba network drive, FTP server, and DLNA server? The format will remain NTFS.</p><p>If above is NOT feasible or reliable, I can always revert back to my current setup on the Mac Mini. The notion of hosting the drive from the router is intriguing, because of reduced energy usage.</p><p>Steve</p><p>TP-LINK TL-WDR3600<br />OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)</p>									</div>

					<p>I have 1TB drive connected to a wr1043nd router with samba and I have r/w speeds 8-10MB/s with ext4 filesystem on it, I&#039;m using it a year or so nonstop and it is almost perfect. I don&#039;t know hows about NTFS performance, but I&#039;d reformat to native linux FS. Your router is more powerful than mine, you might expect higher speed, but I don&#039;t think you will get full 30MB/s what can USB2.0 supply. If you don&#039;t mind slower speed, openwrt has all the features you are talking about.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 10 Jan 2014, 22:58)</p>

					<p>There might be a performance drop when you connect USB storage to the router.</p><p>Max. USB2 speed is ~40MB/s.<br />With encrypted connections (SSH/SFTP or FTPS) i only get 2-3MB/s from a connected USB harddisk on my WDR3600.<br />Writing on the USB2 disk from the router is between 20MB/s (only zeroes from /dev/zero) to 1MB/s (random data from router)<br />The router is running openvpn + some minor stuff in the background.<br />I cannot try DLNA on it, because i dont have enough space left on the flash of my device (but if you only have DLNA, FTP, Samba you should be fine)</p><p>I dont know the power state of a Mac Mini but current PC Hardware can get down to ~5W Idle<br />see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJWG8O6Pnmk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJWG8O6Pnmk</a> (without Display, LAN, USB devices) or 10W (&quot;normal&quot; idle)</p><p>You could setup Wake on LAN (WOL) with OpenWrt</p><p>Edit: My &quot;low&quot; performance might be because OpenVPN is running ... someone should write some wiki pages similar to the OpenSSL benchmark ones<br />Edit2: oh <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/performance">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/performance</a> found <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zloop</strong> on 10 Jan 2014, 23:19)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m beginning to think it&#039;s best not to put a heavily used external drive on the router itself.</p><p>I&#039;m noticing issues with the drive being accessed through my Mac Mini from a Windows PC. I&#039;m using imaging software called Macrium Reflect, which creates a mountable image of one of my Windows partitions. After mounting image over the network, I kept getting errors saying the image was corrupted. So I moved the image to another USB drive and hooked it directly to the PC and mounted it locally. The errors went away. The image file is nearly 300 GB, so it&#039;s obvious that mounting over a network is not trivial.</p><p>These problems occurred when using the Mac Mini to host the USB drive as a network share. I can only imagine what it would be like if I accessed it through the router.</p><p>I found it interesting product called an NAS adapter. </p><p><a href="http://www.addonics.com/category/nas_adapter.php">http://www.addonics.com/category/nas_adapter.php</a></p><p>It looks like it could be the solution I&#039;ve been looking for. It converts any USB drive to a network drive through an ethernet connection. It should take the processing load off of my underpowered Mac Mini. I may check it out sometime soon.</p><p>Also somebody commented on the power of PCs in standby mode. My Mac Mini in question is rated by Apple at 10 watts in idle mode.</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>
