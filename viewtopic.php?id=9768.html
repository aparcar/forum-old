					<p>I realize this is not the correct forum, but it looks like the IXP forum is swamped with spam and unmaintained so one quick question - &gt; Does anyone know of OpenIXP and whether it&#039;s as reliable as OpenWRT? Can I just load&nbsp; a wvr54g with the firmware and have it running without any hardware mods? The random text in the hardware guide is not easy to follow.</p>									</div>

					<p>No one want&#039;s to talk about OpenIXP? It sounds like and interesting project, and it does run OpenWRT. I just wish there was decent forum specifically for it, but like I said it&#039;s just spammed like hell.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I saw it for sale, bundled with a 4-port DSL modem (some GNET), for 80$. I need the modem and the router looked pretty sweet, but I don&#039;t know if I could really integrate it into my network to my satisfaction if there&#039;s no OpenWRT. I gather it&#039;ll be a long time before it&#039;s added.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I wish I could help you guys with it somehow, but it&#039;ll be year before I know enough about this stuff!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>napierzaza</strong> on 12 Mar 2007, 17:21)</p>
