					<p>hi folks,</p><p>i tried a lot some time ago, but did not find a solution. i tried various kernel patches i found on the net, but nothing helped. so i stopped trying after a lot of unsuccessful compiling and stuff. but i did this already some time ago, don&#039;t know if situation changed. my rspro is still running kamikaze, but i already decided to upgrade to backfire and i will give it some more tries then. i just need some time for that. the last thing i remember is that there is probably some problem with 32bit io-cards and the ar71xx kernel tree... but that is not sure. i also posted on ubiquiti forums when i was trying to solve the problem, there dfarrell stated the following:</p><br /><p>Nothing learned we did not already know from the config file. I did look at the PCI setup for the ar71xx device. To me I cannot find a place that 1K IO space is mapped to the ar71xx memory space. This looks like quite a task to get this (or any other io space ) device to work. Someone with the ar71xx docs would have to review this. This is also a OpenWrT issue more than a ubnt one. </p><br /><p>so i did create some openwrt bug report (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6705">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6705</a>), but it did not seem that someone fixed the problem. I still hope that a new kernel version will help.</p><p>greetz</p><p>jan</p>									</div>

					<p>btw: i dont have issues with sdio, my sd-card works as fast as a memory stick connected to the usb-port. but my intension is having moooooooore diskspace and some software raid 1. there is still no cheap, fast and low-current hardware for that, so it&#039;s still my aim to get everything up &#039;n running.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your problem exists in the Linux kernel itself,not OpenWrt. I filed a bug report quite a while ago with Redhat because I was using Fedora and Alan Cox (who now works for Intel) was the maintainer:</p><p><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=444543">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=444543</a></p><p>This isn&#039;t exactly your chip but it&#039;s in the same category.</p><p>There was a patch that made its way into Redhat&#039;s&nbsp; bugzilla, but it didn&#039;t solve the problem. Since not enough people have complained it hasn&#039;t been fixed. I think the right place to complain would be on the main kernel.org bugzilla.</p><p>Gus</p>									</div>
