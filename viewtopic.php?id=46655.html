					<p>Hello,</p><p>for range-maximization on my home-network I am running one WiFi-Router (A) with openWRT and two other routers (B, C) as simple AP for wireless roaming, connected via LAN-cable with the router A.<br />Maybe I did something really wrong, but I don&#039;t know what.<br />The problem is that throughput via the APs (B) and (C) is really poor, and e.g. my tablet I have to reconnect every day to work. Without doing so after a day there&#039;s absolutely no throughput. The wireless channels are wide away (1, 6 and 11), the ssid and the wifi-password are all the same. I never got error-messages, only one time with connectbot (android-app) I got &quot;no route to host&quot;.<br />I try to describe my network:<br />On all devices latest trunk ar71xx r38303 is running, but the problem occurs a long time. On router (A) a &quot;normal&quot; configuration is running. It is working as router after a DSL-modem and is handling the connection. dnsmasq is running, most wireless-devices are installed as devices with known MAC and therefore statip IP-address. On the other routers (B) and (C) I&#039;ve stopped and disabled dnsmasq and firewall, so th√§t they are working as simple access-points. Most devices, especially my Androids, are getting a static IP and connected with it.</p><p>/etc/config/network on (A), a Buffalo Airstation WZR-HP-AG300H:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /etc/network
