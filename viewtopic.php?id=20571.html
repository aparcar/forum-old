					<p>hey folks... i know its a really old router but still... it&#039;s nice.</p><p>i just got into this router firmware stuff, and i only had this one compatible router laying around. so, i put kamikaze 8.09 on it yesterday. everything was great, i even made it connect to my WGR614 v6 wirelessly and bridged it to the lan, it was awesome! so then i decided to try making it work on WEP. i added WEP on the WGR614, went into the WGT634U and changed the client network settings to match for WEP. i used a generated key of 5572555394. i entered this key into the WGT634U, but it would not associate. so i decided to the change the key format to 55:72:55:53:94... still no connection. so i decided to do more research before i went further. the WGT634U was working just fine, and i unplugged it, did some more research, and decided to give a couple more options a try... so i plugged in the WGT634U, it seemed to power up OK, but it will not hand out IPs. I cannot connect to it anymore in any way. it *was* set to 192.168.5.1...</p><p>i can connect the WGT634U&#039;s wan port to the WGR614&#039;s lan ports, and it shows up in the WGR614 web interface under dhcp clients, but the IP is 192.168.1.1, and the MAC address is in fact that of the WGT634U. i try changing the WGR614 to a different IP, and it does no good - afterwards the wgt634u will not show up in the dhcp clients table of the WGR614... strange.</p><p>the other funny part is that when connected like this, if i connect my computer directly to the wgt634u, the computer pulls an IP from the wgr614... and the internet passes on through too, like the wgt634u isnt even there. HELP!</p><p>keep in mind i did this all using the OpenWRT web-based interface. i do not have a serial adapter or cable or anything i can hack up to make one with... unfortunately i am broke and cant order a cable, even though i have found a nokia CA-42/DKU-5 online for less than $5 *shipped*. any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re not getting an address via DHCP, set a static IP on your PC and connect to one of the LAN ports on the WGT634U.<br />Fire up nmap and/or Wireshark if you still can&#039;t talk to it.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok well i took your suggestions... having no internet i had no idea what to do with nmap. i put what i think the router should be, 192.168.5.1 into the Target field... no hosts found. tried it with 192.168.1.1 also. ran wireshark... kinda reminds me of commview. so i hooked up to the lan ports, set a static ip in windows - 192.168.5.2 and no gateway. started capturing packets on that interface. the router seems to be sending out DHCP Discovery packets, but the IP area shows 0.0.0.0 and but the Ethernet II area shows &quot;Netgear_x&quot; where X is the last portion of it&#039;s MAC, and it is correct. if i unplug the power from the router and plug it back in, my ethernet card starts sending out stuff like &quot;router solicitation&quot; or something... at ONE packet, the netgear appears with a 192.168.1.1 ip, it shows as a UDP packet, source port 59959, destination port 4919... i dunno... still can&#039;t ping that IP no matter what i do with the windows ip configuration. any suggestions?</p><p>btw i have internet now at home so its all good... just need some ideas now! thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sinteger</strong> on 5 Jun 2009, 02:38)</p>

					<p>Have you tried failsafe mode?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used it, so you&#039;ll have to read up.<br />Serial console is about the only other advise I have.</p>									</div>

					<p>argh... i did some searching and it appears that failsafe isnt working on the wgt634u... and apparently that one packet sent out over the lan port coming from the router with a 192.168.1.1 is the packet sigifying &quot;hit reset now to enter failsafe mode&quot; and i am trying that but no changes. any other ideas? i am gonna try to order up a nokia cable to hack up into a serial interface cable...</p>									</div>

					<p>ok scratch the no difference part about hitting the reset for failsafe... i dug around that packet some more, and it seems that if i hit the reset at the right time, another packet comes from the router: entering failsafe mode. after that i get no more packets from the router, with the exception of ONE time... i had my pc set to 192.168.1.10, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.1.1, and on one attempt, a third packet came from the router directly to my pc - &quot;192.168.1.1 is at (mac address of the router!)&quot; this seemed promising, but still a letdown since i still cant seem to get anywhere with it...</p>									</div>

					<p>and yet some more good news... with some patience, the router is now being more talkative. it responds to packets sent to it, but still no dhcp or web interface. it does reply to pings on 192.168.1.1... and ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>well... the good news: telnet worked. i was able to get into the router, wget a firmware file off my pc, and mtd flash it. it worked just fine. then i went in through the web interface to install madwifi, waited over 10 mins for it to restart, got nothing. unplugged it and plugged it back in, and again my computer pulled an ip from the wgr614v6 on the other side of the wgt634u. i figured crap now i gotta do it all over again... but alas, now i cant seem to find a single packet coming from the wgt634u now. im wondering if the router isn&#039;t just plain dead.</p><p>ordered a nokia CA-42 for $3.68 shipped.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sinteger</strong> on 5 Jun 2009, 21:28)</p>
