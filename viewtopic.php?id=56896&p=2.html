I fully understood the choices beforehand. In light of this, neither of you gave a straight answer to the precise answer. <strong>Why</strong> do you feel it mandatory to make the Web GUI/configuration interface of a router completely self contained in general? What if said GUI could have mobile apps for connecting to the router?

Note that they have all kinds of funky tools preloaded. Do note that automated/bulk remote management of equipment is much more feasible than logging in and altering settings in each router one by one from a GUI anyway. So ideally you shouldn&#039;t be doing much besides equipment replacement on site, because power cycling can also be done remotely if you are classy. I hear you crying for basic status indication, however most devices have LEDs for this purpose and at a higher level, the only important status is whether the device can be managed remotely or not. If the cabling is in error or there exist complex interference, the technician will need to bring specialized equipment anyway. If the device shows signs of a hardware fault or a software bug, it will need to be replaced and inspected at HQ because it is usually difficult to debug or even just tell apart on site. The usual and cheapest procedure goes like if power cycling didn&#039;t help, replace components until the system starts working again, inspect or recycle the ruins later.</p><p>If I&#039;d need to adjust settings on a desert island, I would have surely had all tools already loaded on my devices. Or even have a backup on the distributed storage of them locally, but that&#039;s besides the point.</p>									</div>

					<p>bkil... first, I am neither a significant contributor to the OpenWrt project, nor am I a network professional. Please consider my answer being my opinion in the light of what I personally expect OpenWrt to be.</p><p>I think one target audience for OpenWrt are people with one or possibly a few standard routers in their home. They want to use OpenWrt instead of OEM firmware for different (good or bad) reasons. I think most people here agree that OpenWrt is not as newbie friendly as we would want it to be. Adding notes (here and there) on the Wiki telling: before you make your changes you need to download Xxx from the internet and install it on your client device (specific instructions for iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc) would not improve newbie friendliness.

I guess a start would be to work with shell scripts, ssh, and possibly the web service / rpc capabilities that are already there (I honestly don&#039;t know much about how it works).</p><p>If you want to innovate/design a remote-central-control-center for OpenWrt, it sounds very cool! And I think it would be good if OpenWrt exposes relevant functions as (REST) APIs (again, I don&#039;t know the current state). But I think it will always have lower priority (to OpenWrt as a project) than<br /> 1) The shell and core system<br /> 2) An integrated and self contained web administration tool</p><p>Perhaps I am missing the point?</p>									</div>

I&#039;m pretty sure had AngularJS (or maybe React) been around when LuCI2 development started, the developers would not have bothered to create their own routines. In a way, AngularJS has overtaken the similar efforts of the LuCI2 development (and I certainly don&#039;t mean that as an insult to all the hard work that has gone towards LuCI2, it&#039;s just been in development so long that this happened).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 17 May 2015, 13:51)</p>

					<p>Hi All!</p><p>As an angular developer myself I am slightly confused about the development of this thread.<br />I see three OpenWrt-administration-scenarios:<br /> 1) The current LuCl<br /> 2) An AngularJS-based LuCl-replacement<br /> 3) Something like bkil envisioned in #28.</p><p>I may initially in this thread have been overly pessimistic about the download size of the Angular framework itself, if it was to be hosted on the router. The idea of replacing JQuery with Angular, and replacing LuCl with an Angular-based-LuCl is very appealing to me!<br />It requires two things:<br /> 1) That most things can be done via nice REST APIs (but I guess this is no different from the current LuCl solution)<br /> 2) That the entire Angular-LuCl-packages are not significantly bigger than the current LuCl-package.<br />I like this!</p><p>When it comes to the grand ideas that bkil are envisioning, they clearly require things that are not contained within OpenWrt itself (as we think of it today). I am good with that! And bkils ideas will much benefit from the clear REST APIs that will also enable a good Angular-LuCl. But I think the core self-contained WebGui of OpenWrt (be it Angular based or not) is a critical core component of a successful OpenWrt, regardless of the possible progress of bkils ideas.</p><p>That said, as much as I appreciate that bkil took the time to share his vision of a future OpenWrt in #28. I have not thought of those things myself. I personally think it sounds like a little royal nightmare. But that is probably just because I AM backwards. And it is not up to me to stop great visionary initiatives if some people want to build them and other people want to use them!</p><p>Edit: There are clearly many great ideas in #28!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 16 May 2015, 10:05)</p>

However, I feel that LuCi is such a mature project that it is not as open to innovation as you are. Again there is still no disagreement between most of us. I&#039;ve been in the works of making plans for such a project for a year now which is actually only a small part of a much bigger picture. I don&#039;t think that I will open a new thread for the discussion of such a system because I am not in the need of input at this point in time. I only thought that you would be interested in possible future use cases that you could consider during development and in arguments justifying support.</p><p>Let&#039;s rephrase <em>native installer wizard</em> to <strong>offline installer wizard</strong>. I was only implying native executables in my comments to make it easier to imagine because most are not familiar with the power of the web. By using the phrase <em>downloading and installing</em>, we don&#039;t need to limit ourselves to languages other than Javascript. Consider that the link of the installer could point to the Chrome Web Store (<em>or App Store/Google Play for your tablet</em>). It could even use ActionScript or a Java applet if you are into that kind of thing. The emphasis is on permitting single-click installation and offline usage. Well, it sounds a bit perverted, but you could very well host the package locally on the device itself.</p><p>Great new projects like Luci2 or this AngularJs based one make possible decoupling of the architecture to Model-View-Controller with style. The possibility of serving parts of a given tool from places other than a tightly embedded device is then given. Afterwards, the thought of making local storage of all components optional is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Note that I am not principally against hosting the most basic tools locally - I would rather make that optional. You could think of it as a local cache.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkil</strong> on 16 May 2015, 11:29)</p>

And this is exactly what we are aiming at, I think everyone of us. It is supposed to be self contained - as in a single firmware file that has everything. But what I think is quite fascinating is that considering the current development towards exposing more stuff through rpc is that it is already possible to build a desktop applet that would for example allow the user to control their firewall on the router by right clicking on a tray icon. This would of course require some kind of local server to which all applets can connect so that they would not have to authenticate with the router every time. But the fact that it is already possible to do it is very good because it also opens up a lot more possibilities. </p><p>For example, consider the case with NAT rules. Usually you want to open up a port so that traffic can go in. If you have an app running locally this becomes very easy, it can simply have a nat section where it lists all listening services and allows you to add nat rules on the router automatically. And this is just one example. Both the web gui nat rules and the applet would use exactly the same api so maintaining a separate api for external apps can be completely avoided. </p><p>I don&#039;t think rpc is going anywhere and rpcd is a very good project indeed. The web gui will continue to be self contained and run on the router. This is a hard fact. But of course to make development of plugins easier it would be possible to load up the gui locally and connect to the router over rpc. But this is mainly to make the life of development team much easier so that they don&#039;t need to upload package to the router every time they need to test something. And also, making sure that things work both ways is essential in order to do unit testing. </p><p>To understand what I meant, you can check out some of the new unit tests that I have added to the project here: </p><p><a href="https://github.com/mkschreder/iopsys-openwrt-inteno/blob/master/package/inteno/luciexpress/tests/test-uci.js">https://github.com/mkschreder/iopsys-op … est-uci.js</a> </p><p>This test runs locally using node js and connects to the router through rpc to test uci ubus module of rpcd. This test assisted me in finding a bug in rpcd that caused the rpcd service to end up in unusable state after doing a revert. So I&#039;m all for this kind of tests. It is now possible to run all currently available tests against the router over rpc using the command &quot;grunt test --host=&lt;routerip&gt; --user=&lt;rpc_login_username&gt; --pass=&lt;rpc_password&gt;&quot; from the luciexpress folder which contains Gruntfile.js. The tests will reveal if some dependencies are missing on the router or if some permissions are not being properly set.. </p><p>So I think there will be a lot more unit testing just to quickly be able to quality assure a build. It certainly simplifies things and saves time. But for it to be possible we must develop software so that it can both be run both entirely on the router and just as well off it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mkschreder</strong> on 16 May 2015, 14:04)</p>

I will be regularly rebasing it on the openwrt trunk to keep it up to date. This also means that it would be possible to directly merge it into main openwrt trunk when time comes for a more complete integration.</p>									</div>

					<p>Really want to use it. It&#039;s more user friendly than original openwrt web interface. Especially the mobile web interface. I think openwrt should make it as an official package.</p>									</div>

Most of my development is done on iopsys so obviously I make the best use I can of the utilities and ubus calls that are available under iopsys.</p><p>All the iopsys packages are open source and can be ported to your version of choice.</p><p>To build juci under openwrt use the juci feed that you can add to your collection of feeds:<br /><a href="https://github.com/mkschreder/juci-openwrt-feed.git">https://github.com/mkschreder/juci-openwrt-feed.git</a></p><p>To build completely standalone (including uhttpd etc.) use the juci standalone feed:<br /><a href="https://github.com/mkschreder/juci-feed.git">https://github.com/mkschreder/juci-feed.git</a></p><p>Juci main repo is located here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/mkschreder/luci-express.git">https://github.com/mkschreder/luci-express.git</a></p><p>Iopsys main public repo (all the backend packages you need for working system with juci) is located here:<br /><a href="http://ihgsp.inteno.se/git/iopsysAA.git">http://ihgsp.inteno.se/git/iopsysAA.git</a> (branch devel)</p><p>JUCI core is now pretty stable. I rarely do any significant changes to it now. Most of my work now is done on juci plugins themes and apps. For your own release you can easily create an app and use it with juci-core along with whatever other apps that will work for your platform (apps depend on ubus calls and uci configs that may be missing on your platform)</p><p>Official release notes for iopsys:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>inteno wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>As you are all aware we are working on the development of a new GUI implementation based on an Angular framework (Javascript) communicating using the JSON RPC. The JSON remote procedure call is access control protected and is the API toward UBUS. The new implementation called JUCI, provides for a more responsive user experience as most of the heavy load will be handled by the browser.&nbsp; The new implementation is now more suited for third party widget development and is more future proof.</p><p>Please note that a new and more robust file system was implemented on all releases with new GUI: UBIFS. The UBI file system improves the lifetime of the NAND flash hardware and improves the read/write access time.</p><p>We have now a first release with most of the end-user functionality available including: WLAN configuration, SSID, WPA, Channel selection 2,4G channels 1-13, Bandwidth (20,40 2,4G och 20, 40, 80 5G), Port forwarding, DHCP LAN, VoIP, and Dynamic DNS</p><p>On the 28th of July we are planning to release a version adding most of the network configuration functions, including multi-WAN etc. Target functions for this release is: Network configuration including IPv6, Bridging, multi-WAN, UPNP, Samba and MiniDLNA</p><p>On the 15th of August we plan to ad AP/Client mode and Advanced VoIP, as well as some more extensive testing.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>I have been putting great deal of effort recently into making juci generic. Juci now uses shell scripts in ubus backend and I am gradually eliminating the messy questd dependency and refactoring the backend so that it become more generic. </p><p>I hve also separated up juci functionality into multiple modules that can be installed separately. </p><p>Stay tuned :-)</p>									</div>

It used to be a C backend but I always felt it meant lots and lots of code duplication for the most trivial of things. So I tried writing the backend in a mix of bash and awk.. well that was very slow. So I tried perl and it became 50 times faster than bash.. and finally I have settled for lua again because lua is on par with perl in parsing text and is very very space efficient. </p><p>The difference in the use of lua in juci compared to luci is that we never ever generate any of the gui elements on the server. The scripting is only used for the backend and this works really well actually.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mkschreder</strong> on 14 Aug 2015, 19:41)</p>
