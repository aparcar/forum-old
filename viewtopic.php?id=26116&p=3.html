					<p>I was writing about some changes to AAP<br/>I worked on it and I completed all that changes<br/>This is to let everyone know about it</p><p>Anyway I sent all the new code to Orange<br/>It is important to know that the biggest and hardest-to-write part of AAP is written by Orange and I couldn&#039;t write it starting from 0<br/>I&#039;ve just added and changed some features<br/>So Orange now will decide what to do with my code: he can add some of my changes to the next Piranha release and he can refuse some changes<br/>Moreover, at the moment, I&#039;m in a mess cause I&#039;m going to move in a week to a new country (to Amsterdam) with a new job<br/>So probably I&#039;ll have not so much spare time in the next month</p><p>Here is a brief summary of my changes:</p><p>1) AAP WORKS ALSO WITH MULTIPLE VAP<br/>AAP works with &quot;a single madwifi-VAP ath0 in STA mode&quot; as Orange wrote here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21636">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=21636</a><br/>I.e. the fonera connects to a wifi net in client mode and uses its internet connection<br/>Fonera&#039;s clients has to connect to it via ethernet<br/>I want fonera to create a VAP (virtual access point) in AP mode, i.e. a new wifi net which uses the internet connection from the previous<br/>Now it is working even with multiple VAPs</p><p>2) RANDOM MAC ALSO WITHOUT ANY ETH CONNECTION<br/>Before connecting to a net in client mode, AAP changes randomly the MAC address of the fonera&#039;s wifi device<br/>But this change is not really random<br/>The command used to randomly change the MAC address is:<br/>macchanger -A wifi0<br/>Macchanger, to get a random number, uses the device /dev/random<br/>But in devices diskless, small and simple like the fonera, the entropy&#039;s source has not a high quality<br/>So it happens often (e.g. 2 times on 10) that the new MAC is an old one already used before<br/>This problem becomes more frustrating if the fonera is used without any ethernet connection (like me)<br/>Because the entropy&#039;s source for the device /dev/random is right the ethernet connection<br/>So, if there is no ethernet connection, 9 times on 10 the same &quot;random&quot; MAC is choosen<br/><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki//dev/random">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki//dev/random</a><br/><a href="http://www.pinkas.net/PAPERS/gpr06.pdf">http://www.pinkas.net/PAPERS/gpr06.pdf</a><br/>Now this problem is solved and the MAC is pseudo-random (every time it is different)</p><p>3) REWRITE FUNCTION aap_counter()<br/>The function counter() check the time since the last scan<br/>When the rescandelay (a parameter in the config file) interval is over, a new scan have to be done<br/>By default, rescandelay is 12 hours<br/>I rewrote this function minimizing the writes on disk</p><p>4) ANALYZE AND MINIMIZE WRITES ON DISK<br/>Minimized all the writes on disks, cause the router has a solid state memory and it can be ruined if written too often</p><p>5) BETTER SCAN<br/>The scan function use a command which updates the values of the signal power too slowly<br/>I.e. if a net become instantly less powerful (e.g. from a power of 80 to a power of 30), that command takes 5 min to updates this value (even if run more times)<br/>Now it is faster</p><p>6) CHANGES TO THE CHECK FUNCTION aap_check()<br/>I changed the way to check if the connection is ok or not<br/>Now the watchinet param has a bit different meaning<br/>The check can be done in 2 ways:<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; - using the ping command: if the param watchinet is 1<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; - checking that ath0 is associated: otherwise<br/>The first one tests if the network has a working internet connection (using the ping command and the parameter ineturl)<br/>The second one just tests if the ath0 is associated<br/>This second option is useful for me cause in my situation I have a lot of wifi networks available and all of them has always an internet connection<br/>So in this situation, if a ping fails, is just a temporary problem (caused by some delay) and I dont want to skip this network<br/>So it will check just the association status of ath0 using the command iwconfig</p><p>98) WEB GUI<br/>Get the web interface at: <a href="http://10.0.0.1/">http://10.0.0.1</a></p><p>99) SMALL BUGS AND CHANGES<br/>Fixed some bugs in the log</p>									</div>
