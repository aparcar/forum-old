					<p>Hello-</p><p>I am working on a port of mobilemesh[1], a mesh networking package, to OpenWRT.&nbsp; Currently I have patched the software to the point that it compiles against uclibc++.&nbsp; However when it is compiled it crashes almost immediatly.&nbsp; When it is compiled against stdlibc++ with my patches on a x86 box it works as expected however.&nbsp; So this implies that it is a platform specific issue and I was hoping I could call on you guys for some help and advice.</p><p>The svn repo for the code thus far can be found here: <a href="https://lug.oregonstate.edu/svn/mmwrt/package/mobilemesh/">https://lug.oregonstate.edu/svn/mmwrt/p … obilemesh/</a></p><p>If anyone has any suggestions or patches please post them here or email me brandon at ifup dot org.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also if people are interested on running it on there PCs I would suggest using the Debian packages, or using their patches[2] if you compile your own.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>[1] <a href="http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_transfer/mobilemesh/">http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_transfer/mobilemesh/</a><br />[2] <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mobilemesh/mobilemesh_1.0.orig.tar.gz">http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/ … rig.tar.gz</a> <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mobilemesh/mobilemesh_1.0-6.diff.gz">http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/ … -6.diff.gz</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Here is the FAQ[1] entry for getting up and running with mobilemesh.&nbsp; It would be a huge help if you could test with a two node network and report the results (or even a patch :-)).</p><p>I hang out in #openwrt nick is philips I can help you debug it there if I am around.</p><p>Thanks!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>2.2 Can you give me a quick primer on how to run the mmdiscover and
    mmrp tools?

Sure. But before you try to run the tools, you really should
understand the fundamentals of IP and be familiar with tools like
&quot;ifconfig&quot;, &quot;route&quot;, &quot;netstat&quot;, and &quot;tcpdump&quot;. For simplicity, let&#039;s
assume you have three laptops: A, B, and C. Let&#039;s also assume each
laptop has a single IP interface that happens to be a wireless LAN
card. ( Please don&#039;t assume that you must have a wireless LAN card in
order to use Mobile Mesh...you can run Mobile Mesh on any IP interface
regardless of media! ) Now let&#039;s assume that the name of the interface
on each laptop is &quot;eth0&quot;. We are doing alot of assuming here. Finally,
let&#039;s assume that we want to run Mobile Mesh because we have no fixed
infrastructure to leverage, like 802.11 access points.

If all we want to do is allow the three laptops to communicate,
possibly across a multihop path, and the laptops are not connected to
any media other than the wireless LAN, then we should begin by
removing any static routes that each laptop may have. In a shell
window, type &quot;netstat -rn&quot; to see the current list of IP routes. Make
sure there are none listed. If there are some listed, delete them
using the &quot;route&quot; command. You&#039;re on your own to delete the routes...I
warned you before that you should be familiar with these tools!

You should now start the link discovery tool on each laptop. In a
shell window, as root, type &quot;mmdiscover -i eth0 -z&quot;. The &quot;-z&quot; option
prevents the tool from becoming a daemon and running in the
background. I suggest using this mode at first, since any error
messages will be sent to the shell window rather than
/var/log/syslog. 

Now, you should make sure that the interfaces you want to run &quot;mmrp&quot;
on are listed in the mmrp config file.  You can change the parameters
that each protocol uses by editing their respective default config
files: /etc/mobilemesh/mmdiscover.conf and /etc/mobilemesh/mmrp.conf.
Make sure a line &quot;interface eth0&quot; is in the mmrp config file. You can
supply your own config file rather than using the default config
file...read the mmrp man page and look for the &quot;-f&quot; option.  You can
now start the router by typing, as root, in a shell window &quot;mmrp -z&quot;.

After a little time, you should see routes get added to the IP table;
use &quot;netstat&quot; to verify this. If you want more details about what the
tools are doing you can turn on debugging (see the next FAQ question.)</code></pre></div><p>[1] <a href="http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_transfer/mobilemesh/FAQ">http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_transfer/mobilemesh/FAQ</a></p>									</div>
