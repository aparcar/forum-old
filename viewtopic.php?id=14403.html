					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve been looking into why the watchdog on my DG834G(v2) has not been rebooting the unit after a kick timeout and I have a bug open at <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2378">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2378</a> . Seeing that this code has now gone into the mainline kernel, I was able to ask around on other channels as to what could be happening. I was told on #linuxmips that *some* AR7 devices have their watchdog disabled in hardware (via a resistor). I was also told that this status could be checked by looking at the BOOTCR register at 0xa8611a00. In the linux kernel, this corresponds to AR7_REGS_DCL and the clocks.c code actually makes use of this. </p><p>Ideally, one would want to modify&nbsp; ar7_wdt_init() to check the status of that register and bail out if it&#039;s disabled in hardware, but the actually bit encoding of this register is under NDA. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; One approach to reverse engineering this would be to carry a survey out of this value on openwrt users ar7 devices, and then look for some patterns. I have the following patch that will print this value:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Index: target/linux/ar7/files/arch/mips/ar7/clock.c

					<p>Ok, cool. Looks as if we may have identified the correct bit, but I still do not know which resistor you are referring to. That picture you link to has no indication on it and I don&#039;t know what you mean by &quot;Search resistor connected with pin17 flash memory.&quot; Perhaps, you could describe its location on that picture in the the form: bottom left, marked with &quot;R142&quot;? </p><p>Also, out of interest, what was nature of your testing? Did you short the resistor or did you solder it off the board?</p>									</div>
