					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I replaced my WNDR4500 with a Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H.&nbsp; The primary reason I did this was simply because the Buffalo one was fully compatible with OpenWRT.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Buffalo doesn&#039;t seem to be as powerful as the WNDR4500 which I wish was OpenWRT compatible.</p><p><strong>Therefore, I&#039;m wanting to purchase a new wireless router with best resources currently available and compatible with OpenWRT.</strong>&nbsp; <em>I wish the new OpenSource Linksys one was out, but will be a few months... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></em>&nbsp; I know this has been asked before, but all posts I found were older.&nbsp; Below is why I&#039;m wanting to do this as well as what minimal specs I&#039;d need:</p><p><strong>Why I Need Better Hardware</strong><br />1. I initially installed and played around with a few packages in OpenWRT.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they were too much for my router causing the load to go above 6.0 at one point.&nbsp; So, I had to restore it to defaults and installed packages I actually needed.</p><p>2. I use a Raspberry Pi&#039;s with OpenElec to stream video from my Windows server to my TVs.&nbsp; They are connected via LAN, but unfortunatly the RasbPi only has a 10/100 since its NIC runs on a USB bus.&nbsp; When streaming some 1080p videos, it would stutter or pause for about 3 seconds every 10-15 seconds.&nbsp; Since I still had my WNDR4500 configured, I did a clean swap to see if there was any difference.&nbsp; It streamed perfectly.&nbsp; I tried the Buffalo one again (after restart) and still had the issue.</p><p>3. My internet is 50mbps down and 10mbps up.&nbsp; When downloading things at full speed (from a system physically connected via LAN), the router&#039;s load hovers at about 1.2. </p><p><strong>Minimal Specs I Need</strong><br />- At least x4 Gig ports (10/100/1000)<br />- 2.4Ghz &amp; Pref 5Ghz Wireless<br />- Fully OpenWRT Compatible</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>BzowK</strong> on 12 Mar 2014, 19:26)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently have done the same research as you...I end up buying this one:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Model: TL-WDR4900 v1 (TP-Link)<br />Status: <strong>WIP</strong><br />CPU: Freescale P1014 - 800Mhz<br />Flash: 16<br />RAM: 128<br />Wifi:&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9381+AR9580 (11b/g/n+11a/n)<br />USB: 2x2.0</p></blockquote></div><p>I mainly use it for Torrents, File Sharing (SAMBA), Streaming HD (720/1080) content to my TV and Internet Surfing, i can say it does the job very well, the average usage of the CPU is 0.25, 0.27, 0.35, when everything is on use, by everyone at home, of coarse the more power you have, more you will be tempted to use <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />...</p><p><strong>CONS</strong>:</p><p>The wifi could have better coverage...its OK, not amazing! It has the power of setting 2.4Ghz to 30dBm (1000mW) and 5Ghz to 27dBm (501mW), never tested it that way, my country&#039;s regulations are enough for my needs, i also saw somewhere that setting all at max makes it overheat... </p><p>It&#039;s&nbsp; <strong>WIP</strong>, I&#039;m using the last OpenWRT Barrier Breaker trunk, it&#039;s fully functional, no bugs so far...all the new, more powerful equipments are at this moment <strong>WIP</strong>, in some months it will be fully officially supported, i hope <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I also checked other options like the ASUS RT-N66U (it was sold out!), but no OpenWRT, only Tomato FW (also very good FW), MerlinWRT (?) and DD-WRT (not bad FW, but...buggy), the specs blows away this one I have, this called &quot;<strong>Dark Night</strong>&quot; is a very powerful piece of equipment...</p><p>Other options i saw:TL-WDR7500/TP-Link Archer C7 (OpenWRT WIP) and Dlink DIR-868L (DD-WRT WIP?)</p><p>Any doubt check the:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a></p></blockquote></div><p>And of coarse Google! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>See ya...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>genjuro</strong> on 13 Mar 2014, 03:48)</p>

					<p>There&#039;s not really a huge performance difference between the two routers you already have - WNDR4500 has a MIPS 74k CPU core @ 600 MHz and the WZR-HP-AG300H is a MIPS 24k @ 680 MHz. The 74k core is slightly faster per clock in most circumstances, but not a huge difference. The fact that your having stuttering with your raspberry pi sounds like a different issue. As for the load question, either something is wrong or your asking it to do too much (you didn&#039;t specify which packages you had installed). </p><p>The Archer C7 has a MIPS 74k CPU running at 720MHz and is one of the faster CPUs in common consumer grade routers. Some of the newest AC routers have up to dual core ARM CPUs, but none of these are supported by OpenWrt yet. DD-WRT does have support for some (e.g. Netgear R7000).</p>									</div>
