					<p>Hi all. </p><p>I&#039;m running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1, and although everything works just fine, I&#039;ve noticed that the power led is blinking rapidly, about every 0.5 seconds. Tried to find documentation on what this indicated, but didn&#039;t quite find the infor I was looking for. <br />Does anyone here know what this fast blinking indicates? Is it failsafe mode or something? </p><p>Regards,<br />Kenneth</p>									</div>

					<p>What router is it? Has it <em>not</em> done this with OpenWrt or stock firmware in the past?

					<p>Ah, I sort of figured out what caused the blinking. In /etc/rc.local I had a command that intentionally never exited, but as soon as I added a &quot;&amp;&quot; (i.e. &quot;/usr/bin/sh myscript.sh &amp;&quot;) things works like a charm, and the power led stays lid.</p>									</div>
