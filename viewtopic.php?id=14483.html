Is their a fix if it does not If it does work is there instructions on how to set it up or does it work &quot;right out of the box&quot;</p><p>This is the last link in the chain of trying to make this thing work.

					<p>It should work out of the box. It should also work on Kamikaze. When the pc connects, does it get an ip address from the router? Also have you tried without wep just to see if it works?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wodin</strong> on 19 Feb 2008, 09:54)</p>
