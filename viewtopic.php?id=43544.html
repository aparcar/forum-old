					<p>After flashing the image, what did you do before running the uci commands in the link you mentioned?<br />Did you telnet in and set the password with &#039;passwd&#039;?<br />Did you then log out and ssh back in:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh root@192.168.1.1</code></pre></div><p>using the password you set?</p><p>Finally, I am not 100% certain, but luci should be available in that build, so you should be able to connect to 192.168.1.1 from your browser and set up the client via that.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m running into a similar problem. Reading around, it looks like iwconfig and iwlist have been deprecated in favor of iw. </p><p>Your solution will probably be to run &#039;iw dev wlan0(or your interface name) scan&quot;</p><p>If anyone can help me, I&#039;m trying to figure out how to find a command that will output the current txpower of an interface. I can do it with iwlist with &quot;iwlist &lt;interface&gt; txpower&quot;, but I can&#039;t seem to find a similar command with iw.</p>									</div>
