					<p>I want to connect 2 routers via wifi using openwrt.</p><p>I have a router A (192.168.1.1, arokhs build, R8000) which is connected to WAN, a PC.</p><p>I have a router B (192.168.1.2, lede, WDR4300) which has attached some other network devices.

					<p>When you &quot;join&quot; it considers the other router your ISP, puts it on the WAN network, so you are routing from it rather than bridged.&nbsp; This is because the regular AP-STA link is designed to have only one device as the STA.</p><p>If both routers were Atheros I would say to use AP-WDS mode instead, as then you could bridge your STA into the LAN on the 4300.&nbsp; I do not know if that works on an R8000 since it has Broadcom chips.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 21 Dec 2016, 05:29)</p>

					<p>Thanks, I finally managed to connect both routers using WDS mode as suggested. It only worked via 2.4Ghz (on WDR4300) and connected only to my alternative router TP-Link Archer C2600. It couldn&#039;t connect to R8000... So it is hardware limitations?</p><p>Now another issue how to make this wireless link tagged? I need it to pass VLAN 1 as untagged and VLAN 6 as tagged.</p><p>When I somehow manage to achieve this, how do I make VLAN 6 untagged on port 4? I&#039;m not sure how wifi communicates with LAN ports. Is it via CPU? So I would need to set VLAN 6 as tagged on CPU and untagged VLAN 6 on any port I want? When I do this via ethernet cable, it&#039;s pretty straightforward (LAN 1, VLAN 6, tagged and let&#039;s say LAN 4, VLAN 6, untagged).</p>									</div>
