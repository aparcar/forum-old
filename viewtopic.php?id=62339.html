					<p>I&#039;m a noob when it comes to setting up routing tables, and I ran into a bunch of headaches. I tried searching, but I don&#039;t know enough to know what to search for. Here&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to achieve. </p><p>What I&#039;ve got currently:<br />Our church currently uses 1 linksys router and 2 extenders that are wired back to the router. All of these are old 11b/g items. Everything is on one network, with the wifi &amp; lan bridged together. The office desktops &amp; printers are wired to the router; the pastor&#039;s laptop uses wifi to access his file shares; and the general public shares the same network. It&#039;s on WPA, but not secure at all.</p><p>They would like to replace them with something faster, and I had 4 WD MyNet N750 routers sitting around. Cheap, but they work.</p><p>Here&#039;s what they want:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Internal wired network has the printers &amp; server &amp; various office desktops on it.</p></li><li><p>One secure wireless network (It&#039;s SSID is ChurchInt, and is non-broadcasting &amp; WPA) which is bridged to the internal wired lan. This lets the laptops roam and still print &amp; access file shares.</p></li><li><p>One public wireless network (It&#039;s SSID will be ChurchPublic, broadcasts, WPA, client isolated). This is for guests, and use it only for internet access.</p></li></ul><p>What I&#039;ve done:<br /></p><ul><li><p>On the main router, I&#039;ve configured OpenWRT 15.05. I followed <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">this</a> and setup the wireless networks.</p></li><li><p>I&#039;ve got ChurchInt on both the 2.4 &amp; 5ghz radios, and ChurchPublic on 2.4.</p></li><li><p>ChurchInt &amp; lan are on 192.168.1.1/24</p></li><li><p>I made a new vlan and assigned 192.168.2.1/24 to ChurchPublic.</p></li><li><p>New vlan is forwarded to wan in firewall.</p></li></ul><p>Seems to work correctly as what they want by itself... But, they need more coverage. This is what the extenders were for. The old extenders can only broadcast one SSID, which won&#039;t work with both internal &amp; public wifi networks needing the broader coverage.</p><p>Is there a way I can set up one of the other new routers as a new repeater for both internal &amp; public wifi networks and keep them routing correctly? <br /></p><ul><li><p>There is cat5 running to them, and was going to use the wan port on the &quot;repeater routers&quot; and disable their firewalls.</p></li><li><p>I thought of just making the &quot;repeater&quot; boxes forward all traffic to the main router and let the main router figure out the routing, but I can&#039;t figure out how to get the repeaters to say &quot;this client is on the public network, get a 192.168.2.x address&quot; or &quot;this client is on the internal network, get a 192.168.1.x address&quot; from the DHCP server on the main router.</p></li><li><p>I looked into &quot;policy based routing&quot; but couldn&#039;t figure it out.</p></li><li><p>And, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s even possible to set up something that says &quot;this came from 192.168.1.x, forward to lan&quot; and &quot;this came from 192.168.2.x, forward it to wan&quot;</p></li></ul><p>How can I do this?</p>									</div>

					<p>The repeaters don&#039;t have to route anything, they can work as pure bridges. Create two bridges for ChurchInt and ChurchPublic. And add the vlan/untagged interface on the wired network, and the wireless network to each bridge. The repeaters don&#039;t even need an IP address on ChurchPublic, since they won&#039;t route any traffic, but you need one on the ChurchIn for management.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikma</strong> on 24 Jan 2016, 03:28)</p>

					<p>the only problem is some repeaters dont support multiple SSID repeating function just like what @op is trying to do. of course there&#039;s no way a VLAN to work over wireless either.</p><p>so the only solution is, connect all AP to wired connection and create a VLAN to do tagged traffic. Although this will require all AP to support VLAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi if i was setting this up i wood flash all the routers with Gargoyle. On the mane AP set up the 2.4 and 5ghz as you need then turn on the guest network and set up as required. then use router 2 and set it up as a repeater and set up as your public network. routers 3 and 4 set up as repeaters and set then to repeat the guest network from the mane AP. to set up a Gargoyle router as a repeater it&#039;s just a matter of a tic box and typing in the ip you wood like to repeat. Gargoyle is built on top of openwrt and it works grate on the wd routers i have 1 i use as a repeater. The routers that repeat the guest network will not be able to do file sharing so that&#039;s the one you should use as the public network. hope this helps.</p>									</div>
