					<p>After searching all over for what would seem to be a common issue, and failing to find the answer, I&#039;m going to post the answer I&#039;ve found here. It would seem that such a problem might deserve a FAQ entry or Stickyness.</p><p>------------------<br />I&#039;ve encountered this&nbsp; problem with several (all?) of the ipkged NoCatSplashes<br />for OpenWRT White Russian RC3:</p><p>On a WRT54GS v1.0, in every case, splashd -D<br />yields:</p><p>&#039;iptables: no target/chain/match by that name&#039;</p><p>upon loading. This is apparently caused by the fact that the &#039;ipt_REDIRECT&#039;<br />module is not loading.</p><p>To fix the issue, vim on into initialize.fw, and change line 32:</p><p>FROM:<br />for module in ipt_TOS ipt_mac; do</p><p>TO:<br />for module in ipt_REDIRECT ipt_TOS ipt_mac; do</p><p>And Voe Illa! NoCatSplash!</p><p>[I&#039;m using Schuyler Erle&#039;s ipkg, available at<br /><a href="http://nocat.net/~sderle/nocatsplash_0.93pre2-2_mipsel.ipk">http://nocat.net/~sderle/nocatsplash_0. … mipsel.ipk</a><br />&lt;<a href="http://nocat.net/%7Esderle/nocatsplash_0.93pre2-2_mipsel.ipk">http://nocat.net/%7Esderle/nocatsplash_ … mipsel.ipk</a>&gt;. I believe, however, this fix should handle any of the NoCatSplash+White Russian installs.]</p><p>Thanks for such a great tool, guys,</p><p>Chris</p><br /><p>PS Should someone see an error in my ways, please yell at me at your<br />earliest convenience. I&#039;ll be putting this live in a busy coffeshop.<br />[Actually, if anyone has any experience or comments on NoCatSplash<br />performance under heavy load, please let me know.]</p>									</div>

					<p>In fact, there seems to be interesting patches in the ewrt source. I have not yet repacked NoCatSplash, but it seems to be much more working.</p>									</div>

					<p>The fix JustThisGuy describes worked for me as well.&nbsp; Our hotspot only just opened, so can&#039;t speak to load issues for nocatsplash.</p><p>WRT54G v4 with RC3, using Schyler Earle&#039;s ipkg as above, with hacks as per oceanhippie.com to get nocatsplash to work.</p><p>I agree, the nocatsplash fix ought to be a sticky: damn useful tool, the nocatsplash, for community hotpot start-ups.</p>									</div>
