					<p>Yes, i figured it out. I was just browsing the url from first post and found the ipk i need it. </p><p>But got another problem. When i install luci-app-adblock, the internet is not accessible. Connection to router is working but no internet connection, maybe something with firewall problem.</p><p>And another one. On stock firmware, wifi is full speed (all 40mbps from modem). But on your build it is just half of 54mbps, even on 5ghz and 40 mhz channel width. </p><br /><p>Any tips or solutions?

					<p>@arokh</p><p>I just flashed your latest build 49005 onto my WNDR3700V1 and it&#039;s ZINGING. GREAT JOB, great improvements from the older version I was running... I first flashed your build onto my router about a year and a half ago and had that going solid the whole time... </p><p>If anyone is wondering - the WNDR3700V1 can handle the image but you can&#039;t try to add too much to it, no extra packages or nano editor etc... You fill up your root really quickly. I&#039;m running my root from a USB plugged in the back so now I have all the room I would ever need for a router OS.</p><p>I enabled jumbo frames on the switch settings and I&#039;m getting massive throughput increases on file transfers from my media server. Absolutely tearing the max of 1Gbps... The wifi is really strong and stable, no issues. Streaming 8-10G movies wirelessly to TV&#039;s etc... </p><p>I&#039;m only sad for 1 reason. I can&#039;t put this on my other routers! I have a WNDR4000 and WNDR3400... Well I suppose I can if I &#039;build&#039; it as per your instructions... But would those routers handle it? The WNDR4000 is VERY similar to the 3700 so I would think so... WNDR3400 not so much. </p><p>Thank you again for all the hard work and continued building. Your build is absolutely amazing.</p><p>PPS&gt; I&#039;m using your built in ad-blocking and it&#039;s doing wonders. Back in the day on the older builds it was a little slower/buggy but now it&#039;s great.</p>									</div>

					<p>@luisd<br />Thanks for the info. In my small home residence network I don&#039;t see a big need for https and certificates. If I have a man-in-the middle I probably have bigger issues. Good to know that you can get a certificate free just in case. </p><p>--bill</p>									</div>
