					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am new to the forum and to OpenWrt.<br />I have just bought a TP-LINK TL-WR700N, which is a great device, but firmware is in Chinese.<br />Do any one here have it, too?<br />Is there any plan to port OpenWrt to support it?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Zachi.</p>									</div>

					<p>Though currently Ralink WiSoC is not officially supported by OpenWrt, I think in the future the RT3050F solution should be very promising for compact aps. ASUS release WL-330N3G which might be the smallest ap at the moment. Yeah AR9331 is also perfect for compact aps but it looks like the manufactuers care more about cost than features.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27701">OpenWrt / Travel wifi router</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=134188#p134188">OpenWrt / Traveling with all your wifi gadgets and connecting them all to one w</a></p>									</div>

					<p>The 330N3G looks interesting. It doesn&#039;t have a built-in PSU but the external adapter looks like just a USB charger with a microUSB plug...? In that case, I assume one can power it with those little iDoh chargers and that would be a nice little package...?</p><p>It has enough RAM and flash to run *Wrt?</p><p>Cheers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>loyukfai</strong> on 27 Jun 2011, 06:43)</p>

					<p>Hi guys,<br />I know this topic is 5 years old but I have a question on the 700N - hopefully someone is still reading.<br />I did the flash and eprom upgrade on a 703N from this post:<br />h t t p s://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=295870#p295870</p><p>So I took what I did there and first upgraded the RAM on a 700N to 512Mbit (64Meg), and the unit still booted and ran.&nbsp; Knowing the processor is a Atheros AR9331, I used the same .bin file (as described in that post), I created for the 703N, programmed a blank flash and soldered it in.&nbsp; The unit boots, but its not stable. Clicking on any of the menu tabs causes (90% of the time) the unit to reboot. <br />Since the 703N project had me use: openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin<br />I looked for a 700N version and there is none because the stock device wont support openwrt - I get it).<br />I don&#039;t know enough about the firmware to know the differences device to device. <br />So,,, is there a generic-tl-wr70xn-v1-squashfs-factory.bin&nbsp; or a bin from another device that could be used on the 700N if one where to upgrade the RAM and flash as I did - and follow the recreation steps of the 703N post ?</p>									</div>
