					<p>Hi,</p><p>my ISP assigns a RFC1918 IP adress to the WAN interface of my router. Outbound connections to the internet are NATed anywhere in the ISPs infrastructure to a public routable address.<br />How can I setup inbound connections from the internet to the home office LAN? Never had an internet connection without a public routable IP...</p><p>What about the following ideas?<br />1. OpenWrt as L2TP/IPSec client; VPN to a firewall with an fixed public IP range; use one of this public IPs to forward connections through the tunnel to the home office LAN<br />2. Use a public available VPN peer?<br />3. Tunneling software?<br />4. ...</p><p>I&#039;m not expecting a complete HOWTO nor a detailed config - just an idea how to handle this. I&#039;m happy for any hint, folks!</p><p>Thx &amp; cheers,<br />Markus</p>									</div>
