					<p>[Short Background:&nbsp; I ordered (3) Motorola WR650G routers refurbished, but they must have run out because they sent me (2) WR650G and a Motorola WPS870G print server to make up for it?&nbsp; What the?&nbsp; Anyway before I complain, I&#039;d like to see if this thing could run OpenWRT.&nbsp; It has USB, which interests me for USB Audio hacks.]</p><p>Outside:<br/>(1) Ethernet, (1) Printer Port, (1) USB, (1) small non-replacable antenna</p><p>I could find very little about the innards on the net so I opened it up:</p><p>Brecis Communcations MSP2007-CA-A2 AHG52K 0804B Taiwan<br/>NEC D720101F1 0438PUA46<br/>DAVICOM DM916<br/>AMDSLV1600B (there is INK over it, I can&#039;t read it very good, probably wrong)<br/>PCCARD: FCCID: M4Y-XG-600</p><p>No telnet is open<br/>nmap output:<br/>PORT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STATE SERVICE<br/>21/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;open&nbsp; ftp<br/>79/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;open&nbsp; finger<br/>80/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;open&nbsp; http<br/>139/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; netbios-ssn<br/>515/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; printer<br/>631/tcp&nbsp; open&nbsp; ipp<br/>9100/tcp open&nbsp; jetdirect</p><p>I don&#039;t see anything obvious for JTAG.&nbsp; There is TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4, TP5 in a row.&nbsp; Could be Test Pad?</p><p>The MSP2007 is apparently a MIPS32...&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I lack the knowledge to do any &quot;real&quot; hacking.&nbsp; Whats up with the file jtag-brecis-ok.zip ?&nbsp; I see references to it around.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Scott</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah well...&nbsp; it sounds like just the ticket for a Internet Audio Player through the USB, but I guess it&#039;s too weird.</p><p>hehe... anyone need a wireless print server.&nbsp; Or better yet...&nbsp; start a &quot;bounty&quot; on hacking this thing.&nbsp; I&#039;d start a bounty with $20 to get OpenWRT running on it.&nbsp; Maybe there are better targets though...</p>									</div>
