					<p>I was upgrading my WDR3600 with sysupgrade when my ssh connection closed. I waited a few minutes before restarting the router, but when I turned it back on all the LEDs flash and I don&#039;t see it sending anything on the network with tcpdump. I soldered headers to the serial port (following this debricking guide: <a href="http://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=934517#934517)">http://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=934517#934517)</a> and connected it to my raspberry pi&#039;s serial port but I just get garbage (eg. &quot;ëëïûÿOK{&quot;). I&#039;m using this command line for minicom: &quot;minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyAMA0&quot;, and only have ground, TX, and RX on the router connected to ground, RX, and TX on the raspberry pi (I also tried connecting TX-&gt;TX and RX-&gt;RX). I checked the pins with my multimeter and ground has 0v, power has 3.3v, RX has 0v, and TX has a constant ~2.3v. Also, my solder joints are pretty clean. What could the problem be?</p>									</div>

					<p>The ground pin wasn&#039;t soldered well, I resoldered it and it&#039;s working at 115200 baud, but most of the characters are corrupted.

					<p>I realise this is an old posting but can&#039;t see an answer and I have a a very similar problem that might help.<br />My WDR3600 is effectively bricked. I&#039;ve connected a USB UART to the serial port on board. All the internet sites say the port is a standard serial 8 bit, 1 stop bit, no parity, no h/w control. The weird thing is that with that config I receive scrambled text but can transmit commands un-corrupted. If I want to see what is going on and receive good data I have to set the com port to 7bit, 1 stop bit, no parity and no h/w control. <br />So for instance I can set a memory test going, reload putty in the 7bit mode and see the memory test perform perfectly.<br />I have no idea what is going on. I can&#039;t flash new data like this because I keep having to reload putty with the different config just to see the effect of the command.<br />Has anyone else seen this or know what is going on?</p>									</div>
