					<p>Hey guys and gals I am having an issue with my Antminer S1 that I can&#039;t seem to figure out. I went to factory reset the unit using the webUI and it all went down hill from there. The reset seemed to be taking a while so I left it to do it&#039;s thing overnight. In the morning, it appeared to be at the same step it was on the night before, which basically said the unit will reset when changes were applied. Something went wrong during the process, the IP address did not default back to 192.168.1.99 and when I try connecting to it using the IP address I configured previously (192.168.1.243) I get the black screen with LuCI - Lua Configuration Interface in the upper left but then the connection times out. I have tried using the factory reset button to reset everything but it sadly doesn&#039;t <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.</p><p> After doing some research I found out about the failsafe mode which I am having some trouble with. While the machine is booting up I press the reset button multiple times until I see the LED below the ethernet port flash rapidly (I assume this is failsafe). I am unable to telnet into it and I have tried ssh as well to no avail.&nbsp; The miner is running the most current firmware from bitmaintech (antMiner_openwrt20140207).&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to read this and any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
