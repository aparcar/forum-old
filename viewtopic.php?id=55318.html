					<p>All,</p><p>kind of stuck and would appreciate some hints. I&#039;m trying to recompile python-pcap 1.1 (from oldpackages) to fix an exception issue. I&#039;ve setup the buildroot as well as downloaded / installed the oldpackages feed. Trying to follow the instructions for compiling individual packages (altered for the different oldpackages path) results in errors (no rules to make target). I assume I need t o modify the Makefile in some manner?</p><p>I would gladly take any help and / or hints for how to proceed.</p><p>/aj</p>									</div>
