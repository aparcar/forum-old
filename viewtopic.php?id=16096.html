					<p>Thanks for the reply! I&#039;ll give it a shot as soon as i get home... now I&#039;m at work and there&#039;s no way to test if it&#039;s working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />. Anyway, I think the first option is better because the lan at work has more than one ip class. So the iptables should look like this:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;iptables -I FORWARD -i br-lan -o tun0 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; ?</p>									</div>
