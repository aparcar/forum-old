					<p>Hi all, </p><p>I have installed wrt on a tplink TL MR-3020 which works great. </p><p>However: I have connected the internal serialport to my vacuum cleaner robot&#039;s serial interface (with a level converter inbetween).</p><p>Now, both myself and init wants the internal serial port, /dev/ttyATH0. When I kill -9 the process, I am able to communicate with the vacumm cleaner using minicom - until init respawns the process, which is happening as soon as the vacuum cleaner starts to send data.</p><br /><p>What is the easiest way of avoiding init to respawn? Being the newbie to wrt that I am, I tried to edit inittab to remove the serial login, but I could not save, which makes sense.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vespaman</strong> on 26 Apr 2013, 20:42)</p>
