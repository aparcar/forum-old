Are there existing templates or tutorials in regards to implementing such a thing?</p><p>Also, I&#039;d like to know if they&#039;re capable of analogue input as well?

					<p>GPIO programming depends on the SoC. Usually you have a direction (input, output) and a data register for a set of GPIO.<br />Look into the datasheet of the SoC or in the Linux kernel sources if your hardware is supported.</p><p>AFAIK GPIO never support analogue input. Some SoC contain ADC. If yours doesn&#039;t, a separate ADC with SPI, i2C or 1-wire<br />interface should be used.</p>									</div>
