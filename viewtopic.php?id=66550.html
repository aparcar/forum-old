					<p>For any real help you need to be much more specific.</p><p>Please include your goals (internet vs local access, client to server, server to client, etc), your network, firewall, VPN configs for both sides, and VPN log files.&nbsp; Less important, but probably worth noting is the hardware.</p><p>I consider this a better reference currently <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openvpn-streamlined-server-setup">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/open … rver-setup</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry,<br />The goal is for the clients on the clientside to access the server(win2012 ip:192.168.1.20) on the serverside. </p><p>I&#039;m an ok network technician but right now I&#039;m about to breakdown... <br />I have setup a few openvpn but only &quot;road-warrior&quot; types and I did think it would be that much more to route a few more clients over the same connection, figured it would be to add a forward route and it would be done... but no :-( </p><p>Thanks for the link to the other discussion.

					<p>RangerZ and Joa,</p><p>I am in the same boat as you were Joa and seems that you were able to overcome this with the iptables commands above. I however am still having difficulties after trying those commands on my server and client using my LAN ip’s. </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Server<br />iptables -I FORWARD -s 192.168.210.0/24 -d 192.168.200.0/24 -j ACCEPT <br />Client<br />iptables -I FORWARD -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d 192.168.210.0/24 -j ACCEPT</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Here is my configuration</strong><br />for my LAN I have a primary site that runs OpenWRT/openVPN GW/FW with an Openvpn server LAN side ip 192.168.210.0/24<br />I have a secondary site that runs OpenWRT/openVPN GW/FW with a Openvpn client LAN side ip 192.168.200.0/24<br />VPN network ip is 10.8.0.0<br />Server Tun0 is 10.8.0.1<br />Client Tun0 is 10.8.0.6</p><p><strong>Server Problems:</strong><br />What I am seeing is the following from the OpenWRT router using ssh I can ping 10.8.0.1 &amp; 10.8.0.6 but not the subnet of 192.168.200.0/24. With my laptop connected to the openwork router I am unable to ping beyond the 10.8.0.1 section of the tunnel.</p><p><strong>Client problems:</strong><br />The OpenWRT Client router using SSH can ping both 10.8.0.1 &amp; 10.8.0.6 and the entire 192.168.210.0/24 network. The problem is that a laptop plugged into the OpenWRT client router is able to ping 10.8.0.1 &amp; 10.8.0.6 but unable to ping the network beyond that :192.168.210.0/24.</p><p>My objective is to be able to ping from LAN network on any computer through the tunnel to any computer on the second location LAN network.</p><p>I have read many openwrt write ups and posts relating to this exact same problem.</p><p>I however want to throw a curve ball into this equation we are using Openwrt on a Xen server this may be causing issue but to my knowledge shouldn’t be.</p><p>I am willing to work with anyone and even at this point willing to outsource for this solution.</p><p>Thanks<br />Robert</p>									</div>
