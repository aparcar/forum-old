					<p>G&#039;day everyone. I recently picked up a TP Link TD-W8970 ADSL2+/VDSL2 modem/router!</p><p>According to the OpenWRT ToH <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8970">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8970</a> the device is seemingly supported!</p><p>I&#039;ve built it from from source and attempted to flash using the Web UI, only to be thrown &quot;Error code 4503: the uploaded file was not accepted by the device&quot;</p><p>A cursory google suggested trying to rename the file to a TP-Link file to no avail</p><p>Beyond that, a quick hexedit compare between the two shows they do seem to be virtually identical to begin with, which makes me doubt that there&#039;s any sort of &quot;magic key&quot; at the start of the firmware</p><p>Anyone else had any issues like this that could point me in the right direction?</p>									</div>
