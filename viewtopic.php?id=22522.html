					<p>I have been happily using a set of Belkin USB-serial converters for many years.&nbsp; Because they&#039;re getting old and failing, and are also fairly bulky, I&#039;m trying to move to newer devices.</p><p>I have some based on pl2303, ch341, etc.</p><p>What I&#039;m finding, however, is that apparently they are coming out of the box with different sets of default CTS/RTS and other serial parameters, and they don&#039;t work with my serial interfaces downstream.</p><p>I haven&#039;t been able to Google my way to a solution: how do you manipulate the various serial parameters for a USB serial device.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see anything I change with stty do anything, and I haven&#039;t had any luck with setserial either.</p><p>If anyone has some hands-on with this matter, I&#039;d sure be obliged for some pointers.</p>									</div>
