					<p>Work-In-Progress Day (WIP-Day)</p><p>New things are happening these days – Kamikaze is officially released, <br />new hardware platforms are being added and there will soon come a move <br />to the 2.6.22 kernel.</p><p>It can be overwhelming to keep track of all these new developments, and <br />difficult for individuals who wants to participate active to find out <br />where to begin?<br />I recently started a thread on the openwrt-devel mailing-list about how to <br />do something about some of these problems. As a result of various input<br />and respons to my idea I would like to suggest a new initiative with the title:</p><p>Work-In-Progress Day (WIP-Day)</p><p>It is the intention to organize a monthly working day (24 hours) similar <br />to the Gentoo projects bugday:</p><p><a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/bugday/index.xml">www.gentoo.org/proj/en/bugday/index.xml</a></p><p>The Gentoo bugday is a monthly &quot;day&quot; (24 hours during a weekend) <br />focussed on fixing &quot;bugs&quot; in both distribution and packages.<br />In practice it takes place on IRC, and the aim is to make it possible <br />for everyone to participate in fixing a &quot;bug&quot; (independent of skills and <br />experience). There is an official list of &quot;bugs&quot; which is posted before <br />the day starts, and various developers/committers help people who take <br />part with learning how to do this (this was the very short version of <br />what goes on). As it is stated on the Gentoo website:</p><br /><p>“... every first saturday of a month, a bugday is hosted on <br />#gentoo-bugs, on irc.freenode.net. During the whole day, users pick bugs <br />from the list presented on bugday.gentoo.org and, with the possible help <br />of attending devs, try and fix them....”</p><br /><p>It is the aim of the Gentoo bugday to function as a way of helping <br />people to participate in the activities of the project and at the same <br />time to be a social forum.</p><p>I would like to suggest that something similar was introduced as part of <br />the activities of OpenWrt? Though, I have to admit that I believe the <br />concept itself would have to be changed somewhat.</p><p>There are many different things which can be worked on: Hardware <br />platforms, porting of packages, documentation, localization and so <br />forth. I would like to suggest that a needs/offers model is followed <br />instead.<br />One person, or group could offer to work on porting on packages – <br />teaching/helping others to do this – while similar others could could <br />state a need for working on a specific platform (or device).</p><p>This initiative could start-out with using the forum for posting of <br />offers/needs and host the “day” itself on #openwrt-devel, combined with <br />posting &#039;what are we doing&#039; emails on openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org – <br />these emails could then be merged together into a monthly newsletter.</p><p>When to begin with this new activity? <br />I would like to suggest that a first WIP-Day could take place either after the <br />official move to the 2.6.22 kernel or (just to pick a date) saturday the 30. of June <br />from UTC 12.00 and 24 hours ahead.</p><p>How to begin?<br />People/members who are interested can begin with adding a list of &#039;offers and needs&#039; <br />to this forum-thread, and take part in deciding when such a first WIP-Day should <br />take place - and basicly just discuss the idea :-)</p><br /><p>glp</p>									</div>
