					<p>Hey! I have an old Sagemcom Fast 3764 DSL modem that I would like to turn into an LTE modem (if possible), or at least install OpenWrt on to play with <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I am sort of confused as to whether it is supported or not.</p><p>NMAP claims this is this, (but that&#039;s probably wrong). Definitely not an Intel chip though.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Actiontec MI424WR router telnetd</code></pre></div><p>I can telnet into it, and have a shell, so let me know if there&#039;s any way I can get proper information about whether it&#039;s supported or not.

As far as I can tell, according to the number printed on the chip, it&#039;s an Ikanos Fusiv Vx180. The closest I have found on the OpenWrt site is the Sagem LiveBox 2, although that uses an older, slower chip.</p><p>So, how can I tell if it&#039;s supported, and are there any installation instructions out there?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>PS: sorry, I wanted to link to the chip and the wiki page, but it won&#039;t let me - guess I am too new.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>patthebrat</strong> on 26 Aug 2016, 15:37)</p>
