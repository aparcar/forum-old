					<p>Hi All!</p><p>First time playing with OpenWRT!&nbsp; I want to thank everyone who&#039;s made this terrific product so wonderful!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been learning a lot from using it!&nbsp; So far, I&#039;ve been able to use a 2GB Flash Drive (one of those Corsair ones) as my root drive on my Asus WL-500gP loaded up with Kamikaze 7.09.</p><p>I finally want to get Asterisk off my aging Linux box and move it over to my Asus WL-500gP running 7.09.&nbsp; I was wondering what&#039;s currently the best way to go in doing so?&nbsp; I saw zandbelt&#039;s contribution for 7.06 and Asterisk 1.4.9, but saw that it is now obsolete since Asterisk has been merged into the official OpenWRT repositories.&nbsp; I looked around the repositories and did an &#039;ipkg update&#039; but don&#039;t see any Asterisk packages for 7.09.</p><p>So my question now is what is the best way for me to go about getting a nice new version of Asterisk installed onto 7.09?&nbsp; Any helps, comments, suggestions welcomed!&nbsp; And thanks in advance!</p><p>Cheers,<br />Kermee</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All!</p><p>Thought I would update my own thread as I finally figured it out!</p><p>I got Asterisk 1.4.11 installed and working great!&nbsp; This was a huge upgrade for me from Asterisk 1.2.13 which I&#039;ve been running on a Fedora Core 4 Linux box for a couple of years now.&nbsp; The quick and dirty is the following:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>1. Install Kamikaze 7.09.</p><p>2. With much thanks to Bob Keyes in compiling all the 7.09 packages (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=57145">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=57145</a>) and hosting the packages for mipsel&#039;s at the following repository: <a href="http://sigil.eecs.harvard.edu/OpenWRT/Kamikaze-7.09/wgt634u/packages/">http://sigil.eecs.harvard.edu/OpenWRT/K … /packages/</a></p><p>3. Add the above repository and ipkg install asterisk14 and whichever other modules you need (i.e. asterisk14-sounds, asterisk14-voicemail).</p><p>4. ipkg install by URL, <a href="http://nslu2-linux.dyoung-mirror.net/feeds/unslung/wl500g/asterisk14-gui_0.0.0svn-r195-1_mipsel.ipk">http://nslu2-linux.dyoung-mirror.net/fe … mipsel.ipk</a> ... This adds all the GUI stuff. (You may have to force-override the dependencies.&nbsp; It&#039;s okay!)</p><p>5. For some odd-reason, the asterisk14 1.4.11 package from step 3 is missing codec_gsm.so.&nbsp; Grab the following ipkg, <a href="http://members.home.nl/hans.zandbelt/openwrt/kamikaze/packages/asterisk-1.4/asterisk14_1.4.9-1_mipsel.ipk">http://members.home.nl/hans.zandbelt/op … mipsel.ipk</a>, and do a tar zxvf on the file and tar zxvf on the resulting data.tar.gz.&nbsp; Inside, grab the ./usr/lib/asterisk/modules/codec_gsm.so and copy it over to your installation.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget to chmod 700 the codec_gsm.so!</p><p>6. Edit /etc/asterisk/httpd.conf and set &quot;enabled=yes&quot;, &quot;enabledstatic=yes&quot;, change &quot;bindaddr=0.0.0.0&quot; and uncomment &quot;prefix=asterisk&quot;.</p><p>7. Edit /etc/asterisk/manager.conf and make sure it&#039;s &quot;enabled=yes&quot;, &quot;webenabled=yes&quot;, &quot;port=5038&quot; and &quot;bindaddr=0.0.0.0&quot;.&nbsp; *THEN* add a section titled &quot;[administrator]&quot; or something similar, (The section &quot;[mark]&quot; is the sample one.).&nbsp; Then make sure you create a &quot;secret = yourpasshere&quot; under the [administrator] section.&nbsp; Uncomment the last two lines of the file which starts with &quot;read =&quot; and &quot;write =&quot;.</p><p>8. /etc/init.d/asterisk start</p><p>9. Pray.</p><p>10. <a href="http://192.168.x.x:8088/asterisk/static/config/setup/install.html">http://192.168.x.x:8088/asterisk/static … stall.html</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Good luck!</p><p>Cheers,<br />Kermee</p><p>P.S. I see a 1.4.12 package has been compiled for mipsel, but I haven&#039;t had a chance to play with it yet.</p>									</div>
