					<p>hi,<br />the V3b is a hauwei unit based on bcm6361.</p><p>we&#039;ve got a root prompt on the V3B, but it&#039;s rumored that any change to the rootfs (read only jffs2) renders the unit non boot.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not tried myself as there&#039;s no serial or jtag on the unit.</p><p>Has anyone any info on &#039;modern&#039; CFEs, and if they do check the rootfs in some way, and if this can be disabled, or if the CFE can be replaced?&nbsp; Looks like access to the CFE flash area would be only via a specific broadcom driver - i.e. it&#039;s not part of the exposed mtd regions.</p>									</div>
