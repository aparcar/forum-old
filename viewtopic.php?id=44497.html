					<p>Hi,</p><p>I live in Japan and just got myself a WZR HP G450H. I&#039;m trying to install OpenWrt on it but nothing seems to work. I can&#039;t even get the stock Buffalo US (english) firmware to install.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried following the TFTP instructions I found on various forums like:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=175207#p175207">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 07#p175207</a><br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=737509&amp;sid=bbf9dafa3173a4d1f7cd3f7626497f25">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. … 7626497f25</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g450h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g450h</a></p><p>I have two issues:</p><p>1- Since the router is unplugged when I start the process, my TFTP client won&#039;t &#039;put&#039; anything and complains there is no route (which makes sense since the router isn&#039;t even plugged in)</p><p>2- While the router is starting up, in my TFTP client, I keep trying to &#039;put&#039; the file and eventually TFTP stops complaining about a missing route. But nothing seems to happen and after a 60 second timeout my TFTP client timeouts. I&#039;m guessing that it&#039;s missing the upload window.</p><p>Would someone be able to either post detailed instructions on how to flash OpenWrt onto the G450H or point me to some online instructions?</p><p>Thanks a million in advance!</p><p>Jean</p>									</div>

					<p>Those TFTP instructions appear to be created for upgrading from dd-wrt. I had the impression that for Buffalo routers, you can simply flash the &quot;-factory&quot; image over the stock Buffalo firmware. At least that&#039;s what I did for my own Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH.</p>									</div>

There is something about the Japanese version that makes it impossible to use that route. I believe the japanese firmware checks any new version for a digital signature.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I don&#039;t know if you found an answer, but I got a lot of help from reading this: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30810">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=30810</a>.</p><p>Basically to do tftp, you need to have a switch.&nbsp; I have another router with dd-wrt that I configured as a switch using this <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Switch">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Switch</a>.</p><p>That is a biggie there.&nbsp; Without the switch your computer will have to make sure it has an ethernet link first and by that time the tftp server on the router would have been turned off.</p><p>Also, make sure you set your arp links and after you successfully tftp, make sure you delete those arp links with <strong>sudo arp -da</strong> (I was banging my head wondering why I couldn&#039;t get to the log in of the router nor ping it, and it&#039;s because I left this little step out.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>sm0ke</p>									</div>

Unfortunately none of the seem to have been used by the router. It always boots up with the stock UI. I&#039;ve tried the Buffalo US pro and friendly firmware. I&#039;ve also decrypted the pro version and tried that and also Openwrt and dd-wrt.

					<p>Have you tried to use the 19484 Beta (Buffalo Branded) DD-WRT?&nbsp; I actually couldn&#039;t get my router flash correctly until I used that one.&nbsp; I read somewhere you had to strip some headers and what not if you are trying to use another type of file.&nbsp; The 19484 has the .enc extension right &quot;out of the box&quot;.</p><p>From then I was able to install OpenWRT.&nbsp; Hopefully that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>I own the WZR-450HP and had some &quot;success&quot; with OpenWrt.<br />I say success because my firmware seems to become corrupted and I loose WAN and LAN connectivity, but still have WiFi. <br />Anyway I&#039;m not sure how different our 2 routers are (if at all) but I followed this guide </p><p><a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1331611/guide-recovering-a-bricked-buffalo-airstation-n450-router-wzr-hp-g450h">http://www.overclock.net/t/1331611/guid … r-hp-g450h</a></p><p>I didn&#039;t have a bricked router, I wanted to change from the stock Japanese firmware. The firmware appears to have installed properly and I can flash the firmware with the GUI. I&#039;m not too knowledgeable with flashing routers or configuring networks so possibly it&#039;s an error on my part.</p><p>You will probably have to buy a USB to TTL device.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t sold at Big Camera, Yamada Denki, Edion, etc.<br />I bought this <a href="http://www.aitendo.com/product/5409">http://www.aitendo.com/product/5409</a><br />Hopefully I provided some help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AnarchyEqualsLiberty</strong> on 15 Jun 2013, 06:53)</p>
