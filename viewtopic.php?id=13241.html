					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m lacking electrical expertise, so I it may be very simple one.</p><p>The question is does anyone know is it possible to power the new La Fonera+ (FON2201) with 5V/2A or 7,5V/1,5A without burning anything and which combination is better?</p><p>The background is:<br />I have WRT54GL powered by a POE splitter. The splitter has two modes of operation 12V/1A (suitable for WRT54GL) and 5V/2A (that was suitable for previous La Fonera). The new La Fonera+ uses different input power of 7,5V/1A. The only product (POE-100S) I&#039;ve found on my market that can deliver 7,5V over TP cable but the current is 1,5A. The downside of this splitter that it&#039;s not 802.3af compilant. On the other hand, the previous La Fonera router had the internals rated at 7,5V but was working with voltage of 5V. And that makes me think the new La Fonera can be powered by 5V/2A. Can someone clarify this issue for me? Will I burn the unit if I plug 5V/2A and/or 7,5V/1,5A into it?</p><p>Kind Regards,<br />Andrey Nepomnyaschih</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nas</strong> on 2 Nov 2007, 09:34)</p>

					<p>Find out the maximum rated voltage of the voltage regulator circuits used. If 12v is well under the maximum, it should be OK.<br />Also measure the actual voltage of the power supply. It might be an unregulated power supply in which case the voltage regulators would have to take more voltage.</p>									</div>

					<p>The newer model Foneras have switching power supplies. They *may* work at 5V, but they become less efficient with the lower input voltage. You would need to check the IC datasheet to see if it will operate correctly at the reduced input voltage.</p>									</div>

					<p>Or you could just try it.</p><p>I&#039;ve modified a La Fonera (FON2200, so essentially identical to the + except for the extra ethernet) successfully to use non-standard PoE, with an injector homemade from an RJ45 coupler that just sits on the end of the regular powersupply wire. I can make more for, let&#039;s say 20 euros plus shipping from NL. Your choice of firmwares for an extra 5. For that you&#039;d get the entire new-Fonera package, modified in this way. That doesn&#039;t do much more than cover the cost of the couple of extra parts I need plus the Fonera itself, so it&#039;s not like I&#039;d be getting rich. The plus, however, is currently on sale in NL at 45 euros more than the regular fon, so that one&#039;d be rather more expensive.</p>									</div>
