					<p>I successfully installed OpenWrt on my Cisco MR18. The following issue appeared with the initial firmware available for that model as well as with the latest one (including fully up-to-date packages).</p><p>Issue is that the router after some time due to whatever reason automatically changes its 5 GHz DFS wifi channels to a none DFS channel although I have configured them being fixed. I did several scans and there is definetly no interference with other routers using any channels (neither non nor real DFS channels) of the 5 GHz band.</p><p>Has anybody an idea why that is (e.g. is this a HW &quot;feature&quot; or OpenWrt &quot;feature&quot;) and how I can prevent that behavior?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply, but </p><p>(i) why does my FritzBox router never change its DFS channel (I bet AVM follow the rules)?<br />(ii) why isn&#039;t the OpenWrt router switching back to the originally configured channel as soon as it is free again in such cases?</p><p>Do you have any idea how to debug the bahvior?

					<p>It&#039;s just a workaround, I didn&#039;t suggest to add this to openwrt or anything, or that this is a fix.&nbsp; But luup can try if it helps in his case, until the implementation of DFS/radardetection for/in the ath(9k) driver gets better, especially in dealing with false-positives.</p><p>My device detects every 2-5 days a radarsignal (?) and switches to a non-DFS channel. <br />Sadly the tx-power is limited to 15dBm on this channels. <br />So after 30min I try to switch back to the orginal DFS channel, which should comply with regulatory restrictions (Non-Occupancy Time) in Europe. </p><p>Maybe I modify the script to switching to a different DFS-channel and not just back to the original, but only if I have to much wifi-resets.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 13 Jun 2016, 23:55)</p>

					<p>Thx Eleon216! This is exactly what I am looking for. I&#039;ll give it a try.</p><p>Issue with the outdoor channels is that - at least in Germany - the operator needs to ensure that no other services like wheather radars are getting disturbed. Otherwise it can get expensive in terms if liability. So leaving the channel and switching back after some minutes still might not be the proper legal way but should do the job. I anyway doubt that there is a real issue in terms of disturbing other services as my other router never leaves channel 104 but OpernWRT does... It looks more like the implementation is not perfect yet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>luup</strong> on 15 Jun 2016, 00:12)</p>
