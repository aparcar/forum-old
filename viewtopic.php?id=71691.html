					<p>I have a Linksys WRT1900ACS with OpenWRT 15.05 on it.</p><p>I have followed the &quot;OpenVPN tutorial for beginners&quot; from this web step by step (changing the local references like IP address...etc) and I got it running.</p><p>I imported the *.ovpn configuration file into the OpenVPN official app on my Android smartphone running LineageOS 7.1.2 and it connects correctly to the server on my router. I see the real WAN IP of my network, it assigns me an IP in the VPN range (10.8.0.X) and the bytes in and out go up steadily. </p><p>But I cannot do any of the actions I was supposed to be able to while connected to my VPN, that is, navigate as if I were a local machine connected to the router, and therefore with the WAN IP of the rest of devices (If I visit a whatismyip site, it shows the mobile network IP, not the WAN IP). I cannot accessany of the local resources of the local network by typing the local address (i.e. I cannot SSH the router on 192.168.1.1:22 but I can do it by introducing the WAN IP like when I am out of my network 92.176.88.125:22)... I double cheked I allowed the traffic from VPN to LAN and viceversa and from VPN to WAN.</p><p>VPN --&gt; LAN<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_lan_in=forwarding<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_lan_in.src=vpn<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_lan_in.dest=lan</p><p>LAN --&gt; VPN<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_lan_out=forwarding<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_lan_out.src=lan<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_lan_out.dest=vpn</p><p>VPN --&gt; WAN<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_wan=forwarding<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_wan.src=vpn<br />uci set firewall.vpn_forwarding_wan.dest=wan</p><p>Any hints?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jfromeo</strong> on 1 Aug 2017, 12:06)</p>
