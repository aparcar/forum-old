					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I was flashing my WL-500gP V2 today with different firmware (started with Oleg&#039;s firmware from wl500g.info, created a chroot OpenWRT environment, then used this to put OpenWRT as the main firmware). This worked fine, until I decided to flash this file: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/brcm47xx-2.6/openwrt-brcm47xx-2.6-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7 … uashfs.trx</a>, because I needed a 2.6 kernel. I said to use this one instead of building my own, but after mtd finished writing, the reboot command didn&#039;t work, and I got I/O errors. I said this is normal, because after all I&#039;ve overwritten the filesystem I was running from. I left it alone for a minute, then I cut power to the router and powered it back on. It didn&#039;t come back on <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I tried the recovery procedure that I found in various posts, but no luck. It doesn&#039;t respond to either the configured IP or the default IP, and there&#039;s no traffic that tcpdump can sense from the router. My first idea was that this image doesn&#039;t have the network drivers for the wl500gPv2, but I don&#039;t know how valid this affirmation is. The other is that the image is plain incompatible.</p><p>Can anyone help me restore functionality? Or has it become an expensive paperweight?</p><p>This information may help me not brick a second unit that I&#039;m getting tomorrow, or at least get it into a recoverable state.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>i think you cut the power too soon. the actual flashing is done after transfering the file..&nbsp; it takes 3-4 minutes... </p><p>i guess you need a jtag cable.</p><p>you can try and power it on with the reset button pressed then try to tftp it... don&#039;t know.. i&#039;ve been playing a lot with&nbsp; wl500gp v1 and bricked it and unbricked it a lot of times. it&#039;s not a dead end by all means.</p><p>(edit: anyway, the 7.09 kernel 2.6 firmware you used, it&#039;s HIGHLY UNSTABLE! i highly recommend you compile latest svn yourself or try the snapshots from <a href="http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaze/snapshots/brcm47xx-2.6/">http://downloads.x-wrt.org/xwrt/kamikaz … m47xx-2.6/</a> )</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dlbogdan</strong> on 21 May 2008, 09:39)</p>

					<p>I have bricked this many times to say w/ confidence that you can recover. Keep the restore button pressed and swtich the power on. While the power led is flashing tftp your .trx file again.. go for a 15 min walk and it should work.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>radu.c wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hi all,</p><p>I was flashing my WL-500gP V2 today with different firmware (started with Oleg&#039;s firmware from wl500g.info, created a chroot OpenWRT environment, then used this to put OpenWRT as the main firmware).

					<p>For some reason, I can&#039;t get the router to respond on either the IP I set when using Oleg&#039;s firmware, nor the default IP, even though it&#039;s in diag mode. I have another router, a version 1, and I&#039;m happily flashing it using this method without any problems whatsoever. Anyway, I&#039;m making a serial cable, and I hope to be able to recover that router from the CFE, or see if I can use diag mode from the serial port for the same purpose.</p>									</div>

					<p>The second router got bricked today. And I didn&#039;t do anything out of the ordinary this time. I flashed the firmware as I usually do, and... it no longer starts after reboot. It won&#039;t even go into diag mode so I can upload new firmware by TFTP. Any idea why?</p><p>I tried again the first router with the firmware restoration tool, because that one goes into diag mode. The firmware restoration doesn&#039;t find it on the network. The serial cable adapter is on the back burner right now.</p><p>Both are v2 routers. I have a v1 which, so far, works without a glitch.</p>									</div>

					<p>IIRC the WL-500g Premium v2 is only supported in recent trunk revisions. Means, best is if you compile by yourself.</p>									</div>
