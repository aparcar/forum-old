					<p>Has anyone successfully compiled the Unison file synchronizer for OpenWRT recently?</p><p>I found <a href="https://github.com/tobiaswaldvogel/openwrt-addpack/issues/11">a feed with a makefile for it</a>, but it&#039;s three years old and fails in the ocaml link phase.&nbsp; It looks like the OpenWRT build is passing a lot of extra options to ocamlopt (see the bug report, linked above).&nbsp; I&#039;ve reported the issue on the author&#039;s git repository, but given the age of the package, I&#039;m not expecting a response.</p><p>I&#039;m totally new to the OpenWRT build system and cross-compiling in general.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does my overridden CFLAGS hunch seem correct?&nbsp; Is there an easy fix?</p><p>Suggestions appreciated!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dsjustice</strong> on 7 Mar 2016, 05:41)</p>
