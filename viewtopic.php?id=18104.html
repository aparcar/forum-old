					<p>I have a a V2.2 WRT54G running 7.09 kamikaze. It supportw iwconfig and also the &quot;wl&quot; utility. I&#039;m often in an area with multiple AP&#039;s with the same SSID but without any kind of dynamic roaming/routing. So when it drifts between the two AP&#039;s, it makes me have to kick udhcpc on the WRT, and of course all my connections reset. Not fun.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried using &quot;iwconfig wl0 ap xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&quot;, and it doesn&#039;t give me any errors, but if I then do an &quot;iwconfig wl0 essid myssid&quot; afterwards it picks a different AP, usually the opposite one.&nbsp; </p><p>If I issue the &quot;iwconfig wl0 essid myssid&quot; command first, and then the &quot;iwconfig wl0 ap&quot; command, the WRT *appears* to stay locked to that AP as long as I don&#039;t issue the SSID command afterwards, but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;ll stay that way for any length of time or if I&#039;m doing it the right way.</p>									</div>
