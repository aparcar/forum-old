					<p>Hi, I am a complete newbie at this so please forgive me if I am asking stupid questions. I purchased a used WRT-54GL with Firmware: DD-WRT v23 (12/25/05) loaded. I bought it with the view to set up an access point in my neighbourhood (Plumstead) so that we could eventually have a little community net going here, I gather that is the aim of many in this group as well. I do have a problem that I need help with though:</p><p>I managed to connect to the router and all seems well. When I do a &quot;survey&quot; it picks up my Mega-100WR2 (Lastest firmware installed) wireless ADSL router/modem which is currently connected to the internet. I then click on &quot;Join&quot; and get passed to another screen. At that point everything comes to a halt. I can no longer connect to the linksys, in fact I cannot even pick it up on my laptop&#039;s wireless application screen. Is there anyone out there that could help.</p><p>Thanx<br />S</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>First, the &quot;Howtos and Documentation&quot; forum is where you post when you want to tell everybody how to do something, not when you want to ask how to do something.&nbsp; (Although many people make the same mistake.)</p><p>Second, DD-WRT is not OpenWrt.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com">http://www.dd-wrt.com</a>/ .&nbsp; They are more likely to be able to help you with the problem you&#039;re having.</p><p>Since you&#039;re in Cape Town, you might want to talk to these guys: <a href="http://www.ctwug.za.net">http://www.ctwug.za.net</a>/</p><p>By the way, the <a href="http://www.telkomphones.co.za/mega100.htm">Telkom Mega 100WR2</a> is a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/AR7Port">Texas Instruments AR7</a>, which is also supported by OpenWrt Kamikaze.&nbsp; The last time I tried the wireless on an AR7 (which was a while ago and not a Mega 100WR2) it hung the box or didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Other people have had more luck with wireless on Kamikaze on AR7.</p>									</div>
