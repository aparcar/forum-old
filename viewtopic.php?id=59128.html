					<p>I see i&#039;m not the only one who struggles with NoDogSplash</p><p>I would like to ask if someone can walk us trough the NoDogSplash inner workings.</p><p>One step at a time.</p><p>Goal, a better understanding of it all. And hopefully this can lead to a better documentation.&nbsp; The wiki doesn&#039;t seem to do the trick in it&#039;s current state. But without knowing how nodogsplash works it&#039;s hard to figure out how the wikipage can be improved.</p><p>I&#039;m a noob myself, don&#039;t even understand all the OpenWRT basics yet. So please try to explain it like you would explain to grandma that the &#039;any&#039; key is NOT on the bottom of the keyboard. When she 100% convinced that the any key IS on the bottom of the keyboard, since the all knowing windows helpdesk agent has told her so, and he is an all knowing GOD..</p><p>I mean, lets find a way that also explains to &#039;Noobs of the future&#039; how it all works. </p><p>Thanks in advance dear NoDogSplash oracle.</p>									</div>

					<p>hm, no oracles?&nbsp; </p><p>Let&#039;s try a question:&nbsp; 2 scenarios:</p><p>WAN or WWAN does it make a difference?&nbsp; And if not why does there seem to be a difference.<br />When using a WWAN to connect to the outside then things stop to work.&nbsp; using CCrc2 on a NEXX 3020 Is this normal, bug, or misconfiguration? </p><p>How to configure NoDogSplash for WWAN:<br />Any tips hints suggestions?</p><p>I have tried several things and i&#039;m lost in noobiness.<br />How does a WRT pro user start to tackle this?</p>									</div>
