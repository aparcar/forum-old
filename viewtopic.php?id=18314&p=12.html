You really laid a lot of options out for us here and I&#039;ve had plenty to test without having to compile my own. Have you or could you consider a project request: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=99896#p99896">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 896#p99896</a> (?)</p><p>It just seems with the space limitations that maybe a two-fold approach could be undertaken, one with wireless capabilities and the other with wired ETHERNET. But maybe a better all around build could be accomplished. I myself was looking for some packages that would enhance the switching function for network streaming HD video over TCP protocol but maybe the switch itself is the weak link. For fast forward and skipping ahead HD streams, the switch seems to slow given its 100MBps speed. A gigabit switch works better despite the fact that the devices streaming are only 100MBps.</p><p>Anyway, I thought the LAN and WAN Qos could make a difference which is why Gargoyle interested me. Tomato looks interesting as well but at least for streaming, I may have to consider another router.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The router is fairly stable using the latest bleeding edge trunks but wireless users are lacking some encryption as noted in the thread.</p><p>Looking forward to testing some new things with this router; thanks again!</p>									</div>

Please help!</p><p>Thank you</p></blockquote></div><p>If I&#039;m not mistaken, the holding reset during power-on is part of the 30-30-30 NVRAM thorough reset (also referred to as a hard reset) which is holding reset for 90 seconds, in three 30 second intervals, starting with power on (start 30 second holds), power off (continue holding) and finally releasing 30 seconds after re-applying power. This s/b done before and after a flash but will not clear a flash. Interestingly, I&#039;ve not done the 30-30-30 hard reset before or after a flash with my D-Link DIR-615C1 at any time but I read it&#039;s a must for the new NEWD2 flashes in DD-WRT (not this model but came upon some notes while researching other routers) and those are still considered beta and could still brick some routers.</p><p>Have you tried simply cycling power and then holding reset until the power LED flashes, to get to recovery flash? (This worked well with my D-Link DIR-615C1 but if it is already flashing try to telnet the original IP (if you had flashed OpenWrt previously) or try default recovery flash IP.) Default gateway s/b 192.168.10.1 on subnet 255.255.255.0 so use IP 192.168.10.x for static IP on PC. But since some have said that recovery thinks the router is a D-Link, maybe they meant that the recovery IP reverts to 192.168.0.1 (gateway) so try it again with subnet 255.255.255.0 and PC set to static in range of 192.168.0.x.</p><p>Just a thought, the file you flashed downloads as a .zip; I would think that it wouldn&#039;t flash until it&#039;s unzipped. Sorry if you&#039;ve already tried these and find this is just old info.</p><p>Otherwise, you may need to recover it with the JTAG serial cable but I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s been done successfully in this forum with Athros. The DD-WRT WIP thread shows the JTAG pin-out but the notes were incomplete, IIRC. Good Luck!</p>									</div>

DO NOT HIT BACK OR FORWARD OR STOP OR ANYTHING). </p><p>4) When the update completes successfully and the router reboots, it will come back w/ the Trendnet 1.10.08 firmware.&nbsp; I recommend pressing the reset button again to restore factory settings.&nbsp; You will need to re-configure your network settings to obtain IP address automatically as your DHCP server on your unit is now enabled and is listening on the factory IP of 192.168.10.1.&nbsp; If your router isn&#039;t listening on 192.168.10.1, press and hold the reset button while the unit is on to restore factory settings OR try to go to your most recently configured LAN settings as the flash process may have retained those settings if you changed them before your router got hosed.</p><p>5) If step 3 failed OR the recovery flash UI indicated the 652BRP file is still invalid after changing the product ID, try using the TEW-632BRP 1.10.B13 (1.10.13) Firmware (TEW632BRPA1_FW110B13__652.bin )</p><p>6) If this file works, afterwards you can then repeat steps 1 - 3 above using the 652 1.10.08 file but before you do, modify the product ID at the end of the bin file to match the product ID in the TEW 632 file you flashed previously.</p><p>7) When the router reboots, you&#039;ll now notice it says its a 652 router</p><p>8) At this point, you can re-flash from the Trendnet Firmware Update GUI (not the recover flash mode) an up-to-date factory firmware.&nbsp; OR you can flash to OpenWrt using the OpenWrt-ar71xx-tew-652brp-squashfs.uni or the DIR 615 rev C 3.11 firmware (obtained from Dlink site).</p><p>NOTE:.uni files work, if you get an invalid file error during the flash process edit the file and change the product ID to match your tew-652brp unit (u can also copy and paste it from the last working flash file you used).</p><p>NOTE: To put on the DLink DIR-615 REV C firmware, I had to start with 3.01 version of the firmware first (remember to update the flash file with the TEW-652 product ID using a hex editor like Notepad++).&nbsp; Use the recovery flash mode to flash the unit to 3.01 and after the unit has been flashed and reboots, you can use the DLink GUI to upgrade the firmware to 3.11.</p><p>Long story short, to recover a bricked TEW-652 to stock firmware, you need to use the recovery console and flash to the original 652 1.10.08 firmware or 632 firmware and then convert back to 652.&nbsp; After which you can then flash to OpenWrt or DLINK DIR Rev C (earlier revisions are not Atheros based, so make sure its rev C 3.11) firmware (using the regular admin UI or the recover flash UI.. I can&#039;t quite clearly remember, but i think the DLink firmware has to be done via recovery mode, but i think i got OpenWrt firmware to work using the normal UI).</p><p>If i&#039;ve misreported anything, someone please correct me, but this is the best i could remember on what I did . I didn&#039;t take much notes along the way because i was trying to hit a moving target.&nbsp; It took hours of reading through these forums to figure how this all works.&nbsp; I hope this sums it up for people who run into this issue or just want to know how to put an open source firmware on their TEW-652BRP router.&nbsp; Also, if something doesn&#039;t seem clear, i recommend reading through RoundSparrow&#039;s and armchair&#039;s postings on this thread... it helped me out tremendously.</p><p>FILE LINKS:<br />OpenWrt TEW-652BRP Firmware snapshot: (i believe the only other option is to compile one yourself)<br /><a href="http://downloads.OpenWrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/OpenWrt-ar71xx-tew-652brp-squashfs.uni">http://downloads.OpenWrt.org/snapshots/ … uashfs.uni</a><br />After flashing to OpenWrt to get the web GUI working perform the following:<br />0.

His instructions should help TEW-652 users in this forum!</p><p>My refurbished D-Link DIR-615, C1 never did well with any version of D-Link f/w. I kept getting a randomly slow WAN connection and put up with that longer than I should have but was getting mixed answers from my ISP saying they were doing maintenence and upgrades to lines. But with the OpenWrt it&#039;s running very well and fast with wired-ETHERNET (no wireless here, I just ran wires through the attic to avoid wireless connections).</p><p>To add to Oddjob&#039;s comments, the D-Link f/w 3.10NA &amp; 3.11NA re-write the recovery flash and also locks the UI flash upgrade to 3.1xNA upgrades which will block any attempts to flash to third party f/w like OpenWrt. It may be different with Netgear but the D-Link devices will do this. There has been complaints in the D-Link forum about the 3.11NA f/w and desires to return to 3.01 but it&#039;s prohibited by D-Link&#039;s new policy. Not being down on D-Link but the forum has been calling D-Link to release a newer updated version of f/w but that request seems to be ignored on this build. To comply with open source, they offer a GPL code and d/l for developers. I think the major bug with the 3.11NA f/w is the SIP filter which needs to be un-checked it the user has a VOIP ATA behind the router.</p><p>If you find that you cannot return to third party f/w or Trendnet, follow Oddjob&#039;s suggestion in his first response about using a hex editor like Notepad++ (I use it and recommend it for simplicity and it&#039;s free) and change (just open and scroll to bottom/right for ID) your desired flash ID to: 00AP81-AR9130-RT-070614-02 This will defeat the steps taken by D-Link to prohibit third-party f/w upgrades. I think the developers in OpenWrt picked up on this and have corrected the 615C1 uni flashes in the latest trunk flashes for Kamikaze but your trendnet device may or may not be effected the same way (IDK?). If I&#039;m right on all that, you may be able to flash directly from D-Link 3.11NA f/w to latest trunk snapshot for 615-C1.uni </p><p>But make sure you hard reset router before and after flash to avoid the problems you started with. It wouldn&#039;t hurt to reset defaults in UI and then do the 30-30-30 hard reset. And if I&#039;m wrong, the recovery flash with the hex editor will get back out of D-Link f/w.</p>									</div>

					<p>What would be the advantage of switching to DD-Wrt? DD-Wrt was my first choice but OpenWrt looks easier to add packages, despite using the trunk snapshots.</p><p>I like to try packages and actually found some that work for me. siproxd is an easy SIP VOIP tool that requires no firewall configuration on my part. Some network tools I found and still use are frickin, privoxy and crowdcontrol which still fit along with luci-admin-full, luci-fastindex and luci-app-qos. This is a dedicated wired setup with no use for wireless. I just run ETHERNET cables rather than hassle with wireless. I have two PCs, two media streamers, and a VOIP adapter networked through a managed switch for BW limiting and vlans.</p><p>If I don&#039;t like a package; reflash latest trunk, verify md5sum and telnet the opkg update and opkg install of packages is a snap. I&#039;ve found that I don&#039;t even have to move my PC from switch to router. And I don&#039;t even have to cycle power to my modem, router or VOIP adapter to do any of this. And no configuring on my part except the downlink and uplink speeds of my network for Qos in Luci.</p><p>I have a gigabit router with beta Tomato that could probably run circles around this router but I&#039;d rather put OpenWrt on it than figure out that USB Optware workaround to add the packages so I&#039;m waiting on Oleg or OpenWrt for that. But then again, my network use is mostly local and no GB or TB of data to transfer and INTERNET is mostly for browsing, VOIP and occasional video downloads so this router supports my needs just fine for now. I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s a workhorse due to my demand but it&#039;s been very stable and reliable as my primary router. And I wouldn&#039;t go back D-Link f/w, even if they release another revision!</p><p>I do stream HD video but only locally, the switch is handling that task just fine also.</p><p>Thanks again OpenWrt developers!!!</p>									</div>
