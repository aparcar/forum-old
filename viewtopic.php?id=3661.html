					<p>Instead of trying to cram every possible feature into one firmware, OpenWrt provides only a minimal firmware with support for add-on packages. For users this means the ability to custom tune features, removing unwanted packages to make room for other packages and for developers this means being able to focus on packages without having to test and release an entire firmware. </p><br /><p>say it&#039;s claimed that openwrt provides only a minimal firmware with support for add-on packages.so where is the kernel,where is the farmiliar /usr/src/linux path,where is the wired and wireless network drivers placed?where is the classical linux kernel source tree,i am a little bit puzzled about this ,because i just want to learn something about the wireless network interface card driver and then try to contruct a wireless mesh network ,by the way,the wireless distribution system function may help me a lot,but where is the corresbonding code for the wireless distribution system,and pls tell me the main steps about how to construct a wireless mesh network,is both the linksys gpl code and the code from our kindly openwrt useful? thanks to everybody here^_^</p>									</div>
