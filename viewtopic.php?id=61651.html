					<p>Dear OpenWRT community,</p><p>I just received a new mobile Wireless/Ethernet Router/Bridge/Wifi Repeater called Vonets Mini 300.<br /><a href="http://vonets.com/ProductViews.asp?D_ID=57">http://vonets.com/ProductViews.asp?D_ID=57</a></p><p>The company behind that real tiny box doesn&#039;t offer any updates anymore and generally seems to suck badly at support <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>So I opened the small beauty, found two unpopulated round copper spots, welded some wire to it, connected to USB-to-serial adapter (red wire to rxd, black wire to txd), set the serial com to 57600 and saw this upon boot:<br /><a href="http://pastebin.com/Q0GbD6gs">http://pastebin.com/Q0GbD6gs</a></p><p>To get an idea how the board looks like, I made two photos:<br /><a href="http://www2.pic-upload.de/img/29182201/2015-12-20-VonetMini300-Top.jpg">http://www2.pic-upload.de/img/29182201/ … 00-Top.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://www2.pic-upload.de/img/29182200/2015-12-20-VonetMini300-Bottom.jpg">http://www2.pic-upload.de/img/29182200/ … Bottom.jpg</a></p><p>There are some ramips/MT7620N devices quite similar to this box supported already by OpenWRT. <br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/tag/mt7620n?do=showtag&amp;tag=MT7620N">https://wiki.openwrt.org/tag/mt7620n?do … ag=MT7620N</a></p><p>That&#039;s what I could come up with until now, and now I&#039;m stuck. How to continue?</p><p>Crosscompiling in Mac OS X seems a bit of hassle; also, I&#039;d need to get into the OpenWRT SDKs and so on. </p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Best regards,<br />Koepi</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>de_koepi</strong> on 21 Dec 2015, 12:12)</p>

					<p>Additional info:<br />While serial console Rx works well, I can&#039;t change the boot mode. I tried different settings and several times, it doesn&#039;t seem to accept my Tx attempts to boot into mode 4. Also tried 3.3V and 5V as signal level, no difference. I checked with shorting Rx and Tx that the keys I press are echoed back.</p><p>Thus flashing is not possible yet, as well.</p><p>I also wonder why the output stops at that point. Other devices start showing the interesting stuff from that point on.</p><p>That Pm25L0032 IC is a 32Mbit (4 MByte) SPI flash. The Winbond RAM IC has 32 MByte. The Suotek S16A-1102 is the PHY for the ethernet port. Other components are step-downs from 5V/USB to 3.3V and other voltages.<br />That IAEBE SOT23-8 IC is an MP2161 - 2A, 1.5MHz adjustable output synchronous step-down. <br />On the bottom side there is a SOT23-6 IC marked A7115; can&#039;t find a datasheet, but some Aliexpress offer indicating it&#039;s a Buck/boost as well. The TO-89/SOT-89 IC marked with BA RN seems to be a 1A, -40V PNP transistor 2SB1132. The rest is only capacitors, resistors and maybe ferrite beads.</p><p>I could try to connect that SPI flash via ATtiny, ATmega or STM32 microcontroller to flash data on it or to read it out, but that would take some time to program. It would be easier to order something like 25Q64 and have 8MByte of flash rom - and to solder that onto the board. The placement on the board is quite good for easy desoldering of the old SPI ROM.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>de_koepi</strong> on 21 Dec 2015, 10:07)</p>

					<p>On the &quot;top&quot; view of the board you can see two more of such contact pads next to the Mediatek core, right between the MT7620N line and the 1436BMAL line of the IC. Those are much harder to solder <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> From this view, the left one doesn&#039;t work as tx line, and the right one immediately lead to computer crash/restart when connecting to my Tx pin (shortcut on the USB-2-TTL adapter does that). Hm. The Vonets Mini board had no power at that time, weird.</p><p>Edit: Just found some equipment I had lying around. No need to desolder the SPI Flash. Should be possible to directly connect it now. Now looking for something simple like FTDI232RL-to-SPI for flashrom.<br /><a href="http://www2.pic-upload.de/img/29188969/2015-12-21-VonetsMini-SPIFlash-Access.jpg">http://www2.pic-upload.de/img/29188969/ … Access.jpg</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>de_koepi</strong> on 21 Dec 2015, 20:59)</p>

					<p>Further progress. It is possible to use the Next WT 3020 U-Boot. But due to the necessary padding all setup and information is lost. Something important like the Ethernet MAC address. It shows up as 00:00:00:00:00:00 now. Also, with the new U-Boot there is no hardcoded boot sequence which only allows to start from flash. I immediately could get into the U-Boot console, proving that vonets has locked their U-Boot.</p><p>To build the flash image completely, I now used:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=./vonets_padding_uboot.bin bs=1 count=131072
cat u-boot-nexx-3020-7620.bin vonets_padding_uboot.bin openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-4M-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin vonets-padding.bin &gt; vonets_uboot-wt3020_pad_openwrt-wt3020_pad.bin
flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/cu.usbserial-AM0212W4:115200 -w vonets_uboot-wt3020_pad_openwrt-wt3020_pad.bin -VV</code></pre></div><p>Now I&#039;m stuck with the MAC address issue. If rebooted, the Kernel still stops at the &quot;Kernel is starting&quot; stage. Hmhmhm.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Since the MAC address is stored on a special address in the flash, I&#039;m using the Nexx WT3020 U-Boot, but cut out the last 128kb from the original flash rom content (in U-Boot you can&#039;t setenv ethaddr, it&#039;s blocked.) So new flash image like this ...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=./vonets_uboot.bin of=./vonets_nvram.bin bs=1 skip=196608 count=131072

Result: The correct MAC address is back.<br />Still, the kernel stops when the &quot;Starting Kernel...&quot; message appears.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Next try. Maybe those sysupdate-.bins are not suitable for direct flashing.<br />I downloaded the generic uImage and root.squashfs for mt7620. As the flash image size changes, the final padding file has to be created in the proper size:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=./vonets-padding-neu.bin bs=1 count=409210

					<p>Last test for today: Cut out the Kernel and rootfs from the original firmware dump (basically just skipping the leading 327680 bytes with U-Boot+&quot;nvram&quot;).

					<p>Now I even dared starting building my own OpenWRT image. Took hours to setup and compile, and guess what - _nearly_ the same result. Somehow the entry point is indeed different now.
