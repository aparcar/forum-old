					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;ve installed Barrier Breaker r36730 on two Linksys WRT54GS. I would like to let run Luci only accepting https-connects, so I&#039;ve installed luci-ssl.</p><p>The problem: when I try to connect to luci first time, connecting does only work directly after starting the uhttpd (/etc/init.d/uhttpd start). Half a minute later, and uhttpd is running into 98% when try to connect with https.<br />Even after that moment I&#039;m not able to get the certificate - same problem, uhttpd is running into 98%. I have to restart uhttpd and then download the certificate immediately after starting.<br />After doing so, everything works fine.</p><p>Very strange thing: this seems to happen only first time after starting the unit uhttpd has to deliver the cert. When this worked first time, getting the cert at the next time seems to be no problem.</p><p>Has anybody an idea what&#039;s going wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t think barrier breaker was supported on the old WRT54 devices. There is limited memory which causes issues. Or so I thought.</p>									</div>
