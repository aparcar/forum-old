					<p>Howdy,</p><p>I just got my ASUS wl-520gu V2 from NewEgg ($49 with shipping).&nbsp; I used svn to download kamikaze top-of-trunk and atftp to flash the router.&nbsp; After flashing the generated image openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx, the router becomes unresponsive (no ping, no telnet, no ssh, no http, nothing).&nbsp; Fortunately this router is unbrickable, and I was able to flash the ASUS firmware back on to it thus confirming that I was flashing it correctly.</p><p>My question is: what could I be doing wrong?&nbsp; The wiki and other postings on this forum indicate that kamikaze TOT generally works on this router.&nbsp; Could I have been so unlucky to catch a broken trunk?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; I changed only two parameters in &quot;make menuconfig&quot;: I selected the Broadcom 47XX/53XX target, and turned off wireless support (I don&#039;t need it and I am not even sure it works).</p><p>Any theory would be appreciated!<br />Thanks much in advance.</p><p>Luigi</p><p>P.S. The size of the TRX file is 1773568 bytes.</p>									</div>

					<p>If anybody is interested, I got kamikaze to work when I used linux 2.4 instead of 2.6.&nbsp; I also updated to release 12259 as it was the one reported to work on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL520GU">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ us/WL520GU</a>.&nbsp; I&#039;m off to mix my vodka drink now.&nbsp; Salute!</p>									</div>
