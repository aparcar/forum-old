After I did some modification to my new thime, such as changing pictures, changing some styles in html and so. THen I did issued &quot;make&quot; command but it did not modify files in the bin, build directory. So i wonder if you can help me to recompile after modification done to mytheme. Do I have to clean and recompile again? but I do not want to clean whole Openwrt compilation, just the part that i did make changes. HOw to tell to know which changes has been done in order to recompile only the modified part.</p>									</div>
