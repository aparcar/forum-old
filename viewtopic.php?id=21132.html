					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am writing because I have a outdoor activity field that I would like to add WIFI but I would like to have a captive portal that requires users to have a user id and password to login into the network. Also once logged in I would like the user to be redirected to a site of my choice. I was wondering how I can use the OpenWRT software to accomplish this. Please any and all help is appreciated. Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

You can go with&nbsp; chillispot or coova-chilli, check out the settings for the respective package.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After that you need to create the captive portal page.&nbsp; For this use following url as the reference - </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.chillispot.info/chilliforum/viewtopic.php?id=18">http://www.chillispot.info/chilliforum/ â€¦ .php?id=18</a></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will recommend you to go with php version of captive portal.</p><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope this will help you.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
