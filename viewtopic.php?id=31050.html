					<p>For a simple upgrade, default options will probably suffice. But if you really want to make sure all the files are preserved (including those NOT in /etc), then you can create a tar.gz archive of the files and use -f option.</p>									</div>

					<p>The list of files preserved is by default in /lib/upgrade/keep.d. Additionally files returned by &#039;opkg list-changed-conffiles&#039; are also preserved.</p><p>SAVE_OVERLAY saves complete /overlay directory (this is the writable part of the filesystem that gets merged with /rom to create a uniform / tree). /overlay contains changed config files, additional packages installed and anything that was written to the router. There&#039;s no rule what needs to be saved...sometimes I install additional packages but then include them in the later firmware builds, so I don&#039;t have to preserve those. Sometimes files are modified and the new firmware already contains the modifications so those are also not needed. But config files are needed or router will boot with default settings. But those are preserved by default (unless using -n).</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>... does this mean, I make an archive.tar.gz of /etc and /root for example and sysupgrade -f archive.tar.gz will flash the router and afterwards restores the configs from this archive?</p></blockquote></div><p>That&#039;s what is says: &#039;restore configuration from .tar.gz (file or url)&#039;. Anything archived in the tgz will be written to /overlay after the flash. This way you can hand-pick the files that will be the system after new firmware boot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Great explanation, gulikoza, many thanks!</p><p>So these will be the files that are preserved by default on my system just doing systemupgrade without any options:</p><p>from /lib/upgrade/keep.d/base-files<br />/etc/shadow<br />/etc/config/<br />/etc/dropbear/<br />/etc/crontabs/</p><p>from /lib/upgrade/keep.d/base-files-essential<br />/etc/hosts<br />/etc/inittab<br />/etc/group<br />/etc/passwd<br />/etc/profile<br />/etc/shells<br />/etc/sysctl.conf<br />/etc/rc.local</p><p>from /lib/upgrade/keep.d/firewall<br />/etc/firewall.user</p><p>from opkg list-changed-conffiles<br />/etc/passwd<br />/etc/config/network<br />/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key<br />/etc/dropbear/dropbear_dss_host_key<br />/etc/config/firewall</p><p>But these files are probably not preserved and lost after sysupgrade on my system:</p><p>/overlay/etc/config/firewall.orig (a backup-copy I made)<br />/overlay/etc/config/gw6c.orig (a backup-copy I made)<br />/overlay/etc/rc.d/S45firewall (lost or persistent?)<br />/overlay/etc/rc.d/S45gw6c (lost or persistent?)<br />/overlay/root/.ssh/known_hosts</p><p>Or will the startlinks for the firewall and gw6c (gogo6-client) be recreated after the reflash?
