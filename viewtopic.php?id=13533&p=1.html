					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently switch my configuration. I have 2 asus wl-500g premium.<br />They were previously linked with 1 main AP, and the other as a client, and wired PCs on this clients. But there were issues, so I decided to change it. Now, I have a WDS link. it works great, but I don&#039;t know why, after about 2-4 days, all my port forwarding stopped working (it&#039;s the 3rd time in 2 weeks, and and change my configuration 2 weeks ago).<br />I didn&#039;t have this problem before.</p><p>I try restarting /etc/init.d/network, /etc/init.d/dnsmasq, /etc/init.d/firewall, /etc/init.d/qos... without success.<br />The only way I found to recover my port forwarding is to reboot the main router (the one with firewall, port forwarding, etc).</p><p>I need another solution, because it&#039;s not very interesting to reboot every day (if I know what is the problem, I could make a cron every night for example, I don&#039;t want that cron to reboot my router ! )</p><p>Thx</p>									</div>

					<p>well, as noted before; it seems to work when you don&#039;t specify the ports. That way it just tries to forward the connection to the same ports on the inside, which seems to work correctly</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi dstensnes, for me this is a temporal issue, it seems to happen at a random time after 24 hours. I am using the firewall scripts i will delve into that and see if that is specifying the destination port. I havent tested to see if the ports are being redirected to a different port after this initial time period where it is working ok, however the issue does sound very similair to what i have seen so far (i couldnt even ssh into the box this time it went nuts where as before i could and only a few port forwards were affected).</p>									</div>

					<p>if you enter &#039;forward:proto=tcp dport=116:10.0.0.2:22&#039; in /etc/config/firewall, it will result in something like this in the NAT table:<br />&nbsp; iptables -A prerouting_wan -p tcp -m multiport --dports 116 -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.2</p><p>which will just rewrite the address, and send it to 10.0.0.2, but if you specifiy ports with it, it will also try to map the destinationport<br />to a new destination port, relative to the start of the portrange, which i believe is what causing the problem. Maybe some offset or<br />something which is not always properly reset, or something like that.

					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I&#039;m experiencing similar problems; ASUS WL-500GP, kamikaze 7.09.</p><p>The problem for me appears more readily with the iptables rule:</p><p>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -p tcp --dport 80 -s ! 192.168.210.7 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8090</p><p>Which under white russian worked fine and never exhibited any problems. This rule now stops working, sometimes almost immediately, sometimes it may take a few days. When inspecting packets, it almost looks like the router just stops forwarding/natting the packets to the required destination. Admittedly I haven&#039;t performed a tcpdump at the recieving end and haven&#039;t seen the port change as mentioned by others. What I have done has been very brief.</p><p>I&#039;ve also notice my imaps DNAT rule stops too, but the smtp DNAT is still functioning. So it appears to be isolated to individual rules and not something that globally breaks.</p><p>No amount of jiggery pokery fixes the issue, a reboot is required. That possibly indicates the kernel is at fault and I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m willing to test the 2.6 branch yet, I don&#039;t believe webif2 has been ported and I think the status is wip for wl-500gp. I might just have to give it a go for the sake of testing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Aaaannnnnd.... its broken again. Okay; So multiport is not the cause of the problem. Dang. The bug has already been reported, now maybe more people can confirm they have this problem.

After a certain time the forwarded port gets increased, or as I saw today, decreased in value. So incoming port 10001 tcp &amp; udp , for example, should be forwarded as 10001, but to a different IP naturally, but after a time the router decides to map the incoming port to 10002 or even higher, or as I saw today, to 9999. It seems the longer you wait , the higher the port number becomes. At least, that is what I experienced.

					<p>Well actually, people do care. It&#039;s just that the bugs will not get fixed in the versions they are found in.&nbsp; Such is the development model of OpenWRT. As as stated in this link, Kamikaze is very much a moving target:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5487">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5487</a></p><p>If you want to see something fixed, then try the latest development version from svn / git:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org">https://dev.openwrt.org</a>/</p><p>Officially, binaries will not be realesed and supported. In reality, binaries do get released, but are still unsupported. So if you want to use Kamikaze, then be prepared to get your hands dirty or stick with White Russian. I myself did not realize this when I switched from WR to Kamikaze. So now I run bleeding edge Kamikaze and it is quite fun. Not fit for production environments though.</p>									</div>
