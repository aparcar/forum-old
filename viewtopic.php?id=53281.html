					<p>As a big fan of OpenWRT since many years I would like to present my special OpenWRT project:</p><p>AudiculaPi - the tiny media server for your Raspberry Pi</p><p>based on<br />OpenWRT- WIRELESS FREEDOM<br />CHAOS CALMER (Bleeding Edge, r42624)</p><p>but due to many USB problems I had with OpenWRT&#039;s default kernel, I integrated same kernel as raspbian uses available at github: Kernel 3.12.28 works fine with usb, also recent firmware files are installed at image.</p><p>The image is available at SF: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/audiculapi/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/audiculapi/</a><br />Additionally there a lot of media (e.g. DVB) kernel drivers available as extra archive (look for kernel_3_12_28_drivers.tar.bz2 at project page), which OpenWRT does not provide by default.</p><p>OpenWRT features of course:<br />* Minimalistic system, installed and running on a just 256MB sized SD card<br />* AudiculaPi provides a detailed Web Browser GUI with multi language support</p><p>Already preinstalled:<br />* Internet Radio / MP3 /OGG / FLAC etc. with Music Player Daemon v0.18.16 <br />&nbsp; (with IR &amp; bluetooth remote control support, LCD support based on PyDPF)<br />* IPTV / DVB-T/S/C recorder with TVHeadEnd 3.9 (resp. MuMuDVB 2)<br />* SAMBA Server<br />* SSH/SFTP Server<br />* WEBSERVER (luci powered - https://[RPI&#039;s IP ADRESS])<br />* MiniDLNA<br />* Shairport<br />* Avahi<br />* WebCAM Video Streaming with mjpeg-streamer<br />* NTP client / server<br />* WLAN client and / or access point<br />* Homeautomation with FHEM </p><p>And you know many, many additional packages are available via web based GUI installation powered by OpenWRT repository !</p><p>Cheers, irimi</p>									</div>
