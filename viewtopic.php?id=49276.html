					<p>Hello. <br />I&#039;m trying to make OpenWRT run on ZyXEL Keenetic Giga router (it&#039;s almost same as ZyXEL NBG4615). It has RT3052 CPU and AR8316 Gigabit switch. </p><p>Took DIR-620-A1 profile as base, in make kernel_menuconfig enabled&nbsp; AR8216_PHY (Driver for Atheros AR8216 switches) but swconfig list shows only &quot;Found: switch0 - rt305x&quot; internal SOC switch.<br />Tried enabling CONFIG_MII (Generic Media Independent Interface device support) - still no luck. <br />It&#039;s nothing in dmesg about AR8316, so it&#039;s looks like driver not see switch. But driver is loaded: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ls /sys/bus/mdio_bus/drivers/Atheros\ AR8216!AR8236!AR8316/
bind    uevent  unbind</code></pre></div><p>What can I try to make switch work?</p><p>Thank You.</p>									</div>
