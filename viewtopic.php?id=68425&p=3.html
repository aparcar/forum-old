					<p>So I received my 3200ACM today.&nbsp; For baseline testing I swapped out my ACS and configured the rango unit in its place.&nbsp; Initial testing is pretty positive.</p><p>Other than the nuisance wifi leds not working (which I&#039;ve seen reported elsewhere and haven&#039;t looked into at all) the only issue I&#039;ve noticed is with the 5G wireless performance.</p><p>As of now the Shelby unit is rocking (this is the 1900ACS, for comparison) -- I can load multiple high bandwidth streams and they hold around 25 MB/sec each.&nbsp; I started a file transfer on the rango unit and was getting better than 30 MB/sec, but when I started a second transfer (iperf over openvpn to test throughput) the file transfer bottomed out at around 3 MB/sec.&nbsp; Also, I usually keep a VNC tunnel going to a remote machine and the screen quality reduced to poor and stayed that way.&nbsp; I tried a few things but only rebooting improved both transfer speed and VNC video quality.</p><p>So a promising start but definitely room for improvement on the 5G.</p>									</div>

So, 3g and 5g LED configurations were added, and appeared to work initially, but within a few minutes, all the wifi clients dropped, and could not reconnect.

I have a couple of iphone 7&#039;s that can supposedly take advantage of tri-band, but in preliminary tests, they wouldn&#039;t take advantage though the router was set to 160mhz. Using a Amazon fireTV box connected via 5g wifi, youtube was selected with automatic video playing, and when I woke up in the morning, video&#039;s were still playing.</p><p>So, besides the LED&#039;s, and 160mhz (tri-band), it&#039;s working well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a note that I&#039;m rethinking how best to integrate the Rango device into my network for testing.&nbsp; Initially I was going to replace my Shelby with it but that&#039;s turning out to be a bad idea (it&#039;s currently in that spot up and running, with some downsides).&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen data rates slow to a crawl (&lt; 1 MB/s) and a wifi crash requiring a reboot when multiple simultaneous demands are placed on the 5G network.&nbsp; Typical use I haven&#039;t seen any obvious issues.</p><p>I&#039;m going to move it to a lower demand isolated network for more structured testing and as the driver improves I&#039;d like to see it back in the &quot;prime&quot; spot.</p><p>I did verify that WDS is working on this unit as well so it can be used easily as a wifi bridge.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t worked with it or tested that with other units so no idea how it impacts performance.</p><p>@tapper I built from LEDE trunk (and updated mwlwifi to the latest commit) but you might want to start with the RC.&nbsp; Trunk has updated busybox to 1.26.2 so you&#039;ll need to take care in reconstructing your .config (unless you already have that done).</p>									</div>

					<p>@lifehacksback<br />Sorry for any confusion, trunk currently has the latest commit it just calls out the wrong date on the version.&nbsp; So my patch is pulling the same version as trunk, just updating the version to the commit date.</p>									</div>

(puke) It can&#039;t even be used with a screen reader i had to get my wife to help me flash in the first place.

					<p>In case someone is interested... the acm will run snort. With the wifi issues on-going, I thought it would be a good time to see if it would... It uses 80% of the RAM, but processor utilization looks good under normal traffic load. So far I&#039;m impressed with its power.</p><p>Let me know if someone would like the snort and snort.conf </p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>
