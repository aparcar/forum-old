					<p>Have you already tried the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">generic failsafe</a>?<br />You could probably skip stages 2-3 from that page and just keep clicking &#039;reset&#039; button while the router boots up. If suddenly status led will start blinking 4x times faster than usual bootup blinking rate, then you&#039;re probably entered the failsafe mode.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Graham is not the only one having &quot;bricked?&quot; his WDR4900. I now have done the same thing using&nbsp; Jeffrey87&#039;s image and by changing some network parameters in my 2 WDR4900. <br />I had purchased these to replace 2 WRT54g running DDWRT with Gigabit Routers in order to have faster Video transfers between my NAS and some workstations in my local network. <br />No problems with the firmware upgrade and running both routers as switches in DHCP Client mode. the DHCP Server and Internet Gateway is installed on my Freebox. Having changed the parameters for IPV6 6to4 both routers do not respond to pings anymore and since I saw the message from eximido about the reset script a little bit late so&nbsp; I did not add his little script to be able to do a &quot;first boot&quot; reset.<br />The reset results of my reset actions are the same than those Graham described.<br />My questions: Is there anybody who could give me a hint?<br />1)&nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose that I have to re-flash my routers with either the OpenWRT bin or with the latest TP-link bin which already worked. I have had a look at the bin files:&nbsp; Can I reflash the &quot;TL-WDR4900n_v1_boot(121211).bin&quot; as is? <br />2)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anybody who can give me a description /photo of pins of the serial layout on the board of the WDR4900?<br />Thanks for reading me….<br />Peter</p>									</div>
