					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;d like to hear your comments about an idea I just had.</p><p>Today the OpenWRT writable FS is implemented as a UnionFS between a SquashFS and a JFFS2. I&#039;d like to suggest a new concept called &quot;Temporary mode&quot;. When activated by the user, a new tmpfs with a size at least as large as the JFFS2 (presumably larger) will be created, the entire content of the JFFS2 will be copied to it and the UnionFS will be changed so the tmpfs replaces the JFFS2 (SquashFS is still used).</p><p>From that point on any modification made by the user will be stored on the tmpfs rather than the flash. The user may at any time cancel the temporary mode, in which case the content of the tmpfs may or may not be copied back to the JFFS2 (according to the user&#039;s choice - &quot;commit changes&quot; / &quot;revert changes&quot;) and the tmpfs will be deleted.</p><p>Temporary mode may have several significant benefits:<br />1. Experiments on different configurations / software may be performed without risk of bricking the device or even needing the use of recovery mode - if the device stops responding - just reset and everything is reverted.<br />2. Allow temporary installation of large software packages that would not normally fit onto the device&#039;s flash.<br />3. Experiment on different configurations / software without performing many writes to the flash, which may degrade it quicker.</p><p>Would like to hear your thoughts.</p>									</div>
