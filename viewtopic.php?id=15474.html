					<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk/adsl_ethernet_modem_dm111p.php">Netgear DM111P</a> ethernet modem off ebay recently.&nbsp; When it arrived, I plugged it in and straight away the power LED -which should be a solid green - went to solid red.&nbsp; The user manual says this means either the self test is in progress or the self test has failed.&nbsp; I waited long enough (30+ mins) to confirm the router is bricked.<br />I would like to reflash the Netgear firmware, however, since the router is bricked I can&#039;t use the DM111P&#039;s web interface (<a href="http://192.168.0.1">http://192.168.0.1</a>).</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.castalie.org/projects/DM111P.html">this site</a> the DM111P has a TTL serial connector and I&#039;ve opened up my DM111P and confirmed it has one.&nbsp; So I thought - rightly or wrongly - with the right hardware I could use a serial console to flash the Netgear firmware to the DM111P.</p><p>As the TTL port is 3.3v, I bought <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;itemcount=2&amp;_trkparms=algo%3DCRX%26its%3DS%252BI%26itu%3DUCI%252BSI%26otn%3D2&amp;refwidgetloc=closed_view_item&amp;usedrule1=CrossSell_LogicX&amp;viewitem=&amp;refitem=260230856084&amp;item=260234256147&amp;refwidgettype=cross_promot_widget&amp;_trksid=p284.m183">this</a> 3.3v-TTL-to-RS232 Serial Converter.&nbsp; My IBM Thinkpad T40 doesn&#039;t have a serial port so I bought <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/USB-to-Serial-RS-232-DB9-Adaptor-Converter-Cable-Lead_W0QQitemZ300219011854QQihZ020QQcategoryZ41995QQcmdZViewItem">this</a> Prolific PL2303 USB-to-Serial adapter to use instead.</p><p>The problem now, is that I basically don&#039;t know what to do next.<br />When I plug the Prolific PL2303 into a spare USB port on my IBM Thinkpad T40 (Archlinux), dmesg reports:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>:

					<p>Try with &quot;minicom -s&quot; and then you can edit the serial port settings (e.g set the port to /dev/ttyUSB0, speed to 115200 8N1).<br />You can either save then as default or with a name.</p><p>If you save different profiles (I have &quot;console&quot; (9600) ,&quot;wrap&quot; (38400), &quot;hspd&quot; (115200)), you can recall them directly on the command line with &quot;minicom hspd&quot;, for example.</p>									</div>
