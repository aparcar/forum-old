					<p>Good day everyone,</p><p>i want to modify the original firmware of a Teltonika Rut500, they have&nbsp; already modified openWrt for their own use. <br />Now my problem:</p><p>i want to take the original firmware binary file of the router and change for example the WebUI for my own desire and create a new firmware binary file. I already tried the firmware-mod-kit and failed. Do you know any programms or openWRT tools that can do the job?</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Baborut</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Baborut</strong> on 25 Mar 2015, 14:44)</p>

					<p>How did FMK fail? was it unable to extrac the filesystem or the image was unbootable? Afaik sometimes fmk can work with small modifications depending on the case. For example there was an image with a squashfs compressed with some other algorithm apart from lzma(i think), and it worked with fmk after a single line change for me.</p>									</div>
