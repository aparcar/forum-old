					<p>Hi,<br /> I&#039;ve installed openwrt on several rev 1.1 as described, but today I&#039;ve got rev 2.0 in my hands.</p><p> I press RESET button, plug the power on, Lock led goes on in a second, host PC (.66) says the ethernet gets carrier, but ethernet led on the 842 does not blink and does not ping on .86 , and - nothing happens, as this post is here.</p><p> I&#039;ve loaded openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr842n-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin via WEB interface, and it booted.</p><p> The strange things continued, however. I was able to install luci-and-all-the-stuff, told it to reset and theeen -<br />got a fresh [luci not installed, root password not set] OpenWRT installation.</p><p> I repeated this. The same result.</p><p> Any ideas? What I&#039;m missing? It this rev 2.0 is actually something new like 2.0000009805 [2.0 is cleary written on it] or my hands are unable to hold reset button?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dreadbit</strong> on 29 Apr 2014, 01:07)</p>
