					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR-1043nd (version: 1.8) router and I always had problems with the wifi.&nbsp; I bought this router 6 months ago, and it&#039;s firmware was 1.0 (I upgraded it to the latest one), which was more terrible than the OpenWRT. Wifi usually drops my computers when i download or upload with fluently high speed (Max download speed: 5MB/s, Max upload speed: 2.5MB/s). When the router drops down the connected computers none can reconnect to it over wireless connection, but over wired connection everything works correctly (even after the wifi drops). Is this a hardware bug or a software bug? I know people who have the same router with the same problem (but they still have the official TP-Link firmware.) It would be important to make a fix for this. I always have to unplug the router and plug in the adapter of the router, to recover the wifi, or i have to connect to it with a cable and reboot the router in the luci.</p><p>I&#039;m waiting for your answer.<br />Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Adam,</p><p>I have the V1.6 of this router and I&#039;m running Altitude Adjustment B2 and Rc1, both work 100% fine and I really put it under load.</p><p>There are no general problems with the 1043 that I know of, hardware or software.<br />Standard firmware or openwrt firmware.</p><p>I suspect your problem is not the 1043, but something else and the situation makes it look like the 1043 is to blame. Especially as you say wired works and wireless does not.</p><p>My advise is to complete a site survey, there are free apps on the web to run a complete survey, I&#039;d bet money you&#039;ll find that the channels your using on your 1043 are the same channels as all your neighbours. I bet their wifi is getting messed up too!</p><p>Silly things like that, or keeping a wireless phone near the router, that really is not a good idea.</p><p>Anyway overall point is this, please look outside the router for what could be causing this.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>It is worth doing a site survey to find that for sure, I find almost all routers use channel 6, 9 and 2 or 3 (I forget).</p><p>When I had similar problems and did a survey I found I had about 17 neighbours all using those three channels, one of which I was using also. I changed to another channel and have never had another problem.</p><p>Will it help you for sure, I don&#039;t know, but it is well worth trying.</p><p>If that doesn&#039;t help I have found dropping down a speed helps too.</p><p>From n to g or from g to b and so on until you get a steady connection.</p><p>If you still think it might be the 1043 maybe borrow a router from family/friend for a few weeks and try that, see if that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>i have the same problem here. I have one TL-1043ND and two &quot;TL-WA901ND v2&quot; running at my Network. </p><p>All three devices have the same problem. As soon there is more load on Wifi it drops dead. The network is still there but no data come thru (Wired Network runs just fine).</p><p>I testet the normal Builds on the server here and compiled also my own builds with the latest svn version for all three devices. Allways the same problem.</p><p>On my 1043 i enabled channel 14 to test this. There is no other network on this channel nearby but the problem is still there. After 10 - 30 minutes &quot;heavy&quot; WiFi load it drops and i have to reboot the router (WiFi device itself does not respond to a restart).</p><p>I have this problem now for over 5 month and i don&#039;t know what to do anymore. I think for the 901 devices i have to go back to DD-WRT. But it would be nice if i can stay with OpenWRT.</p><p>Sorry for my bad english.</p><p>bye Hausi</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hausmeister</strong> on 6 Mar 2013, 12:38)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m using wr1043nd too, uptime is several weeks now, device is heavily loaded (I transfer gigs from/to usb storage) over samba. I know there is some kind of bug with atheros and encryption tkip I have had with other devices like wr741nd, but using option encryption &#039;psk2+ccmp&#039; in /etc/config/wireless seems to solve the problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 6 Mar 2013, 17:00)</p>

					<p>I also had an 1043ND rev 1.8 and I tried all possible alternative softwares on it;<br />on heavy wireless traffic (&gt;5 MB/s) or on large file transfers , it suddenly droped !<br />the newest firmwares didn&#039;t require a reboot, the wlan connection came back after a while, but it was not acceptable as a solution!<br />I realized that is a hardware problem on certain revisions so I sold it imediatelly ;<br />strange thing is that, I have a WR941ND which has very similar hardware and wireless chip and it doesn&#039;t have this issue on ANY of it&#039;s revisions, it&#039;s rock stable - I have 12 MB/s wireless transfer on P2P with it as client (same as like on lan cable), WDR3600 being the AP</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I have understood, the problems are with AR91xx radio chipsets (AR9106 in 1043ND), especially in noisy environments and HT40. There has been a lot of work in ath9k trying to make these radios reliable, but it looks pretty difficult without input from Qualcomm. Most likely there is a hardware bug which needs to be worked around. Newer revisions of WR941ND, for example, use AR92xx, which works a lot better.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can confirm a bad behaviour of wifi too, even with psk2+ccmp. I don&#039;t know why or when this happens, but sometimes I really need to do wifi down and wifi to restart wifi. The wifi bug is on multiple models I use - wr1043nd v1.10, wr841nd v8 and wr741nd v4 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I see the wifi, but I can&#039;t login, in <strong><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43188">this thread</a></strong> is what I have captured so far. Luckily it happens not very often, at least for me, and cron reastarts seem to help. It happens on a link between two devices, where the wifi is not utilised at all and ht20 is used, I have tried recent builds of AA and BB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 15 May 2013, 23:38)</p>
