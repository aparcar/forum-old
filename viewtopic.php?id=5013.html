					<p>If anyone is interested, I&#039;ve posted some snort 2.4.4 and libmysqlclient 5.0.18 packages and libs for RC5 at <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~fidelis/openwrt/packages/">http://www.xmission.com/~fidelis/openwrt/packages/</a>.</p><p>They were built using the latest SDK but they aren&#039;t tested so who knows? they may brick your router.</p><p>Hope someone finds them useful.</p><p>BTW OpenWRT team: Thanks for all the hard work; I&#039;ve been having loads of fun for the last week and a half. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>-sojourner</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Nico.</p><p>For snort 2.4.4 the only thing I needed to do was remove all of the patches that were created for 2.3.3, change the Makefile version number and md5sm, and add a working startup script for snort and snort-wireless. I&#039;ll send you a tarball of my package/snort* folders.</p><p>-sojourner</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for posting these. I&#039;ve just been playing with your release, trying to find the right combination of rules and preprocessors which would use less memory than I had installed on my WRT54GS <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Here&#039;s what eventually settled on, after much experimentation. This is using the PR ruleset from snort.org</p><p>preprocessors:&nbsp; flow, frag3, stream4 (with memcap 1M), http_inspect, rpc_decode, bo, telnet_decode, sfportscan (with memcap 2M)</p><p>all the standard rules minus: web-*.rules, smtp, imap, pop2, pop3, nntp, other-ids</p><p>Also: config detection: search-method lowmem</p><p>I don&#039;t claim to be a snort expert, but this seems to work OK with about 20MB of memory usage.</p><p>VmSize:&nbsp; &nbsp; 21208 kB<br />VmLck:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 kB<br />VmRSS:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15624 kB<br />VmData:&nbsp; &nbsp; 19348 kB<br />VmStk:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 68 kB<br />VmExe:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;584 kB<br />VmLib:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1012 kB</p>									</div>
