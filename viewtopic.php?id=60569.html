					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have two compex WPJ558 boards with WLE900VX 802.11ac cards (2 antennas connected so 2x2 setting), and i&#039;m trying to reach the maximum throughput. </p><p>I have installed the latest OpenWRT (trunk version) on both. The setting is :<br /> - one board as (WDS) AP<br /> - the other board as (WDS too) STA<br /> - two computer connected to each board (Gigabit ethernet)<br /> - iperf (UDP) to get the speed</p><p>I get a maximum of 550 Mbps (average is about 450-500) despite a theoretical 780Mbps max (mcs 9, 2 spatial streams, 80 MHz).</p><p>With the original CompexWRT firmware on both boards, I reach 650 Mbps average.</p><p>Is there something i could do to enhance my setting, or it is simply that the compexWRT driver perform better than ath10k, and i can&#039;t do much ?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Smalth,</p><p>I am from Compex Systems. CompexWRT is using modified QCA&#039;s wireless drivers. I am not experienced with ath10K drivers but we believe that QCA&#039;s wireless drivers are more stable and have higher throughput. We are a QCA ADC (Authorized Design Center), with the ability to sublicense wireless drivers source codes. If you are interested, feel free to PM me.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Tian Yee</p>									</div>

					<p>I get around 450Mbit peak during real-world transfer to/from a Samba server using my laptop with an Intel 2x2 card connect to an Archer C7.</p><p>So I would have to agree that there seems to be some current limitations with the ath10k drivers as the speed was only about 80Mbit less using a 1x1 adapter.</p><p>That said, I do not trust iperf2 or iperf3 for benchmarking WiFi performance as it reports 300Mbit doing the TCP test and I can&#039;t get the UDP test to work reliably at all, showing anything from failed, 1Mbit or 100Mbit.</p>									</div>

					<p>maybe your spatial stream collapsed, just like the quantum slipstream in star trek <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>what chipset has this adapter and why haven&#039;t you upgraded to 3x3 card in the first place?</p>									</div>
