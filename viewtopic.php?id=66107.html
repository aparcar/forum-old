					<p>I think the SQM-QoS package will do what you want. Instead of prioritizing a particular MAC address, it gives priority to <em>all</em> traffic with low volumes over traffic with high volumes. It also ensures fairness between flows, so that all stations get fair access.</p><p>You can read about how to install it (it&#039;s easy) in all recent builds (BB, CC, DD) in the HOWTO at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I set up QosSQm but not sure I have it set up properly. It has reduced bufferbloat to &quot;A&quot; grade on DSLR speedtest but<br />it has reduced my speeds somewhat. Is this a normal result? I am not sure that I am testing it correctly.</p>									</div>

					<p>When you configure SQM-QoS, you are expected to set a max. bandwith of 85% ~ 95% of your actual bandwith; and when you do that, you are limiting your connection for &quot;normal&quot; traffic, and reserve some bandwith for &quot;priority&quot; traffic.</p>									</div>

					<p>So the critical buffering happens in front of the slowest link, the bottleneck (changes from fast to slow generally are critical).

					<p>@bauj - You can use either wired or wireless during SQM setup. (You will probably be doing the SQM setup when no one else is using the wireless (or the network at all...), so the measurements should be good. Even your wireless set up will be faster than the 5M/800K DSL link.) Follow the steps in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/sqm</a> - start with speed settings at 85%, then run a bufferbloat test, increase the speed setting a bit, test again, etc. until latency gets too high, then back off. Do this for download first, then do the upload speeds.</p><p>@moeller0 - I am starting to recommend Cmder as a replacement for putty on Windows. <a href="http://cmder.net/">http://cmder.net/</a> - see <a href="http://richb-hanover.com/cmder-for-windows-alternative-to-putty/">http://richb-hanover.com/cmder-for-wind â€¦ -to-putty/</a></p>									</div>
