					<p>Hello.</p><p>I want to create a user that would be used for establishing ssh tunnels only. Such user should not have access to any shell.</p><p>I have added a new user by modifying /etc/passwd /etc/shadow and /etc/group.</p><p>And to disable shell, I set the shell to &quot;/bin/false&quot; in /etc/passwd. When I do that, dropbear starts failing my password authentication and I get a &quot;Permission denied, please try again.&quot; from ssh client (I did use the -N switch to not try starting a shell). And dropbear logs this message: authpriv.warn dropbear[2378]: User &#039;somebody&#039; has invalid shell, rejected.</p><br /><p>Now through experimentation I discovered that if add &quot;/bin/false&quot; to /etc/shells file, then I can sucessfully authenticate to dropbear again, establishing a tunnel without a shell.</p><p>My question is whether this is the right solution? Might this introduce any problems? I googled a bit (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/base-files/+bug/295960">click </a><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/519215/what-is-the-difference-between-sbin-nologin-and-bin-false"> clack</a>) and in general the idea of putting &quot;/bin/false&quot; in /etc/shells is discouraged but never explained with any examples - what and how might break?</p><p>Thanks for any input on this matter!</p><br /><p>(Using 14.07-rc3, r42056)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pingo</strong> on 6 Sep 2014, 01:45)</p>
