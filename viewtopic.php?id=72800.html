					<p>Do all testing a controlled environment so the signal not get out of your room. Don&#039;t use it for anything illegal. Don&#039;t break your country regulations. I follow the FCC rules of my country. The reason of this is that the limitation doesn&#039;t take into consideration modifying the hardware and the antennas and licenses acquired to operate in other frequencies.</p><p>I made the patches. They been tested on lede 17.01 and openwrt 15.01 (gpio patch is needed for better signal) with cpe510 US version v1.1. In both scenario they give me the same errors.</p><p>If &quot;option country&quot; is present at /etc/config/wireless. The wireless card wont start. That means that everything needs to be configured through ssh. Anyone know what is causing this? You need to setup option &quot;hwmode 11n&quot; in ssh also.</p><p>Can&#039;t set some channel to 26dbm even its unlocked and iw phy0 info list them as possible. Probably there is a another safe lock in kernel i miss</p><p>I pasted the patches in:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>forum.lede-project.org/t/cpe510-4920-6100-26dbm-unlocked/9714?u=christianrodher</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>christianrodher</strong> on 16 Dec 2017, 14:41)</p>

So just by removing antennas and been n in a solid wall room. the signal don&#039;t get out more than a few meters. </p><p>Note: Sorry for my bad English is not my main language.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>christianrodher</strong> on 16 Dec 2017, 18:51)</p>

					<p>Hello to all, excuse my English.&nbsp; <br />Buy a tp-link CPE510 V2 (UNITED STATES), I am making an investigative work for my university, I don&#039;t seek to break the laws, it is exclusively for educational use.

If somebody knows as achieving this that explains to me, I have looked for in several formun and they tell me that it is not possible because this anchored the region in a space of storage of readonly and that you cannot change.
