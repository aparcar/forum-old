					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m running a WGT634U with 8.09.2. Samba3 is installed and works just fine. I want to make it appear in my Mac Finder. So I installed avahi-daemon. I remember running this setup in an earlier version just fine. My smb.service looks like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&#039;no&#039;?&gt;&lt;!--*-nxml-*--&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM &quot;avahi-service.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;service-group&gt;
&lt;name replace-wildcards=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;%h&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;service&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;_smb._tcp&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;port&gt;139&lt;/port&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;

&lt;service&gt;
&lt;type&gt;_device-info._tcp&lt;/type&gt;
&lt;port&gt;0&lt;/port&gt;
&lt;txt-record&gt;model=Xserve&lt;/txt-record&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/service-group&gt;</code></pre></div><p>After starting avahi-daemon it works well. It shows up in Finder and I can connect instantly. Wonderful.<br />But after a few minutes, I just can&#039;t connect any longer. After some time the icon just disappears. Connecting via &quot;smb://IP&quot; works fine, so SMB is ok.<br />When I restart avahi, the icon comes back instantly.</p><p>I also started avahi in debug- mode, but it gives me absolutely no information when this error occurs. Nor does it crash.</p><p>Please, could someone help me?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m sorry I forgot to mention something very essential:<br />I use the WGT634U as a client. My real router is a fritzbox. I use to connect one of the four LAN ports to the WAN port of the WGT. I edited /etc/config/firewall.user to allow traffic between WAN&lt;-&gt;LAN so I can connect to the WGT for example. The WGT gets it&#039;s IP from the fritzbox.<br />Now I put a computer behind the WGTs switch and it was able to see the share for all the time. From within my &quot;real&quot; network I can see the share only for about two minutes until it disappears.. But the very exact configuration worked for me with an older OpenWRT release. The only change other than that is that i replaced the 7170 by a 7270.</p><br /><br /><p>//Edit:<br />Forget everything i wrote previously <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I&#039;m sorry for causing some confusion, but it seems like the the Fritzbox causes all the trouble. After I restarted the Fritzbox, it seems to work fine again. Actually I restarted the box because of a USB problem. It&#039;s absolutely essential to plug the power cord and wait a few minutes. Otherwise the box&#039;s USB device wouldn&#039;t be recognised too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wb</strong> on 8 Feb 2010, 01:18)</p>
