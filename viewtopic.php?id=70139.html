					<p>Hi all, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m posting in the correct area but wasn&#039;t sure where to start.</p><p>I&#039;ll try and keep the background info brief, I&#039;m using a TP-link MR3020 as a local wifi access point into an Ethernet enabled device (PLC) for diagnostic purposes, fault display, error logging and so on using your smartphone as the screen. In this mode there is no internet available.</p><p>This TP-link router can be switch using the slider switch to &#039;guest&#039; mode (WISP) which then connects to a predefined SSID and passphrase, in this mode the router gains internet access from the wifi hotspot (most likely the same smartphone hotspot). The router then initiates an OpenVPN connection back to a server, at this point direct remote access can be gained to the Ethernet device, at which point anything can get be changed or updated as if local to the device, using routing tables and so on.</p><p>The above process seems to work ok, BUT with the acceptation that each smartphones SSID and pass must be changed to match the predefined one as stated above. This is a bit of a pain with some smartphones.</p><p>What I want to try to implement is a custom Luci page showing only the SSID and passphrase text fields that can be changed to suit the new users phones SSID and pass. These changes would have to be carried out with the router in AP mode, so it would be a different wireless config file than the one that would be running. Also after every reboot the router would return to either AP mode or &#039;guest&#039; mode (depending on slider) with predefined SSID.</p><p>Is it even possible to change a config file that is not currently running? How do you make a custom page with only two text fields and submit button? Also I build my firmware images using ImageGenerator (ImageBuilder) so the custom page might have to be copied from /etc folder to /luci folder, maybe...</p><p>Any help would be awesome, the CBI or View (Template) seems to required a different way to compile the firmware other than ImageGenerator, which I&#039;m not familiar with.</p><p>Thanks heaps,</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t need to compile model/cbi files at all, you can include them (as well as a controller file) as files with the image builder. They go into directories under /usr/lib/lua/luci/.</p><p>Luci API page + code from existing wireless config page (I believe it&#039;s under system_network somewhere) should help you. I&#039;m not a programmer and I&#039;ve done something similar in the past.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your suggestions Stangri, I&#039;m already including files into my image like /etc/config/, I didn&#039;t realise you could include other things like /usr/lib/lua/luci. i&#039;ll do that thanks.</p><p>You wouldn&#039;t know how to install the development environment into say Ubuntu so I can test different code examples without having to flash the firmware into the target device for every change?</p><p>you wouldn&#039;t have an example I could follow by any chance?</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks everyone for there suggestions, with all the info I have managed to find a solution that allows me to extract the two required fields and place them in f:field(Value,.,.,.) CBI objects.</p><p>To do this I first read the file and search for required field for example &#039;ssid&#039;, see below example (experimental code hack)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>function read_field(strobject, length)
        data = tostring(fs.readfile(hotspotfile))
        start = data:find(&quot;option &quot; .. strobject,1) + 9 + length
        ends = data:find(&quot;&#039;&quot;, start) - 1
        return data:sub(start,ends)
end</code></pre></div><p>You call this function when you want something out of the file like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>function ssid.cfgvalue()
        return read_field(&quot;ssid&quot;, 4)  -- note the 4 is the length of the string
end</code></pre></div><p>(Question, how do you determine the length of a string? What&#039;s the syntax?)</p><p>The write event looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>function ssid.write(self, section, value)
        Value.write(self,section, value)
        data = tostring(fs.readfile(hotspotfile))
        foundtext = read_field(&quot;ssid&quot;, 4)
        data = data:gsub(foundtext, value)
        fs.writefile(hotspotfile, data:gsub(&quot;\r\n&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;))
end</code></pre></div><p>The gsub is the key here, it substitutes the text found in the file with the text from value field.</p><p>Again thanks everyone and hope it might help someone else, maybe...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zonared</strong> on 22 Mar 2017, 04:56)</p>

					<p>You&#039;re welcome to continue on the path you&#039;ve started already, but if I were you, I&#039;d:<br />1. Create a CBI file with map to WiFi config letting user edit STA WiFi interface with the disabled default state.<br />2. On a slider switch -- enable/disable STA interface.<br />3. On boot up -- disable/enable STA interface based on the slider position.</p><p>Even at my very modest skill level it&#039;s a single day job at most.</p><p>Post your e-mail and I can send you the code I&#039;ve mentioned in my first reply in this thread.</p>									</div>
