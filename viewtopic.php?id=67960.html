					<p>Hi guys,</p><p> I have been dabbling with wifidog &amp; mwan3 . Sometimes a few people start to mention that internet has stopped working for them. I know that wifidog plays around with iptable rules &amp; mwan3 with both iptables, networking rules &amp; routes. </p><p> Is there a way to log packet that generate from the lan, destined for the outside world &amp; eventually dint make it (may be dint find right route or probably got dropped/rejected by iptable rule).</p>									</div>
