					<p>It is usually useless to increase tx power on the router if you cannot increase the tx power on the client too, because the connection is bidirectional.<br />You can use an antenna with bigger gain to improve signal quality, up to the limit imposed in your country.<br />Avoid obstacles between the router and the client. Go through walls in a 90 degree angle, the flatter the angle is, the thicker the wall will be for the wireless signal.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have helped several of my friends to build an indoor network in, usually a 3-story townhouse which is very big, and of course contains lots of walls(don&#039;t think I am a professional network administrator, I just helped my friends with some personal opinions:) )</p><p>I guess the simplest solution might be using several APs in your house. If the repeaters are too expensive, then perhaps your could buy several used cheap routers and use cable to connect them to the main router in your house. You may have to set up several subnets, which is easier than the repeater I guess. I think wall is not a big problem---the floor is. Of course you could use big antenna for router and clients, but sometimes it is not that easy because, for if you use a notebook with internal antenna which is not practical to be replaced.</p>									</div>

Unfortunately aesthetics often dictate hiding the WAP at the edges or inside something (like a stereo cabinet). In most of the apartments I&#039;ve lived in (400sqft or less) it won&#039;t matter where you put it with the normal settings. With lower power you might have some difficulties with the furthest reach.</p><p>A &#039;better&#039; antenna often just changes the signal dispersion pattern. The normal 3db antenna is much more omni (all directions, more blimp like with less going up and down and more going horizontal), the 6db are a bit flatter (like putting a book on the blimp, even less up and down, more horizontal). If things are on different levels then a 3db might be better, if everything is on the same floor level then a 6db won&#039;t hurt things. As the other poster mentioned, in a 3 story town home multiple WAPs are needed as the signal pattern of the 3db won&#039;t give good coverage of the upper or lower floors (assuming the WAP is on the second level).</p><p>I&#039;m not sure about the direction antenna, you need to know which type to get and sometimes its a science. An antenna meant for long distance have a very narrow pattern and won&#039;t have much (or any) strength if off center. I&#039;m certain there is an antenna design that can give 180, 90, 60, 45 or even 30 degree coverage.&nbsp; I&#039;m just not so sure it&#039;s needed for your average apartment (where a 3db gives more than adequate coverage).</p>									</div>
