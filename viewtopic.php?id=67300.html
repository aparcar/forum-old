					<p><strong>What I would like to do:</strong><br />I want to set up a router to serve it&#039;s own DHCP for its own network, but also join an existing wireless network (no CAT5) to get internet.&nbsp; </p><p>Router A is at 192.168.1.1, has internet, and assume I have no admin access (its just a simple dummy AP)</p><p>Router B is at 192.168.2.1, uses OpenWRT, Atheros chipset, and manages a local network that has no internet, <em>yet</em>.</p><p>Router B must operate standalone, AND have the added benefit of internet if/when Router A is accessible.</p><p><strong>What I did:</strong><br />With Router B on a clean OpenWRT with default settings (but LAN on 192.168.2.x, etc), I took it and (i think) joined the Router A AP as a client to get internet. This created its own new WAN interface, I did NOT attach this to the existing LAN.&nbsp; I then created a new Wireless network in AP mode with DHCP enabled and attached it to the LAN (192.168.2.x).</p><p>The result is <em>ALMOST</em> exactly what I want.&nbsp; Clients of Router B can join with a 2.x address and see each other AND internet.&nbsp; HOWEVER, <span style="color: Red">this is the problem</span>:&nbsp; if Router A is out of range when B is turned on, no SSID appears, and my clients cannot see or join Router B!&nbsp; It&#039;s as if the whole thing falls apart when it can&#039;t join A.&nbsp; Lame.&nbsp; <strong>I want it to function fine but without internet when Router A is not available</strong>.</p><p>Questions:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Anyone know why my OpenWRT router B throws a fit and doesn&#039;t work, just because it can&#039;t find A?</p></li><li><p>What is the appropriate <strong>mode</strong> for the scenario I described?&nbsp; <strong>Repeater</strong>?&nbsp; Or is it a <strong>Routed Client Masqueraded</strong>?, or what?</p></li><li><p>Can I configure this through <strong>Luci</strong>?&nbsp; (that is all I have used so far, I&#039;m not a script guru)</p></li></ul>									</div>
