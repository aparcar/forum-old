					<p>Hello all.&nbsp; This is my first post.&nbsp; So here is what I am looking to do with the 2640B.&nbsp; I am looking to use the WiFi NIC in the router to bridge to another WiFi access point (essentially turning the WiFi NIC into a WAN connection).&nbsp; I then intend to run NAT on the router and extend off the 4 LAN ports to connect Ethernet devices to do it.</p><p>By default the device won&#039;t do this with factory firmware.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for some information about how to get OpenWRT onto this unit so I can accomplish my goal.&nbsp; This my first dealings with OpenWRT so please forgive me if I&#039;m asking dumb questions.&nbsp; &nbsp;From the best I can determine I need to have console access to the unit to accomplish this.&nbsp; Basically per post #2 of what I found here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33146">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33146</a> .&nbsp; &nbsp; From what I am gathering I need some sort of USB to serial converter for an older cell phone or some special make box to accomplish this connection.&nbsp; </p><p>Does anybody have any particulars on what parts and pieces are needed to with with this unit?&nbsp; I realize it&#039;s not a standard RS232 type connection so some advice would be appreciated.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to get it going this weekend so some common off the shelf type stuff would be nice.&nbsp; I have a 9 pin Serial port on my laptop so I can work with a USB only or a serial only solution.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks a bunch for your help guys.</p><p>Jason</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, I wanted to give a further update.&nbsp; I have been unable to flash this unit yet.&nbsp; Long story short I opened the unit up and checked the console port prior to ever hooking any cables to it and found something interesting.&nbsp; The 6 pin connector that in the one writeup indicates it is a console, I&#039;m not so sure now that is the case with these, but looking for help.&nbsp; Basically one whole row of pins is a ground, and the other row of 3 pins is 3.3 volts.&nbsp; Basically this connector</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i640.photobucket.com/albums/uu122/jayss10/31CE21EB-04E8-4E1F-BEE4-231EA50E0532-1123-00000153539738D5_zps679e0f6e.jpg" alt="http://i640.photobucket.com/albums/uu122/jayss10/31CE21EB-04E8-4E1F-BEE4-231EA50E0532-1123-00000153539738D5_zps679e0f6e.jpg" /></span></p><p>I did some further poking and found that the 8 pin connector on the board is not pinned out like others described it as well.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have the particulars in front of me at the moment, but I know the ground and the voltages were in different places (perhaps this is the console on this board)?&nbsp; Here is him.&nbsp; </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i640.photobucket.com/albums/uu122/jayss10/B13C6CF5-8656-4989-A33B-4E7A4D8982B0-1123-0000015346AE54CF_zpsc048c739.jpg" alt="http://i640.photobucket.com/albums/uu122/jayss10/B13C6CF5-8656-4989-A33B-4E7A4D8982B0-1123-0000015346AE54CF_zpsc048c739.jpg" /></span></p><p>Just confirm for me that this is a good way to go about finding the console port on these routers.&nbsp; There is nothing else that screams at me &quot;I&#039;m the console port look at me&quot;.&nbsp; If anybody has any suggestions please by all means offer them up.&nbsp; This is kinda the guide I&#039;ve used to confirm what I think I know, but we all know that some of the things on youtube has to be taken with a grain of salt.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pumxmUyfuI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pumxmUyfuI</a>&nbsp; Thanks a million for your help guys.</p><p>Jason</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kossuth</strong> on 28 Feb 2013, 06:48)</p>

					<p>You should give that 6 pin connector another try. See if you can find a 3.3V test point on the board (normally labeled something like &quot;3V3&quot;) and do some resistance tests against the pins on that connector. The ones with around 0 ohms are most likely real 3.3V pins, so they should not be connected. Then just connect Rx and GND of your serial cable to the remaining pins and look for some output on your terminal program. If that works, you can even connect your serial cables Tx.</p>									</div>
