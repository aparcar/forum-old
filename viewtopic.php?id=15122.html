					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am interested in router JTAG development, my question is, where do you start from? To put it into perspective...</p><p>Say i have an ADSL router with a MIPS processor and i wish to determine the DEVICE ID. Now i have code which allows me to communicate with a parallel port etc and have a router with accessible JTAG TAP pins. What im stuck on is, what specific code do i use to acquire the ID of the device?</p><p>I see there is a lot of open source code specifically stuff like hairydairymaid which allows a CPU probe/detect etc but where and how was this code taken from? Where are people getting the specific bit streams to transmit data over the TMS/TDI/TCK pins???</p><p>Any help to start me of would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>
