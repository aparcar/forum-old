					<p>hello,<br />I managed all my previous problems, and currently running OpenWRT on a Netgear 3500L. I&#039;m really satisfied about this!<br />But there is a problem. I made an extrootfs, via a 4-port USB adapter. I put on this adapter a flash drive, and 2 autopowered USB hard drives, both formatted in NTFS.<br />Well: transferring files between those two disks or among them and any other disk in the LAN is very slow. I constantly get 1-1.5 MB/s or less (sometimes as low as 750KB/s), and network link doesn&#039;t make any difference( to be clearer, I run my LAN via powerline adapters, but that is not the issue: my main PC is directly linked to the router, and transfer figures are the same). I tried out three different USB hubs, but performance stays about the same for all.<br />What can be the culprit? What can I try?<br />Thanks,<br />Stargate64</p>									</div>

					<p>NTFS is very slow under linux and tends to be CPU intensive, so this is a major problem for slower CPUs like we have in our routers. Your best bet is to switch the format of the drives to a linux-native format, like ext3.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 1 Dec 2014, 06:08)</p>

					<p>Thank you very much! Actually, I noticed the CPU load imposed by nygfs-3g...<br />I&#039;ll give your suggestion a try!<br />Stargate64</p>									</div>
