					<p>Hi!</p><p>I continue with my &quot;opened only what i want&quot; firewall. I&#039;ve make it as i want, restricting access to the router only from the wired laptop. A simplified version of it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config defaults
    option input    REJECT
    option output    REJECT 
    option forward    REJECT

config zone
    option name    lan
    option input    REJECT 
    option output    ACCEPT 
    option forward    REJECT

config rule
    option name        &#039;Allow DHCP request&#039;
    option src        lan
    option src_port    &#039;67-68&#039;
    option dest_port    &#039;67-68&#039;
    option proto    udp
    option target    ACCEPT

config rule
    option name        &#039;access to the router from wired laptop&#039;
    option src        lan
    option src_mac    XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    option dest_ip    192.168.2.1
   option dest_port    22
    option proto         tcp
    option target    ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>As in lan zone INPUT is set to REJECT, i supossed that a new rule was necesary no acces to the server from the laptop. Both in lan. A rule like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
    option name        &#039;Allow connect Server ssh from laptop&#039;
    option src        lan
    option src_ip    192.168.2.101
    option dest_ip    192.168.2.100
    option dest_port    22
    option proto    tcp
    option target    ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>But it doesn&#039;t work. The rule is not necesary, and every device in lan can ssh to the server. As i have read, as lan zone is bridged, the firewall is &quot;disabled&quot;.</p><p>In the netfiler Howto (openwrt), it says:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Note1: In OpenWrt bridge firewalling is disabled by default. It can be enabled by editing /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1</code></pre></div><p>I found this too (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10899">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10899</a>)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...to get iptables bridging working in OpenWrt...

Recompiling the OpenWrt image with CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=y set in the Linux kernel is the first of two steps in enabling iptables&#039; bridging mode in OpenWrt. The second step is either to delete the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or set each of them to “1” rather than “0”:

net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0</code></pre></div><p>Except recompiling the kernel, i&#039;ve tried both solutions (making &#039;sysctl -p&#039; after changes), but it seems doesn&#039;t work. Perhaps i made something wrong, i&#039;ll try it again.</p><p>But, what i&#039;d like to know is if this solutions are for i want (restrict acces to a lan device from the same bridged interface), or, apart from them, i must change the switch section in /etc/network... or play with the interface section and its devices ¿?</p><p>Any help?</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Bridge firewalling is only going to match traffic that is routed, i.e. from one device on the LAN to another device on the LAN, so I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s related to your issue.</p><p>Instead of filtering based on MAC addresses:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option src_mac    XX:XX:XX:XX:XX</code></pre></div><p>try filtering on IP to see if that works first:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule

					<p>Thanks jdg99! but i think i explained bad.</p><p>With the below configuration, accesing the router only by wired connection from lan is ok. That&#039;s why i use mac. From the same device, connected via wifi, i can&#039;t acces the router. that&#039;s what i wanted.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config defaults

    option src        lan
    option src_port    &#039;67-68&#039;

   option dest_port    22
    option proto         tcp
    option target    ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>But, i thought that with the above config, i couldn&#039;t access from one lan device to another lan device. So, i thought that i must create a rule similar to this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
    option name        &#039;Allow connect Server ssh from laptop&#039;
    option src        lan

    option dest_ip    192.168.2.100
    option dest_port    22
    option proto    tcp
    option target    ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>But that rule, wasn&#039;t neccesary, as without it, i can access from a lan device to another lan device. And that isn&#039;t the behaviour i want, as i want to control what device can access to another lan device.</p><p>The reason seems to be because my interface is bridged and &quot;in OpenWrt bridge firewalling is disabled by default&quot;.</p><p>Yo say:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jdg99 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>...Bridge firewalling is only going to match traffic that is routed, i.e. from one device on the LAN to another device on the LAN...</p></blockquote></div><p>that&#039;s important because now i know that i must &quot;activate&quot; bridge firewalling.</p><p>I&#039;ll keep investigating a bit more and making probes about that.</p><p>Thanks again jdg99</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, awesome, I understand.<br />You shouldn&#039;t need those two packages either.</p><p>Try inserting the following rule on the command line, this will let you see if you are actually facing the same bug as me:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i br-lan -o br-lan -j LOG --log-prefix &quot;bridged traffic&quot;</code></pre></div><p>and then run a<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>logread -f |grep &quot;bridged traffic&quot;</code></pre></div><p>and generate some traffic between two LAN devices.</p><p>If you see a log entry pop up with the phrase &quot;bridged traffic&quot;, then everything is working fine on your router, if not, the firewall can&#039;t see bridged traffic.<br />This is the issue I ran into and the only way I solved it was by downgrading to 14.07.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi jdg99!</p><p>i made what you said. Some like this appears; it says &quot;bridged traffic&quot;:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Well, after the notes above, i&#039;ve managed to get it working.</p><p>When i said &quot;net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1&quot; didn&#039;t work... well, i&#039;ll say:</p><p>- LAN bridge puts &quot;wlan and eth0&quot; together (sorry, i&#039;m not at home, and the names aren&#039;t exact.<br />- &quot;net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1&quot; it works, without installing ebtables<br />- As lan firewall forward is set to REJECT, it works, i can&#039;t ssh to the wired server from any wifi device. If i create a rule in the firewall to allow it, i can.<br />- But, it seems that the 3 ports of the eth0 are &quot;bridged into a bridge&quot;. So, if i ssh to the wired server from a wired device, i can do it, althought in the firewall isn&#039;t allowed. For me, isn&#039;t a real problem, as all the devices are wifi, except the server, so i can control who or what can be done.</p><p>The last point is why i said &quot;net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1&quot; didn&#039;t work:&nbsp; i was connected with the wire, and ssh&#039;ed to the wired server.</p><p>I suppose that to solve the eth0 &quot;bridged into a bridge&quot; i must configure the switch... but this is too much for me, and i don&#039;t really need it.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
