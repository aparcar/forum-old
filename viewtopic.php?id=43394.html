					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT. I installed Attitude Adjustment RC1 on my TPLINK TL-WR841N v8.4 with ease. However, i didnt get Luci with the instalation. Nevermind, I followed the instruction, was able to set interent connection through vi editor and /etc/config/network.</p><p>After that I wanted to install Luci with this set of commands:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>opkg update<br />opkg install luci</p></blockquote></div><p>as is described in OpenWRT documentation section.</p><p>Despite my great effort, when I execute any of these two commands nothing happens. In the (PuTTY) console only one new completely empty line appears with green rectangle in its beginning. In this empty line I can write anything but with no effect.</p><p>I also tried &quot;grep luci&quot; command with exactly same conclusion as described above.</p><p>Do I miss something obvious? Thank you for help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Boss is right, except he wanted to say BB is <strong>newer</strong> than AA <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Attitude Aadjustment is an ancestor of Barrier Breaker, but some builds of BB might be unstable, or not working at all, but if you like to play, you may want to give BB a try (with a risk of bricking your router, but I haven&#039;t a single problem with replacement here in CZ).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 15 May 2013, 14:39)</p>
