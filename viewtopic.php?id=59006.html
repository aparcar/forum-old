					<p>Hello,</p><p>first, sorry for my english!</p><p>I decided to buy a new router for my private network. I made a litte image, its on german but I hope you can understand it.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150812/p6pqcogn.png" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>Client 1 goes through a normal router and a modem to the internet. For client 2 i want to buy a OpenWrt based router (of cause ill flash it myself) which has the task to use only OpenVPN to go into the internet. If the VPN-Server fails, there should be no connection. </p><p>A couple days ago i bougt a TP-Link WR841N, which didn&#039;t work. The flash memory was too little for the OpenVPN plugin.</p><p>What kind of router can you recommend to me? The price should be about 30-50$. Do you know a good tutorial for my purposes? (how i need to configurate the plugin etc.)</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TheUnit</strong> on 13 Aug 2015, 09:28)</p>

					<p>Over the last year I have gone from a Linksys WRT-54GS to Buffalo WZR-HP-G300H to a PC-Engines ALIX for my home OpenVPN server.&nbsp; I had started with DD-WRT and eventually moved to OpenWRT.&nbsp; Performance more or less doubled each time to somewhere around 10 Mbps with 128-AES encryption.&nbsp; </p><p>Bottom line is you want as much CPU and memory as you can get.&nbsp; </p><p>I am running a HooToo TM02 travel router as a client and get about 3-4Mbps down and 1-2 up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think this would make a better solution <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gl-inet/gl-inet">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/gl-inet/gl-inet</a> (6416a) as the CPU is 1.5 times as fast and RAM/Flash double the HooToo.&nbsp; About $25 US from China. There are at least 2 others who have recently ordered this and you can search the forum for same.&nbsp; I do not think either has received them, and not sure if they plan to use this for VPN.&nbsp; It is intended as a travel router, but has 2 ethernet.&nbsp; If you need it for business security and not for media streaming it might be fine.&nbsp; The HooToo is marginal with Youtube at high quality.</p><p>It you need a robust VPN you want a CPU with AES built in the chip.&nbsp; There are almost no consumer routers with this, and you can repurpose a PC with x86 or x86/64 but may need to build your own firmware.</p><p>I am not a good teacher for the configuration, but most of my config was based upon &quot;Frog is Wrong&quot; <a href="http://www.frogiswrong.com/blog/articles/8/openvpn-on-openwrt-a-little-more-detail">http://www.frogiswrong.com/blog/article â€¦ ore-detail</a> and other OpenWRT tutorials.</p>									</div>
