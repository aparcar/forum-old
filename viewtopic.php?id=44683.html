					<p><strong>Nevermind, I can&#039;t believe it was just a matter of setting the gateway to the Thomson box IP (192.168.1.254) and not the TPLink/OpenWrt box. Makes sense. Sorry for wasting your time, but I actually did my homework before posting. I&#039;ve been searching for almost a week now, but somehow I didn&#039;t try this exact configuration, which was the proper one. <span class="bbu">Please ignore</span> this message.</strong></p><p><strong>So, OpenWrt as static, with the cable modem IP as gateway. OpenWrt IP in the cable modem DMZ configuration. That&#039;s it.</strong></p><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m running Attitude Adjustment (the last one, RC2 IIRC) on a TP-Link WR1043ND. My cable modem is a Thomson DWG874. I&#039;ve been using OpenWrt for years now, but only with DSL/PPPoE, so please blame me if I&#039;m asking/doing something stupid.</p><p>My goal is:</p><p>1) Leave the Thomson box as dumb/transparent as possible<br />2) Leave all the network tasks to the OpenWrt/TP-Link router.<br />3) Avoid double-nat<br />4) Redirect a few ports to some computers behind, in the LAN.</p><p>Physically, everything is like this:</p><p>Internet -&gt; Thomson (192.168.1.254/24) -&gt; WR1043ND (192.168.0.254/24) -&gt; computers (192.168.0.x/24)</p><p>The only configuration I could use that allows all of this is OpenWrt as DHCP, and with its IP address as a DMZ host in the Thomson configuration. However, not always the Thomson router will assign the same IP to OpenWrt (since it&#039;s DHCP), so the IP I put in DMZ may change, breaking the port redirection.</p><p>Ideally, I could put OpenWrt WAN as an static IP, and this static IP as DMZ in the Thomson, but no matter what I do, I can&#039;t get Internet access. Even when I configure the static IP as the same IP the router was just using with DHCP.</p><p>So, what do I need to achieve port forwarding without a double NAT in this case? How to configure a WAN with static IP in this case? Is DHCP more than just &quot;automatic IP assignment&quot;? I thought it was strange that I lost Internet access even though static IP had the same IP given by DHCP.</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidcs</strong> on 12 Jun 2013, 09:39)</p>
