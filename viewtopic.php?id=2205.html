					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve already post&nbsp; few weeks ago for that.</p><p>In fact, I&#039;d like to make a system of private/public key between my openwrt and debian on a compuler linux.</p><p>I&#039;d like that from my openwrt, if I do:<br />ssh thierry@private_ip__of_debian</p><p>he loggs to ssh server of debian without asking me a password.</p><p>I tried to generate keygen with ssh-keygen, but there is&#039;nt this command in openwrt even with client openssh installed:</p><p>oot@OpenWrt:~# ipkg list_installed|grep &quot;ssh&quot;<br />openssh-client - 4.0p1-1 - OpenSSH client<br />openssh-client-utils - 4.0p1-1 - OpenSSH client utilities</p><p>So after if I manage to generate a pair of key from openwrt, I will have to copy the public key to my debian, and it will work I think.</p><p>I precise that I want to connect from openwrt to my debian, and not in the other side...</p><p>I use the default ssh server of openwrt which is dropbear.</p><p>I can keep it to do that? Or it&#039;s recommend to install openssh server instead of dropbear?</p><p>And if I have to do that, is it simple in case of problem, to reinstall dropbear with my initial configuration?</p><p>Thanks a lot :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Um... I&#039;m not exactly sure about this one, but I think you could generate the keypair on your deb box and copy the <em>private</em> key to your wrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>The following from the Dropbear README file might help you:</p><br /><p>Server public key auth:</p><p>You can use ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in the same way as with OpenSSH, just put<br />the key entries in that file. They should be of the form:</p><p>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAwVa6M6cGVmUcLl2cFzkxEoJd06Ub4bVDsYrWvXhvUV+ZAM9uGuewZBDoAqNKJxoIn0Hyd0Nk/yU99UVv6NWV/5YSHtnf35LKds56j7cuzoQpFIdjNwdxAN0PCET/MG8qyskG/2IE2DPNIaJ3Wy+Ws4IZEgdJgPlTYUBWWtCWOGc= someone@hostname</p><p>You must make sure that ~/.ssh, and the key file, are only writable by the<br />user.</p><p>NOTE: Dropbear ignores authorized_keys options such as those described in the<br />OpenSSH sshd manpage, and will not allow a login for these keys.</p><p>============================================================================</p><p>Client public key auth:</p><p>Dropbear can do public key auth as a client, but you will have to convert<br />OpenSSH style keys to Dropbear format, or use dropbearkey to create them.</p><p>If you have an OpenSSH-style private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you need to do:</p><p>dropbearconvert openssh dropbear ~/.ssh/id_rsa&nbsp; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.db<br />dbclient -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.db &lt;hostname&gt;</p><p>Currently encrypted keys aren&#039;t supported, neither is agent forwarding. At some<br />stage both hopefully will be.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello</p><p>I had the same problem acessing the Openwrt from a Netbsd box with a pulic key.</p><p>When using Dropbear as server with public keys, dropbear checks if $HOME, $HOME/.ssh <br />and $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys are not writable by the group or others, the problem is<br />directory /tmp (home for root) is 0777 because it should be writable by dnsmasq (running<br />as nobody).</p><p>Solving the problem :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Change $HOME for root in /etc/passwd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; or<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Patch svr-authpubkey.c (lines 284-286)</p><p>I don&#039;t know what is the better solution, i&#039;m trying the second (in RC3)</p><p>Marc</p>									</div>
