					<p>Everything is in the title: I want to know whether the router WRT54GS v1.1 is working with Backfire.<br />This <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">page</a> states that Backfire work with the 2.0 version of the WRT54GS but I wanted to know whether this compatibility was extensible to my 1.1 version.</p><p>This <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/linksys/wrt54gs">page</a> seems to indicate every version until (and including) 4.0 is compatible with OpenWRT releases (at least White Russian and Kamikaze).<br />My supposition is that this compatibility extends to Backfire, but I would like to have a confirmation.</p><p>Thanks in advance for your time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohanMazel</strong> on 16 Aug 2010, 15:18)</p>

					<p>I have my Linksys WRT54GS v3 flashed with a self-built OpenWRT Development firmware and it works as expected. I can&#039;t say about the WiFi because I don&#039;t have a need to use WiFi nor have its WiFi enabled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, I don&#039;t really care about the WiFi.<br />My concern is much more linked to the actual compatibility of Backfire with the version 1.1.</p><p>Do you have any reason to use a compiled version of OpenWRT ? Is it linked to the inclusion of some mods ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so this is really linked to some modifications of your own. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Thanks for the answers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohanMazel</strong> on 16 Aug 2010, 17:00)</p>
