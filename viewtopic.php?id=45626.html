					<p>I understand they need upnp enabled. I did install the miniupnp daemon, and I believe I configured it correctly but I&#039;m still not able to get my devices and my chromecast talking on my network. </p><p>I&#039;ve been messing with different configs and such for a few days now but can&#039;t really seem to get upnp working on this thing. Anyone happen to have any advice? Anyone else successfully get a chromecast working with openWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not even trying to cast a tab I can&#039;t even complete the initial setup. I know that it requires functional UPnP and I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s the snag that I&#039;m hitting here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I&#039;ve tried setting it up from a few different android devices as well as from my macbook but nothing seems to work and I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s due to some kind of UPnP mis-configuration on my router.</p>									</div>

					<p>try disabling your firewall completely just for test. Chromecast replies to a UDP broadcast message from your machine, and this wont pass through a good firewall.

					<p>Yeah. Chromecast wasn&#039;t able to connect into OpenWrt, but I also installed miniupnpd and after disabling firewall it connected just fine. <br />When you disable fireawall, you&#039;ll lose internet. So after the Chromecast was connected to OpenWrt, I enabled the firewall again and now it works just fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have openwrt 15.05.1 with the most basic set up, Wan interface and bridged wired and wireless interface for the LAN.</p><p>I can cast from any device connected to the wireless interface but my wired PC doesn&#039;t detect the chromecast and therefor cannot cast. It seems that the discovery protocol cannot complete when it is initiated on a wired device.</p><p>Following this troubleshooting <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/discovery">guide</a> I could establish the following :</p><p>- Wired PC can ping and scan ports on chromecast<br />- Wired PC can ping these 3 multicast address 224.0.0.1, 239.255.255.250 and 224.0.0.251<br />- Another device on the wireless network can ping the chromecast and the wired PC<br />- Another device on the wireless network <strong>cannot ping the 3 multicast address</strong>.</p><p>From there, I searched for features, options or variables that could influence this behavior but didn&#039;t find anything.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for feedback on this kind of set up or any idea on how to unblock the discovery protocol.</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
