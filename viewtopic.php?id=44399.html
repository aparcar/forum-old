					<p>i see some guys just use a inside pcb conver micro usb to ttl inside route,i think that&#039;s pretty cool,so i wana design some smaller board to doing that,but if i just make few board,it&#039;s kind cost,so i think why i make a preorder so i can make some more pcs to the board.</p><p>so here is what i think:<br />* a small board,just covert micro usb to ttl,and a 3.3v power supply.<br />* it&#039;s very small ,just fit like the chip of ft232<br />* it&#039;s with a smt tiny switch,you can switch off the ttl function,in case you dont wana it.<br />* with a small led...i think it not need..yeah,maybe dont need it,but i wana use it to show the function is work..when switch off,it off too..</p><p>there a lot board use pl2302,it&#039;s more chip,but i wana use ft232,it&#039;s dont because change the usb port so change the com port.</p><br /><p>so my think is the preorder of this board is 4.8us for one pcs,just for the preorde.</p><p>and the roadmap is:<br />2013-5-28 start design the pcb<br />2013-6-8 stop preorder<br />2013-6-9 start make pcb,and buy the chip<br />2013-6-20 start shiper the pcb we make</p><p>i dont if it&#039;s a good idea,or a bad idea...but i think put it in some route,is cool,like wr703,so we dont need a specal cable any more.</p><p>so i put it to the ebay sore,here is it.<br /><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/171048044328">http://www.ebay.com/itm/171048044328</a></p><p>for now,this my sketch for what i thought:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://see.sl088.com/w/images/7/79/FT232-mini-board-sketchA2.png" alt="http://see.sl088.com/w/images/7/79/FT232-mini-board-sketchA2.png" /></span></p><p>i think this the five hardware we design</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slboat</strong> on 28 May 2013, 20:39)</p>
