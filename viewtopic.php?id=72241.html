					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I played with OpenWRT few years ago, almost 10, with a lynksys but never any after.</p><p>At the moment I&#039;m trying to improve the security in my home network and I&#039;m looking for new HW too if it make sense for the use.</p><p>At the moment I have a modem and the netgear WRN1000v3. THe modem is an old one but still keeping up with the connections. Unfortunately the firmware is bad and doesn&#039;t allow port forwarding or changing defaults port. For this reason I instead use the Netgear router which through the modem allow me to connect to the ISP. In other terms I set up my credentials on the router netgear which via the WAN port and the router connects to the ISP.</p><p>First question: Is this feature also available in the Openwrt dedicated to the WRN1000v3?</p><p>If not who can suggest me a decent router where I can install OpenWRT? I&#039;ll be happy if asked to open a new post about modems selection.</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>either the modem and the router netgear are a out of date and I&#039;m considering on update the system also for security reason due to a public server I run at home</p><p>beside the server which has not big visits, the system is at home with a scarce usage on wifi and some over ethernet.</p><p>I can consider update just the modem now or going for a modem/router. I&#039;d like to flash it with Openwrt or Lete as above also mentioned.</p><p>has any of u a modem to recommend? Let say price between 50 and 85 but can be increased for good resons</p><p>any modem router to recommend with price around 100/150?</p><p>cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gipsea</strong> on 6 Oct 2017, 07:29)</p>
