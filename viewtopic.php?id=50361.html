					<p>Now I think I&#039;m beginning to understand what the problem was.&nbsp; You were very helpful when you told me to look in &quot;Network Connections&quot; in control panel.&nbsp; All of my devices were disabled, including &quot;Local Area Connection&quot;.&nbsp; So I enabled all of the devices and then plugged in an ethernet cable from my router to the ethernet jack on the back of the computer.&nbsp; After doing this, Ping was able to get a response.&nbsp; Also, when I type &quot;ipconfig&quot; at the command prompt I get the following:</p><p>Windows IP Configuration</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:</p><br /><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Connection-specific DNS Suffix&nbsp; . : lan</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.135</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1</p><br /><br /><p>Ethernet adapter Wireless Network Connection:</p><br /><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Media State . . . . . . . . . . . : Media disconnected</p><br /><p>So it seems as if my router is now able to connect to my computer, but it has to connect via the ethernet cable, not wirelessly.&nbsp; So now, I&#039;m assuming I can proceed setting things up through the ethernet cable which, when I&#039;m finished, should also allow me to connect wirelessly.</p><p>If I right-click on the &quot;Wireless Network Connection&quot; icon in the &quot;Network Connections&quot; portion of Control Panel, and then click &quot;view available networks&quot;, many networks show up.&nbsp; However, because I just installed the firmware on my router, and haven&#039;t begun to set things up, I&#039;m assuming that my wireless network wouldn&#039;t show up here.&nbsp; Even if it was showing up, I don&#039;t know what it would be called.&nbsp; Hopefully, after I go through the basic configuration process, it will show up.&nbsp; Please let me know if I&#039;m wrong in my understanding.</p><p>Either way, thank you so much for helping me with this.&nbsp; Now that ping worked, I hope to be able to connect through telnet and start setting things up.</p><p>Your help is greatly appreciated. and I love this forum.&nbsp; If things don&#039;t work as planned, or if I run into any more snags, it&#039;s likely I&#039;ll be back.&nbsp; Thanks so much, again, for your great help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your response.</p><p>I was able to get telnet to work and was able to enter a password as was described on the &quot;First time log in&quot; page.&nbsp; According to that page, I won&#039;t be able to use telnet again but will have to log in via SSH.&nbsp; Because I&#039;m using windows,&nbsp; I&#039;ll use PuTTY as you&#039;ve suggested.</p><p>Because I&#039;m not going to be using telnet again, should I still be concerned with the address being 192.168.1.1?</p><p>Everything that I&#039;ve done up to this point is strictly based on what the openwrt website has instructed me to do.&nbsp; </p><p>I own a virgin mobile USB modem and I want to hook it up to a USB router.&nbsp; So I bought the TP-MR3040 router at Walmart (the same place where I bought the USB modem).&nbsp; I hooked up the router according to the instructions, but it didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I quickly found out that the TP-MR3040 router doesn&#039;t support my USB modem.</p><p>I was reading the product reviews of the TP-MR3040 on amazon.com.&nbsp; I wanted to see what people were saying about it and if anyone else had gotten it to work with a different modem.&nbsp; As I was looking, I read a review that said that the router doesn&#039;t work with a lot of modems, but that it&#039;s possible to get it to work by using openwrt.</p><p>That was the first time I had heard of openwrt.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even know what it was at the time.&nbsp; So I went to the openwrt website and saw that it does indeed support my router.&nbsp; So I replaced the router&#039;s firmware with the suggested firmware from openwrt, expecting it to work right after installing it.&nbsp; Once I noticed that it wasn&#039;t working, I read more about openwrt, and learned that it&#039;s a matter of configuring the router correctly.&nbsp; So that has started me on this quest.</p><p>I&#039;ll admit that I&#039;m not too familiar with linux.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t know much about computer networks or&nbsp; how modems or routers work.&nbsp; I know what they do, but not how they work.</p><p>I say all of this because I want to be clear on what I&#039;m ultimately trying to do.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to set up my USB modem to work with the router.&nbsp; Because it&#039;s simply a matter of getting the right configuration, I figured I&#039;d just follow the recommended instructions for a typical system.&nbsp; So I found the &quot;Beginner&#039;s Guide&quot; on the openwrt website, and started there.&nbsp; Everything that I choose to do, and nearly all that I know about what to do, I&#039;m getting from the direction of the openwrt website.&nbsp; I&#039;m following the instructions for a system that most closely resembles mine.&nbsp; I have a 3g/4g USB modem, so I&#039;m following the configuration steps for a &quot;3g&quot; dongle setup.</p><p>A long time ago, I tried to host my own website by setting up a LAMP system.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know anything about linux or apache, but was a little more familiar with MySQL and PHP.&nbsp; I got a book that explained how to setup a LAMP system, and simply followed the instructions step-by-step until I finally got the thing to work.&nbsp; I never mastered, or even learned much more about apache or linux, but was able to get it to work.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I intend to do here.&nbsp; Is such an approach feasible?&nbsp; Is it merely a matter of choosing the right settings, and modifying the right files in order to get it to work, or can this only be done with a deep knowledge of linux and openwrt?</p><p>I&#039;m sorry to type such a long post, but I want to be open about my intent on how I plan to get the router to work, and also about my lack of mastering linux or openwrt.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been stepping through the process slowly with incremental success, but I haven&#039;t mastered anything.&nbsp; I only learned about what telnet is because the beginner&#039;s guide page said that it is what I could use in order to complete the &quot;first log in&quot; stage of setting things up.&nbsp; The same thing is true about PuTTY.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t heard of it until I was told that it&#039;s needed in order to continue.&nbsp; This is the way that I&#039;ve been stepping through this process.&nbsp; I&#039;m not mastering anything, but am simply going from step to step until the thing finally works.</p><p>So I used the 192.168.1.1 address because that&#039;s what openwrt said to use on the beginner&#039;s page.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;ve entered the password, and won&#039;t be going back to telnet, do I still have to worry about this setting?&nbsp; It says that I&#039;ll now be logging in via SSH.</p><p>I&#039;ve now gotten to the point where it says I should backup my configuration.&nbsp; Because of what it says at the bottom of the Generic backup page of the openwrt website, I typed the following at the &quot;root@OpenWrt:~#&quot; prompt.</p><p>&quot;cd /etc; tar cvz config&quot; &gt; openwrt.tar.gz</p><p>As a result, I received the following message:</p><p>-ash: cd /etc; tar cvz config: not found</p><p>Do I have to create a directory, or do I have to specify a more absolute path?</p><p>Thanks again for all of your help and input.&nbsp; Because you now know a little more concerning what I&#039;m trying to do, and my lack of experience, I&#039;m interested in knowing whether or not you believe it&#039;s feasible for me to configure my router with minimal knowledge of linux or openwrt.&nbsp; The openwrt website does tend to show the basics of what it takes to setup a system.&nbsp; However, I do tend to run into snags every once in a while.</p>									</div>
