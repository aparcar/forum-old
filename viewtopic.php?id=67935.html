					<p>Apologies if I&#039;m in the wrong place to post this. I just need some advice on where to go or who to contact regarding employing an expert to create a router firmware using OPEN WRT which my company can use to configure an off-the-shelf router to fit our specific needs to be used within the company.</p><p>Our requirements would be a firmware which in it&#039;s default state....</p><p>Has a specific IP address.<br />Has a specific Admin Password.<br />Is set to a specific DHCP range.<br />Has a specific SSID with the WIfI password disabled.</p><p>Which I&#039;d imagine are the easy bits.</p><p>Then in addition to this, we&#039;d also like to know if it would be possible to adapt existing buttons/switches on the hardware device to...</p><p>A. Enable / Disable the DHCP server.<br />B. Adjust the WiFi radio channel (preferably without a re-boot).</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p><p>Alan</p>									</div>

					<p>This is definitely a wrong section, but a lot of people can do what you need to accomplish. Easy bits are (like you said) easy, additional stuff might take a bit more time depending on the router and wherever OpenWrt/LEDE properly supports buttons for that specific hardware.</p><p>I suggest you post a new thread in General section with the more specific requirements (which hardware, which button does what), how to contact you and the reward offered.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 7 Oct 2016, 00:28)</p>
