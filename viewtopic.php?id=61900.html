					<p>Hello everyone!<br />I&#039;m from Vietnam and currently I&#039;m having an OpenWrt-Powered TL-WR841N.<br />Recently I&#039;ve installed Trunk build (31-Dec-2015), the sysupgrade one. But after the router rebooted, I couldn&#039;t connect to it even when I had tried many ways. When I access LuCI, I got &quot;ERROR_CONNECTION_REFUSED&quot; (I&#039;m using Chromium). Connecting via SSH by PuTTY was also hopeless, I got the same error.<br />So, has anyone had workarounds for this problem?? If you have, please show me. Thanks a lot for ur help.</p>									</div>
