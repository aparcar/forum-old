					<p>Hi, </p><p>As a new member of this forum I want to say hello to everyone here, and thank the community and the admins for giving life to this interesting place. </p><p>I am trying to control some Canon cameras using gphoto2 (<a href="http://www.gphoto.org">www.gphoto.org</a>) in my openWrt Arduino Yun. To achieve what I need, one of the gphoto2 developers told me I need to run the latest version of gphoto2 which is 2.5.8. Unfortunately I have not found this recent version compiled for openWrt.</p><p>I am fairly new to linux in general and openWrt in particular, so excuse if this question is too basic. Do you know if anyone has compiled gphoto 2.5.8. If not, can someone point me in the direction on how to compile it for openWrt?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pacific15</strong> on 3 Sep 2015, 04:18)</p>
