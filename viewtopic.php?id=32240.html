					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am planning to run my proposed customized routing and channel assignment algorithms on WRT54GL router and am looking for steps in implementing my proposed algorithms. I am a newbie on this forum and have absolutely no idea about how to approach this problem.</p><p>I have used NS2 simulator for implementing my protocols before and now am planning to test them on actual routers.</p><p>I plan to first run the routing algorithm, test it and then the channel assignment meaning that they both are separate algorithms.</p><p>Any suggestions, pointers, tutorials or any help in this regard would be highly appreciable.</p><p>The routing algorithm should be able to populate forwarding table and send control packets. The channel assignment algorithm should be able to read the RSSI values of the radio and based on that decide which channel to use and relay this information to neighboring nodes.</p><p>Thanks,<br />--Bokhari</p>									</div>

					<p>I suggest to first attempt to setup OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N. on OpenWrt. Those are layer 3 routing protocols which will help you to understand the following things:<br /> - howto build and install OpenWrt<br /> - howto install or integrate packages<br /> - howto configure OpenWrt<br /> - howto debug a network (or mesh I suppose)</p><p>Here are some pointers:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/mesh.olsr">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/mesh.olsr</a><br /><a href="http://olsr.org/?q=about">http://olsr.org/?q=about</a><br /><a href="http://www.open-mesh.org/wiki/batman-adv">http://www.open-mesh.org/wiki/batman-adv</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Jow for the pointers. I will get back to you if I stumble into something else. I still haven&#039;t got my WRT54GL, hopefully will get it next week then would start working on this, but thanks anyways.</p><p>Best</p>									</div>
