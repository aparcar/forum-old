					<p>The next problem after installing rfkill seems to be that it is loaded after cfg80211, as both get priority 20. Don&#039;t know whether changing that will fix everything, because at that point I gave up and rebuilt without rfkill.</p>									</div>

					<p>I changed the cfg80211 dependency in /etc/modules.d/20-cfg80211 file, putting rfkill before cfg80211 entry. This way rfkill loads before cfg80211 even though both have same priority (20). This seems to have fixed the problem, but I have to do some further testing. In any case the related ticket has been assigned so I assume it will be fixed in trunk really soon.</p>									</div>

					<p>the module loading happens alphabetically based on the filenames in /etc/modules.d . so 20-cfg80211 and 20-rfkill alphabetically means 20-cfg80211 loads first.... well tries to load, because of the missing symbols it won&#039;t load. then anything later that needs cfg80211 won&#039;t load.... like mac80211, and then your actuall wireless driver ath9k or whatever. it&#039;s a chain of modules that require the previous one to be loaded or it can&#039;t load... break the first link with cfg80211 not loading and then none of the rest will load.</p><p>so if you are on an already installed system just rename it like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mv /etc/modules.d/20-rfkill /etc/modules.d/15-rfkill</code></pre></div><p>another issue someone mentioned in one of the related tickets is that the entire rfkill package is not set as a dependency for some wireless driver(s) and therefore you need to opkg install it manually.... and if you are building your own trunk, you will need to go and select it to be built.</p>									</div>
