					<p>strange, there&#039;s quite a few forum and bug tracker posts where the feature and it&#039;s non-function are being discussed. none of them with a working solution unfortunately.</p><p>i&#039;ve also seen posts where the rp-pppoe-client package is mentioned, which atm is &#039;broken.&#039; is that what you&#039;re refering to with &quot;not implemented atm?&quot;</p><p>if i managed to compile that package myself and install it, might that get dial-on-demand working with a &#039;barrier breaker&#039; image?</p>									</div>

					<p>answering my own question: no. </p><p>the rp-pppoe-client package, while it can be installed into &#039;barrier beaker,&#039; would need to be completely re-written for the way network interfaces &amp; connections are handled now.</p><p>any pointers where to look if i want to figure out why the heck IP and default route are dropped when demand &gt; 0? no matter what i do with pppd or pppoe options, as soon as demand &gt; 0 the link&#039;s IP becomes 10.64.64.64, remote 10.112.112.</p><p>there must be a way to tackle this...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phani00</strong> on 6 Aug 2014, 19:13)</p>

					<p>got this working to some extent: setting &quot;option demand &#039;60&#039;&quot; in /etc/config/network and adding &lt;client-IP&gt;:&lt;server-IP&gt; to /etc/ppp/options gets the pppoe connection running. unfortunately the default route gets dropped, no matter what i do with the &#039;defaultroute&#039; param in options. that shouldn&#039;t happen IMO, but it does.</p><p>tried to add it again via a script in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/ and via the &#039;connect&#039; parameter in /etc/ppp/options, but none of that works. adding the route manually from the command line does work, but isn&#039;t useful in practice. what would be a good place to add the default route without having to do it manually?</p>									</div>

					<p>no, it&#039;s not the filter. taking out the filter completely doesn&#039;t work either. i&#039;m thinking towards firewall rules now; unfortunately not something i understand very well&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>when i ping anything from within the router, pppoe actually connects. traffic is registered, pppoe is authorized, and the connection works.

					<p>feeling stupid: there&#039;s a really easy solution to this: set the clients&#039; nameserver not to the router IP, but the pppoe server&#039;s. any request they make will cause the router to contact DNS via the main server, bringing the link up. this should probably not be necessary, the router should do that on it&#039;s own, but right now i don&#039;t care.</p><p>makes me wonder why you, jow, said this feature wasn&#039;t supported atm? it certainly is, if not through luci configuration alone, but still.</p>									</div>

					<p>It interacts badly with netifd since pppd is altering system routes by its own without notifying the upper layers. A properly integrated solution is complex to implement properly and thus not done yet.</p>									</div>
