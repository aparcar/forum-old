					<p>hi everyone,</p><p>I have recently seen in the development branch that USB support has been added for the lantiq XWAY platform. <br />I am currently working on the Danube EASY50712 reference board, but the hardware version of the board I am using is quite old<br />(v1.2 with ADM6996 Ethernet PHY, 8MB MX Flash and 32MB RAM) - even the processor itself is Infineon labeled and not Lantiq.<br />I have successufully set-up backfire on the board and I have a fully functional ADSL modem/router except for the USB port,<br />as that is not supported on the ifxmips target. Therefore I would like to ask if it is possible to backport the development<br />branch USB driver to backfire, and if possible, get some basic guidelines on how to do it -i.e header files to be replaced inside dwc_otd code, <br />as I am not actively involved into driver development. I believe that the recent versions of the Danube processor also have the <br />same USB host controller, from synopsys, so porting the driver should be feasible, right?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance....</p>									</div>
