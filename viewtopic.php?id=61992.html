					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>On a TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v8 using OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530), I have the following interfaces:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Minxzwe.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/Minxzwe.png" /></span></p><p>When the PPTP is connected, giving me an IP 10.0.0.1-5 from the VPN server, a Synology NAS, I have internet access and I can map locally network drives located at the remote LAN, but all my port forwardings stops working. Status &gt; Network shows as WAN only the PPTP. Is that the expected result?</p><p>How get the PPTP session established without breaking routes/port forwardings? I suppose that this is related to static routes, but I&#039;m not sure really and there are so many approaches regarding VPN that I really need help with this issue.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jg2t4.gif" alt="http://i.imgur.com/jg2t4.gif" /></span></p>									</div>
