					<p>In every case it&#039;s not good to install packages from trunk if you have an old trunk firmware image... And they becomes old even after a week!</p>									</div>

					<p>hnyman,</p><p>Thank you very much for the clarification.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only thing I had as a reference was the WDR-4300 hardware support page which instructs you to install from the latest trunk binaries.&nbsp; I assumed that trunks newer than the first supported version would support the WDR-4300 and I was right.</p><p>I was aware that AA was forked from an earlier trunk several weeks ago (I thought the references on the wiki page were to it being forked from 33624).&nbsp; &nbsp;Trunk 33624 should have contained patches for at least the 1.0 and 1.1 revs of the WDR-4300 hardware.&nbsp; In fact (as it states on the WDR-4300 page), AA beta 2 contains patches for everything up to the 1.2 version of the hardware.&nbsp; The same page also says that v1.3 of the hardware needs trunk 34122.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s too early in the morning for me to figure out if that&#039;s included in AA anywhere.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;ll install AA beta 2 and be happy.</p><p>Thanks again hnyman.</p><p>(BTW: Here is the hardware support page I was referring to: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300)</a></p><p>(BBTW: To the person who suggested I build it separately: Thank you -- I&#039;m aware of that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just needed to get something with a UI installed this weekend without diving into replicating the build and install image environment.&nbsp; No telling how many dependencies or environment-specific tweaks I might run into.).</p><p>Thanks to all of you for the suggestions.</p>									</div>
