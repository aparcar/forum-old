					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am trying to compile an image on buildroot-ng.<br />Problem : I don&#039;t find some of the packages I need in svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/.<br />For example, ntpclient doesn&#039;t seem to be part of the list.</p><p>(I need libstdc++, iwlib, openssh-sftp-server, wificonf as well)</p><p>Question : may I use the Whiterussian branch files (Makefile, files, etc.) instead ?<br />The Makefile (s) look somehow different to me and I&#039;m not sure how Buildroot will deal with it.</p><p>EDIT<br />Answer seems to be NO. But maybe is there a way or guidelines to migrate Makefiles-pre-buildroot-ng to the new system.<br />Any advice welcome.<br />EDIT/</p><p>Or do I have to write my own Makefile, files (what do I do about the .svn directory ?)</p><p>Or maybe someone did write those files already...</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p><p>cheers,</p><p>engage</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>engage</strong> on 27 Nov 2006, 17:39)</p>
