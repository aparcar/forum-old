					<p>Dear all,</p><p>I have a problem with the asterisk internal http server.<br />It is confirmed as running and I am able to access the private pages - /httpstatus; /amanager; /arawman; /manager; /rawman; /amxml; /mxml; /ws . I am also able to login with the default admin username and pass. </p><p>However I am unable to access the /static/.. content even if I have present </p><p>enablestatic=yes</p><p>in my http.conf.</p><p>I have a symlinks in my /var/lib/asterisk and /usr/share/asterisk pointing to /usr/lib/asterisk... but no go.</p><p>Did a strace to find out what asterisk is reading. To my surprise it even didn&#039;t try to access static-http dir.</p><p>When I try to access anything I get error 404, except when I try to get /static/ then I&#039;ve error 403.</p><p>All the threads and advices points to creation of a symlinks to /var/lib/asterisk and /usr/share/asterisk. </p><p>However this solution is not working with me.</p><p>I am using&nbsp; OpenWRT Barrier Breaker (14.07, r42625) on x86 hardware.</p><p>Is it has to do something with the file access rights? Should they be owned by root, or by any other user?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>void_runner</strong> on 23 Aug 2015, 16:53)</p>

					<p>OK.. found out how to resolve the issue.</p><p>The http server of Asterisk 11.12.0 is looking for it&#039;s static content in /static-http/ and this folder should be located to /var/lib/asterisk.<br />So the whole path should look like this: /var/lib/asterisk/static-http/<br />There&#039;s no privilege escalation on this path or its content.</p><p>However in order to access the static content, one should go to:<br />http://&lt;openwrt_IP&gt;:&lt;configured_port&gt;/static/&lt;document_to_be_accessed&gt;</p><p>By default asterisk-gui puts index.html in its /static-http/ folder. This file contains HTTP redirection to /static/config/index.html</p><p>If the user access &quot;http://&lt;openwrt_IP&gt;:&lt;configured_port&gt;/static&quot; the normal behaviour of the http server is to return error 403, since it is forbidden to browse the content of the folder, and the server itself is not instruct to redirect the request by default to index file (as it is with most of the web servers).<br />If you like such behavior, one should create a redirection into http.conf like this:</p><p>redirect= / /static/config/index.html</p><p>This way the http server of asterisk will direct your request from the root to the asterisk-gui config login page.</p><p>A request for maintainers.<br />Please correct the gui_http.conf with redirect clause.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>P.S.: or perhaps it might be better to raise an issue with the bugtracker? Tell me which one is best..</p>									</div>
