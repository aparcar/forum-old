					<p><strong>@sharkys:</strong> I&#039;ve been using the last version ever since I posted it and I&#039;m not getting any delays or timeouts, so I think the problem is either due to your configuration or some packages you installed. First of all, are you sure HW NAT is really off because these are the symptoms I was getting when it was still on in the previous version?</p><p>The kernel log message for <em>PeerDelBATxAdaptTimeOut()</em> is just due to debug mode being enabled at build time. You can check the details yourself in the source code: </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/mtk-wifi-gpl/blob/master/include/rtmp_timer.h#L154">https://github.com/openwrt/mtk-wifi-gpl … mer.h#L154</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?v=2.6.31;i=BUILD_TIMER_FUNCTION">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?v=2 … R_FUNCTION</a></p></li></ul><p> It seems harmless. At the very least, I also keep getting it without any problems.</p><p>The only other problem I found is with <strong>/etc/config/ngrokc</strong>, much like the hyphen thing in <strong>/etc/config/sqm</strong> but here it turns out that spaces cannot be used in section names as well, so if you change <em>&#039;Example Tunnel&#039;</em> and <em>&#039;Example Server&#039;</em> to anything without a space in it (or a hyphen), it should work fine.</p><p><strong>General comment for people who want to use extra packages:</strong> new PandoraBox versions keep popping up, and the changes are quite significant, but their package repository has not been updated recently, so I&#039;d be surprised if this eventually did <span class="bbu">not</span> cause some problems, similar to what happens on OpenWrt trunk if your base is out of sync with the repository. I think in many cases things can still be made to work on a per-package basis but it might take some gymnastics. If you&#039;re not comfortable with it, your options include using one of the older versions, although it&#039;ll be a trade-off, so I&#039;d say the newest version is the best to go with unless you have a reason not to. The previous versions are kept in the downloads folder too just in case anyone wants to use them instead.</p><p><strong>@gazambuja:</strong> I too would like to know what can be done to improve stock OpenWrt on this device. If anyone has any feasible ideas, please let us know. On a related note, it appears that the initial OpenWrt support for Xiaomi WiFi Mini is in fact due to the work of PandoraBox guys: <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.embedded.openwrt.devel/29839/focus=29840">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.embe … ocus=29840</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>StrangeOrange</strong> on 29 Jan 2016, 14:47)</p>

					<p>First of all, thank you for your newer versions, second thank you for your detailed and well explained answerm I owe you a beer. I tried what you said and it worked as you said! Now im able to scan networks with 5ghz interface and also set it up as a repeater. Only problem is the number of signals returned by the 5ghz scanning is just 2 (one of them is the other 2.4ghz in miwifi lol), it seems like this interface, i mean its driver, its somehow not so optimized so the range of the scan is very limited, might be something misconfigured on my side dont really know. I will try latest release, thanks StrangeOrange keep up this good work!!!</p><p>Regards</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>StrangeOrange wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>FENIX81 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I have setup 2.4ghz to act as a repeater, strong signal and flawless. Now I want to do the same with 5ghz, repeat another wifi signal, problem is that i cannot get results while scanning with this interface, i would like to put it in the same mode than the 2.4ghz and get all those results while scanning so i can repeat one of them with 5ghz interface, I don&#039;t know how can I achieve it (in case it is possible, maybe not?)</p></blockquote></div><p>The complete configuration settings for each interface are saved in <strong>/tmp/profiles/rt2860v2_<em>&lt;2|5&gt;</em>g.dat</strong> (these are generated by the scripts in <strong>/lib/netifd/wireless/*</strong> and <strong>/lib/wifi/*</strong>). The good news is, since both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz seem to be using the same driver (rt2860v2), the settings are in the same format, and as you already managed to set it up on 2.4 GHz, perhaps you could move the relevant settings to the other file to see if that makes it work the same way too.</p><p>Those files are overwritten every time the scripts run but it seems they are only being used indirectly because of the symbolic links to them from <strong>/etc/Wireless/MT76X2/MT7612.dat</strong> and <strong>/etc/Wireless/RT2860/RT2860.dat</strong>, which are the configuration file paths that are actually hard-coded into the driver:</p><p><strong>strings /lib/modules/`uname -r`/mt76x2e.ko | fgrep /etc/</strong></p><p>Knowing this, to test your own settings for the 5 GHz interface, you could: </p><ul><li><p>Comment out line 29 in <strong>/lib/wifi/mt7612.sh</strong> by putting a pound (#) sign in front of it. This disables relinking to the automatically-generated config file:</p></li></ul><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><span style="color: red"><strong>#</strong></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ln -s $CFG_FILES_2ND /etc/Wireless/MT76X2/MT7612.dat 2&gt;/dev/null</p></blockquote></div><ul><li><p>Remove the currently existing link:<br /><strong>rm -f /etc/Wireless/MT76X2/MT7612.dat</strong><br /></p></li><li><p>Link the configuration file the driver expects to find to your custom file:<br /><strong>ln -s MT76X2_Experiment.dat /etc/Wireless/MT76X2/MT7612.dat</strong><br /></p></li><li><p>Create your own configuration by merging the relevant settings from <strong>/tmp/profiles/*.dat</strong> and save it as <strong>/etc/Wireless/MT76X2/MT7612_Experiment.dat</strong></p></li></ul><p>Note: I didn&#039;t test this, so it might need some polishing, but in principle it should work, and this trick could also be adopted to straighten out other driver configuration-related driver issues (regulatory domain, WPS state, etc.) without extensively modifying the script files, and just bypassing them altogether instead.</p><p>As for what the particular settings mean and how to adjust them, maybe the text files included in this source code of a related driver can be helpful: <a href="http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=570477101&amp;uk=939937960">download link</a>, <a href="http://www.right.com.cn/forum/thread-128299-1-1.html">discussion</a> (Chinese).

As for the workaround, I flashed the Breed bootloader while still on stock firmware, and once you have Breed, you can reflash it anytime with another bootloader from within Breed.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Benik3 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2.)

If there&#039;s some stuff you don&#039;t need, you could consider editing the patch sources to remove it and making a custom version of the firmware for yourself, although note that just the Wi-Fi driver module <strong>/lib/modules/3.14.56/mt76x2e.ko</strong> is nearly 2 MiB by itself in the current version, so there are limits to how much space can be freed. Or you can consider going back to release 1216, which was smaller.

					<p>Thanks for reply! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Ad 1.) well we have original sources for OpenWRT 15.05 or 14.09 here so we could use one build to just update u-boot.

I remember that I had more space. Luckily the Virtual Here didn&#039;t took as much space as I expected, so I have still 2,5MB free.

After change it works OK, sorry <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Ad 5.) I recommended WMM enabled because some wireless cards have problems to connect to wifi without WMM.
