					<p>This one has me stumped...</p><p>I use a 4G connection + a VPN connection to bypass CGNAT:</p><p>- The 4G dongle is wwan0, the router connects to the dongle&#039;s internal DHCP server (192.168.1.1) and gets its address (192.168.1.100) / DNS settings - these are written to /tmp/resolve.conf.auto.<br />- OpenVPN launches over tun0 as vpn0 - the DNS settings are set by swapping the resolv.conf.auto file with one containing my VPN server address.</p><p>This works up to the point the router&#039;s IP address is renewed with the dongle.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>daemon.notice netifd: wan (1193): Sending renew...
daemon.notice netifd: wan (1193): Lease of 192.168.1.100 obtained, lease time 86400
daemon.info dnsmasq[1822]: reading /tmp/resolv.conf.auto
daemon.info dnsmasq[1822]: using local addresses only for domain lan
daemon.info dnsmasq[1822]: using nameserver 192.168.1.1#53
daemon.info dnsmasq[1822]: using nameserver 192.168.1.1#53</code></pre></div><p>When the IP address of WAN is renewed resolve.conf.auto gets rewritten back to the original file, removing the VPN setting. [DNS leak happening]</p><p>How do I stop this happening? Is there an elegant solution (a hotplug.d script?) or is something brute force required (cronjob)?</p>									</div>

					<p>A brute force method that seems to work is to change the dongle network config from DHCP to static:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.100&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
    option dns &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
    option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
       option ifname &#039;wwan0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>With this, resolve.conf.auto is populated with &quot;nameserver 192.168.1.1&quot;. </p><p>Then when the VPN comes up (after a sleep 10) a script is run to move resolve.conf.auto to resolve.conf.auto.hold and make a new file with the VPN DNS setting. This gets read by dnsmasq.</p><p>So by switching to static I should have solved the IP address renew issue. I don&#039;t see any issue with running the dongle in this manner, as yet.</p>									</div>
