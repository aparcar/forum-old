					<p>Hey guys, </p><p>i found a nice old hardware firewall from 3COM (OfficeConnect FireWall25 / 3C16770) on my attic and it would be the perfect device for a OpenWrt Router.</p><p>The device is driven by a Motorola (Freescale) MC68360 microcontroller with 4M of RAM and 2M of Flash.</p><p>I could not found information about this controller in the OpenWrt forum, but does anybody of you have experience with devices which has this controller? <br />Is it possible to use it with OpenWrt?<br />Is there a precompiled OpenWrt version for thi platform?</p><p>Thanks a lot - best regards <br />Florian</p>									</div>
