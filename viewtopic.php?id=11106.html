					<p>UPDATE: I solved this on my own while I was writing this.&nbsp; I am going to post it so in case anybody ever makes the same mistake, they will be able to search for it on the forum.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Hello there.&nbsp; I have probably read the documentation for Kamikaze five times over, searched the forums many times, and experimented a good long while, but I just can&#039;t get this to work.</p><p>I have a WRT54G v4 flashed with Kamikaze 7.06.&nbsp; I want my router to broadcast two different SSIDs, both with different encryption levels.&nbsp; One of them will use PSK2 and the other WEP.&nbsp; The one that uses PSK2 I want to bridge with my vlan0 interface like normal (basically, the default configuration).&nbsp; It will be part of the 192.168.1.x/24 range.&nbsp; Anybody that access via WEP I want to be placed in the 192.168.2.x/24 network.&nbsp; Basically, I want WEP users to be segmented from the hardwired and PSK2 users.</p><p>I have tried many different things trying to get this to work.&nbsp; My last configuration tried something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-- /etc/config/network --

					<p>it is not necessary to use vlans for this unless you have a reason to (possible reasons I can think of: connection to different physical networks at the device - vlans used on the internal switch, openwrt is not your firewall and you want the traffic managed at the firewall, you have a large network using vlans in the traditional way and want users to connect to their department network). otherwise, you can manage this with the firewall rules</p>									</div>

					<p>Good to know. I wish this entire subject were better documented. I bet there are quite a few people with old hardware that can only do WEP they would like to utilize in a (relatively) safe and restricted manner.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nalin - your instructions were perfect.&nbsp; They covered exactly what I needed to do, and everything worked right the first time.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve never run OpenWRT before this evening, so that&#039;s saying something!&nbsp; But anyway, to follow-up to Lorphos&#039; first question... for the specific case of using this setup to put the &quot;real&quot; computers on a WPA/WPA2 WLAN and Nintendo games on a WEP WLAN...&nbsp; I bought a WRT54GL (replacing my WRT54Gv5) and installed Kamikaze for just that purpose, and tonight was the night to set it all up.</p><p>I started by configuring the Nintendo Wii to be on the WEP WLAN (it had been on my one single WPA WLAN).&nbsp; I told it to search for access points, it displayed them both, I picked WEP, entered the key, and everything just worked.&nbsp; Simple.</p><p>Not so with DS #1, DS #2, or the DSLite.&nbsp; Apparently, not only did Nintendo give us crappy firmware that won&#039;t handle WPA, they gave us crappy firmware that barely handles Wi-Fi at all.&nbsp; When I told the DS to search for access points, it would usually fail and complain that the access point wanted security that it didn&#039;t support -- it was finding the WPA SSID and failing to see the WEP SSID.&nbsp; But once in a while it would work, and find the WEP SSID.&nbsp; But as soon as I enetered the key and did &quot;test connection&quot; it would fail every single time.&nbsp; And entering the WEP SSID manually didn&#039;t help either - it would still fail on &quot;test connection.&quot;</p><p>Finally, after about 90 minutes of flailing around uselessly, something prompted me to try switching the order in which the WLANs are configured in /etc/config/wireless.&nbsp; So, I rearranged it so that the WEP WLAN comes first in the file and the WPA WLAN comes second.&nbsp; Eureka!&nbsp; The DSes and the DSLite suddenly work!&nbsp; I had to tell the Windows XP box to look for the access point by name (instead of search), but as soon as I did that it connected just fine, and now that it knows it&#039;s there, it reconnects on its own.</p><p>I am still amazed that not only has Nintendo still not fixed this issue with a firmware update, but they didn&#039;t even fix it in the DSLite.&nbsp; Sony issued a patch for the PSP to support it within a few months of the PSP coming out.</p><p>Oh well, it works, and the kids are happy.&nbsp; One more thing to cross off the list of things to do.&nbsp; :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tnstatc</strong> on 28 Jul 2007, 06:38)</p>

					<p>I had the same idea but it doesn&#039;t work (yet).</p><p>Did you also change the order in /etc/config/network?<br />What does &quot;iwconfig&quot; show?

					<p>I did discover one other thing as I used it some more.... Windows XP laptop using an old v1.0 Linksys card was having problems connecting.&nbsp; It would see the &quot;right&quot; (WPA) access point, but when I&#039;d go to connect, it would confuse itself and think it wanted WEP instead of WPA even though it used WPA the last time.&nbsp; Fiddling around with the &quot;Advanced settings&quot; in the &quot;View wireless networks&quot; window would eventually get it connected, but it required fiddling.</p><p>I&#039;m GUESSING that XP and the DSes are having trouble because they&#039;re storing some or all of the information on an access point using the MAC address as the lookup key instead of the SSID, and they&#039;re getting the wrong data (or overwriting one with the other) since both access points in this case have the same MAC address.</p><p>So, this afternoon I thought I&#039;d try setting &quot;option hidden 1&quot; on the WEP access point.&nbsp; Since all the DSes and the Wii know about it now, it doesn&#039;t need to advertise, and that should keep the XP box from seeing information from two access points with the same MAC address.</p><p>Sure enough, this seems to help.&nbsp; The XP box is much happier now; it sees the single access point it &quot;should&quot; see and connects right up.&nbsp; So, if you can make one of the access points &#039;hide&quot; in your environment, it&#039;s worth trying if you&#039;re having problems.</p>									</div>
