					<p>I see that a page I used to maintain is in &quot;oldwiki&quot; but seems to be in some sort of<br />migration process to nuwiki.&nbsp; The photos are all missing.&nbsp; Were they lost in the<br />migration?&nbsp; If they are still available somewhere I can reattach them when the<br />page is officially open for edits again.&nbsp; However I didn&#039;t keep the original photo<br />files so I&#039;m hope they are still around on OpenWRT servers somewhere.....</p><p>This page is the one I am speaking of:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/linksys/wrtsl54gs">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt â€¦ /wrtsl54gs</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I was thinking that most of the photos were linked to files stored elsewhere?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think they were actually uploaded to the wiki, but of course, I could be wrong there.&nbsp; I do remember having a few pics posted, and thought I remembered them linking directly to my web site.</p><p>Someone with more intimate knowledge of the wiki will need to answer this one, many of those old pics won&#039;t be easy to recreate if they&#039;re now lost.</p>									</div>

					<p>I made pages on the old wiki, and pics were definitely uploaded not linked.&nbsp; I recall spending time converting them to appropriate sizes for upload.&nbsp; So yes this is a problem.&nbsp; How do I get in touch with anyone in the OpenWRT Wiki group, does anyone know?</p>									</div>
