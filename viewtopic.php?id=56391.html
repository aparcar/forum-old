I have a buildroot up and running and also an SDK.<br />However, I can not compile the package, I constantly get this:<br />libncurses make: *** [world] Error 1</p><p>I am trying on 14.07 stable, AR71xx, TL-WR842ND . I cannot succeed, please help!<br />I have found a git with a makefile for splix:<br /><a href="https://github.com/FranciscoBorges/openwrt-printing-packages">https://github.com/FranciscoBorges/open â€¦ g-packages</a></p><p>The described method not working for me...</p><p>If somebody could compile the package for me, It would be also really appreciated!</p><br /><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>
