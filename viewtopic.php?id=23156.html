Since you are booting off USB, you need to wait until the USB drive settles for it to be available. What is happening is by the time the kernel is done loading the drive hasn&#039;t settled yet so it is not recognized.</p>									</div>

Plus that is for scsi commands, and it is the USB module that needs to settle and scan the drives first. I don&#039;t believe this will cause the boot process to hold until booting has finished.</p>									</div>
