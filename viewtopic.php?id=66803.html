					<p>Just in case you weren&#039;t aware, you can get builds for the EA3500 here -</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/kirkwood/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots â€¦ d/generic/</a></p><p>The EA3500 uses the audi builds. Also, you can boot into the working partition of the EA3500 by following this process - </p><p>1 Plug in the EA3500/4500<br />2 Power led will blink rapidly<br />3 Power led will turn off<br />4 As soon as the power led turns off, unplug the router<br />5 Wait a few seconds<br />6 Plug the router back in and repeat the above process</p><p>Do that three times, on the fourth time keep the router plugged in and let it boot, hopefully you will now have a functioning router again.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure, but it sounds like you&#039;re trying to boot on the third time instead of the fourth, so just to make sure we&#039;re on the same page, the process to switch to the other partition should look like this - </p><p>turn on/turn off</p><p>turn on/turn off</p><p>turn on/turn off</p><p>turn on/leave on and let boot....</p><p>If that doesn&#039;t work and you want to try reflashing over ssh, you can use sysupgrade, if you want to read up on it you can do so here - <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a></p><p>But for now here&#039;s the simple instructions, if you&#039;re flashing from OpenWrt you need the sysupgrade.tar file (the .bin file is for flashing from Linksys firmware), so copy the openwrt-kirkwood-linksys-audi-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar to the /tmp file of your EA3500 and then ssh into your EA3500 and run the sysupgrade command - </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sysupgrade -n /tmp/openwrt-kirkwood-linksys-audi-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar</code></pre></div><p>The -n option is to erase previous config files so you&#039;ll have a nice clean flash to work from, hopefully that will get you up and running.</p>									</div>
