					<p>I&#039;m having problems with my macbook pro retina running OSX 10.9.4. Connectivity drops every now and then with full WIFI signal, the only way to fix it is to disconnect from WIFI and reconnect again. I have this problem with 12.09 where the issue is described here <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13966">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13966</a> </p><p>So I did upgrade to 14.07, the problem is still happening but not that often as with 12.09 but it is still there. Anybody facing similar issues? other clients at home work well so it is specific to OSX. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve seen this very strange issue but usually a reboot of the router seems to fix it and I can&#039;t reproduce it. Only happened to me a couple of times maybe. Not sure if it&#039;s a firmware issue or something with the client. I just had it with OSX Yosemite on my MBA.</p>									</div>

					<p>The router I&#039;m using is TP-Link TL-WR842N/ND v1, it keeps happening every now and then and it only impacts my Mac, other iphone, ipad and android works without an issue so it is specific to Mac. On the other hand my Mac works at work without any problems.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>samitro</strong> on 8 Sep 2014, 22:05)</p>

					<p>Thanks, everything goes offline including my IM, chrome and others. The weird thing is that WIFI still shows full signal and while I can ping the router I can&#039;t connect to it over SSH from my mac. I can do so through from other clients. Sometimes if I give it few minutes then it recovers on it&#039;s own.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had this problem once briefly after doing a trunk upgrade where several configuration file changes were made. Wired worked fine if I remember correctly. I reset to defaults and everything was fine. if you haven&#039;t tried that, give it a shot.</p>									</div>

I was having the problem with the previous openwrt release and that&#039;s why I did upgrade this 14.07. I&#039;ll try to reset the router and see if it helps. thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s a client issue not the router or firmware. Had the same thing with my WNDR3700V1 for years and my new WDR4900 as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 9 Sep 2014, 10:27)</p>

					<p>So again and again, I have this problem with Openwrt. Below is a copy of the post I submitted at Apple forums. </p><p>From time to time while browsing, web pages stops loading and all connections to the internet fail. This happens randomly. The only thing that works is ping, I can ping my router, I can ping websites on the internet but all TCP connections fail including HTTP/SSH connection to my router. Wireless signal shows full. Sometimes the problem recovers itself if I give it several minutes but I rarely wait, I fix the problem by turning WIFI off and then on. Wireless diagnostics does not show any problem. This is happening only with my Macbook, all other devices at home (Windows PC, 1 iphone, 2 ipads, 1 android, TV) connected over the same wireless network work fine and without any issues. Below is an except of &quot;netstat -an&quot; command</p><p>tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56121&nbsp; &nbsp; 85.235.246.3.443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SYN_SENT&nbsp; <br />tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56120&nbsp; &nbsp; 81.0.212.199.443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SYN_SENT&nbsp; <br />tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56119&nbsp; &nbsp; 81.0.212.199.443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SYN_SENT&nbsp; <br />tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56118&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.45.58.100.443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SYN_SENT&nbsp; <br />tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56117&nbsp; &nbsp; 173.194.112.160.443&nbsp; &nbsp; SYN_SENT&nbsp; <br />tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56116&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.45.58.100.443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SYN_SENT&nbsp; <br />tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56115&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.45.58.100.443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SYN_SENT&nbsp; <br />tcp4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 192.168.1.244.56114&nbsp; &nbsp; 17.110.230.25.443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SYN_SENT&nbsp; ]</p><p>I&#039;m running the latest Yosemite version.<br />Any idea what could be causing this? <br />Many thanks for any ideas.</p>									</div>
