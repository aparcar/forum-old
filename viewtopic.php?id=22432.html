					<p>Hi all!</p><p>Mhm, after studying for a long time and working with this router, i decided to ask all of you on the forum for some help, anything will be and is already appreciated, as this site and the main one is very great, as well as the project you are runng for years now. Now to the topic. I hace a Telme Air router. for more info what Telme is, PM me. I have fotos but not great quality, shot with nokia 6124, but it should be sufficient for info what kind of router it is. </p><p>It has:<br />CPU:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.5vtechnologies.com/product5vt1310.htm">http://www.5vtechnologies.com/product5vt1310.htm</a><br />RAM : all sites for this ram are in chinese or korean so i didnt get much info , thow it is SDRAM i think about 2-4 megs. it is CTE technologies</p><p>The question is, does OpenWRT works on any of ARM based chips (except XScale), if it does, i need some help flashing this router, i can provide all the info i can get, but i hace to be shure that Open or X WRT FW is working on ARM based SoC.</p><p>Thank you all in advance, waiting to hear from you for some advice.</p><p>rush</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>It seems that Atmel AT91 is marked broken, so you have to go to &quot;Advanced configuration options (for developers)&quot; and select &quot;Show broken platforms / packages&quot; in order to use it. Now I&#039;m trying my luck with Marvel Kirkwood (of course I&#039;m trying to adopt it to my board, all in all it seems to have less files to deal with).</p>									</div>
