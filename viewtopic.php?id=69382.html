					<p>Hello to all,</p><p>I am a newbie member and i would appreciate any help&nbsp; to my problem.</p><p>I have 2 tplinks cpe510 v.1 (not v.1.1)&nbsp; and i use them as acces point- client and with the first factory firmware all was ok for my needs because the factory firmware gave me the opportunity to choose between TEST MODE and regions mode. That means i was able to choose the transmit power to high perfomance 27db. and a lot of channels to choose from. My one tp link had a failure and i bought a new one to replace the old one. </p><p>The problem is that the new cpe510 is a different version (CPE 510 V 1.1 not ver 1 lile the old one.) and the firmware from tp link dont give the abbility to set the transmit power to high perfomance 27db but it gives maximum 17db in the setup menu. Also dont give so many channels like the old firmware. I tried to install the old firmware but there is a warning about hardware not supporting. I check the tp link firmware update page of CPE v 1.1 but there is 2 firmware wich i try but no one of them gives me&nbsp; high transmit power or the group of channels like the old one. </p><p>SO is there anyone that have or knows how can i update my firmware on cpe510 v 1.1 with a firmware that can give me the high power transmit choise to high 27db or more and a lot group of channels? I would appreciate any help or any opinion for a solution to my problem. <br />THANKS IN ADVANCE .</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nickdenick</strong> on 14 Jan 2017, 13:22)</p>

					<p>from here <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/snapshots/targets/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/snap … x/generic/</a> you download file for 510 Factory Bin Lede does not have web interface, if you need one you will have to download and install the package. via SSH (putty)<br />once done you go to OpenWrt downloads Trunk does not include web interface too, you have to download via SSH (putty) sysupgrade .Bin and install it <br />OpenWrt is like Tp-Link one file for both models</p>									</div>
