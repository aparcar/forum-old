					<p>I had not seen this documented anywhere else...</p><p>I just found out that the WRT350N router&#039;s WAN port has four pins (not the RJ-45 network pins but on the opposite side). I traced the 4 pins and confirmed that they do indeed connect to the serial pin-out inside of the router.</p><p>So anyone know where to find a RJ-45 jack has the 4 pins on the opposite side? (like the side that you push to release the jack)</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://janitha.com/images/wrt350n_closeup1_lines_thumb.jpg" alt="http://janitha.com/images/wrt350n_closeup1_lines_thumb.jpg" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://janitha.com/images/wrt350n_closeup2_lines_thumb.jpg" alt="http://janitha.com/images/wrt350n_closeup2_lines_thumb.jpg" /></span></p><p>Trackback: I will most likely post pictures here <a href="http://www.janitha.com/archives/106">http://www.janitha.com/archives/106</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dryicerx</strong> on 8 Dec 2007, 23:56)</p>

					<p>This is only true for the WRT350N v1 (USA version), the v2 (European version) doesn&#039;t have a conenctor there. Oh, just noticed, the WRT150N (v1.0) has the same pins in place, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>My aplogies for any unwanted necromancy, but I&#039;d like to find a cable for this apparent serial port. The other thread that mentioned this had a link to some cable on eBay, but the auction is long since gone and there&#039;s not even a picture left.</p>									</div>

					<p>Think about if it is really worth to spend hours to try and find such exotic piece of hardware, while it takes just about 10-15 minutes to solder some pins or wires to the internal connectors.</p>									</div>

					<p>Since I would have to buy wire and a DE-9 plug anyway, I might as well look for the specialized cable. Much neater than having to open the box, too.</p>									</div>
