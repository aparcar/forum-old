					<p>After trying to break into my router I found weakness at the end, indirect.</p><p>I use the interface in dropbear:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dropbear
        option PasswordAuth &#039;on&#039;
        option RootPasswordAuth &#039;on&#039;
        option RootLogin    &#039;on&#039;
        option Port         &#039;22&#039;
        option Interface    &#039;local&#039;</code></pre></div><p>(note: I have one more option for lan interface non-root users)</p><p>Problem is that when dopbear starts, interface &quot;local&quot; is not ready and for some reason (IMHO it&#039;s very dangerous behavior) when dropbear sees unknown interface, it understand &quot;open it for all&quot;. That means when router was restarted, port 22 was opened not only for lan, but also wan and allowed root to log in from any place.</p><p>After searching on Internet, I found following solution; create /etc/hotplug.d/iface/40-dropbear file:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;ifup&quot; ]
then
        /etc/init.d/dropbear restart
fi</code></pre></div><p>However, there is quite obvious weakness (I even didn&#039;t try to reproduce it) - in the short time, before &quot;local&quot; interface is up, port 22 is opened. For this reason, I also added firewall rules:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>firewall.@rule[X]=rule
firewall.@rule[X].target=ACCEPT
firewall.@rule[X].dest_port=22
firewall.@rule[X].name=Allow ssh/22 for localhost
firewall.@rule[X].proto=tcp udp
firewall.@rule[X].src_ip=127.0.0.1
firewall.@rule[X].dest_ip=127.0.0.1
firewall.@rule[X].src=*
firewall.@rule[Y]=rule
firewall.@rule[Y].proto=tcp udp
firewall.@rule[Y].dest_port=22
firewall.@rule[Y].name=Deny ssh/22 for anyone
firewall.@rule[Y].target=REJECT
firewall.@rule[Y].src=*</code></pre></div><p>(where X&lt;Y) which block port 22 directed on the router from all interfaces except localhost.</p><p>I left both protections (in dropbear and firewall), but I&#039;m now concerned about using the &quot;local&quot; interface at all...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Laethnes</strong> on 29 Jun 2014, 20:14)</p>

I don&#039;t expect normal people to try to access my router through wan at the time at all (in fact, I don&#039;t expect that any time), on the other hand I would expect attacker to try to exploit any security problem at start-up. AFAIK one of the weakest times of any system is start-up (and shutdown) (and when resources run out). (If I remember it correctly, this was used to hack a gaming console...) (If the attacker would be physically nearby, they would just have to turn electricity off for a second and then run some attacks...)</p><p>Other reason, why it matter to me is: what if preparing the local interface take longer for some reason? What if something happens and it won&#039;t go up at all? What if the script fails? (This is why I consider the dropbear behavior dangerous.) The firewall rules are something like insurance. Better to have two defense walls instead of one potentially failed, no?</p><p>Call me paranoid, but if I know about potential security problem - should I just leave it?</p>									</div>

I do believe that a lots of people are aware of possibility of any system to be vulnerable at start time - am I wrong?
