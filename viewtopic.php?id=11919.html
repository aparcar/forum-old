					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;m new to this kind of things so I hope you can help me with my setup.<br />I have an ADSL connection through a modem/router cascaded with a LinkSys WRT54G running OpenWrt Whiterussian.<br />I cannot easily manage port forwarding through two routers so my idea is to reconfigure the LinkSys device to simply act as a switch/access point and leave the DSL modem/router act as the only router on the network.</p><p>That should ease my port forwarding configuration.</p><p>Can you please help me with that?</p><p>Thank you all, guys.</p><p>K.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am doing this with a similar Buffalo router. What I did was disable the WAN settings and configure a static LAN address. Just use one of the LAN ports on the router as an &quot;uplink&quot; port to the rest of your LAN (you may need a cross-over cable if you do not have auto-sensing switches which can do the crossover themselves), leaving the WAN port disconnected, and the wireless will be bridged. You can connect to the router via its LAN IP address to any further administrative tasks such as changing WPA settings etc.</p>									</div>
