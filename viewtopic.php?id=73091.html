					<p>I have an issue I can&#039;t seem to figure out with alot of research. <br />How can I forward a second wired network out of the WAN port? No Vlans. No wireless (AP).</p><p>-I have the OpenWRT network x.x.1.0 (Running CC 15)<br />-Second router has x.x.2.0. <br />-Both have STATIC ROUTES that work. x.x.2.x can ping x.x.1.1 and vise versa.<br />-Second router has firewall OFF. Forwarding both networks. Even proxy arp.</p><p>I can find <strong>no</strong> supporting documentation, tutorials, examples, forum posts etc on this.<br />All I found was info for AP Guest networks and Vlan trunking. I&#039;m using <em>neither</em>.<br />I don&#039;t need DHCP or DNS on 2nd network. I can forward out to ISP DNS and DHCP is covered by router2.</p><p>I&#039;m not iptables savvy and don&#039;t want to break my OpenWRT WAN settings. Seems I can only have a direct-connect interfaces as a ZONE so I can&#039;t use the GUI for this.</p><p>ROUTER1 <br />me@OpenWrt:~# route -n<br />Destination&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gateway&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Genmask&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flags Metric Ref&nbsp; &nbsp; Use Iface<br />0.0.0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ISP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0.0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UG&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 eth0<br />ISP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.224.0&nbsp; &nbsp;U&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 eth0<br />ISP&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.255.255 UH&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 eth0<br />192.168.1.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0.0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.255.0&nbsp; &nbsp;U&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 br-lan<br />192.168.2.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.250&nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.255.0&nbsp; &nbsp;UG&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 br-lan &lt;&lt; STATIC ROUTE</p><p>cat /etc/config/network<br />config route &lt;&lt; STATIC ROUTE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;192.168.2.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;192.168.1.250&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option metric &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mtu &#039;1500&#039;</p><p>me@OpenWrt:~# ping -c1 192.168.2.233 &lt; DHCP on x.x.2.0 network<br />PING 192.168.2.233 (192.168.2.233): 56 data bytes<br />64 bytes from 192.168.2.233: seq=0 ttl=127 time=0.887 ms WORKS<br />--------------<br />ROUTER 2<br />me@Router2:~$ show ip route<br />Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, O - OSPF,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I - ISIS, B - BGP, &gt; - selected route, * - FIB route</p><p>S&gt;* 0.0.0.0/24 [1/0] via 192.168.1.1, eth0 &lt; STATIC ROUTE &amp; DEFAULT GATEWAY<br />C&gt;* 127.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, lo<br />C&gt;* 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, eth0<br />C&gt;* 192.168.2.0/24 is directly connected, switch0<br />----------------------</p><p>2nd network client<br />x.x.2.233&gt;ping -n1 192.168.1.1 <br />Sent=1, Received =1, Lost = 0 (0% Loss) WORKS<br />--------------<br />1st network client<br />x.x.1.30&gt;ping 192.168.2.233<br />Packets: Sent = 2, Received = 2, Lost = 0 (0% loss), WORKS</p><p>But x.x.2.0 network can&#039;t go out to the Internet.<br />Please help if you can.

Certainly not in the gui. Or supported. I&#039;m trying to avoid sub-interfaces and vlans and all the trunking fun. But if it&#039;s necessary. But does it solve the original problem?</p><p>Router treats the other stub network as foreign. It&#039;s routing it. Just dropping it instead of NATing.</p><p>It&#039;s not clear why a Router OS is so focused on being an Access Point with little to no mention of actual <em>routing</em>.<br />Is users having another wired network so rare in the life-time of OpenWRT?
