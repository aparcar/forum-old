					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently bought asus wl-500g and installed firmware <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd â€¦ s2-4MB.trx</a>.<br />Every time I try to download bigger files (over 100 MB), router reboots. Usually I get less than 30 MB before transfer stalls, sometimes it goes as far as 80 MB.This only happens when using pppoe protocol and only when I&#039;m downloading big files. Uploading works fine. (I tested it by sending 700 MB file. 10/10 times it completed OK with speed 1.1 MB/s) I have redirected system logs to remote host and I&#039;m running pppd in debug mode, but there&#039;s nothing special written in syslog at the time of reboot (just normal boot messages). I have also tried to reproduce this situation in my home network, with static IP associated to WAN port. I have been transferring big files back and forth without problems so i think something in pppoe is causing reboots.</p><p>here&#039;s some (hopefully) relevant NVRAM entries :</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/etc/ppp# nvram show | grep ppp<br />size: 967 bytes (31801 left)<br />ppp_passwd=*******<br />ppp_username=*********<br />pppoe_mtu=1492<br />wan_proto=pppoe<br />pppoe_ifname=eth1<br />pppoe_passwd=*****<br />pppoe_username=*************<br />wan_ifname=ppp0<br />ppp_mtu=1492<br />pppoe_mru=1492</p><p>In the beginning of CHAP authentication there&#039;s syslog entries like this :</p><p>Nov 21 17:58:51 192.168.1.1&nbsp; pppd[292]: Couldn&#039;t increase MTU to 1500<br />Nov 21 17:58:51 192.168.1.1&nbsp; : Couldn&#039;t increase MTU to 1500<br />Nov 21 17:58:51 192.168.1.1&nbsp; pppd[292]: Couldn&#039;t increase MRU to 1500<br />Nov 21 17:58:51 192.168.1.1&nbsp; : Couldn&#039;t increase MRU to 1500</p><p>but authentication succeeds and everythings is working fine until incoming traffic gets too heavy.<br />I have searched forum and read the documentation, faq and logs but looks like this isn&#039;t too common problem.<br />Well, I found this : <br /><a href="http://www.macsat.com/forum/index.php?topic=83.0">http://www.macsat.com/forum/index.php?topic=83.0</a><br />but I&#039;ve already done that so any help is much appreciated.</p><p>Atso</p>									</div>
