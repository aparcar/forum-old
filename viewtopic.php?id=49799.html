					<p>Hi, I have recently upgraded my BB to r40295 and the result is I have only about half of the signal I had previously with r39xxx. The signal is very weak even with jow&#039;s reghack installed and raised txpower when comparing to previous version. Anyone has idea what went wrong? I will have to try to return to older release, if it will be better. Router: tp link tl wr841n v8.</p>									</div>
