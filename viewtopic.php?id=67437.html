					<p>I don&#039;t know anything about webgui, because I don&#039;t use it, but openwrt does not use admin, but root ;-) Telnet is disabled once you set up password with passwd command, which then works in combination with root username via ssh. Are you sure you have openwrt installed?</p>									</div>

					<p>Username should default to &quot;root&quot;. Password (which sounds like you already set one) is the same one you use to log into the gui. If you didn&#039;t set a password, then there is no password, since OpenWrt doesn&#039;t come with a default password. In this case, just press enter on the password entry (and I would set a password after successful login).</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK, this device comes with OpenWrt pre-installed, and most presumably pre-configured; however, all the advice about usernames and passwords above applies to the standard OpenWrt configuration only.</p><p>Since this seems like a problem with Sitecom&#039;s configuration, I guess you should ask them for support.</p>									</div>
