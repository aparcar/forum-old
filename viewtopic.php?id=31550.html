					<p>I sometimes use filezilla ftp client to edit config files such as &quot;network&quot; and &quot;wireless&quot;</p><p>Since switching from Webif to LuCi I often get uci &quot;failure to read config file&quot; error messages if I edit them using filezilla which uses Windows &quot;Write&quot; program. Write offers to &quot;save as&quot; in several txt formats including msdos and unicode formats. What file format is LuCi using when it edits the config files?</p><p>I have been using the router&#039;s &quot;nano&quot; editor to make some changes and it has solved the issue with LuCi but it would be nice to be able to use filezilla and Write.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem here is most likely the difference between cr/lf and just lf<br />Windows wants to put cr/lf or chr(13) and chr(10) at the end of every line, *nix only wants lf or chr(10)<br />Since you&#039;re having this problem I&#039;ll assume you&#039;re using a windows system.<br />Visit <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/</a>&nbsp; and download the windows version and then change your settings in filezilla to use it as your default text editor. That should solve the problem for you.</p><p>It is nice using filezilla to just edit right in ftp <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
