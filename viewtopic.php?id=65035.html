					<p>Hi, <br />I&#039;m trying to use a recompiled version of hostapd (v2.5, downloaded from the website and cross compiled) with a very minor patch (commenting out a single line that causes all wireless devices to disconnect on configuration changes).</p><p>I installed my cross compiled version of hostapd on the router and it was missing some dependencies (such as librt) but I solved that and got hostapd to run. I copied my new hostapd binary to the /usr/sbin folder under a new name and changed the symlink between hostapd and wpad to point to my new hostapd. (I&#039;m also not sure what this wpad is, that might be related to the issue I&#039;m having)</p><p>How when I try to run hostapd with the same configuration file as before I get the following lines:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# /usr/sbin/hostapd -P /var/run/wifi-phy0.pid -B /var/run/hostapd-phy0.conf 
Configuration file: /var/run/hostapd-phy0.conf

7 errors found in configuration file &#039;/var/run/hostapd-phy0.conf&#039;
Failed to set up interface with /var/run/hostapd-phy0.conf
Failed to initialize interface</code></pre></div><p>The lines that were in the code that correspond to those errors are:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ieee80211n=1

					<p>You either fix the scripts which setup hostapd to not add stuff hostapd knows nothing about or you add your patch on top to of the invasive openwrt ones.</p><p>Also you seem to not have enabled all you need in your hostapd build (n/ac support).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Niv,<br />Have you found the solution to the problems? I hit into similar problems when trying to recompile hostapd since I need a certain feature called disable_dgaf there. Thanks!</p><p>Regards,<br />Rahmadi</p>									</div>

					<p>I have found the answer to this problem:</p><p>1) Basically I rebuilt the hostapd package by downloading the source code from OpenWrt GitHub.<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/</a><br />I took the Chaos Calmer branch.</p><p>2) Then I just followed the instructions to build just one package from here:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howtobuild/single.package">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howtobuild/single.package</a></p><p>3) Then I made sure that all the dependencies are followed for hostapd. Please refer to the Makefile:<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob</a> â€¦ d/Makefile<br />PKG_CONFIG_DEPENDS:= \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_WPA_SUPPLICANT_NO_TIMESTAMP_CHECK \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-ath9k \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-cfg80211 \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_hostapd \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_hostapd-mini \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-hostap \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_WPA_RFKILL_SUPPORT \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_DRIVER_WEXT_SUPPORT \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_DRIVER_11N_SUPPORT</p><p>Make sure that all of these are enabled in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; or just edit &quot;.config&quot; file directly.<br />Basically after all the setup we type: &quot;make package/hostapd/compile&quot;. And we&#039;ll get the required .ipk.</p>									</div>
