					<p>So I couldn&#039;t help but notice that Attitude Adjustment is slated to have a 3.3 kernel, but the 3.2 and 3.4 kernels are the ones that are marked &#039;longterm&#039; at kernel.org, meaning that 3.3 is no longer going to be patched. Also, distributions seem to be using 3.2, 3.4, or the &#039;current&#039; release because they want to continue to get bug/security/performance fixes.</p><p>Considering that the OpenWRT images end up on devices that might not get touched frequently and have 5+ year lifetimes, wouldn&#039;t it be prudent to use only &#039;longterm&#039; kernels?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re concerned about security, I personally would be more concerned about application software (&quot;packages&quot;) installed on the device. At least in my experience, there are more security flaws of significance in that software than there are in the kernel.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt does not use in-kernel wifi drivers, we use compat-wireless plus backports, so the stack is even more current than whatever you find in the most recent stable kernel.</p>									</div>

					<p>Plus, they way things seem to be going, there is a bloat-war going on with the kernel. openWRT no longer fits: then a cunning dev declutters the kernel: then a minor rebuild bloats the kernel again.</p>									</div>
