					<p>Hi all,</p><p>i&#039;m quiet busy theese days and would like to share my last efforts in providing another tool to help build and provide packages in a more convenient way.</p><p>The idea is to provide a tool that is able to build packages locally (almost) anywhere from (almost) nothing, just knowing a source name.</p><p>I made a little <a href="http://nthill.free.fr/openwrt/src/ipkg/ipkgb.README">HOWTO/README</a> available, just take a look, i&#039;m waiting for your feedback...</p><br /><p>--<br />Nico</p>									</div>

					<p>I have some reservations with depending on download locations for package building. Just consider the problems people have with changing locations in the current OpenWRT buildroot already. Aside from that, it&#039;s not a bad idea, except maybe for the implementation.</p><p>How about this:</p><p>- Create a build directory, cd into it<br />- Download a top level Makefile from a location<br />- Set an environment variable to the OpenWRT buildroot<br />- type &#039;make&#039;</p><p>The Makefile only downloads the original source, it downloads the patch to create an ipkg directory (with everything in it), and it kicks off ipkg-buildpackage -c. Done. Together with what I already have, constructing such a (skeleton) toplevel Makefile only would take about 5 minutes work.</p><p>The top level makefile should contain everything it needs to download, patch and build the package. No need for an unsupported, non standard extension of the ipkg control file, and there&#039;s no need for yet another script to parse the Control file to do stuff. Nor is there a need for yet another packaging directory.</p>									</div>

Ask the debian guys :-)</p><p>Your point #1 is easily solved, as you yourself already wrote. #2 is a bit trickier as that is really a limitation in the ipkg utils. It can be added into the toolchain, sure, and I for one would really appreciate it. However, I don&#039;t really have the time to look into it too deeply. #3 is indeed a complex issue, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s one which can be solved easily. It&#039;s not too hard to hack some halfassed solution with a script or a makefile (simply chain a truckload of package builds together), but it&#039;ll never be something which will work well.</p><p>I think it would be best to first get a good idea which problem you want to solve. Is it to make it easy for people to reproduce packages you made? Is it to make your life as software package easier when packaging new stuff? Or for maintaining your existing set of packages easier? Is it to make it easier for people to package their own software? </p><p>I&#039;m a bit confused as to what goal it is you want to reach. I suspect you want to create an easy way for people to build a package, including its dependencies from scratch with only buildroot available.</p>									</div>

					<p>just try it to build ez-ipupdate and works fine(of course as you have that in your repository). Just a minor note, you use &quot;sed -i&quot; which is not a valid opt on my machine which happens to be debian woody. I need to update sed for it. May be a note in the readme ?</p>									</div>

					<p>BTW, can this tools used to build kernel modules outside the vanilla kernel, such as alsa ? I just bought a WL500G which has a USB port and I want to test the possibility of using a bluetooth headset as the audio device on it. Unfortunately, there is no oss driver for bluetooth and only alsa.</p><p>There may be other kernel modules as well like webcam etc.</p>									</div>
