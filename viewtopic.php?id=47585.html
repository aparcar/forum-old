					<p>Hello there folks, seems there have been MANY posts on how to get VPN working on newer versions of OpenWRT and Gargoyle, and nothing really worked for me, no matter what I tried.&nbsp; I finally found a combination of changes that ended up getting me internet access over VPN. </p><p>What I did to get PPTP VPN working on Gargoyle 1.5.11</p><p>First, install the packages via SSH (terminal or PuTTY)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install pptpd kmod-mppe</code></pre></div><p>Then you need to enable the PPTP server to start on boot<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/pptpd enable</code></pre></div><p>And of course, start it up one good time<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/pptpd start</code></pre></div><p>At this point, the server is running, but there are no user accounts/creds, and the server config is at default.</p><p>Let&#039;s add some users first<br />Use your favorite text editor to modify /etc/ppp/chap-secrets<br />I used nano, which is a terminal/shell-based text app.<br />Example </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nano /etc/ppp/chap-secrets</code></pre></div><p>Once you&#039;ve opened the file, you should see the default<br />&quot;#username provider password ipaddress&quot; at the top, letting you know<br />you&#039;ve accessed the right file.&nbsp; Use format mentioned.<br />Example: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>IamAuser MYSERVER potatoes123 192.168.1.200</code></pre></div><p>In the example above, I put &quot;MYSERVER&quot; as the provider, this will be the name<br />of the server as you set it to be in just a minute, so pick something you&#039;ll<br />want as your server name, with no spaces.</p><p>Keep in mind, the IP at the end should be an address that&#039;s outside of the<br />DHCP range.&nbsp; Example, your router&#039;s DHCP server is set to provide IP&#039;s automatically<br />and will pick a number between 2 and 200 (192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.200), so pick a<br />number like 192.168.1.201 or higher.&nbsp; Obviously your range can be different, and router&#039;s<br />IP may be different too, so adjust as necessary.</p><p>Okay, after that&#039;s done, save changes (Ctrl + O if using nano, and press enter to save, then Ctrl + X to exit).</p><p>We now need to modify our server to what specifications we need set.&nbsp; Use nano or text editor of choice<br />and open up /etc/ppp/options.pptpd and you should see a line that says &quot;172.16.1.1:&quot;.&nbsp; This is the<br />default server IP address, and it CAN be changed.&nbsp; I recommend using the same IP as your router though,<br />if you plan on making life easy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> having your VPN server in the same network IP configuration saves<br />a bunch of headache when it comes time to access not only the internet, but local computers on the <br />router&#039;s network. </p><p>My configuration modifies the following:<br />172.16.1.1: &gt;&gt; 222.222.2.2 (my router&#039;s IP)<br />name &quot;pptpd-server&quot; &gt;&gt; name &quot;TRYPMYNE&quot;<br />#ms-dns &gt;&gt; ms-dns 8.8.8.8 (Google&#039;s DNS server)<br />And add &quot;proxyarp&quot; on another line (without quotes, of course)</p><p>Save changes to the file, and we move on to another configuration file.</p><p>Theoretically, /etc/ppp/options.pptpd is supposed to handle everything that<br />/etc/pptpd.conf does, but I couldn&#039;t get a network connection at all unless I<br />modified it to use localip and remoteip.&nbsp; I added the following lines:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>localip 222.222.2.2 #(your router&#039;s IP, this is mine)
remoteip 222.222.2.230-250 #(sets range for IP&#039;s that are given by VPN, these are mine)</code></pre></div><p>Of course, save changes to this file as well.&nbsp; One that&#039;s done, there&#039;s only one thing<br />left to do, and quite frankly, it&#039;s what gave me the most headaches.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure all<br />of it&#039;s necessary, but it <strong>WORKS</strong>, and that&#039;s all I care about <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Open up the user firewall settings, which are located at /etc/firewall.user<br />The default lines are as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># This file is interpreted as shell script.
# Put your custom iptables rules here, they will
# be executed with each firewall (re-)start.</code></pre></div><p>But there will be no entries, unless you&#039;ve modified this file before.&nbsp; Add the following<br />lines to the file (copy and paste works wonders):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables    -A input_wan -p tcp --dport 1723 -j ACCEPT
iptables    -A input_wan -p gre -j ACCEPT

iptables    -A output_rule -p 47 -j ACCEPT
iptables    -A input_rule -p 47 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A input_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding_rule -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A output_rule -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT

/usr/sbin/iptables -A input_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
/usr/sbin/iptables -A output_rule -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT
/usr/sbin/iptables -A forwarding_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT </code></pre></div><p>And of course, save changes to this as well <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />But wait, there&#039;s more!<br />We need to modify /etc/config/firewall too!<br />Go ahead and open the file up, there will be multiple lines here, so scroll to the bottom<br />and when you&#039;re there, add an extra line break, and copy/paste this (or manually type):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;rule&#039;
    option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option &#039;_name&#039; &#039;pptpd&#039;
    option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;tcpudp&#039;
    option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;1723&#039;
    option &#039;family&#039; &#039;ipv4&#039;
    option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039; </code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />And of course, save changes to the file and get out of it.&nbsp; One last change that needs to be made here.<br />If using Gargoyle, go under the firewall and add a manual port forward entry for port 1723, and have<br />it forward to your router&#039;s IP (example: my router&#039;s IP is 222.222.2.2, so forward to 222.222.2.2). Name<br />it whatever you want, I just named mine VPN.&nbsp; After this, save changes to the firewall.</p><p>Worst case you can&#039;t get the above to work, add this to your /etc/config/firewall file too,<br />remembering to change the &quot;dest_ip&quot; to your router&#039;s IP:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect &#039;redirect_enabled_number_99&#039;
    option name &#039;VPN&#039;
    option src &#039;wan&#039;
    option dest &#039;lan&#039;
    option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
    option src_dport &#039;1723&#039;
    option dest_ip &#039;222.222.2.2&#039;
    option dest_port &#039;1723&#039; </code></pre></div><p>Last, but not least, reboot the router so it reloads all the needed files!</p><p>Once rebooted, give a shot at connecting to your VPN.&nbsp; It should work from the outside now!&nbsp; If connecting<br />from Windows, it should provide proper IP&#039;s, and register &quot;Internet access&quot;.&nbsp; If not, double check what you&#039;ve<br />done on your config files, and reboot router after all changes have been made <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Hopefully this worked for all of you, it certanly helped me get VPN working so I can use RDP as well as Samba<br />shares on my network while I&#039;m out and about.&nbsp; Hope this helps y&#039;all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TrYp.MyNe</strong> on 27 Nov 2013, 23:39)</p>
