					<p>Hi, </p><p>I&#039;ve got and Encore Networks EN4000 router (running OpenWrt)<br />WAN port connected to my LAN managed by a linksys router.</p><p>The ip address of the EN4000 WAN port is 192.168.1.251 (static)<br />and its default gateway (my linksys router) is 192.168.1.254</p><p>My PC is connected through the LAN ports of this router&nbsp; (EN4000) giving me the following info<br />ip 192.168.1.232 (DHCP)<br />and default gateway 192.168.1.3 </p><p>I can access the GUI (LuCI) of the EN4000 through my pc which is connected directly to the LAN port of the EN4000 using the ip 192.168.1.3 in my browser (EN4000 LANs port)</p><br /><p>My problem is the following: <br />I have another computer connected directly to the linksys router butI&#039;m NOT able to access the en4000 through my browser using ip 192.168.1.251. (EN4440 WANs port)<br />ANYONE KNOWS WHY? how can I access the GUI of the router through the WAN port?, <br />I actually was previously able to do this so I know it is possible but I&#039;m really not sure what I changed that make it stop. I&#039;ve tryed changing the ip address but I&#039;m not even able to access when configured as DHCP instead of Static IP. </p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
