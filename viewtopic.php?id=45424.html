I used them to get back to a working system.

The original firmware shipped and pre-installed from Buffalo is the dd-wrt called &quot;Professional&quot;. What was going wrog was what I referred to by &quot;other methods&quot; menaing the many ways I tried flashing openwrt to it. Using tftp, mtd etc etc. The end result of flashing the openwrt always was a red solid diag light .</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I used tftp to flash tftp.bin and I used mtd method to flash both jffs and squashfs and waited at least 30 minutes or longer for each flashing to finnish.

I had tried ssh and not telnet so when I tried telnet again today. I found that even though the normal lights weren&#039;t on and only the red diag light was on , the router actually worked. <br />So all that remains is to find how to set the LED&#039;s for this router to NOT show diag when it actually works!</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Anything I can do to identify my model any better?</p></blockquote></div><div class="quotebox"><cite>mazilo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Usually, the model of a router is well written on the back of the router.

But seeing that it actually does, means all is well. Well, almost. It is not very helpful to have it boot up with the red diag light staying on permanently.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ursrau</strong> on 26 Jul 2013, 00:21)</p>

					<p>When you login into your router running on an OpenWRT firmware, you can runa <em>logread</em> to see what Linux kernel messages and look for your hardware revision. Also a <em>cat /proc/cpuinfo</em> may reveal something, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Mazilo<br />Thanks for your feedback. Looks like the only issue is that the router reboots into a permanent red diag light.<br />Which meant I assumed something had gone wrong. Just like you assumed upon hearing about the solid red diag light.<br />What&#039;s my next step? Should I raise a bug or ticket , so this get&#039;s fixed and other people don&#039;t assume their flashes failed as well, when in fact they worked?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have&nbsp; started a new topic on this, as the topic of this thread is no long accurate. It&#039;s not the flashing that fails.
