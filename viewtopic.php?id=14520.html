					<p>WRT54g3g-st&nbsp; for U.S. Sprint CDMA</p><p>It&#039;s been working with my Sierra Aircard 580 1xEV-DO but heard a lot of OpenWRT....</p><p>I Successfully installed the WhiteRussian .9 but wasn&#039;t able to get it working and I saw some logs entries not looking right. </p><p>Decided, OK let&#039;s apply Kamikaze 7.09, Did that and can now Telnet to my new BusyBox....</p><p>I&#039;m not able to decipher all that I have read to make any progress though. Seems GSM is better covered.</p><p>The long term goal was to get this working with some form of QOS, to support VoIP SIP phones with mobility...</p><p>I&#039;m not interested in Bricking this thing, but I think I&#039;m very close... Any suggested to try would be helpful...</p><p>Also I suspect the chicken in me says, what&#039;s the most direct path back to the Sprint Firmware?</p><p>I had tried it from the White russian, and got a error saying I needed a TRX file, not the Bin file..</p><p>Cheers...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>andrewgroup</strong> on 14 Feb 2008, 21:50)</p>
