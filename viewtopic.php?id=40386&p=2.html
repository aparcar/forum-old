					<p>I have written NCM protocol support for openwrt - allowing newer usb dongles, that use ncm instead of ppp to provide broadband. <br />I designed system as modular, therefor, drivers/at-command sets can be added.<br />Currently I have provided only support for device that I have: huawei e3276 but it is pretty easy to add support for other ncm dongles as well. Unfortunately, &quot;status&quot; page is set to support only ncm devices at the moment, as it needs a serial TTY of modem for communication and fetches it from network/wan configuration and checks that used protocol is ncm. Although, one can pretty easily to make changes to this..<br />Additional packages provide:<br />- at-command set support for Huawei e3276 (full support: initscript, mode setting, connection initiation, carrier info, cell info, signal info)<br />- protocol support for luci. Allows fast/easy setup in luci.<br />- ncm status for luci: visible dongle stats in luci, including hardware information, current mode, carrier, cell and signal information.</p><p>Code uses only comgt and shell scripts, so it&#039;s universal. No any binaries are provided/needed. Package is not made dependant on usb-modeswitcher, but your dongle most propably is (just giving a hint here) - User must handle modeswitching manually. Also on my setup, I had to add vendorid:productid of switched device to /etc/modules.d/usb-serial (usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1506)</p><p>If not chosen otherwise, interface is brough up/connected automaticly on boot, or when device is connected to USB port.</p><p>Here is image of setup:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/20uc1i1.png" alt="ncm luci setup" /></span></p><p>And here is a screenshot of status:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/n2bfkn.png" alt="ncm luci status" /></span></p><p>---</p><p>My work can be patched to current trunk tree from patch available at here: <a href="http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/4474/">http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/4474/</a></p><p>And packages are available at: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/variousopenwrt/huawei-e3267">https://sites.google.com/site/variousop … awei-e3267</a><br />They are compiled for Netgear WNDR3700 - but my project is just bunch of scripts, therefore, architechture independant and work on all openwrt devices that can meat the dependancies.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jake1981</strong> on 28 Nov 2013, 16:36)</p>

					<p>I have a dongle related question about getting the Operator from the hardware.</p><p>I am using a Huawei EM820U Pcei card.</p><p>When I run AT +COPS? I get a response that has the carrier name as:</p><p>+COPS: 0,2,&quot;54720&quot;,2</p><p>The operator being:&nbsp; 54720</p><p>I would prefer to get the actual name of the provider.</p><p>Is this an issue wtih the device, or is there some way to trasnlate this code into a name?</p><p>I looked at the scripts mentioned in this thread, and it seems they are just using the return value from COPS, so perhaps it is a limitation of the 820U?</p><p>Any help or pointers would be great.&nbsp; Thank you.</p><br /><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I solved this issue by issuing the command: &quot;AT +COPS=0,0,,&quot;</p><p>This tells the Huawei modem to return the text string instead of the numeric value.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JohnV</strong> on 28 Aug 2014, 23:48)</p>
