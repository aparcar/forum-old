					<p>I&#039;ve got a Belkin F5D8230-4 v1000, which has the broadcom 4704 processor and airgo card. I&#039;ve got openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx on it and ssh is running. I have not tested the wireless ... and am not sure I will, as I want to use this router as a tiny server on my work LAN.</p><p>There is an amazing lack of information about these identical pre-N routers, so I thought I&#039;d share some of what I&#039;ve learned... </p><p>How I tftp&#039;d:<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16613">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16613</a><br />I literally did exactly like as quoted (as not working) at the top. I scammed my gf&#039;s XP laptop and set up the wired NIC, did the 10msec ping and had the other window with tfpt. It took me probably 20 tries and then it took openWrt.</p><br /><p>Useful links:<br />The Belkin F5D8230-4 = wrt54GX thread:<br /><a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,13874867~start=20">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark, … 7~start=20</a></p><p>Note: I did exactly this: I installed the linksys firmware and was hoping to use it to upload openWrt (or another os) but it wouldn&#039;t accept any firmwares via its webif. Not even the belkin firmware with the linksys header! But I did get tftp to work (as mentioned above)</p><p>Awesome dd-wrt thread about gpio pins on the f5d8230-4:<br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=29520&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=75">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. … p;start=75</a><br />(with pics)</p><p>popular WRT54 ping exploit that didn&#039;t work for me on the F5D8230-4:<br /><a href="http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=31763&amp;page=3">http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showt … amp;page=3</a></p><p>Hope this helps someone... I&#039;ll post more as I learn more.<br /><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Chris</p>									</div>
