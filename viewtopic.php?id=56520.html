					<p>Hi,</p><p>here my experience:<br />Asked for an account to be able to use an IPv6 OpenVPN tunnel from my android phone or laptop to my OpenVPN server running on my OpenWRT box.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&gt; Dear XX,
&gt;
&gt; SixXS has experienced a problem verifying the account information
&gt; you provided during your signup.
&gt;
&gt; The reason specified was:
&gt;    SixXS does not support OpenVPN
&gt;
&gt; The result is that your account has been marked disabled.
...</code></pre></div><p>OK, explained, what I want to do</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Hi,

I just want to tunnel over OpenVPN with IPv6 as transportation protocol from my mobile device to my OpenVPN Server running in my home at an IPv6 internet connection.
Therefore my mobile device needs IPv6 connectivity.
It is not neccessary that SixXS supports OpenVPN.
I Just need udp port 1194 connection from my mobile device to my home-router over IPv6.

Please be so kind and check this again.

Thanks
XX</code></pre></div><p>Last:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I need IPv6 connectivity on my mobile android device to gain access to
&gt;
&gt; IPv6 Internet Sites
&gt; Remote Access to my IPv6 home-network
&gt; Getting experience with to coming technology
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately my mobile phone provider does not support IPv6 yet.
&gt;
&gt; Please be so kind and check my account again.

Your signup reason was:

&quot;Enabling android v6 connectivity to build an ipv6 tunnel to an openvpn
server.&quot;

Please elaborate, noting that we do not provide OpenVPN based tunnels.</code></pre></div><p>This is really annoying.<br />Especially cause I gave them my personal data to request the account and do not know, what they are doing with them. <br />But now I gave up.<br />And I want to warn others.</p><p>So now my questions:<br />How are your experiences?<br />Are there alternatives?<br />I know HE.NET as a very fair tunnelbroker. But HE.NET requires a public (pingable) v4 adress for the tunnel.<br />But this is normally not available in WiFi or LTE networks.<br />Other hints are welcome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>riodoro</strong> on 28 Mar 2015, 17:27)</p>

					<p>You can use Miredo/Tiredo?

					<p>Thanks for your hint. I will check that.<br />The reason for OpenVPN is:<br />Secure and encrypted access to my home network.<br />Tunneling v4 traffic through a v6 OpenVPN tunnel.<br />There a some devices in my home network that are only v4 capable.</p><p>edit:<br />teredo/miredo is obvisualy not available for android phones.<br />Do you have any other ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>riodoro</strong> on 28 Mar 2015, 18:52)</p>

					<p>My experience with sixxs: it requires a special daemon running on your router, it is fast and easy to install and configure, but I think it is not completely integrated into OpenWrt (it requires both an internet connection and a correct time to work, but the scrip does not take that into account, the daemon starts too soon, and fails).</p><p>I decided to try Hurricane Electric (<a href="https://www.tunnelbroker.net/">https://www.tunnelbroker.net/</a>): took me five minutes to set up everything, and it works perfectly.</p>									</div>
