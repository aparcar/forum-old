					<p>I am running an OLSR OpenWRT mesh network using various WRT54G models and Ubiquiti M2 HP Bullets.</p><p>The mesh runs as an adhoc network; all of the mesh nodes broadcast the same SSID.</p><p>Is it possible for each device (WRT54G or Bullet) to broadcast two SSIDs simultaneously, the adhoc mesh SSID and an Access Point (AP) SSID?</p><p>I do NOT wish to use the AP to do anything other than broadcast a unique name - the mesh node host name -&nbsp; that is visible to tools such as InSSIDer.

					<p>Thank you for the b43 explanation.</p><p>This may be entirely bogus, but.... using dd-wrt I have successfully created WRT54G Access Points with two simultaneous SSIDs.

Regardless of how many nodes are active, assuming they are actually associated and meshed, they all use the same BSSID and there is only a single entry in InSSIDer. The true MAC address does not show for any of the mesh nodes.</p><p>The reason I want each node to have a second SSID is so each one will broadcast a unique SSID, in addition to the mesh SSID. For example, if I have 5 nodes on a mesh (and all are close enough to my computer running InSSIDer that they can be &quot;seen&quot; directly)&nbsp; I want to see 6 entries in InSSIDer: one mesh SSID (MAC showing as BSSID) and 5 node SSIDs (MAC showing as the actual MAC).</p><p>****</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>qasdfdsaq wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Most drivers allow you to have more than one AP on openwrt.

The second adhoc SSID seems to either suppress the first (mesh) adhoc SSID or prevents the mesh from working.</p><p>I tried using an AP as the second SSID because it appeared that two adhocs would not work.</p><p>Does anyone know if running two adhocs on the same box is possible? One adhoc needs to work properly with the mesh, the other needs to do nothing other than beacon an SSID.</p>									</div>
