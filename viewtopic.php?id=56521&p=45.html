					<p>Thing is this:&nbsp; <br />On the AVM site all the 7170 firmwares are FON, there seems no non fon in existence.&nbsp; <br />The reduced model of the 7170 without fon goes by the type 3170.</p><p>I&#039;m not convinced.&nbsp; I&#039;m also not sure that I&#039;m correct.&nbsp; </p><p>The 7170 wiki page (without fon) <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/avm/fritz.box.wlan.7170">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/avm/fritz.box.wlan.7170</a> <br />does not have pictures. Aan google can&#039;t seem to tell the difference between any fritzbox.<br />I can&#039;t find any picture that can convince me that a 7170 without Fon or without WLAN exists. <br />Or is say that wrong: the reduced version of is named 3170 so it does exist but it has a different type number</p><p>So if that is true then the 7170 fon (without WLAN) wiki page should not exist. <br />And it confuses by saying that 7170 is not supported by OpenWRT and that&#039;s incorrect since it is partly supported. I made that mistake a few months ago when i first looked at OpenWRT.&nbsp; searched for 7170 fount that page and threw the 7170 aside, now i&#039;m more familiar with the wiki it turns out to be partly supported . So thats great! </p><p>So this is why i can&#039;t let go... I want to be sure so that others don&#039;t have to make that mistake.</p><p>If someone owns a 7170 Fon without WLAN <br />then please make a few pictures of all sides. (also the bottom with the type sticker) I&#039;m pretty sure it will say 3170 (not 7170)</p><p>There is however another difference:<br />there is an Annex A and a Annex B version of the 7170 but both have WLAN</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frietpan</strong> on 4 Sep 2015, 23:08)</p>

					<p>I think making the barrier low enough is one thing, it is already pretty low, but maybe also FUD? <br />I&#039;m also new to this, but i go and have a look and give it a try. And come back here to ask if something is not clear.</p><p>The wiki seemed a bit unclear at first but with some patience i will manage. But does everyone have the patience to figure it out?&nbsp; What kind of people should edit the wik?&nbsp; Only die-hard text editors?&nbsp; For the wiki i expected more of a WYSIWYG editor. Specially since that is more easy for non/less technical people. </p><p>I&#039;m all new here so i don&#039;t know how all of it came to be.&nbsp; And i don&#039;t know how much work it already was to build this big wiki. But i&#039;m sure that the lower the barrier is to edit a wiki the more people will go and edit.<br />Not sure HOW to make it easy for everyone. I can imagine that a WYSIWYG can be a headache for many other reasons.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ll try to keep the question in mind and think of ways to get more help from &#039;us&#039;.</p><p>I guess asking people to ask questions about the wiki is also an option to gain insight.</p><p>Or ask the community in a new topic things like:<br />What would it take to get more people editing the wiki?<br />Why don&#039;t you edit the wiki?<br />Are there questions you didn&#039;t dare to ask?<br />What should be improved, and how would you improve it? (And why didn&#039;t you?)</p><p>Maybe in a more political way, and not all at once.</p><p>I&#039;m sure more people want to help. But some might need some help to to start helping?&nbsp; That also will take effort.&nbsp; </p><p>I recently made my first edits in the wiki Tiny edits, so that I make 1 step at a time, and if I make a mistake it can&#039;t be a big one. Easy to remember what I did, even with a sleepy head....</p><p>And what about a task list?<br />Big tasks<br />Little tasks<br />Devs like to know X, Y, Z, of device 1 and 2, or devices that have a certain chipset...</p><p>An idea box? Even if idea&#039;s never get used, it is never bad to have idea&#039;s collected. Then you see what is on peoples minds.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking out loud, so I may think stupid thoughts, but that’s ok if someone else can turn them into a brilliant idea, and run naked trough the streets shouting EUREKA!!</p>									</div>

(For example, all the sticky items in the Community documentation forum are &gt; 18 months old, and don&#039;t seem particularly relevant to anything people are doing today.)</p><p>- Update the &quot;OpenWrt Wiki - Maintenance&quot; sticky topic to say, &quot;Help us maintain the OpenWrt Wiki&quot;, then list concrete tasks/steps people can do. </p><p>On the Wiki:</p><p>- List specific tasks that people can do to take advantage of the new ToH. Tell how to add datatables to the detail page, etc.</p><p>- Making sure the wiki pages that let people know exactly what to do, so that they can just follow our instructions to &quot;do the right thing&quot;. (I realize that sometimes I get too detailed, and that puts a lot of people off... Someone else can check and bring me up short :-)</p><p>- I am still not content with the topnote of the current ToH. The table of variations takes up too much space, meaning that people may not see the &quot;good stuff&#039; unless they scroll. </p><p>I realize this is a lot of writing, and I will volunteer for some. Anyone else want to help?</p>									</div>
