					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am working on a project with custom hardware, and the openwrt firmware covers a lot of what we require (I have been using the standard buildroot platform from buildroot.org for my build environment until now), but I like a lot of the features included in the openwrt build tree.</p><p>Our platform has an Atmel AT91RM9200 SOC on it, as well as ethernet and GPRS|EDGE|HSDPA comms.</p><p>Does anyone perhaps have some notes lying around as to how to prepare for a new platform?</p><p>I have so far created a target/linux/mytarget folder but I am missing a few subtle points. I manage a build to the point of building libpcap, where I get the following error message:&nbsp; cannot determine linux version when cross-compiling.</p><p>I am sure there are a few constants I am not configuring correctly, and anyone involved in new ports I am sure would be able to throw me a pointer or two!</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Hamish</p>									</div>
