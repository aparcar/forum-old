					<p>I flashed my WL500G2 to Backfire RC6, and configured it as a bridged client to serve as a printer server. All went well, but I am puzzled why &quot;Services&quot; tab is missing from LuCI; all I could see are &quot;Status&quot; &quot;System&quot; and &quot;Network&quot;. I installed the &quot;luci&quot; package, not &quot;luci-ssl&quot; if that matters. Appreciate if anyone can shed some light into it.</p><p>Happy New Year!</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>There are no more default pages in there, therfore it is hidden. It will reappear once you install addons that place themselves in the services menu.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the quick reply. You are totally correct! Once I install luci-app-p910nd, &quot;Services&quot; tab showed up with p910nd.</p>									</div>
