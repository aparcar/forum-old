					<p>I&#039;ve just begun using this integrated VDSL2 modem and router with 5x Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11n and 802.11ac wireless, 2x VoIP ports, 2x USB2 ports with optional USB2 cellular modem WAN backup integrated access device. The F1000 is a VMG8324 branded with custom firmware for the Irish ISP Eircom&#039;s eFibre (VDSL) service.</p><p>It is based on a Broadcom BCM63168 dual-core MIPS32 chip-set. There are two DSL model variations: the model suffix &quot;-B10A&quot; is for PSTN and &quot;-B30A&quot; is for ISDN. The VMG8324 is single-band WiFi 802.11n with 2x2 MIMO. The VMG8924 is dual-band with the addition of 802.11ac 3x3 MIMO.</p><p>The firmware uses Broadcom CFE, Linux 2.6.30, and many popular F/OSS applications.</p><p>I&#039;m exploring whether it is/will be possible to port OpenWRT to the device or whether there is a more appropriate project.</p><p>I obtained an F1000 and replaced the firmware with the stock Zyxel firmware. I&#039;ve detailed <a href="http://tjworld.net/wiki/Zyxel/VDSL_IAD">my initial findings about the device on my wiki</a>.</p><p>If working towards an OpenWrt firmware is possible I&#039;ll begin the process of putting the device details into wikidevi and figuring out the OpenWrt workflow. Tips and suggestions welcome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>iam_TJ</strong> on 18 Nov 2013, 19:04)</p>

					<p>Just got a VMG8324. Noticed it has 4 default users, besides admin, with passwords that get reset to the defaults each time it reboots.</p><p>Supervisor: don&#039;t know the password.<br />user: password user. Seems to have no access to CLI or Web.<br />zyuser: password 1234. Has access to a number of CLI command<br />support: password support. Has access to more CLI commands.</p><p>Also noted the NAT Masquerading rule is specific to the LAN interfaces subnet. If you have routers on your LAN, you can add routes to their subnets, but these subnets wont have internet access unless you manually change the IP tables through a shell.</p><p>i.e. <br />ssh to box and get a shell with<br />echo &amp;&amp; bash</p><p>#Check the existing rule state with<br />iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING --line-numbers </p><p>#Change the rule so internal subnets work with<br />iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING 2<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp2.1 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>This only needs to be done after a reboot. I have a ruby script polling to check and fix the NAT rules.</p><p>Also noted ifconfig shows 0 bytes sent and recieved on all interfaces, and the web interface seems to be reporting values that make no sense, showing lots of traffic, after the box had just been turned on and no one was using the internet. SNMP doesn&#039;t show interfaces at all, just a summary of the fields on the web page. </p><p>The uptime in SNMP was also silly, it said up for over a year and I had just turned it on, and this didn&#039;t match the &#039;uptime&#039; executed from the shell, which was sensible.</p><br /><p>Tried to get the source from your download site TJ, to fix some of these issues, but it said permission denied.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi <strong>zyo</strong>, and thanks for your information.</p><p>I configured other zyxel (P-2812HNU-F1) and works fine with my VoIP provider (Vodafone-Spain), but I can&#039;t get it work with VMG8924-B10A. Same codecs (711a) and SIP providers (ims.vodafone.es) with same port (5095) and outgoing proxy server (217.130.174.132), as well as remaining parameters like Registration Expire Timeout, Registration Retry Interval, ...</p><p>One (P-2812HNU-F1) works, but the other (VMG8924-B10A) does not work.</p><p>Which VoIp providers you tested?</p><p>I reported this issue to ZyXEL Support Uk and Spain, and I attached configuration files (P-2812HNU-F1.rom and VMG8924-B10A.conf, first based on Lantiq and second on Broadcom SoC) for both routers. But no answer received yet. Both with original firmware, purchased in shops not comming for any ISP.</p><p>Regarding memory usage, probably that is why router is so slow when accessing to it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>asmartin</strong> on 3 Feb 2014, 10:02)</p>

					<p>I tested with my ISP&#039;s VOIP service as well as a free one.<br />Knowing Vodafone it&#039;s entirely possible they might have locked down the service to only &quot;authorised&quot; devices (5095 is not the default SIP port so they might have already done this to stop people from BYOD)</p><p>Again this is just my speculation, you should try registering a free 3rd party VOIP service (e.g. pbxes.com) and see if that works before RMA the device etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>I dont think you can specify different DNS for different VLANs, haven&#039;t tried myself but that shouldn&#039;t have anything to do with Voip issues.</p><p>Again I would recommend trying out a free pbx/sip provider first and maybe contact Vodafone call center to clarify the settings.</p>									</div>
