					<p>I have been using DD-WRT with a WRT54GS for a while now and have liked it, but I wanted to try something different with my new WRT350N,&nbsp; I flashed it via the web interface on the stock Linksys firmware with snapshots/bcrm-2.4/openwrt-wrt350n_v1-squashfs.bin.&nbsp; Looking back I realize this wasn&#039;t a good idea.&nbsp; However, the firmware did go in fine, but the router started acting a little wonky, so I restarted it for the firmware to take effect.&nbsp; It booted up fine, except for the fact that the interfaces weren&#039;t setup up right, and I can&#039;t connect to it anymore.&nbsp; I spent the next two hours researching what I can do to get this thing back, but I had no luck with TFTP as there was no connection between my computer and the device.&nbsp; I tried different kinds of combinations, but when I plugged the WAN port back in, I noticed on bootup that the router was accessible for ~4 seconds.&nbsp; Using this little opening, I tried to TFTP the stock Linksys firmware back in, but it fails.&nbsp; All the data is transfered, but it fails with error code 13.&nbsp; I tried using DD-WRT mini for a 350N, and that is fully transfered, but the reflash never takes place.&nbsp; The router just idles.&nbsp; After a TFTP I can ping the router for several minutes, but after that connection just fades.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t opened it up yet, but I am willing to do that.&nbsp; I am also willing to buy a JTAG cable, or solder in a serial cable if needed.&nbsp; Any help would be great, and thanks for reading.</p>									</div>

					<p>With a little more research, I was able to do a successful TFTP transfer.&nbsp; Directions for what worked for me:<br /><a href="https://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=25637">https://dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=25637</a></p>									</div>
