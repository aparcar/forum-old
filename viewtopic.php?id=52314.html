					<p>The off. package for squid is based on version 2.7. Using it on openWRT, I traced down DNS-problems with certain web sites, which should be fixed in newer squid (3.4).<br />These DNS-problems (bugs) should explain some notes on the web, considering openWRT/squid to be &quot;slow&quot;, which is the result of very slow DNS for certain sites (mostly ad server).<br />Has anybody a newer squid package ?<br />As I am rather good in squid itself, but more or less a newbie to openWRT/crosscompiling, I am hesitating to do it myself, as it seems, that a few patches are necessary for squid to compile successfully.</p>									</div>
