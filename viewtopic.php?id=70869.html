					<p>I have four AP&#039;s which are connected via LAN-Cable. In one of the room (which don&#039;t have a LAN-connection), I need a LAN-connection. My idea was to configure an additional AP as a WiFi-client or as a member of a mesh network.<br />I&#039;ve found examples how to configure B.A.T.M.A.N. if only one AP is connected via cable. How do I configure the servers (Cable connected) and client (connected via WiFi)?<br />I also have plans in creating an open guest network, separated with VLAN and of course bandwidth limited. Is this possible with B.A.T.M.A.N. without additional settings?</p>									</div>

					<p>For a single point to point link I would just use AP(WDS).&nbsp; If you set one of the APs to WDS mode it can support both regular users and WDS links.&nbsp; Then set up a STA(WDS) on a router that is not wired, to connect to that AP and bridge it into the LAN network.&nbsp; Use the BSSID option on the STA if all your APs have the same SSID to force it to connect to one particular one.&nbsp; This STA router can also offer a local AP, or you can use it only as a STA if you just need wired clients in that room.</p><p>For guest networks, lately I have been using gretap to tunnel the guests through the LAN back to the main router instead of using VLANs.&nbsp; It works over AP-STA links, which do not support VLANnning.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 9 May 2017, 03:24)</p>
