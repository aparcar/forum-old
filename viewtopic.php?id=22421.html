					<p>In cases where OpenWRT is run on x86 boards like Alix, there is more than enough CPU and RAM to run more hefty applications. The PostgreSQL package is already set up in the buildroot to optionally allow for both client and server components.&nbsp; Would you find it useful to do the same for MySQL?&nbsp; I certainly would, but I&#039;m a bit of a buildroot noobie.&nbsp; Is there someone out there who could rewrite the MySQL makefile to add server compilation as a feature?</p>									</div>
