					<p>I am confused about what the maximum image size is that you can still succesfully flash given a FLASH memory size. Is this the physical flash chip&#039;s capacity minus the size of the bootloader? How can you determine it?</p><p>On a related note (I guess) I get messages like</p><p>mini_fo: using base directory: /<br />mini_fo: using storage directory: /jffs<br />mini_fo: build_sto_structure: failed to create storage dir [1].<br />mini_fo: get_neg_sto_dentry: ERROR building sto structure.<br />mini_fo: create_sto_file: ERROR getting neg. sto dentry.</p><p>on boot of my build; does this mean my image was too big (it still sort of works though)</p><p>Finally, I wonder if there are build options that I need to set to shrink modules or strip them of symbols or something since my wl.o is no less than 850474 bytes, looks excessive to me? </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, </p><p>Could someone answer the questions stated in the original post please? I&#039;m getting the same error and very much interested in any information that will allow to fix the problem. I&#039;m using Kamikaze r7925 and all attempts to build workable configuration end up with this error despite the image size (.trx file) is &lt;1.6M while the flash chip fits 2M (ASUS WL-700gE)</p><p>Thanks!<br />Andrey</p>									</div>
