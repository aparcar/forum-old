					<p>Well, I am also curious. I will probably upgrade my WDR4900 to CC some day, and I will update the documentation accordingly... when I have facts.</p><p>Although there were some problems with WDR4900 during development of CC, I think it is supposed to work just fine now.</p>									</div>

					<p>I run trunk builds on my WDR4900, and update roughly every 2-4 weeks. Haven&#039;t had issues for a long time, I don&#039;t see why the CC release wouldn&#039;t work.</p><p>Edit: I&#039;ve learned that while there aren&#039;t many WDR4900 users in the community, the users speak quite loudly. If there is an issue with it, there will be a reported bug very quickly.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 19:56)</p>
