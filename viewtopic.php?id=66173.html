					<p>I have been having some wifi issue with an access point running Openwrt snapshot build. Every few days the wifi stop accepting clients. Everything seems to run ok and nothing of importance in system log except wifi button shows 0% and does not work. I can disable and enable wifi and it would work for few days again.<br />I tried different openwrt build as well as gargoyle builds but same thing result.</p><p>So, I am thinking of restarting wifi every night until i get a better access point.<br />Can anyone help me with a script I can enter in to scheduled task box?<br />All I need is to disable and enable the wifi.</p>									</div>

					<p>hmm... that&#039;s a possibility and the only way to validate your hypothesis is to test it with the router&#039;s original antenna and observe.&nbsp; it&#039;s also quite possible you may have a defective replacement antenna.&nbsp; I would still check your power supply to ensure it is delivering enough amps so you can rule out power supply.</p>									</div>
