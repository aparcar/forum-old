					<p>Thanks for your reply maurer. Manoj has provided a great resource (a trx bin for the N300 HD). I&#039;ve also commented on his blog page. My question was about the next release of Openwrt (10.03.2?) and if the two routers would be supported in that build. If so, hopefully someone would be kind enough to build trx files as well :-)&nbsp; The N600 HD in particular is a dual band and I was wondering if the 5GHz would be supported.</p>									</div>

					<p>i find it less likely to be supported in the next stable release<br />it&#039;s not even in the trunk yet...<br />but maybe a developer could add it...</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately, it was quite an effort to get it to work, at least for a semi-experienced techie.&nbsp; I gave up and used an old version of Tomato and it works quite well for my purposes.&nbsp; Hopefully this router will be supported in the next release of OpenWrt.&nbsp; Ideally, we&#039;ll have a binary that just works.</p><p>A big issue is that the next release of OpenWrt is not on the horizon.&nbsp; No one seems to be sure of when it will even come out and asking about it is a No-no on this forum.&nbsp; This is not meant to be a dig at the developers but just an overall comment on the sad state of releases (once a year or even less often).&nbsp; That is why I ended up using Tomato.&nbsp; By the time we have a release, it will be time to buy another router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wasn&#039;t aware that Tomato supported the Belkin N600.&nbsp; I prefer to use OpenWRT when I can because it has the best semblance of a development process and I believe the most potential/lowest bus factor compared to the &quot;dude in garage&quot; firmwares.&nbsp; But I could consider falling back to Tomato if OpenWRT isn&#039;t going to run well on a device and Tomato is... just don&#039;t like it.</p><p>Edit: Love tomato&#039;s UI, don&#039;t like the dude in garage development &quot;process.&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>normblop</strong> on 12 May 2014, 21:48)</p>

					<p>Agreed. I&#039;d much rather use Openwrt. Perhaps we&#039;ll get a new release soon (with N300 and N600 support) because of Heart bleed.</p>									</div>
