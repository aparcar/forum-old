					<p>It has been a very nice experience to learn OpenWrt, sadly now has come the time to wrap my DGN3500 back in its box.<br />Every single cool feature that drew me into this journey has failed.<br />I was dreaming of a backup of all my stuff in a hard drive which I could access remotely from anywhere<br />That didn&#039;t work out:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=60057">Cannot attach usb hard drives</a><br />and I don&#039;t seem to be the only one reporting this issue with this machine.</p><p>I wanted to use a webcam to keep an eye on my house when out and about<br />I wanted to listen to my music with loudspeakers connected to my router, using my phone as a remote control<br />All of this didn&#039;t work out either:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=72896">USB Video &amp; Audio fail: isochronous transfer not supported!!!</a></p><p>Is it my router faulty or should I just upgrade to a better one?</p>									</div>

					<p>Since my last post I have moved over to LEDE on my DGN3500.&nbsp; It was absolutely stunning.&nbsp; The only reason it ever went down was power utility power outs long enough to drop the UPS.&nbsp; Ran until 2017 November, at which time I moved house and got fiber - but my trusty LEDE DGN3500 came out when I could not get the Tenda router that was here when I moved in up and going, and it got me up and running on fiber!</p><p>Later I got VOX to give me the promised wireless router - turned out to be a Mikrotik, that looks quite powerful.&nbsp; But they did not immediately hand over admin privileges on the Mikrotik, so back out came the DGN3500!&nbsp; And I&#039;m working on it right now!</p><p>The reason for me posting here, and not on the LEDE forum...&nbsp; I see LEDE is merged with OpenWRT now.&nbsp; So, has anyone moved to an OpenWRT system past CC 15.05 yet on the DGN3500?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cfbosch</strong> on 21 Mar 2018, 10:30)</p>

					<p>Yes, I am now using OpenWrt SNAPSHOT. It&#039;s basically the same LEDE codebase with updates.<br />I am happy that the projects merged again.</p>									</div>
