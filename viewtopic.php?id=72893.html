					<p>Hi All,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A heads up/request for assistance, it appears that it is not possible to downgrade current production Ubiquiti NanoBeams (at least not the M2) to 5.5 in order to successfully install OpenWRT.</p><p>Based on some analysis of the fwupdate binary (ubntbox actually I think) it seems that the issue is that the firmware updater checks against a bunch of OUIs and the OUI of this one isn&#039;t supported for installing 5.5. firmwares.</p><p>Raised a ticket with UBNT and they provided some suggestions, eventually got to Tier 2 who checked with engineering and they confirmed the NanoBeam I have is &quot;too new&quot; to install AirOS 5.5.</p><p>A further complication in all of this is the fact that my NanoBeam doesn&#039;t seem to want to enter TFTP recovery, the LEDs do all the right things (verified process and result against a PowerBeam), but nothing responds on 192.168.1.20.</p><p>At this point I&#039;m looking at a brute force approach in patching the firmware updater binary to change the check for an OUI I know works (a fairly recent PowerBeam M2) and patch over that with the OUI of this NanoBeam, not sure if that&#039;ll be enough or not (the firmware update logic is rather convoluted and my MIPS assembly is pretty rusty).</p><p>Unfortunately if it goes sideways, due to the TFTP recovery issue, I will be stuck with only one option, namely to crack open the NanoBeam (compromising it&#039;s weatherproofing) to connect to the onboard UART <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>If anybody can provide alternative suggestions that would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-J</p>									</div>

					<p>A follow up on this one, it seems that TFTP recovery only works from 6.0.6-beta onwards on these particular devices, very strange... And does potentially rather complicate matters vis the &quot;brute force&quot; method I mentioned above.</p>									</div>

					<p>So I caved and cracked it open, unfortunately the header is directly under part of the mounting feature so you can&#039;t just drill through the case to gain access <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>You can load older firmware using urescue in TFTP but for some reason it&#039;s not overwriting the u-boot partition, I might have to do that manually...</p>									</div>

					<p>And now that I have access to the UART I decided &quot;why not, might as well just throw the openwrt image at it and see what happened&quot;... Lo and behold, from the 6.0.6-beta AirOS firmware I loaded a current 15.05.1 openwrt image and it works...</p><p>So it appears that whatever changed in AirOS 5.6 to break OpenWRT has now been &quot;fixed&quot; in 6.0.6-beta...</p>									</div>

					<p>So you could simply flash from the stock OS web interface after all?</p><p>I&#039;d like to buy a couple more Nanobeam M5 to use with OpenWrt but not sure if they will flash.&nbsp; They look impossible to open the case without damaging something.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, but with caveats...</p><p>If you can downgrade to AirOS 5.5 do it that way. The last M5 I installed openwrt on happily downgraded to 5.5.10, seems to be particular OUIs that do or don&#039;t work.</p><p>I&#039;ve found there has been some breakage with flashing from 6.0.6-beta on my M2;<br />- There was an issue where the ethernet interface wasn&#039;t turning up on 192.168.1.1 in spite of br-lan being configured with that address, but I didn&#039;t think to try wifi.<br />- I attempted to roll back to AirOS so I could validate the process again and the rollback failed, I&#039;m going to restore from a known good flash image and try again, once I&#039;ve validated it I&#039;ll add the details to the NanoBeam page in the Wiki.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jrandombob</strong> on 15 Jan 2018, 23:24)</p>
