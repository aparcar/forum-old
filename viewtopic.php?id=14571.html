					<p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; We are building openwrt rev. 10180 (has support for pc engines elix boards) on to pc engines elix3c2 board which has AMD geodesc processor. I am getting the following error.<br /> &quot;GRUB configure error: GRUB requires a working absolute objcopy&quot;. I also looked into latest source on openwrt development branch there are no additional changes to grub since rev. 10180.</p><p> I searched GRUB website and the net. Here is what I gather.</p><p>1. Apparently this is GRUB configure issue on AMD64 bit platforms. It is being fixed on GRUB2 development branch. What happens to GRUB legacy. I don&#039;t see any patch being developed.</p><p>2. GRUB Legacy doesn&#039;t support 64 bit. Even though AMD Geodesc is 64 bit, GRUB legacy compile will default to 32 bit.&nbsp; This shouldn&#039;t be a problem.</p><p> Lot of people encountering this problem during last four years.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure after reading all the posts what is the fix. I see 2 solutions are suggested. One is to disable the GRUB configure check for the failure condition. Is that right way without side affects. In Grub bug list, a patch is listed but that doesn&#039;t seem to work for me.</p><p> I liked to know how other people are dealing with this if they are encoutering&nbsp; problem. I also like to hear pcengines elix3c2 board for possible fix.</p><p> I searched openwrt website but without success.</p><p> I am new to the forum. Hence sorry beforehand if I unknowingly didn&#039;t follow any etiqutte.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>--Sreeni</p>									</div>

					<p>I think in my case too; on a 32 bit install it works fine on fedora 10, however its not the case with fedora 11 and fedora 12.<br /> I know there&#039;s something wrong some where, and i have gotta fix it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can once again confirm this: <br />a.&gt;I just copied the source tree from a fedora 12 box, using sftp, to another box which has fedora 10<br />b&gt; performed make clean<br />c&gt; Explicitly emptied build_dir and staging_dir<br />d&gt; svn @revision 19221.<br />e&gt; did a fresh make without changing a line or word anywhere.<br />It just works like a charm....</p><p>So possibly there have been some changes in the host tool chain which builds the target toolchain...&lt;-- possibly a wild guess.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mohnkhan</strong> on 18 Jan 2010, 14:39)</p>
