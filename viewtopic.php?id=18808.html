					<p>I&#039;m unsuccessful building a working image, probably a silly mistake since I&#039;m an OpenWRT newbie - but I&#039;ve been at it for some time now incl checking the forum, and getting a bit desperate</p><p>The build runs through without error, even with V=99 I cannot find anything extraordinary</p><p>However, the flashed CF card never contains a correct kernel partition - ie I cannot mount it on the build system, and fsck spits out a barrage of errors (incorrect superblock etc). The root partitions are sometimes mountable, sometimes not</p><p>I mounted the .fs &amp; .kernel image files in bin through the loop device on the build system, and they appear fine</p><p>So it seems something is broken in the final assembly of the image - but again I cannot find anything strange in the make V=99 output</p><p>Is it maybe a problem to use OpenSUSE for building? Some people report Alix build issues with certain Fedora versions - if OpenSUSE is a problem, anyone able to tell me which build system they used successfully for the Alix target profile?</p><p>Or the gcc version? I used 4.1.2 as in the AlixPort description, but somewhere is a ticket resolution saying 4.3.2+ should be used - is this a possible cause here as well?</p><p>Any help/pointers most appreciated!</p><p>Build system: OpenSuse 11.1<br />Target system: Alix 3C1<br />OpenWRT version: tried trunk, 8.09 rc1, 8.09 rc2 - none will work. Among others, I&#039;ve followed the OpenWRT AlixPort Wiki to the letter (on the trunk) without success</p>									</div>
