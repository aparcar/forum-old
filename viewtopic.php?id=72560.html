					<p>I have problems connecing to a wireless WPA2-EAP network and wonder if I make some configuration error.<br />I recently bought an Archer C5 v1.2 (Atheros chipset) and have already uploaded newest LEDE. I read that in order to use WPA Enterprise I needed to use wpad (i.e.done opkg update | opkg remove wpad-mini | opkg install wpad). </p><p>Now when I try to use and configure using Luci I fail to connect to the network.</p><p>What I do:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Scan for wireless networks (Button scan on the wireless page)</p></li><li><p>Click &#039;Join&#039; to join the intended network (Shown as WPA2 802.1x, i.e. WPA2 Enterprise.)</p></li><li><p>Select &quot;WAN&quot; for the zone</p></li><li><p>Try to enter the following values under for the security setting<br /></p><ul><li><p>Encryption: WPA2-EAP</p></li><li><p>Cipher: auto</p></li><li><p>EAP-Method: PEAP</p></li><li><p>Path to CA-Certificate: (leave blank)</p></li><li><p>Authentication: MSCHAPv2</p></li><li><p>Identity: &lt;my username&gt;</p></li><li><p>Anonymous Identity: &lt;my username&gt;</p></li><li><p>Password: &lt;my password&gt;</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Should it be possible to connect to a WPA2-EAP network like this?</strong></p><p><em>If my parameters above are wrong, how do I figure out what to configure correctly?</em></p><p><em>Or are some steps required which are not to be done in Luci?</em></p><p>I have no access to the AP, and don&#039;t have much details about its configuration. The AP is from Cisco, and I can login with PC and Android just fine. In PC adapter settings the properties are shown as &quot;WPA2-Enterprise&quot;, &quot;AES&quot; and &quot;PEAP&quot;.</p><br /><p>Background:</p><p>Although not really used to Linux, using SCP, command line etc. shouldn&#039;t be a big problem if required.</p><p>Right now I already fail at connecting that WPA2-EAP network. In the end I would like to optimize the Wifi connection range in one of the dorm rooms and I would like to extend the WLAN range. However there is the problem that provided network is with WPA enterprise (I.e. not using PSK, but user(!)/password combination), so simple range extending is not possible. It managed to use the router already to be a client in one wireless network and&nbsp; provide a new private to test this scenario, but in this testcase the original network was not yet the one with WPA2 enterprise. So I guess that once I can connect to the WPA2 enterprise network as client, the rest should simply work then.</p>									</div>

					<p>First, check the wan network physical settings make sure that &quot;bridge&quot; is not checked and the wifi client is the only thing attached to wan.&nbsp; A wifi client interface cannot be in a bridge, it will not come up at all.</p><p>Then check your system log.&nbsp; This should tell why it is not connecting.&nbsp; Yes, connecting to 802.1X is the same as PSK once connected.</p><p>I prefer to configure manually rather than use the &quot;join&quot; button on the scan results page.&nbsp; It can do a few strange things.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 16 Nov 2017, 00:55)</p>

					<p>Thanks mk24!</p><p>In the end I got it working. But it cost quite some time, most of it for understanding what config lines are required and which values to test.. Documentation wasn&#039;t good for my case (lists of too many possible options and values, many not required or harmful), and basically each example I found on the net was different. So it took quite some time to understand at least half-way what to really put in the wireless config file.</p><p>Also strange, even with the working setup, Luci still shows that no encryption is used (although WPA2 in place), of course confusing me and taking additional time.</p><p>In the end the config is straight forward now, just putting it here, perhaps interesting for anyone else. <br />I think this is the simple configuration for beeing a client on a WPA EAP network with user <em>and </em>password combination (only showing the network interface part of wireless config part)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-iface &#039;radio_wpa_client&#039;
