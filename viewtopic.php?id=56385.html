					<p>Hello,</p><p>I use openwrt (right now I&#039;m on Chaos Calmer,&nbsp; r44879) and my isp is nice enough to give me a whole IPv6 range (a /64) but it doesn&#039;t do prefix delegation.</p><p>My issue is my router (a wndr3700) does get an IPv6 and it can reach the internet but devices on the LAN, even though they get IPv6 addresses, have no valid default route.</p><p>My goal is to have a working automatic setup while using the native IPv6 stack (meaning no radvd, no bridge/broute crap, ...).<br />My understanding is I cannot use ip6assign because I don&#039;t have prefix delegation.</p><p>It took me a while to find all the bits and pieces explaining the whole server/hybrid/relay and the magic &quot;master&quot; option but now they make sense. I ended up enabling relaying because of the &quot;no prefix delegation&quot; thing.</p><p>My only remaining issue is routing: how come odhcpd doesn&#039;t relay routing information? What am I missing here? Should I just give up on the automagic part and add an ip6prefix to my wan6 interface?</p><p>I don&#039;t know if what my ISP does is common but to say the least, it makes setting up IPv6 a pain in the butt.</p><p>If anyone has any idea, feel free to participate to this thread for I&#039;ve tried so many different setup, I feel now more confused than before.</p><p>Right now my setup looks like the following.</p><p>/etc/config/dhcp</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;

					<p>If you can&#039;t get relaying to work, you can fall back to NAT6. Of course, that means you have to live with the downsides of NAT, too, but it works very well.

					<p>Sorry, I was wrong. ISP does not use DHCPv6. I tcpdump-ed icmp6 and found that they&#039;re sending RAs with /64 prefix on external (wan) interface. Router accepts them with wan6 pseudo-interface and gets the address on physical iface eth1.<br />ISP does not provide any routed subnet and officially does not support IPV6.<br />I guess I must either use NAT6 or do some very black and dirty magic on packet level.<br />Or just use he.net and save my brain from decease <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> What exactly I did<br />Because having IPV6 without incoming connectivity is nonsense.</p><p>I can be wrong, may be it is possible to do this with relayd pseudobridge and odhcpc ndp proxy ?
