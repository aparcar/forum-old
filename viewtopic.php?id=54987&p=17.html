					<p>There&#039;s a rumor that the Xiaomi Mini Padovan image, being MT7620A based, will work in a ZBT WE826T with a Sierra MC7455 cellular card.&nbsp; Can someone &quot;in the know&quot; give me more details on this - does it indeed work, without patches?</p><p>Also, I&#039;m noticing that the MT7620A wifi seems to be unstable (with OpenWrt, which is what ZBT devices come with). Specifically, the wifi will run stable for several hours (or sometimes days), and then begin to issue &quot;deauths&quot; every 6 to 12 minutes, repeatedly. This, of course, causes connected devices to drop, rescan, and reconnect. If a device happens to be in the middle of a file transfer (or streaming) when the deauth is issued, that becomes problematic.</p><p>Does anyone know if this problem happens to be a &quot;bug&quot; or issue with the MT7620A SoC microcode, or a problem with the driver being utilized (OpenWrt by default)? The problem is exhibited on two (2) MoFi routers, and two (2) ZBT WE826 routers, so it is not just an isolated incident.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s a driver, and not microcode, problem.</p><p>I would love to flash something totally outside the realm of OpenWrt, to see if it solves the above problem (but that &quot;something&quot; needs to support cellular WAN – specifically, the Sierra MC7455). I was wondering if this (Xiaomi Mini Padovan image) might be the solution to my problem.&nbsp; Any advice, tips, or hints would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;ve bought one of these recently and as most of you would expect I have issues with WiFi on OpenWRT. Now I know I can use PandoraBox (actually have it installed right now), but it&#039;s old and I&#039;d actually want to help fix OpenWRT for Mi Mini. What&#039;s surprising is that from just issues on 15.05 release OpenWRT went to no wifi at all on the current trunk (2016-10-27). I&#039;m happy to be the hands for anyone who potentially has an idea on what to check and how to fix. Currently I have this in log every time I try to enable wifi (5G radio):</p><p>Sun Oct 30 00:52:13 2016 daemon.notice netifd: radio0 (4746): Interface 0 setup failed: INVALID_WPA_PSK<br />Sun Oct 30 00:52:13 2016 daemon.notice netifd: radio0 (4746): WARNING: Variable &#039;interfaces&#039; does not exist or is not an array/object</p><p>I&#039;ve found a similar issue reported 3 months ago with no updates - ticket 23115 (cannot post links yet, sorry)</p><p>Let&#039;s try to fix this together, folks, I&#039;m good with general Linux but not so with hardware drivers and openwrt specific services, need a hand here.</p><p>UPD: figured this one out - INVALID_WPA_PSK is when &quot;key&quot; in wireless config is less than 8 symbols. Current trunk version of luci shows and sets too much stuff in wireless security tab so I got lost and put my wifi password into &quot;password&quot; field, should&#039;ve used &quot;key&quot; instead.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>f3flight</strong> on 30 Oct 2016, 06:13)</p>
