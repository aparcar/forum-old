The possibility of doing so is what lead to this brain dead FCC regulation which Linksys needs to comply with. The best you can ask for is to allow reducing the power levels, eg. make them the maximum of user supplied and firmware supplied values. I&#039;d loose channel 12 and 13 for good but could at least use channels 1 - 11. Currently 2.4 GHz can&#039;t be legally operated at all.</p><p>The tinfoil hat crowd surely would appreciate such a feature as well. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>What puzzles me here is that when reading out the flash the device it&#039;s labelled an EU version and yet the the wifi module is locked to US. Are all new v2 and Rango like this?</p>									</div>
