					<p><strong>Use Case Summary </strong></p><p>Micro technology (SOC, etc) has allowed us to shrink the router footprint substantially, but few of the manufacturers have begun to address the use case paradigm. </p><p><strong>Home routers are expected to always have power and a wired connection to the ISP.&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>A portable router will require its own power and be expected to connect to what ever AP is available under a variety of wireless and wired configurations.&nbsp; </strong></p><p>To be truly portable, these devices all require the following minimum set of features:<br />1 – Battery power for the device and its real time clock.<br />2 – Dual radios so the WWAN and WLAN can be configured independently.<br />3 – Connection management tool set.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A - Easy to access connection management tools.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B - Function on the smallest of mobile devices (i.e. cell phone)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C - Support the retention and maintenance of a connection list.</p><p>The goal of this post is to highlight the use factors in hopes that manufacturers and developers will consider these as important criteria in new designs.&nbsp; <strong>Using my portable router should be as easy as using my cell phone.</strong>&nbsp; I should be able to press a button to turn it on, and if configured, connect automatically to my saved connections, or be prompted to connect.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>For those interested in the details, read on....</strong></p><p>We have been using the terms &quot;portable device&quot; and &quot;mobile device&quot; for years now.&nbsp; Travel router is relatively new.&nbsp; <strong>Would you buy a laptop, tablet or phone that only ran off an external battery?&nbsp; I think not.</strong>&nbsp; The expectation of devices in these classes SHOULD be they run on their own internal power, otherwise I will suggest these are just <span class="bbu">&quot;micro-routers&quot;</span>.&nbsp; Some devices, do have batteries, however it does not appear that any of the powered device can maintain the real time clock.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with micro-routers, and there are a lot of good applications for these devices.&nbsp; I am suggesting they are not &quot;portable&quot; to the standards that we are now accustom to, and fail to meet the suggested use case.</p><p>In addition to the power issue, there is a radio issue.&nbsp; <strong>The single radio supports a single channel and configuration for both WAN and LAN</strong>. While one may be able to work around this in the home environment for a static configuration, it does not support the dynamic client side configuration requirement that users are faced with connecting to hotspots, unless they also reconfigure the LAN side client and AP.&nbsp; There is no device, in any class that I am aware of, that offers 2 radios in the same frequency band. Bridging on home units is substantially the same use case as what these travel routers need to be able to do well all the time.&nbsp; It&#039;s well documented that this function is not without problems and constraints. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#bridgedclientmodeissues">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clien … modeissues</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="bbu">Unfortunately the current OpenWRT design will frequently result in an inaccessible wireless network if the WAN side connection is not found.</span></p><p>Some vendors, like HooToo and TP-Link and offer internal batteries and software features, including mobile apps, in their products with stock firmware.&nbsp; Unfortunately the software features disappear after installing OpenWRT.&nbsp; Gl.inet has no battery powered offerings, but their routers include OpenWRT BB 14.07 and an additional proprietary user friendly GUI included with the device, though this is not clear from the website. <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/ar150/">http://www.gl-inet.com/ar150/</a></p><p>No one that I am aware of is doing both.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>There are no OpenWRT mobile APPs.</strong>(IOS/Android)&nbsp; There is no mobile device compatible Web GUI for OpenWRT.&nbsp; There are no connection manager specific tools.&nbsp; There is no capability to store previously used connections.&nbsp; The lack of these features makes the devices inconvenient to use in the real world, and can be addressed by the community.</p><p><strong>The &quot;Road Warrior&quot; market is substantially unaddressed.</strong>&nbsp; This group of generally technologically savvy users fill the cafes, airports, and hotels daily and lack the ability to connect securely with any of the off the shelf current products.&nbsp; <strong>None include VPN tools.</strong>&nbsp; The current functionality is basically a small workgroup.</p><p>If one looks at the current crop of product broadly, with stock firmware, one will find that these products APPs are targeted at multimedia and file sharing.&nbsp; They support USB data devices, some support cameras, most have some level of DLNA and can stream media.</p><p>OpenWRT can meet the need of the &quot;Road Warrior&quot;, technically, with VPN, Samba, USB support, miniDLNA and other packages.&nbsp; The usability, unfortunately, is not so good on a small device, and indeed most of this relates to the connection management tool set.&nbsp; The OpenWRT GUI, as noted here and in some other of my posts, is not mobile compatible.&nbsp; It is a few too many clicks away from being considered &quot;easy to use&quot; and does not allow one to maintain a list of previous connections.&nbsp; <strong>For Hot Spot use the process must be quick and ideally transparent.</strong>&nbsp; The user will be there a short time and spending any significant time connecting reduces the time “using”.</p><p>There are numerous other router features that could be discussed.&nbsp; The number of USB ports, GPIOs, battery size, CPU speed, etc are differentiating product features that will be of different levels of interest to different consumers.&nbsp; The importance of these is secondary today to meeting, what I will suggest are common core features of the product class (battery, dual radios and connection tools).</p><p>I am not affiliated in any with any product offered for sale by any manufacturer or site, nor have I received any incentive from any to promote the same.&nbsp; I own a HooToo TM02, and have been working to establish an <strong>easy to use</strong> OpenVPN connection to access files from my home server for about a year.&nbsp; It&#039;s been extremely frustrating in today&#039;s world that I am unable to do this.</p><p>The community can not fix the hardware issues, however we can lobby the vendors to do so.&nbsp; We do have some ability to address the soft features in the product.&nbsp; Hopefully some of the developers will come to our aid, but if not maybe there are some creative souls that can improve the tool set.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi nice post.</p><p>So a proper or good portable router should have:<br />1. Battery<br />2. real time clock<br />3. Dual radios<br />4. Openwrt<br />5. Android/ios app<br />6. mobile web UI<br />7. VPN, especially OpenVPN<br />8. Able to connect to hotspot<br />9. USB, Samba, miniDLNA<br />10. Easy to use and a lot of other features</p><p>Incorporating too many features in a product could make it redundant in functions and expensive. Most users seems just want to use one or several features and just want a cheap device. Adding battery and dual radios almost double the cost and size. When you have a 5000mAh battery with wifi, values at $50 for example. One day, when you have good 4G and don&#039;t need this wifi, you will miss a $20 5000mAh battery. </p><p>Actually I don&#039;t know. What is the core value of a portable router? As you can always use your mobile for all those functions listed above.</p>									</div>

					<p>@alzhao, Thank you for your reply.</p><p>The core value of a portable router is to allow multiple devices to connect to a single device that can then connect to a single AP.&nbsp; <br />*In many hotels a user is provided with only a single connection, and a need to connect more than one device.<br />* In many hot spots one does not have easy access to a power connection, and carrying a separate battery is just not convenient.&nbsp; <br />* I want to run all devices through VPN and may wish to allow a device with no VPN to attach.</p><p>Regarding redundant features, personally I would forgo the mobile WEB UI for a iphone/android APP.&nbsp; We are in an omni-channel world and the user should have a choice as to how to connect.</p><p>As for the radio, I think this may not be as big an issue as I thought just yesterday.&nbsp; My usage has been in OpenWRT software, and I am learning that the process vendors are using in their firmware solutions may address some of the problems OpenWRT has with connection management.&nbsp; See posts 295 and 298 here.&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=292276#p292276">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 76#p292276</a></p><p>The hardware features I am suggesting are items 1-3.&nbsp; While I am writing on the OpenWRT forum, and looking to use this software (4), I am not opposed to a vendor adding VPN to their existing firmware as a solution.&nbsp; Indeed, some vendors are close to a solution and only need to add VPN.&nbsp; I am not clear if most devices with factory firmware have a working RTC or not, but see 1 &amp; 2 as the same (1 &amp; 1a).</p><p>The ease of use features (5.6) are available in most firmware and LOST with OpenWRT.&nbsp; They should be supplied by the community, not the hardware vendor, though the vendor may be motivated to offer a complete unified solution and the first will probably gain my business.&nbsp; I would prefer an app that I can use across all vendors, but either works (Google Play or Apple Store have no OpenWRT apps, but there is a DD-WRT APP).&nbsp; Item 9 again is offered by most vendors today, and available in OpenWRT.</p><p>I have no problem with a $50 device.&nbsp; Again, I differentiate micro router from portable router, and battery is the single biggest factor.&nbsp; I am not suggesting this as a hobbyists device.&nbsp; The price of most of the battery units are closer to this number.&nbsp; Small does not mean cheap in my book.&nbsp; I am, as I think many road warriors are, willing to pay for features and convenience.&nbsp; As for the size (and weight) I expect it to be about the size of a cell phone and up to twice as think.&nbsp; A unit with NO wires does not even need to come out of my bag or pocket.&nbsp; All I need to do is press the button and work.</p><p>In summary, to use this at a mobile hot spot, for hardware I need a battery and for software VPN and easy to use connection tools.&nbsp; I am now of the opinion the radios can be made workable.</p>									</div>

					<p>@RangerZ:&nbsp; Wonderfull post!</p><p>@alzhao: How about making it slightly modulair?</p><p>I would like to have some &#039;hackerspace&#039; inside. <br />RTC is not always a must.

They might use the header for something else... </p><p>For the battery maybe there is an option to use a popular cellphone battery. Samsung?<br />Then sell the routers without battery. Some may not even need a battery and they would then have a nice square space to place a custom PCB.</p><p>I think the Domino system might make a very nice customisable travel router just by adding an enclosure / battery holder, a second radio and a battery management.&nbsp; </p><p>This is what I have been missing in the laptop era...&nbsp; I always hated laptop&#039;s because I never could make my own configuration.

					<p>My plan is to make a case to hold a micro router like a GL.iNet 6408A and a battery.&nbsp; That limits the clandestine nature of an injected molded case and brings attention to it, but in my pack of gizmos, gadgets, and 3D printed stuff it would camouflage itself.</p><p>A modular architecture would be best to get the maker and hacker communities on board.&nbsp; I think we&#039;re about to hit a Renaissance of these types of devices.&nbsp; You can tell people are interested by the popularity of the tor-enabled micro routers like the Anonabox, Invisibox, and others.&nbsp; I just read somewhere that Invisibox was making one with a battery.</p><p>There&#039;s a few venerable articles talking about Onion Pi (transparent tor proxy on a Raspberry Pi) from a few years ago.&nbsp; We definitely have the hardware, especially with the latest crop of SBCs, but the software has to get out of the command line for this kind of thing to take off.&nbsp; I&#039;m comfortable at the command line and basic programming and I&#039;m getting sucked in to troubleshooting known issues that have no fixes and are stupid-level problems (ie OpenWRT wifi crashes under certain specific conditions AND DOESN&#039;T RESTART ).</p><p>I&#039;m not saying the products need to be ready-for-Grandma just yet, but maybe stop requiring uber-l33t hax0rs just to run the software and make it so &quot;script kiddies&quot; who follow instructions well can run the stuff.</p>									</div>

On the one hand they do work to put those boxes on the market, but the price seems way too high. they charge more for flashing OpenWRT on those boxes then the actual price of the hardware...&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand yes, people want plug and play, but everyone here on this list can flash a well configured OpenWRT image on a router and sell plug and play boxes to friends...&nbsp; <br />That would also spread some knowlegde.</p><p>And, befor i forget to mention: still a modulair concept can be sold as fully working travelrouterchargerpowerpack for that part of the market and still offer a hack-friendly platform.</p>									</div>

					<p>@ RangerZ<br />I admire the clear view you have on the tools you need. And I also see the advantage of having a fullblown travel router that actually lives up to its promise.</p><p>Back to your original write up:<br />How much battery power would you need? <br />How many hours of action should be possible?&nbsp; A second radio would need extra power.<br />Is a RTC really essential? (as soon as the router has web access it should be able to reach an NTP server)</p><p>Question to the devs:<br />What would be the preferred way to connect external hardware? SPI, I2C, other. What is most compatible across all SoC&#039;s?</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#bridgedclientmodeissues">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clien … modeissues</a> seems to need a couple of updates. <br />Does a repeater still need 2 radios? <br />D-link DIR-505 seems to use WPS to do the repeater configuration might this be the way to do it on OpenWRT as well? <a href="http://www.dlink.com/uk/en/support/faq/routers/mobile-routers/dir-series/dir-505/uk_dir-505_how-to-use-wps-to-connect-to-my-router-in-repeater-mode">http://www.dlink.com/uk/en/support/faq/ … eater-mode</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that a feasible option for travellers?&nbsp; Still when the router you want to connect with does not have WPS, you still need access to the travelrouter somehow.</p><p>Also look at <a href="http://www.dlink.cc/tag/dir-505">http://www.dlink.cc/tag/dir-505</a> (scroll down to repeater mode)&nbsp; the DIR-505 uses a Atheros AR1311 SoC (unfortunately I have not tested this on my own DIR-505, I now run OpenWRT on it)</p><p>What are the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of OpenVPN vs TOR?&nbsp; I seem to prefer TOR, but maybe OpenVPN has other advantages?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frietpan</strong> on 21 Sep 2015, 23:31)</p>

					<p>Regarding the battery, my HooToo seems to consume about 500 ma/hr based on some real time testing (your mileage may vary).&nbsp; 3000 I would expect be a minimum, 5000 a rough upper end.&nbsp; That should be enough to get through the day.&nbsp; I do not expect it will be on all the time.&nbsp; The battery technology in most device is in the form factor of an AA or AAA if you busted them open (done it), even in your laptops.</p><p>RTC is important for a few reasons.&nbsp; I would like the time to be correct in the logs and some programs like DNScrypt require accurate time to run <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dnscrypt.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dnscrypt.</a>, NTP does appear to update about every 10 minutes.&nbsp; I am not smart enough about the hardware to know if this can be done with out the device being &quot;fully&quot; on.&nbsp; I know most devices have a CR2032 or similar to keep the time right.&nbsp; Exactly what needs power I do not know.&nbsp; I have assumed the main battery can also do this even when powered off.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m wrong.</p><p>Regarding 2 radios, see post 4 in the thread.&nbsp; I am becoming more convinced that a better software solution can at least handle a Router config, if not an AP and relayd.&nbsp; Never used WPS, and do not see it as essential.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a front end in my mind (software solution).&nbsp; It&#039;s a design issue.</p><p>OpenVPN and TOR are different tools and have different purposes.&nbsp; They are complimentary,.&nbsp; Tor hides the connection points, but not the data.&nbsp; VPN hides the data, but not the connections, and to be complete DNScrypt and DNSSEC makes sure the DNS requests are real, and not spoofed.</p><p>I am not really too concerned about the world knowing the end points, but I do want my content secure.&nbsp; And if I route everything through a VPN Service, they really can infer nothing from the end points.</p><p>As for the boxes, I&#039;m a manufacturing guy.&nbsp; I appreciate the time and effort it takes to design, build and support a product.&nbsp; They are not the box OEM, so there is a layer of cost above say GL.inet or NEXX.&nbsp; We also need to face the fact that there is an entire audience of people who have no interest or ability to flash a device, but still want a solution.&nbsp; Actually, I am willing to pay $50-80 to get what I want in a box; this has been a major time suck.&nbsp; Other than GL.iNet, I am not aware of any other vendor including the firmware as stock, and lets not fool ourselves, it was a cost savings to them.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello RangerZ,</p><p>In terms of software, we have something close to what you are looking for. The travel router software we are offering has the following ready to use features;</p><p>VPN Ready</p><p>Works with all latest smartphones, tablets and computers alike.</p><p>Can connect wifi to wifi (on single radio, but we manage the dirty details in our software like managing and scanning connections, disabling station mode if we can&#039;t find any hotspot etc.)</p><p>Can connect over RJ45 cable</p><p>Full usb flash drive control using web interface that works on all platforms. You can do all the common file operations using Iphone, Android, and Windows Phone &gt;=8.1 (no apps required) . This includes uploading files from and to your cell phone. File uploads offer auto retries (useful for large files e-g &gt; 1GB) retries can utilize&nbsp; http file upload continue mode (much like ftp continue).</p><p>Copy Files from one USB flash to another just with your cell phone and the travel router.</p><p>Map android phone as&nbsp; a virtual drive (app required for this feature). This will allow you to manipulate android internal and external sd card just like USB flash.</p><p>Ez File sharing lets you share selected files on your router&#039;s USB flash drive and or Android phone virtual drive with others in 3 modes<br />a)Using hotspot&#039;s wifi<br />b)Using router&#039;s wifi<br />c)Over the internet (Possible even when your travel router does not have public IP address, but you will need our home/office router to get this feature working or our VPN service)<br />Ez File share lets others upload files to selected folder on the USB using any browser capable of uploading files (with your permission).</p><p>Home/Office VPN server router<br />========================<br />Home VPN server router is ready to work with ikev2, ipsecure, openvpn, l2tp, l2tp/ipsec, pptp. That should cover pretty much any cellphone. Just add a remote user account, and you are ready to go with xauthipsec, l2tp/ipsec, pptp. For openvpn and ikev2 you need to download cert and .ovpn file from the router to your cell phone as an extra step.</p><p>We have dual mode support (in select models). i.e the router can act both as the vpn server and client with any combination of protocols. For e-g it may be connected to the vpn server using l2tp/ipsec and to your iphone using Xauth/IPSecure or your Windows phone using IKEv2 simultaneously.</p><p>Lemme know if you are interested.</p>									</div>
