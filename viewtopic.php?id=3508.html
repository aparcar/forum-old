					<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; It turns out my problem was that on my WRT54GS Version 4.0, ports &quot;0 1 2 3&quot; are the 4 LAN ports on the back of the router, and port &quot;4&quot; is the WAN/Internet port.&nbsp; That means the default configuration that the OpenWRT documentation provides with vlan0=&quot;1 2 3 4 5*&quot; and vlan1=&quot;0 5&quot;&nbsp; makes the physical WAN port the port labeled 4.&nbsp; So my guess is that...&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>VLAN/Swith Port 3 = Labeled port 1<br />VLAN/Swith Port 2 = Labeled port 2<br />VLAN/Swith Port 1 = Labeled port 3<br />VLAN/Swith Port 0 = Labeled port 4<br />VLAN/Swith Port 4 = Labeled WAN port</p><p>Although the only one I can verify right now is that the WAN port is actually VLAN PORT 4 and I think that VLAN PORT 0 is the Labeled LAN port 4.</p><p>I discovered this after verifying everything again and again and looking through all the scripts and seeing nothing wrong.&nbsp; Then it just dawned on me the most logical reason I couldnt get an address from the DHCP is that it is not plugged in.&nbsp; I tried every othter LAN port, and when i plugged in port 4 (I think it was) I got an IP from my cable modem.&nbsp; Before that, I saw that when I plugged in to my WAN port I could still connect to the router and get an IP from the routers DHCP.&nbsp; So when I switched the vlans so that<br />vlan0ports=&quot;0 1 2 3 5*&quot; and vlan1ports=&quot;4 5&quot;, everything worked as labeled and expected.&nbsp; </p><p>Oh well... maybe it will help someone else out.&nbsp; I did just&nbsp; buy the router new less than a week ago so maybe something physical has changed... or maybe I&#039;m just a dipshit and misread somewhere that port 0 is supposed to be the WAN port.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jkhax0r</strong> on 2 Dec 2005, 18:54)</p>
