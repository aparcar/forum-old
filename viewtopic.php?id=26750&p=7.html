					<p>Hi, I am considering installing openwrt on my WZR-HP-G301NH. I currently have dd-wrt but the wireless connection is variable on N because of the madwifi atheros drivers.

Do the instructions for WZR-HP-G300NH to install work on the WZR-HP-G301NH? </p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mabawsa</strong> on 30 Apr 2011, 03:53)</p>

					<p>First off: this kind of crap is absolutely infuriating. F#@%ing manufacturers make changes in their hardware that totally bork what worked, without providing any clue in their promotional material. God it pisses me off. I bought this WZR-HP-G300NH explicitly because it was listed as supported by OpenWRT and because it had hardware specs I want. Does it work? Noooo... because apparently it&#039;s actually a 30<strong>1</strong> rather than a 300, even tho&#039; everything that indicates the model SAYS it&#039;s a 300, both on the packaging and in the stock firmware itself. BUT:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rtl_chip_type_select:RTL8366RB</code></pre></div><p>Surprise surprise... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /></p><p>/rant</p><p>Anyway...</p><p>Just wanted to say thanks for all the hard work, and cast my vote for PLEASE solving this issue.

Really need that bandwidth quota management; it kind of amazes me that it&#039;s not a standard feature in all of these third-party firmwares. It&#039;s certainly one of the most needful, judging by how often I see requests for it.
