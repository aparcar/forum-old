					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a v1 WRT55AG, which I believe is a Broadcom chipset.&nbsp; The wiki was pretty unhelpful except to say that it&#039;s unsupported, however further searching on this forum shows that some people have been successful in getting OpenWRT running.</p><p>I&#039;m new to the OpenWRT world...I&#039;ve been using and playing with Sveasoft&#039;s firmware on WRT54GS routers for some time though, but I&#039;m now looking at OpenWRT specifically for support of my WRT55AG.</p><p>The posts I&#039;ve discovered while searching here were tough for me to follow -- </p><p><a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=15446">http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=15446</a></p><p>and</p><p><a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=11817">http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=11817</a></p><p>indicate that people have been able to make it work.&nbsp; What I lack is a specific pointer/instructions to the firmware used to get OpenWRT running on the WRT55AG.&nbsp; As near as I can tell, acoul has several firmware builds on his site and I could not find any decent documentation on which one is appropriate to use for my WRT55AG.&nbsp; I&#039;d like not to brick it on the first attempt. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>So in brief:</p><p>1.&nbsp; Which firmware build, specifically, should I use for my WRT55AG?</p><p>2.&nbsp; Are there any special steps to follow aside from TFTPing the image to the router?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-HJD.</p>									</div>
