					<p>Hi all, </p><p>Sorry if I am asking anything well known to others since I am new to OpenWrt, and I can&#039;t get&nbsp; the answer by searching.</p><p>I just clone the latest copy of code by git clone from github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git, the head commit timestamp is &quot;Tue Aug 30 12:36:58 2016 +0200&quot;. Then &quot;make menuconfig&quot;, Target system set &quot;Ralink RT288x/RT3xxx&quot;, Subtarget is &quot;MT7620 based Profile&quot;, then in Target profile, I can see only one &quot;Default profile&quot;.&nbsp; After compiling, I saw the bin contains a lot, actually I may want only one image, this may consume unnecessary time.&nbsp; The worst, if I add luci to compile, one of the images failed because of size exceeds: <br />&quot;openwrt-ramips-mt7620-ex2700-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin is too big&quot; but this target is not of my concern. </p><p>Alternatively I git clone from git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git&quot;, then interestingly I can see different subtarget profiles there. Looking at the history of this git, it is not as active as that in github, not updated for about two months. What is the relationship for git.openwrt and github/openwrt, how do they sync? Which one should I follow for my personal development? </p><br /><p>Thanks for your time.</p>									</div>
