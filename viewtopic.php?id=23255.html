					<p>What service? or script switches on the PPPD on your case ?<br />and what is its priority ?<br />you can put it to the very last one to start.<br />just as a quick fix.</p><p>look at /etc/init.d/</p><p>Hope this helps.<br />Regards<br />mohnkhan</p>									</div>

					<p>have you checked via ps whether the ppp stuff is still active ? It normally just keeps trying after a certain wait time.<br />What I was trying to say is that these no discovery lines indicate that the line is not up.<br />Log into the modem and look what is going on there. Can you ping the modem itself.? What do the management pages say about the adsl connection ?<br />Is the modem configured as bridge ?</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a boot time issue.&nbsp; There is no way to log into the modem at the time that pppd is starting (during boot).</p><p>All I can say is that after the boot I can login into the modem and the link is up.</p><p>Then if I do an &quot;ifup wan&quot; from the command line ppp0 comes up so that is again confirmation that the modem is up and working OK.</p><p>As I stated previously pppd is running and can always be seen with the ps command.<br />You are apparently not correct when you say that it keeps trying after this error. </p><p>My modem is in bridge mode.</p>									</div>
