					<p>hello,</p><p>i&#039;m using kamikaze 0.9 and have some questions:</p><p>1)&nbsp; currently my router replies to pings from the internet / from the wan interface to my router. how to disable ping replies to pings coming in by the wan interface (lan pings shall still be answered)?</p><p>2) additionally to wpa2 i&#039;d like to restrict access to my wlan by mac addresses. where can i configure this?</p><p>3) what can i use to count the total traffic passing the wan interface (i don&#039;t need a function to limit the traffic or detailed statistics, just a total traffic per month statistic) ? it would be also nice if i could exclude some network areas from this couting e.g. 123.456.789.xxx shouldn&#039;t be counted.</p><p>thank you very much!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>srynoname</strong> on 12 Feb 2008, 01:56)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>1) With iptables you can block ping request with &quot;iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -j DROP&quot;. It tested it works fine. To block only in wan, specify a network with &quot;-i wan&quot; for example but I&#039;m not sure.<br />2) Use a table of rules in iptables for the wlan network adapter with something like: Accept mac x y and z else block. (accept a mac address: iptables -A -i wlan0 INPUT -m mac --mac-source 00:0F:EA:91:04:08 -j DROP) I didn&#039;t try it but I could be something like it.<br />3) Don&#039;t know.</p><p>You can visit this page for more details about the power of Iptable <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO/packet-filtering-HOWTO-7.html">http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/ â€¦ WTO-7.html</a><br />I hope that I helped you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jamesbch</strong> on 15 Feb 2008, 00:03)</p>
