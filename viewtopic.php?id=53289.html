					<p>Hello, My web server is on the same home network as the openwrt router, and I&#039;d like to do this: <a href="http://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=23767#p69732">http://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 767#p69732</a> , i.e. redirect clients that connect to my openwrt router to my server&#039;s local IP rather than its public one, so syncing with the server when devices are at home happens locally rather than on the internet. I use a TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v9, with Barrier Breaker 14.07-rc3<br />So I gather this is supposed to be done through dnsmasq (Network &gt; DHCP and DNS in the web GUI). Unfortunately, I can&#039;t make sense of the information on the wiki page- it&#039;s only for editing the config file manually. Could someone help me find the right settings in the openwrt GUI? I want devices querying the domain oc.benopp.org top be redirected to the server&#039;s local IP. Is it maybe as simple as entering these two values in Network &gt; Hostnames, or is that the wrong place to do that?</p>									</div>
