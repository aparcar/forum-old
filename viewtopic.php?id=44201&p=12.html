					<p>Thanks for the follow up.</p><p>I loaded the STA firmware already. It&#039;s version 0.999something IIRC, checked dmesg output that it loaded on reboot.</p><p>I had both set to WDS, which is how I thought I had it previously, but I don&#039;t doubt your recommendation as I read that several times during my research. I&#039;m going to give that config a shot when I have time. And as to what I&#039;m doing, I use Windows Media Center for my TV and live in a condo community. I get occasional dropouts on 2.4 there are 8 other visible access points on 2.4 in my condo. I use the remote client as a wireless bridge for my xb360. I&#039;m trying hard to avoid learning to pull wire in a house. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile"/></p><p>Setup is Archer C7 as my router, WDR4300 as the bridge. I previously had this working on 2.4 with the wdr4300 and a wr841nd.</p><p>Also thanks to all of you that got this running on the C7.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if the WDR4300 and the C7 are actually WDS compatible with each other. The WDR4300 is only 802.11N on the 5 GHz and running on the ath9k driver (both the 2.4 and the 5 GHz radios), the C7 is 802.11AC on 5 GHz running on ath10k driver with 802.11N at 2.4 GHz on ath9k. The other unit WR841ND is 802.11N on only 2.4 GHz, and ath9k driver.</p><p>Everything that I&#039;ve seen has said that everything has to be just right with each other in order to work in wds mode. There may be enough differences between ath9k and 10k to throw a wrench into your objectives.</p><p>Your best option really is to run a wire, as much of a pain as it is to run. I don&#039;t know if it will work in your condo (you might need some kind of filter at the breaker panel), but have you looked into a powerline ethernet bridge?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I&#039;m a bit of an openwrt fanboy and I recently got a TP-Link Archer C7 v1.1. I&#039;m completely fine with what it does right now, because I just use it as a cheap WLAN-AC accesspoint.</p><p>I&#039;m not so good at speaking english, so I did not quite understand what is going on here in this thread, so here my question:</p><p>Will it be possible to run openwrt on the Archer C7 v1.1 with working WLAN-AC ?</p><p>Greetz</p><p>Audiocrush</p>									</div>

					<p>So, got my v2 today.<br/>Walked in, gave the lady at the front desk my RMA number, got everything swapped out nice and easy.<br/>TPLink is great to deal with.</p><p>Factory firmware lasted just long enough to &quot;upgrade&quot; to openwrt.<br/>The nightly images do NOT include ath10k driver, not sure why that is.... but it led to a weird problem; in the /etc/config/wireless file, radio0 and 1 were backwards. Since the qca9550 was detected on first boot, it got labelled as radio0, then after installing ath10k, the 9880 got called radio1 in that file. After rebooting, radio0 *really was* the 9880, but with the 9550&#039;s configurations, radio1 really was the 9550, but with the 9880&#039;s configuration. Repair that file, and all is well. I have working 2.4 *and* 5 GHz.</p><p>The 9880 is advertising both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.<br/>Ok, so looks like the 2.4 GHz band &quot;works&quot; on the 9880, its just *incredibly* weak.... i.e., it picks up the 9550 at about 51% signal strength and doesn&#039;t pick up anything else.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>definesinsanity</strong> on 15 Apr 2014, 04:04)</p>
