					<p>@jamu: I believe I see the same on ROOter as you do - and agree that there is little logged of apparent relevance. On one occasion (I started seeding 8 or so torrents with upnp enabled) it killed the 2.4 GHz AP point, or so it seemed. On that point, I want to ask you if you have seen 2.4 GHz instabilities, typically after a long uptime - 1 to 2 weeks?</p><p>In case folk don&#039;t know, aside of various LTE &quot;directIP&quot; enabling scripts, ROOter essentially is OpenWrt.....</p>									</div>

					<p>@ryts: Yes, I do believe I saw some wireless instability while I was running the r39076 -based build for several weeks. I remember I had to reboot the router at least once to regain internet connectivity for my PS3, which is connected with wireless. At the same time the wired connection was working fine. This was after at least a week of uptime, if not more.</p><p>I don&#039;t recall seeing any similar wireless problems with the earlier r38458 -based build, which is what I am running now as well. I&#039;ve had this build running for close to two months in total, with virtually no problems. If it weren&#039;t for advancements in the Rooter -project itself, I would not have any immediate need to upgrade.</p>									</div>
