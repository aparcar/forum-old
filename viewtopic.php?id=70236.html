					<p>Hello guys,<br />I am currently persuing my Masters in Digital Electronics and Communication Systems.<br />I am studying on CAPWAP protocol and I wanted to extend my study towards Interoperability of this protocol in the sense my thought is based on &#039;can this protocol be made to be used among some different vendor AP and some other different vendor Controller!&#039;.<br />I studied on how this protocol communicates between AP and Controller and the frame structures of different headers and have a little basics that way.</p><p>I also listened of OpenWRT being so flexible. Could some one give me a detail on what is OpenWRT basically and what all it could do? Could we take it&#039;s help to build up an Interoperable CAPWAP?<br />I searched for the architectures of Access point and WLAN controller as devices but I end up getting the Wireless network architecture. If some one knew better on this, I would appreciate your help if you could give the architectural detail of these in device point of view.<br />I also read that each vendor will have different specifications to his AP and Controllers. What are all the specifications which can be varied is my doubt i read through some of them but not all. Could some of you help involving in the discussion and help my study go further please.<br />with thanks,<br />Tejaswini</p>									</div>
