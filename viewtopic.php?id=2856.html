					<p>No - the restoration utility is a piece of windows software found on the ASUS CD that came with your router.</p><p>Upgrading to OpenWRT using the webinterface will NOT work.</p><p>I have made an installation and setup tutorial for OpenWRT (which is actuately made using an Asus) here: <a href="http://www.macsat.com/OpenWRT/InstallOpenWRT.php">http://www.macsat.com/OpenWRT/InstallOpenWRT.php</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi macsat,</p><p>Thanks for the answer.....<br />I tryied to reset the router like you said, it did not work with tftp, but it did work with the restoration utility <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />But then i got a even bigger problem, the OpenWRT software is installed, and when i try to SSH (with putty) in it ask me for a username and passwd?!? (even the first time).<br />I have not made a username or a passwd, so i dont know what to write......The version i installed is openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx.<br />I also look in your guide and can se that you write that first time it should not ask for a passwd or username........I have tryed with root, root or admin, admin but none of these works <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Do you know what to do when it does this?</p><p>Sincerly,</p><p>Jan</p>									</div>
