					<p>Hi, I&#039;m looking for some vpn solution, but I&#039;d prefer speed over security. I&#039;ve noticed, that there&#039;s openvpn nossl option in menuconfig, though I&#039;d like to avoid plain text, I&#039;d like to have the data a bit encrypted (simple XOR FF or ROT13 could be enough <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> But openvpn is too slow, I&#039;d like to get close to 50mbit with wr841n router.</p><p>What is the fastest vpn link option on openwrt? Openwrt will be on both ends, which package should I choose? I&#039;d like to route all the traffic on site B through the site A, where&#039;s 100/100mbit, so simultaneous upstream and downstream shouldn&#039;t be problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much for complete info. I&#039;m a bit disappointed with the speed though, I have expected more from wr841n V8 @533 MHz, I should get close to 30mbit with pptp, but that sucks. I will have to settle with openvpn nossl <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Is it possible use some fast encryption with openvpn? I don&#039;t know if that even exists, I mean something like AES32, or whatever <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> AES128 or blowfish is uselessly strong, complex and slow.</p>									</div>

					<p>blowfish would be the fastest on MIPS. Probably thats the reason openvpn selects it by default. CPUs which have built in instruction set for AES encyption such as intel, Freescale, can encrypt/decrypt AES&nbsp; faster than blowfish. Besides that don&#039;t expect too much from the low powered CPU&#039;s used in routers.&nbsp; Openvpn will always run slower than lets say IPSecure, because OpenVPN runs in user mode which adds overhead and hence slower performance as compared to IPSecure which runs in kernel mode. If you know C programming, you can encrypt the traffic using something as simple as xoring the bytes with your predefined shared key to encrypt the traffic. For this you will have to modify openvpn source and compile it for MIPS. However you should first test the performance using openvpn&nbsp; without encryption. What ever performance you get without encryption will be your upper limit and you can decide if its worth it to add your custom encryption.</p>									</div>

					<p>Pretty much yes. All routers @ mips 400&nbsp; will give you similar results. However performance may be impacted by the speed of memory being used and the load of other programs running on the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks ron, that sounds like a good idea. Making c apllication which would xor a pipe is no problem for me, but compile openvpn with it is <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>So I wanted to test openvpn-nossl, but all the guides I found use encryption. How can I set up openvpn tunnel without encryption and keys? If there&#039;s not a guide, I won&#039;t figure it out myself, I&#039;m pretty far from what&#039;s called a linux guru <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>you can disable encryption using the option</p><p>--cipher none</p><p>This option can be included as command line option for both client and server or you can include it in the options file if you have one using command line option</p><p>--config yourfile</p><p>if you include --cipher none in the config file, omit the -- at the beginning i. e use cipher none</p><p>Only the client side certificate can be omitted, openvpn requires that you use server side certificate for verification.</p><p>you can get openvpn help just by typing openvpn with no options.</p><p>And you are right, ar71xx do not have any special instruction set for AES or any other encryption.

					<p>Thanks again. Maybe I will go with pptp, I think there should be option to disable encryption too and when it is driven by kernel, it should be the fastest way. Good to have two options, I hope I&#039;ll manage to set up at least one of them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
