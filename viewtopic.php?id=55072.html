					<p>i have a really strange issue every time i flash openwrt it changes my wan ip to the same one? what i mean is right now on the factory tplink ip is say as an example&nbsp; 179.73.278.116 (not my real ip) but then when i flash openwrt it always changes to 168.77.191.210 (again just an example) i even called my isp and had them release the ip and reset the network and send a new ip (they tried 3 times) and on the factory tplink firmware i saw the new ip address but then i flashed openwrt and it went right back to the same one it showed on openwrt prior to them issuing a new ip. i really needed a new ip and just could not get it to change while the archer c7 v2 was on openwrt even the techs at my isp were stumped. its like the openwrt firmware was stuck on that ip address did not make a hint of sense.</p><p>any thoughts to why that happened? sorry if i confused anyone</p>									</div>
