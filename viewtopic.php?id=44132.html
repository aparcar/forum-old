					<p>If I let a client that is behind a firewall dial into my VPN server, could the computers on the server side network access the computers on the client side? I imagine this would involve bridging adapters or, setting up another vpn server on the client side that runs through the first vpn.</p><p>If it helps the client behind the firewall would be the openwrt device.<br />The VPN server is running on a Ubuntu host, this is connected to another private.<br />The firewalled network is behind that has a capacity of 100Mbps parrallel. During work hours there are usually 400 computers using the internet. (Crazy I know, we&#039;re upgrading to gigabit soon) So taking this latency and bandwith issue, would a VPN be even feasible?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sure it is (easilly) possible, but it is highly dependend on how you configure it and what you main goal is.</p><p>Also 400 computers doesn&#039;t directly mean a lot of bandwidth, or you probably have a lot of employees doing something the shouldn&#039;t do&nbsp; (wathching youtube e.g.)</p><p>But with a lot of users I would go with an openswan solution, but it is the pain in the neck to set it up correctly (that why I bought a book on the subject a long time ago). Or the more easier one openvpn.</p><p>For openVPN be sure to checkout the wiki here, and read also the howto from openvpn for a lot more explanation on how <a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html">http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-sourc â€¦ howto.html</a></p><p>p.s. The tutorial/wiki page here on openvpn has the exmaple how to let a client connect, and have it access the complete network it connected to. (not too sure if that is what you wan&#039;t with a cooprate network, but it works)<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a></p>									</div>

They have a PPTP VPN already setup. I do not however want computers from the corporate side to be able to access the sattelite office. I assume what needs to happen is the office side needs to get an IP from corporate. I cannot open ports from corporate hence why I assume VPN is the way to go.</p>									</div>

					<p>I presume that you want to connecting client is an openwrt device? Also do you have access to the firewall because to do it properly you need a static route. (or run the client on the same device as the firewall).</p><p>If that is not possible it would really help to know what device you are connecting to on the other end of the vpn tunnel, so that traffic from the client could be redirected to it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the previous answers misunderstood the question. Somebody who&#039;s more versed than me please correct me if I&#039;m wrong. But I&#039;ll go out on a limb here and say:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>dpsi wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>If I let a client that is behind a firewall dial into my VPN server, could the computers on the server side network access the computers on the client side?</p></blockquote></div><p>Computers, as in plural: No, not out of the box.</p><p>Of course, it can access and receive an answer from the VPN client machine itself, that is kind of the purpose, and it goes both ways unless the services on the client machine are configured to answer on the local network interface only.</p><p>However, other machines in the client&#039;s network would not know about the VPN tunnel that a single machine in their network opened. They would probably be able to receive requests that originated from the VPN tunnel, but they would not know where to send a response to a request to -- unless the individual machines (or their gateway) were deliberately instructed to send responses back through the VPN tunnel that was opened by the VPN client&#039;s machine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 12 May 2013, 05:37)</p>
