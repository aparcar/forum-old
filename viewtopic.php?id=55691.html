					<p>That won&#039;t work for me. It is for stick modems, not for hilink.<br />HiLink firmware transforms modem from usb-serial device to virtual ethernet adapter.<br />And dmesg &quot;said&quot; that cdc-ether is the right one driver.

					<p>No, the kmod-usb-net-cdc-ncm package, I think, is needed for HiLink devices. (there are a few links about describing set-up of Huawei dongles and some on the dev: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15328">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15328</a>) So instead of the device appearing as, say, eth1 it will appear as wwan0. I find that more helpful anyhow.</p><p>Give it a try. In CC there is a specific package for Huawei cdc devices (kmod-usb-net-huawei-cdc-ncm), which helps with the confusion, but with BB the above should work.</p><p>I got my device working under Debian (using cdc-ncm) and then realised that a similar set of packages were needed in OpenWRT to make it work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tristanc</strong> on 10 Feb 2015, 12:47)</p>

					<p>Oh, and I think your issue in the OP might also be related to missing a package to remount USB devices in a hot-plug fashion. I remember reading somewhere the need for block-mount and / or udev to ensure usb devices inserted after boot were dealt with correctly.</p><p>Also, make sure your /etc/config/network file is edited to deal with eth1 or wwan1 so it brings it up looking for an IP from a DHCP server (if it is like my device it will be given 192.168.1.100 and the gateway will be 192.168.1.1).</p>									</div>

					<p>It is stable......enough. Somehow (i have no any idea) I found my /etc/init.d/usbmode disabled today.

I:* If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=02(comm.)

Class drivers have many advantages.&nbsp; One of the most important is the ability to support future devices.</p><p>Then there is the vendor specific class (ff), intended for devices which doesn&#039;t match any of the predefined classes. Such devices will need device specific drivers, making support usually lag behind.&nbsp; But there are excptions: Huawei use their own class scheme based on the subclass and protocol fields.&nbsp; This allows the huawei-cdc-ncm driver to act as sort of a Huawei specfic &quot;class driver&quot;.</p><p>And RNDIS is really a class defintion, but Microsoft never defined it properly through the USB-IF so it doesn&#039;t have it&#039;s own class codes.&nbsp; But there are a limited set of non-standard codes which identify RNDIS functions.</p><p>So, to answer your question:</p><p> cdc-ether is a CDC ECM class (02/06/00) driver<br /> cdc-ncm is a CDC NCM class (02/0d/00) driver<br /> huawei-cdc-ncm is a Huawei vendor specific driver matching some of their &quot;well known&quot; NCM like functions, like ff/02/16<br /> rndis is an RNDIS &quot;class&quot; driver, mathcing e.g. 02/02/ff devices</p><p>All of these drivers do further probing after the intial descriptor matching, verifying that the device actually is supported by that driver.&nbsp; This helps a lot of you use the ability to dynamically add explicit USB device IDs to a driver.</p>									</div>
