					<p>By the way, I just confirmed the USB-TTL adaptor is definitely working, using same config (only baud rate is changed in minicom), access to raspberry pi 2 via serial console is working flawlessly, login and command line control are all working as expected.<br />So did I miss some actions by connecting Nexx WT3020 serial console and during router boot?</p>									</div>
