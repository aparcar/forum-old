					<p>Hi,<br />Me and a friend have been working quite a lot lately to get my newly purchased HLK-RM04 chips to work as was intended when I got it. However, now when most is finally done, we cannot seem to use the GPIO ports at all.<br />The RM04 have quite few IO pins to actually play around with, and regardless of what we do, export just gives us Invalid Argument. We have tried getting gpio-1 (I2S D), gpio-2 (I2S C), gpio-7 (RTS) and gpio-9 (CTS) to work with no luck.<br />After checking the output of dmesg, we see it failed with status -22 (all of the tried ones).<br />(Full dmesg: <a href="http://pastebin.com/M2a6G6ZT">http://pastebin.com/M2a6G6ZT</a> )<br />Someone suggested enabling them as gpio-mux by changing the dts&nbsp; file&nbsp; &nbsp;(original: <a href="http://pastebin.com/rqcepPNy">http://pastebin.com/rqcepPNy</a> , include rt5350: <a href="http://pastebin.com/rqcepPNy">http://pastebin.com/rqcepPNy</a> ) by changing line 62 to <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ralink,group = &quot;jtag&quot;,&quot;i2c&quot;,&quot;spi&quot;,&quot;uart&quot;,&quot;uartlite&quot;,&quot;uartf&quot;;</code></pre></div><p>But with equal absence of success.<br />Do anyone have any suggestions on how to get the previously stated gpio to work?</p><p>//Regards, me</p>									</div>
