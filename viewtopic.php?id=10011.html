					<p>Hi there !</p><p>I&#039;ve got 2 Sercomm IP806GB Router here and wan&#039;t to put OpenWRT onto them (i just have them for testing purpose. If they are destroyed during the openwrt installation noone cares ;-) ).<br />I&#039;ve already build an openwrt-ar7-2.4-squashfs.bin </p><p>I&#039;ve read the TableOfHardware and found the Sercomm IP806GB as an aka to ALL0277DSL.</p><p>The ALL0277DSL is AR7 based and has got an Marvell 88E6060 switch chip. So long the Sercomm iss the same.<br />The ALL0277DSL has an TI ACX111 wireless chipset and here differs the Sercomm which has an TI TNETW1130.<br />So the Sercomm seems not to be 100% the same as the ALL0277DSL.</p><p>As i looked through the TOH i found the Aztech DSL600EW which has the same Marvell 88E6060 an the TI TNETW1130<br />and i was quite surprised as i read it was supported. </p><p>Ok back to putting OpenWRT on this Box. The internal Webserver has an firmware-upgrade option but it rejects my selfbuild OpenWRT (wrong/missing Headers ?)<br />and during the bootup there seems to be no tftp server running. (tried to put the firmware via tftp-hpa with rexmt 1 like i did when flashing my siemens se505)</p><p>gaining ftp accecs during adam boot weren&#039;t possible. (maybe it doesn&#039;t use adam?)</p><p>Serial/JTAG Connectors aren&#039;t there (soldered) but i found an unsoldered port which is labeled JP603. It has 6 unsoldered pins (jtag needs 7 so maybe this is an console or usb port ??)</p><p>Now what can i do ?<br />How can i gain acces to to any shell (the netgear setupg.cgi?todo=debug trick doesn work although there is a setup.cgi which accepts todo as an argument)<br />How can i find out if the IP806GB is the same Hardware as the Aztech ?<br />And if it is the same what build can i put on it (according to the TOH it is supported... supported means supported by whiterussian but whiterussian has no Ar7 builds right ?)</p><p>thx 4 any help</p><p>EDIT: I&#039;ve found an folder in the svn tree under /target/linux/ar7-2.4/image/sercomm ... does it have anything to do with the sercomm routers ? inside there is an Adam2.bin ... is this an patch for the adam2 bootloader on the sercomm ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Metalmonster</strong> on 22 Mar 2007, 16:29)</p>
