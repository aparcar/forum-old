					<p>I have Kamikaze 8.09.2 bcrm 2.4 with the luci-app-qos and qos-scripts packages installed. I found that those packages added this screen - <a href="http://imgur.com/uAWHw.png">http://imgur.com/uAWHw.png</a>, and I&#039;ve got a few questions. I&#039;ve searched a lot online, but couldn&#039;t find answers to these.</p><p>If several rules fit a single connection, do they all apply to it, or does only the first (or last) matching rule found take effect?</p><p>What is the bytes received column? I figure that would allow me to let short web page requests be prioritized over longer ones and other connections, but I don&#039;t know what it wants me to enter there. For a rule to only match connections under 1500 bytes, would I put &quot;1500&quot;, &quot;-1500&quot;, or &quot;&lt;1500&quot;? Would that be a good number? Or does bytes received only measure individual packets, which all are probably under 1500 bytes anyway, making that a useless rule?</p><p>Is it possible to configure the qos rules so programs such as torrents can run with all of the bandwidth they can when things aren&#039;t busy, but be low enough priority that about anything else can take nearly all the bandwidth away, such as for online gaming? I&#039;ve experimented a bit but I always end up with a lot of lag just like before I tried to set up QoS at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Take a look at Gargoyle:<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com">www.gargoyle-router.com</a></p><p>It is a web interface for OpenWrt (Kamikaze).&nbsp; And it already has a very good QoS completely configured.&nbsp; You just have to set parameters that fit your needs.</p><p>If you don&#039;t need LUCI to tune every single option of your router, Gargoyle is a very nice alternative.&nbsp; And if necessary you can always tune all stuff by ssh.</p>									</div>
