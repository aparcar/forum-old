					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have a question regarding the VLAN config on the Backfire OpenWRT (WRT54GL).</p><p>Current Situation: I have a ZyXEL USG 20w Firewall running at home. The WLAN is divided into my private WLAN and into a Guest WLAN. Both WLANs are running in a seperate Subnet and are also seperated from the LAN. The USG is supporting VLAN.</p><p>I have also an old WRT54GL here, flashed with Backfire. Is the following appoach possible.</p><p>*) Can I configue on the WRT54GL on one of the LAN (or the WAN Port) a network, supporting to receive and transmit 3 different VLANs to the USG?<br />*) One VLAN should be distributed to the remaining free LAN ports, supporting the LAN from the USG.<br />*) One VLAN should be used for the private WLAN<br />*) One VLAN should be used for the Guest VLAN</p><p>No firewall or dhcp is needed, both should be done by the USG.</p><p>Best Regards,<br />Johannes</p>									</div>
