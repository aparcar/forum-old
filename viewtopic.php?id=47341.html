					<p>I think I might have stumpled with an important issue...<br />For the past few days I&#039;ve been trying to set up an openvpn-polarssl server on my router.<br />There&#039;s a step that wasn&#039;t working, that was with the /etc/config/openvpn file, that in the beggining creates a tun device with</p><p>option &#039;enable&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />option &#039;port&#039; &#039;1194&#039;<br />option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;udp&#039;<br />option &#039;dev&#039; &#039;tun&#039;</p><p>This interface wasn&#039;t beeing created, and in the process of googling, I stumbled upon a post about doing logread<br />An error came up, about the openvpn daemon, saying it wouldn&#039;t start because it couldn&#039;t find the dh2048.pem file in /etc/openvpn.</p><p>Well, in every tutorial I&#039;ve found, I create the DH with build-dh, but it creates (among others), a dh1024.pem file!! I changed the name to dh2048.pem and the openvpn could startup fine and create the tun0 interface associated.<br />Another problem is with the comp_lzo parameter. It can&#039;t be 1 or 0. It has to be &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;undefined&quot;.</p><p>Now, I used another command to try and create a proper dh2048.pem file, which is<br />openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048</p><p>Don&#039;t know if this is the right command, hope someone will point in the right direction...<br />I&#039;m using openvpn-polarssl.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MataRatos</strong> on 15 Nov 2013, 11:33)</p>

At least I havent&#039; seen where that conf is... Or is it another line I have to add?</p><p>I&#039;m doing some tests so see if I can get this right...</p>									</div>

					<p>FINNALY!!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Now, doing build-ca and build-dh created dh2048.pem, but before was doing dh1024.pem... And the /etc/config/openvpn file has a line to config this.<br />I was doing this at 2 a.m. and having to work the next day, so maybe I was doing something wrong. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Important thing is to set the comp_lzo to yes or no, not 1 or 2, or the daemon wont start... Check it with &quot;logread&quot;.</p><p>Another thing I&#039;ve noticed in the end is that I created a firewall rule with LuCIto allow UDP port 1194 to VPN, but I must have done something wrong because in the /etc/config/firewall file, it was like this:<br />config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enabled &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;1194&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;OpenVPN&#039;</p><p>So it opened TCP port, and I was getting connection refused... Maybe it was something I done wrong, but if you run into this issue, check for this.</p><p>Hope this will help someone also. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MataRatos</strong> on 15 Nov 2013, 18:53)</p>
