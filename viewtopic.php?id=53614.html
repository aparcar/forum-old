					<p>Hello,<br />I compiled OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r43055 / LuCI Trunk (git-14.294.77948-ecb0c2f) for Archer C7 v2.<br />I used scripts made by hnyman for WNDR3700 with little changes.<br />I found following issues:<br />1. Radios were not detected at the boot. Had to force detecting again by:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; removing /etc/config/wireless file<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; giving command &quot;wifi detect &gt; /etc/config/wireless&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and it worked<br />2. wlan leds not working.</p><p>Does anybody have a solution for wlan leds?</p><p>Googoled and found that ticket #18188 by morfik was reporting how to get the wlan5g led working and the lack of triggering for wlan2g.<br />Waiting for ticket resolution.</p><p>Sergio</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sergiosatellite</strong> on 26 Oct 2014, 13:10)</p>
