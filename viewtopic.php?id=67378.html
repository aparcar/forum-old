					<p>Hi! I&#039;m currently in possession of a ZyXEL ADSL2+ wireless routers. I inherited it from my sister, and as far as I can tell, there&#039;s no reason not to flash it with OpenWRT. It has a Broadcom BCM63168 xDSL IAD SoC, 512 MiB of NAND Flash, 512 MiB DDR2 RAM and 1 x USB 2.0 port. I&#039;m trying to get as much information about the device as possible, and I&#039;m lost as of where the serial / J-TAG pin layout of the device would be. How does one normally figure this stuff out?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gagaman</strong> on 5 Sep 2016, 07:48)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not currently allowed as a new user to post links, but I created a device page and uploaded PCB and casing photos to the Media Manager. As soon as I can post links I&#039;ll reference them here.</p>									</div>
