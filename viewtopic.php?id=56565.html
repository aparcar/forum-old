					<p>When playing around with network/firewall settings there is a good chance you lock yourself out of your router. Here is an instruction how I make sure to get a working config again if that happens.</p><p>1) install openwrt<br />2) ssh to router<br />3) cp -r /etc/config /etc/config.orig<br />4) vim /root/restore.sh<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
rm -rf /etc/config.modified
mv /etc/config /etc/config.modified
cp -r /etc/config.orig /etc/config
reboot</code></pre></div><p>5) chmod u+x /root/restore.sh<br />6) vim /etc/crontabs/root<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># m h dom mon dow command
59 22 * * * /root/restore.sh</code></pre></div><p>7) /etc/init.d/cron restart</p><br /><p>and now you can change stuff in /etc/config and if you break something the system will reset itself to the initial config at 22:59 (10:59pm) of course the router has to be powered on for that to happen.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davewood</strong> on 31 Mar 2015, 17:01)</p>

					<p>If you make some changes and are satisfied that they are working, remember to recopy the config to /etc/config.orig.<br />Otherwise you will constantly revert to your original setup every night at 22:59 wheher you want to or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s one of the many advantages of configuring <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">extroot</a>. Mess something up and all you have to do is power down, remove the extroot device, mount is on a Linux PC and fix it. No waiting for a cron job to kick in.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vernonjvs</strong> on 18 Jan 2016, 08:00)</p>

					<p>Great idea! </p><p>I think implementation could be improved tho. As is, this script would cause the reboot wherever needed or not each day at 22:59. Would be great to actually check if there&#039;re difference between the /etc/config and /etc/config.orig which would require the restore/reboot.</p><p>Also bear in mind that if you mess up the networking enough for the router to not be able to receive the time from ntp servers, the restore/reboot wouldn&#039;t happen at 22:59, it would happen almost 23 hours after you start the router. So maybe checking the uptime instead of the actual time would work better.</p>									</div>
