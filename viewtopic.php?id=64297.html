					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m running trunk on a set of Archer C7&#039;s that are forming a small mesh network. I&#039;d like to have automated monitoring of the whole mesh to get some performance metrics on my changes to the mesh software.</p><p>However, it runs on ipv6, and as far as I can tell the basic snmpd package only sniffs the ipv4 routing table. I would like to add functionality to the snmp agent so that I can retrieve more information. I&#039;m fine with coding and modifying the snmpd package if I have to. </p><p>Where should I start with this? I&#039;m fairly new to network management and I&#039;m interested in expanding the monitoring tools to the mesh software.</p><p>Alternatively if you know of a way to just add the ipv6 MIB to the snmp packages (or I completely missed them somehow) that would be even better.</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>									</div>
