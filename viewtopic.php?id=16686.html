					<p>Yesterday I found out I forgot the password for my wrt54g running the latest white russian. Fine, I thought. I then followed instructions in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ys/WRT54GL</a> and boot it up in the failsafe mode, typed mount_root so I could do changes, and then tried to change the password:</p><p>root@(none):/jffs$ df -h<br />Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Used Available Use% Mounted on<br />none&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.0k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.0M&nbsp; &nbsp;0% /tmp<br />/dev/mtdblock/4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.3M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.3M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;60.0k&nbsp; 96% /jffs<br />/jffs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.9M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.9M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /<br />root@(none):/jffs$ passwd<br />Changing password for root<br />New password:<br />Retype password:<br />passwd: cannot create &#039;/etc/passwd+&#039;: No space left on device<br />passwd: cannot update password file /etc/passwd<br />root@(none):/jffs$ </p><p>Why would I not have free space in /jffs? How can I clean it? I even tried moving /etc/passwd-, which seems to be the original passwd file without a root passwd, to /etc/passwd and it still barked it did not have enough free space. vi fared no better. What can I try next short of wipe and reinstall?</p>									</div>
