					<p>Hi everyone.Recently i&#039;ve managed to burn my mr3020.The u5 chip is done,and i&#039;ve searched only the part to replace it myself.I think is a SN74AHC1GU04DBVR(datasheet:http://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?literatureNumber=scls343q) or a TC1185(datasheet:http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/21335c.pdf) but i&#039;m not sure.I&#039;ve connected 2 pins from the u5 with a pice of wire and it&#039;s working , but it gets hot.I&#039;ve tried to power it up from 3.7v and 5.5v and the problem with hot chips is the same.The usb port gets about 4 volts and it&#039;s decreasing slowly to 0v.The IC is like the one found on wr703n on U6.So i hope anyone can help me.Sorry for my english,but you get the point..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eightysixphp</strong> on 18 Jun 2013, 13:42)</p>

					<p>If the purpose of U5 chip on MR3020 is the same as U6 on 703n, then you can safely desolder it and short pins 1 and 5 on the board. You will lose the ability to turn off the usb device from software but as a advantage you will get a free GPIO port on pin 4.</p><p>PS: Look at <a href="http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/">http://squonk42.github.io/TL-WR703N/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.I&#039;ve already done this.But the board is getting to hot on the flash mem and the soc.The safest thing to do in my opinion is to replace u5 chip with a identical IC.I don&#039;t know..And the thing is that the router power itself up ,but the wireless it&#039;s not working...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,<br />may be it&#039;s too late... Anyway, I&#039;ve just burned my TL-MR3020 too. The U5 chip popped up making smoke, I think because I supplied the router with 5.26V through P1 pins (it may be too hi).</p><p>So, I found this post and read the docs linked by strby. Thank you very much for the link and thanks to the author of that documentation.</p><p>Now, looking on my board and comparing it with the circuit schemas, it seems to me that the U5 of the TL-MR3020 corresponds to the U5 of the TL-WR703N and not to the U6.<br />eightysixphp, U6 may be just a bypassable switch, but <strong>U5 is part of the 3.3V DC/DC converter circuit</strong>!</p><p>Please tell me if I&#039;m wrong.<br />Otherwise, this may be a solution:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>find and buy an external 3.3V DC/DC converter that takes in 5V (check max current limits) </p></li><li><p>remove U5 (the burned DC/DC) and L14 (inductor); </p></li><li><p>solder a wire in the place of L14, on the pad directly connected to the 3V3 line; </p></li><li><p>connect the wire to the external 3.3V DC/DC (also connect the GND to any free pad, or to the pin in P1)</p></li></ol>									</div>

					<p>Yes, the chips referenced as U5 and U6 on the TL-MR3020 and TL-WR703N are the same (U6 is on top side on the TL-MR3020 PCB, bottom side on TL-WR703N):<br /></p><ul><li><p>U5 (marking: BWMM7AG) is an <a href="http://www.ame.com.tw/Product/Datasheet/AME5258.pdf">AME5258</a> step-down 3.3 V switching voltage regulator , along with the L14 ferrite-core self, C112 input filter ceramic capacitor, C109 output filter ceramic capacitor and feedback circuit R99 / R100 / C106</p></li><li><p>U6 (marking: 16GBC) is an USB power distribution switch <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps2051b.pdf">TPS2051B</a> clone, with its related C119 capacitor</p></li></ul><p>So if you blew up U5, you just blew up the main 5V =&gt; 3.3V DC/DC buck converter. Is your router still working when you apply 5V to its output?!?</p><p>You may well have sent your TL-MR3020 to the Paradise of blown routers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Anyway, the AME5258 is a Chinese chip that you won&#039;t find on the retail market, except in China.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 1 Oct 2013, 17:26)</p>

					<p>Supposing that U5 is the only blown part, what do you think about connecting an external 3.3V power supply, as I said above?<br />I can find a lot of suitable 5V =&gt; 3.3V DC/DC on electronics online stores.<br />Or do you thing it maybe easier to replace the U5 chip with an equivalent one, instead of connecting a complete (more expensive) external circuit?</p><p>It&#039;s not important, but note that the U5 chip may differ from one board to another. My U5 shows the code &quot;IC2BG&quot;, but the same pin layout.</p><p>(After the accident, the LEDs of my router didn&#039;t light up anymore--in the first 1 o 2 seconds, at least--, so I immediately supposed that the burned part was about the power supply. I haven&#039;t done any other experiment because I&#039;m afraid of burning the rest of the circuits.<br />I don&#039;t understand what eightysixphp says about &quot;the router power itself up&quot;.<br />Maybe he simply read 5V on a test point?)</p>									</div>

					<p>DC/DC converters are not interchangeable.</p><p>Feeding +5V to the delicate AR9331 with 2.5V-tolerant GPIOs and +3.3V normal VDD usually have catastrophic effects on the whole board <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>My guess is that it is already too late, as this voltage level for just a fraction of a second is enough to kill most chips onboard.</p><p>I suggest you to find a new (used?) router, and not hook anything above +3.3V to it, or even +2.5V for the GPIOs.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the reply.</p><p>Today I succesfully tested my burned TL-MR3020 using an external 3.3V power supply.<br />I did what I previously written... The U5 chip was the only blown part and the rest of the circuit was miraculously saved.<br />The test: I connected my PC to the TL-MR3020 used as WiFi AP. I was able to access the Luci administration page.</p><p><strong>My problem is solved.</strong><br />In the next days I&#039;ll provide further details and photos.</p>									</div>
