					<p>Guys,</p><p>Who are the package maintainers?</p><p>I would like apsupsd to be included in daily build. Developers from the project said that package maintainers of openwrt should include their source code as it is free to download.</p><p>&quot;..We can&#039;t &quot;push&quot; our source code on anyone. It is freely available for download. You need to ask the OpenWRT guys to please update to the latest version of the source...&quot;</p><p>Could you please help?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still a beginner regarding package maintenance so I needed some extra time but it&#039;s now part of the daily build in trunk showing up eventually for the different archs. You may use it from there (probably only on a trunk firmware) or you may build it yourself for BB using the feed from <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/apcupsd.">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tre … t/apcupsd.</a><br />I only copied over the old scripts and config files and just referenced the new upstream version. Please take a look specifically for USB which I did not test yet. I guess I&#039;ll work over it anyway so please submit possible improvements. You find my address in the Makefile.</p>									</div>
