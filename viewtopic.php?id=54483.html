					<p>I&#039;ve just managed to compile my own image from the git repository, complete with most packages (I&#039;ve made LuCI built-in, as I would have installed it anyway). Using xubuntu 12.04.4 as build system. In menuconfig you have to select &quot;ramips&quot; as target with &quot;mt7620&quot; as subtarget to get the images for wt3020 built. You also need to weed out a number of packages for which building is currently broken, as you can see at <a href="http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/broken_packages/ramips.mt7620/">http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/broken … ps.mt7620/</a> I have encountered exactly the same problems as buildbot. Some of them are surmontable (a couple of packages sources cannot be downloaded during the build, probably a server issue as I was able to download them in a browser, then the build would continue after I placed the package in the dl/ directory); others are plain broken and I&#039;ve simply disabled them by editing the config file. </p><p>BTW here&#039;s my .config:<br />(uh-oh I tried to paste my .config but apparently I&#039;m exceeding maximum post size - let me see what I can do about that)<br />-trying to upload the config and images somewhere-</p><p>I installed the 8M image and it seems to be working just fine CHAOS CALMER (Bleeding Edge, r43591)</p><br /><p>edit:<br />config <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107843342/.config">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107843342/.config</a><br />factory install <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107843342/openwrt-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-8M-squashfs-factory.bin">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107 … actory.bin</a><br />sysupgrade <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107843342/openwrt-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-8M-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107 … pgrade.bin</a></p><br /><p>BTW I&#039;ve seen a few questions in other threads on how to install OpenWRT on this device. If you have one with the default firmware installed, use the web interface to flash the &quot;factory install&quot; image. If you have already installed OpenWRT on it and are looking to upgrade to a newer release, use the &quot;sysupgrade&quot; image - either in LuCI&#039;s web interface, or by netcat, scp or any of the methods here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a></p><p>I have used both flashing of a factory image from the default firmware, and scp to upgrade and both worked fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stamasd</strong> on 11 Dec 2014, 05:56)</p>
