					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I have always wanted to try to hook up a computer to a lawn mower and see how well it could manuver the mower.&nbsp; OpenWRT and a supported router seems like an excellent unit to attatch to the mower because it is small, low power, and in a fairly well sealed box.&nbsp; It also has wireless capabilities, allowing most of the processing to be done on a desktop/laptop machine, with the mower acting like a dumb terminal...</p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has used openwrt with a supported router for controlling equipment?&nbsp; In my case, what would be the best way of controlling the steering and throttle (assuming a self propelled push mower)?&nbsp; I guess I would have to use a serial or usb port to interface with small electric motors to controll the wheels, etc?&nbsp; </p><p>Ben</p>									</div>

					<p>During the LUG-Camp in Wuppertal/Germany there were three guys named Jan, Peter and Daniel who presented a really-really-really cool WRT+Atmel+Jeep Hummer model, where the Hummer was steered by a WLAN client...</p><p>I&#039;ve made a photo of the scenario, but sadly it died due to a memory stick problem, so we can only hope the guys show up and tell themselves.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi...&nbsp; this sounds fun!<br />in my paltry experience, a parallel port would make this much easier than a serial port.&nbsp; A parallel port provides 8 lines for controlling relays and (4 i think?) lines for sensing relay states.&nbsp; </p><p>if you&#039;re not sure what I&#039;m getting at, you can send a specially-crafted byte to a parallel port&nbsp; to turn each of the 8 bits/relays to the position you require, but a serial port would send all those eight bits serially... one after the other.&nbsp; It would seem you&#039;d need more chips outside the serial port, on the lawnmower side, to allow it to decipher the wrt&#039;s instructions, than you would for a parallel port.&nbsp; On the other hand, you might need more chips to implement a parallel port in a wrt than a serial port.&nbsp; not sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>... are there any WRT-compatible boxes out there that have a parallel port? Otherwise, why not build a small interface with - say - an Atmel AVR, hook it up to the serial port (wouldn&#039;t even need the Max232 chip for voltage adjustment), then use the AVR I/O lines? That way, you could build a minimal protocol between the WRT and the Atmel to do lots of fun stuff ... (FYI ... Mega163 e.g. has a total of 32 (!) I/O lines, including 8 A/D capable lines, 2 interrupt-capable lines, hardware RS232, ...)</p><p>D@mn, giving myself ideas here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I believe there is an asus box with a parallel port?&nbsp; Unfortunatly I&#039;m not much of a hardware guy, I&#039;ve always been interested in the software side of the lawnmower problem.&nbsp; As I&#039;m mowing my mind tends to think of different ways the task could be automated.</p><p>This is why I had asked if anyone has used OpenWRT to &#039;control&#039; something.&nbsp; It seems like a fairly powerful, rather inexpensive, computer.&nbsp; </p><p>Another interesting application would be in a car.&nbsp; It could play MP3&#039;s from a USB drive to a USB soundcard.&nbsp; You could even upload your songs to your car while you are sitting in your house.&nbsp; Or it could share a cell phone internet connection for its passengers.&nbsp; This would use a USB bluetooth interface to a bluetooth enabled cell phone.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can drive most servos and motors using a parallel port, see <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ih/doc/par/">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ih/doc/par/</a> for more info. I&#039;ve managed to use an old 286 to control LEDs this way, yet to experiment with anything more exciting. </p><p>You could also connect a Basic Stamp (<a href="http://www.parallax.com">http://www.parallax.com</a>) to a serial port on a wrt54g or other broadcom router. This has lots of general purpose I/O ports and you can just use 2 of these as send and recieve lines to a serial port, the rest can connect to any servos you need. You program them via a Basic style language which is pretty easy to use. What i&#039;d suggest doing is have a load of simple commands which the wrt54g sends over the serial line to the Basic Stamp which then turns on the appropriate servo/motor.</p>									</div>
