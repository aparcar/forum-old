					<p>Hello Everyone,</p><p>Earlier today Metai helped me sort out my mr3020 issues here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51318">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=51318</a> I wanted to use Attitude Adjustment not Barrier Breaker which I had flashed to the mr3020</p><p>After setting up Mongosse and following this guide here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020</a> the tp-link attempts to connect Mongoose http server running on my local machine to retrieve the file.&nbsp; I have set the IP address and Port number and Disabled the firewall.</p><p>Using wget:&nbsp; &quot;IP address&quot; &amp;&nbsp; &quot;filename.bin&quot; I recieve the following error - wget: can&#039;t open &quot;filename.bin&quot; Read-only file system</p><p>I have followed the instructions yet I am dumbfounded why this does not work, after a few searches I found that other users have had trouble downgrading from BB to AA however I did not find the answer, if anyone has had a similar experience or knows how to rectify this situation I would be very grateful if you were to share your insight.</p><p>Thanks in Advance</p><p>Cheers caps</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re talking about <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020#downgrade.attitute.adjustment.from.trunk">these instructions</a>, the instructions are incomplete. With the first command, wget is trying to save the downloaded image into the current directory. After telneting/SSHing in, this would be /root which is neither sufficiently sized nor, at failsafe time, writeable. Simply change into the /tmp directory before you wget the image (cd /tmp).</p><p>(JFTR, if the router is working you could have skipped setting up a HTTP server and just copied the file over via SCP in normal operation mode. I get it, you&#039;re not that comfortable with OpenWrt and/or its command line yet, which is perfectly understandable. I&#039;m merely pointing out that in all your questions you jump straight to the respective worst case scenario.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 28 Jun 2014, 15:13)</p>

					<p>Hello Everyone,</p><p>Metai your a gem! it&#039;s up and running Luci <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> it was my mistake flashing the wrong image in the first place, I spent a considerable amount of time weeks + some ( read many late nights/early mornings ), reading everything I could and trying it before I bit the bullet and decided to ask for help on this forum. As I know the rules - do your homework and don&#039;t ask stupid or already answered questions.</p><p>There were a few things I missed so thanks for pointing them out, and yep I backed-up the image immediately.&nbsp; Thanks for your help, I am sure I&#039;ll have more questions for the Forum yet but atleast I&#039;m where I wanted to be NOW!&nbsp; If there is anything post flash not well known but a good idea to do please make me aware of it.</p><p>Cheers caps</p>									</div>
