					<p>Hi, I need to secure HTTP service in my LAN (HW IP relay controller). I have TP-Link TL-WR741ND with <strong>4MB</strong> flash only.</p><p>I need to do reverse proxy. All request from WAN to <strong>https://</strong>OPENWRT.IP:443/ must be redirected to <strong>http://</strong>LAN.IP:80/ + I need to add basic password auth for HTTPS.</p><p>How can I do that? On &quot;normal&quot; Linux server I&#039;m using apache, or nginx. But nginx is compiled without ssl support on OpenWrt. And nginx+ssl is probably over 4MB.</p><p>I cannot use stunnel. I need to use normal web browser like firefox as clients.</p>									</div>

					<p>Getting that working on 4mb of flash might be difficult, but not impossible. Tinyproxy might work, but its reverse proxy features are not compiled on OpenWrt. I couldn&#039;t find anything in the buildroot menuconfig to enable that, but it&#039;s described somewhere in the wiki or forums. From my notes, I have this: Add &quot;--enable-reverse&quot; to &quot;CONFIGURE_ARGS&quot; in /feeds/packages/net/tinyproxy/Makefile. I didn&#039;t bother with it though, since Nginx solved all of my reverse proxy needs (I have USB and thus plenty of space on my router).</p><p>How did you fare with the Nginx SSL build? How much bigger was the firmware image than your non-SSL build?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can do a ssh tunnel-- it is not exactly the proxy you want, but it will grant you secure remote access to a device on your LAN which has an unencrypted http interface.&nbsp; This is built into the basic release build.</p><p>Open the router&#039;s ssh port 22 to outside.&nbsp; Then, from somewhere on the Internet, open a terminal and log into the router by ssh using:<br />ssh root@&lt;router DNS or IP&gt; -L 8080:&lt;LAN IP&gt;:80</p><p>Leave this connection open, but you can minimize the terminal window.&nbsp; Go to your web browser to http://localhost:8080.&nbsp; This will be the page on the device on your remote LAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, SSH tunnel will work. But user need to have SSH client (plink.exe for example) and create tunnel before using secured service.<br />SSL proxy do all this automatically.</p>									</div>

					<p>Firstly if you dont have enough space in the eeprom and the device is always connected to internet then you can load the needed packages in RAM (/tmp) on every start.</p><p>Take a look to polarssl library, it&#039;s small and if you dont found a software that it make that you need (reverse tls tunnel), you can code it by yourself easily in C using polarssl.</p>									</div>
