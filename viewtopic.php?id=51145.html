					<p>You are probably mixing system console and serial console.</p><p>For modifying many Openwrt config files, you will need an ssh connection to the system console (command line interface), where you can then use whichever editor you have installed to edit the config files.&nbsp; (Or if there is no password yet, use telnet instead of ssh). <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a></p><p>Serial console is the same, but instead of being connected via network, the connection is made via a serial cable to a header inside the router. That is usually only needed if the Openwrt system does not boot normally, or you want to debug the boot process. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I am an ABSOLUTE beginner.&nbsp; Thanks for your time in writing and your help.</p><p>I can connect to the router and change some of the parameters but the important ones are locked and I want to change them.&nbsp; Principally it is lock to the 5 Ghz band and I would like 2.4Ghz. It can operate at 2.4Ghz.</p><p>I am sorry to be stupid but I don&#039;t understand what ssh, system console or telnet mean.</p><p>From what you have written I think I understand that </p><p>1. if I can connect by LAN cable then I can retrieve the configuration file, work on it and then rewrite it to the router and so a serial cable is not required as the router is working and responding normally.</p><p>2. and, Just to be clear,&nbsp; I need a computer running Linux and the appropriate versions of Openwrt (in this case Backfire 10.03) and a file editor.</p><p>I would be grateful if you would put me right on an inaccuracies. Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>1) No. You connect to the router and edit the file directly on the router. Though you can copy it and then write it back if that pleases you, it may be easier for some people but is unnecessary</p><p>2) No. You can use any device which has a telnet or ssh program available, including Windows, Mac, Android, Linux, iPhone/iOS etc. The file editor is built in to the router.</p>									</div>
