					<p>I installed latest Atheros snapshot on Fonera yday, just default install. I notice the TX signal strength continuously goes up and down between 25% and 80% as measured at the client. Nor the fon firmware neither dd-wrt I had before on this device displays that behaviour... what&#039;s wrong ?</p><p>No there is no other WLAN device simultaneously transmitting on the same channel and I know that can be the cause...</p><p>Anyone else with a Fonera running openwrt kamikaze seeing this ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>intrax</strong> on 4 Mar 2007, 00:47)</p>
