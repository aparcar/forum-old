					<p>Do you have a separate IP address for WAN or is it in the same subnet? If so, you will to activate proxyarp. If not, then maybe your ISP didn&#039;t set up routing for that subnet to your gw. Did you tcpdump on the WAN and see if your ISP&#039;s router send ARP requests for the addresses?</p>									</div>

					<p>The connection is standard PPPoE so&nbsp; get an IP address for the WAN and the IP subnet is routed to the gw.<br />What I am trying to do is replace a Thomson ST546 with a Netgear WNDR3700v2 as I would like to improve my wireless network.</p><p>On the ST546 VLANs were difficult to setup and were reputed to be unreliable so I had avoided them. I had configured it with two subnets on the switch 192.168.100.1/27 with dhcp (LAN) and 74.116.186.177/28 no dhcp (dmz) I then setup &quot;transparent&quot; NAT where WAN IPs = dmz ips. The FW was then configured to allow all outbound to the Internet, input from the Internet to the dmz, and LAN to dmz. This works very well, but there are few short comings. For example servers should not as a rule being accessing the internet, they should be accessed FROM the internet. There is no separation of the two classes of devices attached to the network. </p><p>As the WNDR300v2 + OpenWRT is much more capable I decided to try and use some of the missing features in my setup.<br />First I setup two VLANs <br />1) for the LAN - VLAN1 (named LAN, address 192.168.100.1/27, dhcp on) <br />2) for the servers - VLAN2 (named dmz, Static IPv4 address 74.116.186.177/28, dhcp off)</p><p>next I setup the FW by <br />1) allowing traffic in both direction between the WAN and the dmz.<br />2) allowing traffic from the LAN to the dmz.</p><p>While everybody can get to the internet and I can get from the lan to the dmz, I do not seem to be able to get from the WAN to the dmz.</p><p>Questions:<br />Would I be better off using DNAT to link the WAN to the dmz? If I use DNAT should I use NAT loop-back to allow LAN access to the dmz(servers)?<br />Does/can the FW use connection tracking by default? it would appear that it does but the docs are a little fuzzy on the point, if not how can I turn it on?<br />Does/can the FW use connection tracking on inbound connections? Is it even possible? This would seem to be a requirement if I want to block unsolicited traffic from the dmz to the WAN while allowing inbound traffic.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated<br />John A</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zzz2002</strong> on 15 Mar 2011, 23:20)</p>
