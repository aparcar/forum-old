					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Please be gentle, I am new to OpenWRT (coming from DD-WRT and Tomato) and still finding my way around it. I have been trying to set up adblock for a couple of days and I think I am unsuccessful. I can&#039;t find anything wrong in the logread but ads still pop up in the browsers and elsewhere as before. Am I missing a step somewhere in the set up? Restarting the service doesn&#039;t give any feedback so I have no idea if it is running or not. I read the whole thread and tried all the commands suggested and everything points to a working set up but I can&#039;t see the results.</p><p>Debug enabled. Bunch of lists enabled.

					<p>Thanks nd for the suggestions. I will add the new source.</p><p>My version of OpeWRT is customised arokh&#039;s build. The initial version of adblock was version 1.xx and it was failing due to wget not being able to download ssl sources. So, I updated wget, updated adblock and now I can see things get downloaded.</p><p>At the same time, seems like there were major differences between the versions and some of the old files were not cleaned up. So now I have conf files in /etc/adblock folder, but also the config file /etc/config/adblock so I have no idea which config file the script is using. I will have to investigate the script a little deeper.</p><p>But I think there was some progress, last night I rebooted the router while making some other changes, and noticed that some of the ads are blocked, but only on the mobile phone. Not all wireless works, as ads are still being served on the laptop. Weird. I am hoping that the new source might help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for trying to help guys. I just couldn&#039;t figure out what was happening so I made the decision and went back to DD-WRT. It took me all of 10-15 seconds to set this up and start blocking ads on every device on the network. Life is great again. I will be missing some of the features of OpenWRT, but all the time spent on set up was starting to affect my family and my sanity :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>The adblock package has been added after the 15.05.1 release, so it is not available as a built .ipk for CC15.05.1. If you want it, you might install the trunk package of adblock to CC, as the package is only scripts, no binaries. </p><p>BTW, Openwrt development pretty much stopped in April/May 2016 when practically all active core developers left for LEDE - so I didn&#039;t run any CC specific tests anymore ... best is to head over to LEDE, stable release 17.01 or current LEDE snapshots.
