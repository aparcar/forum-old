					<p>Hi guys,<br />Today I performed receive sensitivity tests for wrt54gl with openwrt 8.09.1 (2.4) and the svn trunk (2.6).<br />My test was very simple:</p><p>2 WRT54GL APs in 2 different, distant rooms (one of which made out of concrete with no windows) connected with a long cable (no antennas connected)<br />1 unit with 8.09.1-2.4 running in AP mode and sending the default 10 beacons per second and 1 unit with the svn trunk (and later with 8.09.1-2.4) running in monitor mode<br />My cable had 3 spots in which I used attenuators. One - very close to the antenna of the AP (-40dBm), one in the center (another -40dBm) and a variable attenuator near the receiving unit. The cable itself lost 2-3dB.</p><p>I verified the signal strength at the receiving end using a really expensive spectrum analyzer I borrowed from a friend.</p><p>My test was simple - how many beacons can I see at which signal strength (tested with a simple tcpdump test)<br />Since the AP is sending out the signal at 20dBm, I managed to get all beacons at -60dBm (20-40-40), then I started reducing the signal further, the unit stopped receiving beacons completely as soon as I reached -77dBm and at -75dBm I got about 10% of the beacons (horrible as well...)<br />According to Linksys WRT54GL should have a receive sensitivity of -99dBm @ 1mbit, according to my tests - I get no signal at -77dBm, that&#039;s 23dB difference...!<br />I performed the same test with the vanilla 8.09.1-2.4 with similar results.</p><p>My questions are:<br />1. Is it a known issue?<br />2. Did I do something wrong in my test?<br />3. If wrt54GL is not that good when it comes to sensitivity - which AP has the best receive sensitivity and is supported by openwrt?? (I don&#039;t care for the transmission power, I am using an amp anyway).</p><p>I would really appreciate any help, I am pretty stuck here and I never believed that receive sensitivity will be my problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alfred_m</strong> on 23 Aug 2009, 10:17)</p>

					<p>one aspect undocumented in your description of the test is the modulation bit rate.<br />Are both sides allowed to renegotiate the bit rate (wireless config settings) when the signal gets weaker.<br />Install the wl package and check ´ wl rate´ on either side during the test.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks,<br />I did not negotiate any bit rate as there was no actual connection, I simply used the receiving AP in monitor mode and checked how many beacons I am at which attenuation level.</p>									</div>
