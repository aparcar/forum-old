					<p>I have an nfs share on another Linux computer (running Debian Sarge) and listed in /etc/exports.&nbsp; I can mount it on another computer but I can&#039;t mount it on my OpenWRT system.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a syntax difference in the BusyBox commands or what the issue is because the error message is so cryptic.&nbsp; I searched the OpenWRT files system and didn&#039;t find any NFS log files.&nbsp; I have kmod_nfs installed, but didn&#039;t see any other nfs packages to install on OpenWRT.&nbsp; I used just &quot;mount.&quot;&nbsp; This is the line in /etc/exports on the NFS server:</p><p>/data/Data/Audio/flac 172.16.7.0/255.255.255.0(ro,sync)</p><p>This is the line in /etc/fstab on the OpenWRT system:</p><p>172.16.7.2:/data/Data/Audio/flac/ /usr/share/mpd/music nfs</p><p>I had more options included, but I pared them down because I thought they might cause errors.&nbsp; This is the error message I get:</p><p>mount: mounting 172.16.7.2:/data/Data/Audio/flac/ on /usr/share/mpd/music failed</p><p>When I had not entered the proper date in /etc/exports on the server I did get a message that the server didn&#039;t authorize the share, so I think they&#039;re communicating.&nbsp; The directory /usr/share/mpd/music does exist on the OpenWRT system.</p><p>Am I doing something wrong?&nbsp; Is there a way to get more info (I tried mount with -v for verbose but it gave me nothing worse).&nbsp; I also tried using mount and specifying the info, like this:</p><p>mount -t nfs -o ro 172.16.7.2:/data/Data/Audio/flace /usr/share/mpd/music</p><p>And at first, got an error message for the option.&nbsp; I removed the &quot;-ro o&quot; part and got the same error as I did all the other times.&nbsp; I also tried without the &quot;ro&quot; in /etc/exports and tried removing all options in the same file, but it wouldn&#039;t work that way (nfs needs sync or rsync).</p><p>Thanks for any help on this!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HalNineThousand</strong> on 16 Aug 2007, 07:35)</p>

					<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I took the easy way and just rebooted.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get an error, but it just locks up when I enter the mount command now.&nbsp; It happens if I just type mount or if I give all the parameters to the mount command.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah!&nbsp; I tried -o nolock on earlier attempts and forgot to include it once I rebooted, as I said above.&nbsp; That makes all the difference!</p><p>I had Googled for nfs and the key words in the error message, both on this site only and world wide and did not get that page in the links.&nbsp; Thanks for the link page!</p>									</div>
