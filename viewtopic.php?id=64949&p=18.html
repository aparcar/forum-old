					<p>Hi david, I installed your 4.4.24 LEDE build to my WRT1200ACSv2 today (awesome!) and have been trying to start up a strongSwan client on it.

					<p>Thanks @davidc502 for all the work - have been running your build for a month with no issues whatsoever!</p><p>The only drawback is the lack of packages. If the compilation time is not an issue I would recommend selecting all lede packages and running </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make</code></pre></div><p> with IGNORE_ERRORS set to 1. This will skip failed builds of some packages (~10-15) but will continue with all the other selected packages.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>IGNORE_ERRORS=1 make -j8 2&gt;&amp;1| tee pkg_errors.log</code></pre></div><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>
