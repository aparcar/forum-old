					<p>I have a Buffalo WZR-HP-G450H router that I would like to setup for VPN access however, I do not see anywhere on the router to configure VPN. The router is setup with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09. It is for a small company. Could you please let me know how to get this setup. I am not sure how to go about doing this. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>									</div>
