					<p>Hi there,</p><p>Just purchased Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H.</p><p>I am considering my options and would like to know what will benefit me the most.</p><p>DD-WRT or OpenWrt.</p><p>1) What I am after is firstly to know how to flash back to stock<br />2) Which ever one will have the same capabilities as the stock firmware + heaps of extras<br />3) One that will run all encapsulations PPPoE and PPPoA (PPPoA as this is what we use in NZ)<br />4) One that will have the built in offline torrenting function like the original firmware<br />5) One where I can actually control the QOS on my network (limit speeds/priority on devices).</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help and advice look forward to seeing some replies.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>msp_411</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately soon I will be abroad, so in this moment I can&#039;t build any image.<br />Meanwhile I suggest you to try one of the precompiled image that you can find in the download section of openwrt.org (if I don&#039;t mistake in the wiki pages is described how to choose the right image), and in install the packages that you need via opkg.</p><p>Regarding the dw/up speeds, from my point of view, there&#039;s not a huge difference, however it isn&#039;t very easy to make a comparison between the different builds, since the dw/up speeds depends on the quality of the line (in fact I must say that since my line isn&#039;t very good, so I&#039;m not in conditions to make a accurate comparison).<br />The only thing that I can say is that with latest build of DD-WRT aren&#039;t very light, in fact I measured a not so low CPU/RAM utilisation even when I was running non demanding tasks...</p>									</div>
