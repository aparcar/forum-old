					<p>First, congrats to the OpenWrt Team on the first public release of Kamikaze 7.06. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>One thing is obvious - lack of staple packages I&#039;ve become accustomed to in Whiterussian.&nbsp; The first examples were ntpclient and OpenVPN.&nbsp; NO PROBLEMS getting them loaded - I just pointed to the Whiterussian package and hacked a startup.&nbsp; If I missed something, please let me know.</p><p>These packages are surely not in the Broadcom-on-2.6-kernel category - this stuff is known to be work-in-progress.</p><p>Is this oversight?&nbsp; Are more packages coming?&nbsp; Should we expect less of ready-to-go Kamikaze packages (compared to Whiterussian)?</p><p>TIA</p><p>Bill</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 4 Jun 2007, 04:53)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve been using kamikazee and the buildroot-ng for a long long time now.&nbsp; Theres a lot of packages in whiterussian that were packaged a long long time ago and subsequently abandoned, and will likely never make it into Kamikazee until someone decides to manually port the package themself.&nbsp; For it to be a working package with kamikazee, it must be a package which can build under kamikazee.&nbsp; As of now, there are no backports of old whiterussian binaries to run under kamikazee, nor do I see a demand for making such a hackish repository.</p><p>Kamikazee&#039;s new buildroot-ng build system is very powerful and much easier than the old whiterussian, but there&#039;s not a good automated way for the team to import all the old whiterussian buildfiles unfortuantely, simply too much has changed.&nbsp; The end of the line is, if you need it (re-)packaged, try packaging itself, and people here will be as best of assistance as they can to help you make new packages.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Rektide</strong> on 4 Jun 2007, 05:57)</p>

					<p>Official binary packages for optional software will come in time; 7.06 is the first version of Kamikaze, wait for the dust to settle before switching if you desire official packages.&nbsp; As mentioned above, you can build your own if you are on Linux, BSD, or most other *nix operating systems.&nbsp; I think the x-wrt team also has a repository of binary packages, but keep in mind that while these packages (typically) use the official makefiles, they are not official binary packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>Many of us do build our own images to save space.&nbsp; Squashfs compression is significantly better than JFFS2 compression.&nbsp; A few of us also do it to produce turnkey images of our own (image has most of our configs included in the squashfs partition.)&nbsp; Some of us also produce our own svn builds because we are using devices that are not fully supported yet, or are helping add support or bug test new functionality.&nbsp; Others build their own packages because they add custom patches; there are all kinds of reasons.</p><p>As I said, X-Wrt does have binary packages if you want something right now, but keep in mind that they are not official OpenWrt packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>Contrary to what is written above. Packages are something we want to supply public trees for. However as Kamikaze is a fast moving target and packages are quite frankly a lot of work, they aren&#039;t going to be released overnight. A process of fixing them up ready for release, but if you can&#039;t wait then you can compile them using the SDK.<br />TTFN</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>
