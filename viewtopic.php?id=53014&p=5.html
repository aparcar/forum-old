One of the many great things about OpenWRT is that the config files are pretty much hardware independent. The same AP config setup on most other plattforms will work on a RAMIPS platform.

					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>So much progress has been made by the OpenWRT team I decided it was time to provide some new &quot;factory&quot; upgrade images on my Github repository <a href="https://github.com/wingspinner/HooToo-Tripmate-HT-TM02-OpenWRT">https://github.com/wingspinner/HooToo-T … 02-OpenWRT</a>. If you are planning to convert a new TM02 to OpenWRT I suggest you use the newer images rather than the old one (which is still there). Please read the readme files there for more info. Instructions in the first post of this thread have been updated. </p><p>Also, I&#039;ve generated and stored the entire packages repository for r44945 on the github site so that it will continue to be available as the trunk moves to future revisions. Best way to use that is to clone it to your local system and reset your repository url&#039;s to point to it.</p><p>Lastly, for advanced users who have the capability to build your own images, I&#039;ve added a tool to generate HooToo compatible &quot;factory&quot; images. It requires a sysupgrade image and uboot image as input. Again, read the readme on github for usage info. At some point I&#039;d like to integrate this into the OpenWRT build tool. If someone wants to take my work and convert it from a shell script to a c program compatible with the OpenWRT builder I wouldn&#039;t mind at all! I&#039;ve published it under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.</p><p>One more thing... I just received an HT-TM04. It&#039;s a great little box! It&#039;s pretty similar to the TM02 (as all RT5350 based devices are) and I&#039;ll have some &quot;factory&quot; images for it soon. Just need to verify GPIO&#039;s and such.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Ron Curry<br />wingspinner</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wingspinner</strong> on 24 Mar 2015, 19:15)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve verified that the TM02 images work just fine on the TM04 with no modifications. LED and switches are mapped identically. I used the MMC and SD kernel modules and the SD card works fine as well. As far as I can tell it&#039;s fully compatible with the TM02 and everything works fine. Have at it!</p><p>Cheers,<br />Ron Curry<br />Wingspinner</p>									</div>

If you are planning to convert a new TM02 to OpenWRT I suggest you use the newer images rather than the old one (which is still there). Please read the readme files there for more info.

OpenWRT was designed for that and there is no need to build a new image every time you need to add a package.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi everyone. I need some help with my TM02. I am pretty sure I accidentally disabled all interfaces to enable on boot and now naturally I cannot access the device at all.

					<p>Hi, I managed to be locked-out in a similar manner, but was able to &quot;reset&quot; it by getting into the serial console and enter the <strong>firstboot</strong> command, then <strong>reboot</strong></p><p>That&#039;s really the easiest way, other than reprogramming the flash chip, manually.</p><p>If you already tried TFTP you most likely already know how to access it&#039;s serial console.<br />If not...<br />You&#039;ll need to attach a USB to TTL Serial cable to the built-in serial console connector pins on the board to do it.</p><p><strong>wingspinner</strong> explains where to get, and how to connect this cable to it, earlier in this thread.</p><p>I used the new Prolific chip cable, and driver, <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/954">http://www.adafruit.com/products/954</a><br />but there&#039;s another cable, that&#039;s a bit more expensive. (FTDI cable) sold at adafruit or other places too.</p><p>Check it out at this link.<br /><a href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_Accessories#Serial_Debug_Cables.">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBon … ug_Cables.</a></p><p>You&#039;ll also need <strong>Putty</strong> if you&#039;re using it with a Windows PC, to access the cable after installing the cables driver.</p><p>If you use Linux, the driver is built-in, but I don&#039;t know much about using Linux and if Putty is needed too, or if that or another method is also built-in to that OS, to access the USB to TTL serial cable.</p><p>There&#039;s also eBay, and China sellers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br /><a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=Useful%20Portable%20PL2303TA%20to%20RS232%20USB%20Converter%20GPS%20Module%20Serial%20Adapter%20Cable&amp;_itemId=261654562217">http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=U … 1654562217</a></p><p>I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if adafruit gets them form china, and resells them at a higher cost in America. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>The cable does look similar to the adafruit product.</p><p>I opened my adafruit cable, blue plastic end, and saw it actually has many more connection options than just the ones brought-out onto the cable connector wires.<br />So, for me, I was happier I got that one.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>aj1x wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hi everyone.
