					<p>It is not clear what you are insinuating John, my post is not a commentary but very much a question to a problem I have yet to solve... For some reason my traffic is not getting forwarded on to the computers on the other side of the tunnel. I laid out my current setup in hopes that someone with a better understanding of IPSec and Networking than myself may see what I have misconfigured or any steps I have missed. I have tried solving this on my own and continue to do so but I have yet to find anything online that fixes the problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>									</div>

					<p>Not that this will be terribly useful for anyone that has this problem and finds this post, but I did manage to get this working. I wish I could detail how I did it but I do not know. All that is different between my current setup and the setup I detailed in the OP is that I am using a different openWRT image that I built from source and customized via menuconfig. I removed a lot of extra packages including luCI and I replaced dropbear with openssh. One difference I noticed is on my original setup (the one that did not work) under ifconfig I did not have an ipsec0 interface. Whereas on my working setup I have an ipsec0 interface even before I establish the connection. </p><p>It is probably worth noting that the image I was working with that was not working, I had also built from source and had added strongswan in manually.</p>									</div>
