					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>I have a router based on the Qualcomm Atheros AR9331. I have managed to build an image and run it on my router. Since then I&#039;ve been trying to set up an RPCD backend server to use through UBUS. I have read through a few tutorials:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/rpcd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/rpcd</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.onion.io/Tutorials/OpenWRT%20Tutorials/UBUS_Tutorial/Part3_RPCD">https://wiki.onion.io/Tutorials/OpenWRT … Part3_RPCD</a></p><p>I have used the Onion Omega as a guide, however on their software (available here: <a href="https://downloads.onion.io/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-onion-omega-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.onion.io/openwrt-ar71 … actory.bin</a>) the file /usr/libexec/rpcd exists, whenever I make my build, the folder is not there.</p><p>I have also looked through this forum post:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58495">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58495</a></p><p>I created the directory, added my bash file and then added the executable permission, then I restart the rpcd daemon but I have had no luck getting ubus to recognize my new commands. Is there something I&#039;m missing? I would like to have rpcd available through ubus from first boot.</p><p>Below is my configdiff file.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx=y
