					<p>I would like to be able to read/write the whole firmware image at the router flash chip<br />directly - using SOIC-8 test clip with CH341A USB programmer and flashrom software<br />- all without desoldering a flash chip <em>( in-system programming <a href="https://www.flashrom.org/ISP">https://www.flashrom.org/ISP</a> )</em></p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> when I connect a SOIC-8 test clip to the flash chip at router&#039;s board<br />there is one LED which is always ON and seven LEDs which are blinking:<br />per each 1 second of time they are 0.3 seconds OFF and 0.7 seconds ON</p><p>Then, I am able to detect the router&#039;s flash chip only at 30% of cases and<br />when its detected and starts reading it - per each 0x1E000 of data <em>(30*0x1000)</em><br />there is about 30% correct data <em>(9*0x1000)</em> then 70% of zeros <em>(21*0x1000)</em><br /><em><strong>^^^</strong> 30% / 70% , seems to correlate with LEDs blinking pattern !</em></p><p>Maybe while LEDs are ON they are eating extra power which was intended for the flash chip,<br />so I&#039;m going to short circuit these 7 LEDs with &quot;red&quot; temporary bridges - like at the picture below</p><p><strong>Please tell:</strong> is it a good idea to shorten the LEDs or it could break something?<br /><em>And what circuit elements are making those LEDs to blink at this pattern?</em></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RPpcFhY.jpg" alt="https://i.imgur.com/RPpcFhY.jpg" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mward15</strong> on 28 Jan 2018, 00:10)</p>

					<p>The LED is a symptom, not the cause.

I found the SOC&#039;s datasheet <em>(QCA9531/QCA9533 picture below contains all the available info about RESET_L pin)</em> -&nbsp; and sadly RESET_L is &quot;hidden at the 2nd row&quot;, I can&#039;t touch it with multimeter and so can&#039;t check if any of the router&#039;s test points are connected to RESET_L or its simply &quot;floating&quot;</p><p>Still trying to avoid the soldering... Alternative way of restoring the U-Boot could have been the JTAG flashing, but for this particular router - TP-LINK WR841ND v9 - there is no known JTAG pinout for its&#039; 12 hole header! Can&#039;t find any leaked datasheets for this board either. One of these holes <em>(bottom right corner)</em> is surely VCC but I don&#039;t know how to discover the rest of JTAG pinout.

How the people are determining JTAG pinout for the first time? So far I&#039;ve found JTAG Finder and Jtagulator hardware adapters, but they aren&#039;t open source and cost 4x more than this router</p>									</div>
