					<p>Hello everyone.</p><p>I have an WR941ND v3.5 with OpenWrt CC + Breed custom Uboot from Hackpascal<br />So.. I try to access my router via Serial pin with USB to TTL PL2303</p><p>&gt; In the wiki&#039;s page noted that I need to short 2 R356 pins like in that picture.<br />&gt; First of all, I try to connect directly without short the R356 pins. I have nothing in my serial console/terminal.<br />&gt; Then, I short the pins already and try to connect again. But I still have nothing in my serial console.<br />&gt; My PL2303 USB to TTL is normal and nothing wrong with it, just I cant get my serial access in WR941ND v3.</p><p>What should I do to get the serial console access?</p><p>Thank you so much guys!</p>									</div>
