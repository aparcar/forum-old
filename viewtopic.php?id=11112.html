					<p>I&#039;ve just installed White Russian with X-Wrt extensions 0.9.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying out OpenWrt because the QOS in the stock Linksys firmware is terrible.</p><p>Anyway, I thought this would be a quick tweak, I want to give priority to my VOIP devices based on their MAC addresses.&nbsp; However, to my surprise, there&#039;s no place in the QOS setup page to set priority via MAC address.&nbsp; Is there something I&#039;m missing here?&nbsp; Even the stock Linksys GUI has MAC based QOS configuration.</p><p>I also clicked on the &quot;Manual Edit the Config&quot; button which brings up the file /etc/config/qos for editing.&nbsp; I tried reading the file for some possible clues to configure it, but there&#039;s no entry that seems to key on MAC address.&nbsp; Is this the kind of thing that can be cofigured via this file?</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a quick tweak and would rather not have to get into all that &quot;qos-scripts&quot; writing, which I don&#039;t have any clue about...</p><p>TIA.</p>									</div>
