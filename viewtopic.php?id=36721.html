					<p>Hi, we have been testing what is the absolute maximum speed over wifi when using openwrt, for out test we used this hardware:</p><p>- 2 x Ubiquity Router station<br />- 2 x Wistron CM9 802.11a/b/g mini pci cards<br />- 2 x 3dBi omni antennas</p><p>- openwrt version - backfire 10.03.1<br />- wifi driver - madwifi<br />- distance - 2 meters (same room)<br />- encryption - psk2</p><p>For benchmarking we installed iperf package and used default settings (tcp packets in one direction).</p><p>First we tested &quot;plain&quot; 802.11a mode (hwmode 11a) on channel 40 and we got 30-35Mbit speeds.</p><p>Then we switched to 801.11a turbo (hwmode 11ast) and got 55-60 Mbit speeds.</p><p>Is this the maximum speed possible? Are there any other tweaks we can do to get faster speeds?</p><p>Did you get faster speeds? How? Which gear did you use? We didn&#039;t make results artificially better by using udp packags, my guess by using udp packages we could get near 100 Mbit speeds.</p><p>Are there any openwrt tutorials for tweaking and benchmarking maximum speed?</p><p>Cheers from Croatia,<br />Valent.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>valentt</strong> on 10 May 2012, 00:22)</p>

					<p>the routerstation has quite a fast cpu, but maybe you want to try running iperf on clients connected to the lan ports of the two routerstations. In the past I made some test and the bridge-, or even routingperformance was always faster than the speed that I got when running iperf on the router itself. So maybe you want to try this out, because I guess that&#039;s what really matters, with which speed clients can connect to each other. <br />I&#039;m not sure if this applies to the routerstation, too, but you should give it a try. </p><p>And if you want higher speeds get an 11na-card even with only one spatial stream you will probably get higher rates. (150Mbit brutto with 802.11na vs. 108Mbit brutto with 802.11a turbo)</p><p>and btw 60MBit (netto) are quite good rates for 11a turbo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 10 May 2012, 09:55)</p>
