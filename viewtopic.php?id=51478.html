					<p>I was running openwrt for a couple of months on my mynet 750n. Decided to mess around with some wifi settings and wifi stopped working. I had no idea how to fix it, so I reset settings to default. Now I got luci and everything else running, but wifi tab is empty. Is it worth trying to flash openwrt from usb again? Any help appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>How did you &quot;reset to default&quot;? It appears you deleted your wireless settings. Just login to the console and issue &quot;firstboot&quot;, that should reset the router properly.</p><p>Also, generally you don&#039;t need to reflash to reset the router. But keep in mind that you lose all installed packages, and you&#039;ll probably not be able to install some packages again because the trunk build id has changed. Try to reset first, if you run into these problems, sysupgrade.</p>									</div>
