					<p>i see its been added to the Source almost 4 months ago but im not that keen on ho wto Compile a read-to-flash image (and teh Pi2 SD Image while it seems to Suport my TendaW311M USB Device when i try it cant put the Adapter into AP Mode Despite the adapter Supports AP Mode</p><p>i have tried <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59768">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59768</a> but the Pi3 goes &quot;Brain Dead&quot; aftre 10 mins (it disappears from my Comcast Modem (i dont care about teh Issue of Router on Router, the 3 Wireless devices connecting in this manner dont need SMBSharing etc. (a 3DS in DSMode, a DSI in DS Mode and PSP) i primarily only intend to use the Pi3 as a &quot;Walled off&quot; Router of sorts from teh rest of my network only port forward for games that need to . (dont feel like getting an proper router that supports multiple SSIDs to do this as i&#039;m Kinda Broke.)</p><p>Any idea why its going Mute like this as it were to teh network or is that the RaspberyPi3 Support not really complete yet? or is it possible to make it DHCP Forward servicing only as a Secondary Wireless AP? (Get and lease IPs From the Modem itself that the Pi is connected to?)</p>									</div>
