					<p>Ok, I&#039;ve been poking around this for a while but I cant figure out a way to get it to work.<br />Here&#039;s the situation:<br />My college apartment has multiple wired connections. Upstairs, I have a wrt54gl running openwrt with a static wan ip address connecting to our schools internet connections. I use it to host a couple servers and miscellaneous things. Downstairs, we have another network that we use mainly for gaming, general internet access, etc that has a dynamic wan address also connecting to the schools network, that one has a wrt54g v6 so no 3rd party firmware. What I&#039;d like to do is wirelessly connect the two networks, while still allowing them to have their own wan connections. More or less if i just ran a cable from one of the lan ports on the downstairs router to one of the lan ports on the upstairs router. However I haven&#039;t found a way to do this. WDS doesn&#039;t seem to me like it&#039;d help since it just rebroadcasts the signal from one router out to a wider area, which, I don&#039;t think, is what I want.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
