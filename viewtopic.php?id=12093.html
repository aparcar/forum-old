					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I know White Russian is a dead branch but I&#039;m new to Linux and OpenWRT and am wondering if I&#039;m doing something wrong, or if this is a known limitation with the broadcom driver.&nbsp; I got my WRT54GL last night and have been reading and tinkering non-stop.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m hoping some people still read this forum and feel like helping out. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I have my WRT65GL running in Client (Managed) mode and running the kismet_server and kismet_client on it.&nbsp; I have kismet logging to a share on an XP laptop that&#039;s wired to the Linksys.</p><p>What I noticed when looking through the dump file with WireShark is that there are no data packets in the wireless captures.&nbsp; It&#039;s all Layer 2 connection information (Beacon Frames, Probe Requests, Acknowledgements).&nbsp; </p><p>I got my wife to connect to a wireless router and she did some IM&#039;ing, web browsing, watched some streaming content and nothing was showing up in the .dump file.</p><p>I also tried playing with the kismet.conf file, reading all the docs I could find on kismet and OpenWRT, and I&#039;m feeling stuck.&nbsp; </p><p>I found someone else asking the same question at the kismet forums but their answer didn&#039;t help me enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;They said kismet will log what the driver gives it.&nbsp; Well, that leads me to believe it might be a driver issue.&nbsp; Since the driver came with the White Russian 0.9 deliverable, I&#039;m assuming everyone has this problem.</p><p>Have any of you guys run into this?&nbsp; Did you find a way around it?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to be able to capture data packets over wireless as well as the connection packets.</p><p>Thanks in Advance!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>P.S. I&#039;m downloading a VM so I can learn how to compile linux binaries if required, but I&#039;m very new to Linux (the closest experience I have was using DOS on a 386/486 LOL) so please don&#039;t be too mean.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like switching from &quot;source=wrt54g,eth1,wireless&quot; to &quot;source=wrt54g,eth1:prism0,wireless&quot; has added some data packets.&nbsp; I&#039;m still not seeing data on an unprotected wireless connection (that I expected to see) but now I&#039;m seeing data showing up for a secured wireless AP.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s real data or if it&#039;s due to me adding the noiselog=true setting in the kismet.conf file.&nbsp; It&#039;s encryped, so I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s garbage or real data.</p>									</div>

					<p>Strange thing...&nbsp; As stated in my previous message, I&#039;m seeing some data packets now.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m not seeing data packets for a wide open unprotected wireless connection.&nbsp; Kismet even alerts that my wifes computer is suspicious because she&#039;s probing networks but never participating:</p><p> ALERT: Suspicious client [insert MAC address here] - probing networks but never participating. </p><p>But she&#039;s watching movies over the internet, web browsing, and playing online video games.&nbsp; I should be able to see http traffic, etc. but it&#039;s not showing up.</p><p>This leads me to believe the driver isn&#039;t passing all the information down to kismet.&nbsp; Anyone else seeing this or have ideas on what the next step should be for troubleshooting this?</p>									</div>
