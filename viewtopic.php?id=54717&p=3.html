					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I bought a WT3020 with 8MB on Alibaba. I&#039;ve flashed it with factory image from here <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/mt7620/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … ps/mt7620/</a> . Now I try to access the router somehow.</p><p>1) WAN to my home router = the WT3020 get an IP. The webinterface is not accessible over this IP. SSH gives a login to me but it seems that no root password is set.</p><p>2) I tried to connect over telnet in failsave mode. I get the failsave enabled (LED flashes fast) but I get no ping on WAN or LAN connector under 192.168.1.1 (PC is set to 192.168.1.2) Also Telnet times out on both connectors</p><p>3) I have soldered RX/TX/GND to a mobile phone datacable. I use putty under windows to make a serial connection. I get a lot of response on booting the wt3020 but all garbage characters. I tried all baudrates from 9600 up to 115200 with 8/1/none/none. The garbage changes with the different baudrates but stays garbage. Is there a special setting needed in Putty? I have checked the soldering and GND (taken from LAN connector solderpoint) - all fine</p><p>Has somebody a hint for me?</p><p>Example from serial output.</p><p>▒▒▒&quot;▒▒▒222▒▒ ▒2&amp;▒▒&quot;02▒▒▒▒▒RT▒)/k▒j▒▒▒Ƚb▒z▒▒▒&lt;f▒▒▒&lt;f!!!!!!9+▒▒<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;▒)▒)▒J▒▒n^▒▒))▒{▒▒*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O▒=▒▒!!!!!!!k▒▒r▒I▒B!n▒▒?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>turbotommi</strong> on 21 Jun 2015, 20:50)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s an older datacable with 2303 Profilic. USB\VID_067B&amp;PID_2303&amp;REV_0300 GND is soldered to one of the LAN connector shield (where it&#039;s soldered to the board, like in in the pictures on beginning of this thread) I cannot open the USB plug without destroying it, to check the exact chip.

					<p>I have a problem: I tried to build an image with imagebuilder because I want to include some Freifunk packages. The image is booting but network interfaces goes up/down in an endless chain. WLAN EEPROM get also not loaded. Long story short - I have to flash over TFTP. This is my first time doing it. The TFTP Server runs fine and I Im connected also serial. I get the following menu</p><p>Please choose the operation: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1: Load system code to SDRAM via TFTP. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3: Boot system code via Flash (default).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4: Entr boot command line interface.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;9: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via TFTP. </p><p>I have made a dry test using option 1 with the sysupgrade.bin file. The System starts up fine, the bootlog looks excellent. Can I flash the sysupgrade.bin now on a restart with option 2? What is the different to factory.bin. I found a few tutorials for other hardware which use the factory.bin on this bootloader.</p><p>I use the files from here <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/mt7620/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … ps/mt7620/</a></p>									</div>
