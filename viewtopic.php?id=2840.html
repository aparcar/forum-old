					<p>Sad but true:</p><p>I had a WR850G running perfectly with openwrt rc3 (openwrt-motorola-squashfs.bin flashed onto a virgin wr850g straight out of the box).&nbsp; &nbsp; I named him thomas; sorry if anyone is confused when I refer to him by name, but our relationship is strong despite only knowing each other for a short time.&nbsp; I added the nas binary and it was working perfectly with wpa-psk.&nbsp; I added a cell phone data cable usb serial port.&nbsp; The only issue was the wireless LED which never did anything.&nbsp; Life was pretty good, but now it&#039;s gone... all gone *sob.*</p><p>I suppose I should have left well enough alone, but I thought I&#039;d try overclocking to see if I could squeeze out a little more performance since I was running encryption.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have any benchmarks for comparison, but it seemed like fun and I was on a roll.&nbsp; boot_wait is set (and remains so through power cycles although I have heard of thomas&#039; wrt850g siblings not retaining this setting).&nbsp; It all started innocently enough:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># nvram set clkfreq=264
# nvram commit
# reboot</code></pre></div><p>With the serial connection, I watched the entire process and it was all fine.&nbsp; The processor reported 264MHz.&nbsp; However, after about 1 minute thomas abended, spewed a register dump to the console and rebooted himself.&nbsp; No big deal, it&#039;ll be alright buddy.&nbsp; He came back up just the same, but again rebooted after a minute; better try something else.&nbsp; According to the wiki overclocking some routers (200 to 216) helps stability, so I&#039;ll try to apply that by overclocking my overclocking:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># nvram set clkfreq=300
# nvram commit
# reboot</code></pre></div><p>Looking good: processor running at 300MHz, but this time we don&#039;t even get to busybox before self-booting, not even close.&nbsp; Dang, but not a problem because I can crtl^c through the serial console when thomas waits for me to flash a new firmware if I&#039;d like.&nbsp; This jumps into the CFE where I can still set nvram variables:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CFE&gt; nvram set clkfreq=200
CFE&gt; nvram commit
CFE&gt; reboot</code></pre></div><p>Right as rain and stable for over 15 minutes until I decide that the overclocking experiment must continue.&nbsp; I tried using the SBClock as well:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># nvram set clkfreq=264,132
# nvram commit
# reboot</code></pre></div><p>Same problem, reboot after 1 minute.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m tired of waiting for busy box, so I ctrl^c into CFE and figure I can just set what I want there to seee what happens since thus far I&#039;ve never had any problems getting into the serial console.&nbsp; This is where my story develops a point because I tried:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CFE&gt; nvram set clkfreq=288
CFE&gt; nvram commit
CFE&gt; reboot</code></pre></div><p>I didn&#039;t mention this before, but the reboot command in CFE never did seem to work.&nbsp; The nvram settings were committed, but reboot would just sit there until I power cycled or reset via the button.&nbsp; Apparently, 288 was not a good setting to attempt because now I got nuthin&#039; but apparently useless LEDs.</p><p>No serial console output.&nbsp; I use WindowsXP hyperterminal, and it was fine up until now.</p><p>When thomas fires up, the LEDs (except wireless which I don&#039;t think has ever done anything) light orange for about 1/2 second, then all green.&nbsp; If I connect an ethernet cable to my laptop, that light (LAN 1-4 or WAN) is orange, and blinks irregularly with LAN activity.&nbsp; These symptoms have been described in another post which on second thought I should have added to instead of starting a new one, sorry.&nbsp; If I hit reset, the LEDs (except wireless...) behave basiacally as I would expect.&nbsp; Power: solid green, LAN and WAN green when connected while occasionally blinking with activity.</p><p>I can&#039;t ping or tftp.&nbsp; I tried 192.168.10.1 since this seems to be hard-wired into thomas&#039; genetic code.&nbsp; I tried 192.168.1.1 since OpenWrt and most firmwares use this defautl.&nbsp; I tried 192.168.192.169 (subnet 255.255.255.248) since this was lan_ipaddr before the fall. nothing, zip, zero, nada.</p><p>I am not a linux or harware guru, but I don&#039;t think it is even getting to the point where I could flash the firmware through tftp.&nbsp; From my experience with the serial console I am pretty sure I&#039;d know when the tftp window opened with the boot loader messages.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s even trying to wait.</p><p>JTAG time.&nbsp; But, I don&#039;t have the parts lying around, so I&#039;ll have to get out shopping.&nbsp; Patience is not one of my strong suits, so I start the short pins method, but it has not gotten anywhere yet.</p><p>Still JTAG time, so that&#039;s what I will attempt when I can get parts.&nbsp; does the CFE nvram do the same thing as the &quot;normal&quot; nvram, or does it overwrite the CFE defaults?&nbsp; Is that even possible?&nbsp; I thought the first 256k of flash was basically untouchable without modifying the kernel.&nbsp; Have I trashed the bootloader?&nbsp; I think (hope) I can repair that if so.</p><p>Anyway, this last bit is pretty much beyond my knowledge, so I&#039;m just guessing.&nbsp; However I think I will need (at the least) a good cfe.bin from a wr850gv2 intel flash.&nbsp; If I need to fix the bootloader can I do that through jtag or not?</p><p>I think this is a brick--my first time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I wish I had a brick that would show me the openwrt banner--that I could fix; it&#039;s not a brick; it&#039;s just misconfigured.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>p.s. I was thinking I&#039;d rather buy a jtag cable than build one, but I can&#039;t seem to find where to do so.&nbsp; ebay seemed promising, but I&#039;d like some better idea of what I was getting.&nbsp; I know the board has no pin block and I&#039;ll have to solder anyway, but I think adding a pin block and keeping the cable separate is within my capability.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you can replace the bootloader with jtag, IF you can find the correct bootloader for it, I myself am having a world of trouble trying to find a wrt54g v3.1 CFE for mine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />&nbsp; &nbsp; Also note, the jtag cable is REALLY easy to make, if you&#039;ve added a serial console and such you should have no problems making the jtag cable (I just used the really simple unbuffered xilinx dlc5 based cable mentioned in the hairydairymaid debrick utility .zip in the downloads section, works a charm)</p>									</div>
