					<p>Hello, I recently installed the maradns package and I&#039;m running into a problem here. maradns starts up without any noticable errors on stdout or syslog. The process is running and there is a listening udp-port on *:53.</p><p>Unfortunately I don&#039;t get any answers from the DNS. If I query for an A-RR from a remote host using &quot;dig&quot; I get the following:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>;; Got answer:<br />;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 28997<br />;; flags: qr; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0</p></blockquote></div><p>So, since I get an answer (at least the SOA-RR) and no errors, I assume maradns is running properly but fails to accept the zone-files. Are there any additional debug-options available to see what actually happens during startup, like loading zones and stuff?</p><p>Another strange thing I noticed is with the askmara utility: If I use it on the server running maradns to query the local DNS I get:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p># Querying the server with the IP 172.20.1.254<br /># Hard Error: Timeout</p></blockquote></div><p>This seems a little strange, since &quot;dig&quot; running on another host does not experience timeouts, see 1st quote above.<br />Regarding firewalls: Since this is a common cause for timeouts,I also investigated along this line: I do run portforwarding on udp+tcp:53 using /etc/firewall.user. But the prerouting/DNAT rule is bound to the external interface only, using &quot;-i $WAN&quot; so it shouldn&#039;t interfere in this case. Also, with dnsmasq I don&#039;t experience any problems, so I thinks it not a problem with iptables.</p><p>I&#039;m running out of ideas here, any input or hint to further debugging is very much appreciated!</p><p>TIA, Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again,<br />I&#039;m really stuck here. I tried playing with different settings but without success. Could somebody please point a lost soul to some documentation for maradns 1.0?</p><p>TIA, Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>Tried that. I even tried a search specifically for &gt;maradns +1.0 0QuickStart&lt; which was the only document mentioned in the maradns 1.0 FAQ which in turn was the only documentation regarding Version 1.0 I found on the maradns.org website...</p><p>EDIT: OK, I downloaded the source for 1.0.36 and got my documentation from there. But just to get this right: Even though this is an &quot;official&quot; and &quot;not-unsupported&quot; package, there is no straightforward way to get the documentation from the web? If this is the case, you can refer future lost souls <a href="http://www.4haus.buettemeyer.net/playground/maradns.doc">here</a>. Or would it be better to put this in the wiki (e.g. in the docs under Config/Software/Application) or is this not necessary, because the forum is searchable? Please note that it isn&#039;t a problem finding maradns documentation, it&#039;s just that maradns was updated to v1.2 end of last year and now uses a completely different (as in file formats and tool names) interface from 1.0.<br />Regarding maradns 1.2: Is there already a port to openwrt available or is somebody working on it? If not I&#039;d consider it a good project for my first development steps on openwrt, but I&#039;d hate to reinvent the wheel...</p><p>EDIT2: If you experience the same effects (e.g. maradns starts but fails to accept your authoritative zones), you are probably missing this section in mararc:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># We must initialize the csv1 hash, or MaraDNS will be unable to
# load any zone files
csv1 = {}</code></pre></div><p>Also, the current sample config has the &quot;run_as_root&quot; parameter enabled. Since I&#039;m not sure about the security implications of this, I preferred to use &quot;maradns_uid=65534&quot; but ymmv....</p><p>Regards, Marcus</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>holyLAN</strong> on 23 Feb 2006, 20:47)</p>
