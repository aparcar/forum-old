					<p>Hi,</p><p>as a total noob to openwrt, I am about to buy a small router - either a GL-AR300M or a GL-MT300A.</p><p>The former uses an Atheros 9531 SoC @650MHz, the latter by a MTK 7620A @580Mhz (this model has an sd-card slot which might come handy...).</p><p>What I would like to understand is what sort of performace I can expect from such devices.</p><p>e.g. would it be a realistic use-case to connect a dvbt-c stick via an active hub and stream tv-programs via tvheadend (availabe for openwrt) over wifi (my old Raspberry Pi can do that)?</p><p>Many thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>morgon</strong> on 20 Jan 2017, 03:20)</p>
