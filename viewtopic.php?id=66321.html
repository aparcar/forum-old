					<p>I have a large batch of wholesale devices without vendor-assigned MAC addresses. Is there an efficient way for me to store a unique value when flashing my OpenWRT image such that the value is preserved even if the user performs a failsafe factory reset? For example, is there a way to set a value in the /rom partition without having to build a new image for each device?</p>									</div>

					<p>Can&#039;t you ask the vendor how are you supposed to use the devices they sold you? A device without a MAC address is pretty much useless, so the vendor must provide a method to store a MAC address on each device.</p>									</div>

					<p>sysupgrade allows for whole files and even directories to be retained, but I believe not single values in config files. You could, however, have the &quot;firstboot script&quot; write the assigned MAC address to a file in the file system somewhere and, if this file is present, prefer to retrieve the MAC from there for insertion into the network config. And finally, retain both that firstboot script and that MAC data file during sysupgrade.</p><p>Edit: Probably not an option for mass deployment, but I believe you can set the MAC address in uboot, too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 10:21)</p>

You basicaly need to add a mac partition where you store the mac, make OpenWRT read the mac from it. Hopefully an attempt to flash OpenWRT&nbsp; by someone else will not nuke the mac partition ( I actually have no clue if it will or not), the bad part is that what he/she will flash is not modified to read and use the mac from the mac partition, but if you get the device back and the mac partition is not nuked you will be able to restore it.<br />The mac partition basicaly somehow takes the role of the part in switch/ethernet rom that store the mac...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thedukesd</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 15:12)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestions to investigate uboot -- that&#039;s promising. These are managed devices with custom code running on top of OpenWRT. No need to handle the case where users flash their own firmware -- in that case, they&#039;re on their own.</p>									</div>
