					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m new to openwrt and i bought especially this router (E1700) for it.<br />I did flash the firmware to 1.0.0 to flash again for openwrt, but here goes the problem : i can&#039;t get the 1Gpbs from the switch (with the original firmware it works)<br />So i tried the 15.05.1, the 15.05 and the nightly build, but still no luck.<br />I tried the 30/30/30 reset too and nothing.<br />I searched on this forum and google and didn&#039;t find any answer.<br />Did someone get the same error ??</p>									</div>

					<p>I am thinking of getting this router, too, but the sole purpose of it is 1Gbps switch to configure VLANs. So if it doesn&#039;t work there is no point of getting it.<br />Can someone confirm it&nbsp; whether it supports VLANs and at 1Gbps?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,<br /> I bought a E1700 and installed OpenWRT and I can confirm that the switch ports are only working at 100Mb/s. It seems that there is a misconfiguration of the MT7530 chip in the drivers.<br />I tried official chaos calmer for the device, tried latest trunk version too but still the ports are limited to 100Mb/s. You can configure VLANs though.</p><p>With the original official firmware the port are working at 1Gb/s with no issue. I think you can configure VLANs too, I can check if someone is interested.</p><p>I&#039;m currently trying to figure out what is wrong with the drivers but having never worked with drivers, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll be able to solve the problem.</p><p>I have serial access to the device (J2 header) and can post boot logs, maybe someone more knowledgeable can help.<br />I also extracted the original firmware and it seems that it is possible to get the original initialization process from it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a Linksys E1700. The Linksys firmware is:<br />Firmware Version: &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.0.00, build 81, Dec 20, 2013</p><p>After I login to the router, select &quot;Setup&quot;, there is &quot;VLAN Setup&quot; next to &quot;Basic Setup&quot;. I have never used VLAN, but it maybe what you are looking for.</p>									</div>
