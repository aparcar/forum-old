					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve got the svn tip to my Ubuntu box, and I can do make menuconfig then make to create a build.</p><p>However:</p><p>1) I don&#039;t seem to get a factory.bin or sysupgrade.bin file as a result (just this lot:<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs-64k<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-uImage-gzip.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-uImage-lzma.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.bin<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.elf<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.gz<br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-vmlinux.lzma<br />)</p><p>2) How do I replicate the build as done to get <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ pgrade.bin</a> ? Do I need to apply special patches? </p><p>3) Does anyone have a working .config that they used, that I could then just hack?</p><p>I&#039;m trying to make a build that leaves stuff out I don&#039;t need, but includes Luci, the ndis driver for tethering Android, and still have room for a few other things.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks!<br />Reading the config file told me I had completely failed to notice that the &quot;Target Profile&quot; selection scrolled down! Doh! Having actually selected &quot;TL-WR703&quot; you get a valid build.<br />I have now successfully done two things:</p><p>1) Built a firmware image that was too big, necessitating soldering a connector to the serial pins in order to unbrick it (if the initial boot can&#039;t create the jffs filesystem, the network won&#039;t start).<br />2) Built a firmware that includes all of the features I want, and still have 700k left in /overlay!</p><p>So, thanks for the catalyst :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Glad it worked.&nbsp; I think a lot of people have had to get out the soldering iron after an early flash--I certainly did.</p>									</div>
