					<p>I essentially use my router for basic tasks like LAN sharing, email, surfing, and typical on-line services like Antivirus, Skype, VPN Crashplan, etc.. I don&#039;t have a local server visible to the Internet (and don&#039;t plan for one)</p><p>I&#039;d like to learn more about network security and thought a great way to learn would be hardening my router to prevent everything else from exiting my network and anything unauthorized from entering. I&#039;d&nbsp; appreciate any input to create a checklist.</p><p>Some general thoughts that seemed sensible to me (I&#039;m assuming this is possible to do on OpenWRT but given there are so many packages and potential options I&#039;m looking to narrow things down)</p><p>1. My first step was to stealth all ports <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50671">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50671</a></p><p>2. Next I&#039;d like to disable/uninstall any unnecessary apps on router (suggestions)</p><p>3&nbsp; Install an IDS like Snort. I&#039;m looking for specific must-dos once installed.</p><p>4. Some program to monitor key files/folders on router (e.g. alerts if modified and/or viewed)</p><p>5. Install OpenVPN on OpenWRT. </p><p>6. Use Iptables to drop my WAN connection if VPN goes down (i.e. to keep unencrypted data from leaking), force OpenWRT to use my VPNs DNS, and possible other fine turning that matches my basic use pattern (suggestions)</p><p>6. Install a blocklist program that should automatically update (from site like iblocklist)</p><p>7. Anything else? (including possibly packages from 3rd parties that don&#039;t appear in OpenWRT package management program)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>21e930c2</strong> on 20 May 2014, 11:30)</p>

Solely because on the computer is the *only* place you can filter based on the actual application generating the traffic. All other firewalls must guess what the application is by looking at the traffic itself, which is both resource intensive and prone to errors.</p><p>Fact is, if you only want to allow specific applications through, any rule or system you set up on an external firewall will be vulnerable to a rogue application that acts the same way as the application you want to allow.</p>									</div>
