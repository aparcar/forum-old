					<p>My update on firmware status:</p><p>I gave up on the CC path:&nbsp; there were no fast and stable mwlwifi/mac80211 combinations I could find.&nbsp; I could get great data rates but no longer than 5-6 days uptime before 5G network would crash.&nbsp; Speed:<br />- talking to another WRT1900AC (V1) in bridge mode (stock firmware) I was getting 40-45MB/sec transfer rates.&nbsp; No linux boxes on remote end so no iperf statistics.&nbsp; I had pulled over a late-model mac80211 driver from trunk to achieve this.&nbsp; That may still be the best 15.05 combo, because:<br />- the recent 15.05 updates to mac80211 improved this to ~50MB/sec, with peaks up to 60MB/sec -- NICE!&nbsp; But even 2G network was unstable with this build.&nbsp; (3.18.27 kernel)<br />- For this reason I moved to trunk (as of roughly 3/9).&nbsp; Word is that 15.05.1 will be moving to kernel 4.4 anyway, and I expected to need to re-setup the router in full anyway, so I just bit the bullet and moved to trunk with kernel 4.4.4.&nbsp; Speeds are again ~50MB/sec, peaks up to 60MB/sec.&nbsp; Again, very nice.<br />- This trunk build is approaching crunch time, in 2 hours it will have been up 5 days.</p><p>As a side project, I&#039;ve worked on getting the remote bridges up and running under OpenWRT.&nbsp; I finally have settled on a method, which is a fully routed client.&nbsp; I toyed with relayd (it works but peak speeds were around 15-20 MB/sec).</p><p>So I now have a portion of my network set up as a different subnet with wireless client access to the main network, fully routed.&nbsp; Fun fun with Windows and Linux clients mixed, but that&#039;s a separate story, it&#039;s a fully working &quot;equivalent&quot; to wireless bridge.<br />- iperf reports 285 Mbits/sec one direction (client network server mode), 97-109 Mbits/sec the other direction (client network in client mode)<br />- file transfers peak at 30MB/sec (client network to AP network), with averages around 20-22 MB/sec.</p><p>So the relayd setup wasn&#039;t actually all that bad, and Belkin/Marvell are holding out on us with driver capability.&nbsp; If the wifi networks prove to be stable, I will likely keep this setup.&nbsp; Speeds are OK (although close to what I was getting with a strictly wireless-N network) but it is pretty awesome in all other respects getting rid of stock.</p><p>As an aside, I was asked (dlang) why I didn&#039;t set this up as a kernel bridge.&nbsp; It has been stated by OpenWRT developers that this driver won&#039;t work in bridge mode and I have painstakingly verified that my crude abilities are incapable of making that mode work.&nbsp; An example was given with a Netgear router setup, and I have no idea what driver is used in that model but I can&#039;t figure a way to get the mwlwifi driver working in bridge mode as a client.</p>									</div>
