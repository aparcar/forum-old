					<p>I to think this is important to some of the commercial deployments it appears OpenWRT is being used in. Wither TR-069 or CWMP - I&#039;m not sure which would be better of OpenWRT</p><p>Since there isn&#039;t an mature OS TR-069 solution, prob need to look at the larger community. Here are two OS CPE projects:<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/tr069/">http://code.google.com/p/tr069/</a><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpe/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpe/</a><br />Got to check out wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069</a></p><p>I think the route for the service providers to go would be to bundle one of the proprietary stacks for now while helping dev one of the OS projects.</p><p>TR-069 Prob isnt going to cover everything OpenWRT user want. Perhaps a better solution would be a cgi interface or a ssh interface to update a master xml file that could parsed. When settings and locations change the update infrastructure can stay the same and the parser is changed. Heck Funambol&#039;s device management may even be used??? Or a we could do like IP phones and just check for updated config xml from http/tftp address.</p><p>-Tom</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tomdavidson</strong> on 19 Oct 2008, 12:25)</p>

					<p>TR-069 to me is clearly a massive intrusion into a system&#039;s integrity and a potential break of the end user&#039;s privacy.<br />Such a &quot;feature&quot; is only requested by commercial ISP or major vendors.

					<p>Knox:</p><p>TR69 is not a massive intrusion on system integrity. It is a management, configuration and support feature essential to large Service Providers to support mass updates of firmware in the field and to do preventative troubleshooting. In contrast to something like VNC, SNMP or even just plain old telnet or SSH, if some change occurs on the CPE side, the device sends a notice (an INFORM) to the Service Provider&#039;s auto configuration server (e.g., the ACS), and based on a stored profile of the customer&#039;s account, the change is logged, allowed or disallowed, and if disallowed, the ACS responds with a set of commands to reset the change. This happens based on rules in the ACS without manual intervention. Very slick and very scalable, and no support calls that cost them $40 per ticket.</p><p>Essentially, it&#039;s a remote control app for configuration, management and support. While not the lightest weight protocol around, it has proven very scalable and secure, which is one reason almost all the consumer ADSL service providers use it.</p><p>It is true, however, that the concept of TR69 goes against the grain of a lot of OpenWRT (and general) users. For example, many Service Providers charge the user for the CPE, so the customer thinks they own it. In the terms of service, it usually states otherwise. This managed CPE belongs to the Service Provider-- and the customer paid for it, which is a benefit to the Service Provider, not the customer. Ouch.</p><p>I can see a TR69 CPE client integrated into OpenWRT quite nicely using UCI commands. This actually solves the biggest issue with commercial Linux offerings... the lack of a consistent management interface to system internals. But some commercial Linux offerings support add on commercial TR69 clients out of the box, but for a hefty cost. For example, Jungo charges NRE ~$50K and a per unit license fee of $5-$20 depending on features and volume. </p><p>marc.</p>									</div>

					<p>No offence. But from my point of view, a &quot;remote control app&quot; remains an intrusion into the system. Especially if it acts without the device owner&#039;s interaction or even knowledge. It might claim to fullfill support and maintenance tasks but in fact it opens a back door to full remote control over a system. One could also call it trojan horse, not?</p><p>As i said before: if one desperatly needs it (for example an ISP or a hardware vendor) it is highly appreciated to contribute a free and open implementation to the community.</p><p>May the source be with you :-)</p>									</div>
