					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I&#039;ve got the latest stable AA release of OpenWRT up and running on my WNDR3700 and it&#039;s working well apart from the WAN connection.<br />There&#039;s a few things I still need to try but I have one quick question.</p><p>My ISP is BeThere in the UK and I&#039;ve put the router in bridge/modem-only mode which normally works fine when using IPCop. But you have to leave it for an hour or so to create a new DHCP lease with my static IP address my new MAC address.</p><p>I was impatient though and tried spoofing the old MAC which didn&#039;t really work so I wanted to just try letting DHCP do its thing.<br />Is there a way to find the original MAC address of the WAN interface of my WNDR3700?</p><p>Should I try deleting the WAN interface, would creating a new one use all the default info?</p><p>Cheers, B</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like the WAN MAC address on Netgear routers might be just the LAN MAC +1 so I will try that tonight as well.</p><p>One question is... how can I try this patch out?</p><p>Can I manually edit dhcp.sh?<br />How can I apply this config without using LuCI, since the front-end has not been patched.</p>									</div>

					<p>I actually got the WAN connection to my ISP working pretty easily in the end.<br />I turned the modem off for the day whilst at work, came back and set the MAC address of the WAN to the LAN MAC +1 and also set it in the client id field. Turned on the modem and it came up straight away.<br />Not sure if it was setting the WAN MAC, client id or letting the existing DHCP lease expire at my ISP (that&#039;s the most likely) but glad it&#039;s working.</p><p>Hope this is useful to someone.</p><p>Cheers, B</p>									</div>
