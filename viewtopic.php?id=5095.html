					<p>Has anyone looked at the fry&#039;s routers? The prices are increadible (~$20 when on sale)&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.airlink101.com/products/router.html">http://www.airlink101.com/products/router.html</a></p><p>Googling has not turned up much info. What are the chances of being able to run linux on one of those routers? Even if it is a tiny variant of linux, like uClinux, the 2.2 kernel, heck I&#039;ll settle for a version of BSD.</p>									</div>
