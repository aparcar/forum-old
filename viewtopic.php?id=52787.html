					<p>I particularly like seeing UART2 there on a router (not to mention UART3 and UART7).&nbsp; I assume TWI2-SDA and TWI2-SCK are I2C, which is also nice.&nbsp; Lots of possibilities for use as a small computer with routing capabilities under openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>This looks like perfect OpenWrt router! I have heard that it can get blazing fast speeds, especially with OpenVPN, nothing in this price range comes close to this performance.... over 300Mbps&nbsp; while EdgeRouter Lite struggles to get over 120 Mbps.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have found problems with all images that I tested (including my own).</p><p>These problems happen only on OpenWrt (15.05).&nbsp; I did not test other OSes very much.&nbsp; I believe these problems don&#039;t happen on other OSes.</p><p>1. The vlan switch stops forwarding packets between ports after a (short) period after boot. Switching between CPU and ports works ok, though.<br />2. Wireless (with WPA) has unexplained packet latency *after a period of inactivity*.&nbsp; It eventually drops out completely *after a period of inactivity* (meanwhile, connected devices think they are still connected, but there is 100% packet loss).&nbsp; If there is constant activity, there is no loss of connectivity.</p><p>From what I read on the forums, lots of people have similar sounding problems.</p><p>The severity of these problems increases with uptime.&nbsp; Eventually, I just have to reboot the device because of so much glitching.</p><p>A possibly unrelated problem is the kernel seems to have some kind of bug.&nbsp; It refuses to load too many modules, complaining about not having enough memory.</p><p>I have been trying to get Sinovoip to fix these problems with OpenWrt images (and in the OpenWrt source) for 1 year!!&nbsp; They keep promising they will check with their engineer but they have not done anything to fix these problems.&nbsp; I am not happy at all with their support.</p><p>I have had 6 of BPI-R1 devices which I bought from 2 different sources.&nbsp; ALL OF THEM have these problems.&nbsp; It is very easily reproducible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>al3x</strong> on 9 Jun 2016, 06:48)</p>
