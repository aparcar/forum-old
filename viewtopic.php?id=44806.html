					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have a new internet connection from german provider O2 which comes along with a VoIP number. The original hardware is total crap so I&#039;m trying to set up my OpenWRT box. But no real success so far.</p><p>O2 uses two pppoe connections, one for common data traffic, one for VoIP only. Both do come up after booting the router and get their IP addresses and DNS servers.</p><p>I succeeded to set up multiwan although the configuration seems to be quite different from the common load-balancing scenarios. Here&#039;s my config with the two interfaces which should route VoIP traffic through the &#039;voip&#039; interface, all other stuff goes through &#039;wan&#039;.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config multiwan &#039;config&#039;

It seems to me that the name can only be resolved by the DNS servers of the &#039;voip&#039; interface and not by the public DNS servers of the &#039;wan&#039; interface. dnsmasq is sending the request to all DNS servers but wan servers are the first ones to answer.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Jun 17 22:38:31 router daemon.info dnsmasq[1285]: query[A] sip.alice-voip.de from 10.0.0.114

					<p>Did you ever solve this issue? (I am asking because I want to do the same thing).</p><p>If not, have you tried to manually put the dns into /etc/host?</p><p>Another possibility would be to have a separate VLAN for VOIP, and one for IP.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>unfortunately I never really solved the issue. I tried the manual /etc/hosts entry which worked for the DNS part. Since STUN issues were the next ones to handle and I never got a stable connection (and my Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H does not properly support vlans on the switch), I decided to keep on using the O2Box for VOIP, enabled PPPoE-PassThrough and put another OpenWRT router afterwards to manage my data traffic towards the internet... sorry.</p><p>Cheers<br />macMeck</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, that is a pity. I have that exact same router on the way - I did not realize it has issues with VLANs on the switch. I wonder what happens if Asterisk is run directly on that router.</p><p>If I have any more ideas, I will post them here.<br />What definitely does work is a Fritz Box 7170 - I replaced the O2 one with that, but the cheap power supply killed the Fritz Box during a power outage recently.</p>									</div>
