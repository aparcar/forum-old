					<p>Hi,<br />I got a second Netgear WGT634U on which one I am trying to install openwrt (svn) with a serial cable (tftp method).<br />The image because of its size is splitted (with dd). No problem to copy the first image part but impossible to copy the second one. <br />I am losing the connection as soon as the first part is copied. I see that with a continuous ping to the router.<br />I never had this issue with my other router. Do you have any idea about how can I fix this?<br />Here are the commands that I am using (my laptop has the 192.168.1.111 ip address)</p><p>CFE&gt; ifconfig eth0 -addr=192.168.1.1 -mask=255.255.255.0<br />Device eth0:&nbsp; hwaddr 00-0F-B5-3F-3C-BE, ipaddr 192.168.1.1, mask 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gateway not set, nameserver not set<br />*** command status = 0<br />CFE&gt; flash -noheader 192.168.1.111:openwrt-wgt634u-jffs2.bin flash0.os<br />Reading 192.168.1.111:openwrt-wgt634u-jffs2.bin: Done. 4194304 bytes read<br />Programming...done. 4194304 bytes written<br />*** command status = 0<br />CFE&gt; flash -noheader -offset=4194304 192.168.1.111:openwrt-wgt634u-jffs2.bin.2 flash0.os<br />Reading 192.168.1.111:openwrt-wgt634u-jffs2.bin.2: Failed.: Timeout occured<br />*** command status = -21</p>									</div>

					<p>Is the router running OpenWRT now, or is it running the stock Netgear system? You could try installing a standard OpenWRT that did not need to be split, then use that to install the larger system.</p>									</div>
