You can set up username/password access but since the protocol is unencryoted, I don&#039;t recommend it. I have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#Anonymous_FTP">anonymous</a> vsftp server set up so people can download files from me and upload files to me without using a USB drive. Files can only be uploaded, but not downloaded from the incoming directory. Files can only be downloaded but not uploaded from the pub directory. If you are worried about packet sniffers, you can encrypt the files. You will then have a completely secure system with FTP. If you are interested, I can post my vsftp configuration files.</p>									</div>
