					<p>Hi:</p><p>I was reading many post&#039;s here about WDR3600 HW 1.5 (and also on dd-wrt) and I am no so comfortable, I guess.<br />According to my understanding the 1.5 version have some changes and also the last firmware (u-boot).<br />Also WIFI I am not sure how stable it is!</p><p>So, I would like to understand the following:<br />- Can I install on this HW 1.5 version and this FW (the last one) the latest BB RC3 for this router and should working fine?<br />- I read some things about strip the boot but that is to return to stock firmware, right?<br />- Or, should wait a little more for BB RC4, I do not no if it&#039;s coming.<br />- The update can be done trough Stock Web Interface and not TFTP.</p><p>I have a Linksys WRT160N v3 acting a Repeater Bridge with WDR3600 as AP and it&#039;s working fine. But, I would like to have some statistics and specially be capable of have cron working and have schedule jobs as I have on Linksys. Also, increase the power, if possible, will be good. </p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>BB RC3 should work according to the wiki and is very stable. Wiki implies the 12.09 may not work, at least as downloaded from the site. </p><p>RC4 will be out fairly soon I think, but you can upgrade at that time if you wish. Of course you&#039;ll want to eventually take 14.07 final when it&#039;s ready too.</p>									</div>
