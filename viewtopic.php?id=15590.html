					<p>Hi - would appreciate if someone here can lend a hand - I am trying to port OpenWRT to the Netgear WNR854T/WNR834M series.&nbsp; They are basically arm-softfloat routers with a decent amount of memory (32Mbytes) and flash (8MBytes), which is rather roomy (just like oldschool WRT54GSes).&nbsp; These are 802.11 draft-n routers running kernel 2.4.27vrs2, with the only substantial difference between the two in the 4 port switch that they are provided with (The 854T uses a Marvel 88E6061 Gigabit Ethernet controller, the 834M uses an 88E5051 FastE controller).&nbsp; I am very interested in porting the OpenWRT code over, but I am having difficulty building a working toolchain so this can happen...</p><p>I followed the instructions as laid out by Woden on the Wiki here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WNR854T">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ar/WNR854T</a></p><p>And was told by Netgear OpenSource support to consult this webpage:</p><p><a href="http://frank.harvard.edu/~coldwell/toolchain">http://frank.harvard.edu/~coldwell/toolchain</a></p><p>And so far I keep running into issues building the precise toolchain.</p><p>Can anyone lend a hand and enlighten me as to what exactly is needed by the build process?&nbsp; If I use crosstool as described on the wiki, the compilation will drop dead right when it begins building glibc.&nbsp; The Coldwell build shell script completes but does not seem to build anything useful.&nbsp; Do I need to match the kernel headers to the original 2.4.27 build and then apply the VRS patches, or can this be built using the 2.6.x series kernel headers as alluded to in these webpages?&nbsp; </p><p>Would appreciate either a hand in this, or a tarball with a working toolchain.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ragefury32</strong> on 29 Nov 2008, 12:21)</p>

					<p>I understand that webupgrade suffix means that this firmware could be loaded to router through it&#039;s original web interface without complicated processes.<br />I&#039;m really interesting how risky is this build and does it supports bridge and other modes</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m agree with you for the images.<br />Now it could be nice if the persons who works on the WNR854 can tell us if it&#039;s ok or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like there are new images (8/10) - any word on the wireless and MAC addressing fixes?&nbsp; I have the WNR-854T and really want to try to get this working up to its potential - and the factory firmware doesn&#039;t come close. I appreciate the efforts done here - I&#039;m willing to try/experiment a bit with mine (I have a WRT-54Gv3.1 with Hyperwrt-Thibor as a nice backup router) if that would be of any help. Wish I knew Linux/firmware coding to be of more help. Thanks!</p>									</div>
