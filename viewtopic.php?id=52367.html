					<p>Hello everyone!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been working on an issue I&#039;ve been having with my Linksys E2000 802.11n router.&nbsp; For reference, the router includes the BCM4717 rev 2 (MIPS 74Kc) SoC as reported by the OpenWRT wiki.&nbsp; While trying to enable 802.11n support I replaced the default b43 driver with the brcmsmac driver by uninstalling the old and installing the new through opkg and rebooting.&nbsp; While the wireless works I&#039;m noticing slower speeds than before on all of my 802.11g devices (around 2 Mbps, down from around 8-10 Mbps) and still no support for 802.11n.&nbsp; I&#039;m using the latest snapshot trunk (Chaos Calmer), openwrt-brcm47xx-mips74k-squashfs.trx.&nbsp; Here are some further details in case it helps:</p><p>dmesg is littered with many messages like this (and I haven&#039;t been able to figure out what they mean through my Googlefu):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>brcmsmac bcma0:0: START: tid 1 is not agg&#039;able

					<p>Has anyone been able to get the brcmsmac driver to work properly on a BCM4717 SoC like what&#039;s on my Linksys E2000?&nbsp; I reverted back to the b43 driver and it instantly tripled the 802.11g connection speed, albeit with no support for 802.11n possible since that driver is incapable of 802.11n.&nbsp; However, the brcmsmac driver didn&#039;t provide 802.11n either, as far as I could tell.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already tried using the config in this post: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46979">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46979</a>, which is essentially the same as what I had.</p><p>After re-reading (for the hundredth times) <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">OpenWRT UCI Wireless</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.broadcom.bcm47xx">OpenWRT bcm47xx</a> I tried changing my /etc/config/wireless to use<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option type broadcom</code></pre></div><p>but then I wasn&#039;t able to even start the wireless.&nbsp; My guess is that this directive is for using the broadcom-wl proprietary driver, kmod-brcm-wl.&nbsp; I was thinking of trying it out but I&#039;d much prefer to use open software if possible.</p><p>If anyone has a working config for the brcmsmac driver (including 802.11n support) I&#039;d be very interested to see it.&nbsp; I thought that maybe my Fedora laptop might be having the issue that it simply selects the 802.11g connection, but looking at the available bitrates on the router using the<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iwlist wlo1 scanning essid &lt;SSID&gt;</code></pre></div><p>command on my laptop I saw the max connection speed for the router is 54 mbps.</p><p>--Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello mfitch,</p><p>have you made any progress on solving your issues with brcmsmac?</p><p>I&#039;m experiencing the same problems with my E2000 and the final release of Barrier Breaker 14.07.</p><p>The b43 gives decent 802.11g speed but does not support 802.11n. The brcmsmac driver seems to support 802.11n, since &#039;iwconfig&#039; on my notebook reports bit rates up to 130 Mb/s, however the actual speed is horribly slow (about 10 Mb/s) and the connection is unstable.</p><p>Therefore I switched to the proprietary wl driver, which runs fine, although I did not entirely understand how to configure the device with this driver. In the end I avoided the graphical web front-end entirely, since it set some values, which limited the speed to 802.11g.<br />The following steps yield working 802.11n for me:</p><p>Remove kmod-b43 or kmod-brcmsmac and kmod-brcmutil<br />Install kmod-brcm-wl wl wlc nas</p><p>/etc/config/wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  &#039;wl0&#039;
