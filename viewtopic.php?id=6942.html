					<p>Hi,</p><p>At the moment I haven&#039;t build yet the serial mod since this week my electronic shop is closed, so I haven&#039;t a serial console yet.</p><p>I had to build the &quot;two week ago release&quot; since yesterday one was broken.</p><p>I can tell you that the firmware build successfully, by only changing brcm-2.4 to brcm-2.6, and no other changes. I uploaded it using tftp (with the same method I used to upload witerussian openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin).</p><p>After upload, dmz led start blinking, after 10 minutes it haven&#039;t stop blinking, so I rebooted the router, and I flashed again openwrt whiterussian.</p><p>Tested on WRT54GL1.1</p><p>B.R.</p><p>Eddi</p>									</div>

					<p>They were drunk (again) when they released brcm-2.6 and forgot to mention that it doesn&#039;t work.<br />I wasted an entire day before discovering that in the forum. Get your serial port working and go back to 2.4.<br />It should have posted loudly in the main documentation. Oh, wait. There isn&#039;t any!</p>									</div>
