					<p>I&#039;m attempting to build Kamikazee trunk for a WGT634U/ BCM947xx/953xx 2.6.&nbsp; I have all package enabled as I like playing around with packages, and rarely know what I&#039;ll want to look at next.</p><p>Unfortunately when I build, Xorg tries to build, and my arch is not supported.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I have not devised a means of figuring out how X is getting pulled in.</p><p>If I go to the Xorg tree in menuconfig, none of the sub-menus work, hitting enter on them refreshes the screen and puts be back in the Xorg tree.&nbsp; Because of this I cannot see which specific packages are trying to get pulled in.&nbsp; </p><p>How can I figure out what is pulling in Xorg and disable it?</p>									</div>

					<p>I can confirm this issue. I have not had a chance to see why it occurs but think it is a bug with the build system due to the recent changes to fix parallel builds and the related metadata tweaks.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably do some regression testing later this week to determine which commit introduced this problem.</p>									</div>
