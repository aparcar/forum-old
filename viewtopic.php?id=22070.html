					<p>I have a Ubiquity Bullet2HP (high power version) that I&#039;m trying to get working as a regular access point and eventually as a mesh point running batman-advanced. </p><p>When I configure it under Kamikaze 8.09.1 (stable) with the madwifi driver, I can associate and maybe ping a few times, but there is pretty much no throughput. The connection will sporadically go to 1Mbps and then drop.</p><p>When I try trunk (r17956) madwifi causes segfaults in ifconfig (ad-hoc mode), and ath5k doesn&#039;t even think there is a radio; no device shows up.</p><p>If I use the original AirOS software (Linux kernel 2.4.27-ubnt0) that uses the old madwifi ath_hal 0.9.17.1u it all works fine.</p><p>How can I turn on debugging for madwifi in Kamikaze stable? Or what tools can I use to help troubleshoot?</p><p>How can I turn on debugging for the ath5k module to see why it doesn&#039;t see anything? The debug option doesn&#039;t seem to be turned on for the module.</p><p>Gus</p>									</div>
