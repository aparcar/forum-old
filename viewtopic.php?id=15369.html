					<p>What is the best value hardware that supports openwrt? We are looking for at least 2 mini PCI interfaces, POE and largeish memory. We have for 4 Pronghorn cards in use at the moment, however the cost of these cards plus the other accessories and mini PCI cards makes each AP quite an expensive option. We have tried CM9, but found that the power output is just not enough. We are currently experimenting this weekend with Ubiquiti XR2.<br />We have not had any experience with ALIX or other SBC.<br />Our plan is to build a mesh network that will initially cover an area of 5 square miles of urban.</p><p>I like the pringhorns and they seem stable, just want to know if there is a less expensive alternative. What are other people using?</p><p>Ade</p>									</div>

					<p>The Ubiquity router-station really rocks,<br />it has 3 mini-pci, 3 lan, usb, poe, 16MB flash, 64MB ram and a MIPS 24K 680MHz processor. All the additional connectors like GPIO, serial and JTAG have labels on the board to be easily identified :-) . It is the one their web GUI contest is based on (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19118">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19118</a>). However the &#039;political&#039; surroundings might develop it&#039;s a nice piece of hardware.<br />Mine came preloaded with OpenWRT r13658, without web interface; everything works out of the box except the second lan port, I just began to search for a suitable switch-configuration.</p>									</div>

					<p>The aforementioned lan issue turned out to be a hardware bug, self-soldering instructions will be on the way :-) . As I understood it&#039;s not vlan capable.</p><p>There are many enclosures out there, some may become expensive to ship because of their weight.<br />This one <a href="http://www.compexshop.com/product_info.php/cPath/21_61/products_id/256">http://www.compexshop.com/product_info. … cts_id/256</a> is very nice and heavy, it is even hf-sealed and is prepared for some more N-connectors.</p><p>That one <a href="http://www.compexshop.com/product_info.php/cPath/21_61/products_id/248">http://www.compexshop.com/product_info. … cts_id/248</a> is a lighter model, slightly lousy somehow, with built in 5GHz-antenna. </p><p>You may even use a plastic box intended for outdoor electric cabeling (IP55 or higher) and find a separate mast-mount for it at your preferred sat-shop.</p>									</div>
