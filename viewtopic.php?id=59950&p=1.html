					<p>I looked at that. I did find a port(?) for the Asus WL-330N unit, but not the preferred WL-330NUL, or any of the other (smallest) units. Looking at the pictures, the WL-330N and WL-330NUL appear to be completely different units. Other than that (the WL-330N), I drew a blank. </p><p>Rather than trying to do the research myself, with all that entails, I think it might be more efficient for me to make a hardware donation.

					<p>Thanks for the explanation, and the suggestion. I&#039;ll take your suggestion, and leave everything as is for the time being. </p><p>BUT... I want to use this box to access my camera; not just to access the camera&#039;s memory cards, but acting as a &quot;wireless tether&quot; if you will. The camera interface is USB 2. In addition to providing access to the memory cards, the camera&#039;s USB interface is also used to control the camera (focus, shutter release, etc, etc). In addition, the camera has a &quot;Live View&quot; mode that streams the scene in front of the lens - I want to access that via wifi for remote viewing. </p><p>So that&#039;s why I asked the question re changes to the USB functionality. As I understand things now, the USB functionality is the biggest (perhaps the only) thing that would need to be changed. The commands to the camera to stream the &quot;Live View&quot;, release the shutter, run autofocus, etc will originate at the PC/iPad/phone via via wifi, then sent to the camera&#039;s USB port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah - there&#039;s some interesting stuff going on over there, but no one seems interested (so far) in talking about how to do this. Most of the hacking seems to be scripts that flash lights. I&#039;ve posted a reply to myself since you you looked at the thread earlier. That reply shows how my Ubuntu system reacted to a connection from the camera, but I got nothing from the router except silence. I sort of expected that; I assume the router kernel is stripped to the essentials. </p><p>My last post proposed a direction; basically to get a driver that can talk to the camera. I&#039;m at the edge of my known world though - I&#039;ve never reverse engineered a device driver, and in my laziness I still hope that won&#039;t be necessary.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is your camera a Canon camera running the chdk software (I ask because of your mention of liveview)? I have some familiarity with this, but am using a dockstar running debian rather than openwrt. What is it you want usb to do that it isn&#039;t doing?</p><p>I am not actually using chdk liveview (because my dockstar is headless), but am using remote shoot via a browser window.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 3 Oct 2015, 15:42)</p>
