					<p>Ok, sorry for replying to mysel, but problem solved, perhaps it helps others:<br />When you looping infinitely follow the instruction in <a href="http://www.google.de/#hl=de&amp;source=hp">http://www.google.de/#hl=de&amp;source=hp</a><br />&amp;q=nervous.it+unbricking&amp;btnG=Google-Suche&amp;meta=&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=nervous.it+unbricking&amp;fp=4cd870bd3f2e3622</p><p>Short the NVRAM to reset as described above and then set ALL variables mentioned in the link, including the MAC adress.. </p><p>for flashing, use the WAN port - and if you connect directly to you PC you have to use a cross cable - the wan port does not accept a patch as the others.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks to all posts here.&nbsp; My WGT634U, which had not been working since May, is now running properly.&nbsp; The necessary steps for me, using a serial cable, were:</p><p>1.&nbsp; Short pins 1 &amp; 2 on the flash chip, as per <a href="http://www.nervous.it/2009/07/unbricking-wgt634u/">http://www.nervous.it/2009/07/unbricking-wgt634u/</a> (This ended the cycling without ever getting to a CFE prompt.)</p><p>2.&nbsp; Set environment variables as per that site.&nbsp; Also set the following: setenv -p kernel_args &quot;console=ttyS1,115200 root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc rw syst_size=8M&quot; (The latter ended a failure to boot successfully)</p><p>3.&nbsp; Make sure your cable is plugged into the WAN socket.&nbsp; You should be able to ping your tftp device from the CFE prompt.</p><p>4.&nbsp; Start the tftp server.</p><p>5.&nbsp; From CFE, flash, for example, as follows:<br />flash -noheader 192.168.1.31:openwrt-wgt634u-k8092rc2-squashfs.bin flash0.os</p><p>6.&nbsp; Wait until programming is done and reboot.&nbsp; OpenWrt should be running.</p>									</div>
