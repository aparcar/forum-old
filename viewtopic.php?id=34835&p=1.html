					<p>Hi all, this is My first post here.</p><p>I have a D-Link TL-MR3420 and flashed the firmware on it.<br />It all seems to work well but I think there is a major flaw in getting a USB dongle to work.</p><p>My only connection I have is from a Huawei E153 USB 3G dongle, I used this before on<br />My Laptop but the D-Link also has a USB port which is able to connect through a USB<br />dongle.<br />Now, what My problem is that I need to update the packages to install certain software<br />but how can I do that if the D-Link is not connected to the internet through the USB<br />3G dongle!!!!<br />I have a Apple Powerbook G4--yes old <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />-- and enabled internet sharing.<br />The main problem is that if I chose the Huawei(connected to laptop)as My internet <br />connection the D-Link is connected but I can not access it because the Ethernet port is<br />not the main active port so can not control it from My web interface.<br />If I set the Ethernet as the main connection then the D-Link is not connected.<br />I need actually two computers to do that but I am in Indonesia right now and have no<br />friends which have a laptop.<br />It&#039;s like wanting to get access to a roof but the ladder is on the roof.<br />I would recommend the developers to include those packages needed for 3G USB in<br />the main firmware.<br />Does anybody has a solution for this?<br />I do actually have a AppleTv with OS X on it but I don&#039;t have a keyboard and mouse for<br />it, I use My laptop to control that and then get the same active port problem.</p><p>Thanks Perry</p>									</div>
