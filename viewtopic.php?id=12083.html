					<p>I have an ASUS running 2.4-kernel 7.06. It is getting bad (slow/unusable) DNS servers from the ISP. I can&#039;t use static settings for the router either. Is there any way to work around this?</p><p>I&#039;ve tried adding dns settings to the /etc/config/network file but no luck - they are ignored. I also tried rewriting the /etc/resolv.conf on boot in the /etc/init.d/custom-user-startup script but as soon as the DHCP lease is renewed it is over-written again. I currently have a cron job that is rewriting the /etc/resolv.conf file periodically but that isn&#039;t a long term solution. </p><p>Is there any way to trigger a script when the dhcp lease is renewed (possibly using hotplug)? </p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>I found the udhcpc docs here: <a href="http://udhcp.busybox.net/README.udhcpc">http://udhcp.busybox.net/README.udhcpc</a>. This indicates that the /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script file should be called anytime a lease is obtained or renewed. I can either tap into this file or figure out how to tap into hotplug since it looks like that file raises hotplug events.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pric0112</strong> on 15 Aug 2007, 20:42)</p>
