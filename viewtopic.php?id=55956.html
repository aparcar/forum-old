					<p>Hey again guys,</p><p>I need some help setting up a router as a relay using relayd. I&#039;ve been through the wiki and on Google and nothing does the trick. I&#039;ve installed relayd and luci-proto-relay so if possible I&#039;d prefer instructions using the luci interface.</p><p>My setup is the following:</p><p>I have a WPA2-Enterprise secured network which I connect to. I want to implement a private wireless network to which I can connect to. The idea is to have LAN connectivity in the private network and simultaneously internet access.</p><p>So, this would be the setup: </p><p>WLAN_Ent (10.0.0.0) -&gt; NAT -&gt; WLAN_Priv (192.168.1.0)</p><p>I&#039;ve successfully connected to the enterprise network as a client and have been able to create another wireless lan that I can connect to using my PC.</p><p>Now the tricky bit: I have internet connectivity on the router, but no connectivity on the computer. On a standard linux machine I&#039;d just activate IP_Foward and it&#039;d be done, but this is proving more difficult. I&#039;ve been fiddling with relayd, and the firewal (even disabling it/ changing rules to accept everything) and nothing does the trick.</p><p>Thanks for your help guys</p>									</div>
