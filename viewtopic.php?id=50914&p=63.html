					<p>Yes, hard drive should be auto mounted out of the box. Linux kernel does not support NTFS write, so it will be read-only. You could install FUSE but performance will not be very good.

					<p>Been re-thinking this whole top domain ad blocking idea, and it just isn&#039;t feasible. Lots of sites host their own ads, let&#039;s say for example&nbsp; ads.foo.com, so blocking the top domain would render the whole site unusable. I&#039;ll be going back to the big hostlist approach, might look into which of the lists are properly maintained to avoid problems with known services.</p>									</div>

Yes I&#039;m using no-ip.com as well !

As explained in the wiki I used the custom URL &quot;http://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@dynupdate.no-ip.com/nic/update?hostname=[DOMAIN]&amp;myip=[IP]&quot; and it&#039;s working fine. My question was if it&#039;s possible to add the SECURE (https) update procedure (user data must be crypted with base64 enconde in the POST content of the request and bla bla bla.). Is anything like that possible with current build and/or packages?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

Doesn&#039;t matter will ask the maintainer. Anyway ... is there a list of included packages in your build?. I&#039;m very new to openwrt architecture so if I got it right, if I wan&#039;t to upgrade one of the included packages I will still be having the old version but will be &quot;overwritten&quot; from the overlay fs (hence using doble the space). The only way of having only the last packages is rebuilding the image. Is this correct?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Panderine</strong> on 12 Mar 2015, 19:48)</p>

					<p>@arokh.</p><p>Hi, yesterday i installed your optimized software on TP-Link Archer C5. I installed the factory firmware because was the first firmware.<br/>Well. After installation i can only activated 2.4Ghz wifi. I&#039;ve tried to change country region to Spain i change channel to 36-38-40, but i never saw the 5Ghz wifi. However, with trunk build we also have problems. The best option was install mk13139 build. With this firmware, after the installation both wifi were running perfectly.</p><p>i don&#039;t know if anyone else has the same problem.</p>									</div>

Did you change anything in that respect? Some sites load the grumpy Chrome face in places where ads normally would appear and load slow, after disabling adblocking everything goes fast again.</p><p>EDIT:<br/>Hmmmm, I have tested it some more, but after a router reboot the slow loading sites now load quickly again (tested it before, but forgot to reboot my PC, oops!) and I see that the adx.com isn&#039;t added in the hosts.block file, so that site won&#039;t work obviously and trying a different site with test.gif added does work. So, it seems to be a problem that starts happening after a while.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 13 Mar 2015, 17:58)</p>

					<p>I built and installed the march 5 version of this build but there&#039;s an issue with sqm-scripts. With sqm-scripts you set your connection&#039;s upload and download speeds. There&#039;s an issue though. I have a 60000 dl and 30000 ul connection, and sqm-scripts always caps my download speed at the lower of the two values -- my upload in this case. I reversed the upload and download speeds, and the issue still persists. The config file is written properly from the GUI so I&#039;m not sure what the issue is.</p>									</div>
