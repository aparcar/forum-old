					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have IPv6 access through SixXS using AYIYA, which I need since I&#039;m behind CG-NAT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m running trunk/DD r48631 on TP-Link WDR-4300 v.1.5.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been able to bring up my SixXS tunnel and IPv6 routing works fine.&nbsp; But I have a question.</p><p>I can only bring up AICCU on the wan6 interface if the wan IPv4 interface is up.&nbsp; Can I bring up the wan6 AICCU/AYIYA connection over wwan instead?</p><p>I&#039;ve thought about it but my networking-fu is too weak.&nbsp; A search yielded no similar questions.</p><p>Do I need to do something special to configure netifd to connect AICCU over wwan rather than wan?&nbsp; Does AICCU support which is built into netifd only support tunneling via wan?&nbsp; If so, I suppose I could try to run aiccu manually like before BB RC1....&nbsp; Or am I asking a stupid question?</p><p>TIA <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>

					<p>Bad form to reply to oneself and all that...</p><p>If anyone finds this as a search result and is looking for a solution to setting up SixXS AICCU/AYIYA over the wwan (wireless client) interface, there are two workarounds I&#039;ve gotten working:</p><p>1.) Just connect the WAN port of the router to your upstream router, DSL or cable modem, etc.&nbsp; Then follow the instructions in the OpenWRT wiki to set up the AICCU tunnel on the wan6 interface.&nbsp; I was able to use LuCI to get this working without difficulty.</p><p>2.) If you use another wireless router as your IPv6 tunnel gateway to SixXS, connect the WAN port of your OpenWRT router to that IPv6 gateway router, then configure the lan interface (under DHCP Server -&gt; IPv6 Settings in LuCI) to use &quot;relay mode&quot; for Router Advertisement-Service, DHCPv6-Service, and NDP-Proxy.</p><p>I had two hiccups with 2.):</p><p>a.) I used LuCI to configure relay mode, but (YMMV) /etc/config/dhcp didn&#039;t get fully configured correctly.&nbsp; I had to edit it with vim and add these lines:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; option ra &#039;relay&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dhcpv6 &#039;relay&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ndp &#039;relay&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option master &#039;1&#039;</p><p>under the &quot;config dhcp &#039;wan&#039;&quot; section.</p><p>b.) I had to reboot the router.&nbsp; I tried reloading odhcpd (as well as network and firewall, for other reasons) from CLI (/etc/init.d/odhcpd reload) but when my client connected it didn&#039;t have IPv6 routing upstream.&nbsp; A reboot and a reconnect, then being patient to wait a bit for things to settle down, got it working fine.</p><p>Well done, OpenWRT developers!!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />&nbsp; HTH.</p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>
