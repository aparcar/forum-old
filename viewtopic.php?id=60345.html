					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have Asus WL-500GPv2 and I am unable to use trunk revisions after 47006 (which I currently have). See <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20596">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20596</a> for details.<br />I am also unable to boot into failsafe mode to try run init process manually (I have found some recommendations on <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a> how to enter failsafe on this router, but none of them work).<br />I haven&#039;t build serial console cable and I&#039;m not planning it, so </p><p>Anyone else had similar problems?</p><p>RN</p>									</div>
