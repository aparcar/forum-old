					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m working on a RaspberryPi project that uses Wifi. I&#039;d like to port it to OpenWRT running on an actual router so that I can&#039;t relieve my RPi. The issue is, I&#039;m also using a Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle. Any suggestions as to what type of (cheap) router I should buy?</p><p>I looked at some TP-Link routers, but they all seem to have MIPS chipsets.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think that this ARM module is what you looking for:<br /><a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2014/03/31/30-corewind-tech-wifig25-som-features-atmel-sam9g25-arm9-soc-and-a-wi-fi-module/">http://www.cnx-software.com/2014/03/31/ â€¦ fi-module/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Great find, Abdulbasit! Thanks a lot for the pointer!</p><p>The only issue I see with that one is that it requires substantial work to get started, right? A new PCB needs to be designed that can supply it with power, for instance? As I understand, there is no DC jack?</p><p>I also found this, which can also be useful:<br /><a href="http://store.linksprite.com/pcduino-lite-wifi/">http://store.linksprite.com/pcduino-lite-wifi/</a></p><p>It seems to be directly supported by OpenWRT as well. So as I understand, I can even find a pre-packaged OpenWRT image for it?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the architecture is not that important when using Linux and the ARM modules are mainly made for processing power and graphics and thus they are quite expensive in compare with MIPS ones.<br />And there is a lot of boards and modules that offers decent processing power (up to 400MHz) ,USB(for your Bluetooth), WiFi, Ethernet and GPIO&#039;s.<br />For example , this &quot;MONSTER&quot; is only for $13.5:<br /><a href="http://www.hlktech.net/product_detail.php?ProId=43">http://www.hlktech.net/product_detail.php?ProId=43</a><br />and the famous TL-WR703N router for under $20.</p>									</div>
