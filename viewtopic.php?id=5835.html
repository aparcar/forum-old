					<p>Hi!</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Does anyone know anything about gpio bits as interrupt sources?</p></blockquote></div><p>I made some basic experiments with that and it seemed to work. </p><p> *** WARNING: Use the following at your own risk. There&#039;s no guarantee that it works, and it might damage your hardware. ***</p><p>You need to fiddle with some hardware registers. Some are accessible through the the sbh structure using sb_xxx() functions: sb_gpiointmask() and&nbsp; sb_gpiointpolarity(). However, setting the bit in gpiointmask is not enough to trigger interrupts. You also have to enable GPIO interrupts in general. For that you have to get hold of the so called chip common configuration registers.<br />Here&#039;s a code snippet I hacked into drivers/net/diag/diag_led.c (I used the reset button as interrupt trigger):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if (!(pdev = pci_find_device(VENDOR_BROADCOM, SB_CC, NULL))) {
        printk(KERN_ERR &quot;bcm4710_pcmcia: cc not found\n&quot;);
        return -ENODEV;
}
ccregs = (chipcregs_t *) ioremap_nocache(pci_resource_start(pdev, 0), pci_resource_len(pdev, 0));
intstatus = readl(&amp;ccregs-&gt;intstatus);
intmask = readl(&amp;ccregs-&gt;intmask);
writel(intmask | CI_GPIO, &amp;ccregs-&gt;intmask);
request_irq(3, diag_interrupt, SA_SHIRQ, &quot;diag&quot;, &amp;dev);

sb_gpiocontrol(sbh,reset_gpio,0);
sb_gpioouten(sbh,reset_gpio,0);

sb_gpiointmask(sbh,reset_gpio,reset_gpio);
sb_gpiointpolarity(sbh,reset_gpio,0);</code></pre></div><p>My interrupt handler:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>static chipcregs_t *ccregs;
static  void    diag_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
    int intstatus;

    printk(&quot;diag_interrupt: %d\n&quot;, irq);
    intstatus = readl(&amp;ccregs-&gt;intstatus);
    printk(&quot;intstatus: 0x%08x\n&quot;, intstatus);
    
}</code></pre></div>									</div>

An interrupt line should never be hold as long as an external button without further logic can be pressed. You will stop the whole machine as long as you hold the button pushed. I ran into that problem when hadn&#039;t got the interrupt polarity right.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the choices are somewhat limited; either continuous polling or interrupt driven -- which would have to include masking so you didn&#039;t get stuck in the interrupt handler.</p>									</div>
