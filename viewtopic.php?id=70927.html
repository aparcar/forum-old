					<p>Hi,<br />I recently acquired a single TP-LINK TL-MR3040.&nbsp; My needs are as follows:<br />My job requires me to connect to small subnets (in a cabinet) while I am out in the field.&nbsp; These subnets do not have a DHCPD server.&nbsp; While they are not isolated subnets, I don&#039;t typically have prior knowledge of IP ranges or GW.<br />In order for me to manage the devices in the cabinet, I have to locate a sticker in the cabinet with IP information, assign an unused IP to my PC, and run a cable to a switch in cabinet before I can manage any of the field devices.&nbsp; In fair weather, this is not a problem.&nbsp; However, when it is raining, I don&#039;t want to stand next to cabinet with an exposed labptop.&nbsp; I have a long cat5 cable I carry with me which allows me to sit in my truck.&nbsp; However, I would rather do this wirelessly. I am currently using stock firmware on my TP-LINK.&nbsp; However, this requires that I reconfigure the TP-LINK differently for every subnet.&nbsp; I am hoping I can get away without doing this.&nbsp; Remember, these small subnets do not have a DHCP server.</p><p>What I would like, is true ethernet bridging functionality.&nbsp; If I must, I have no problem acquiring a second TP-LINK device. I just want to arrive at cabinet, connect TP-LINK to switch.&nbsp; Connect wirelessly to it (via onboard wireless NIC or via a second TP-LINK), assign IP address to my PC and have connectivity to field devices without having to configure TP-LINK every time as the subnet will be different every time.<br />Any recommendations on how to go about this?&nbsp; Do I need to purchase a second TP-LINK?<br />Regards,</p>									</div>

					<p>Use AP(WDS) mode in the cabinet, and another router as Client(WDS).&nbsp; Once you have the pair configured you can just plug them in and use like a long Ethernet cable.&nbsp; Any IP address will pass through since they are bridged at level 2.&nbsp; Make sure that the IPs you assign to the routers for configuration are not the same as any you might encounter in the field.</p><p>If you run Linux on your laptop you may be able to set its built in wifi to WDS client.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 16 May 2017, 13:53)</p>

					<p>Sounds like you want to:<br />1) turn off the DHCP server on the TP-LInk,<br />2) plug the cabinet network into a LAN port on your TP-link router<br />3) take a photo of the cabinet IP address sticker with your phone<br />4) connect to the TP-Link with your laptop<br />5) manually address your laptop, based on the cabinet sticker info</p><p>Enjoy working from your warm dry truck.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes thinking about this some more, if there is only one MAC on one side of the bridge (the laptop), even regular AP mode will work.</p>									</div>

					<p>The main router (not the bridge) shouldn&#039;t care about how many MACs it sees on its LAN side (of course there is a limit, but it should be quite high).</p>									</div>
