					<p>I&#039;d like to be able to take my laptop (with no wifi) and my wrt54g with me when I travel, so I can get online at airports, hotels, etc (anywhere I can plug in the router pretty much). However, I havn&#039;t been able to get openwrt to connect to the open hotspots I encounter. </p><p>I&#039;ve been able to find them by setting up openwrt as a kismet drone, I&#039;m just a bit lost as far as connecting to one and then bridging that connection to my laptop. </p><p>Any help is appreciated, if I missed this in the documentation please let me know. Thanks for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know it&#039;s not exactly what you asked, but... Have you considered the WTR54G unit? With the stock firmware it can connect to open WiFi networks and create a small hotspot of your own.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply stangri. I didn&#039;t know that the stock firmware could do that, could you point me in the direction to read more about this? I&#039;ve looked on linksysinfo with no luck, and done a bit of googling but have come up dry. </p><p>The hotspots I&#039;d like to connect to have no restrictions or anything like that, they&#039;re just public and open. Most of the stuff I&#039;ve seen about connecting a router to another router like that involved access to the source router, which I obviously don&#039;t have.</p>									</div>
