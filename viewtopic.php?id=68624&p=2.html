					<p>I would like to try building out XEN onto the hardware. It&#039;s a really cool prospect as the CPU+SATA/USB3.0 support make the router capable of having good storage and working as a Virtualization host for a few light weight type systems.&nbsp; In addition, I would like to see about porting GlusterFS to the system and undertaking that type of work to use it as a 3rd mirror in my current GlusterFS based network. My past work has been working with a Raspberry PI and making Micro Industrial servers that serve dual purposes of routing/connectivity and running a small scaled server that handles local and mirrored data for an IOT configuration to track Air Quality Data.</p>									</div>

					<p>My activities in about 7 years of OpenWrt include a lot of forum support in the hardware hacking section, some wiki maintenance and occasional participation in the development process (adding support for a router and some device drivers, upgrading kernel for some architectures). Other than that, I did a lot of patch reviews, related to the Linux kernel, and some development for environment sensors (with IoT in mind). Outside the OpenWrt world, I have fixed some bugs in open source software, whenever I stepped over them.<br />With the new WRT3200ACM, I could participate in testing and bug-fixing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am OpenWRT enthusiastic. My WRT54GL v.1.1 is little bit worn-out (too much mods) and need rest.</p><p>My past developement are related to different platforms. I.e. linux based set-top satellite receivers plugins (like Drembox Enigma2 movie player cold SubsDownloader) and vintage car radio replacement kit (hardware= PIC18F mcu + TDA7418 + VMusic3 + MonkeyBoard DAB+ reveiver + tda7580 , software written in C).</p><p>My software development on WRT3200 :</p><p>At this moment I am developing some home controller unit based on Microchip PIC mcu (climate solution like heating/ air conditioning, alarms, doors/ windows control, lighting, etc). WRT3200ACM would provide Human-Machine Interface website server. So to develop is some tinyHTTP CGI-bin server or similar web solution.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>BTW: Do Linksys predicts their own app store to this line of routers? Something like android Google play,&nbsp; iOS iTunes or Enigma2 plugin system? This routers have huge amount of flash so third part apps could be written by developers directly to original firmware and sold/ available directly in their firmware?</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silelis</strong> on 28 Nov 2016, 13:02)</p>

					<p>My first encounter with Linksys products started many years back beginning with WRT54G, WRT54GL and WAP54G. All are solid performance during that era and are still working till today.</p><p>I don&#039;t have any AC router so hopefully I&#039;m selected for this giveaway as I would really like to explore OpenWrt further on this router.</p><p>Thank you and happy holiday.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would be interested in getting one. I&#039;ve already done quite a bit of rework on the mvebu target, and getting such a device would help with doing some more.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would be interested in receiving one.</p><p>I started using OpenWrt on a WRT54G and turned into a contributor when working on multimedia and in-home streaming. This included dragging ffmpeg kicking and screaming into the present.</p><p>My interest in the hardware is in improving media streaming, and transcoding with the same. The e-sata and usb3 ports also have me hopeful as my current router is choked on USB performance.</p>									</div>
