					<p>I received two of these antennas from a friend. He said they are for wifi, but has no idea on the band.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/F7KvKsD.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/F7KvKsD.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like dual band. The shorter patches are about 1/4 wave on 5 GHz, the longer ones are for 2.4 GHz.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, interesting. Thanks!<br />Considering that 2.4GHz is roughly half of 5GHz, would a let&#039;s say 5GHz antenna give some reduced performance on 2.4GHz or vice versa?</p>									</div>

					<p>It would, but don&#039;t count on it. It is science, but it is dark science. Remember your engineering courses? Your practice of &quot;connecting an antenna in parallel to an existing one&quot; is totally outrageous.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was planning on connecting these ones on an older router.<br />At the moment I did connect in parallel to the dual band ones from the 4300 a set of double biquad omni directional ones, and I must say they work a treat! Best results are with power at 18-19dBm. And the alignment is very important for data speed. I&#039;ll try and remove the original two dual band ones from the 2.4GHz line and see if there&#039;s any change. The single 5GHz one does the trick very good on the first floor. I get full signal everywhere in the room, maxed at 100mbps.<br />But I do intend on starting on learning radio. The tinkering I did last few days made me more curious.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bob808</strong> on 5 Nov 2016, 19:13)</p>
