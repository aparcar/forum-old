					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am currently using OpenVPN on two WRT54GL&#039;s and notice a Sine curve like traffic fluctuation.&nbsp; What I mean to say is, there seems to be cyclical delays during traffic sends.&nbsp; It is almost a galloping.&nbsp; In efforts to try and combat this I am wondering if anyone has modified OpenVPN to be compiled using threads.&nbsp; The default configure from OpenWRT for v2.0_rc15 is:</p><p>efine Build/Configure<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $(call Build/Configure/Default, \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --disable-pthread \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --disable-debug \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --disable-plugins \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --enable-management \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --disable-socks \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --enable-password-save \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ac_cv_func_epoll_create=no \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br />endef</p><p>I am tempted to remove the --disable-pthread and see what happens.&nbsp; Does anyone know of any implications for stability if doing so?&nbsp; Also, has anyone seen this traffic galloping, and if so what did you do?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Erik</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello all, it appears there is no multi-threaded support for OpenVPN 2.0:</p><p>OpenVPN 2.0 has no multithreading support, this is the only feature present in <br />1.x which has been removed from 2.0.</p><p>Reasons for removing it:</p><p>The original rationale for having the TLS thread optimization was to improve <br />latency during the TLS key negotiation which is very CPU intensive.&nbsp; The 1.x <br />pthread implementation uses pthreads only for this very special case, which <br />does not improve overall efficiency on multiprocessor machines, but helps to <br />keep tunnel-forwarding latency down during the TLS negotiation.</p><p>I did some testing on 2.0 to determine the worst-case latency caused by the <br />TLS negotiation in single threaded mode.&nbsp; On a 2GHz x86, the worst-case <br />latency was about 160 milliseconds for a 2048 bit key and 40 milliseconds for <br />a 1024 bit key.&nbsp; Even with 100 users hitting a TLS renegotiate once per hour, <br />the probability that two or more of these 160 millisecond latency periods <br />would overlap to make a bigger latency is still quite small.</p><p>I think these latency numbers are too small to justify the extra level of <br />complexity entailed by multithreading.&nbsp; Not to mention whole classes of <br />potential bugs which arise when you attempt to multithread code, and <br />incompatibilities that exist between multithread implementations on different <br />OSes.&nbsp; Bottom line is that I don&#039;t think multithreading in OpenVPN is worth <br />the trouble.</p><p>Having said all that, I understand that certain applications which are <br />extremely latency dependent, such as VoIP, might hiccup with the above <br />latency numbers.&nbsp; Especially if you&#039;re running VoIP on a slow server with big <br />RSA keys.&nbsp; Probably everyone else wouldn&#039;t even notice whether or not the TLS <br />negotiation is multithreaded.</p><p>Keep in mind that people use multithreading to:</p><p>(1) improve latency, or<br />(2) improve performance on multithreaded machines</p><p>OpenVPN 1.x only tried to hit (1).</p><p>With OpenVPN 2.0, my decision was basically that (1) didn&#039;t justify the <br />complexification that pthread support would entail and that (2) is satisfied <br />by different means.</p><p>So how do you improve performance on multithreaded machines, to take advantage <br />of all processors, i.e. if (1) is not worth the effort, then how to <br />accomplish (2)?</p><p>Answer:&nbsp; Run multiple server mode daemons on different ports, and have the <br />client load balance between them by using multiple &quot;remote&quot; entries in the <br />client side config.&nbsp; This is actually more efficient than multithreading <br />because each OpenVPN daemon gets its own private virtual memory address <br />space, so there is no bus contention from multiple processors over the same <br />address space, as would occur with a multi-threaded execution model.</p><p>James</p>									</div>
