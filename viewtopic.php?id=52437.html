					<p>OK first off I don&#039;t know which I&#039;m going to go for, but first of all does it matter if you install generic packages from opkg? I don&#039;t know why it&#039;d really matter too much. I was looking at the brcm47xx mips 74k for the packages as the snapshot build doesn&#039;t have as many, which I didn&#039;t expect it to. As I was going to try to get either privoxy or pixelserv.</p><p>I don&#039;t know which I&#039;ll be going for as I don&#039;t like using the safebrowsing google thing as I don&#039;t want to be giving them info and would rather just use malware url list for the blocking of the sites.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a FYI, if you already have LuCI/uhttpd installed then you can use that webserver to serve the transparent gif. You don&#039;t need pixelserv. Here&#039;s how I got it set up:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># uci show network.alias
network.alias=interface
network.alias.ifname=br-lan
network.alias.proto=static
network.alias.ipaddr=192.168.1.254
network.alias.netmask=255.255.255.0</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code># uci show uhttpd.pixelserv
uhttpd.pixelserv=uhttpd
uhttpd.pixelserv.listen_http=192.168.1.254:80
uhttpd.pixelserv.home=/www_blank
uhttpd.pixelserv.error_page=/blank.gif</code></pre></div><p>You&#039;ll want to change your main uhttpd listen addresses to only listen to your LAN address as well i.e. 192.168.0.1 and not 0.0.0.0.</p><p>Then you just add your pre-formatted hostfile (entries pointing to 192.168.1.254) as addnhosts list in /etc/config/dhcp and you&#039;re done.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>ah ok, I don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t think of it, I&#039;m sure that uhttpd is already installed as I was using the web interface. One thing I&#039;d like to ask still is if it&#039;s OK to install packages from the generic mips74k broadcom packages from the snapshot. Obviously not the core-utils since there were some things that didn&#039;t work with my rt-n16 that caused me to have to use an svn build.</p><br /><p>P.S.</p><p>Thanks for the help by the way as that is a great idea since it&#039;ll save me extra cpu cycles/wasted memory on the thing.</p><p>Is there any way to compress the hosts file/force it to only live within ram as in only keep it in ram and redownload whenever the thing is forced to reboot as my router only has 32MiB of flash and 128MiB of ram and I&#039;d rather it be on a tmpfs but I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s possible to really do a redirect on the hosts file itself and point to a tmpfs mount.</p>									</div>

					<p>If it&#039;s the same arch as you have, sure.</p><p>&quot;Only&quot; 32MB? I&#039;ve been keeping my 1MB big hosts file on squashfs with my WNDR3700v1 which has 8MB flash. Keeping it in the image will compress it by default so it doesn&#039;t really take 1MB.</p><p>If you simply want to keep it in RAM just download it to /tmp every boot. That will eat double the RAM though as you keep the actual file in tmpfs and load it into RAM at the same time.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK so I know it&#039;s been a really long time since I last posted but I got really side tracked, but anyway. Is it really not possible to have those things being forwarded to localhost/etc? Or is it truly better to force it into the lan port.</p><p>Finally it should be OK to have the hosts file not have each entry pointing towards 192.168.x.y, and instead point to something that&#039;s shorter like. blockem. And then at the top of the hosts file include a line that says that blockem is actually 192.168.x.y?</p>									</div>
