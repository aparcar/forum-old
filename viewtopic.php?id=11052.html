					<p>Hi.&nbsp; This is my first attempt at building a package.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to compile Python.&nbsp; Everything was going great until this error:</p><p>checking for %zd printf() format support... configure: error: cannot run test program while cross compiling</p><p>I took a look inside the configure.in file (<a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/configure.in">http://svn.python.org/projects/python/t â€¦ nfigure.in</a>), and discovered the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>AC_MSG_CHECKING(for %zd printf() format support)
AC_TRY_RUN([#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main()
{
    char buffer[256];

#ifdef HAVE_SSIZE_T
typedef ssize_t Py_ssize_t;
#elif SIZEOF_VOID_P == SIZEOF_LONG
typedef long Py_ssize_t;
#else
typedef int Py_ssize_t;
#endif

    if(sprintf(buffer, &quot;%zd&quot;, (size_t)123) &lt; 0)
           return 1;

    if (strcmp(buffer, &quot;123&quot;))
    return 1;

    if (sprintf(buffer, &quot;%zd&quot;, (Py_ssize_t)-123) &lt; 0)
           return 1;

    if (strcmp(buffer, &quot;-123&quot;))
    return 1;

    return 0;
}],
[AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
 AC_DEFINE(PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T, &quot;z&quot;, [Define to printf format modifier for Py_ssize_t])],
 AC_MSG_RESULT(no))</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, it is attempting to run a small C program to check whether this printf feature is available on the architecture, but it can&#039;t because I&#039;m not compiling on the architecture.&nbsp; At this point I&#039;m out of my depth.&nbsp; Does anybody know what the result of this test should be on mipsel, and how to hardcode that into the configure.in file?&nbsp; Going to need to put that in a patch to make the package compile.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can compile that small code using ./staging_dir_mipsel/bin/mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc (from the BuildRoot or the SDK), it will create an executable that you can copy to your openwrt system, and run it. I&#039;ve did that, it returned with 0, so it looks like uClibc has that z modifier implemented.<br />My suggestion about configure.in, that you replace that whole section you just copy-pasted with a single line:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>AC_DEFINE(PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T, &quot;z&quot;, [Define to printf format modifier for Py_ssize_t])</code></pre></div><p>and then run autoconf. Next time you run configure, it&#039;ll set that variable in pyconfig.h, without running that little code. Now you can make a patch from the resulting configure and/or configure.in, place it in your patches directory, and you&#039;re done. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lazics</strong> on 7 Jun 2007, 00:08)</p>
