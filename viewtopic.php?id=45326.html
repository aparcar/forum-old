					<p>I have a TP-Link WR2543ND running Attitude Adjustment 12.09. My aim right now is to just get my wired ports speaking VLANs. The configuration I am trying to implement is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Port 1 on the switch will be left untouched so that we can always administer it by plugging in and accessing the switch via 192.168.1.1.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Port 4 is our trunking port, allowing tagged traffic on VLANs 32 and 33 to flow freely. It connects the WR2543ND to the rest of the network via another switch which is configured to receive/transmit tagged traffic on VLANs 32 and 33.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Port 2 is an untagged port allowing us to access VLAN 32.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Port 3 is an untagged port allowing us to access VLAN 33.</p><p>My thinking is that all I have to do is change the WR2543ND&#039;s switch configuration to add VLANs 32 and 33, tag both on port 4, untag 32 on port 2, and untag 33 on port 3. With that done, my expectation is that I could plug a machine into port 2 or 3 and have access to the appropriate VLAN. Instead, its as if I never messed with the switch configuration at all.</p><p>I&#039;m doing this through Luci, but checking the configuration files shows them as being what I would set them too if I configured it by hand. Plugging a laptop into either of ports 2 or 3 yields an address via DHCP on 192.168.1.0 and traffic is NATed out to the Internet on the WAN port just as before.</p><p>Any suggestions? Obviously, one must do more than change the configuration of the switch, but what?</p><p>I have ran into <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=200251">this post</a>, which seems to shed some light on my situation, but I&#039;m still digesting it.</p>									</div>
