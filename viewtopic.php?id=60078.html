					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve made some tests. You&#039;re right, for some reason sometimes the 5G wifi radio gets disabled by itself when configuring the interfaces. However after restarting the router, both wifi radios 5G and 2G apparently are enabled and working again (I didn&#039;t try to connect stuff to them).</p><p>About stability, well the b43 drivers are reverse engenireed code.</p><p>The Barrier Breaker firmware posted at the wiki you used previously, uses the propietary wl drivers. There are also some problems with them. You could also test the wl drivers under Chaos Calmer, first remove kmod-b43 and wpad-mini, then install wlc, nas, and kmod-brcm-wl drivers. But don&#039;t expect they will work, or work fine.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Edit</strong>: more tests reveals that some 5G channels won&#039;t work.
