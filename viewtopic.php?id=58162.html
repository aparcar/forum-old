					<p>Hi all,<br />I want continue to optimize ddns-scripts.

Most of them should be fixes or no longer necessary in ddns-scripts 2.x.</p><p>Are all the offered services in <strong>/usr/lib/ddns/services</strong> working with the given url&#039;s or are there updates needed.<br />Are the scripts for CloudFlare.com, No-IP.com and nsupdate working without problems ?<br />Are the providers also supporting IPv6 address updates ? so they can be added to the <strong>/usr/lib/ddns/services_ipv6</strong> file.<br />.....</p><p>So please give me feedback if something does not work as expected.<br />Christian</p>									</div>

					<p>@Borromini<br />HTTPS is used by wget or curl to send the update to the ddns provider. Here your username and password is used.<br />If ddns-scripts check the net if update has happen the commands nslookup or BIND host are used. They do not support security (for what if you request your IP via DNS). If you want to secure your DNS requests you should secure dnsmasq package.<br />If ddns-scripts try to detect your local IP via web it&#039;s also not secured. Simply calling <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.com">http://checkip.dyndns.com</a> or what ever you configured.</p>									</div>

					<p>A bit late to the party here but I can confirm that it wont work a subdomain on namecheap.</p><p>Namecheap uses the following URL pattern.<br /><a href="https://dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com/update?host=">https://dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com/update?host=</a>[host_name]&amp;domain=[domain.com]&amp;password=[domain_password]&amp;ip=[your_ip]</p><p><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/29/11/how-do-i-use-the-browser-to-dynamically-update-hosts-ip">https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowl … e-hosts-ip</a></p><p>You can cobble together something that will work for a level 2 domain (example.com) but the problem is when you try and use a subdomain such as (awesome.example.com).

					<p>I noticed a weird problem with ddns-scripts 2.4.3-1 under CC 15.05 (the release version). While the initial update of the IP seems to be correct after a while it keeps sending an old IP to the no-ip provider.</p><p>Let me give you an example:<br />The interface I set in the config as the source for the IP has IP A. Starting the ddns daemon will send this IP to the ddns provider and wait for an hour (my check interval). If in the meantime the IP changed to B it will still think the old IP A is the current one and not update the IP of the ddns provider. According to the log it would still detect the same IP A for the interface despite the interface page in LuCI or ifconfig reporting a different IP B. When I would use another computer to update the IP of the ddns provider (say using ddclient), the script would detect the IP on the ddns service differs from the one it THINKS is the public IP on the next check and overwrites it with the old IP A again too.<br />According to the log nothing was done during the time the IP of the interface changed. Shouldn&#039;t there be an ifdown/ifup event to be detected? I am aware this could be an issue in other parts of OpenWRT, but the resending of the old IP is odd still.</p><p>I then stopped the ddns daemon and started it manually as described in the wiki. Then it seems to send the correct CURRENT IP to the service. However I assume once the interface would change IP it would suffer from the same issue again.</p><p>If you need further info to debug, please let me know.</p><p>Another thing I noticed that happens but is unnecessary, is that the script seems to send a dummy IP to no-ip even if the registered and current IP differ. I understand the role of the dummy IP for no-ip.com but in this case it would be sufficient to skip this step and simply send the new IP to the service.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also ran afoul of the Namecheap subdomain issue.</p><p>If you have only one subdomain to update with Namecheap, such as the FQDN of your router, you can simply edit /usr/lib/ddns/services and replace [DOMAIN] with the domain name to pass in the namecheap.com service definition.</p><p>Then, edit /etc/config/ddns and update the domain option to pass the FQDN--which is what the script expects.</p><p>Restart the DDNS service (/etc/init.d/ddns restart) to make the change take effect.</p>									</div>

					<p>@BambooVsCacti<br />As you discribe this works fine.</p><p>The documented way is to use Service &quot;--custom--&quot; and copy the modified URL to the &quot;Custom URL&quot; shown in LuCI UI, if you select &quot;Custom Service&quot;.<br />All files inside /usr/lib/ddns Directory including &quot;Services&quot; and &quot;services_ipv6&quot; might change with the next patch or version without notice.<br />A &quot;Custom Url&quot; is saved in /etc/config/ddns configuration file.</p><p>Without LuCI UI you need to remove &quot;option service_name&quot; and add &quot;option update_url&quot; with your custom URL directly in /etc/config/ddns.</p><p>Christian</p>									</div>
