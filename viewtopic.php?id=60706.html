					<p>HI. I install openwrt 15.05 Chaos Calmer version x86 generic,</p><p>openwrt x86&nbsp; has only one NIC and I wish to connect with other device switch that has vlans (openwrt 12.09 tplink)&nbsp; this because with only one NIC i would not be able to has a LAN and WANs port</p><p>so I read that I need to set a 802.1q TRUNK vlan that connect openwrt 15.05 x86 PC with switch openwrt 12.09 router</p><p>the switch router &#039;wr740n&#039;&nbsp;
