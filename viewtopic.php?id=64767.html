					<p>I have purchased LinkIt Smart 7688 &amp; Breakout for LinkIt Smart 7688 from seeed studio. It is based on Mediatek 7688 soc &amp; Openwrt Chaos Calmer.</p><p>My target project is mjpg-streamer along with Asterisk &amp; Beresip running on same LinkIt Smart 7688 board.</p><p>But I am just Fed up with the USB support of LinkIt Smart.</p><br /><br /><br /><p>I switch to USB audio. I have connect USB audio card through a USB hub as the USB audio card doesn&#039;t work directly with LinkIt Smart USB port. I have installled kmod-usb-audio and found amazing result. Audio playback &amp; recording both working with mono channel and 8000 rate. I test sip call with baresip and found satisfactory result.</p><p>The issue I found as follows:</p><p>1) USB issue<br />===============<br />I turn to check mjpg-streamer. I have connected logitech USB cam (HD720p) to usb hub and started mjpg-streamer with desire configuration and found excellent result.</p><p>Now I tried to play audio (through USB audio card), vary bad.. no luck. The audio is not getting played. Error: set_params:1297: Unable to install hw params:</p><p>This USB issue I found in LinkIt Smart.</p><p>I stop mjpg-streamer and audio is getting played. Now I started mjpg-streamer while audio is continue .. no luck.. mjpg-streamer is not started.</p><p>So the conclusion is both USB device is not working simultaneously. Only one USB device can work at a time.</p><p>To check the performance of USB camera, USB audio card &amp; USB hub I have replaced LinkIt Smart board with WrtNode board and run same thing and found amazing result. USB camera &amp; USB sound card both are working simultaneously.</p><p>WRTnode, which is based on Wi-Fi AP-Soc, is an open source development board hardware. There is a Mediatek MT7620n chip in it.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.wrtnode.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">http://wiki.wrtnode.com/index.php?title=Main_Page</a></p><p>Please note that I have test LinkIt Smart with both Firmware version v0.9.2 &amp; v0.9.3.</p><p>Can anybody tell me uhat is the issue with USB of Openwrt Chaos Calmer????<br />If there is on issue with Openwrt CC the issue may only with LinkIt Smart Firmware version v0.9.2 &amp; v0.9.3 then somebody help me how to build Openwrt CC/BB from from MT7688 SDK (available in openwrt site) which is fully compatable with LinkIt Smart board.</p><p>Please some one help me to fix the issue as I like to work with only LinkIt Smart as because of price and performance. LinkIt Smart is the only board having 32Mb flash &amp; 128Mb RAM for just USD 13 a have found.<br />Please please please fix the issed and make LinkIt Smart highly popular.</p><p>Thanks &amp; regard</p><p>/jags</p>									</div>

					<p>Though I am late but finally I build linkit firmware from the source github.com/widora/openwrt_widora instead of openwrt official source (git clone git://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git)<br />Now my linkit board detecting USB 2.0 high speed device and now mjpg-streamer &amp; USB audio working simultaneously.</p><p>So I think there is some issue with Openwrt source of CC &amp; trunk both related USB, this is why USB 2.0 device is getting detected as 1.1 full speed instead of High speed.</p><p>In this connection developers team are requested to loom in this matter if they really wants to fixed it.</p><p>/jags</p>									</div>
