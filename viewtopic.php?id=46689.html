					<p>Hi,</p><p>is there a reason why trunk/target/linux/lantiq/dts/ARV752DPW22.dts defines the kernel and firmware partition to start at 0x40000 while it is 0x20000 for ARV752DPW (and almost all others I guess)?<br />The OEM firmware stores configuration at 0x20000 on both routers, but this can (and should) be backed up by the user. AFAIK nothing in there is needed for OpenWrt. So why waste the space and not keep the images more similar?</p>									</div>

					<p>For erase block sizes of 64 kiB, current version of U-Boot fits in three blocks and U-Boot environment requires a separate fourth block. Together this makes 256 kiB (0x40000). Only the last &quot;boot params&quot; partition is needed by OpenWrt. It houses the MAC address and WLAN EEPROM. The &quot;configuration&quot; partition is not needed.</p>									</div>
