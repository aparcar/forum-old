					<p>I set up a henet tunnel on my router running 10.03.1 rc5. now I get a problem.</p><p>Since my wan connection is pppoe so the ip is dynamic, it needs 90-6in4 in hotplug to update its ip. During boot, 6in4 interface would be up a couple of times.<br />But now I need write a hotplug script after tunnel is *REALLY* up, means that after ip is updated, I cannot judge which is the right one.</p><br /><p>Actually the network state: network.henet.up=1 cannot be relied to judge, for static tunnel it is true, but not for dynamic tunnel</p><p>have you guys some better way?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>As the tunnel may need to be refreshed / upped for several reason, I am not sure if there is any magic way to say that &quot;this was the final time, now it is permanently up&quot;.</p><p>Maybe having your hotplug script to check the ipv6 reachbility / ping against some site? If IPv6 traffic works, then you can run the remaing part of the script. Name it to something like 95-6in4 hotplug, so that it runs last with an ifup process.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Aug 2011, 12:50)</p>
