					<p>I have TP-Link <strong>TL-WR841N V8.4</strong> Router whose WAN Port is not functional. I need to configure one of the LAN port as WAN port so that I can connect to PPPoE connection. I have OpenWRT installed on my router and have tried various methods but unfortunately nothing worked. I need a working solution by which I can directly change settings through web interface of the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hitesh.Kirtane</strong> on 27 Oct 2017, 19:02)</p>

					<p>First, be logged into the router via wifi so if you mess up the ethernet port configuration you can still log in.</p><p>Go to the switch page and set up two VLANs.&nbsp; One (number it VLAN 1) has three of the ports untagged, and tagged to the CPU.&nbsp; The other (make it VLAN 2) has the port you want to use for WAN untagged, and tagged to the CPU.&nbsp; The cable ports need to be untagged in one VLAN and off in the other.&nbsp; The CPU needs to be tagged in both.&nbsp; &nbsp;Note that the cable port numbers are mixed up compared to how they are marked on the box.&nbsp; You can plug and unplug a live cable and watch the status icons to see which one is which.</p><p>Then go to the network - wan - physical settings and disconnect eth0 (the non-working original WAN port, which is wired directly to the CPU) and connect eth1.2 (VLAN 2 of eth1) instead.&nbsp; Change the LAN physical port from eth1 to eth1.1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing should be connected to plain eth1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. It worked perfectly. I need one more help. My ISP has registered my Internet Connection with different MAC address. Now I want to use the MAC Clone feature. Everytime I log on the router I need to turn on SSH Command Line Client and use the following commands in order to get the connection link up.<br />ifconfig eth1.2 down<br />ifconfig eth1.2 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX<br />ifconfig eth1.2 up<br />Someone suggested me to create a clonemac script and put it to the OpenWRT startup. I don&#039;t have any idea about creating and editing these init scripts.<br />Please suggest me some solution for this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the solution. I tried your solution, it worked fine for DHCP Connections but didn&#039;t worked for PPPoE connections. What I did is just placed the above code in the clonemac script and placed it to the startup which solved my problem.<br />Here is the script.</p><p>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common<br /># Copyright (C) 2014 OpenWrt.org</p><p>START=94<br />STOP=15</p><p>start() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ifconfig eth1 down<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ifconfig eth1 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ifconfig eth1 up<br />}</p><p>stop() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo &quot;Stop.&quot;<br />}</p><p>Hope this helps to others too.</p>									</div>
