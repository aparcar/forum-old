					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wanted to run an openvpn-client over 3G on a TL-MR3420.<br />So I flashed my TL-MR 3420 wirh trunk. That worked fine.<br />But then I found that there is not enough space for 3gdongle and openvpn,<br />so I tried to install extroot, but there was even not enough space to install the necessary usb-storage<br />packets.<br />So I thought, well that is not going to work and decided to go back to the original<br />firmware. Everything seemd to work out fine. I could logg into the original TP-Link Webinterface as bevore.<br />But then, when I setup the 3G-connection, I get strange windows, asking if I want to change the password for root???<br />If I say Yes or Abort: The 3g-setup doesn&#039;t work anymore.<br />And the 3g-connection (that was fine bevore I started with OpneWrt) is not working.<br />Besides that the Web-Interface seems to run normal. I tried to set it back to factory parameters<br />and I did reboot. But no success.</p><p>Could anybody tell me, where there are changes left from openwrt, which I have to revert.<br />And how I do this???</p><p>Many thanxs!!<br />HUHU</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the hint, Orca, <br />but to the level of my knowledge the info there is not what I need.<br />The strange thing is, that the original firmware seems to work properly. The original<br />web-Interface works fine. Just in the 3G-part there seem to be remains from my<br />flashing openwrt on the device and I don&#039;t know, how to get rid of this.</p><p>With other words: Is there a way to fully put the device back to fresh from factory?</p><p>I realy appreciate any comments!!</p><p>HUHU</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks again Orca,</p><p>if I understand the info right, only the part &quot;firmware&quot; in &quot;layer 1&quot; is been flashed. &quot;u-boot&quot; and &quot;art&quot; <br />are kept, right? Well, than maybe there were changes made there, that I have to get rid of.<br />From my words you certainly can tell, that I have little knowledge of this topic.<br />Nevertheless with the great openwrt-project, even I was able to flash and play around.<br />Now I need to get back, because what I planed didn&#039;t work out....</p><p>Any comments on how to?</p><p>I don&#039;t think its the browser cache, because I tested different browsers. Nevertheless I&#039;ll type your suggestions.</p><p>Thanks,<br />HUHU</p>									</div>
