					<p>Context: in order to block all ad&#039;s from known ad servers, I have a special crafted dnsmasq config file that redirects all ad servers to a new instance of uhttpd on the router. This is working all right but I would like to serve a one pixel image to all requested url&#039;s. This would avoid uhttpd sending back a&nbsp; 404. Is there any way to get uhttpd to rewrite all url&#039;s?</p>									</div>

					<p>As mentioned above, I am using dnsmasq to block ad servers. So, if the web page you are viewing has an embedded ad pointing to, for example, adnet.biz my dnsmasq blackist will resolve to one of the router interface (i.e. 192.168.10.200). Problem is that if I use uhttp to that purpose, the embedded ad link will then search for <strong>192.168.10.200/any_dir/some-url.html</strong> and uhttp will return a 404 as it doesn&#039;t have that file in it&#039;s doc root directory. Consequently, the web page you are viewing will display a 404 message where the ad should have been. Not exactly better than displaying the ad. Hence my request for url rewriting so that uhttp could serve a empty page to *any* http request.</p><p>As I couldn&#039;t find any reference to the possibility for uhttp to do that I found a work around with Lua. The idea is to setup a fake server. As these are my very first snippet in lua, could a lua expert review it and comment if there is any room for improvement/fix?</p><p>Prerequisite: lua&#039;s socket library luasocket</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/lua
-- load namespace
local socket = require(&quot;socket&quot;)

-- config variables
local host = &quot;192.168.10.200&quot;
local port = 80

-- create a TCP socket and bind it to the host and port
local server = assert(socket.bind(host, port))

local ip, port = server:getsockname()
-- print a message informing what&#039;s up
print(&quot;Fake server listening on &quot; .. host .. &quot;:&quot; .. port)

-- loop forever waiting for clients
while 1 do
    -- wait for a connection from any client
    local client = server:accept()

    -- make sure we don&#039;t block waiting for this client&#039;s line
        client:settimeout(10)

    -- receive any http request from client
    local line, err = client:receive()

    -- if there was no error, send an empty page back to the client
    if not err then client:send(&quot; &quot;) end

    -- done with client, close the object
    client:close()
end</code></pre></div><p>Ref:<br /><a href="http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/introduction.html">http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luaso â€¦ ction.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ripat</strong> on 23 Jul 2010, 19:38)</p>
