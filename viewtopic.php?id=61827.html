					<p>Hello! 1st post here, be gentle. </p><p>I was wondering how I would go about changing the WAN port on my GL-AR150 to a LAN port. </p><p>I did some searches and googled a bit, saw a few references but am still unsure what to do. </p><p>Proposed Setup:</p><p>2 x raspberry pi&#039;s connected to the GL-AS150 via Ethernet. GL-AS150 acting as a wireless bridge back to a router that is supplying the internet connection. </p><p>Let me know if any additional details are needed to answer this question. </p><p>Any assistance is greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>This should be fairly straightforward to do.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need to do the pseudo-bridge stuff in the client wireless wiki pages as well as re-assigning the WAN port back to the LAN VLAN.</p><p>All of this should be available from Luci but since there is only trunk snapshots available you&#039;ll either need to install Luci after flashing or build an image with Luci embedded.</p>									</div>
