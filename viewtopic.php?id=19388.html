					<p>Hi,</p><p>my system had some happily drifting clock (no crystal oscillator),<br />so I created some alternative script for ntpclient which solely uses <br />the -s option to set the clock.</p><p>Its an init.d script, and picks a random server from /etc/config/ntpclient<br />on startup. It then sets up cron which calls ntpclient -s frequently. <br />In case of connection failure it picks up another ntp server and continues.<br />Configuration is compatible to luci-app-ntpc.</p><p>You may find it at <a href="http://katerkamp.de/software/ntpclient/">http://katerkamp.de/software/ntpclient/</a> .</p><p>There is also a tarball for OpenWrt buildroot available, this will create<br />a package called ntpclient-noxtal.</p><p>Let me know if you find it useful.</p><p>Have fun,<br />Stefan</p>									</div>

					<p>I decided to install your alternative ntpclient script instead of the standard one, since it fits better into my set-up (the router is not always connected to the Internet, specially at the start). Another reason (perhaps the main one) was to get started on compiling packages and developing for the openwrt platform: your package has been very helpful for both purposes!</p><p>If someone is interested, I can provide the ipkg package compiled for <em>brcm-2.4</em> on Kamikaze 8.09.1. In any case, thanks for the effort.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>diego.misc</strong> on 2 Nov 2009, 19:01)</p>
