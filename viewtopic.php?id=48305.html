					<p>Hello! After sorting out my home networking cabinet, I power cycled one of my WDR3600s and then it stopped booting OpenWrt, instead flashing all the LEDs every two seconds or so.</p><p>I soldered a 4 pin header, found a USB to serial RS-232 cable with a QinHeng Electronics HL-340 as reported by lsusb, and plugged it into a RS232 to serial TTL cable.</p><p>I tried to connect with minicom at 115200 8N1 no flow control, but everything always shows up as garbage characters. What might I have done wrong?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>zhongfu wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>USB to serial RS-232 cable</p></blockquote></div><p> You need low-voltage 3V UART cable, not a &quot;real&quot; (high-voltage, bipolar) RS232. They&#039;re same at protocol logic, but it&#039;s about voltage levels. CPU talks plain 3V logic-level UART, it using 0V as logical zero and about 3V as logical one. Real RS232 uses bipolar voltages of +/-3 ... 12V. Needless to say, idea to put 12V signals at 3V CPU pins can burn CPU to the hell in worst case. This interface is NOT FOOL PROOF. It&#039;s internal/debugging thing for those who knows what they&#039;re doing. So check pinout and voltages TWICE before turning it on. Else you can PERMANENTLY destroy CPU in fatal way. As rule of thumb, when you deal with standard digital I/O pads it&#039;s really invalid idea to put voltages below ground plane level (aka 0V) or above of I/O power supply rail level (3.3V in case of most routers, but you better to check this twice, too).</p><p>And if you&#039;re 100% sure&nbsp; that voltage level and pinout is correct, but there is still some garbage, check baud rate settings, stop bits and parity settings. Rather common setting is 115200 bps, 8-N-1 (8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). But it can vary and not set in stone. Messing these settings isn&#039;t anyhow fatal - it just warrants some funny garbage if settings of sender and receiver do not match.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>t3st3r</strong> on 9 Jan 2014, 01:06)</p>

					<p>Thanks a lot, I will check again when back home. This was a SamKnows router, and they did tell me to throw it away after I asked for a replacement so I figured I could give it a try.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh crap, I just measured the voltage for the rx and tx pins, and my multimeter says 5V. Going to get another one, see if it&#039;s 3.3V and then plug it in... hopefully the stuff isn&#039;t fried</p><p>EDIT: measured the wrong pins (3 and 4 instead of 2 and 3), RX and TX on the serial converter shows 0V. On the new one, it shows 6.6V on pins 2 and 3, and 13V on pins 3 and 4 o.O</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zhongfu</strong> on 9 Jan 2014, 12:31)</p>

					<p>well that does not explain garbage on rx side, usually a 5V ttl &quot;hears&quot; correctly 3.3V ttl.</p><p>have you tried pulling up tx pin of router to 3.3V like it&#039;s necessary in other models? leave rx pin disconnected for now...</p><p><a href="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/4219/20120107193104.jpg">http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/4219 … 193104.jpg</a></p>									</div>
