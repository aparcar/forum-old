					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have a pretty much out of the box setup of openwrt, though I followed the &#039;securing your router guide&#039;, so password set, ssh on different port (so security through obscurity). </p><p>However, I see some odd IP address connected to the WAN interface:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /proc/net/arp<br />IP address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HW type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flags&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HW address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mask&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Device<br />192.168.1.67&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00:00:00:00:00:00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.2<br />192.168.1.115&nbsp; &nbsp; 0x1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00:00:00:00:00:00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.2<br />192.168.1.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00:00:00:00:00:00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.2<br />192.168.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00:1f:90:XX:XX:XX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.2<br />...</p><p>I know 192.168.1.1 is my ISPs router which I connect my OpenWRT router to, but I&#039;m unsure what the others are. Also they have a weird MAC address. Does anyone know what that might be?</p><p>I&#039;m using BARRIER BREAKER (14.07-rc3, r42056)</p><p>Thanks<br />Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rainkinz</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 05:53)</p>
