					<p>Hello, I have just installed kamikazes 7.07 on my wgt634u.<br />The boot is fast and the LAN, SSH , DHCP, DNS and Ipkg are working well.<br />The original firmware was not stable and DHCP was failling almost every day, I hope it will be better with openwrt.</p><p>Now I want to configure a wifi access point. <br />Should I have to install hostapd or is there any configuration to do in /etc/config<br />Are there any other package needed ?<br />There is a great work of documentation but I may have missed some information.<br />Thanks in advance for your help.</p><p>zapo</p>									</div>
