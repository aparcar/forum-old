					<p>Been running a TP-Link AC1750, but I am sick of the dropping wifi connections, and I&#039;m done buying TP-Link because they no longer support open firmware.</p><p>It appears Linksys is a clear choice for supporting open firmware. Can you comment on the current state of the drivers. I have had stellar experience with old TP-Link N750. Is the Linksys going to give similar experience? Is everyone happy with them? Do you recommend purchase or should I stay away?</p><p>Which is more reliable in operation? The WRT1900AC v2 or WRT1900ACS?</p>									</div>

					<p>The only saving grace to Linksys WRT series is the users have a way to get away from OEM buggy FW and use OpenWRT, LEDE or DDWRT. Otherwise I&#039;d recommend going with a different router mfr. Linksys OEM FW development is lacking, buggy and seamless support is very bad. Last ACS update took 6 months and now probably no on track for any more updates as what happened with the v1 and v2. There still bugs in OEM FW that hasn&#039;t been addressed by Linksys and probably won&#039;t be. It&#039;s been a year now and nothing since then for them. It&#039;s a shame that Linksys has fallen so far down the well since they use to be on top. No sure if that was due to Belkin buy or just poor management. </p><p>I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT on my v1 and all is good. I was advised by a forum user I know to migrate to LEDE fork repo as they seem to have more up to date code. Still compatible and similar to OpenWRT. </p><p>Thank you for 3rd party code.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have both V1 and ACS, and both work great for my needs... Wifi has come along way since the beginning, and I consider it to be a little better than stock.</p><p>My V1 is for sale if you are interested.</p>									</div>

					<p>Apart from some clients not getting n or ac speeds wireless is fine, one could argue that some features are missing, thou not essential intel would have implemented them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Make sure to update to the latest driver. Apart from that the hardware is well supported by linux.</p><p>About not needing the performance, the v1 didn&#039;t made the cut for me so I waited patiently for the acs. Getting the cpu to 100% is as easy as downloading at Gbit speed (nat) and there are many other creative ways to max it out.</p><p>If the open support for thirdparty firmware carries value for you go for it. For me the looks and hacker friendliness are other valuable aspects.</p>									</div>

					<p>A couple of you have mentioned LEDE. </p><p>It appears they do not have a formal #1 release available. Are the images available now stable? Is there any reliability hit by switching to LEDE over OpenWRT considering LEDE has not made a formal release?</p><p>Is there the ability to install dnscrypt (for example) like can be done with OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>There isn&#039;t a reliability hit by going to lede. I&#039;ve been running it since the 10th of June, and no crashes or freezing. However, due to hardware inconsistencies, you&#039;re experiences may differ.</p>									</div>
