					<p>Hi All, </p><p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR841ND with OpenWRT 15.05.1, <br />I would like to achieve a hub mode between two RJ45 ports,<br />I would like to analyze a device traffic on one of the RJ45 port with PC with Wireshark on a different RJ45 port... like on a hub without redirecting/affecting the traffic.<br />How can I achieve this please ?</p><p>Thank you very much</p>									</div>

					<p>I have tried mod_tee,</p><p>but somehow the packets cloning is not working for me,<br />installed the tee with :<br />opkg install iptables-mod-tee</p><p>the module is loaded,<br />but when I try to add rules like :</p><p>iptables -A POSTROUTING -t mangle -o br-lan ! -s 192.168.1.120 -j TEE --gateway 192.168.1.150<br />or<br />iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -i br-lan ! -d 192.168.9.120 -j TEE --gateway 192.168.9.150</p><p>nothing happen, <br />strange is that I cannot list the POSTROUTING nor PREROUTING chain,</p><p>Do you know what can be the problem ?</p>									</div>

					<p>By default, traffic between ports on the LAN connections goes through a switch external to the CPU, and thus you will not see any traffic in OpenWrt; there is no INPUT, OUTPUT, or ROUTING on that traffic. I would try to set up each port on a different VLAN, then mix them together using a bridge; this way, traffic should flow thorough the CPU.</p><p>Have a look at wireshark&#039;s wiki for more info: <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/Ethernet">https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/Ethernet</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Like eduperez said, first you will have to defeat the hardware switching by making separate VLANs which will force all traffic on each port to go through the CPU, and then use the software bridge in the kernel to connect them back together.&nbsp; </p><p> If you just plug two cables into the ports on the same VLAN the hardware switch will take care of traffic between two external devices, and the CPU will never see any of the packets, so it cannot monitor or redirect them.&nbsp; In the standard use case that is good, because speed is higher.</p>									</div>
