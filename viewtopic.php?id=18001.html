					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a LinkSys WRT54GL router on which I installed DD-WRT. Unfortunately the webinterface of DD-WRT doesn&#039;t allow me to configure advanced stuff like a transparent bridging firewall. As the main focus of DD-WRT seems to be a router which is configured with the web interface with no manual intervention, I would like to switch to OpenWRT and configure everything manually without a web interface.</p><p>Before reflashing however, I have some questions:</p><p>- Which version of OpenWRT should I use (White Russion / Kamikaze)?</p><p>- Is it possible to flash OpenWRT by using the webinterface of DD-WRT (problems with config leftovers?)? After flashing DD-WRT I had to press the reset button to reset to default configuration and kill any config leftovers from the origingal firmware. Do I have to do this with OpenWRT, too?</p><p>- Is it possible to get rid of the Kamikaze Webinterface? I&#039;m a bit worried that my manual configuration gets overwritten if someone happens to use the webinterface.</p><p>Temar</p>									</div>

					<p>Kamikaze</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; Just follow instructions.&nbsp; Telnet in to set root password and off you go. RESET switch is for NVRAM cruft which Kamikaze ignores so this is unneccessary in Kamikaze.</p><p>Yes, /etc/init.d/httpd disable</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 10 Dec 2008, 07:33)</p>
