					<p>I am a new openwrt user for rt-n16 as well. Thanks everyone for the great work. I just want to post some of my experience regarding the wireless network config, hopefully it will help.</p><p>To be specifc: I flashed my rt-n16 router from tomatousb to <a href="http://openwrt.razvi.ro/barrier_braker_asus_rt-n16_svn_r35893/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">http://openwrt.razvi.ro/barrier_braker_asus_rt-n16_svn_r35893/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx</a></p><p>After some basic configuration, everything was up and running. Although the Luci config page shows only 802.11bg mode, it did connect at 802.11n speed for me. However it was only at 150mbps. </p><p>I did some research, finally enabled 40mhz channel width, and got it working at 300mbps. I had to do:</p><p>wlc down<br/>wl -i wl0 chanspec 6l ( set to channel 6l for example )<br/>wlc up</p><p>You can type &#039;wl -i wl0 chanspecs&#039; to see all available channels, 40mhz width ones are 1l, 2l, 3l, ... , 5u, 6u 7u etc.</p><p>I am not sure if there is a way to do this cleanly through uci. If someone knows how to do that, please post. I ended up putting the above commands in the &quot;custom startup&quot; section using Luci.</p><p>BTW to get 300mbps, you have to use WPA2 PSK encryption, and the laptop (client) need to support that.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am still on BB 35318 on my RT-N16. I have posted before that my Guest WIFI goes walkies after a few days. It all looks fine in the GUI but no scanner can see the second network or sign onto it. Nobody has offered any ideas so far.</p><p>Yesterday I needed to get into my modem downstream of the Asus. Could not connect. Looked in my logs, I get the line stats out of the modem every five minutes, and it had stopped working about 24 hours previously. Bounced the modem - no change. Ran traceroute to the modem to see that the first hop was my ISP! Rebooted the Asus and now I can talk to the modem again *and* the guest WIFI is back. The router had been up for over 60 days. Looks to me if something fills up and silently stops working. Because the SNAT rule to allow the LAN to get to the modem never got entered&nbsp; whilst I was trying to get to the modem - ie it&#039;s counter never increased.&nbsp; The guest WIFI usually stops being visible after a few days.</p>									</div>
