					<p>Hey,</p><p>I successful brought OpenWRT to my Easybox 602 (by <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw</a> and <a href="http://lab.ks.uni-freiburg.de/projects/linux_from_scratch/wiki/EasyBox_flashen">http://lab.ks.uni-freiburg.de/projects/ … ox_flashen</a>) with the hope I could then use the USB port for soemthing else than just an UMTS stick. But OpenWRT doesnt seem to find my USB drive as well. So now I want to restore the stock firmware but I cant find anything about that. I just found a lot about backing stuff up bot not restoring it.</p><p>I have my firmware dumps laying around (yeah 3 of then as suggested in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw#backup)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw#backup)</a> but&nbsp; have no idea how to write then back to the flash. Uboot and OpenWRT are up and running so any help is hightly appreciated!</p><p>Best wishes</p><p>zivimo</p>									</div>

					<p>That router is listed on the &quot;work in progress&quot; section, so there is probably no full support and not many users... </p><p>Just a pure guess, but probably the recovery process described at that Wiki article is still valid. It sounds like the OEM manufacturer&#039;s recovery process, with which you could flash the original firmware<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/arv752dpw#flash.to.openwrt.without.opening.the.device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/ar … the.device</a></p>									</div>
