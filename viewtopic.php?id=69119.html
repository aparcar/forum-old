					<p>I&#039;ve been having a weird problem in the last months that I constantly failed to fix.</p><p>Navigating on <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a>, wiki.openwrt.org, dev.openwrt.org, forum.openwrt.org was causing pppoe to random disconnect. It was relative easy to reproduce cause trying to load an ***.openwrt.org was causing this problems somewhere in the first 30 tries (windows or linux it was the same, this ruled out a possible pc OS problem). Log didn&#039;t helped, all that was there was it didn&#039;t received an answer to last 5 echo packets. Changing the number of echo packets didn&#039;t helped at all, it only took more for pppoe to detect the link drop and attempt to reconnect.<br />The problem was with bb 14.07 from openwrt, latest 14.07 self compiled, 15.05.1 from openwrt, latest 15.05.1 self compiled so this kinda removed a possible self compile issue (it was happening with lede also but it looks like lede has some problems bringing up wan after pppoe loses connection).<br />Staying away from ***.openwrt.org kept pppoe active for 20+ days. After those 20 days the first attempt to connect to ***.openwrt.org triggered the pppoe disconnect.<br />Tests were done when only my pc was connected to the router, when there were 3 pc connected to the router, with another pc and it was always the same: pppoe random dc when i try to access ***.openwrt.org .</p><p>What looks to have fix it is disabling sysntp. After disabling sysntp I failed to reproduce the random pppoe disconnect.</p><p>So my question is if sysntp can make pppoe disconnect and if yes why? I ask because it doesn&#039;t really make sense to me...</p><p>Log only show 1 single time change and that&#039;s after pppoe connects. That timechange is making the router lose the ipv6 but it gets a new one back (ipv6 is received via dhcp6). There is no other time change reported after the first one. I tought at some point that maybe it was resyncing the time, adding 5+ seconds and due to the missing 5+ seconds (for the router those 5+ seconds don&#039;t actually exist) pppoe was thinking that the last 5 echo packets are lost but there is no timechange in the log to support this idea, also changing from 5 echo packets to 120 still didn&#039;t fixed the problem.</p><p>Sysntp looks to kinda spam connection to ntp servers. Basicaly in router connections tab I constatly saw 1-3 connection on port 123 initiated by the router. I don&#039;t really see the point to check/try to resync the time every 1-5 minute, maybe 1 time every 12-24 hours but not every couple of minutes.<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system</a> doesn&#039;t show any way to change how often ntp client check the time... I kinda think that the ntp wiki section is outdated.</p><p>Is it possible that my ISP consider that the often traffic done on port 123 by sysntp is some sort of trojan and it disconnect me due to that? <a href="http://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=123">http://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=123</a> has 1 trojan listed on port 123.<br />But this doesn&#039;t explain why only when I navigated on ***.openwrt.org pppoe was random disconnecting. I fail to reproduce it with other addresses.</p><p>I really doubt the traffic done by sysntp on ***.openwrt.pool.ntp.org by sysntp can be considered as flood because there is not much traffic.</p><p>L.E.: Forgot to mention that if I use OpenWRT on a pc setup as router I can&#039;t replicate this problem. This makes it even more crazy...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thedukesd</strong> on 27 Dec 2016, 21:41)</p>
