					<p>The new config system doesn&#039;t appear to provide me with the MAC Address (BSSID) of my WRT54GL radio -- it&#039;s not defined in /etc/config/wireless.&nbsp; With WhiteRussian I could always use &quot;nvram get il0macaddr&quot;.</p><p>What is the official method of determining this value with Kamikaze?&nbsp; (I could parse &quot;ifconfig wl0&quot;, or &quot;cat /proc/net/wl0&quot; but those methods feel too fuzzy.)</p><p>I am converting over from WhiteRussian and its going quite well.&nbsp; Other than adjusting my init scripts, the only other change so far is redoing some scripts that used to interact with nvram.&nbsp; Hence my question.</p><p>Thanks OpenWRT team for all your fine efforts.</p><p>Bill</p>									</div>
