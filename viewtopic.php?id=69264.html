					<p>Hello all, long time reader, first time poster <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>I am trying to get OpenWRT running on the Mikrotik SXT Lite2.</p><p>I have tried booting various precompiled ramdisk images, with no luck. I disassembled it, and have soldered wires to the UART terminals.</p><p>Viewing the serial port while booting openwrt ramdisk, I notice that the board is identified as 911, instead of 82. Unable to find out why this occurs, I edited the source code of mips_machine.c and forced identification as sxt2n (82).</p><p>During boot, I can see that the forced identification works correctly, and the system boots. I am unable to access the device over ethernet, device does not respond on 192.168.1.1, and wireshark shows no activity from the devices MAC address (and wifi is also inactive).</p><p>Has anyone had any success? Can someone point me in the right direction?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Just an update, in case anyone else is interested:</p><p>My Mikrotik SXT Lite2 is the r3 version, so I assume it gives out a different identification.</p><p>I managed to compile a kernel that loads an ash shell which I am able to use over UART. Neither Ethernet or WLAN function (via ifconfig).</p><p>Still reading up on the driver structure.</p><p>If anyone has any info (or tips) they would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>I am not quitting till this thing boots openWRT successfuly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey @augustus_meyer!</p><p>Looked on the forum. No dice for this router.</p><p>I have decided to go the long way around; I found a datasheet for the AR94xx that my router uses and will write drivers and modules for it. This may take a while. But, after taking so much from the (open-source) community in general, I think I should work and give something back.</p><p>If anyone is interested (Especially if they have the r2 board, but also the r3) watch this space and I will notify when I have something ready for testing.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Can anyone confirm, once you have a shell to openwrt that ifconfig (or ip links) shows the ethernet/wifi adaptors? Does OpenWrt use some other method of controlling the network devices besides linux network-type drivers?</p>									</div>
