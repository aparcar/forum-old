					<p>Hey,</p><p>I am using OpenWRT as a Firewall and router for a development virtual environment.<br />I have used VyOS and customized Routers which I composed from CentOS,Ubuntu,Debian and couple others,<br />however, OpenWRT feels nicer to me since it has a nice gui.<br />And I was wondering about FastPath implementation for VM&#039;s.<br />The reason I was wondering about it is a post in the mailing list of openwrt that mentioned a FastPath software implementation that might be published for the opensource community.<br />Was it implemented and published in OpenWRT? if no, are there any plans?</p>									</div>

					<p>Have a look over at the Lede forum. It&#039;s actively discussed and cleaned up. I am not using any x86 based router devices but it should compile just fine.</p><p>forum.lede-project.org/t/qualcomm-fast-path-for-lede/4582/359</p>									</div>
