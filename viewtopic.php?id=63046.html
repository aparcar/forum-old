					<p>Ubiquiti Nanostation M2 flashed with the custom firmware can add and make changes but when I reboot it wont copy NVram and the log comes back with errors. I assume either there is a bug in relation to copying settings across to startup or I don&#039;t have enough memory to save changes I have made. Im sure there is a fix already for this someone could help me out would be great. I really would like to be able to have a guest network and 2 private wlan networks running off the one device otherwise I&#039;m looking at replacing 500+ units with another brand in order to achieve my end state.</p><p>Thanks in Advance</p>									</div>
