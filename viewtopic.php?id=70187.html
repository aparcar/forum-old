					<p>There is also other &quot;back to stock&quot; procedure which <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=287813">does not require USB to TTL cable</a>.</p><p>In short words:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Booting back to stock from other patition 
When you install DD-WRT over stock, it installs on a different partition. You can use the following command by entering it in DDWRT commands on the administration tab, Telnet or SSH to determine what partition DD-WRT is running on. 
Code:
ubootenv get boot_part 

The last number it returns is the partition (it will return 1 or 2). In my case, DD-WRT is on partition 1, so to return to Stock, enter (If yours returns 2, put 1): 
Code:
ubootenv set boot_part 2

and then reboot. You can use the command 
Code:
reboot</code></pre></div><p>It means that every time We install firmware it will be installed on non active partition. So every time before flashing we will active stock firmware partition and flash with FACTORY-to-costume_firmware We will have OEM backup firmware. Do I think correctly?</p>									</div>

					<p>You are thinking correctly. If you first switch from Openwrt/LEDE partition to the OEM firmware and then flash from there, the OEM parition remain intact and you always replace the Openwrt/LEDE image.</p><p>But you might look more carefully at the command for the partition switching. You might need to set also another uboot env variable &quot;bootcmd&quot; in addition to &quot;boot_part&quot;. See discussion and examples at:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=353492#p353492">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 92#p353492</a></p><p>Ps.

					<p>Not quite sure. But you can see from the source code links in the other thread that both Openwrt and LEDE set both variables when they switch partition connection with sysupgrade. So I have followed that practice myself.</p>									</div>

Yes, there are some device-specifc PRs being made in Openwrt but seems that nobody merges them in any more. Pretending that Openwrt is alive and well does not help anybody.</p><p>With current LEDE master, kernel 4.9 is the default for WRT3200ACM and pretty much everything works. <br />(well, CPU frequency scaling is still absent, as well as wifi LEDs, but that concerns all builds, I think.)</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>silelis wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>From my point of view the most importent are:<br />- stable wifi<br />- openVPN server<br />- usb /overlay<br />- dyndns</p></blockquote></div><p>Wifi driver is the same in all trunk/master builds, so there is no difference. And all other items are just packages that you can include in your own build.</p><p>In general, the answer to the question of the best firmware is always &quot;your own&quot;. You can include just the packages that you want and can tweak the defaults to your liking etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 15 Mar 2017, 13:44)</p>
