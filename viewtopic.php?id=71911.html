					<p>I just recently flashed my Cisco Meraki MR18 AP, but I&#039;m having some weird networking issues when I have it connected. I am getting DNS errors when I connect to that network, which I believe are being caused by my raspberry pi running a Pi-Hole DNS and DHCP server. The system works perfectly wirelessly and wired when the Meraki isn&#039;t connected, but when I wire it in, I can only use the wired internet (it appears to even cause my other wifi SSIDs to begin getting DNS errors. The pi-hole is wired directly to the router, as is the AP. So I basically have 2 questions:</p><p>1) How the heck to I find the IP address of the MR18? Currently I can only get into LEDE when I wire directly to it. When I look at my router, I do not see the MAC or the name of the AP anywhere as a connected device, and same for the pi-hole DHCP lease section. I should note that I was never able to find it in either of these before, but I believe I&#039;m supposed to be able to.<br />2) What could be causing the DNS errors when the Meraki is connected?</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting thought. I didn&#039;t check. I suppose I assumed that since it was in AP mode, it wouldn&#039;t be trying to act as a DHCP server. I definitely didn&#039;t personally set it as a DHCP server. I can&#039;t check at the moment, but I&#039;ll check tomorrow.</p>									</div>

					<p>Perfect. Had to browse around a bit, but ultimately found Network -&gt; Interfaces -&gt; Edit, and changed the protocol from Static to DHCP client, and now it&#039;s getting an IP address from the Pi-Hole and not taking my entire wireless network down haha. Thanks a lot!</p>									</div>
