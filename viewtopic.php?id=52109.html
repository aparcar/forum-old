					<p>Hello,</p><p>is it possible to setup two seperate APs with different IP ranges within the same LAN?</p><p>Background is the following idea: I&#039;d like to have two WLANs: the default one routed through a private VPN service, the fallback one with direct access to internet. Users of both WLANs should see each other, and - most importantly: see the local devices (.e.g. printers) in our private network.</p><p>The idea to use seperate IP ranges for both WLANs is that I could route the traffic for one WLAN through VPN by an ip routing rule that way:</p><p>ip rule add from 192.168.1.192/26 table 10</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Two separate IP ranges is almost the definition of &quot;not the same LAN&quot; however it is possible. Don&#039;t expect it to be easy. In order to enforce such a policy (instead of just hinting it) you would have to set up separate subnets, customized inter-subnet routing, and various broadcast relays.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp</a></p><p>You could create one subnet but different assignment ranges for differen wifis. There&#039;s the &quot;networkid&quot; for it.</p><p>Use 192.168.1.0/24 as subnet but 192.168.1.128/26 assignment range for WLAN1 and 192.168.1.192/26 assignment range for WLAN2.<br />As long as both get 192.168.1.0/24 as subnet mask every client in this net is equal when it comes to internal-only traffic. That&#039;s especially handy for broadcasting things because you *don&#039;t* need to set up relays or routing. Those clients &quot;just sit on the same wire&quot; like usual.<br />The only difference is: &quot;When connected interace is the first one, use the lower end of the subnet range, when connected interface is the second one, use the upper end of the subnet range&quot;.</p><p>That enables you to assign different routing to the outside world.</p><p>But to be honest: I don&#039;t do that. I have a couple of devices that should route through VPN, but the number is very limited. So I just pinned those MAC addresses to static IPs and created distinct policies. Done. I don&#039;t change my computers or mobile phones wifi interfaces every day <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>[edit]<br />If you want to create connection restrictions between your clients like firewalling everything except DLNA or stuff, things are different. Then you need different networks on OpenWRT side to create different firewall zones. But as long as you want them to be on the very same network to ease up connection and only set up tiny different routing behavior to the outside world you can do it that way quite easily. Assuming &quot;networkid&quot; works, of course.<br />[/edit]</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 19 Aug 2014, 12:09)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the pointers. (Yes, I feel comfortable even with more advanced topics in OpenWrt. But I first tried having the VPN and the respective rules directly on my NAS -- a WD My Book Live which I otherwise love very much. However, it turned out to be hard to near impossible since their (Debian-based) system was compiled without ip rule support. And unwilling to compile my own firmware for the NAS, I reluctantly gave up on it and never touched the topic since.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your comments. So if I got it right, then it&#039;s (next to) impossible to do what I intended and what golialive suggested. So what else do you recommend to get the following result:</p><p>-&gt; to seperate APs, one being routed through VPN, one with direct access to internet<br />-&gt; local network devices (printers, ...) accessible from both APs</p><p>I guess that I would need to use manual routing for every single network device to make it accessible within the second LAN (i.e. the VPN-routed AP), right?</p>									</div>
