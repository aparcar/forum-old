					<p>Hey folks, I am using OpenWrt on a RaspberryPi (GoldenOrb from ofmodemsandmen, shouldn&#039;t make a difference) to be able to get a 4G connection (QMI). Since I only use mobile broadband as a backup I want my beefy core Firewall (pfSense with tons of rules vpns and stuff) to receive the Provider-IP by DHCP.</p><p>Right now the box is running as a Router, my 4G Interface looks like this:<br />config interface &#039;wwan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;wwan0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</p><p><strong>How can I bridge wwan0 to eth0 VLAN 2 (and don&#039;t pull an IP from the stick) and have the configuration interface on eth0 VLAN 1 ?</strong></p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
