					<p>In the rules do I need to create one with source host-&gt;IP and destination host-&gt;ALL and one inverted, or I can use only 1 rule with both destination and source host pointing to the lan IP? How does the logic work?</p><p>Also how do the sets and overrides work? I mean If I have a broad rule that catches all the traffic from an IP, but I have another rule that lower the priority of a port for all IPs, what priority will have the traffic coming from the high priority IP&nbsp; but through the low priority port?</p>									</div>
