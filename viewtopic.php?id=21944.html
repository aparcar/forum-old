Card support is in the usbserial and usbnet drivers (option, sierra, hso) and newer or older kernels have newer or older versions of these drivers.</p><br /><p>Though regardless of the kernel version, you&#039;re still looking at upwards of 100 devices between option, sierra, and hso.</p><br /><p>The HSO driver is in drivers--&gt;usb--&gt;net. It creates /dev/ttyHSX devices instead of /dev/ttyUSBX devices, and Option provides its own shell script for connecting the cards, name hso_connect.sh which is provided with the driver.</p><br /><br /><p>Like I had suggested before, read the information provided in the link I sent you. It has all of the information you are looking for.</p>									</div>
