					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have just come across this project, and after some browsing through your docs and forum,<br />it seems that OpenWrt might allow me to do what I want.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what it is:</p><p>a) My ADSL modem is a Thompson Speedtouch, connected via USB.&nbsp; I want the connection<br />to be available wirelessly anywhere in the house without forcing one computer to be always<br />on connected to the modem.</p><p>b) I have an external USB harddisk which I also want to share wirelessly.</p><p>Now, obviously I need a wireless router with a USB port. The Asus WL-500G Deluxe has<br />been discontinued, but I can still get the Premium version.&nbsp; Your TableOfHardware says<br />that the Premium is compatible (with some modifications), and judging from some of<br />the messages in this forum, the ADSL sharing should also be possible.&nbsp; However, before<br />I commit the +€100 to buy this thing, i wanna be *sure* it will work.</p><p>So, my question is: do you recommend the Asus W-500G Premium after all?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!<br />Cheers,<br />Jean</p>									</div>

I found the solution I used at http://artekw.suwalki.kom.pl/wiki/doku.php?id=software%3Aneostrada . Unfortunately this site is in Polish, but anyway still you can figure out what it is about :) I don&#039;t have to much free time today, so I can&#039;t translate all that stuff. Anyway below you will find very first draft of my translation - specially for you :). I hope it somehow will help you. If you&#039;ll have any questions do not hesitate to ask.

Regards,
Adam Niko Niklaus

First of all we need to configure and install USB staff:
ipkg install kmod-usb-core
ipkg install kmod-usb-uhci # for routers other than WL-500gP, can be necessary to install OHCI
ipkg install kmod-usb-usb2 # not required for SpeedTouch330 (USB v1.1)

We need to installl packages for USB modem (SpeedTouch) and PPP:
ipkg install kmod-usb-acm
ipkg install libgcc
ipkg install kmod-ppp

Next step is mounting file system:
mount -t usbdevfs usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb

Now we can check if our modem is recognized by router. Connect modem to any of USB ports and type in:
# cat /proc/bus/usb/devices

If everything is OK, as result we should receive something like that:
(...)
P: Vendor=06b9 ProdID=4061 Rev= 2.00
S: Manufacturer=ALCATEL
S: Product=Speed Touch 330
(...)

Remember the version of your modem (Rev=X.XX).

You need to place kernel&#039;s modules and programs (ppp_synctty.o, atm.o, n_hdlc.o; (obs³uga ppp): ppp_mppe_mppc.o) in folder: /lib/modules/2.4.30

Rest files (modem&#039;s program): modem_run; (firmware): KQD6_3.012 (for Rev= 2.00), ZZZL_3.012 (Rev= 4.00); and PPP plugin: pppoa3, copy to /usr/local.

You can download missing modules here http://eko.one.pl/openwrt/spdtch-pppoa_2.4.30-brcm_mipsel.tgz and SpeedTouch&#039;s firmware here http://www.speedtouchdsl.com/download/drivers/USB/SpeedTouch330_firmware_3012.zip . Extract them to np.: /tmp and then move to right folders:
cd /tmp
wget http://eko.one.pl/openwrt/spdtch-pppoa_2.4.30-brcm_mipsel.tgz
tar -zxvf spdtch-pppoa_2.4.30-brcm_mipsel.tgz
mv *.o /lib/modules/2.4.30
mkdir -p /usr/local
mv modem_run /usr/local
mv pppoa3 /usr/local

Now load necessary modules:
insmod slhc
insmod ppp_generic
insmod ppp_synctty
insmod ppp_async
insmod ppp_mppe_mppc
insmod atm
insmod n_hdlc

You can download the firmware from  http://www.speedtouchdsl.com/download/drivers/USB/SpeedTouch330_firmware_3012.zip, and then extract two files: KQD6_3.012 and ZZL_3.012. Copy them to /usr/local.

Now we need to load firmware to the modem. So plug in phone line cabel to the modem and type in:
/usr/local/modem_run -v 1 -m -f /usr/local/KQD6_3.012 (If you modem&#039;s version is Rev= 4.00, change in the modem_run firmware&#039;s file name to: ZZZL_3.012 )

During the loading of the firmware, the modem&#039;s lights start blinking. It&#039;s mean that the syncronization proccess began.
You can check if you successfully loaded the firmware by typing:

					<p>I just bought a 500gP for my parents, mainly because of the USB ports which I&#039;ll be connecting a printer and HDD to. I was initially going to install whiterussian on it (been running openwrt on wrt54g(s)&#039;s at home/several other locations for a few years already), but it seems a lot of people are having some kind of rebooting problems with them? On top of that I read on the Wiki that USB 2.0 is broken in whiterussian. If so, I think I&#039;ll stick with the default firmware, as stability is of primary importance in this case..</p>									</div>
