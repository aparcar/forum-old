					<p>I have a TL-WR1043ND I would like to use as a client bridge for my TV, media center etc in my living room (which I want on the same subnet as the rest of my network). This role is currently being done by a WRT54G running some ancient build of DD-WRT, but the speed is terrible. The TL-WR1043ND is currently running stock firmware and serving as an AP for my Routerstation Pro (which I would like to use as 2.4GHz and 5GHz AP at some point in the future, but am not entirely sure how... something I will come back to later on).</p><p>However the problem essentially boils down to me not really knowing what I&#039;m doing. Can this kit run as a client bridge? And can it run at 300Mbps whilst doing so? Is it stable in this configuration? Finally, how do I actually set it up? I roughly know what I&#039;m doing with Linux, the RSPro was easy enough to deploy, but I&#039;ve never really done much using wireless on Linux. I would use dd-wrt, but the community appears to be somewhat less that helpful... and as far as I can tell support for this particular hardware is a little hit and miss, especially when it comes to 300Mbps support.</p><p>I also have the pressing issue that I have an unopened TRENDnet TEW-690AP I have to make a decision on returning by Monday, so if the TL-WR1043ND isn&#039;t going to work out, then I will return it for a Buffalo WLI-TX4-AG300N wireless bridge. </p><p>If you can help me out with this I would be incredibly grateful, especially as I will obviously need to learn more to get the most out of my RSPro</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for that link. Looking at this I don&#039;t think the TP-Link is going to do what I specifically want it to do without a lot of extra work.</p>									</div>
