					<p>Hello everybody!</p><p>We&#039;re 5 people living in an house (3 gamer, everyone has a smartphone, a pc and laptop so ~15-20 devices) our internet plan is 30/6 (up to 100/20 possible). All PCs (5) are connected via Gigabit Ethernet, the other devices via Wi-Fi. The router we are currently (a device from our ISP) using cannot handle it at all, which results in massive lags, permanent reboots, ... Besides I&#039;d like to config more on my router, since my ISP blocked nearly everything on their device. So i decided to buy a new router to get on the one hand a more stable internet experience and on the other a more consumable device. After some lookup I found the TP-Link Archer C7 as the perfect router for using OpenWRT. Fortunatelly the router was on a flash sale for only ~70€ so I decided to get one. So after more lookup I found the Linksys WRT Series which is also very interesting and maybe fits better for my usecase since it has a much stronger CPU, more RAM, more flash and is newer. So now my question would you if you were me better buy a e.g. WRT1200AC (~130€) and send the Archer C7 back or do you think the Archer C7 has enought performance for my usecase?</p><p>Best Regards,<br />paaauls</p>									</div>
