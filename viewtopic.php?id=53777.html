					<p>Hey guys </p><p>So I have this school project where i&#039;m supposed to create a wireless network which can support around 1600 clients and enough throughput for everyone to upload a 1mb picture to a server(on the same network) at the same time. It should cover an area same size as a football field. </p><p>Since the area isn&#039;t that huge, I was thinking a mesh network with no more then 6 ap&#039;s. If less is possible that would be preferred. </p><p>Is there any openwrt capable hardware that can support this load? Would openwrt be able to pull this off or do some of you know a better alternative?</p>									</div>

					<p>No, you dont need controller (until you want to use wpa-enterprise). One dedicated AP (or other router) should work as dhcp, its enough.</p>									</div>
