					<p>Well, im a little confused by how vlans actually work on the typical 5-port wireless routers openwrt is running on..</p><p>i&#039;ve read this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch</a> and much more besides (this was also an insightful link specific to this router <a href="http://www.hermanvandrie.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12:test&amp;catid=4:kpn-glasvezel&amp;Itemid=15)">http://www.hermanvandrie.nl/index.php?o … Itemid=15)</a>. I come from a network (cisco, juniper, etc)/linux background so i understand vlaning quite intimately on both those platforms... but im really struggling to understand how vlan&#039;s work on these little devices...</p><p>If i look at my &quot;play&quot; device (tplink wr1043nd) with swconfig (the web interface really doesnt work for this router, but thats not a surprise - though config in /etc/config/network does), i see something like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>VLAN 0:
    info: VLAN 0: Ports: 
         vid      prio      member      untag      fid
    MC:    0      0      0x003f      0x0000      0

    ports: 0t 1t 2t 3t 4t 5t 
VLAN 1:

         vid      prio      member      untag      fid
    MC:    1      0      0x003f      0x001f      0

    ports: 1 2 3 4 5t 
VLAN 2:
    info: VLAN 2: Ports:

    MC:    0      0      0x0000      0x0000      0
    4K:    0            0x003f      0x001f      0
    ports: 0 5t</code></pre></div><p>I get what vlan 1 and 2 are doing here (i think), for vlan 1 anything coming into ports 1,2,3 + 4 go out port 5 (the internal port to the router) tagged with vlan id 1 (i.e. eth0.1). Same with vlan 2, anything coming into port 0 (wan port) come out eth0.2 (vlan id 2 on eth0 - port 5).</p><p>What i don&#039;t get is what vlan0 is doing, nor how you would deal with connecting the router to another router via a trunking port (i.e. sending multiple vlan tags into the openwrt router, specially when the tags might go higher then 15)?</p><p>The next bit i don&#039;t get is when i read around about how you bridge wan and lan ports, everyone seems to suggest (for my wr1043nd for example) that i should bridge eth0.1 and eth0.2 into br_lan. To me this seems to be a poor choice cause in order for a packet to traverse from the wan to lan ports (i.e. vlan1&lt;-&gt;vlan2 in the switch) it&#039;d have to go all the way up to the linux kernel, thru the cpu, and back out again. Presumably you should be able to just add port 0 to vlan1 and the whole thing just gets handled on the asic in the switch? (which should be much quicker and more efficient). Or have i mis-interpreted how the vlan&#039;ing on the programable switch in the router actually functions?</p><p>update: actually i just realised i had 10.03 rather then 10.03.1-rc5 on this router, i&#039;ve updated it and the switch gui does work and it can go past vlan id&#039;s of 15.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Takigama</strong> on 25 Oct 2011, 12:22)</p>

					<p>You do not understand the docu because it is shit.</p><p>Let me try:<br />1. <br />VLANs are a way to split one switch into MULTIPLE switches That is it. To do this, the switch has to be capable of doing this, a usual Layer2 Switch is not. A, so called, Layer2.5 Switch can do that. And it does that, by marking the packets that income either based on the port they come in (static VLANs) or based on their MACs (dynamic). This information does not leave the switch. You do this, if you happen to have one switch with 24 ports, but you actually require 2 with 12 ports or 3 with ... </p><p>Instead of having one switch (that automatically means one Ethernet segment) you have multiple separate switches! That is it.</p><p>2.<br />And now, if you would want one such a &quot;virtual switch&quot; to span over more then one real switch, you have to communicate that by marking each packet. One method of doing that is described here:<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q</a>&nbsp; There are other methods, like cisco bla bla, but that is irrelevant to us.<br />So you need two Layer 2.5 switches (or better) and configure the VLANs, and then make the information leave on switch and reach the other, so the virtual switches can spawn.</p><p>3.<br />You can also make any Linux physical software interface transmit and receive IEEE802.1Q Frames. You spawn virtual interfaces that look like eth0.x for that.</p><p>Cf: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking/network.interfaces">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/networking/ … interfaces</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection#da.trick.with.the.vlan.trunking">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/inter … n.trunking</a></p><p>Some picture /scheme would be nice to explain this, it&#039;s really simple.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think i perhaps didnt explain myself very well - i get vlans, i know exactly what they do and how they work across ethernet, what 8021q is, etc (networking is what i do for work basically)...

Some similar routers (WNDR3700 for example) really have a separate interface for WAN and port 4 of the switch hanging in the air...so you&#039;d need to know the details of the hardware as opposed to bridging the interfaces which works every time.</p>									</div>
