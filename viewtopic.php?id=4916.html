					<p>Hi guys, here&#039;s what happened with my brand new Asus WL-550 router. </p><p>I uploaded the OpenWrt firmware using Asus firmware restoration utility. The exact name of the image is &quot;openwrt-brcm-2.4-jffs2-4MB.trx&quot;. The upgrade was successful and the router booted afterwards. </p><p>The problem is that I was able to ping the router (192.168.1.1) from my computer but I coudn&#039;t access it using telnet. I rebooted the router again and after this, the bastard didn&#039;t respond to ping anymore. The &quot;funny&quot; thing is that the PWR and AIR led are off, but the other ones are on (WAN, LAN1, LAN2..LAN4). So basically it&#039;s dead :-(</p><p>I pushed the reset button while I powered on the router, but nothing.. Do you guys have any idea how can I get this router to work again ? </p><p>Thanks,<br />Mihnea.</p>									</div>

					<p>According to the hardware table (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a>) the WL-550 is untested hardware with OpenWRT.</p><p>What did you expect?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I know that. Is the WL-550 on the roadmap for the OpenWRT at least ?</p><p>If you can give me a hint on what should I do to bring it back, it will be very much appreciated. Other one than send it back to the vendor :-)</p><p>Thanks,<br />Mihnea.</p>									</div>

					<p>You could try to use the asus firmware tool and hope it will take the firmare at power on time.&nbsp; </p><p>If it is anything like the WL-500 you hold the reset button as you plug it in and it will accept a new firmware via tftp.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if it is on the roadmap.&nbsp; No one has reported how much flash and ram it has, so it obviously hasn&#039;t been looked at much at all.</p>									</div>
