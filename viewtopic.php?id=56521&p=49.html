					<p>I want to propose a couple changes to the ToH.</p><p>1) I think we should change the headings of three columns in the default table. I find it easier to write documentation when the column headings have more natural wording (&quot;Most Recent Release&quot; instead of &quot;Supported Current Rel&quot;)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Supported Current Rel -&gt; Most Recent Release<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Device Page -&gt; Details Page<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Device Techdata -&gt; Technical Data</p><p>2) I have rearranged the topnote to include all the new info that has come into the main ToH. It now fits in a smaller space so that the top rows of the table are visible, even in fairly short windows. See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/playground/reb/toh">http://wiki.openwrt.org/playground/reb/toh</a></p><p>Would this work?</p>									</div>
