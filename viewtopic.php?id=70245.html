					<p><strong>Waza</strong>, thank you kindly for using my script. As I&#039;ve tested it, it is OK, because I remember, that /etc/firewall.user blocks forwarding initially, and after that tunnel works fine, i.e. unblocking rule is executed correctly. Have you edited /etc/firewall.user? How have you tested it, how have you simulated reconnect? In your configuration does <em>tun0</em> exactly correspond to OpenVPN interface? Please, check variable values, insert lines:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo A $ACTION D $DEVICE I $INTERFACE &gt;&gt; /tmp/out.txt
ip a s tun0 up
echo IP $? &gt;&gt; /tmp/out.txt
iptables -C forwarding_rule -j REJECT
echo F $? &gt;&gt; /tmp/out.txt</code></pre></div><p>Bring contents of /tmp/out.txt after loosing and restoring connection. I can explain you the mechanism, it is trivial.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>(ip a s tun0 up)</code></pre></div><p>is valid when return code of command is zero, it just checks, whether tun0 device exists. It doesn&#039;t exist before establishing connection, but in case of loosing I am not sure. You can manually run two subsequent commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip a s tun0 up
echo $?</code></pre></div><p><strong>stangri</strong>, I am afraid, no, because I&#039;ve tested it, so it doesn&#039;t get parameter $INTERFACE in case of down (it is empty).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 17 Mar 2017, 00:22)</p>

					<p><strong>ulmwind</strong>, thank you for providing your work for us. As far as testing goes, I pretty much tested it by just using the connection until it drops. If I have to test something quickly I just kill the VPN connection using empty VPN profile, wait a minute or so and then manually re-enable VPN connection.</p><p><strong>/tmp/out.txt</strong> first when conneciton goes down, then when it goes up.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>A ifdown D I nordvpntun
IP 127
F 0

A ifup D tun0 I nordvpntun
IP 127
F 0</code></pre></div><p>Running <em><strong>ip a s tun0 up</strong></em> in console<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip a s tun0 up
-ash: ip: not found</code></pre></div><p>Once the connection goes down and the switch enables the iptable rule I have to manually run <em><strong>iptables -D forwarding_rule -j REJECT</strong></em> on console to return connectivity. This was a bitch to figure out xD</p><p>EDIT: <strong>firewall.user</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if (! ip a s tun0 up) &amp;&amp; (! iptables -C forwarding_rule -j REJECT); then
        iptables -I forwarding_rule -j REJECT

					<p><strong>Waza</strong>, you can install ip-full as <strong>stangri</strong> wrote. I expected, default firmware config should contain it. You can also replace </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip a s tun0 up</code></pre></div><p> by </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig tun0</code></pre></div><p>I think, to resume connection you run iptables <strong>-D</strong> forwarding_rule -j REJECT (DELETE), not <strong>-C</strong> (CHECK).<br /><strong>stangri</strong>, as you can see, parameter <strong>$DEVICE</strong> turns out to be empty in case of ifdown event. Furthermore initial blocking can&#039;t get such parameters, so, to my mind, my solution is optimal. Of course, it is possible to create specific file for reading and writing such parameters, but it is too complicated without significant improving of attained effect.</p><p>To block and restore connection one can also used scripts for up and down events in OpenVPN connection. But as for initial blocking, I can&#039;t suggest anything else.</p><p>In IPredator manual I&#039;ve seen another option to prevent traffic leakage outside tunnel - to remove permanently masquerade from firewall config for WAN. It is too clumsy, to my mind, however it disables totally NAT LAN-WAN, only NAT LAN-VPN remains.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 17 Mar 2017, 18:56)</p>
