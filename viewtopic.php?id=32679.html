					<p>TL-WR1043ND hardware version 1.7</p><p>I flashed with openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory and successfully set the new login name and password. After adjusting settings I decided to reset to the default settings.</p><p>I could no longer connect thru the web interface. I followed the instructions for entering the failsafe and the SYS LED is blinking fast, but I can&#039;t telnet using PuTTY under Win7. The connection is always refused.</p><p>Are there special setting necessary for using PuTTY ?&nbsp; If not, what should be my next step ?</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; <br />I had changed the IP to 192.168.1.100.&nbsp; Now I can&#039;t ping the router there or to 192.168.1.1</p><p>The unit appears to still be fully operational as a AP (!), but I have no way to log in by either the browser xface or by PuTTY.&nbsp; There appears to be no way to reset the box to the default settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pascor</strong> on 31 Oct 2011, 19:32)</p>
