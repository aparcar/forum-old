					<p>Hello,</p><p>I did a mistake, I installed strongswan-full on Linksys E1200 v2. It wrote on SSH no space left and turned I off the router and pressed RESET button at boot.<br />The router was pingable for 4 packages at boot on 192.168.1.1, I tried it several times, but always 4-5 packages and then nothing. The IP of bridge before was 192.168.0.254/24<br />I read about the failsafe modus, but either the reset nor the wps button at clicking at boot is working.</p><p>Is this device now gone away?, or is there some trick to reset the router?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
