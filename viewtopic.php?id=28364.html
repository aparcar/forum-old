					<p>My goal to to have the following DNS lookups resolve to the same IP address without hardcoding each fqdn in etc/config/dhcp or elsewhere (I&#039;m using the default DNSMASQ on a WNDR3700):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;host<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;host.domain1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;host.domain2</p><p>DHCP should issue &#039;domain1&#039; unless the host requests a different allowed domain.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried several different entries in &#039;local domain&#039; and &#039;local server&#039; in luci, and tried a few things directly in some config files, but I&#039;ve only been able to get &#039;host&#039; and &#039;host.domain1&#039; to work. The docs show how to set different domains to different IP ranges, but not sharing address space. </p><p>It seems that listing multiple domains after the &#039;search&#039; parm in resolv.conf would do the trick (if I understand correctly) but I haven&#039;t figured out a way to set with luci. What am I missing here. Pointers to any relevant doc would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance for all replies.</p><p>As a side note, I&#039;ve been using OpenWRT for several years and want to thank all the developers for making such a great product.</p>									</div>
