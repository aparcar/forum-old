					<p>In the Internet I&#039;ve found two instructions for debricking.<br />1. Run tftpd on your Windows computer with IP 192.168.0.66 or 192.168.1.66 (try both) with original firmware without bootloader, renamed to something like wr842ndv1_tp_recovery.bin (name of this firmware file doesn&#039;t have &quot;boot&quot; in its name). Power on router with pressed Reset button. You can download firmware by link <a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com/download/Factory/mr3020nv1_en_3_14_2_up(120817).bin">http://ofmodemsandmen.com/download/Fact â€¦ 20817).bin</a><br />2. Use console, there are pins on the board. Make sure, that you use 3.3V During boot processe type &quot;tpl&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 14 Nov 2016, 01:01)</p>
