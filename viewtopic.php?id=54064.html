					<p>Hi, all —</p><p>The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/easy.build">existing instructions on the wiki</a> are for &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot;, and I wanted to build &quot;Barrier Breaker&quot;. I also wanted to update <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/easy.build.macosx">the OS X instructions</a>, at least, since they&#039;re both out-of-date and reliant on MacPorts rather than Homebrew.</p><p>The build completed without any apparent problems on both platforms. I haven&#039;t tried actually flashing the image onto a device <br />yet — I only have the one at the moment — but I see no reason that it shouldn&#039;t work, it appears to have done all the correct things.</p><p>At any rate, I&#039;ve put this all together in a <a href="http://www.acme-dot.com/building-openwrt-14-07-barrier-breaker-on-ubuntu-and-os-x/">blog posting</a>. I&#039;d certainly appreciate any corrections or feedback, and I hope it&#039;s of some use to folks who want to play with this stuff...</p>									</div>
