					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m wondering if there is some limit on how fast an attacker can connect to wifi network and guess the password by bruteforce is it configureable in openwrt? </p><p>For example after 10 failed wifi attempts of bad guesses openwrt tells iptables to drop mac and ip address of the station that tried to connect for increased security.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Pietia</strong> on 21 Mar 2016, 01:40)</p>

					<p>See <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/38891">this answer on security.stackexchange.com</a>. Specifically this paragraph:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Granted most attacks on WPA2 do not work like this (excluding those on WPS). Most attacks work by observing someone else&#039;s successful WPA2 handshake (listening in promiscuous mode) to a given access point (knowing the BSSID). Then locally run take that handshake through a password cracking program until they find a match. This cracking is done entirely by eavesdropping and offline cracking, so would not be detectable.</p></blockquote></div><p>You could only detect it if someone is bruteforcing the pre-shared key online, which is very inefficient compared to offline bruteforcing (and you would detect this by looking at the system log for unusual amounts of failed authentications). Pre-made automated Wi-Fi cracking tools will capture a handshake and bruteforce it offline. So in sum, you will only detect those who are stupid enough to run the attack online, but smart enough to implement their own bruteforcing automation. </p><p>Also, iptables won&#039;t stop them from trying to authenticate. I tried adding a rule blocking my phone MAC, it can still authenticate (or attempt to), it just can&#039;t do anything once it&#039;s authenticated.</p><p>My phone can still authenticate to the network (WPA2-PSK), it just can&#039;t do anything afterwards. You have to add them to the MAC filter of the Wi-Fi interface, that blocks authentication attempts. Which means an attacker can just change his MAC address and continue. The attacker demographic I consider to be relevant is perfectly capable of automating this.</p><p>Bottom line is I don&#039;t see this as feasible in any way. Pick a better pre-shared key, or better, implement WPA2-Enterprise as already suggested. I&#039;m running FreeRADIUS on a Linksys WRT610Nv1. FreeRADIUS, OpenVPN, tcpdump, USB storage support and LuCI with their dependencies fit in 8 MB flash with &gt;1MB free space, so running it right on the router shouldn&#039;t be a problem (you don&#039;t need a separate device for RADIUS). With the right setup you also get perfect forward secrecy, which is a significant bonus compared to pre-shared keys.</p>									</div>
