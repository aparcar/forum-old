					<p>I&#039;m looking for a low power, inexpensive system to read an SR04 ultrasonic sensor and have the output available on a built-in web server on a WIFI connection.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am hoping to do this using a system running OpenWRT.</p><p>I&#039;ve come across a GL-AR150 board (based on the Atheros 9331) which claims to have 5 GPIO pins, and I&#039;m hoping I can wire an SR04 compatible sensor up to these, although if there are other more suitable boards I&#039;m certainly happy to use a different one if it meets my needs.</p><p>The issue I have is that timing is quite critical - the SR04 sends a pulse and measures how many microseconds it takes to return, from which distance can be calculated.&nbsp; I would thus assume that scripting something in BASH is not a viable option.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anyone know of a library or way I can send a trigger and then read the output of one of these sensors?&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve found a couple of hints how this could be achieved on a Raspberry Pi - <a href="http://ananddrs.com/2014/03/11/raspberry-pi-ultrasonic/">http://ananddrs.com/2014/03/11/raspberry-pi-ultrasonic/</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wdalmut/libultrasonic/blob/master/src/hc_sr04/hc_sr04.c">https://github.com/wdalmut/libultrasoni â€¦ /hc_sr04.c</a> but both of these seem to call or relate to &quot;bcm&quot; - is there an equivalent way I can do this with on a basic OpenWRT based board with built in WIFI ?</p><p>Thanks,<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for this.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve researched the ESP8266 is not powerful enough to use directly as it does not expose 2 GPIO pins and (as far as I can see) does not provide the required functionality (particularly timer) for an SR04.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is pretty cool though.</p>									</div>
