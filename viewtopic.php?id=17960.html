This script sets default policies for all chains, creates basic targets for accepting and dropping packets, and configures basic network address translation. It then calls the user configuration file /etc/firewall.user. It is neither necessary nor desirable to modify the startup script. Customization should be done in the user configuration file.</p></blockquote></div><p>so firewall.user should be loaded automatically?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>canni</strong> on 9 Dec 2008, 14:08)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t think this is easily doable using just the default firewall configuration utility.&nbsp; Here are the iptables rules you need to make it work:</p><p>First, look into the REDIRECT target, which is a bit different than the DNAT target.&nbsp; Instead of changing the destination to a specified IP, it redirects the destination of the packet to the host machine, changing just the destination port.&nbsp; So, try the following rule:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A zone_wan_prerouting -p tcp --dport [external port] -j REDIRECT --to-ports 22</code></pre></div><p>then, accept packets with dport of 22:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A input_wan -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>The one catch to doing it this way is that this solution will mean that you can ssh into your system on either port 22 OR your external port.&nbsp; This is because incoming connections on the external port get redirected to port 22, and then everything on port 22 gets accepted to input.&nbsp; That means incoming connections on port 22 are equally valid.</p><p>This situation is often not what you want because you may want to make it less obvious for a possible attacker to find which port is associated with what service, so having an external port 22 open, with ssh running on it may not be a good idea.&nbsp; There are two ways to deal with this: the easy way and the hard way.&nbsp; The easy way is to add the following rule in the nat table immediately after the first, specified above:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A zone_wan_prerouting -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP</code></pre></div><p>This rule drops packets that have an initial dport of 22.&nbsp; Those that have been dnated aren&#039;t affected because after they hit the REDIRECT target, they cease going on through the chain.&nbsp; The reason this is the easy way, and why this may not be the ideal solution is that for this to work you have to use the DROP target, and not the REJECT target.&nbsp; The DROP target is valid everywhere but REJECT is only valid in the filter table.&nbsp; It&#039;s also generally considered bad form to use DROP in the nat table.&nbsp; </p><p>So, suppose we want to REJECT packets coming in on port 22 while allowing those on our external port to connect to ssh?&nbsp; Use the MARK target.&nbsp; Add this rule to the nat table, after the REDIRECT rule:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A zone_wan_prerouting -p tcp --dport 22 -j MARK --set-mark 0x10</code></pre></div><p>And then add this to the beginning of your input chain in the filter table:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I input_wan -m mark --mark 0x10 -j REJECT</code></pre></div><p>Problem solved!</p><p>The reason I know all this is because I figured it out after significant trial and error.&nbsp; I implemented (and automated) this solution for my Gargoyle web interface for openwrt (<a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com">www.gargoyle-router.com</a>), and I use it to forward ports for both the web interface and ssh.</p>									</div>

					<p>The iptables rules that get generated definitely look like those that should get generated based on the definition in your firewall config provided, but they definitely won&#039;t solve your problem.&nbsp; Packets that go through the forwarding chain don&#039;t get sent to your router.&nbsp; Only packets that get sent through the input chain are going to reach services running on your router.</p><p>So, if your router had a static ip of 192.168.1.3 and 192.168.1.1 was some other machine on your internal network this would work great to forward ssh to that machine.&nbsp; But the packets going through the forward chain never reach the router.&nbsp; The rule on the input chain to accept port 31337 is entirely useless, as by the time the packets reach this point the packets have a destination port of 22 thanks to your dnat rule.&nbsp; Also, if you had some service running on port 31337 this would now be exposed to the wan.</p>									</div>
