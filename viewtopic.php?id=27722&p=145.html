					<p>&quot;Hi all, I am trying for a while to set up my WNDR3700v2 acting as a VPN server. Unfortunately no success yet. Actually I succeeded to establish L2TP connection to the router while it was running one of the arokh&#039;s builds. The point is that at that moment I couldn&#039;t make my USB printer to work properly so I flashed back to the normal Backfire image. I would be grateful if someone answer what build will be OK to run a kind of VPN server and printer daemon properly together. Thanks&quot;</p><p>OK with the Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1 I have all the needed features so far. The only thing I would appreciate suggestions is the VPN. I want to set up a VPN connection from the Internet to my router in order to access my home LAN features. In addition the option to route my Internet traffic through the VPN will be great. So what type of VPN will be OK to do that and which is the easiest to configure: OpenVPN, PPTP, L2TP ...?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>beka765</strong> on 10 Apr 2013, 08:19)</p>

					<p>@johan81: I thought so as I upgraded from stock firmware and used the &quot;factory&quot; image (although I note that stock Netgear firmware is based on an old OpenWRT version ...). </p><p>The Gargoyle (1.5.9) install (as &quot;sysupgrade&quot; image) then had no issues and runs as expected.

					<p>Guys I guess I found a small issue with the DHCP daemon.</p><p>I want to publish my router (192.168.2.22) as NTP server via DHCP.
