					<p>Stop for a moment and think of the implications of the name of the release changing from &quot;experimental&quot; to &quot;development&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot; etc</p><p>This would mean all docs referring to experimental will have to be updated, as experimental moves to development etc etc</p><p>eg from <a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GS?highlight=%28OpenWrtDocs%29">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware â€¦ WrtDocs%29</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>1.3. WRT54GS v2.0</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The WRT54GS v2.0 uses a BCM5325EKQM switch and a BCM4712LKFB processor. These units are supported in the <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> branch of OpenWrt.</p></blockquote></div><p>The situation gets worse, as with each subsequent release, the docs will again have to be updated. Maintaining the docs as a Wiki with this approach rapidly becomes unworkable.</p><p>OpenWRT is now mature enough to warrant a version numbering scheme for each release, with full release numbers and point releases. Plus it would be easier to refer to OpenWRT1.2 rather than the &quot;non-experimental 24-5-2005 release&quot;.</p><p><strong>DEVS: Please introduce a version numbering scheme for OpenWRT releases </strong></p>									</div>
