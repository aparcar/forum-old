					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have a Netgear D6200 router+modem braodcasting a wifi signal. I want to use my MR3020 to allow my Xbox One to connect through a VPN (NordVPN, specifically).</p><p>So it&#039;ll be connected as follows: D6200 &lt;--(wifi)--&gt; MR3020 &lt;--(ethernet)--&gt; Xbox One</p><p>The issue is that it seems Chaos Calmer is too big to fit comfortably on the MR3020, but the luci openvpn app is unavailable on previous versions. I don&#039;t mind having a usb drive plugged into the MR3020 to use extroot, but the image generator is daunting to me.</p><p>Could someone build an image for me, to simply plug my MR3020 into my Xbox and have it act as a wifi dongle with VPN? At this point, I&#039;m too exhausted to care about security, so I&#039;m fine with using PPTP to connect to a single vpn server. Even if I have to manually change the server address every time it needs to be changed.</p>									</div>
