					<p>Hey, guys</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWrt, so I would really appreciate your help with my problem.<br />I installed the latest stable build on my TP-Link Archer C7 v2.0. Everything went smoothly, I configured the device according to my needs and thought that was it.</p><p>I made my home server available online with port forwarding and this is where I got stuck. On the first glance the server works - ssh connection, web-server, mail-server, everything seems fine. But when I connect to the server from outside (Internet), I only stay connected for about a couple of minutes: ssh disconnects with &#039;Broken pipe&#039; message even if it&#039;s not idle, and when I try to upload some big file to the web server, the connection drops after some time as well.</p><p>I checked the network-related kernel settings (with sysctl -a) and even compared them to those of dd-wrt router (which worked perfectly in the same setup), but still couldn&#039;t find the reason why the connections stop.</p><p>So, now I&#039;m stuck and would really appreciate your help! I don&#039;t want to return to my old router, but for now this is the only option.</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>
