					<p>@SlavoF</p><p>Why do you want a 3.18 build? Official ar71xx images are 4.1 for trunk. coxmobil/bouwew have the wdr4900/mpc85xx which is still on 3.18 but I adapted the patches to apply with 4.1. Their problem does not apply for you. Simply install packages compatible with your build or build yourself. Kernel version does not demand a specific libc version.</p><p>@Crayne</p><p><a href="http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/source-tree/files/etc/uci-defaults/99-arokh">http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/s … s/99-arokh</a></p><p>There isn&#039;t a proper way to do backups/restore, you will need knowledge of every part of the system. Unofficially you can usually use sysupgrade with success, but some times things can and will break.</p><p>A personal UCI script and backup of certificates should let you replicate your settings efficiently though, but don&#039;t ask me to support it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi @arokh I just took the plunge and clean installed r46672 on my WNDR3700v4 and everything looking good - I&#039;ve held off upgrading for ages because of the need to wipe config, but didn&#039;t take too long to re-apply and looks like everything is running nicely - thank you for your great work!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey @arokh, just registered to say thanks for your build. i had bought a WNDR3800CH for the sole purpose of using CeroWRT but I found out your build is much, much more polished and updated. </p><p>Right now I&#039;m rocking r46584&nbsp; and couldn&#039;t be happier.</p><p>I do have a question, and forgive me in advance if it&#039;s better suited elsewhere: I have OpenVPN routed through Tor and everything is working perfectly, but I was wondering if it&#039;s possible to have a different profile that routes the connection through the router instead of teh Tor network, for when I simply need to check on my local server from work.</p><p>Again, many thanks for this excellent addition to OpenWRT, and sorry if my question is misplaced.</p><p>Cheers from Colombia!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey arokh!</p><p>Could you help me figure out what might be the problem here?</p><p>I was using your r44590 build on an Archer C7 v2, it was working okay.<br />Today I tried updating to the r46693. I always use the TFTP recovery method for updating. The file transfer went okay, however the router did not update properly, it rebooted but then only the system led was on and one of the the LAN indicators, I couldn&#039;t reach the router and it never assigned an IP through DHCP to my computer.</p><p>So I tried going back through the versions to see which one worked and I found out that the last version that works correctly is the r46434. That is what I am using now.<br />You made two r46434 versions and the r46434-2 is the first one that doesn&#039;t work, anything before that works fine, anything after that does not work, router becomes unreachable.</p><p>I don&#039;t see anything Archer specific in the changelog for that version in there so I don&#039;t understand what caused this.<br />Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>That is very odd indeed, I can&#039;t imagine what change did that. Perhaps the -O2 produces some bad code with musl on that architecture?

					<p>Hello.</p><p>Something curious happens. I have a Archer C5 configured with firmware of arokh for Movistar FFTH (using VLAN). I have a 300Mb / 30Mb. If I connect cable, only I get to 220-200Mb. If you use the original Movistar modem, I get the 300Mb.&nbsp; If I set the archer C5 with the same firmware but instead of using it as a modem, is only connected to the Movistar router, then I get back to 300Mb.<br />You know that it may be due? Perhaps the router is not powerful enough to make modem / router?</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

Checked the openvpn config and i can see that they&#039;re referenced.</p><p>You mentioned being able to use the caCert.pem file created by the new vpn.sh script, do i need to alter the Openvpn config to point at the files in /etc/CA/?</p><p>Let me know if you want any logs.</p><p>As always, your amazing work, and continued support of it, are hugely appreciated, man!!</p><p>Wriggerz</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wriggerz</strong> on 21 Aug 2015, 20:26)</p>
