					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am a owner of an WRT54G wireless router, and I am considering getting a service of VoIP pretty soon. I was wondering if I could hear some experiences, from users of OpenWRT who have dealt with VoIP? What are your impressions?</p><p>Basically I think that the most important feature for this, is QoS/Traffic Shaping. Does OpenWRT support this? How good are those packages?</p><p>Thanx!</p>									</div>
