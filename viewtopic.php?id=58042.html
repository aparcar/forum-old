					<p>Hi,</p><p>Is there such a thing like a development/debug build for OpenWRT?<br />Could there be a reason for a performance difference between a stable image downloaded from this website and a manually built image from trunk?<br />(I&#039;m thinking maybe some optimization flags)</p><p>This is totally speculative, but a couple of months ago I was testing the openvpn performance on an WR1043ND and I noticed a slight difference (10-15%) between my trunk build (slower) and stock Barrier Breaker 14.07. (faster)<br />I was using the exact same settings, keys and clients, and tested on wire/LAN.<br />Also, both builds used the same openvpn and openssl versions.</p><p>I know that there are other factors that may come into play, I&#039;m just asking to make sure this isn&#039;t one of them.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I understand that. I guess I didn&#039;t ask the question right.<br />I&#039;m interested strictly in build options/settings, if there are any differences between trunk and stable, which could affect the performance in any way.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not answering your question... but OpenWrt is usually built with -Os and if you build it yourself you can use -O2. It will probably produce a larger and faster image.</p>									</div>

					<p>Also, if you build your own firmware, you can select/deselect any packages/ptions to include/exclude, respectively, into/from firmware. You can even trim the kernel as you wish.</p>									</div>
