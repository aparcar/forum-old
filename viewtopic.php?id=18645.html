I had two units of my WRT54GS v3 flashed with a DD-WRT v23sp1 firmware. After I did some configuration, a reboot caused both my WRT54GS bricked with power LED flashes fast. To recover my WRT54GS v3 units, all I did was to issue an <em>nvram clear</em> through a serial console. Once that was done, my WRT54GS did an auto reboot with and performed an auto <em>nvram commit</em>. Then, both my WRT54GS v3 units came back and are now flashed and running with a DD-WRT v24sp1 firmware with no problem. I would recommend to get a USB/Serial-console cable to access its serial-console port to first check its boot scripts already properly configured to run the OpenWRT firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I don&#039;t know what I have done but now it is working properly. I have made a hard reset and also by pressing the reset button. For once I&#039;ve been lucky. Cause the first one I tried it was burned ...</p><p>Burned why? By the serial hacking. And there it goes my question. This one is working and it seems that I get something through minicom on rooter bootup. I have it configured 115200 8N1 but on the screen I&#039;m getting strange symbols. Any idea? The same circuit has worked on a WRT54Gv5 without any problem.</p><p>TA</p>									</div>
