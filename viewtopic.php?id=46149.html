					<p>I overclocked my little old router to try and bring some life back into it before i went out to spurge on another younger model lol.. needless to say i got to about 280mhz and it stopped...&nbsp; so he is my current situtation..</p><p>I cant ping 192.168.1.1<br />I cant get to the GUI at that address</p><p>The router is functioning however. When i look at the status of the connection its giving me ip address and gateways as if i were plugged straight into the cable modem..</p><p>Is there any way to flash this back? I have tried the 30/30/30 to no avail. I have NOT tried the shorting of pins as of yet.</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>									</div>
