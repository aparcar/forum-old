					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a DLink-615 router with two sets of ports. One for the internet (WAN), and four for my LAN. I&#039;m currently living in my student digs, and I can only register one computer to use their internet. I&#039;d like to use my tablet, hence trying this out. They check your MAC address when you login too, but if I was to change this to the MAC address of my WAN interface, I&#039;d be able to use my tablet, and also my other computers that&#039;re connected to the LAN interface. </p><p>Is it possible to route the data from these two ports? I spent alot of time Yesterday with IPTables, but I&#039;m having no luck. I&#039;m currently looking at using the web interface to achieve this. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>If your internet provider don&#039;t do DPI,what&#039;s you need is just like &quot;a piece of cake &quot; with openwrt.<br />Just change your WAN mac,and with the NAT will hiden the PC connect to LAN/WLAN.</p><p>Don&#039;t try to touch the iptables directly,study the uci and config file for openwrt in the wiki.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m having such trouble with this. I&#039;ve got the same model router at home, and it was literally just plug n play. At my student digs/residence, I can change the MAC address of the system connected to the internet (I only can use one machine for the internet here. If I use another machine, I&#039;m granted to a website where I need to change the MAC address of the system that needs access to the internet). I&#039;ve change this to the WAN of my DLINK router. I can ping google etc. However, from my LAN I still cannot ping outside at all. Am I missing something important here? I&#039;ve been trying all day. What a n00b I am.</p>									</div>

					<p>Normally it should just work with the default configuration of openwrt, plug wan to your ISPs ethernetplug, and your devices to the lan-ports. <br />If this doesn&#039;t work maybe your ISP implemented some countermeasures against NAT/routers.<br />I don&#039;t think they are doing DPI, but there is a quite easy approach to make NAT quite difficult: maybe they set the TTL of packages they send to your devices (router) to 1, so your router won&#039;t forward any packages to LAN because they exceeded their time to life, and are discarded. Just check the TTL-value of the replied ping-packets.<br />if that&#039;s the case you have to modify the ttl (maybe in both directions to avoid detection) <br />check this: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Iptables#Modifying_the_TTL">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ip â€¦ ng_the_TTL</a><br />to use it with openwrt just add this to /etc/firewall.user make sure firewall.user is included in /etc/config/firewall, and you have to change the command get_wanface in the reverse single quotes which should get the name of the wan interface. the uci syntax would be `uci get network.wan.ifname`, or just use the actual interface-name</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 18 Sep 2012, 08:29)</p>

					<p>Hi. I&#039;ve just restored my DLINK firmware back to its original settings. I&#039;m now able to connect to the internet, so at at-lease I know that the TTL won&#039;t be an issue (I had a feeling this might be). I&#039;m going to reinstall openWRT on my router again. So confusing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting. I&#039;ve just came back to my parents home where I have the exact same router + model number, with the exact same compiled firmware. The router at home, has the same MAC address for all of my interfaces. The one at my University digs have two separate ones. One for the WAN and another for the LAN. I can honestly say I haven&#039;t touched any of these. Really weird. Hopefully, when I get back I&#039;ll be able to get openWRT install at my University digs :-D. This must obviously be why I&#039;m having troubles.</p>									</div>
