					<p>Hi</p><p>I have a Pogoplug E02, it was previously used to run Debian and so the original u-boot was replaced by one from Jeff Doozan which then chainloaded the original u-boot if no USB device was present.</p><p>I restored the original Cloud Engine&#039;s u-boot as the sole u-boot and all was well. BTW I&#039;m using a serial console cable to do these steps.</p><p>Today I started installing OpenWRT onto this Pogoplug as per the instructions in the Wiki (&quot;<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/cloudengines/pogoplug">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/cloudengines/pogoplug</a>&quot;).</p><p>So the 1st thing I did was installed the 2nd stage OpenWRT u-boot from the stock Cloud Engine&#039;s u-boot:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mw 0x800000 0xffff 0x80000
tftpboot 0x800000 openwrt-kirkwood-pogo_e02_second_stage-u-boot.img
nand erase 0x100000 0x80000
nand write.e 0x800000 0x100000 0x80000</code></pre></div><p>and then did &quot;reset&quot; to reboot. I did this as, according to the Wiki, the rootfs has to be installed from the 2nd stage u-boot console rather than the stock u-boot.</p><p>As expected after the reset the Pogoplug booted into the stock u-boot which then chainloaded into the 2nd stage OpenWRT u-boot which displayed several lines and then stopped displaying anything further after the &quot;Verifying Checksum ... OK&quot; line:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>USB 0: host mode

					<p>Hi rayknight</p><p>On Qui&#039;s page in the comments he states that the procedure is not suitable for the E02 and indicated (in June last year) he would post a E02-specific procedure later...</p><p>His procedure requires to have either Debian or ArchLinux already running on the Pogoplug - in my case I only had the stock OS installed before I put on the 2nd stage OpenWRT u-boot, Haven&#039;t tried rebooting yet to see if the stock Cloud Engines OS is even still there after the u-boot flash.</p><p>I&#039;ll drop him a message to see if he has any E02 notes written yet.</p>									</div>
