					<p>Hey all,<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve installed the latest OpenWRT on my Linksys 1900AC Gen 1.&nbsp; I&#039;ve followed this documentation to set it up as an AP.</p><br /><p>wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</p><p>This works well except for adding the WAN port to the LAN.&nbsp; I&#039;m using it as a wireless AP and switch. I want to link my WAN port to the LAN.&nbsp; Unfortunately I need all the ports.&nbsp; I tried the following.</p><p>Go to the WAN interface<br />Set protocol to Unmanaged and Save<br />Go to LAN interface<br />Click on Physical Settings<br />Select Ethernet Adapter: &quot;eth1&quot; Ethernet Adapter: &quot;eth1&quot; (wan, wan6)<br />Save and Apply</p><p>However, this doesn&#039;t create the bridge I was expecting where WAN (eth1) and LAN (eth0) are on the same bridge.<br />Any suggestions?</p>									</div>
