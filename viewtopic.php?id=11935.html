					<p>This is more of an academic exercise.&nbsp; What I am curious about is what different people, particularly those experienced with wireless routers and other embedded devices, feel is the best way to debrick or otherwise (re-)initialize a device ... if you had the ability to specify that all future devices shall work that way (which is a stretch, given some manufacturers don&#039;t want us to run anything but their firmware on our own hardware that we paid for).</p><p>Presumably the default answer is JTAG.&nbsp; But is that stll the best choice even today?&nbsp; It is certainly not the simplest.&nbsp; But would it be any better to have direct capability to do this via connections like ethernet or USB or even a serial port?&nbsp; It could be secured to physical access by having a jumper or DIP switch to enable it.&nbsp; Of course if this is software controlled from the board end, that has to be unwritable software so you can&#039;t break that capability (which also means you can&#039;t update it if it is buggy).</p><p>Think about it in terms of you being the designer of a new product where the manufacturer is intending that it be capable of hackers/hobbyists being about to reload their own routers/devices (but not those of others they don&#039;t have physical access to).&nbsp; What would you do in the design to make an UNerasable means to reload the flash securely?</p>									</div>
