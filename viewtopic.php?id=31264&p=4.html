Oh you do use a USB-TTL cable right? Today many of those cables use fake chips and cause many issues.<br />I don&#039;t want those fake cable to bother me, and I did it in a hard way, I set up my beaglebone black to communicate with the router, and it works great. You may not want to buy a SBC if you don&#039;t have one, but at least use some genuine chip cable, don&#039;t just grub a random one from ebay or amazon...<br />Off topic: The RT3050 is a bullet proof chip, I used to be so stupid and use a RS232 cable on it... That is +-13v instead of single 3.3v... But the RT3050 survives anyway.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello mrt8.<br />Sad to say the cable you ordered is more fake than genuine, especially it says &quot;TTL&quot; and &quot;RS232&quot; at the same time. From the picture I think it&#039;s a TTL, not RS232, but I do not recommend use it anyway.<br />Technically, RS232 and TTL are different and cannot be done in the same cable, RS232 not only have a much higher voltage level, but it&#039;s reversed: <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/215">https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/215</a>, although it didn&#039;t destroy my router, it cannot work either.<br />You should have no problem using Raspberry pi, that should be way more stable and safe over those fake cables, your problem is very odd.<br />Sam</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sam1275</strong> on 31 Jan 2017, 06:27)</p>

Such as error or debug message on serial or computer, anything you think it&#039;s worth mention.<br />For a quick trouble shoot:<br />Did you connect the physical rj45 correctly between router Lan port and PC?<br />Did the firewall on your PC prevent the connection? (My nod32 did block it)<br />Did you manually assign the IP address to the PC, the same as you set in router serial?<br />Did you put the bin image with a short file name in the TFTP server directory?<br />PS: the above assume you use your PC as TFTP server.<br />I use tftpd32 on windows 7, set the router IP in the firewall exception, and everything is fine.<br />Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>im not sure anymore what exactly the issue has been i double checked the cables they seem fine, i followed serial troubleshooting. i killed some processes associated with serial and it just worked if i opened it fast enough. trying to reproduce the same results i fail. </p><p>i think something is off with my raspberry pi it cant be explained otherwise.</p><p>as for the tftp first i tried with linux did all according to how it should but it didnt work. next i tried it with many variants of software on windows. and as you say creating rules in the firewall etc. however since im back at getting the router to respond in the bootload, btw i would like to mention that i tried various methods which all had a same result minicom, putty, screen. </p><p>i think i might receive the usb ttl today or tomorrow heard they usually have a voltage switch of 3,3 to 5 v. ive been wasting so much time just to get it to accept a keystroke so ill just try my luck with it using windows via usb.</p><p>will update about how the process goes i have hope it will work however since i got it working for a bit im sure it will be fixed in the end.</p><p>really appreciate the support by the way</p>									</div>

					<p>I use picocom with USB adapters under Linux.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very basic program.</p><p>To test your serial host, when you connect the TX and RX wires together (not to a router) you should be able to see what you type.&nbsp; This is known as a hardware loop-back test.&nbsp; If you break the connection you should not see what you type.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 1 Feb 2017, 18:02)</p>

					<p>what is weird however is i couldnt push a file within linux but when i opened my tftp share i suddenly found a file openwrt.bn (the router has been bricked due to incorrect flashing openwrt)</p><p>i cant remember if i did a pull request to test it but it should have worked both ways, forgot to mention yes did the ips manually both in windows and linux. however i just had an hour window where the router would process my keystrokes so cant say too much with too much confidence yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>i have one last question,<br />my current setup is using the r36 as a repeater<br />it consists of 24 dbi parabolic, awus036h (rtl8187) and a 9dbi omni on the router itsself.<br />does someone know what else i could do for finetweaking it for such a setup and furthermore,<br />since its my first time working on the r36 with openwrt are there any packages or setup types for this hardware that are worth mentioning? </p><p>im having a bit of struggle yet since the AP sometimes resets, the connection has great signal quality but fluctuates from high speed to low or not responding alltogether and sometimes the web interface or the router itsself does not respond.</p><p>i flashed the latest build, this all is happening with standard settings and/or minimal changes<br />________________________________________________edit</p><p>got it stable for now nothing helped, an external powered usb hub did the trick if it is due to this</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrt8</strong> on 2 Feb 2017, 16:12)</p>
