					<p>Does anyone know under what platform is the Netgear <a href="http://www.netgear.com/Products/CommunicationsVoIP/Skype/SPH200W.aspx">SPH200W</a> based on? I took a look at the <a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/937/kw/GPL%20SPH200W/r_id/100109">SPH200W firmware</a> (<a href="ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/SPH200W_1.2.0.2_src.tar.bz2">source code v1.2.0.2</a>), the ARCH variable on its gcc-3.4.1 is set to <em>armeb</em>. I don&#039;t suppose this is compatible with a Boradcomm MIPs platform chipsets used on a Linksys WRT54G/S and/or Netgear WGt634U WiFi routers. Otherwise, the Skype binary codes can be extracted from the <a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/937/kw/GPL%20SPH200W/r_id/100109">SPH200W firmware</a> and installed on any Linksys WRT54G/S and/or Netgear WGt634U WiFi routers to support Skype for Asterisk. Anyone?</p>									</div>

					<p>We know that the Phone is small cellphone-like in size, quality is medium to good...Easy to use, good memory and battery life compared to other models I&#039;ve tried...I also recommend using on a higher quality router. Then the Netgear platform has many ways to run the variable codes.It is better to support the Netgear.</p><br /><br /><p>_________________<br /><a href="http://www.inin.com">Call Center Software</a></p>									</div>
