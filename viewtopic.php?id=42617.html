					<p>This website was set up by a Chinese guy whose wife is a merchant on Aliexpress. (I&#039;d been complaining to her about how much trouble I was having finding an OpenWrt compatible router there.)</p><p>Apparently he had some initial interest, but then no sales &amp; he&#039;s more or less given up on it. So I said I&#039;d ask here what people interested in OpenWrt might want from a Chinese webstore specialising in compatible equipment. Done right I think such a website could offer a service to this community - as well as helping the website proprietor earn a living.</p><p>So if you have any suggestions*, please fire away. I&#039;ll point them at this thread (and help translate a bit if necessary).</p><p>(*Mine included:<br />- less heavy-handed SEO<br />- more technical info on the devices<br />- lower prices <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>denovo</strong> on 1 Mar 2013, 17:26)</p>

					<p>The tiny amount of china versus openWRT that I experienced is that they find a firmware and the install it even after HW updates that break it.<br />It is cat and mouse. I think the best option would be to have open OEM firmware.<br />openWRT is all about sharing. Chinese markets are all about selling huge volumes at small profit.<br />Who picks up the broken pieces?</p>									</div>

OpenWrt tweaking is certainly a niche, but there are some vendors inside China (on taobao, the ebay-equivalent) who service just such a niche. So maybe it&#039;s a big enough niche for an export-oriented vendor too?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>denovo</strong> on 1 Mar 2013, 17:39)</p>
