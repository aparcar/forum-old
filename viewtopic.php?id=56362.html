					<p>My problem got a little more interesting.<br />I reverted to the stock TP-Link firmware and guess what? Wireless still didn&#039;t work.<br />I thought the router came with problem.<br />But, I tried connecting using my phone and tablet and in both of them worked, 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.<br />So, only my laptop isn&#039;t ableto connect to the router.<br />I tried enabling only 2.4Ghz, different channels, disabling password...<br />Result is always the same: my laptop is able to connect to the wifi, but nothing loads, not even pings the router.<br />I tried booting my laptop in Linux, same result.</p><p>So, it seems that the router doesnt like my laptop <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>ps: the wifi adapter of the laptop is a broadcom 4313<br />any other wlan my laptop connects normally</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe your laptop driver supports only US channels 1-11 and you are on 12 or 13? This is typical for dell notebooks, whenever I have here one, I need to set lower channel <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
