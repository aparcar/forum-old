					<p>This is on a WL-500gP, Broadcom wireless NIC, using 8.09.It installed brilliantly.</p><p>The topology I&#039;d like</p><p>(wireless router upstream) --&gt; wlan0 client - bridged to &quot;wlan&quot; -&nbsp; (firewall) - &quot;internal lan ports&quot;</p><p>Basically, have the wifi act as a client, &quot;transparently&quot; bridge one of the ethernet ports (&quot;wlan&quot; in this case) so that devices on that port appear on the upstream network.&nbsp; Then the remaining LAN ports are inside the firewall with the usual NAT, iptables, etc.</p><p>I&#039;m actually quite close.&nbsp; The wifi client successfully connects to upstream, gets an IP, etc.&nbsp; Further, NAT is working so the &#039;internal&quot; ports work properly. </p><p>What I can&#039;t get working is the &quot;bridge&quot; to the wlan port.&nbsp; I&#039;ve created a bridge but have no evidence that it&#039;s passing traffic, etc.</p><p>Based on <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=84634#p84634">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=84634#p84634</a> it should be simple.&nbsp; Either it&#039;s a simple problem or it&#039;s impossible with this hardware?&nbsp; Who knows.</p><p>In any case, here&#039;s /etc/config/network</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;switch&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;
