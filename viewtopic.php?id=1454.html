					<p>Hi @all,</p><p>I would like to use the HFSC scheduling algorithm (because it produces good QoS results for VoIP). Unfortunately it is not included in kmod-sched.ipk. What steps do I have to do to get it running ?</p><p>I have a WRT54GS v. 1.1 so I am running the experimental release.<br />Many thanks in advance!</p><p>regards,<br />RenÃ©</p>									</div>

					<p>First thanks for your answer.</p><p>Does activated in cvs mean that I can just use it if I install the firmware from your snapshots ?

					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I&#039;m using Kamikaze 2.6 on Asus wl-500gP and lately, using hfsc scheduler I encountered a strange behaviour....</p><p>It is shaping traffic *way* beyond the set criteria. For example, setting the desired bandwidth to 10000 kbit/s results in throughput arround 75kbit/sec but when rising the level to 11000+ Kbit/s the result is arround 1,2 Mbit/sec.<br />Lowering or rising the desired throughput dows not produce any &quot;logical&quot; results (at least for me). (ex. 5000 Kbit/s produces 65Kbit/sec, 1000Kbit/s 60Kbit/s, 50000Kbit/s 1,3Mbit/s...)</p><p>WBX, is the bug you mention related to this issue?</p><p>I tried the *same* script on Kamikaze 2.6 x86 and it is working flawlessly. Other schedulers (htb, cbq) are working as expected it&#039;s only the hfsc that gives such strange results....</p><p>Lurking through the code of sch_hfsc I noticed a &quot;bug&quot;, which is clearly noted, regarding strange results on Gigabit speeds (did not tried to re-enable the disabled code).<br />I suppose the problem is somehow related to HZ (brcm: HZ=1000, x86: HZ=100) so I tried recompiling the schedulers using gettimeofday() but the results were the same....</p><p>Any ideas anyone?</p><p>Kind regards,<br />M.Culibrk</p>									</div>
