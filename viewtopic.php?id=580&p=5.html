					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve a catatonic WRT54G v2.0 to add to the list - this one, though, was not my fault. I was online last night and it just carked it. First the router/gateway function went, then when I rebooted (unplugged then replugged) it, I saw the following symptoms:</p><p>* Blinking power light<br />* WLAN / Internet / Switch port lights seemed to be functioning properly<br />* No response to pings.</p><p>I was running the Linksys (2.6?) firmware. No history of modification or third party firmware installs, I upgraded the firmware when I bought it so it would handle my cable login, and then left it alone. One network dropout the next day, solved by telling it to disconnect then reconnect to the cable heartbeat server, after which it worked perfectly for over a month.</p><p>The Linksys knowledgebase details exactly this scenario, but the reset button doesn&#039;t seem to be working. I hold down the reset button for 30+s with power on, with power off, while powering on, but no response from pings.</p><p>So, would you people recommend trying the trick shown on Void Main&#039;s site, or would I be safer just trying for a refund? At this point I haven&#039;t done anything that voids the warranty but the wholesaler I bought the router from has a track record of being slow to replace under warranty. I guess my main question is &quot;Are my chances of success good enough to make it worth blowing the warranty?&quot;</p><p>I&#039;ve got a ticket open with Linksys support about it, so I won&#039;t do anything until I get a response from them, at any rate.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Quin</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I installed a custom freya 2.06 firmware on my wap54g (the model with reset next to rj45) and now the LAN port is silent but the WLAN works. The thing is that the firmware is kinda broken (/tmp is a file so it cannot be mounted) and httpd refuses to start so I cannot upgrade it from the web interface. The telnet is enabled and I can access the AP over wlan. Can I somehow upgrade the firmware from the shell, I can mount ramdisk on mnt and wget the firmware over there but I haven&#039;t figured out a way to flash the firmware.</p><p>I also tried the tftp method but I couldn&#039;t quite get it to work. boot_wait is turned on so the AP should accept firmware via tftp on 192.168.1.1. I used atftp with trace mode on and timeout set to 1 and I got the following error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftp&gt; put WAP54G-fw2.08.08.trx
sent WRQ &lt;file: WAP54G-fw2.08.08.trx, mode: octet &lt;&gt;&gt;
source port mismatch, check bypassedtimeout: retrying..
tftp: aborting</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve also tried it with other firmwares, windows tftp and the results were always the same.</p><p>I read from another thread that the WAP54G should respond to ping about 3 seconds after power on but mine didn&#039;t. I tried multiple times.</p><p>The Diag led is on all the time and Lan/Act led blinks a few more times when trying to tftp the firmware than normally.</p><p>This is not really an OpenWRT question but this seemed like a good place to get response.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just tried today to install the experimental version of openwrt on my WRT54GS, no version number on the bottom, worked with the old stable of openwrt.

When the firmware is transferred the DMZ led stops blinking and keeps either constantly off or on, depending on the firmware. After this no ping is replied anymore and the box does not reboot. I have tried several firmwares but the result was always the same.</p><p>Has anyone an idea what I could try?</p>									</div>

					<p>I also bricked by WRT54GS v1.1. There is a lot to find about the WRT54G but few things about the GS (speedbooster). How did I do it? Simple: After installing OpenWRT I did a &#039;mtd erase nvram&#039; to start off with a clean nvram.<br />I alreadydid this a dozen of times on the normal WRT54G&#039;s but this time the power led just kept flashing: bricked...<br />I tried with uploading the standard Linksys firmware (ETSI version) several times. I was able to do this shorting pins 5&amp;6 on the flash chip. This invalidated the flash and allowed me to tftp the image... This didn&#039;t work.<br />I build a serial cable to see what was going on. This because the CFE was working but the OpenWRT kernel not booting. Well, what did I see: A lot of panics, corrupted memory etc... Damm...<br />With the Help of Iceberg who supplied me with an wholeflash.bin image of the WRT54GS v1.1 and the help of a JTAG cable I reflashed the whole lot. The first time it booted there were also a lot of panics etc but i repeated booting a feew times. Suddenly it came up and had a working DD-WRT image (that was on the image). I notices that sometimes it came up and had this stange message while booting: &#039;The sdram_init is 0x000b, not 0x010b&#039;. When it came up, I checked the nvram and the sdram_init was 0x010b.<br />I reflashed the OpenWRT software and still kermel panics. I was unable to set any NVRAM variables; the commit never returned from the commit function. Next I used the JTAG to clear the NVRAM and using the CFE monitor to set the sdram_init to 0x010b and it worked. Since, the WRT54GS is working like a charm...</p><p>Conclusion: The CFE does not create the sdram_init variable correctly. It should be set to 0x010b from the CFE if missing. What the 0x0100 value means is unclear to me; maybe a new type of ram? This parameter controls the RAM and looks like the kernel is booting with no ram (or somewhere in unallocated space).</p><p>I bought the WRT54GS in the Netherlands, so the EU version. I don&#039;t know if the sdram_init value of 0x010b is the same on all the WRT54GS v1.1 routers.</p><p>Hope this is usedful to someone who&#039;s frustrated not being able to get their WRT54GS up and running again!</p><p>I love OpenWRT, keep up the good work!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>seems like my GS 1.1 got bricked somehow today. I guess it happened when the power was cut in the wrong room<br />when the wrong fuse was removed in the fuse-box when doing some electricity wiring <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />But why it got messed up after this powerdown and refuses to boot properly is the question. *Anyone has a clue or anything at all?*</p><p>So I tried to boot into failsafe but the DMZ-led never came on, Power-led is blinking and the connected LANport-leds are on :C (well DMZ-led comes on for half a second or so right after I plug it in - seems like its the same issue as Gromit and some others experienced on the page1 in this thread)</p><p>Gromit:<br />&quot;One thing I noticed when plugging in power on the GS device was, that the DMZ and WLAN LEDs flash for a split second, even before the Power LED starts blinking and LAN1-4 and Internet light up for 1sec, then turn off. The G box does NOT do that. My assumption is, that the GS box performs some sort of reset or flush on the Intel flash that prevents the boot_wait procedure to perform normally. Maybe Linksys doesn&#039;t want us to hack this powerhouse of router!?&quot;</p><p>And I have always had the boot_wait ON but that doesnt seem to help since the router doesnt reply to pings at all and tftps time out...<br />So the next thing to try is to shorten pins 5-6 and try tftp again?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>the situation with my WRT54GS v3.0:<br />[1] Power LED flashes quickly (~5 Hz), DMZ slowly (~0.5 Hz), so the firmware is bad.<br />[2] I can TFTP self-built and official OpenWRT RC4 and RC5 as well as Linksys FW to 192.168.1.1 but the box never resets itself.

					<p>I bricked mine (wrt54gs v1) and i have hammered it with jtag for 2 days and the best I can get is erasing, flashing the memory, flashed wholeflash, cfe, cleared nvram, gone from good to bad to good again, now my power light flashes and my dmz light stays on but I still can&#039;t ping the 192.168.1.1 address, I am wondering if I reset the mac address, or something like above with the sd_ram change. anyways more research I guess.........</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a WRT54G V2 and have been having problems debricking this thing.<br />Before I built the JTAG cable I, possibly stupidly, did the pin shorting manuever and that got the ping back and I was able to TFTP firmware to it.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t do much though as it never would load.</p><p>So I built a JTAG cable, erase NVRAM, nothing.&nbsp; Erase CFE and reinstall with on from OpenWRT and Skynet.&nbsp; With either one I can ping the router and TFTP firmware too it, but after TFTP&#039;ing the firmware the Power light is still flashing quickly and the DMZ light is solid.&nbsp; Wait 15 minutes or so and power cycle the router, Power light flashing quickly, DMZ light flashing slowly, still pings, still tftps.&nbsp; I also tried flash:kernel and get the same thing.</p><p>I did a backup:CFE&nbsp; and compared with the uploaded file and they match exactly.&nbsp; I did a backup:kernel and they match up until the end of the firmware after that though there is garbage (not the FFFFFFF&#039;s from clearning), not sure if that is normal.&nbsp; The NVRAM never changes from FFFFFFFF.</p><p>So I was wondering if someone has a WHOLEFLASH.BIN for a V2 or any other ideas on how to fix this.&nbsp; <br />I guess my next step after that is serial cable?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
