					<p>I previously had Sveasoft firmware installed on my WRT54Gv2, and it featured QoS configs for Layer 2 based QoS.&nbsp; That is to say, one could configure packet priority based on which switch port frames came in from.&nbsp; I believe I recall that this was allegedly implemented in hardware, rather than being sent up to the host for CPU processing of TCP headers &amp; so forth, and therefore allegedly offered significant improvements in jitter performance.</p><p>A little googling around seems to indicate that the magic phrase may be &quot;Ethernet Port Priority&quot;.</p><p>Am I completely mistaken about this, or is this functionality built into the WRT54G chips?&nbsp; If so, can it be configured in OpenWRT, and how?</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>That is possible with the help of VLANs and iptables/tc.</p><p>First you must to separate your LAN ports to different VLANs - otherwise you can&#039;t tell which LAN port the traffic is coming from. Then you&#039;ll have a bunch of new VLAN interfaces (e.g., eth0.1, eth0.2 and so on) instead of the original LAN interface (eth0 in this case). This can be done using /etc/config/network, vconfig and ifconfig.</p><p>iptables is capable of MARK&#039;ing packets based on the interface where they&#039;re coming from. (You can also match different ports, source/dest addresses, application layer stuff (with layer7 module) just to mention a few.)</p><p>For example you can set (internal) priority of 1 to TCP packets that are coming from eth0.2, and prio 2 for eth0.3 packets: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0.2 -p tcp -j MARK --set-mark 1
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0.3 -p tcp -j MARK --set-mark 2</code></pre></div><p>Then you can use tc to filter packets to different QoS classes using those priority marks:<br />(note that you must have your QoS rules set up before filtering... see LARTC below)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
tc filter add dev $WAN_IF parent X:Y protocol ip prio 1 handle 1 fw classid Z:AA
tc filter add dev $WAN_IF parent X:Y protocol ip prio 2 handle 2 fw classid Z:BB
...</code></pre></div><p>Internet is full of manuals and guides for iptables and there&#039;s also lots of material about tc and Linux specific and generic traffic shaping (that&#039;s what you are doing here). </p><p>Good but a bit old guide is Linux Advanced Routing &amp; Traffic Control HOWTO (http://lartc.org/). Nice site about iptables is at <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/Linux_Firewall_iptables/index.html">http://www.linuxtopia.org/Linux_Firewal â€¦ index.html</a> .</p><p>HTH</p><p>-- <br />kurkku</p>									</div>
