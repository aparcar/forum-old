					<p>That was my impression of TP-Link versioning schemes, yes.&nbsp; I think the wiki is accurate, and wonder if there&#039;s not a bug or misconfiguration somewhere I&#039;ve missed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the router is not throwing any demonstrable errors, so it is difficult to diagnose this fact.</p><p>EDIT: It was a power issue.&nbsp; It appears the measly 9V 600mA plugpack doesn&#039;t like being run to capacity, so I dropped the TX power from the 27dB setting (which appears to be capped at 18dB anyhow) to 15dB and it has remained perfectly stable under deliberately grueling traffic conditions.&nbsp; My WRT841N came fitted with high-gain +5dB antennae, so I&#039;m not hugely concerned about having to drop the power much, and it does not seem to have produced any ill effects.&nbsp; I had run out of space in my JFFS partition, so I had to firstboot it and reconfigure to get anywhere - this only took a minute or two.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Beacon515L</strong> on 6 Apr 2013, 05:15)</p>

					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I just wanted to share a successful OpenWrt installation story:</p><p>I have recently bought TP-Link TL-WR841ND v8.1 and immediately decided to try OpenWrt on it. I have used the Attitude Adjustment 12.09 RC2 version of the OpenWrt image for TP-Link TL-WR841N v8.x. In particular, I have used the squashfs image for OpenWrt installation over a stock TP-Link (factory) firmware (i.e. <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc2/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin">this</a> one). I simply used the web interface of the stock firmware to upload the OpenWrt image to the router. After the router rebooted, everything worked fine.</p><p>I have logged in using telnet, set up root&#039;s password, logged in using ssh, set-up public-key authentication, removed wpd-mini and hostapd-mini, installed wpa_supplicant and hostapd, logged in using web interface (LuCI), set up the wifi encryption and performed some reboots for testing. Everything seems to be working fine so far.</p><p>The real speed between WAN and wired LAN ports that I have been able to achieve is ~11,7 MB/s (93.6 Mb/s), which is pretty decent over a 100baseT / Full Duplex network. I haven&#039;t tested the maximum speed of wireless network yet, but my phone is able to download at ~4,5 MB/s (36 Mb/s), which is acceptable I think (for a phone). Still, I am curious about the real maximum speed that this little router can deliver over wifi.</p><p>Overall, I am very satisfied with OpenWrt. It is amazing how easily can it change your stock 25$ router into almost fully-featured linux box. Great work and my regards to all the developers and the entire community! I really appreciate the effort you are putting in OpenWrt!</p><p>BTW: Is there a way to disable LuCI over WAN and wifi and leave it enabled over wired LAN only? I am asking because by default, there is no SSL and it could potentially be dangerous to login using wireless network... I know I can install luci-ssl, but the thing is I do NOT want LuCI over wifi enabled. I also know that I can create some fancy iptables rules... But I was just wondering whether there is some simpler way to do it... Something like turning LuCI off for eth0 and wlan0... ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there. I&#039;ve bought my TL-WR841N v8.1 and flashed it with openwrt. It works fine and now I&#039;m going to mod it with USB port. There was info at this topic that it&#039;s possible.

					<p>Hi,<br />I bricked my WR841N v8.2 router running OpenWRT by trying to reflash the tp-link firmware, a bin file which contained also the bootloader.<br />I managed to revive it by using the serial connection, without opening the housing of the router! Now my router is working again!</p><p>I just put some wires through the holes in the case to the first 3 pins from the 4-pin serial connector on the PCB, like in the pictures below. The 4-pin connector on this model is not exactly under a hole in the case, but it&#039;s not so difficult to reach it with the wires. </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://doc-0k-3k-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/r2l052r568dul9s1gn7p2fpo3jt9dric/1368453600000/12694288566728479810/*/0B88qvFjcQ8LbVjI4akdscWlVQ1k" alt="Image 1" /></span><br />Image 1 link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B88qvFjcQ8LbVjI4akdscWlVQ1k/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B88qvFj … sp=sharing</a></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://doc-0s-3k-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/r83m017f7i7kc52kssubgf35kpditjlq/1368453600000/12694288566728479810/*/0B88qvFjcQ8LbcjRvNzc2OE1nbEU" alt="Image 2" /></span><br />Image 2 link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B88qvFjcQ8LbcjRvNzc2OE1nbEU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B88qvFj … sp=sharing</a></p><p>What do you think, guys? Is my warranty still valid or it&#039;s void? I don&#039;t think the PCB got scratched in this process. I used wires from a UTP network cable.</p><p>I posted this if someone else needs / wants to play with the serial and is afraid of losing the warranty.<br />Good luck!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openwrt4553</strong> on 13 May 2013, 17:09)</p>

					<p>In my experience the only thing they would check is external condition and what firmware is running (if that: often it is cheaper for them just to flash without even checking).<br />Nice job on the wires without ruining the case though!</p>									</div>
