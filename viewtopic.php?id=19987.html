					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a Linsys wrt54g in which I mounted a serial port.</p><p>I have some problem while reading data over that serial, actually, with microcom I can perfectly read data from it but when I try to simply cat /dev/tts/0 nothing happens..<br />Why?</p><p>I forgot to say that I&#039;m not interested in microcom since I would like to poll the serial port buffer and not keeping on listening. Microcom doesn&#039;t let me read the data which are already into the buffer.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Mike</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikemike</strong> on 22 Apr 2009, 18:13)</p>
