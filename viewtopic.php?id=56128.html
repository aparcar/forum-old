					<p>I can see it on LuCI (mount points), there are entries in fstab and e2fsck is available in /rom, /overlay and extroot but there is no sign of e2fsck activity whatsoever in boot stage. The syslog throws warnings that the maximum mount count is reached and e2fsck should be applied (for my /dev/sda1). That&#039;s intended and done with mkfs/tune2fs on purpose (max mount count=10 or 1 week). The counter is reached but the system doesn&#039;t even seem to try to check the device. I also couldn&#039;t find any traces/scripts in preinit stage where this might be done. I use &#039;tune2fs -l /dev/sda1&#039; to check the counter (that resets indeed when i do a manual e2fsck).</p><p>I want to mount my external USB storage with &#039;async&#039; and i would rather filecheck once more than less. I also cannot unmount extroot easily so an built-in fsck in preinit would be very useful.</p><p>Anyone know some more about this not working even though there are options in LuCI?</p><p>ARV752DPW22 (Easybox 803)<br />USB Storage (/dev/sda1, extroot)<br />swap (/dev/sda2)<br />Barrier Breaker (stable)</p>									</div>
