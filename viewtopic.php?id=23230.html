					<p>Hi</p><p>I have been asked to set up OpenWRT for a test envirnoment.&nbsp; Is it possible to completely emulate the wifi router using OpenWRT? I would like to run WRT on a VM and use it to demonstrate how to set up a wireless router(I have it riunning in VMWare workstation, that part was not too difficult).&nbsp; Can I use WRT to completely emulate a wireless router?&nbsp; </p><p>I guess the real question is do I have to have a wireless router to dump the image onto, or is there a way to have OpenWRT BE the router, at least as an emulation of one.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t have to work, just want it to look like it does.&nbsp; I need to give students the look and feel of configuring a real wifi router.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Joe</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure I understand your question, so please forgive me if I don&#039;t address your issues.&nbsp; openWrt is an operating system for a router in a way similar to the way that Windows is an operating system for a PC.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what emulation environment would provide the networking inputs&nbsp; and outputs (wireless, wan, lan) that openWrt running in emulation could rout.&nbsp; But perhap you have one.</p><p>For students, I would think that hands-on with a real device would be helpful--preferably one which is hard to brick (such as my favorite on the low end, the WL-520gU (or without USB, the WL-520gC)--but be aware that those are broadcom and wireless works best (most features) with a 2.4 kernel, not the current 2.6 kernel).</p>									</div>
