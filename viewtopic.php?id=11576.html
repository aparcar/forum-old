					<p>I am guessing your actual question would be: Is it possible to install a WINS server <span class="bbu">without</span> Samba? </p><p>I don&#039;t know of any WINS server without using Samba. If your hardware has too little memory to run Samba you have to think of an alternative. One might be installing Samba with WINS on a different machine but still using OpenWRT to hand out the address of this WINS server using DHCP. You can do this by setting an extra option in your dnsmasq configuration: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcp-option=44,192.168.1.45</code></pre></div><p>Where 192.168.1.45 would be your WINS server.</p>									</div>

					<p>My router is a WRT54GL, v1.1, no USB available...</p><p>I need to speed up Netbios resolution when I get connected from outside to a client LAN with OpenVPN. OpenVPN is working good but hosts resolution is quite slow (my networks places takes a lot of time to show up).</p><p>I think SAMBA could be a solution. Of course, client/server LAN arquitecture, and a SAMBA server... would be the optimal solution but...not by the moment.</p><p>In some discution on this forum readed that is possible to install big packages like SAMBA with the following procedure:</p><p>&quot; USB... Or extract the package to an NFS share and symlink the appropriate files where needed.<br />I have tons of stuff installed on my WRTs this way &quot;</p><p>Have you try this ?, or Definitively I need to install a SD memory or a LAN SAMBA server ?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>
