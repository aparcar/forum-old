					<p>Hi!<br />I have an TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1 with OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r42139.<br />Also i have two dsl lines<br />- wan wich have 8 Mb download<br />- wan2 wich have 16Mb dowload.<br />I want to split download traffic between these two lines using mwan3, so 66% to wan2 and 33% to wan.<br />Everything is configured like in wiki, work well except load balancig.<br />Behind router i have an lan from my school, so different connections from multiple totally random. After few hours, it&#039;s seems that more trafic are downloaded through wan not wan2.<br />This is my status for mwan3:</p><p>Interface status:<br />Interface wan is online (tracking active)<br />Interface wan2 is online (tracking active)</p><p>Policy balanced:<br /> wan2 (66%)<br /> wan (33%)</p><p>Policy wan2_only:<br /> wan2 (100%)</p><p>Policy wan2_wan:<br /> wan2 (100%)</p><p>Policy wan_only:<br /> wan (100%)</p><p>Policy wan_wan2:<br /> wan (100%)</p><p>Known networks:<br />destination&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hits&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />-----------------------------------------------<br />127.0.0.0/8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; default&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 19445&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />224.0.0.0/3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; default&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1691&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />10.1.1.0/24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; default&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24790&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />192.168.1.0/24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;default&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 843K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />192.168.2.0/24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;default&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 718K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Active rules:<br />source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; proto&nbsp; src-port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dest-port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hits&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0.0.0.0/0.0.0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0/0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; 0:65535&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wan_wan2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8913&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />0.0.0.1/0.0.0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0/0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; 0:65535&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;443&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wan2_wan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6494&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />0.0.0.0/0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0/0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; balanced&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 79855</p><p>Both members in balanced policy have same metric and different weight (10 for wan and 20 for wan2).<br />Where is the catch?</p><p>P.S. i change policy order and i put balanced policy first. Now seem that wan2 got more traffic than wan, wich make me happy but is weird.<br />Is important policy order? From documentation don&#039;t result that.<br />My default rule for all traffic use balanced policy.<br />I think that is important rule order, not policy order.</p><p>Any opinion?</p>									</div>

					<p>The load sharing is based upon new connections, not on size. So say for instance you have 100 sessions, but only 2 of them are large downloads. It would be perfectly possible for the two large downloads to traverse the wan with a lower weight.</p><p>Policy order is not a concern. The only thing important is rule order.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adze</strong> on 16 Sep 2014, 21:15)</p>

					<p>Hi... I have some question about mwan3, I configure mwan3 on my TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1 with OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) using 3 fiber line @ 20mbps each, i load balance it 33% each link. doing bandwidth test, I get nearly 60mbps, but recently I upgraded the 3 fiber lines to 100mbps each, so I&#039;m expecting to get 300mbps during bandwidth test, but sadly i only get 100mbps, I cant go beyond 100mbps, I test the link individually directly to my compute and I can get 100mbps for each fiber line... upon checking the realtime graph on my openwrt the traffic graph for each link is @ 33mbps or less, maybe because of the load balance value of 33%. I wonder why before when my link is&nbsp; @ 20mbps each, I can utilize the full bandwidth of each 20mbps fiber, while now that I&#039;m @ 100mbps, I only get 33% of the 100mbps of each link. It seems that mwan3 is really limited to 100mbps, Please help how I can utilize all my 3 100mbps lnk, thank you...</p>									</div>
