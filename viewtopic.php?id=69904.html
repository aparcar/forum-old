					<p><strong>Ok, let&#039;s see if we can&#039;t solve this...</strong></p><p>Please let me know, are you running a 64-Bit OS to compile on?

It says you are using <em>i386</em> when you mentioned you were compiling for 64-Bit.</strong></p><p><strong>I suspect you need to add the 64-Bit toolchain.</strong></p><p>Please refer to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a> - specifically these steps:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>run make menuconfig and set &quot;Target System&quot;, &quot;Subtarget&quot;, &quot;Target Profile&quot;;<br />run make defconfig;<br />run make menuconfig and modify set of package;<br />run scripts/diffconfig.sh &gt;mydiffconfig (save your changes in the text file mydiffconfig);<br />run make V=s (build OpenWRT with console logging, you will look where build failed.).</p></blockquote></div><p>So you start with #1.

					<p>mys5droid, in contrast to your example of bad security practices (which is entails changing one single line in a configfile[1]), however adding a new architecture/ platform to OpenWrt isn&#039;t done in 1-2-3 steps, but rather entails changes in many places (wiggling the buildsystem around, adding kernel patches and coming up with a suitable kernel config, adding defconfigs for all required targets, dealing with all the fallout with packages expecting all x86 to be 32 bit only). Even for someone who knows what he/ she is doing, this will be hard work for roundabout a weekend[2], at least - work that has already been done, just not for barrier breaker, but later releases instead (chaos calmer and later in particular). Even those who did add x86_64 platform support somewhere between 2012 and 2015 won&#039;t get a backport to barrier breaker done much faster than that, because the project as a whole and the way things are hooked up into the buildsystem has evolved since then, so forgetting the current/ modern ways and re-learning the old ways is both frustrating (&quot;damned, it could be done so much easier today&quot;) but also time consuming.</p><p>Now you need to put all this effort into perspective with the &quot;advantages&quot; doing all this work for the userbase at large (which would be anyone beyond just one person, consisting of merely jbccjb):<br />- any device capable to run x86_64 can run chaos calmer or trunk/ designated driver with ease, so there is no hard technical need why the current code (both stable and devel) won&#039;t work on the target device in question.<br />- OpenWrt for 32 bit/ x86, which was already present in barrier breaker, will also work on any x86_64 device, which allows testing for potential regressions between barrier breaker and chaos calmer. This might not be the optimal solution, but it does work - yes, i386 might not run on some of the most recent UEFI-only x86_64, but kernel 3.3 won&#039;t run on those either - so barrier breaker isn&#039;t an option for those systems anyways.<br />- development on the barrier breaker branch has stopped years ago (roughly around the time chaos calmer was released, but it probably stalled way before that already), the branch is closed for development. This means even if someone would actually do all the work to prepare all the patches to add x86_64 support for barrier breaker, no one would even bother to commit it to the barrier breaker branch[3] - making this a rather involved &quot;contract work&quot; for a single person[4], but not the public at large</p><p>Requesting help for simple things is easy, you usually get some responses easily or at least some pointers to potential documentation, but the topic in questions isn&#039;t easy at all. Walking someone with no experience[5] through this in many small steps going back and forth would take even longer (if it succeeds at all) than just doing it yourself, but that isn&#039;t anything one could do in a spare minute while being bored[6], on the contrary. So expecting help of the detailed kind requested here, is quite bold and rather unlikely to happen, considering the effort required and the fact that it has already been done for the subsequent stable release. There is a reason why development for larger new features is done on the development code base, rarely backported to the last/ current stable branch and basically never to long obsoleted, EOLed, past release branches, because spending significant amounts of effort twice or more is frustrating and needs quite some reasonable justification.</p><p>[1] which one however depends on the display manager you&#039;re using - so the explanations &quot;just&quot; explodes to the syntax for the five major options (there are more display manager around, but lightdm, gdm2, gdm3, kdm and sddm are the most common ones).<br />[2] and this needs to be all completed and done in the dry, before you can even do a first test.<br />[3] which also takes quite some effort on the part of the committer, to review said changes at least superficially &lt;-- this is the only place where the security aspect actually matters, because adding completely new features (and new platform support is a pretty large new feature) doesn&#039;t make the slightest sense for an EOLed branch abandoned years ago, which hasn&#039;t seen even the most trivial security support since that time.<br />[4] who hasn&#039;t provided the slightest reason why barrier breaker is needed, rather than just taking the current code.<br />[5] otherwise the question wouldn&#039;t be as generic like this one, but much more specific - ESR&#039;s essay about <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">smart questions </a> comes to mind.<br />[6] I do indeed consider two man-days (more than 16 hours) to be a reasonable estimate for someone who knows what he/ she is doing, this is not a pointless exaggeration - yes, x86_64 in general isn&#039;t much of a problem on the major general purpose desktop distributions since 2004/ 2005, but that doesn&#039;t mean it wouldn&#039;t be difficult to add a new architecture to a make-world based buildsystem like OpenWrt (don&#039;t forget the cross-compiler aspect).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 25 Feb 2017, 05:41)</p>
