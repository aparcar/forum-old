I am currently using the following firmware, OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)&nbsp; I have tried changing it&nbsp; Network -&gt; interfaces -&gt; Wan -&gt; advanced settings... unchecking use dns advertised and inputting my own in custom. This didn&#039;t work..I have rebooted, flushed dns on my machines..&nbsp; I also put dns servers under dhcp and dns&nbsp; in dns forwardings....I also tried editing the /etc/config/dhcp file... None of these worked. Is there something I am missing... ?&nbsp; Trying to use opendns servers.. </p><p>Please&nbsp; help if you can.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>try <strong>/tmp/resolve.conf.auto</strong> (make sure it has <strong>auto</strong> on the end and not just conf, both are present in that folder)<br />but it will reset on boot, not sure how to set it permanently, thats the file i use anyway for pushing my vpn&#039;s dns</p><p>you could also try /etc/resolv.conf but irc i think i might have had problems making that persistent aswell<br />also i think /etc/config/network might be another place to set it, using &#039;option dns 8.8.8.8&#039; under one of your networks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>burphur</strong> on 24 Aug 2015, 08:50)</p>

					<p>Maverik1, just as an FYI, I&#039;ve been doing it the first way that you mentioned, and it works fine...on Chaos Calmer. I&#039;m almost positive that it did on BB too, but I can&#039;t recall now.</p><p>Maybe it&#039;s a bug that&#039;s been fixed, or maybe there&#039;s another variable.</p>									</div>
