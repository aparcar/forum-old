					<p>I have travelled through openwrt documentation but still haven&#039;t found the solution for my question. Actually, what I want is disabling NAT in openwrt. So my WRT54G will operate as a hub, just forward the packet from internal link to the uplink without modifying the source and destination ip address in the packet. However, I still want to keep my WRT54G operating as a DHCP server. Somebody please help me!</p>									</div>

					<p>What is your need exactly:<br />- Do you want to remove only NAT (and keep routing between switch ports + wireless and WAN interface<br />- Or you want all ports (including WAN port) as a member of the switch ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>snip</strong> on 30 Nov 2005, 12:26)</p>
