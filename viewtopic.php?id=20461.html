					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using an LX800 board that runs OpenWrt. I have my own webinterface. Via this web interface I upload a complete ext2 image.<br />I write this image to the compact flash card by using the dd command, just the same like I do it when I would put the compact flash card in the card reader of my host dev. system.</p><p>This is what my upgrade script does:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/tmp/bin/openwrt-x86-ext2.image of=/dev/hdb
reboot -nf</code></pre></div><p>The image got written, but for some reason the rootfs is corrupt. Some init files show only ^@ characters.<br />However when I use dd from my host dev system via card reader, than the board boots normal and filesystem is OK.</p><p>Is there anything I should do before writing the image on my target system?</p><p>BTW: the image is copied over via web interface as a tgz file which is than decompressed in the /tmp folder.</p><p>Any hint is welcome<br />Thx</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />it sounds weird to me that you&#039;re writing on the FS while you&#039;re running on it. May be you could boot from another FS before ?</p>									</div>
