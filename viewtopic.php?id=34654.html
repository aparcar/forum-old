					<p>Hi, I used to connect directly to a full duplex 100 Mbit university switch and when downloading a torrent, this torrent would download with at least 5Mbps and seed with at least 3 Mbps. It would have a positive share ratio within the first 5 minutes. Also max speeds 10 - 11Mbps occur often for both incoming and outgoing traffic.</p><p>Since I&#039;m using a WRT160NL router with OpenWrt, i download with 2 Mbps and upload barely with about 1 - 40 Kbps. </p><p>anyone any tips?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trendpoinder2</strong> on 11 Feb 2012, 08:49)</p>

					<p>Which torrent client are you using? Have you tried torrents with a high ratio of seeds:peers?&nbsp; I run Transmission on my Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH and I can pull my connection&#039;s 10mbps max no problem with torrents that have a lot of download bandwidth in the swarm.</p>									</div>

					<p>The client I&#039;m using did not change and is Utorrent ( I need a client with outgoing encryption) and I&#039;m using a private torrent-site, so the seeds are limited to a few hundred, but I don&#039;t see how this matters as I&#039;m comparing the situation from before and after placing the router in between. <br />Also I&#039;m not planning to place a torrent-client in the router itself, I like to manage that on my PC.</p><p>So i have an unchanged OS, with unchanged torrent-software and an unchanged pool of seeds over an unchanged connection.&nbsp; <br />Atm most of the torrents die at 0.2 ratio and only achieve close to 1:1 ratios after days online if at all, whereas normally without router, I would have a 1:3 ratio within minutes after finishing myself.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trendpoinder2</strong> on 15 Feb 2012, 17:10)</p>

					<p>Make sure that you have not limited speeds in QoS settings too much.<br />Also ensure that your port-forwarding settings are ok.</p><p>I am using wndr3700 with Openwrt and can easily achive over 60 Mbit/s down and 5 Mbit/s upstream with speedy torrents, pretty much what my connection allows. So, Openwrt itself is not the limitation.</p>									</div>
