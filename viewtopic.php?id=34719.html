					<p>Hi! I&#039;m new to compiling OpenWRT, and while I&#039;ve not had any trouble so far, is there support for the switch (RTL8367M) for the n56u? If so, is it automatially built-in or included with something? There&#039;s a section that specifies which kmod I want to build in, but I don&#039;t see RTL8367M anywhere.</p><p>Also, are there any special methods for installing this, or is it safe to do it straight through the stock web gui?</p><p>Sorry for so many questions, but any help is greatly appreciated. If I can be of any help in further developing for this, please let me know.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>h3xis</strong> on 7 Mar 2012, 18:33)</p>
