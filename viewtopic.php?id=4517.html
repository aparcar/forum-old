					<p>Hi.</p><p>In the <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16">bugtracker</a> nbd states that wep is broken for the new driver and that nas needs to be implemented.<br />Does this mean that no encryption (excluding solutions such as VPNs, SSH-tunnels etc) can be used when using this feature?</p><p>If yes, is there any work in progress on this? OpenWRT supports everything I need exept this, and I would really like to use it. Makes my life easier and I could use lesser hardware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Is everyone here clueless about this topic?</p><p>I am buiding a wireless ISP (wireless backbone, wired and wireless clients) and this feature would help alot. I can (and will, where I need more bandwith) use several AP&#039;s at the same location trunked togheter with a network cable where one AP is dedicated for backbone links and the other serves wireless clients.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have, I&#039;ve spent days doing research about this question. It accually raised more questions than answers in the long run. The bugtracker has the best information yet and telling from it&#039;s information I would guess there is no progress beeing done on this (driver and integrate it) new future. But it&#039;s still a guess, therefore this thread.</p>									</div>
