					<p>That must be a very simple thing to do but I can&#039;t seem to find any information about it.</p><p>I have looked at luci and sysupgrade methods but I could only find instructions about downloading a prebuilt image. Not about building your own.</p><p>So I would like to know the instructions for upgrading OpenWrt with my own image. <br />So far I have built an image with make menuconfig and make. That has not produced any factory or sysupgrade file.</p><p>I have tried to give the .bin file to luci for upgrade with the keep settings option ticked and its answer was: <br />The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform. </p><p>So I have tried to follow the wiki instructions on how to convert .bin to .trx but when trying again with the new file I got the same error message from luci.</p><p>So please can anyone explain how to produce the factory and sysupgrade files (what difference is there?). And also how to use them for upgrade. I don&#039;t mind not ticking the keep settings box if it makes things easier, but I would like to understand how that works.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no difference in flashing a &quot;prebuilt&quot; release/snapshot image or a self-built image.</p><p>Most likely you have included too many packages and the firmware would be too large for your flash memory. In that case the make fails rather silently. Reduce the number of included packages. Preferably start with the plain default for your device and if succesful, then add a few packages at a time.</p><p>For most routers the basic image is &quot;sysupgrade&quot; and that is used when upgrading from an existing Openwrt build. &quot;factory&quot; image contains additionally the necessary header to allow the router&#039;s native OEM flashing routine to accept the Openwrt image as a genuine firmware.</p><p>There are some differences for some chipsets/targets, so check the Openwrt wiki page for your device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Start with an empty .config file (delete an existing one, if you have one). Then only select your architecture and the correct device. That selects the correct defaults for your device. There should be no need to touch any of the other build options (like image types etc.) unless you really know what you do.</p><p>Which device you are talking about? Is it normally supported in Openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Sep 2016, 12:29)</p>

					<p>Default image is built. I have tried to feed luci with the openwrt-ar71xx-mikrotik-vmlinux.bin and the answer is:<br />The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format.

					<p>In the docs I found that probably I&#039;m missing *-factory.bin and *-sysupgrade.bin.<br />And indeed that could be due to an image too big as hnyman said.<br />But yet, I have ditched my environment and started fresh by compiling the default profile for my router without adding any packet and that does not create said files either.<br />For the moment I don&#039;t understand.</p>									</div>

					<p>You still haven&#039;t mentioned the router model. Mikrotik something?</p><p>And you might be mixing RAM memory and flash memory. 128 MB is likely RAM while flash might only be 2 or 4 MB. Some routers can only take an older smaller release as Linux kernel has grown in size.</p><p>And yes, you need the factory and sysupgrade images. They are the actual firmwares.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Sep 2016, 16:31)</p>
