					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have upgraded a WRT54GL that I have from White Russian to Kamikaze.</p><p>Everything is fine except my wireless printer, an HP 5850, which doesn&#039;t want to join the WLAN using WPA at all. When I open the network, it joins without problems. I had this printer running over WPA using White Russian without problems, so I am left scratching my head how can I debug what is going on and if there might be any incompatibility with Kamikaze.</p><p>Any suggestions on how to start to solve this conundrum would be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
