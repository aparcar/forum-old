					<p>&quot;general&quot; is for most routers, while &quot;nand&quot; is for those (new) routers with NAND flash.<br />The add-on packages you refer to are most likely identical. The difference in mainly in the actual firmware binaries.</p><p>In BB14.07 only a few &quot;nand&quot; routers exist with ar71xx architecture. See ar71xx image Makefile from 1306 onward:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/barrier_breaker/target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile#L1306">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branche … file#L1306</a><br />WNDR3700V4, WNDR4300V1, NBG6716</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 24 Mar 2015, 21:17)</p>

					<p>Yes, I&#039;m aware of the different types of flash memory, resulting in different firmware images.</p><p>What I&#039;m curious about are the packages. Looking at their sizes, the packages in ar71xx/generic/packages/packages and ar71xx/nand/packages/packages do not seem to be identical.</p><p>I have a Netgear WNDR3800 (NOR) and a Netgear WNDR4300 (NAND). Do I really have to make different packages for those two? Or can use the same local repository for both routers?</p>									</div>

					<p>I looked at the files in the packages folders and the file sizes differ only by a few bytes for most packages. As the *.ipk files are compressed, I think that the difference comes from different timestamps etc. leading into slightly different compression results.</p><p>There seems to be one actual difference: nand profile declares support for rtc. That may have some impact on some packages.<br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=blob;f=target/linux/ar71xx/nand/target.mk;hb=HEAD">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a … mk;hb=HEAD</a></p><p>I think that despite the small *.ipk size differences, 99% of the packages are identical inside. Then there is the one percent, which either is related to flash handling or uses real-time clock (which all nand devices apparently are supposed to contain, which is hard to believe). But you have no real way to know, which are really different.</p><p>I would say that for normal user-space packages, you can use the same repo.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 25 Mar 2015, 10:30)</p>

					<p>I ran a quick test on the packages that are included in ImageBuilder&#039;s default profile for a WNDR4300.
