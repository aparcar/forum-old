					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>first of all, let me introduce myself and my situation : I&#039;m a web developper who has a personnal website which I maintain through a SVN. I have to move next month to another flat, and I will have to choose another IPS. One propose a much smaller price to have only a line, with no modem at all. I thought that I can merge my 2 needs (modem + SVN server), and a friend of mine advice me to use OpenWRT. I read a bit the docs, and Here is my question :</p><p>Which modem should I use for Internet Access and an SVN server ?</p><p>I read there is no &quot;best model&quot; so, In my case, I have just no idea, so that I decided to ask directly on the forum.</p><p>I hope I&#039;m clear enough, don&#039;t hesitate to ask me questions.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>NainzguL</p>									</div>
