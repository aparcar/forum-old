					<p>I&#039;ve successfully loaded the latest WhiteRussian build on my WRT54G and have set it up in bridged client mode as per the ClientModeHowTo.&nbsp; Everything is working, in so far as devices plugged into the lan ports can connect to the internet router and pull an IP address via DHCP, etc.&nbsp; BUT, the communication only seems to be uni-directional.&nbsp; I cannot connect back to any devices on the bridge side from clients of my main access point.&nbsp; My intended use for this is to connect an ethernet capable laser printer to my wifi network.&nbsp; The printer pulls an IP and I can see it as a client of my primary access point, but printing doesn&#039;t work and I can&#039;t access the printer&#039;s web status page.&nbsp; I thought it might be a firewall issue, so I disabled the firewall script in /etc/init.d but still no dice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am not a network engineer so I need some help.&nbsp; Any ideas on what else I might need to do?&nbsp; Or, if you need more info, what do you need?</p><p>I had another thought, which I haven&#039;t tried yet...&nbsp; I remember from hacking my TiVo that I had to disable iptables before I could connect to it, perhaps I need to disable iptables in OpenWrt as well?</p><p>Thanks a bunch, in advance, for any advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>if it pulls an IP address from DHCP, can you ping it?</p><p>not being able to access the web admin console for your printer is not a good sign... i would expect it is something to do with your firewall.user file or perhaps your iptables settings.&nbsp; disabling your firewall is a no-no in most cases, but if you are behind another router with a firewall than it should be fine.</p><p>to kill your firewall you may want to type &#039;ps&#039; to see which programs are running, and then issue a &#039;kill -9 (pid)&#039; to disable it.&nbsp; i&#039;ve found that the init.d folder is extremely unhelpful (in my experience)</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, this will be connecting to another access point which is behind a firewall, so I&#039;m not too worried about killing it.&nbsp; How do I permanently disable the firewall?&nbsp; Killing it with a ps / kill is all well and good, but if the router gets rebooted...&nbsp; As to answer the ping question, no, I cannot ping it.&nbsp; I get &quot;no route to host&quot; and &quot;host is down&quot; messages.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought I might have it.&nbsp; I disabled the firewall again, by replacing both iptables and firewall.user with a simple shell script that does an exit 0 (a little trick I learned in my tivo hacking).&nbsp; I was able to ping the printer and access its web page after that, but actually printing didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I rebooted the printer (but not the router), just for fun, and although it once again pulled an IP from DHCP, I could no longer ping it or hit the web page.&nbsp; I guess I still need help...</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I give up.&nbsp; I think I may have something wrong with the printer now, though it was working before I started messing with this stuff.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; I tried a commercial wifi bridge, and I can access it&#039;s config menu and anything else attached to it, but not the printer.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
