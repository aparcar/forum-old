					<p>Thank you davidc502!</p><p>Just flashed your build (wrt1200ac), so far so good: <br />2.4 on channel 4 (currently at 108mbps link)<br />5.0 on channel 149 (Currently at 866.7 mbps link)<br />both using forced AES</p><p>I will let you know in a couple days (if I make it that far) what my speeds are like.

					<p>@mrfrezee</p><p>If you just update crypto.mk to include the new marvell-cesa driver and select it, it is in the kernel as a built-in.&nbsp; I added CONFIG_CRYPTO_MARVELL_CESA=m in the mvebu config-4.4 file, and this then builds it as a loadable module and you get the ko.&nbsp; For good measure you likely want to make sure that the line for the MV_CESA module &quot;is not set&quot;.</p><p>I have gotten &quot;acceleration&quot; on both md5 and sha1... but I&#039;m not convinced it&#039;s actually working.&nbsp; marvell-cesa should be shown as the module in /proc/crypto (I believe) and I&#039;m not seeing that.</p><p>The module can be built and auto-loaded, but I haven&#039;t figured out how to actually put it to use.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if module load order is important or if there are other dependencies missing (or incorrectly included such that they&#039;re overriding desired behavior).</p><p>Also, there may be a bug in the Makefile for cryptodev.&nbsp; There is an &quot;autoload&quot; line that fires it up at &quot;50&quot; and an install line that includes an autoload at &quot;80&quot;.&nbsp; They both end up loading the same module so only the 50 will take effect.&nbsp; Not sure which one is the one we want.</p>									</div>

					<p>@InkblotAdmirer, @mrfrezee<br />In doing a new build for 4.4.7 I took another look at the CESA device and <a href="http://pastebin.com/T9DVDcf5">here</a> is where I am at. A little bit closer, but still not quite.</p><p>On page 174 of the first PDF on this <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=site:www.marvell.com+cesa&amp;btnG=Search&amp;gws_rd=cr,ssl&amp;ei=M7sOV7iDH4ewjgTJv6L4AQ">page</a> are listed what the CESA device supports. I ran <em>make kernel_menuconfig</em> and in Cryptographic API selected everything that the device supports as documented in the PDF, as well as the <em>Hardware crypto devices</em> near the bottom. I had to build in the foreground as there are some &quot;NEW&quot; defines, and &quot;oldconfig&quot; did not get the job done. Builds and packages the .ko file, and the module is in the /proc/crypto file.</p><p>I think there also needs to be an equivalent patch for this device as provided by:<br /><em>target/linux/generic/patches-4.4/252-mv_cesa_depends.patch</em></p><p>Edit:<br />As noted CONFIG_CRYPTO_MARVELL_CESA has to be &quot;=m&quot; not &quot;y&quot; for the .ko to be generated.</p><p>Edit2:<br />My Kconfig does not have <em>select CRYPTO_HASH2</em> in the MARVELL_CESA section.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anomeome</strong> on 14 Apr 2016, 05:16)</p>
