					<p>Hi,<br />i am using a fritzbox as main router and tp-link archer c7 as a repeater with relayd. Is working fine, until you have the need for IPV6 over the bridge. I used in the past time Windows 7 with the homegroup functionality,&nbsp; and it was working fine over relayd. With Windows 10 no chance, it seems the Windows 10 uses more ipv6 for homegroups functionality . In other words, i am not able to use homegroup functionality with Windows 10 over relayd. When my PC&#039;s are connected directly to the main router wired and via wlan, homegroups appears.<br />Therefor i am looking for a solution.<br />I have already tried igmpproxy, no success.<br />Gargoyle is not usable for me, because a need perl on my repeater, for a little application.<br />WDS is not possible, because the fritzbox haven&#039;t WDS.</p><p>I am interested in your solution !!<br />How have you fixed that in your enviroment ? </p><p>best regards<br />Klaus</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Rampler</strong> on 30 Jan 2016, 10:12)</p>

					<p>Thanks RangerZ,<br />I have seen this already, this is the RELAYD solution..., which i use ..<br />I am surprised, that so few people using Windows homegroups via relayd. I am also surprised that the only solution for that issue is using WDS. <br />Nevertheless it would nice to know, if the Windows homegroup feature is useful by other openwrt users via relayd.</p>									</div>

					<p>why is this suprising? <br />WDS is the only solution which gives you a fully transparent layer2-bridge. </p><p>If you use any pseudobrigde-setup you will get in all sorts of trouble, and you will have to figure out which broadcasts relayd isn&#039;t passing. </p><p>I don&#039;t think this applies to windows 7/8/10 but there was something called WINS-Server back in the days to allow communication between windows machines that aren&#039;t in the same broadcastdomain. Active Directory switched to DNS for this purpose, so maybe that&#039;s a possible way to go (?) or maybe you should run samba as PDC on your openwrt-box <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 2 Feb 2016, 18:46)</p>
