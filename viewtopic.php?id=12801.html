					<p>Hi, I&#039;m trying to build a 7.09 image&nbsp; for the ASUS WL-700gE. This router is listed as WIP on the table of hardware, however it&#039;s actual page says:</p><p>Kamikaze has support for this device. However, since you need to fit OpenWrt to internal flash (2MB) it&#039;s quite limited on features.</p><p>and </p><p>in the forum their is a posting(http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4883&amp;p=3) that says: </p><p>JUST BUILD FRESH KAMIKAZE AS SUPPORT IS BUILT IN NOW</p><p>So It seems that it should work, However after checking out the lastest 7.09 source and using make menuconfig to set the proper target the image that make builds does not respond to ping/telnet or even turn the lights on when restarted (after waiting a generous amount of time).</p><p>I&#039;ve been hunting around here, on&nbsp; <a href="http://wl500g.info">http://wl500g.info</a>/ and on <a href="http://wl700g.homelinux.net">http://wl700g.homelinux.net</a>&nbsp; and I can&#039;t seem to find a recent image (within the last year or so) that seems to work, that makes me think that something has changed that makes the resulting image no longer function for the WL-700gE. </p><p>The last image that I&#039;ve found that works is located here: <a href="http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=8188">http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=8188</a> though it&#039;s about a year old as best as I can tell. Any help on getting a newer image working would be very much appreciated.</p><p>-William Voorhees</p>									</div>
