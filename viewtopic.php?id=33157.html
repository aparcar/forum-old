					<p>hey,</p><p>i bought a few weeks ago the cheap TP-Link WR941ND v2/v3 at amazon, it runs well with OEM firmware, but i missed the port forwarding ability</p><p>first i build it from source, then used imagebuilder but decided to choose the safest way and downloaded openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr941nd-v2-squashfs-factory.bin from your webserver and flashed OpenWRT 10.03.1rc6</p><p>OpenWRT run, could access the router over Webserver via LAN, enabled Wifi, could connect to the WLAN, but didn&#039;t get an IP from the DHCP for my WLAN-Interface on the Notebook<br />so, I experimented a little bit with the configuration and messed it up <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I was in the interfaces tab .... there were eth0, wan, lan and unmanaged (selcted with the radio button) ... so i selected eth0, save &amp; apply ... that was it, kicked myself out <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>today i tried to get into failsafe mode, there is a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr941nd#failsafe.mode">instruction in the wiki of tp-link wr941nd</a>, but not tested by the author ... so first problem, there&#039;s no DMZ LED on my router, so i tried the <a href="https://http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">generic failsafe</a> way hammering the qss button for one minute from power on, the sys led ist blinking, but if i try to telnet 192.168.1.1 putty quits with no error message</p><p><strong>is there a way to get into failsafe mode or otherwise access the router?</strong></p>									</div>

					<p>thx for the hint with wireshark, but unfortunately it doesn&#039;t [s]work[/s] help<br />i got the broadcast frame from 192.168.1.1, so i pressed qss button and the router seems to get into failsafe, cause wifi isnt running and sys led is flashing (i had that before, by hammering one button at startup), but cant ping or telnet 192.168.1.1<br />so i tried it again with pressing reset button and tried again pressing one button from power on for a while, everytime same result - sys led flashing, no wifi but no ping or telnet, too<br />if i dont press any button at startup, wifi will be up, so i find the WLAN, can connect, but dont get a IP</p><p>am i missing something?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>keili</strong> on 25 Nov 2011, 23:31)</p>
