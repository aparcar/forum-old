					<p>From the Wiki entry for the WR850G, one may deduce that all hardware versions are equally supported by OpenWRT.<br />Searching the forum, I learned that there may be issues with older hw&#039;s though - I&#039;ve got a v1 (the one with the two-part power cord).<br />What&#039;s the current status, and is there a way to convert existing &#039;config.bin&#039; backup files to &#039;nvram show&#039;-output style so I can<br />check the previous settings?<br />Since the v1 is based on bcm94710dev (or even 4702) I think it has to be handled separately - in particular the &#039;default firmware<br />setting&#039; differ from v2 and later. I could not find this in the OpenWRT code (yet)... could someone in the know please take my hand?<br />Thanks, S.</p>									</div>
