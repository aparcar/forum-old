					<p>We already know.</p><p>The WRT54GS was designed based on the WRT54G v2.0, now with WRT54G v2.2 we have a new WRT54GS v1.1.

					<p>I just bought a new 54g 2.2 so I could use it to expiriment with OpenWRT.&nbsp; I noted that on LinkSys&#039;s webpage they state that with the WRTG2.2 you cannot use earlier versions of the firmware.</p><p>So just before I downloaded my build of linksys&#039;s 3.1.3 source, I double checked the firmware that came with the 2.2 router.&nbsp; and well the numbers are actually different.&nbsp; It seems that the preloaded firmware on the 2.2 router shows version 3.3.1 , yet the current release of source and binary both show 3.1.3.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3.3.1 is showing a date in sept 04.</p><p>Umm..&nbsp; &nbsp;Anybody else notice this?&nbsp; Do I have to wait for linksys to release 3.3.1 ?&nbsp; Is it a typo????</p>									</div>

					<p>I recently received a V2.2 WRT54G and decided to dig around inside it a bit.</p><p>There are a number of differences between the V2.0 and V2.2 hardware. The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of differences I&#039;ve been able to spot.</p><p>The v2.2 unit I have doesn&#039;t seem to use the ADMTek switch controller. It has a chip labeled BCM5325EKQM, manufactured by Broadcom instead of the ADMtek controller.</p><p>A single ram chip is now where the normal V2.0 units&#039; dual ram chips used to sit, labeled &quot;Hynix 432A&quot;, so I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s a 32Mb chip. (V2.0 units had 2 ram chips afaik)</p><p>CPU is the usual BCM4712 (LKFB) but in an extremely TINY form factor. It&#039;s almost half the size of the V2.0 CPU. (The original V2 hardware I have uses the BCM4712KPB)</p><p>The flash chip looks pretty much like the same standard Intel Flash as the V2.0&#039;s have, though I can&#039;t be sure of the size.</p><p>The pin headers seem basically unchanged, except that they&#039;ve moved around on the board and both headers are now next to each other.</p><p>There&#039;s two extra coils and two extra capacitors, presumably due to changes required to power the new BCM switch chip.</p><p>The WAN Ethernet, and Radio seem unchanged, except that the track layout is slightly different.</p><p>My digital camer is pretty poor, but I&#039;ll try to get some pictures up soon.</p><p>So, what do you think the verdict is? Should I try and tftp flash it? I&#039;m pretty sure the switch will die, which is fine for my purposes as I only need a single workable ethernet.</p><p>Have they released the GPL code for 3.03.1 (which is what the firmware&#039;s web interface reports) yet?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, that&#039;s just the W54G/W54S difference. mjn3&#039;s addpattern only does the GS header, which is why the current openwrt buildprocess uses SED to hack it to produce both a openwrt-g-code.bin and openwrt-gs-code.bin</p><p>I&#039;ve adpatterned an openwrt-linux.trx using the addpattern utility that comes with the 3.x build system and the router now accepts the flash via HTTP, or tftp.</p><p>Only problem is that it appears the switch is dead (which is to be expected) and the router is unhappy with the image. Sits and blinks power/dmz constantly. I recovered with the pin 15/16 shorting trick, and re-tftping with the original linksys firmware brings it back to life.</p><p>Sigh.

The new snapshot I&#039;ve created works fine with the rest of my v2.0 WRT&#039;s and the switch appears to work fine.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;d be more than willing to give your snapshot a shot.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;ll go back and purchase back my old unit, lol.</p>									</div>
