					<p>I&#039;ve set up a wireless bridge via relayd on a secondary router according to the routed client with pseudobridge mechanism described in the this link: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><p>Everything is working fine. <br />My main router is a WZR-HP-AG300H and the secondary is a Netgear WNDR3700v2.</p><p>I have only one problem.<br />I&#039;ve set up my main router to broadcast on channel 3 on the 2.4 ghz band with 40mhz spectrum width (channel above) and its working like it should.<br />My Station router (Netgear) connects to the main router in 40Mhz bandwidth mode however, the clients that connect to the Netgear DO NOT connect to anything higher than 65Mbps even though its capabilities show 300Mbps in inSSider.</p><p>Can someone enlighten me as to what could be causing this issue?</p><p>Thanks,<br />C</p>									</div>

Even if I force both the routers to 40Mhz (option in LUCI) the netgear won&#039;t do it (probably because its on the same channel?)..<br />I should note, if it wasn&#039;t already obvious, that the netgear connects in client mode to the main router and it is also broadcasting the same ssid on the same channel (with the same PSK2 passphrase).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chhatc</strong> on 31 Dec 2012, 12:03)</p>

					<p>Also,</p><p>Is is possible to set up the same thing (routed client mode with relayd pseudobridge) over the 5Ghz radio on the netgear along with the 2.4Ghz wifi routed client with repeater. I tried this after setting up the 2.4ghz setup, however the netgear router became unresponsive after doing so.</p><p>Thanks<br />C</p>									</div>
