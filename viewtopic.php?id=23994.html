					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>Hopefully someone can offer me some advise on this router, as I&#039;d like to start making more use of it.</p><p>The Tecom AH2322W was distributed in Spain by Tele2, and I was given one recently. The stock firmware was not brilliant, and certainly the VoIP facilities were very limited.</p><p>The CPU is labelled as a Broadcom BCM6358VKFBG, which I understand is an SOC, integrating MIPS CPU, ADSL, VoIP and USB. There are also WiFi extensions in it as far as I know, and thats backed up by a BCM4318KFBG chip on the main board (not a daughter card) and that shows up with an lspci. The board ID shows as a 96358VW.</p><p>There is one external USB B port, which was used to connect a PC over usbnet, there are 2 LAN ports, a line in (FXO) and a line out (FXS). There is a 4mb flash (actually I think the physical chip is 8mb), and there is 32mb memory.</p><p>I&#039;d like to achieve a few things and wondered if anyone can offer any pointers please?</p><p>I&#039;ve flashed it with openwrt-96358GW-squashfs-dsl2740b-cfe.bin, and it boots fine. There is no ADSL, but as I understand it, Broadcom have not GPL&#039;d their ADSL drivers? I have a spare modem, so thats not a concern. Eth1 picks up an IP address from the DHCP server on the LAN, and I have installed and accessed Luci. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried installing kmod-usb-uhci and kmod-usb2. Both install and insmod, and I can see they are loaded. lsusb shows no devices connected though, and neither the (self powered) hub or devices on it wake up. A quick dmesg shows 2 ports detected, so any ideas why nothing is being detected on them?</p><p>Also, I really want to get the VoIP functions running, obviously I&#039;d like to pivot boot at some point and use the USB disk as root so I can fit Asterisk on, but at the moment I&#039;d be happy to have Asterisk on another machine on the network with the Tecom just providing FXO/FXS services over the network. Should I be looking at anything in particular to get these ports operating?</p><p>Many thanks for any help you can come up with, it&#039;s really appreciated,</p><p>Ian B</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello! Hola!</p><p>Thank you for your post! I was able to flash my tecom with openwrt too! I used the same firmware image you used. What&#039;s the name of the file for the latest firmware for this device! Since there is new distribution sure that there are improvements and maybe we can make the usb work! It&#039;d be great to use it, togeter with the voip ports.</p><p>Thanks! Gracias!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cotarelo</strong> on 5 Feb 2012, 02:51)</p>

					<p>Hi! Â¡Hola!</p><p>Today, while looking for another thing, I&#039;ve seen the AH2322W at a second hand shop. It was quite cheap but I didn&#039;t get it.</p><p>I wonder if you could tell me wether the flash memory is 4MB or 8MB. Maybe you can write the name of the chip here.</p><p>Finally, if the router is supported, you could add it to the OpenWrt wiki. First create the the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tecom/ah2322w">AH2322W</a> page and then add it to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">Table of Hardware</a>. There are templates for doing it.</p><p>Regards,</p>									</div>

					<p>I did a wrong configuration in OpenWRT (client mode) and now I can&#039;t access to the router (don&#039;t get dhcp, can&#039;t ping the router, don&#039;t know the IP). Is there any way I can reset it? Seems that reset button does not work</p>									</div>
