					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to use net2kiss to do some ax.25 plumbing. I can&#039;t seem to figure out how it wants to name ptys, and don&#039;t really understand what White Russian does with the master/slave pairs.</p><p>When I look in /dev/pty, I see a zillion files. When I look in /dev/pts, I only see a few, and they&#039;re named differently.</p><p>I&#039;ve read about /dev/ptmx. As best I can tell, the net2kiss that is compiled for the WRT doesn&#039;t understand this convention/mechanism. Is there some utility I can use to create the ptys I need and pass them around to the programs that need them?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Or ... is there some way to get OpenWRT to use old-style ptys? Does WhiteRussian have &quot;legacy pty&quot; support turned on? Is there a MAKEDEV that will create them?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cak</strong> on 19 Jul 2007, 00:53)</p>
