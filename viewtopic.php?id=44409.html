					<p>I followed the instruction here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37746">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=37746</a></p><p>I used to get error -16 in the link above but it went away after I removed the led and buttons module. It turned out that GPIO 0 was used by something else and hence the error -16 error.</p><p>And here is my dmesg log:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   57.680000] gpio-mmc: Failed to request mmc_spi module.
[   57.700000] spi-gpio spi-gpio.0: master is unqueued, this is deprecated
[   57.710000] gpio-mmc: MMC-Card &quot;default&quot; attached to GPIO pins di=9, do=13, clk=8, cs=0</code></pre></div><p>It looks like it does not do anything further to detect my SD card. I&#039;m using Sandisk class 2 2GB microSD card which should be fine for this purpose. </p><p>I also noticed this in my dmesg log which could have hampered my effort:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   34.760000] mmc_spi: Unknown symbol mmc_spi_get_pdata (err 0)
[   34.770000] mmc_spi: Unknown symbol mmc_spi_put_pdata (err 0)</code></pre></div><p>My soldering should be fine and I have ensured that my GPIO pins that are relevant to my SD card data transfer are not used by something else.</p><p>I&#039;m running revision r36713.</p><p>Any idea on the problem?</p><p>Thank you :-)</p>									</div>
