					<p>I just bought my first WRT54G (V3), and wanted to build a mesh network (Using the Broadband-ham firmware, <a href="http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/">http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/</a> , which as I understand is based on OpenWrt). I wasn&#039;t paying careful enough attention, and downloaded the firmware for the WRT54G v1, and burned it. I&#039;m unable to get to any online documentation, and have been working my way though troubleshooting this. Here&#039;s what I can figure out.</p><p>1. I can get the router into safe mode. I can&#039;t figure anything from there that&#039;s useful I can do, but I&#039;ve done it.<br />2. The router accepts pings on 192.168.1.1, giving a TTL code 100 if I start from the beginning, and 64 if in safe mode.<br />3. I have this hooked up to a Windows 7 machine. I&#039;ve tried using the TFTP software, but while it occasionally looks like it&#039;s trying to erase the firmware. It stays there for a few seconds, then it looks like it times out, and tries again.<br />4. I&#039;ve tried rebooting this while running a large loop on tftp.<br />5. I&#039;ve tried TFTP also when running in safe mode.</p><p>Any ideas about what else to try? I feel like I&#039;ve almost got it figured out, but that last 10% is killing me... Thanks!</p>									</div>
