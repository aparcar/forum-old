					<p>According to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Firmware/CFE">CFE-Customizing Documentation</a> the part of the CFE-Settings don&#039;t change the address the TFTP-Client ist listening to at boottime. But the address the TFTP-Server is listening to <em>must</em> be in the CFE-Image, so i took a look in it - and found another hard-coded IP-Address pointing to 192.168.1.1. But how could we change it? And is that the address we have to change for that purpose?</p><p>I figured out that a &quot;diff cfe-test1.bin cfe-test2.bin&quot; says that the files are identical, where &quot;cfe-test.bin&quot; is generated with &quot;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 of=cfe-test1.bin&quot;, and &quot;cfe-test2.bin&quot; is the output of &quot;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 &gt; cfe-test2.bin&quot;. That gives the ability to put a sed in the pipe like &quot;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 | sed -e &quot;s/192.168.1.1/192.168.0.1/g&quot; &gt; cfe.bin&quot;. If you want other settings as well just expand the sed, so a version that implements the changes mentioned in the CFE-Customizing doc look like &quot;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 | sed -e &quot;s/192.168.1.1/192.168.0.1/g&quot; -e &quot;s/boardflags=0x0118/boardflags=0x0318/&quot; -e &quot;s/boot_wait=off/boot_wait=on/&quot; &gt; cfe.bin&quot;. Of course, you can use other IP-addresses than mine and other optimizations, they are just exsamples.</p><p>I think, there are checksums in the file, theese are now incorrect of course. To handle this issue i extracted the cfe.txt from the cfe.bin by typing &quot;dd if=cfe.bin&nbsp; bs=1 skip=4116 count=2048 | strings &gt; cfe.txt&quot;, i didn&#039;t find a more elegant way for that, i haven&#039;t searched for one either. Then without touching the cfe.txt (well, i just did a &quot;cat cfe.txt&quot; to ensure me the changes were actually made...) i ran &quot;nvserial -i cfe.bin -o cfe_new.bin -b 4096 -c 2048 cfe.txt&quot; as advised in the doc. The output of a diff on theese files confirm me that there must be some kind of checksums, cause the files differ from each other.</p><p>Now i put the newly created cfe to my WRT54GSv2 with the JTAG method, crossed my fingers - the unit booted without any problems, an extract of the CFE-content on the router showed me the changed values. The next test was to try to get something via tftp from the router, so i started the tftp as mentioned in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP?action=show&amp;redirect=OpenWrtViaTftp">Installing via TFTP</a> doc, at the first time with the 192.168.1.1-address. Cause I don&#039;t want to install anything I just tried to get something from the router, so instead of &quot;put ...&quot; I used &quot;get openwrt-wrt54gs-2.4-squashfs.bin&quot;. The comand timed out while the router booted completely up, as i expected. Now i tried the same at port 192.168.0.1, and got at an early boot state of the router the unexpected message &quot;received ERROR &lt;code=3, msg=transfer cancelled&gt;&quot; I hope, that is &#039;cause the file i want to recieve isn&#039;t on the router at least at that name or the router won&#039;t let me get the file. I&#039;ll do additionally testing on it incl. putting files on it, but that may last, so just handle the things above as an idea how it <strong>might</strong> work.</p><p>For now - happy hacking... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>peter</p>									</div>
