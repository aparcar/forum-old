					<p>Is anyone else having issues with WDS clients on the 3200ACM? I can&#039;t get my 1900AC or 1900AC v2 to connect to my 3200ACM and pass data. They connect but RX remains at 48Mbis and TX at 1300Mbits on the 1900&#039;s. The 3200ACM shows 6Mbits on each from each router. I am running davids current builds for each on all of my routers. I have installed bridge and nothing seems to be working. All my other devices remain stable and connected. Is there something I can do to fix this, or is this driver related (dealing with WDS)?</p>									</div>

					<p>What is wrong with intel 7260 and mwlwifi? The connection works fine then slows to a crawl, google becomes unresponsive because of such a slow connection. a manual disconnect and reconnect is required to fix the speed for a short time until it happens again. I have not seen this before as i had moved to a wired only set up but now that im back in wireless I&#039;ve notice this problem...</p><p>WRT 3200ACM<br />K4.9.37<br />Latest mwlwifi<br />nothing but the basics built<br />tftp flashed on both partitions then reset the config partition<br />latest intel wireless drivers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lifehacksback</strong> on 25 Jul 2017, 15:55)</p>
