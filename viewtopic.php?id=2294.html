					<p>I have the wrt54g and after commiting something to the nvram, my router stoped rresponding. If i ping it the request times out, but when i have 2 computers connected via ethernet (with static ips set) they can ping each other, i have a V.2 router, i have tryed the pin shorting debrick method and it didnt work, but once i earth the router to its self, i got a few pings out of it and i got a chance to ttftp a new firmware to it, but now it wont any more, but it will still ping the 2 pcs but not the router (yes im pinging it default ip i never changed to anything else), does any one think a jtag cable will work on it? and if so where can i buy one cheaply or is bvilding one too hard, (my soldering skills are limtied.) thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>JTAG worked for me after I turned my router into 100% brick and nothing else worked, no ping, no tftp, short pint, etc.&nbsp; JTAG cable allows to write directly to the flash memory.&nbsp; Since you are getting pings give tftp another try and wait a few minutes after upload has finished before resetting.&nbsp; Then try to boot into failsafe mode (hold reset button for 2 sec once you see dmz light come on).&nbsp; Otherwise solder jtag cable, all you need is a db25 connector a few wires and a few resistors - should be easy.</p>									</div>
