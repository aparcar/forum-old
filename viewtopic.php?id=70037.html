					<p>Hey forum,</p><p>I consider buying a TP-Link Archer C1200 AC1200 but I&#039;m not sure if it supports OpenWrt. I can see quite a few Archers in the list, but not this particular one, so can somebody please advise?<br />I&#039;d be really happy if someone could confirm that it&#039;s supported, because it&#039;s the only router with fast 5G and fast Ethernet in my price range.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />- Jaapyse</p>									</div>

I wanted to put in a link to a website with some information, but the forum wouldn&#039;t let me (and still won&#039;t). Try searching for &quot;TP-Link Archer C1200 (2016)&quot; on routerchart.com, it&#039;ll show up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey zo0ok,</p><p>Thank you for your reply. The router you linked to is the one I&#039;m looking at. It&#039;s a pity. Could you (or someone else) maybe advise me on a router that has 1Gbit/s Ethernet and &gt;450Mbit/s 5Ghz WiFi on a budget? (OpenWRT capable of course.) I could turn down my demands, but if possible I would like to find something that fulfills these criteria.</p><p>Thanks for the help so far.</p><p>- Jaapyse</p>									</div>
