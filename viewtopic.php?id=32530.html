					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I just installed OpenWRT 10.3-rc5 on my D-Link DIR-825 and everything works great so far. I configured wifi settings, ppoe to connect to the internet, mac filtering etc. However I&#039;m having some trouble with my IPv6 configuration. My provider offers dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 and I don&#039;t seem to be able to configure the LAN side properly.</p><p>I can check from the web interface that the WAN side gets an /64 IPv6 address from my provider over ppoe (it has a global and a link-local ipv6 address). I also enabled radvd for the LAN side. However, my LAN side only has a link-local IPv6 address and the computers on the LAN don&#039;t get an IPv6 address. I have not configured a manual IPv6 address on the LAN side since my provider gives me a different one every time the ppoe connection is established, much like the IPv4 address.</p><p>With the stock D-link firmware (v. 2.05EU) I was able to use DHCP-PD to relay the IPv6 address of the WAN side to the LAN side. Can anyone provide some information on how to do the same (or something similar) with OpenWRT? I&#039;ve installed the wide-dhcpv6 server and client packages and messed with that configuration to no avail.</p><p>Any help will be much appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hm, wide-dhcpv6-client is supposed to take care of that. In /etc/config/dhcp6c, set the &quot;enabled&quot; option to &quot;1&quot;, run &quot;/etc/init.d/dhcp6c enable&quot; and &quot;/etc/init.d/dhcp6c restart&quot;. Eventually a global IPv6 prefix should appear on br-lan. If not, check &quot;logread&quot; and look for related messages. If a prefix was successfully acquired, the dhcp6c client takes care of restarting radvd to make it aware of the new lan prefix. You just have to configure (=enable) radvd in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply, jow. I followed your suggestion but I still can&#039;t get a global v6 address on br-lan.</p><p>I&#039;m a bit confused regarding the dhcpv6 client configuration. I gather that the client should talk to a dhcpv6 server to get the information, right? Which server would that be? A wide-dhcpv6-server I should run on the wan? Or the dhcpv6 server that (I guess) my ISP runs?</p><p>In the former case, I don&#039;t know how to configure the wide-dhcpv6 server on the wan because all examples I found need a static address range. Since my ISP gives me a different v6 address every time pppoe is established, I don&#039;t have a static range. Can I configure it so that it gets the range from the prefix of the wan interface? If so, how?</p><p>In the latter case, I&#039;m not sure but I don&#039;t think that my ISP runs a dhcpv6 server since I was able to get the v6 address on wan even before I installed the wide-dhcpv6 server and client packages. Is dhcpv6 involved when I get the v6 address on pppoe? I didn&#039;t think so. If so, do I need any special configuration for the dhcp client?</p><p>I&#039;ve disabled the wide-dhcpv6 server and left only with the client. I have a global v6 address on the wan interface but only a link-local on the br-lan. Just for reference, here&#039;s my dhcpv6 client configuration:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;dhcp6c&#039; &#039;basic&#039;

					<p>After looking into the actual wide-dhcp6c configuration in /var/etc/dhcp6c.conf I was finally able to fix my issue.</p><p>I had to change the /etc/config/dhcp6c configuration the interface to: option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039; in the config &#039;dhcp6c&#039; &#039;basic&#039; section. However, after I did that, my ISP was immediately terminating the connection as soon as it was established. So I also had to add the following section:</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;enabled&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>Now my configuration in /etc/config/dhcp6c is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;dhcp6c&#039; &#039;basic&#039;
