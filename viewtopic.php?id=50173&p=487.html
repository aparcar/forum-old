I had been working on the assumption that David had the same issue that Dheeran Senthilvel wrote about on the LEDE mailing list, which someone has already linked to here. In that case at least the last problem he had was due to u_env being invalid and the bootloader not saving the defaults when reset.</p><p>The thing is that fw_setenv in Linux will save a set of defaults when it finds an invalid/empty partition. It then checks out as correct since it has a valid checksum, but it&#039;s lacking the values the Marvell u-boot is looking for. The auto_recovery stuff mucks this up a little more when it falls back and writes out a new value for &#039;boot_part&#039;. In that case, sysupgrade will write the new image (unlike in David&#039;s case) but it won&#039;t come back correctly after the reboot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>leitec</strong> on 14 Jun 2016, 18:21)</p>

Are you having any major issues with the router? Did you get the u-boot settings put back?</p>									</div>
