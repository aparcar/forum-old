					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>I&#039;m trying to install a 3rd party signed cert I have for my home domain into Luci so that I may have HTTPS access.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked through numerous posts and even though think I&#039;m close, cannot get it to work.&nbsp; Below are the router&#039;s details plus different things I&#039;ve tried so far:</p><p><strong>Environment Details</strong><br />- Router: Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H<br />- OpenWRT: Barrier Breaker 14.07<br />- LuCI Trunk: (0.12+svn-r10530)</p><p><strong>What I&#039;ve Tried So Far</strong><br /><em>In no particular order...</em><br />- SSL related packages currently installed: luci-ssl, ca-certificates, libopenssl, libpolarssl, libustream-polarssl, openssl-util<br />- Created the path &quot;/etc/ssl/certs&quot;<br />- Downloaded my .crt file plus matching .key into path above using wget<br />- Edited &quot;/etc/config/uhttpd&quot; and tried a few things<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Edited &quot;cert&quot; and &quot;key&quot; options to go to .crt &amp; .key files in /etc/ssl/certs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tried commenting out entire &quot;config cert px5g&quot; section<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Tried commenting out both &quot;list listen&quot; lines for 443 (as I read cert would be generated if they were used and I alsoready have a cert<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- After each edit, restarted service using the string &quot;/etc/init.d/uhttpd restart&quot;</p><p>After some changes I&#039;d still get prompted for the cert not being secure / invalid but after most changes I simply wasn&#039;t abvle to browse to &quot;https://192.168.0.1.&quot;&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing something obviousl or small.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I am using CHAOS CALMER (15.05, r46767) and https is working for me.</p><p>I installed luci-ssl, created symbolic links /etc/uhttpd.crt and /etc/uhttpd.key pointing to my cert and key, and restarted uhttpd. The .crt-file contains the complete cert chain (cert + intermediate CA + self signed root CA) in PEM format. (I made symbolic links since I already had my cert in another location used by strongswan.)</p><p>Uhttpd seems to be working fine. (Chromium complains about the cipher suit being obsolete, which might be caused by my cert which has a sha1 signature. My cert also doesn&#039;t match the local IP address of the firewall I am connecting to.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikma</strong> on 21 Nov 2015, 12:22)</p>
