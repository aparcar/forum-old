					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;m a licensed Radio Amateur and legaly allowed to run much more RF power than any router<br />can produce cause WLAN is inside the 13cm amateur band. </p><p>Anyway I&#039;m running a MR-3040 with OpenWRT firmware and found out that<br />the max. RF-power it produces is limited to 18dBm regardless which country is selected<br />(I selected 00 - World). So it seems to be that output power is limited by software.</p><p>I would like to remove that limitation to run the TRX Chip at its max. rf power.</p><p>How do I have to modify OpenWrt or how can I remove that limit in another way?<br />I&#039;, not very experienced in programming...</p><p>Thank you very much for your help</p><p>regards<br />Peter</p>									</div>
