					<p>Hello folks,</p><p>I&#039;ve compiled the OpenWrt source for WRT160NL based on the instruction here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl?s">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl?s</a><br />and upgraded the firmware using the sysupgrade command. But now the router wouldn&#039;t boot completely and I can only connect to it through the serial interface. Bellow you can see the output of bootwrt command:</p><p>---cut---<br />ar7100&gt; bootwrt<br />## Booting WRT160NL ...<br />## Booting image at 80060000 ...<br />Bad Magic Number<br />---cut---</p><p>It sounds like there is something wrong with the flash partition as even the &#039;ls&#039; command fails with the following error message:</p><p>---cut---<br />ar7100&gt; ls<br />mtdparts variable not set, see &#039;help mtdparts&#039;<br />ar7100&gt; mtdparts default<br />ar7100-nor0: partitioning exceeds flash size<br />---cut---</p><p>I&#039;m wondering:<br />1) How can I boot the router to the new image given the current situation?<br />2) How can I reset the router to the default firmware? I know about the reset button but pushing it for 5 sec after the boot doesn&#039;t do anything. Somewhere I read we should push both buttons on the board simultaneously, that didn&#039;t work either for me. Is there a really clear procedure to bring the router into the fail safe mode?</p><p>I&#039;m a newbie in this space and although I saw some other threads for WRT160NL, none seem to be solving my issue. So, I appreciate any ideas/solutions for this case.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hhamid</strong> on 6 Aug 2010, 02:26)</p>
