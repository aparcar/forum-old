					<p>Hello,</p><p>I got gphoto2 to compile and run using openwrt. But doesnt run properly because it needs libusb to be specified as a compile option, but there is no place in menuconfig to specify that. </p><p>Menuconfig only allows me to select gphoto2 to be included in the build, but not any sub-options related to gphoto2.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Same goes for libgphoto2 (which is the library used by gphoto2) I need to select weather I want to compile for a serial or usb interface, and other stuff, but menuconfig has no where to select compile options for individual packages.</p><p>Also, how will gphoto2 or libgphoto2 know where the libusb library is located after libusb is compiled? Is there a way to specify the path to it in menuconfig or someplace else? because I get an error saying it cant find libusb, but its there!</p><p>Does anybody know how to do that?</p><p>Do I have to run ./configure &lt;options&gt; and specify the options and paths for the individual packages before I do the global make to make openwrt?</p><p>Thanks<br />rough_neck</p>									</div>
