But i am confusing on the sixth one. It is just not clear enough for me.</p><p>&#039;&#039;6.To get rid of &quot;date illegal option&quot; you can add to your .bash_profile:<br />PATH=&quot;/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;&#039;</p><p>I am not sure if i should I type that into bash. I tried to do so but bash responded that &#039;No such file or directory&#039;.</p><p>I tried to skip the sixth step, the seventh is fine, (don&#039;t know why there&#039;s no step 8),but after typing &#039;/Volumes/OpenWrt&#039; as the step 9 say, bash responded &#039;No such file or directory&#039; again.</p><p>Need help from you guys!</p><p>Thank you all</p>									</div>
