					<p>I have run Kamikaze on WRT54GL 1.1 and I did not notice any problems.&nbsp; I did not use Kamikaze for long on that router, though.&nbsp; I just tried it out.&nbsp; You should probably stick to the 2.4 version of the kernel, though, since I think the 2.6 wireless drivers for the WRT54GL are still a little experimental.&nbsp; (i.e. the Kamikaze image that comes with kernel version 2.4.)</p><p>By the way, Kamikaze does not use nvram.&nbsp; It stores the settings in files in /etc/config.&nbsp; You can use the &quot;uci&quot; command (similar to the nvram command) or edit the files directly.</p><p>Kamikaze does not come with a Web interface, although the X-Wrt people are working on that.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried X-Wrt, but according to their web page it looks like it should mostly work on Kamikaze.</p><p>A tip for searching the Wiki:&nbsp; If you don&#039;t find something by clicking on the &quot;title&quot; button, try the &quot;text&quot; button.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wodin</strong> on 1 Feb 2008, 00:24)</p>

					<p>Sammy, unless you want 2.6 kernel with no wireless I&#039;d suggest staying with Whiterussian.</p><p>While I got the 2.4 kernel of Kamikaze running I&#039;ve never put it into &quot;production&quot; use because it lacks many simple configurations (simple AP mode has no cionfig for txpower, no ability to run both tkip and aes... to name a few).</p><p>I made my own unofficial bug fix for Whiterussian router client mode if anyone needs it.</p><p>Broadcom wireless (the b43 project) is getting close but not there yet.&nbsp; That should change things (the 2.6 kernel on free firmware/drivers).</p><p>Basically, Kamikaze 7.09 2.4 kernel gives NO benefit over Whiterussian 0.9 on a WRT54GL I can think of at this time.</p><p>HTH<br />Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your replys. </p><p>The main reason I want to switch to Kamikase 7.09 is that I never got any form of WLAN working with Whiterussion no matter what I have tried (without MAC filter, without encryption, it really drove me insane) </p><p>What I basicly wanna use is WLAN (without encryption) in conjunction with OpenVPN and shorewall... thats all... if that works I am the happiest person on earth <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>And last but not least I dont like that nvram hacking stuff (Yeah I know a mips is not a pc....)</p>									</div>
