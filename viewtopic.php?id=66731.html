					<p>Hello, <br />I spent the last hour describing my problem and when I tried to preview it, it was gone! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> ... Anyway, I will do it again here, and shorter and to the point. </p><p>I have a router marketed as MPR-M1 which is physically the same as the Hame MPR-A1, the chipset is the Ralink RT5350F. Looking at the model and information in the web interface of the router I saw that is the same as the A5-V11&nbsp; (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unbranded/a5-v11">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/unbranded/a5-v11</a>:<br />software version: 2.1.3.8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;product model: Mifi-Storage-3G<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;serial number: ZJL2014XXXXX<br />&nbsp; hardware version: 1.0<br />&nbsp; f/w release date: Aug. 23, 2013 15:27:22</p><p> So, I followed the directions there I succesfully installed the OpenWRT 15.05 and also the Sysupgrade. </p><p>First problem: I was trying to compile ddserver (dslrdashboardserver), and I got the message: &quot;cannot install ddserver missing dependencies libusb and uclibc&quot;, any idea? but well, this is not the worst.</p><p>Second problem: I was trying to get to the original firmware, becasue of the WIFI access to storage, (I haven&#039;t explore that in OpenWRT, but apparently is also possible), and for curiosity. The only thing I could find was this: <a href="http://www.edtv8.com/English/Support/Update/">http://www.edtv8.com/English/Support/Update/</a>. I don&#039;t remember how I got there, but it made sense in that moment. I think I found it from another forum. Anyway, I download the version corresponding to the one I had in the original (2.1.3.8) and followed this: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.uninstall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.uninstall</a>.</p><p>This is what I got: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@192.168.1.1&#039;s password:

[Process completed] </code></pre></div><p>----------------------------------------------------</p><br /><p>After the process was completed the router didn&#039;t reboot and it had only a red light without sending any data. While trying some options I&nbsp; noticed that turning it on while presing the reset button, it keeps a blue light. Although doesn&#039;t appear as connected trough ethernet or wifi, it sends data or packets, I saw this with wireshark, as recomended for sniff packets and entering to failsafe mode. I couldn&#039;t do it though. </p><p>So, did I brick my router? what else can I do? (not soldering, opening, etc, I don&#039;t think I can manage that)</p><p>I am not an expert so, please be patient and do not give too much technical tails, I will really appreciate any help though...</p><p>I am on Mac OS 10.11.6 if that is of any help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>narvaezmena</strong> on 11 Aug 2016, 09:47)</p>
