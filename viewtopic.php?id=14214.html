					<p>Hello,</p><p>I need some help. I did a &quot;chmod 644&quot; on the file /etc/init.d/network. I Kamikaze 7.06 2.6 kernel. Since wireless does not work with kernel 2.6, I thought I could disable this script. In the script there was only wireless related code. That is why I did what I did. I guess I was wrong. Since I was lock out of another different (wrt54gs) router before and was able to fix it by shorting pins 5-6 and tftping image, I thought I could fix this one. However, this one is hard than the first. This is what I did.</p><p>Tried pins 5-6. with no ping reply<br />Tried pins 1-2 I got ping reply. However the image would not tftp over. These are my tftp commands</p><p>#tftp 192.168.1.1<br />&gt;binary<br />&gt;rexmt 1<br />&gt;timeout 60<br />&gt;trace<br />&gt; put image_file.bin</p><p>So what I did next, while ping was still occurring, was to telnet in. I thought if I am pinging it I should be able to connect. I tried to ssh in, but did not work. Telnet into 192.168.1.1 worked. However,all of my configurations were gone. It looked like everything was restored to original. I edited /etc/config/network file. I changed the ip of the lan config to static 192.168.0.4 and wan to static 192.168.0.7, which are valid IPs on my network. However, upon reboot nothing worked. I tried to short pins 1-2 again, but I can not get it to ping, I tried all the pins on that same side and no ping. I guess I could try the other side, but it began to ping before on pins 1-2. Can anyone please help?</p>									</div>

					<p>Shorting pins is <strong>never</strong> a good solution, there is always a better way to recover.&nbsp; One of the primary issues with shorting pins is exactly what has occured here: &quot;Oh pins x and y don&#039;t work, lets try shorting random pins to see if that makes it better.&quot; In reality it is quite possible you&#039;ve ruined the flash chip.</p><p>The reason that pin shorting <em>can</em> work has been discussed previously so I&#039;m not going to go into it.&nbsp; The standard order for attempting to connect to an &quot;unconnectable&quot; router -- I hate the term &quot;bricked,&quot; most of the time it can be recovered -- are as follows:<br />1) Failsafe.&nbsp; This allows you to get back into OpenWrt, mount the writable partition and correct your mistake.<br />2) TFTP&#039;ing a new image (since you should have boot_wait enabled.)<br />3) Serial Console.&nbsp; Open the case up and connect to the serial console, either to connect to OpenWrt once it has booted, or directly to the bootloader.&nbsp; Again, this can allow you to see what went wrong, and fix it.&nbsp; If you already have a pin header installed and have serial access I would use this before TFTP or Failsafe.<br />4) JTAG.&nbsp; A last resort, if the bootloader is messed up, JTAG can be used to flash a new bootloader, then a firmware image can be sent via TFTP.</p><p>All the above methods are mentioned on the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting page</a></p><p>In your case all bets are off.&nbsp; <span class="bbu">If</span> you have killed the flash chip there you will have to replace it to fix the router. When pin shorting (or other hardware failure) is not involved the above steps should always be able to recover the device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bartman007</strong> on 22 Jan 2008, 08:54)</p>

					<p>Bartman,</p><p>I have Kamikaze 7.06 and kernel 2.6 on the wrtsl54gs router. </p><p>Boot wait does not work on 2.6 kernel as you mention in a different post. Therefore tftping does not work upon boot. I guess I could continue to try tfting,&nbsp; Plus the DMZ led never lights up as needed, which is mentioned in wiki failsafe troubleshooting. I am not sure how the serial console works. I have a usb connection on my wrtsl54gs. I am not sure if this help because I see they talk about usb connection in the serial console troubleshooting wiki. I do not think JTAG will help since the problem is an edited script no the boot loader. So my qustion is do you think there is any chance of fixing the router or do you think it is dead?

					<p>nvram can&#039;t be accessed in the 2.6 kernel.&nbsp; This means that you cannot view, or modify the value of the boot_wait variable.&nbsp; boot_wait is a function of the bootloader, only available for a brief time after power on, before OpenWrt begins booting.&nbsp; If it was previously enabled, boot_wait will still work when Kamikaze brcm47xx-2.6 is installed, but it cannot be enabled/disabled.&nbsp; brcm-2.4 can manipulate nvram using the `nvram&#039; command.</p><p>The CFE&gt; prompt is part of CFE, the bootloader, the firmware installed has effect on this prompt.&nbsp; You will always be able to manipulate nvram from here.
