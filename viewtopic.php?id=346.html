					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;New OpenWRT user here.&nbsp; First off, just wanted to let you know that OpenWRT is happily running a local charity that helps abused children.&nbsp; I installed OpenWRT because I wanted to block port 25 into the SMTP server to only the external antispam/antivirus provider, and it works great.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s the wierd part, though - in my inital testing post-boot, I connected to the Ethernet side of the router just fine from my laptop and got a proper DHCP setup (I changed the subnet to, let&#039;s say, 192.168.45.x).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But, when I brought my wireless up, it connected fine, but I couldn&#039;t ping anything.&nbsp; After further investigation, I noticed that my wireless was getting an address of 192.168.1.20 from DHCP!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the deployed scenario it wasn&#039;t a big deal because the new network we set up has a Winblows DHCP server, but I&#039;d like to set up OpenWRT on my new WRT54GS at home, and I am using DHCP there, so it will matter.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Any hints on what could have cause this? Seems strange to me.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure where to look for that oddity you see, but you might want to check the config files. What config file to look in depends on what &quot;version&quot; of OpenWrt you are using.</p><p>If you&#039;re using dnsmasq as your DHCP server, which is the &quot;new&quot; method, you&#039;ll need to change the IP range (it hands out) in /etc/dnsmasq.conf:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># enable dhcp (start,end,netmask,leasetime)
dhcp-range=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.250,255.255.255.0,12h</code></pre></div><p>If you&#039;re using udhcpd as your DHCP server, which is the &quot;old&quot; method, you&#039;ll need to change the IP range in /etc/udhcpd.conf:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>start 192.168.1.20
end 192.168.1.250</code></pre></div><p>I suspect you are using the old method (udhcpd) since the default range in udhcpd.conf is from 192.168.1.20 - 192.168.1.250. If you are unsure, check <strong>ps</strong> for &#039;udhcpd&#039;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Shoot, knew I forgot something.</p><p>I loaded the last (0630) version of NicoWRT because I also want to make this router a PPTP server when I can.</p><p>It was running both udhcp and dnsmasq.&nbsp; There&#039;s no dnsmasq.conf, but it&#039;s started from inittab with the command line &quot;/usr/sbin/dnsmasq -d -l /tmp/udhcpd.leases -s lan&quot; and udhcpd.conf was indeed still configured for 192.168.1.20 through 250.</p><p>So thanks, that clears the 192.168.1 issue up, because that file isn&#039;t autoconfigured.&nbsp; But then where did the 192.168.45 address on the Ethernet side come from?</p><p>Was it dnsmasq automatically serving from the subnet via compiled-in code?</p><p>Appreciate the pointers - I should have investigated a bit more before posting, but the first router was kind of a rush job.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s probably too late now, but you could&#039;ve done a &quot;IPCONFIG /ALL&quot; from your Windows machine to see which DHCP server offered that IP address. </p><p>I doubt it was your OpenWrt, since udhcpd can only hand out one range of IP adresses, and dnsmasq requires a config file that describes the range (unless given from the commandline, which obvious isn&#039;t the case looking at the line from /etc/inittab).</p><p>Your version of OpenWrt only uses dnsmasq as a caching nameserver.</p>									</div>
