					<p>Hi all,</p><p>today I followed the openwrt wiki &quot;Configure a guest WLAN using the Luci web-Interface&quot; entry. (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gu â€¦ binterface</a>).</p><p>After I restarted the router, I see the following info on Luci&#039;s &quot;Overview&quot; page:</p><p>&quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot;</p><p>This message is shown below both of my &quot;Generic 802.11bg Wireless Controller (radio0)&quot; wifi Networks (the non-guest one still worked before adding the guest Network).</p><p>My wifi Network &quot;Generic 802.11an Wireless Controller (radio1)&quot; still works as expected.</p><p>There&#039;s noch state change when I disable the guest Network. As found here in the Forum, Setting a Band Channel from &quot;Auto&quot; to a Manual one should help, this is not possible. The &quot;Operating frequency&quot; Dropdowns are all empty.</p><p>Do you have any idea or Need any additional Information from my config files? It would be very Kind if you could help me, so my friends can use my wifi, too. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Thanks and Kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p>									</div>

Most likely your 2.4 GHz radio will refuse to work if it is requested to operate on the 5 GHz band. See <a href="http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/tree/hostapd/hostapd.conf">http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/tree/hostapd/hostapd.conf</a> and search for &#039;operation mode&#039; to find the explanation what this option does.</p><p>You should be able to verify if this is the root cause by observing the kernel ring-buffer (dmesg) after restarting your router. Most likely you will see an error related to setting up the wireless device. Change the option, and the problem should go away.</p><p>You should also look at the &#039;htmode&#039; option you supply to the second radio device. If this radio is the 5 GHz one, then you can get more throughput by using one of the &#039;VHT&#039; options listed in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless#mac80211_device_options">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wirele â€¦ ce_options</a> if your device supports them.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 10 Jul 2017, 09:50)</p>

I made a mistake and added my config files, after I tried to make my MY_WLAN work again. One step trying to make it work again was disabling &quot;everything&quot; I set up / activated for my guest wifi. Therefore I also disabled both rules for port 53 and 67-68.</p><p>When I added your mentioned &quot;hwmode&quot; fix, I also enabled again both rules. I just checked my firewall config. For both rules there was no line &quot;option enabled &#039;1&#039;&quot; anymore (also no &quot;option enabled &#039;1&#039;&quot; which I added manually), but Luci showed both being enabled. I now restarted my router via vpn and will let you know, if it works.</p><p>EDIT: I edited my initial config file post, so that people perhaps read here later won&#039;t be confused.</p><p>Thanks and kind regards,</p><p>Dirk</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dirk1312</strong> on 11 Jul 2017, 10:51)</p>

					<p>Hi again,</p><p>this didn&#039;t work, what a pitty. I found one additional thing in my dhcp config file: the ip ranges overlapped for guest and vpn.

I now see the problem / conflicts. For me I defined a &quot;lan&quot; that has a static ip 192.168.0.1 and if anyone connects to &quot;lan&quot;, the user gets an ip within the range of 192.168.0.10 and 192.168.0.50, depending which is the first one available.<br />The same for &quot;guest&quot;. The interface has the static 192.168.0.155 and the user connecting gets an ip in the range of 192.168.0.156 and 192.168.0.175. So there were - in my eyes - no conflicts.<br />That in the configuration in the &quot;background&quot; the whole 192.168.0.x network was already reserved for the &quot;lan&quot; network&quot;, I didn&#039;t know.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Antek wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>From the routing perspective, your router does not know which addresses belong to which networks because the address ranges of the networks are overlapping.

One is reserved for your router, and one is a broadcast address. A few from the remaining 253 addresses fall inside the DHCP address pool, and are managed by it.</p><p>The remaining addresses which are not reserved and fall outside the DHCP address pool are free for the taking; while you might&#039;ve assigned only, say 25 or 20 addresses into the DHCP pool, then this does not limit the number of clients that your network can actually support. Since the wireless interface that is associated with your Guest network has no encryption or authentication requirements, anyone who is within range can hop on-board. If the DHCP pool is exhausted, then using DHCP on the client will not work, but that does not prevent the client from assigning a static address and then using your network.</p><p>Limiting the maximum size of the address pool by using a more restrictive netmask will effectively limit the maximum number of clients supported by your network, and thus reduce potential network load. A client can still assign itself a static address, but if the maximum limit has already been reached (i.e. all non-reserved addresses are assigned to a DHCP pool, and all of them are leased out at the moment), then traffic collisions are imminent and the &quot;rogue&quot; client could not communicate with the network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 12 Jul 2017, 13:10)</p>
