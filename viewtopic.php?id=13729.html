					<p>Hi</p><p>I have managed to install Kamikaze on the RouerBoard 153; and my goal is to bridge two wireless interfaces in ad-hoc mode. The corresponding section in /etc/config/network:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface backbone
        option type     bridge
        option proto    static
        option ipaddr   192.168.0.1
        option netmask  255.255.255.0</code></pre></div><p>And in /etc/config/wireless:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  wifi1
        option type     atheros
        option channel  149
        option agmode   11a

config wifi-iface
        option device   wifi1
        option network  backbone
        option mode     adhoc
        option ssid     WLAB_RB01_02BB
        option encryption none

config wifi-device  wifi2
        option type     atheros
        option channel  149
        option agmode   11a

config wifi-iface
        option device   wifi2
        option network  backbone
        option mode     adhoc
        option ssid     WLAB_RB01_03BB
        option encryption none</code></pre></div><p>This way, the br-backbone appears, and it includes ath1 and ath2; the MAC address of the bridge is the same as what the ath1 interface has. Everything seems to work; hovewer at random times I get this message: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ath2: received packet with  own address as source address</code></pre></div><p>And when I start olsrd on br-backbone, it gets really bad, and typing becomes really slow, so it took me 2 minutes to kill the olsrd process:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>printk: 6553 messages suppressed.
ath1: received packet with  own address as source address
printk: 6437 messages suppressed.
ath2: received packet with  own address as source address</code></pre></div><p>What could be the problem?</p>									</div>
