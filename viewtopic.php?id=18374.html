					<p>Here&#039;s the hardware I have:<br />wrt54g-&gt;v5 i think<br />wap54g<br />wrt54gl</p><p>Here&#039;s the problem:<br />I have a 2 story house with the wrt54g in the window, I can see this from my neighbors house with my laptop from his kitchen and even get an ip, its quite far and not sure how good of a connection it is as i haven&#039;t tested it in a bit, but that&#039;s another issue</p><p>My neighbor just got rid of his cable service, and is only going to be around now and then. So I&#039;d like to let him use my network.</p><p>What&#039;s the best solution to accomplish this?</p><p>I think I can do wrt54g-&gt;wap54g with WEP encryption enabled with the WAP54G in repeater mode, however I&#039;ve heard that that that&#039;s not the best solution for bridging networks etc.</p><p>Also my friend needs network to VPN to work so I&quot;m not sure client bridge mode settings are a good idea as then I suspect there wouldbe a double nat going on, and I&#039;d have to test if our work vpn client is smart enough to be ok with that.</p>									</div>
