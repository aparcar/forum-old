					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>a friend and I bought several modified TP-Link router in China. The models are WR703N, MR11U and MR13U.<br />They have the pepe2k uboot.</p><p>The problem is, that they all have the same mac address....<br />At the moment I change the mac address in /etc/config/network and/or /etc/config/wireless.</p><p>But this it not a long time solution for me because I use a big shell script to do a lot of things. Most likely I have a wanted mac address but sometimes I have the &quot;original&quot; one. In that case it can happen that I have two router in the same network with the same mac address.</p><p>Does anybody know how to change the mac address directly in the flash memory?<br />I would prefer not to solder a serial interface on it.</p><p>I found the mac twice in /dev/mtd0 on my MR13U.<br />According to /proc/mtd it is u-boot. But from my understanding it should be in &quot;art&quot;.<br />But the size of mtd0 is also not matching with the u-boot size.</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /proc/mtd <br />dev:&nbsp; &nbsp; size&nbsp; &nbsp;erasesize&nbsp; name<br />mtd0: 00020000 00010000 &quot;u-boot&quot;<br />mtd1: 0010cb7c 00010000 &quot;kernel&quot;<br />mtd2: 006c3484 00010000 &quot;rootfs&quot;<br />mtd3: 004f0000 00010000 &quot;rootfs_data&quot;<br />mtd4: 00010000 00010000 &quot;art&quot;<br />mtd5: 007d0000 00010000 &quot;firmware&quot;</p><p>I saved all parts of the flash with &quot;cat /dev/mtd0 &gt; /tmp/mtd0&quot; (and so on with mtd1... mtd5).<br />Also the file size confuses me...<br />All mtd files together have a size of 21,8MB but the flash size is only 8MB.</p><p>I don&#039;t want to brick my router but I want to change the mac address to the original one I can find printed on the back side of the router.</p><p>Here is the file size checked with du (du ./mtd*):<br />128&nbsp; &nbsp; ./mtd0<br />1076&nbsp; &nbsp; ./mtd1<br />6928&nbsp; &nbsp; ./mtd2<br />5056&nbsp; &nbsp; ./mtd3<br />64&nbsp; &nbsp; ./mtd4<br />8000&nbsp; &nbsp; ./mtd5</p><p>Does anybody know how I can change the mac? I&#039;ve heard that if I want to change the art partition, I need to build a new checksum. Is it really a checksum or just the second entry for the mac address?</p><p>My friend already tried to change the mac address within uboot (there is an option to change the mac).<br />But this also didn&#039;t work correct.</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />Georg</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FuLgOrE</strong> on 5 Sep 2014, 11:48)</p>

For the flash layout, consult <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/flash.layout#partitioning.of.squashfs-images">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/fla … hfs-images</a>. Some partitions are nested, e.g. mtd5 (firmware) = mtd1 (kernel) + mtd2 (rootfs), and so their accumulated size is greater than the flash size.</p><p>You can write to the second 64KiB block of flash in several ways.</p><p>1. From u-boot console (requires serial console).<br />2. From OpenWRT (requires custom build with write access to mtd0, which is disabled in standard builds);<br />3. pepe2k&#039;s u-boot has a command &quot;setmac&quot;, which is supposed to change MAC in flash. Accessible through serial console or net console (consult <a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod#network-console">https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod#network-console</a>).</p>									</div>

					<div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Since I have the mac address on 01fe00, what should be the PIN number?</p></blockquote></div><p>Let&#039;s get some things straight. Data such as MAC and model cannot reside here or there or some other place, but have to be where the firmware expects them. For your devices it means: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>- MAC at 01fc00<br />- model at 01fd00<br />- PIN at 01fe00</p></blockquote></div><p>(PIN is only relevant for your devices if the original stock F/W uses it, which I&#039;m not sure about. Perhaps it is not used in wr703. In any case, it is irrelevant to OpenWRT.)<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>How is it possible to write on a defined position on mtd0</p></blockquote></div><p>You cannot write to a specific address in flash. Only in chunks of at least 64KiB. So the strategy should be to get a flash part to your PC, edit with a hex editor, and write back.</p><p>Examples.</p><p>1. From u-boot console (needs serial console; perhaps possible thru net console, though I never tried).<br />- Prepare the flash block you want to change. Let&#039;s say, you only want to change the second 64K block of the flash that contains MAC and model. Create an ampty (all FF&#039;s) file of 64KiB (65536 bytes), let&#039;s call it data.bin, edit it and write (insert) MAC at offs fc00, and model at offs fd00.<br />- Set your PC ethernet IP to 192.68.1.2 and connect to the router. Set up TFTP server on your PC at 192.68.1.2 and make it serve data.bin created above.<br />- Power up the router and enter u-boot console thru serial adapter (explained elsewhere).<br />- Enter the following commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1
setenv serverip 192.168.1.2
tftpboot 0x80800000 data.bin
erase 0x9F010000 +0x10000
cp.b 0x80800000 0x9F010000 0x10000
md 0x9F01FC00</code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The first two commands set IP addresses or the router and TFTP server (your PC); then you download data.bin to RAM at 0x80800000, then erase the second 64KiB block of flash, and write (cp.b) from RAM to flash. The last command &quot;md&quot; (optional) will dump to the screen some bytes from flash, starting with the MAC, so you can see whether it is what you intended.</p><p>2. From OpenWRT with unlocked write access to mtd0.<br />- Make copy of mtd0 on your PC, let&#039;s call it mtd0_new.bin.<br />- Edit it in hex editor to your liking (MAC at offs 1fc00 &amp; model at 1fd00).<br />- Copy it back to /tmp of the router with SCP.<br />- Open SSH console and issue the command<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd write /tmp/mtd0_new.bin &quot;u-boot&quot;</code></pre></div><p>or perhaps<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd write /tmp/mtd0_new.bin /dev/mtd0</code></pre></div><p>(should be equivalent).<br />- reboot</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you guys!!! I could finally change the mac and remove the bullshit out of the second half of mtd0.</p><p>I try to describe everything very well, even if this is a bit redundant. The next one with the same problem don&#039;t have to read the whole thread.&nbsp; :-)<br />Maybe I&#039;m the next one who needs to read the instruction, in a few years...</p><p>PC:<br />Prepare an tftp server and set the IP of it to 192.168.1.2</p><p>Router (in my case with pepe2k uboot):<br />Take a look to the following link to learn something about the flash layout.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/flash.layout#partitioning.of.squashfs-images">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/fla … hfs-images</a><br />Command:<br />cat /proc/mtd <br />to find out, where which part is on the flash.<br />You also find out the erasesize (10000 = 64KiB). 64KiB is the smallest bock which can be erased at once.<br />In my case I backupped mtd0 with the bootloader in that way:<br />cat /dev/mtd0 &gt; /tmp/mtd0</p><p>PC:<br />Copy that file to the PC and cut it with split.<br />The file is 128KiB big and I didn&#039;t want to play around with the first half of the partition, because the uboot is inside there. This is the command to split the file in two 64KiB files:<br />split -s 64k ./mtd0 ./mtd0split<br />mtd0splitaa is the first half, mtd0splitab the second half. In my case, the rubbish was in the second half.<br />I used ghex to edit the file in Ubuntu.<br />I made sure to put only FF everywhere except the 3 positions:<br />fc00<br />fd00<br />fe00<br />It is not 1fc00 anymore, because the first half (10000) is cutted away already.<br />Now I set up a tftp server. On Ubuntu I installed the package tftpd-hpa and modifed the config in /etc/default/tftpd-hpa in that way:<br />TFTP_USERNAME=&quot;tftp&quot;<br />TFTP_DIRECTORY=&quot;/tftpd&quot;<br />TFTP_ADDRESS=&quot;0.0.0.0:69&quot;<br />TFTP_OPTIONS=&quot;--secure&quot;<br />I created a folder /tftpd and gave it 777 and chown nobody.<br />After that I put the modified file inside<br />Restart the tftpd service<br />/etc/init.d/ftfpd-hpa restart</p><p>Router:<br />Connect to uboot. In my case with pepe2k uboot I could press the reset button while booting for 7 seconds (8 times LED blinking) and could connect to the router via:<br />nc -u -p 6666 192.168.1.1 6666<br />to see something, I had to type &quot;help&quot; and pressed &quot;ENTER&quot;. <br />Then I followed the instruction from pepe2k on github:<br /><a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod">https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod</a><br />Set IP adress of router and server in the following way:<br />setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.1<br />setenv serverip 192.168.1.2<br />Check if both addresses are correct with these commands:<br />printenv ipaddr<br />printenv serverip</p><p>some additional useful information from pepe2k:<br />&quot;You should also note the size of downloaded image. For supported TP-Link and D-Link routers it will be always 0x10000 (64 KiB), but for Carambola 2 image size is different: 0x40000 (256 KiB). In all cases, the start address of FLASH is 0x9F000000 and for RAM: 0x80000000 (as you may noticed, I did not use start address of RAM to store image and you should follow this approach).&quot;</p><p>Copy the modified file to flash:<br />tftpboot 0x80800000 mtd0splitab</p><p>Check, if your mac address is saved in the RAM:<br />md 0x8080fc00</p><p>Commands to copy (risky part):<br />erase 0x9F010000 +0x10000<br />cp.b 0x80800000 0x9F010000 0x10000<br />md 0x9F01FC00</p><p>Explaination:<br />erase:<br />Flash starts at 0x9F000000 and the first 10000 (64KiB) is the uboot so we start at 0x9F010000.<br />Length is 10000, exatly the size of my cutted file<br />cp.b:<br />cp.b: source destination length<br />md:<br />check, if the new mac is set correctly</p><p>After all that you can type<br />reset<br />and try if it works.</p><p>Again:<br />Thank you guys!</p>									</div>
