					<p>Hi,</p><p>recently I discovered by accident that OpenWRT drops ICMP packets with a wrong checksum in the ICMP header.<br />Other home routers don&#039;t drop these packets. iptables also doesn&#039;t filter these packets by default.</p><p>Here is what I did:<br />I have an OpenWRT router configured with standard settings, so it performs NAT (Network Address Translation).<br />When sending an outgoing ICMP port unreachable (type 3, code 3) packet from a host behind the NAT to the public Internet, I can see the translated ICMP packet on the WAN interface.<br />When sending the same ICMP port unreachable message, but with a bogus checksum in the ICMP header, the packet gets dropped by OpenWRT.<br />I tested other home routers as well as iptables on Debian-Linux, but none of them drops ICMP packets with a bogus ICMP checksum.</p><br /><p>Why does OpenWRT act different? Does OpenWRT filter these bogus packets on purpose? What filter / rule is responsible for dropping the packets?</p><p>I know that&#039;s a very specific topic, but maybe there are OpenWRT developers around that can help me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><br /><p>Regards</p>									</div>
