					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am a newbie. Just checked the hardware compatibility list and saw the SMC SMCWBR14S-N as one of the compatible/supported hardwares. Has anyone tried installaing openWRT in SMCWBR14S-N2 ? Is this router model compatible ? </p><p>Thanks,<br />Bikal <br />UK</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m also wondering if it is possible. As far as I know, the SMCWBR14S-N is a predecessor of the SMCWBR14S-N2,<br />which doesn&#039;t seem to be supported now. But I do not know the architecture of both SMCWBR14S-N and<br />SMCWBR14S-N2 and if it is the same. To flash the correct version of OpenWRT one should know the architecture.</p><p>Where did you found the SMCWBR14S-N architecture description? I hope we can find the info about SMCWBR14S-N2<br />on the same place. I didn&#039;t found it on SMC&#039;s page and I do not want to look under the cover before the warranty<br />expires.</p><p>Stybi<br />Bratislava<br />Slovakia</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stybi</strong> on 4 Jan 2009, 02:31)</p>
