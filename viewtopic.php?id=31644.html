					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Long story short, after building a serial cable and playing around with openwrt-ar7-squashfs.bin and mtd0 and mtd1, I stupidly</p><p>put mdt2.bin &quot;fs mtd2&quot;</p><p>while connected via ethernet when ADAM2 was running (via a serial console).</p><p>This is contrast with the </p><p>dd if=mtd2.bin of=/dev/mtdblock/2</p><p>operation to load the modded ADAM2 bootloader.</p><p>I imagine that because the recommended method was via the linux running on the box, and my operation was done while ADAM2 was still running, I&#039;ve bricked the router permanently? The power light no longer lights, and there is just a fixed orange &quot;i&quot; light. No flashing, and no output on the serial console while loading.</p><p>Can someone confirm my fears? There is no JTAG on this model so it&#039;s for the scrap heap?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Amadeus</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>amadeus_z</strong> on 31 Aug 2011, 01:25)</p>

					<p>Sounds about right. No obvious JTAG according to <a href="http://www.earth.li/~noodles/hardware-dg834g.html">Noodles</a><br />I feel your pain. Just bricked an HTC Incredible the other day.</p>									</div>
