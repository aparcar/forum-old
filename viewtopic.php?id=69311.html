					<p>Hi all, hoping to pick at your brains to point me in the right direction. I&#039;m wanting a way to block all external connections (including concurrent) for a brief period of time and then an easy way to switch back. I need internal ips to communicate during the period, I have an old laptop with zone alarm that currently has a button to pause all external traffic, I basically want something similar but on the router that can be turned on/off through the CLI..</p><p>I&#039;m going to look at ways of doing so but basically hoping for any suggestions that might help me?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>Might be mistaken here, but I thought just stopping firewall service would accomplish what you want. And if it would, you can tie it to the hardware button if your router has it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Stopping the firewall service is not the same as blocking all external connections.</p><p>If you want to stop all forwarding of packets (from internal to external and external to internal) you can use iptables:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I FORWARD -j DROP</code></pre></div><p>Or you could just turn forwarding off (do the same for Ipv6)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code></pre></div>									</div>
