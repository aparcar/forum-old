If you live in a non-congested area, then your device will not detect any nearby AP, and will happily use 40MHz.

Upgrading the existing LEDE installation would be much safer. If needed then after upgrading you could always reset the configuration to defaults if keeping your current settings causes problems. That would be the same as starting from scratch except hopefully won&#039;t be needed.</p><p>1) Download the correct &#039;caimen&#039; upgrade file for the WRT1200AC to the computer connected with the ethernet. <br />2) Go to the browser page and click the &#039;browse&#039; to locate the &#039;caimen&#039; file. <br />3) Click when ready to upgrade. </p><p>Or just follow the instructons as shown in the screen image link above.</p>									</div>

ACM was never sold in Aus as far as I know so the mwlwifi firmware region would always be a problem. </p><p>I think you are right, WRT32X is exactly the same hardware. It lacks the &#039;open source ready&#039; branding on the box so I think that&#039;s why kaloz never added support as he did for the rest of the WRT series (he works for them afaik). It&#039;d be a licencing issue with the Killer stuff I think. I don&#039;t think there is anything stopping other people from adding support apart from lack of interest. There&#039;s a thread about it on the LEDE forum.</p><p>I&#039;m waiting/hoping there will be a new model based on the cortex a53/a72 marvell stuff soon, like the EspressoBin/MacchiatoBin. Fingers crossed it sees a wider release than the ACM if/when it happens.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>listerwrt</strong> on 20 Mar 2018, 12:38)</p>
