					<p>thanks for the reply but the change you recommended did not work , the script still runs action when the ping fails.</p><p>I wanted to try to use it for another purpose , run a command if ping response was positive to a specific IP .</p><p>Maybe I can reset my modem when the IPv4 is not detected correctly (sometimes fails to detect and has a standard IP in logs) .</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>murilo.xd</strong> on 5 Jul 2016, 22:53)</p>
