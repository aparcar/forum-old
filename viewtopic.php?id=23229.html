					<p>Would anyone have advice on how to debug hostapd and or ath9k. I haven&#039;t been able to identify the problem, but basically what happens is I&#039;m unable to associate with what appears to be a normal function access point running the RN2 card inside the routerboard/routerstation. I really don&#039;t know where to begin, but windows and mac laptops appear to do the same. It doesn&#039;t appear to actually connect, like just a general failure to associate. Any help would be greatful, and more info is probably needed, just not sure where to begin. I do have multiple routers in close proximity to each other and connections are non LOS at times, short distance though. Everything will work fine upon a reboot, but after time I find that I cannot associate with some of the access points.</p>									</div>
