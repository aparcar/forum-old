					<p>Shorewall is a very convenient gateway/firewall configuration tool developped and heavily maintained by Tom Eastep</p><p>I have been using shorewall-shell for years on my whiterussian openwrt system.<br />Shorewall-shell is not supported anymore, shorewall is now a perl program that cannot fit in the memory of my wrt54gl.<br />Tom developped Shorewall-lite wich allow compilation of the firewall rules on an administrative system and run them an target host system, openwrt kamikaze in this howto</p><p>I installed both shorewall-lite and shorewall6-lite on a linksys WRT54GL router running kamikaze 8.09.02<br />I installed a 2.6 kernel because I need full support for ipv6 firewalling (image files are the bcrm47xx ones).<br />Beware that the kamikaze 2.6 versions does not have full support for wireless networking on broadcom platforms (wrt54g for instance)</p><p>I decided to go with the last release of shorewall and I needed shorewall6, so I had to tweak it in order to run with openwrt. <br />I you dont want to go through all this stuff, then you will want to use the Fabio Longarai openwrt packages of shorewall (still in 4.0 and no shorewall6 port available)</p><p>For a good understanding of how shorewall-lite works, you should read <a href="http://www.shorewall.net/CompiledPrograms.html">http://www.shorewall.net/CompiledPrograms.html</a><br />I used the 4.4.8 version of shorewall.</p><p>1- Installing the shorewall administrative system:</p><p>Shorewall runs on linux and my PC runs windows, so I installed shorewall in a vmware debian virual machine.<br />You must have a working ssh from the administrative system to the openwrt system.<br />Get shorewall-4.4.8.tgz from any shorewall download mirror.<br />install (see <a href="http://www.shorewall.net/Install.htm)">http://www.shorewall.net/Install.htm)</a></p><p>Create the rules configuration directory for your firewall system.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mkdir /etc/shorewall/wrt</code></pre></div><p>I was previously running shorewall-shell on my openwrt system.<br />So I copied its configuration files into the /etc/shorewall/wrt folder as a starting set of rules.<br />For this part you are on your own, there are very good howtos on the shorewall.net website.</p><p>2- Now install shorewall-lite onto the openwrt system:</p><p>Shorewall requires the ip utility<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#opkg install ip</code></pre></div><p>Shorewall-lite requires the iptable-restore program<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#opkg install iptables-utils</code></pre></div><p>Shorewall install.sh requires the coreutils install utility.<br />This program is missing in the standard openwrt installation.<br />Download the coreutil package from openwrt repository.<br />Dont even try to install this huge package, it will not fit in the tiny memory of the wrt54.<br />Extract the install program, copy it to /usr/bin</p><p>Get shorewall-lite-4.4.8.tgz from a shorewall mirror into the /tmp folder of you openwrt device and install it<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cd /tmp
# wget http://www1.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/4.4/shorewall-4.4.8/shorewall-lite-4.4.8.tgz
# tar xzf shorewall-lite-4.4.8.tgz
# cd shorewall-lite-4.4.8
# root@wrt:/tmp/shorewall-lite-4.4.8# ./install.sh</code></pre></div><p>You can now remove the install utility from /usr/bin and the installation files from /tmp<br />openwrt does not support man, so you should remove the man files (disk space is very precious on embedded devices)<br />rm /usr/share/man/man5/shorewall-lite-vardir.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5/shorewall-lite.conf.5.gz /usr/share/man/man8/shorewall-lite.8.gz<br />If you do not have anything else in /usr/share/man, you can rm the directory.</p><p>On the openwrt system you should now run<br />/usr/share/shorewall-lite/shorecap &gt; capabilities<br />and then copy the capabilities file onto the export directory of the administrative system (/etc/shorewall/wrt)<br />EDIT: I thik this step can safely be skipped knowing shorewall will do it when building the rules set.</p><p>Shorewall installs the compiled programs in /var/lib<br />On openwrt le /var directory is RAM fs, so on reboot it will be lost.<br />I chose to setup my shorewall directory in mkdir /lib/shorewall-lite<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># mkdir /lib/shorewall-lite</code></pre></div><p>Create a new file /etc/shorewall-lite/vardir containing this unique parameter<br />VARDIR=/lib/shorewall-lite</p><p>Rewrite the startup script /etc/init.d/shorewall-lite<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
START=51

Its IP will work too.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># make install</code></pre></div><p>And your new firewall is now running on your openwrt system.</p><p>For shorewall6, you have to follow the same steps.</p><p>TIP:<br />I use the webif2 interface for setting my openwrt router (<a href="http://www.xwrt.org">http://www.xwrt.org</a>)<br />There is a cool utility I use for reading and analizing the firewall logs<br />http://your_router/cgi-bin/webif/log-browse.sh<br />If you want a better history of your log, you can save your log onto a file instead of the memery circular buffer<br />http://your_router/cgi-bin/webif/log-setup.sh</p>									</div>
