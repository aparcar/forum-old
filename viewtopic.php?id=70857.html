					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I am trying to write C code that uses stat and strftime to see the last modified time of a file.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> struct stat attrib;
    stat(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &amp;attrib);
    char time[50];
    strftime(time, 50, &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;, localtime(&amp;attrib.st_mtime));
    printf (&quot;%s\n&quot;, time);</code></pre></div><p>The code is pretty straight forward, and it works fine on Ubuntu, but for whatever reason, running this code in OpenWrt is causing the incorrect year and date to show up. Instead of 2017-05-07, I get 2024-05-01. Considering this code works fine in Ubuntu makes me think its OS related, but running &quot;ls -l&quot; shows the correct date too. Any ideas as to why this is happening?</p>									</div>
