					<p>OK, this was a wild ride.</p><p>I loaded Kamikaze on my WRT54GL router via previous firmwareâ€™s web interface. Telnet, set password, SSH. Then I modified some network settings, but I guess I entered something wrong over there. Upon restarting the network, router didnâ€™t come up, I couldnâ€™t even ping it. Oh well. And I couldnâ€™t just re-flash it via the web interface like before. Unplug, plug the computer directly into ADSL modem, weee forgot the default user/pass, found out after few hours, entered admin, setting up the poor modem into router mode with PPPoE to be able to connect to Internet and browse for help. After few hours of research I found about OpenWRT failsafe mode. Activated it, tried to fix /etc/config/network file but it wasnâ€™t there. OK, mounted JFFS2 with /sbin/mount_root, fixed network file there and reboot.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>Then, I followed <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11451">this forum post</a> to get me on track with basic essential config.</p><p>So, I am now left with default configuration with added PPPoE and wireless. But I also have a bunch of questions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>1. How do I install Kamikaze again (re-flash it), and how do I revert <strong>everything</strong> to defaults?</p><p>I cleared NVRAM to defaults with this commad: &quot;mtd -r erase nvram&quot;. So, given that Kamikaze is not using NVRAM anymore, this is the last time I should use this? (If only using OpenWRT, of-course). The NVRAM is now cleared and it will stay un-touched from now on, right?</p><p>And about installing the Kamikaze, I guess I should use this: &quot;mtd -r write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux&quot;? Is this correct? But how do I transfer the image and where? Will there be enough space? Or should I flash it with TFTP?</p><p>2. I want to use WPA2 with AES-only encryption (no TKIP and no TKIP-AES).</p><p>This is what I have enabled:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option encryption psk2
option key      blalblallala</code></pre></div><p>Is this correct? To what setting above config relates? I guess to WPA2, but I donâ€™t know which encryption it uses, TKIP, AES, TKIP/AES?</p><p>3. Wireless filter list. To allow only selected MAC addresses to connect wirelessly. Have no clue how to do this.</p><p>4. I would like to use static DHCP if itâ€™s possible. To always give specific IP address to the specific MAC address.</p><p>5. I would like to be able to use OpenDNS sometimes. In order to do that I need to set up their two DNS servers. How do I do that? While weâ€™re at it, I would also like dynamic IP support with OpenDNS, so when my IP changes, to report it to OpenDNS. That would be cool.</p><p>Other than my lack of knowledge about setting up Kamikaze, this thing rocks! I tried basically every other firmware there is (HyperWRT, HyperWRT Thibor, Tomato, DD-WRT, official firmware, Tarifa etc etc. Got fed up with everything, and compared the sizes of all of them and found out that the Kamikaze is the smallest, just 1.8 MB and thought this could be it!</p><p>So now I just need to learn how to set it up and this will be amazing. Thanks developers, with kamikaze, you did a stellar job.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been running 7.09 on a WRT54GL and Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 since if first came out and it looks like it&#039;s real stable.&nbsp; All the versions of Kamikaze seem to improve connectivity on the Broadcom wireless devices.&nbsp; The one thing I was concerned about though was the wireless transmit power level.&nbsp; Kamikaze seems to crank up the transmit power to a very high level by default.&nbsp; It probably won&#039;t hurt anything but since I don&#039;t need that much power, I run a script to set it lower.&nbsp; It might also help the router run a bit cooler.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common<br /># Install wl prior to using this script<br /># create /etc/init.d/txpwr<br /># chmod 755 /etc/init.d/txpwr<br /># run /etc/init.d/txpwr enable<br /># the stop function just displays the transmit power</p><p>START=90</p><p>boot() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/sbin/wl txpwr 40<br />}</p><p>start() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/sbin/wl txpwr 40<br />}</p><p>stop() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/usr/sbin/wl txpwr<br />}</p>									</div>
