					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>im looking for some wireless APs with following features:</p><p>-adjustable transmit power<br />-constant(manually adjustable) signal strength and bitrate<br />-multi ssid support (possibly vlans)<br />-voip support<br />-wireless distributing system support<br />-802.11 b/g <br />-PoE</p><p>Lower cost APs dont offer those features, so i intend to buy some other APs supported by OpenWRT. Now my question: does anyone have experience with certain APs, which i can 100% flash with OpenWRT, so that they offer me those features i mentioned above.<br />Thank you in advance.</p><p>I would appreciate a soon reply</p>									</div>

					<p>Lots of AP running WhiteRussian or Kamikaze will support most of those features.&nbsp; Not sure what VoIP support question is?</p><p>However few with builtin support for PoE, most you need an external splitter. Exception would be Ubiquiti PowerStation2.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you pls mention some APs (model+producer). The VoIP question is simply, that there must be a possibility/compliance to do VoIP with these APs.</p><p>Thnx in advance</p>									</div>
