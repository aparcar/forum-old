					<p>4huf,</p><p>Using the new gpio api, this is theoretically pretty easy:</p><p>in trunk/build_dir/linux-adm5120_router_le/linux-2.6.22.4/arch/mips/adm5120/platform.c add:</p><p>static struct i2c_gpio_platform_data i2c_gpio_data = {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .sda_pin&nbsp; &nbsp; = ADM5120_GPIO_P4L0,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // or use one of the other pins.... :-).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .scl_pin&nbsp; &nbsp; = ADM5120_GPIO_P4L1,<br />};</p><p>struct platform_device adm5120_i2c_gpio_device = {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = &quot;i2c-gpio&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .id&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 0,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .dev&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .platform_data&nbsp; &nbsp; = &amp;i2c_gpio_data,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; },<br />};</p><p>Then in trunk/build_dir/linux-adm5120_router_le/linux-2.6.22.4/arch/mips/adm5120/board.c<br />in adm5120_board_setup(void):</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; /* register i2c device */<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; platform_device_register(&amp;adm5120_i2c_gpio_device);</p><p>I added this just after the PCI registration.</p><p>In theory this should get working i2c for the edimax a lot nicer than writing your own i2c driver.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another option is to use<br />drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-parport-lite.c as a base, and substitute the relevant inb/outb commands for port reads and writes at the correct addresses.</p><p>Unfortunately I only have a TCN75 to test this, and so far the temperature seems to rapidly fluctuate between about 40 and 55 degrees when I read it using a microcontroller, so either i have blown two chips, or I don&#039;t understand the protocol.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how much use it will be to start experimenting with the above code given that I have no known working devices, so if you would like to try it out on some known good devices and let me know please go ahead.&nbsp; I can write up a detailed description of what to do on my website.</p><p>regards,<br />-biff.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought it would be something like that.&nbsp; Is it possible to put this code into OpenWRT, under a configuration<br />option?&nbsp; There are quite a few people using i2c with the Edimax.&nbsp; It would be nice if it wasn&#039;t necessary to <br />disable the gpio driver to use i2c, because gpio is also quite useful!</p>									</div>
