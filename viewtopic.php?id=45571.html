But I cant remember any 1043ND where failsafe mode did not work (only with bad firmware, but cant be as you were able to configure it before). I also did not see any 1043ND with a broken switch by now. If you can exclude a sometimes nasty &quot;network manager&quot; when it comes to debugging networks on modern distributions (which sometimes prevents you from properly setting up a fixed address and disables everything again when the cable is plugged / switch is resettet).<br />Try to make sure to set your Ethernet to a fixed 192.168.1.x and try to ping 192.168.1.1 entering failsafe mode. If this does not work im out of ideas...</p>									</div>

					<p>i cannot understand if you tried pressing many times the qss button during startup to trigger failsafe mode.. did you see the SYS led flashing REALLY fast? then you should be able to ping and hopefully telnet to 192.168.1.1, connecting via cable, not wifi....</p>									</div>

Depending on OS you use, you will take application you like<br />the best or the one you have ready. Nmap is fine tool for this task.<br />When you learn ip address, you have to connect to it via telnet or ssh<br />and do what other posters suggest.<br />From posts I cannot get if you tried ifconfig or else.<br />Sorry if I misunderstood your problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zoranfooboo</strong> on 10 Aug 2013, 07:08)</p>
