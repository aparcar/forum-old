					<p>A week ago I bought this BAD router. <br />For dismount it and attach to serial, I had to break the case because the screws are crappy, my toxr screwdriver broken it without problem, I dismount many routers in my life and only this is so crappy.<br />The story does not end here, I attached to the serial with GND, TX and RX, my USB-TTL converter is self powered so no VCC.<br />I unplug the power 2 times and after the second time the router does not start more, I hate this router. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I read in wiki no one know the jtag pinout, but I think my router is broken electrically so I can&#039;t recover it.<br />When I plug the power cord leds of ethernet switch power on for a moment, on serial I see many wrong char, I tried all speed between 1200 - 230400 but never seen something of good.<br />Is there some hope to bring it a new life?</p><p>Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>etness</strong> on 1 Mar 2014, 12:23)</p>

					<p>I discovered a short circuit about 7 Ohm between VCC and GND, I desoldered the Mips processor and short circuit disappear.<br />I updated the wiki, is better to remove serial before unplug the main power.<br />Maybe I will buy another one or the story with this router ended for ever.</p>									</div>
