					<p>I have built stunnel (version 4.05) for the OpenWRT environment and created an ipkg for it in my repository <a href="http://www.cobb.uk.net/openwrt/">http://www.cobb.uk.net/openwrt/</a>.&nbsp; It is dependent on libssl (available from ab0oo) and libpthread (available from ab0oo or Nico).&nbsp; As usual, I have left out all the documentation -- see the FAQ and examples on <a href="http://www.stunnel.org/">http://www.stunnel.org/</a>.</p><p>Use <em>stunnel -version</em> to see the compiled-in defaults and take a look at the example stunnel.conf in <em>/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf-sample</em> to see the configuration options I recommend.&nbsp; Note that I do not use chroot mode -- there is no good directory in the OpenWRT filesystems to chroot to where it can both write a .pid file and have access to certificates and other long term data.&nbsp; If you set uid and gid to -2, as I do, you will need to change the protection on the /tmp directory (use <em>chmod o+wt /tmp</em>).</p><p>It works for me (in client mode, for my particular requirement).&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tested other uses but let me know if it does not work for you.</p><p>Many thanks to Nico and ab0oo as well as to the stunnel folks for making it fairly straightforward to port.</p><p>Graham Cobb</p>									</div>

					<p>If you followed my suggestion and made /tmp world-writable, you will have found that SSH login using a public key has broken (because dropbear doesn&#039;t like root&#039;s home directory being world writeable).&nbsp; You need to remove the world write from the directory using: <em>chmod 700 /tmp</em>.</p><p>I have changed the sample configuration script to use <em>/var/run/</em> as the directory for the pid file (and <em>/var/log</em> for the log file if you use that).&nbsp; However, stunnel needs to be able to write these files while it is running as &quot;nobody&quot; so I have created a startup script (<em>/etc/init.d/S51stunnel</em>) which creates the directories and gives them the right protections.</p><p>There is an update to the package (revision wrt2) in my repository.</p><p>Graham</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry it isn&#039;t working for you.&nbsp; I use it all the time but it is only ever talking to other stunnel implementations (although these are standard debian versions, not versions I have built myself).&nbsp; I do not attempt to actually let it talk SSL to a non-stunnel program (either client or server).</p><p>If you want to build it yourself, here is the script I use to invoke configure to set the right options for the cross-compilation:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

					<p>I have had two separate people contact me this week about rebuilding stunnel, which turns not to be quite as simple as I remembered.&nbsp; So here, for posterity, is the information I think is needed.</p><p>Note: this is based on stunnel 4.05.&nbsp; I have no idea if this will work with other versions.&nbsp; Also, this information is how to build in the &quot;stable&quot; Openwrt environment.&nbsp; At least one of the people who cantacted me want to build in the &quot;experimental&quot; environment -- if you get it working please add a note here with any differences required.</p><p>The stunnel configure script is not designed to work in a cross-compiler environment.&nbsp; It is necessary to comment out the tests for /dev/ptmx and /dev/ptc in the configure script and the corresponding tests in configure.ac.&nbsp; In addition, it is necessary to run the configure script with lots of arguments (as in the previous reply) to tell it where to find things in the build environment.&nbsp; </p><p>The patch file at <a href="http://www.cobb.uk.net/openwrt/openwrt-stunnel-patches">http://www.cobb.uk.net/openwrt/openwrt-stunnel-patches</a> makes the necessary edits to configure and configure.ac and creates a script called openwrt-configure.&nbsp; Edit openwrt-configure to match your own needs, make sure you have correctly created the SSL directory and then run the following commands:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod +x openwrt-configure
./openwrt-configure
make</code></pre></div><p>On one of my systems (with newer version of automake) I found I had to run the following commands before ./openwrt-configure:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>aclocal
