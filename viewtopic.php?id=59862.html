					<p>I agree that the DGN3500 blob file name does not seem to agree with (what I&#039;m assuming is) the version string, however it does with the other vendor supplied blobs:</p><p>BT:<br />AR9_447B01.bin contains &quot;@(#)4.4.7.B.0.1&quot;</p><p>ZyXEL:<br />dsl_ar9_firmware_adsl_b-04.04.06.03.00.02.bin contains &quot;@(#)4.4.6.3.0.2&quot;</p><p>so that seems like a build/packaging snafu by Netgear.</p><p>Using BT&#039;s version seemed prudent in my situation (BT CPE, BT owned DSLAM, non-BT ISP), which I have been doing for a couple of weeks. My experience with 4.4.7.B.0.1 is that sync stability has been much improved, however sync rate reduced noticeably (22000ish to 20.389 Mb/s).</p><p>The Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H firmware may be the source of &quot;@(#)4.5.4.9.1.1&quot;, but I wasn&#039;t able to dismantle that one using binwalk etc.</p>									</div>
