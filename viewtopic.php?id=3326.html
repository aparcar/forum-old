					<p>Hi,</p><p>I believe I can manage doing the electronic mods for the serial ports and the package parts too. </p><p>Next thing, this is where I need some guidance, Compiling/building a package which will read data from a serial port. </p><p>I found the C code, which seems simple enough and lightweight - <a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Open2300/DownloadFiles">http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Op â€¦ nloadFiles</a>.</p><p>I have no Linux box unless you count the hacked Buffalo Station <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LinkStation_General/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LinkStation_General/</a>, so I installed the SDK on the MAC (tiger). Don&#039;t know if this will do the job? It has all the development tools on it. </p><p>Maybe someone could compile the simple C files, any help appreciated. I think it would be a nice additon to OpenWrt project.</p><p>thanks</p><p>Gavin Lyons</p><p>Ramsau am&nbsp; Dachstein, Austria <a href="http://www.i386.com/webcams/?cam=wm-cam">http://www.i386.com/webcams/?cam=wm-cam</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i386</strong> on 20 Nov 2005, 11:31)</p>

					<p>I tried the &#039;make clean&#039; however the OS X gives malloc errors in the virtual memory and then Stop.&nbsp; - Which I think is not good. </p><p>I have old PIII box so I think I could install FreeBSD 6.0. Would this be alright?</p><p>So a package seems to have a Config.in, Makefile, .patch and .control file.&nbsp; I presume the .control is to tell the compiler how to get the source and header files.</p><p>Seems a little complicated to make a simple &#039;Hello World&#039;. But I&#039;m no Linux expert.;-(&nbsp; The files for WS2300 are simple C and header files. </p><p>Is there a simpler way of compiling instead off make a package, maybe a simple module?</p><br /><br /><p>Vielen Danke,<br />Gavin :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i386</strong> on 20 Nov 2005, 13:07)</p>
