					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I really need your help here, been trying and trying and it&#039;s driving me nuts :s</p><p>I&#039;m simply trying to compile a simple C program for my atheros based router (TL-WR740N).</p><p>The packages in: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … /packages/</a> work fine on the router</p><p>So I supposed the SDK in the parent folder should work fine to cross compile (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/OpenWrt-SDK-ar71xx-for-Linux-x86_64-gcc-linaro">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … gcc-linaro</a>)</p><p>And hence I downloaded the SDK to my linux, made a simple helloworld and tried to (make V=99) it, but it keeps producing an error (which is related to the gcc compiler in the staging bin folder not being able to run)</p><p>No matter how much I try, it seems I can&#039;t compile my source with this SDK.</p><p>When I try to compile with this SDK (<a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/8.09.2/ar71xx/OpenWrt-SDK-ar71xx-for-Linux-i686.tar.bz2">http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/8.09.2/ar71 … 86.tar.bz2</a>) it compiles fine, but the executable doesn&#039;t work on the router</p><p>So it seems I must compile with the Linux-x86_64 sdk to be able to run the executable on the router. However, it won&#039;t compile on my linux box (tried fedora and mandriva and won&#039;t compile on both). Is it because my pc is 32 while the SDK is 64 bits?</p><p>I got the instructions (particularly the makefile from: <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php?id=openwrt_coding)">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/dok … rt_coding)</a></p><p>Is it something wrong in the makefile?</p><p>Please help guys, sooooooo appreciated!</p>									</div>
