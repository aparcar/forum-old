					<p>Hi,</p><p>This could be very trivial but i couldn&#039;t find any solution so far. I&#039;m using openwrt on some PCEngines ALIX boad with 1gb CF. In my application i need to log some data. At the moment I&#039;m creating an ext image that is 500Mb. However this approach is quite uncomfortable since i need sever around 300s to burn the image on the CF (using dd). The problem is that at the moment I&#039;ve making several change to the software so I need to burn the CF many times. </p><p>Is there anybody on the forum that had the same problem? If so any hint to the solution is appreciated.</p><p>Thanks<br />R.</p>									</div>

					<p>How does the time to transfer the image to the CF-Card relate to the thread topic?<br />If you want an additional partition on the CF, create it with fdisk.<br />Additionally, use a faster CF, card reader and/or USB 2.0 to decrease transfer time.</p><p>But anyway, I wouldn&#039;t use openwrt on an ALIX board, as long as there is no simple way to install upgrades and security fixes (if those fixes are available!).<br />I have mine running ubuntu server (with a generic kernel!), and there&#039;s enough RAM and CPU for it.<br />And upgrades are as simple as &quot;aptitude update; aptitude full-upgrade&quot; :-)</p>									</div>
