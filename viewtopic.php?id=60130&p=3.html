					<p><strong>@netomx:</strong></p><p>ty for the hint!<br />I was just copying the listed packages out of the config.diff of 15.05. v9, without knowing/taking into account that the base of the used trunk version may differ from that / the base package would be listed there too. That&#039;s interesting, maybe i&#039;ll work out the correct packages, a bit more space on my device wouldn&#039;t be to bad for playing around, + i&#039;ve got a very hard time getting into VIM (-: i rather scp the stuff back and forth.</p><p>Concerning my usage so far, everything works nice. I&#039;m running the bin as a &quot;hardware firewall&quot; via PPPOE, wifi works so far, signal strength seems to be the same as with the original firmware, dhcp seems to work.</p><p>If the compile from source would be really a way to contribute something on the journey to an official version, that would be something worth the effort i think. Somewhere i read that the FREIFUNK project has a working v10 compile in testing out there too, i think.</p><p><strong>edit:</strong> i removed the link to this &quot;double-packaged&quot; bin from the wiki!
