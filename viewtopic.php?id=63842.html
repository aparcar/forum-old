					<p>Hi,</p><p>there are some really interesting solutions available now for personnal use but more of them need to have Node.js to execute them.</p><p>One of the best is a perfect local/home Cloud service.<br />It is name Cozy and it has also a lighter solution named Cozy light (to just install what you really need).<br /><a href="https://cozy.io/en/">https://cozy.io/en/</a><br /><a href="https://cozy-labs.github.io/cozy-light/">https://cozy-labs.github.io/cozy-light/</a></p><p>But as said it needs Node.js.</p><p>Could you then create a package that allow us to install Node.js as an OpenWRT package ?<br />That will allow us to use Cozy as personnal/family cloud service.</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-) </p><p>P.S. : Having Node.js available as a package could also allow us to use the interesting Home Automation solution named Gladyproject : <a href="http://gladysproject.com/en/">http://gladysproject.com/en/</a></p>									</div>
