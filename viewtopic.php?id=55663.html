					<p>How I did to unbrick my TP-WR841nd_v8.2.</p><p>When I got it, i downloaded the latest firmware from tplink web site.<br />Flashed the new firmware into the router.<br />My taught was, there maybe is a new boot mtd part in tp-links <br />own new firmware. Because it&#039;s named with boot.</p><p>Afterward i just want to test to flash ddwrt or openwrt.<br />Now my big problem appears, the ddwrt didn&#039;t boot up. <br />It&#039;s not my cup of tea. *lol*<br />I have to buy some uart ttl usb adapter with some china copy<br />of ftdi chip. It&#039;s not easy to find the right one.</p><p>Tested first with wireshark to see if something happening on the Ethernet cable.<br />Yes... I did see some arp request from my router. Asking if someone has<br />ip 192.169.0.66 from mac address ba:be:fa:ce:08:41, yes babeface *lol*.<br />This mac address was first assign. Not my ordinary correct mac address.</p><p>I used my Linux Ubuntu desktop pc.</p><p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; First to stop network manager, that are annoying with open / close the Ethernet connection.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo service network-manager stop</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Edit the interfaces file.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; iface eth0 inet static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; address 192.168.0.66<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; netmask 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; gateway 192.168.0.86</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bring up the interface eth0 manually.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo ifup eth0</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Added the funny mac address to be static.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo arp -s 192.168.0.86 ba:be:fa:ce:08:41</p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Installed dnsmasq just for the tftp server.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo apt-get install dnsmasq</p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Disabled the dnsmasq to startup when my ubuntu start.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo update-rc.d -f dnsmasq remove</p><p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Make my own lab directory, downloaded the tplink zip file into this directory. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Renamed the org firmware file to tp link&#039;s own recovery name.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can see in the log of dnsmasq file name on screen what file name<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the router searching for.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; mkdir tplink &amp;&amp; cd tplink<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; unzip -j TL-WR841ND_V8_140724.zip<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mv wr841nv8_en_3_15_9_up_boot(140724).bin wr841nv8_tp_recovery.bin</p><p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; Easy way just startup dnsmasq as program.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sudo dnsmasq --no-daemon --no-hosts --no-resolv --dhcp-range=192.168.0.86,192.168.0.86,12h --interface=eth0 --enable-tftp --tftp-root=$(pwd)</p><p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; Turn the router on, and press the reset key directly afterwards.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tried to hold the reset key in when turned the router on, but this didn&#039;t work.</p><p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now i see the router get&#039;s it&#039;s firmware from the tftp server and boot&#039;s up normaly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes my bricked router, isn&#039;t broken. It&#039;s unbroken.</p><p><strong>I have seen some problems with some network cards that don&#039;t sync up quickly enough, when you turn the router on.<br />So if you have some old Ethernet hub och switch in between you get better and easier result. </strong></p><p>Looking at the firmware file with binwalk i get this version of U-Boot.<br />U-Boot 1.1.4 (Jul 24 2014 - 17:19:59</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>patrikg</strong> on 5 Feb 2018, 11:20)</p>
