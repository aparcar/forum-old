					<p>Hello,</p><p>i have a simple question. Does OpenWrt use the swap function from Linux on default or is it disabled?<br />I need to put OpenWrt as read-only but if there is a swap function i need to disable it. So my question is just if there is a swap function on OpenWrt and if yes how to disable it.</p><p>I use Openwrt DD-r48151 with some compiled programs on an Raspberry Pi B+.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Patrick</p>									</div>

					<p>No, swap is not used by default; it would destroy the flash in the device. To be sure, just execute &quot;free&quot; to see if there is any swap available, or &quot;cat /proc/swaps&quot; to see which files or devices are being used as swap.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you need to put OpenWRT into read only mode, why would you need to disable swap if it was enabled?</p><p>Since swap doesn&#039;t hold any data over a boot loop cycle I fail to see why disabling swap is any better than starting with fresh swap space after each reboot.</p><p>What are you trying to do?</p>									</div>

That&#039;s the exact reason why swap is disabled by default and no logging is persisted. There&#039;s close to no write operation going on.</p><p>I had the impression you were trying to prevent anybody from adjust your routers configuration and thus want your flash memory to not accept write calls.</p>									</div>
