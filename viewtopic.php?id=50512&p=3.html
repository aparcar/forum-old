					<p>Hello to everybody. I bought yesterday an airmusic nw11. The machine was working great. I tried to update firmware from wifi, and although i get no error messages, when i rebooted i cannot find the ssid. The machine is powering up, and the wifi led blinks 3 times, and thats it. If you thinks there is a way to make it work again, please tell me also what tools do i need to proceed.<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally managed to use the USB stick in the device for playing music.</p><p>I&#039;m running firmware version FW:1.1.01-A21(A.01).</p><p>I found that if I was connecting my Ipad to the Airmusic router.

					<p>Hi,<br />I ordered this small mediaplayer and think to connect a 500Gb HD on the USB port.<br />Do you think it could be possible to enable an NFS (or ftp or ssh ) server on it, to be able to upload media through the network?<br />Any idea is welcome.<br />Thanks.<br />[EDIT] Toy received... Thank to Aldo.Dekker have enabled the ushare server and I can say it works like a charm on a 16Gb USB Key. Sound is very good. No issue at all. But on my 500Gb HD it fails very often, it&#039;s unusable (may be not enough memory?).<br />I think it&#039;s better to buy a Raspberry even it&#039;s little bit more expensive.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>domtor0</strong> on 13 Feb 2015, 01:40)</p>

					<p>Please forgive me my noobish ignorance, but is this streamer suitable for turning an old audio system into internet radio receiver? I&#039;m not interested in playing local mp3s via wifi or USB.

No experience on that.<br />I don&#039;t see a big difference in price between Hame A1 (i suppose this is the one you&#039;re referring to) and the NW11, of course if you then use a 1$ usb soundcard it would sound bad, and if you want to use a good usb soundcard you can easily pay a lot more.<br />The only thing that you can be sure is that the Hame solution is more flexible and can be adapted to different situation, while NW11, M1 or A900 are very stuck on the few option you can use.

I mean, I see them recommended for similar projects all the time. I&#039;ve even seen recommendations to add one of them to RPi because it&#039;s an upgrade to the integrated sound.

					<p>Well it&#039;s not real Hame but it&#039;s clone. But has advantage of double RAM (32MB). It only costs <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/WHOSA-Mini-Portable-3G-4G-MiFi-Wireless-N-USB-WiFi-Hotspot-JU-Router-AP-150Mbps-Wlan/1829126906.html">$9.90 on AliExpress</a>. Adding $1 souncard makes it $11 whis is exactly half of NW11.<br />If I&#039;m not mistaken Hackru is Lolipop on Mysku.ru. Then there is a comprehensive review by him of the clone in question.

					<p>Samaras, based on your previous posts I assume you use the same firmware version as I do. </p><p>I had problems with one of the previous firmware versions. Which produced a lot of dropouts, I must admit that I still have dropouts, but very short and only once or twice when I&#039;m listening for hours. I&#039;m using my Ipad as music player and I think the Ipad is sometimes busy or the network is having problems, I do not believe it is always the Airmusic device.</p><p>I had a problem though with keeping Ushare available so a I added to crontab a command to start it every minute. It now works fine with my 32 Gb usb memory card. I imagine that a hard drive is sometimes too slow, but this might also depend on the drive and its own drive cache.</p><br /><p>The command &#039;contrab -l&quot; returns:</p><p>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59 * * * * /etc/init.d/ushare start</p><p>So every minute contrab starts ushare, this did not affect the number of dropouts.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Aldo.Dekker</strong> on 6 Mar 2015, 11:29)</p>
