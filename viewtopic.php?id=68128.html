					<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>I am trying to install OpenWRT on a Raspberry Pi 3 to build a router with two WiFi Interfaces.<br />Wifi0 should be the onboard Wifi, Wifi1 is a USB Stick with RTL8188EUS chipset.</p><p>For Raspberry Pi 3 Support I would have to use a trunk Version because the needed patches were done after 15.05.1, but there is no build available for BCM2710 in that folder, only bcm2708 generic and that one does not boot. Also bcm2709 of 15.05.1 does not boot, not even after replacing fixup bootcode.bin, fixup.dat, and start.elf with the ones from raspbian.<br />So i found no way to boot a original Openwrt build on RPI3. Are RPI3 Builds (bcm2710) available somewhere?</p><p>I found some 3rd party RPi3 Image called Avalon 6 but i am not sure if this is trustworthy.<br />I tested it, it does work but it does not recognize that RTL8818EUS Wifi Dongle. Which drivers or packets are needed for this one?</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Note that a RTL8188 chip exists in both PCI and USB versions.&nbsp; The &quot;rtl8188&quot; driver is only for the PCI chip.&nbsp; The driver for the USB version is actually &quot;rtl8192cu&quot;.<br /><a href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/rtl819x">https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/use â€¦ rs/rtl819x</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think the rtl8192cu is the correct driver for the rtl8188eus, in the link posted above this driver supports the 8188cu not the 8188eu, in the link support for the 8188eu is with driver 8xxxu, but I can confirm this to be not working with openwrt 15.05<br />Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>If you use 15.05 version with kernel 3.18 its possible that not work, because its works 4.3+ kernel version.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>juanelfrancisco</strong> on 4 Feb 2017, 01:09)</p>
