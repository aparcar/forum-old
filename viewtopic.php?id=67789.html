					<p>Hey guys, I&#039;d rather be that guy that asks dumb questions, than remain dumb. So I&#039;m curious exactly how I can connect remotely to the router.</p><p>So you understand my level of skill... I understand how to use the router, and access the configuration screen so that I can make changes. What I&#039;m talking about is actually accessing the Linux back-end to these routers.</p><br /><p>There are a number of super-cheap 1-2 port routers using OpenWRT on Amazon and eBay, so I don&#039;t mind if I totally trash one of them. But ultimately I&#039;m interested in just accessing the Linux side of these routers, so I can perform basic functions like upgrading or flashing the firmware. </p><p>I&#039;ve been reading the OpenWRT Wiki, and I see a lot of people running Linux commands and such. Am I to understand that these commands are being run locally on the router, rather than on an end-point that happens to be running Linux?</p><p>Do I simply need to SSH into the router from somewhere else on the network? Does the device get mounted as storage or something through the USB port?</p><p>Thanks guys... I really appreciate any advice or direction. To be clear, I don&#039;t really HAVE to reflash or update firmware... I&#039;m just interested in figuring out how to do it... the most complicated way possible, so I understand the nuts and bolts.</p><p>Thanks!!!</p>									</div>
