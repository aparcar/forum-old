					<p>I just bought a TP-Link Archer C7 because I thought OpenWRT worked with it. I went to the help page (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/ar â€¦ c7-wdr7500</a>) to try to install it but now I am so confused. With my previous router I was able to use the firmware update page from the stock firmware but it doesn&#039;t look like I can do that with this router.</p><p>I have the Archer C7 (US) version 2.0<br />My serial # starts with 216A.</p><p>Is there some simple instructions I can follow to get OpenWRT on the router?</p><p>And I assume everything will work fine with OpenWRT on this router? Or is there another firmware (like LEDE) I should be using instead?</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>									</div>
