					<p>Can somebody help with BlueZ in OpenWrt, please? <br />Whole day I&#039;m trying to connect my NOKIA phone over bluetooth (using MSI MS-6967 bluetooth USB stick) to my ASUS WL-500g (with OpenWrt RC5 firmware). I want to use internet connection in my phone.</p><p>Problem I have is when I connect my phone to ASUS, I get this message:<br />pppd is unable to open the /dev/ppp device. You need to create the /dev/ppp device node by executing the following command as root: ^Imknod /dev/ppp c 108 0</p><p>But when I type &quot;mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0&quot; I got reply &quot;-ash: mknod: not found&quot;.<br />I try everything, but nothing works. Please, help me, I think this is last what I must resolve.</p><p>Thanks for answers,<br /> Cooper, Czech Republic</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cooper.zl</strong> on 8 May 2006, 22:23)</p>

					<p>I want to thank you Samot.<br />Your post was great, everything what I need was there. I made some changes and now is everything working.</p><p>And to the your first sentence: Sorry for posting in &#039;Development&#039;, this was accident.
