					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am trying to set up &quot;ipvanish&quot; on my WRT1900AC. I am very much a &quot;noob&quot; on this.<br />The configuration is quite...extensive, and makes reference to a field called...<br />verify-x509-name<br />Followed by the name of the server you are connecting to. I can see no references to this field in the OpenVPN setup.<br />They also have file extensions ending in &quot;.ovpn&quot;<br />Can we make use of these somehow? They seem to contain the configuration settings, but I don&#039;t know where to place this.</p><p>Thanks in advance<br />Steve</p>									</div>
