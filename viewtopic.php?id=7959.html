					<p>Oh dear, it turns out that a standard WP54G does <strong>not</strong> run OpenWrt. You need to buy a customised variant which has an extra chip.

					<p>HI everyone. thing is it quite late for this information. </p><p>The new version of Wp54 - 6E does not required the chip set in order to run Open WRT.</p><br /><p>i try it using Kamikaze Forked version from Compex it works fine. And the new method they use is much more easier. need to upload 1 file only instead of 4 files before. </p><p>Additional informatin </p><p>For some old board serial Cant be used with PoE or else it will spoilt the serial console. But for the new version shouldnt be a problem .</p><p>Jtag is not require if the board is not dead. You can always use serial console to debud the problem. I think it is more saver to do so. </p><p>I get both WP18/54 with me and solve some of the troublesom problem rise by many ppl in the forum. SO u can pm me if you find the problem so. </p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>Cheers </p><p>Kevin Fr.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DD7</strong> on 20 Aug 2007, 12:21)</p>

					<p>According to what they told me, the OpenWrt development is working hard to fully support WP54 and all adm5120 chipset based boards in the future versions. I hope in the next 7.07 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />At now, WP54 is still forked from OpenWrt project.</p>									</div>

					<p>GGP81 : </p><p>Sorry for the later reply. </p><p>I receive the Mod file to create the Own firmware. </p><p>And Changes made by Compex for the Mod<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Change the mtd partition names to &quot;kernel&quot; and &quot;rootfs&quot; so firmware can run<br />Use proper MAC addresses for the ethernet interface<br />Generate proper image file for Myloader<br />Create a bridge for the LAN and WLAN<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>So actually not much change from the realease version. They only make it more suitable for the board. <br />Thats going to be better i think so it is suit the board.<br />Most of the fork/PORK version (hahaha) changes is done in the code so alot of changes is done in the main coding. (Correct me if iam wrong)&nbsp; </p><br /><p>so the bin file that i receive is made to make the board run in the better way. <br />I tested to 3 days already with no problem at all. wait to see more longer.</p>									</div>
