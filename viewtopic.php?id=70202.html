					<p>There are a lot of posts of difficulties switching boot partitions using the on/off switch method.&nbsp; The following method works for me EVERY time, on WRT1200, WRT1900ACV1, WRT1900ACS and WRT3200ACM.</p><p>The trick to the timing is to watch the power LED.&nbsp; During a normal power on the power LED will turn on, then after a bit will begin blinking.&nbsp; You can use a serial connection to see how much margin the procedure below allows (it gives at least a second of timing error for the power-off portion).&nbsp; Start with the power switch off, then switch on.&nbsp; Watch the power LED:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Power LED:&nbsp; on (a few seconds)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Power LED:&nbsp; off (a second or two)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Power LED:&nbsp; on (immediately when the power light turns on, flip the power switch off)</p><p>That is 1 cycle of the 3 required to revert to the other partition.&nbsp; Repeat the above procedure two more times, making sure to flip the switch off as soon as the power LED comes on the second time.</p><p>The fourth time you turn the power switch on you can let the device boot and it should boot into the other partition.</p><p>Please add to the wiki!</p>									</div>
