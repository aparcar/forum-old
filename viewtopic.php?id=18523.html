					<p>I had the same problem and after n hours I understood that sometimes Linux is too smart, at least in my case.<br/>The problem is due to the fact the data are not sent sequentially and this causes adams not to acknowledge them, in turn this causes<br/>linux to resend the data but if&nbsp; F-RTO, an enhanced recovery algorithm for TCP retransmission timeouts, is activated the delay increases to 2min<br/>and so you end up with sending 256 effective bytes every 2 minutes...<br/>Switch off rto by<br/>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_frto<br/>and so everything works :-)</p>									</div>
