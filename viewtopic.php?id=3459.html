					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently upgraded the firmware of my linksys to RC4. I&#039;ve set de nvram setting no_boot_swap=1, as hinted in the README. After reflashing, the webadmin works. It asked me for a rootpassword, but i get an error. This was because the 2ffs partition wasn&#039;t created yet. I gave the command &quot;firstboot&quot;, and I could set the password. Before this i have set the vram setting back. But after this (setting the root password), telnet didn&#039;t work anymore (which is normal), but ssh worked neither. SSH gave &quot;connection refused&quot;. I rebooted the router. Then it seems that the 2ffs partition was gone again, en the story starts from the beginning. After uploading RC3 again, i still had the same problem, which is never had before.</p><p>Can anybody help me?</p><p>grtz. Daan</p>									</div>

					<p>...in the hint it says something about run firstboot, if you have changed the no_boot_swap variable (or change it manually), maybe that is related...<br />to the problem with the password, if you start the router in failsafe, you should be able to telnet into it.<br />failsafe is described somewhere in the wiki</p><p>chris</p>									</div>
