					<p>I just received my new WRTSL54GS. Ordered it from eBay, coz it is not sold here. Royally messed it up. Pls help. Here is what I did</p><br /><p>1) Connected Power Adapter and booted router. Router Booted and everything was fine. <br />2) Few seconds later there was smoke from the Power Adapter. Switched off router and well realized 120V != 220V. DOH!!<br />3) Plugged in another compatible power adapter of my old Netgear HUB.<br />4) Booted up router but it stays on &quot;Blinky Power LED mode&quot;</p><p>Now I started panicing as it has no warranty and shit. Tried the Linksys TFTP Method as well as the OpenWRT TFTP Method.</p><p>Finally had brains enough to attach a Serial Cable. Turns out I have Kernel Panic for some reason. Here is the output</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> 8011dc9c 8002d478 1003f000 80299f36 00000081 00000001 00000000 81cc10a4
