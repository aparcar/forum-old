					<p>Hi,<br />I would like to experiment with replacement of miniPci card in my asus. I was going to order Wistron Neweb CM9&nbsp; Atheros card. But I&#039;m a little worried about one thing:&nbsp; would the original ASUS pigtail cable be good enough ( long enough) or I need to do some soldering or order a new cable for the new card?<br />Does anyone have an expirience with Wistron cards?<br />Thanks a lot</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />well the hardware upgrade went ok even if I ran into a small problem. The original miniPCI is stuck to a kind of black &quot;sponge&quot; which is itself attached to the main board. I cut it off the original miniPCI carefully with a cutter and only then I could remove it.</p><p>.The software installation was ok. I first installed Kamikaze 7.09 but I had some random seg faults quite often. You can find some posts about this topic on the forum. I build myself the trunk version and it seems to be much more stable.<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15230">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15230</a></p><p>There might be some issue with the signal quality which is a bit poor. Again, there are some topics about this in the Kamikaze forum.<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15207">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=15207</a></p><p>Regards,<br />Tex</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tex-Twil</strong> on 11 Apr 2008, 10:49)</p>
