					<p>Hello,<br/>I need to monitor, how much traffic the services on my router generate. I have tried several solutions (bandwidthd, bmon, iftop ...) but so far none of these does specifically what I need.<br/>I have found collectd + iptables plugin, but I don&#039;t know how to configure it. I am missing some real world examples. I have tried to add rules using LuCI, but for me its totally chaotic and generates a lot of graphs I don&#039;t want to have and none of those I do want.</p><p>Outgoing interface of my router is called 3g-wan3g. Lets say I want to monitor outgoing and incoming traffic for this interface using tcp port 5432 (postgresql) and udp port 1194 (openvpn). I want to have 2 graphs - 1 for postgresql (incoming / outgoing traffic) and 1 for openvpn (in/out). How can I do this? Which iptables rules should I add and how do I tell collectd to monitor specifically these?</p><p>Please, could you provide me a foolproof example? Thank you.</p>									</div>
