					<p>I noticed that kmod must exactly match the kernel version in the firmware. I did try &#039;opkg install&#039; with both automatically downloaded and manually selected kmod-macvlan so that the downloaded macvlan package can be closest in time to your releases. However, the trouble I found is, at least kmod-macvlan module requires not only kernel of same major version, but also of exactly same minor version include hash string, e.g.&nbsp; the whole 3.18.17-1-5dcb66d04a38219f7fd91c748f0e9a32 must match. It&#039;s impossible for me to get a macvlan package fully matching kernel versions in your compilations.</p><p>As you mentioned, I can compile my own firmware using your build environment, but it&#039;s much less convenient than your existing releases, after all, macvlan is my only additional need. Kmod-maclvan is as tiny as 9k, could you integrate it into your releases?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your kind attention.<br />After each reboot only the wan and wan6 have public IPv6. Then I click &quot;connect&quot; for IPv6 on the lan interface. The propagation of the IPv6 is well on clients. The routing fails because of a default in nexthop management by the Freebox. A discussion is open to <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53160">users of the Freebox</a>.<br />As IPv6 has already worked with me, I wonder about the origin of the regrssion? Freebox or OpenWRT?</p>									</div>
