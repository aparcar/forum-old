					<p>To recap what is happening. If boot-wait is turned on, the CFE will try 5 times at boot to get a tftp image from the network. This is normal. If you try to send an image to the device at boot it will accept it, but it will not flash it to the device. This appears to be because the command the CFE uses to flash the image has an invalid argument in it.</p><p>Looking at this a bit closer. when I drop to the CFE&gt; prompt at boot with a serial console and type &#039;help flash&#039; I get this.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CFE&gt; help flash

  SUMMARY

     Update a flash memory device

  USAGE

     flash [options] filename [flashdevice]

     Copies data from a source file name or device to a flash memory device.
     The source device can be a disk file (FAT filesystem), a remote file
     (TFTP) or a flash device.  The destination device may be a flash or eeprom.
     If the destination device is your boot flash (usually flash0), the flash
     command will restart the firmware after the flash update is complete

  OPTIONS

     -noerase     Don&#039;t erase flash before writing
     -offset=*    Begin programming at this offset in the flash device
     -size=*      Size of source device when programming from flash to flash
     -ctheader    Check header of CyberTAN
     -noheader    Override header verification, flash binary without checking-mem;Use memory as source instead of a device

                  flash -ctheader : flash1.trx  (upgrade code.bin/code2.bin)
                  flash -ctheader : flash1.trx2 (upgrade code.bin/code2.bin)
                  flash -noheader : flash1.trx  (upgrade linux.trx)

*** command status = 0
CFE&gt;</code></pre></div><p>Notice that at the end of the line that starts with &#039;-noheader&#039;, there is also a &#039;-mem; ....&#039;<br />So it looks like it is supposed to be a valid command but it is not working as it should.<br />I dumped the CFE to a CFE.BIN file and was searching through it with a hex editor. The line used to flash the device is embedded in the CFE. But it doesn&#039;t look to be in the nvram or in an environment variable. <br />Also I am very afraid to try to build and flash my own CFE to it because I cannot find the JTAG access to this router.</p>									</div>

					<p>The only thing I can think of is that A fixed CFE would need to be flashed to the device.</p><p>I wonder if we could <br />1. dump the CFE to a file<br />2. hexedit it to put spaces where the &#039;-mem&#039; is<br />3. flash it back to the device and try again.<br />I dont want to try it on this specific device because of the lack of jtag. If I can find time I will look into trying it on my spare wrt54gl.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tpwn3r</strong> on 21 Oct 2008, 01:57)</p>

					<p>The jtag pin out has been documented on the wiki but I do not think the support for the flash chip is complete. <br />Last I heard was that the software <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=22655">tjtag</a> can read the flash chip but it cannot write. I have not spent much time trying this myself so I am not sure. <br />I have <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=245067#245028">dumped the cfe</a> and viewed it with a hex editor. I believe I seen the command to change but thats as far as I went. For now on this front the jtag software needs to have working write support for this. </p><p>I haven&#039;t contacted Linksys myself.<br />Would a firmware upgrade from Linksys replace the CFE? <br />I don&#039;t think it would but I could be wrong.<br />What else could they do besides replace the unit?</p>									</div>
