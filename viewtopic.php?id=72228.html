					<p>Hi all</p><p>I have a NetGear N150 (WNR1000v3)</p><p>I found the firmware on the OpenWRT page and installed it via my router login page I was given a message saying this will take 1.5 minutes do not disturb it. I went out the room and came back and my browser was showing a could not connect message and now the router power led is oange and cannot connect for wifi or ethernet. What has happened and how can I fix this.</p><p>Thanks for all the help, I&#039;m new to this so maybe should have researched it a bit more before going ahead.</p>									</div>
