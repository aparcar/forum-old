					<p>Hey Everyone,</p><p>I am designing a front-end to Asterisk for OpenWrt, and I would like for people to not be able to click to reveal VoIP provider passwords on my interface. I quickly discovered that using the .password = true flag, one can make a field a &quot;password&quot; field where dots mask the password.</p><p>However, I would like to go a step further and take away the Hide/Reveal password button which is available to the right of the password field and allows one to unmask the password.</p><p>Yes, you may say that the router should be protected by a good password, etc. However, I would like to prevent somebody from checking out a password if the user gets up and walks away from the browser, forgetting to logout or relying on the auto-logout mechanism. What&#039;s more, I don&#039;t really see the interface I am writing as a &quot;reference&quot; for forgotten passwords or anything, so I don&#039;t see the point to the functionality in this case.</p><p>Many thanks to anybody who has a quick reply to this!</p><p>Iordan</p>									</div>

					<p>The template needs to be changed to make this button optional. Keep in mind that this will provide no security though, a simple ctrl-u or firebug can easily show the masked value.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Jow,</p><p>Thanks for the response. Is there no way to avoid populating the HTML source with the password, or would this entail that a Save&amp;Apply would set the password to an empty field? Can you think, off the top of your mind, for any workaround that I can try coding into the templates?</p><p>Outside changing the templates, is there some way to put up a text box and a button, and upon clicking the button, whatever text was input into the said textbox would be grabbed and written to the configuration via a call to uci:set(), and uci:commit(&quot;section&quot;)? I can&#039;t think of how to grab text from a text-box which has been filled out but not &quot;saved&quot; into the UCI configuration, can you?</p><p>Thanks!!<br />Iordan</p>									</div>

					<p>You can do it like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>m = Map(...)

s = m:section(...)

some_secret_value = s:option(Value, ...)
some_secret_value.password = true -- to mask user input
some_secret_value.rmempty = false -- to prevent a delete of the whole option if nothing was entered

function some_secret_value.cfgvalue(self, section)
    return &quot;&quot; -- pretend that there is nothing in the config
end

function some_secret_value.write(self, section, value)
    -- check user value against value in config, trigger write if they differ
    local orig = m:get(section, self.option)
    if value and #value &gt; 0 and orig ~= value then
        Value.write(self, section, value)
    end
end</code></pre></div><p>The code above will always produce an empty password input, regardless of whether there is a config value behind or not.<br />If the user enters something it is compared against the value in the config, if it differs (config was empty or different) the user value is set.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Jow,</p><p>Many thanks, I&#039;ll try your proposed implementation as soon as I get a chance. So basically, it looks like there are a couple of standard methods called &quot;cfgvalue&quot; and &quot;write&quot; which we are overloading here, right? The former gets called by the framework when the page is being loaded, and the latter gets called when the page is being &quot;Save&amp;Apply&quot;-ed.</p><p>Are there any more methods that can be overridden like that to alter the behavior of the interface, or is this pretty much it?</p><p>The reason I want to have this kind of password sinking functionality is that an interface where somebody can simply click a button when I have my page turned and read in plain-text my Google Talk password doesn&#039;t pass my basic safety test <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Iordan</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes it is. </p><p>m.uci:get() maps directly to the uci api get function while m:get() is a convenience shortcut.</p><p>m:get(&quot;section&quot;, &quot;option&quot;)&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; m.uci:get(m.config, &quot;section&quot;, &quot;option&quot;)</p>									</div>

					<p>I see. What I meant was whether there is any difference in the end result, and since it&#039;s just a short-cut there would be no difference.</p><p>Thanks for all the help and explanations!</p>									</div>
