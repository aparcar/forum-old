					<p>Hi<br />I bought a WR841 and flashed it with OpenWRT SquashFS. I then decided I would rather stick with the original firmware, so downloaded it from the DD-WRT forums (it was the first place I could find it).</p><p>I performed this operation using WinSCP and telnet but I think I may have either used an incorrect image or power cycled the device too early.</p><p>Currently the router will power on like this:<br />Power LED On -&gt; All LEDs On -&gt; All but Power LED Off<br />So it ends up with only the power LED on. Is it possible to recover the router from this state? I attempted resetting it by connecting to the WAN socket and rapidly pressing the reset button, but this didn&#039;t do much.</p><p>Is it possible to restore the device using serial? I know there are guides but I don&#039;t want to spend any more money buying serial cables if it won&#039;t work anyway.</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide!</p>									</div>

					<p>Just got back from holiday and my DKU-5 cable has arrived. Just cut it and only found 3 wires - yellow, white, and green. I don&#039;t have a multimeter so I am unable to check voltages. Is there a known layout for this set of 3 wires?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, well through trial and error I found green was GND, yellow is connected to router&#039;s Tx and white is router&#039;s Rx. Got connected through PuTTY and received expected messages. Now onto recovering firmware!</p>									</div>

					<p>HI Guys,</p><p>I just got here from Google trying to figure out how to unbrick my wr841n v8.4 TP link router. <br />I wanted to try openwrt and was uninstalling dd-wrt. Thing is, I tried to first get back to original stockfirmware from dd-wrt. After rebooting the router, I was still able to see dd-wrt on the router. Much to no success, I decided to follow a guide to uninstall dd-wrt through winscp but got the MTD error and boom! Bricked my router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Anyway, I have this wire lying with me <a href="http://www.ebay.in/itm/CP2102-USB-2-0-to-TTL-UART-SERIAL-CONVERTER-ARDUINO-PROGRAMMER-MODULE-ADAPTER-/281384691630?pt=IN_Projectors_Accessories&amp;hash=item4183d5a7ae">http://www.ebay.in/itm/CP2102-USB-2-0-t â€¦ 4183d5a7ae</a> and thought I would be able to get into the system again.</p><p>Firstly, Is this the correct wire? Secondly, how do I get on with using these wires to get back to stock firmwarE?</p><p>Really looking forward to some help as I don&#039;t want to buy a new one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Roady, you need usb ttl converter, so this one is OK. Read about serial console method In openwrt wiki. You need stripped firmware which you must upload through tftp server. <br />Googled user roypaun in dd-wrt forum. I helped him to unbrick 8.4. It his topic I uploaded firmware you need to flash.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you must buy 3 pin connector. It is pretty cheap. Don&#039;t worry about 6 pins of your adapter.&nbsp; You need only Tx, Rx, GND. connection must be Tx-Rx, Rx-Tx, GND-GND. DON&#039;T USE OTHER PINS ! In my experience with V8 you don&#039;t need to solder. Just touch the pin connector to router&#039;s pins and you will be OK.</p><p>Did you damage router&#039;s plastic when you open it ?</p>									</div>
