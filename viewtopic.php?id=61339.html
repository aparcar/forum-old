					<p>Hi,<br />I just installed openwrt 15.05 on my tl-wr851n v10, because I was having some troubles with the original firmware (WAN port wouldn&#039;t set its speed to 100mbps, only 10mbps, my internet connection is 100mbps up 100mbps down). However, installing openwrt didn&#039;t fix the problem, I&#039;m very very new to openwrt so I couldn&#039;t find any options to actually address this issue with (something like force set the WAN speed to 100mbps, auto-negotiation settings). I hope you guys can help me with that.</p><p>I reset every single resettable device connected to the internet, my speed when connected directly to the modem is 100 up 100 down, all of my cables are Cat 5E, both wired and wireless connections to the router have this problem, both my laptop and my phone only have 10mbps connections when connected to the router (laptop has a gbit port).</p><p>Also, when I was fiddling around with cables and the VLAN settings (I deleted the &quot;untagged&quot; things to see what would happen, reconnected the WAN cable) and I got a 100mbps down and 0.21mbps up connection on my laptop and phone. It&#039;s something, but half-duplex.</p><p>I have not tried different cables from the modem to the router, though, but that same cable works for my laptop so I didn&#039;t think it would be the cause of the problems.</p>									</div>
