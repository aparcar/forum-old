					<p>Hello !</p><p>I am announcing a 5 EUR Paypal reward for someone that comes up with a working configuration solution (please paste the usable config files below, since I am unable to figure that out by myself) for this issue. Due to a high amount of posts in this forum, this might motivate someone for assistance.</p><p>I have a TP-LINK WR841ND (Ver. 10.0) router, with (probably latest version) OpenWRTs customized firmware for the &quot;city-mesh&quot; project network, and I would like to tune some settings in the config files.</p><p>To further explain what I&#039;d like to achieve is:<br />Imagine the scenario like if I would have a dedicated hardware dumb-hub-switch device, where I would plug in the existing WR841ND Wi-Fi router into port 1 of the dedicated dumb-hub-switch device and a PC (for my home network) into port 2 of the dedicated hub-switch device. In this case I would be able to use my home subnet (which happens to be a public subnet visible on the Internet, not a NAT-ed subnet) on a PC + use a &quot;city-mesh&quot; network on the router without a problem. But, the situation is that I do NOT have/own this dedicated dumb-hub-switch device, so I wanted to achieve the same result by using the existing &quot;city-mesh&quot; WR841ND router 4x LAN ports to act as if they were acting in a dumb-hub-switch device mode. Currently the existing WR841ND router has 1x WAN and 4x LAN ports. The IP on the WAN port comes from my home network, and over it the router syncs via OpenVPN onto the &quot;city-mesh&quot; network and then all Wi-Fi traffic on the clients passes through OpenVPN onto the &quot;city-mesh&quot; network. After the configuration files will be modified/done in the right way, I wish to plug in the PC into one of the four LAN ports on the WR841ND and assign an IP from my home network to that PC. I hope this clarifies, what I want to achieve.</p><p>As you can see, I tried to change some values in the original config files to make it work, but it doesn&#039;t work. Down below I will paste the config files:</p><p>### 1.

					<p>Make wan a bridge and move eth0 into it.&nbsp; Anything you plug into any of the ethernet ports (wan or lan, since they are now in the same bridge) will go to your main router.&nbsp; This is directly equivalent to placing a dumb switch in the line between the mesh router and your main ISP router.</p><p>But it will then still be possible for users of the mesh to hit stuff on your LAN, since mesh users are necessarily forwarded to the wan side so they can use the internet.</p><p>To avoid that use the more involved solution of creating your own network, call it for example &quot;private&quot;.&nbsp; Connect eth0 to private.&nbsp; Give private a static IP that doesn&#039;t conflict with anything else and enable a DHCP server for your stuff.&nbsp; Create firewall rules so that private forwards to wan so you can use the internet.</p><p>This is identical to creating a guest network isolated from the other networks on the router.&nbsp; Instructions are already written up.</p><p>You do not need to alter the switch configuration or create VLANs unless you want the four LAN ports on the back of the router to act somehow different from each other. The default switch configuration simply dumb-switches them all together, which is what you usually want so you can plug in 4 LAN devices on the same network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 16 Dec 2016, 03:09)</p>

					<p>@mk24 are you sure this would not create even worse situation?</p><p>If you bridge two networks together then you get to dhcp servers running... and then how would you choose to which network you will connect?</p><p>Also you are openning your home network (which I guess you don&#039;t want anyone from the street to access)... because then anyone inside mesh netowork can access anything from your local network. This seams like bad idea to me.</p><p>Much better solution would be to go with to separate switch into two using vlans.</p>									</div>

					<p>WOW i never seen a setup like this before,OK i got a idea this will show how smart or how stupid i am setup your TP-LINK WR841ND (Ver. 10.0) like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr0P1CGG9FU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr0P1CGG9FU</a> if you can get that to work thin that will keep the city-mesh out of your net work plus you will have a DHCP server working on your side with lans and wireless if you get it to log on to city-mesh you will be going through a WWAN wireless wan.Thin install VPN support if you got the room on your router config the VPN and hope it all works if you get this to work,need to make a WIKI page so others can read it.I use a home mesh network I can log on to my nodes with smart phones lap tops bridge or client bridge routers, I don&#039;t know how this city-mesh is setup to work so all this mite be a waste of time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ckm</strong> on 17 Dec 2016, 15:57)</p>

					<p>I have done as suggested. But I am unable to ping the PC which is being plugged into the LAN port. Nmap will only show the IP+MAC address of the WAN interface (which I also cannot ping). Maybe there is a &quot;lock&quot; inside the meshed firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>janprunk</strong> on 17 Dec 2016, 18:57)</p>

					<p>That is a secondary PC (well it doesn&#039;t matter), but no it&#039;s being unreachable. I am pinging from the same home subnet. Suggested fix, that I am going to try is applying &quot;policy routing&quot; with the iptables rule &quot;iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j MARK --set-mark 0x31&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>janprunk</strong> on 17 Dec 2016, 22:01)</p>

					<p>This issue has been resolved. </p><p>The problem was actually totally &quot;something else&quot; and it happens, that I didn&#039;t check the issue before dealing with configuration. The thing was that my cable which was supposed to connect the router and the PC (Raspberry PI) didn&#039;t turn on the port LED light on the router, therefore the port connection was undetected and unsuccessful. At the same time I was falsely assured that the cable works, because when I replugged the PC into the other switch the PC was accessible and on-line. Maybe there is a problem with low voltage on any of these two devices, either the router or the Raspberry PI or a possible faulty Raspberry PI Ethernet port not being able to deliver sufficient power to the cable LED to light on the Wi-Fi router. I have tried with several other UTP cables and it still keeps failing occasionally, sometimes it will only become detectable when I reboot the Raspberry PI or the router.</p>									</div>
