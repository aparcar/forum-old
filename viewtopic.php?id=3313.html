					<p>I succesfully flashed the RC3 firmware using the original webinterface using<br />openwrt-wrt54gs_v4-squashfs.bin (14-Sep-2005 19:21&nbsp; 1.5M) <br />and followed the instructions in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/ClientModeHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/ClientModeHowto</a>, first bridged than routed client. I also tried other howto&#039;s like the one on martybugs.net and others. No success. I scanned the forum but did not find a solution. So I started again using the original instructions. </p><p>configuration steps I took:</p><p>removed firewal<br />installed wl using wired connection<br />erased nvram<br />lan_ipaddres = 192.168.6.1<br />wan_ipaddrs = 192.168.1.128 or 192.168.7.1<br />wan_proto=static, dhcp or none <br />wl0_mode=wet or sta</p><p>after commit and rebooting i can connect fine using (wired) lan and can use &#039; wl join ...&#039; to connect to wireless lan and see using iwconfig that the wireless interface is up on eth1.</p><p>I expect to be able to ping the router of the wireless lan, is this correct? In any case i can&#039;t ping it.</p><p>my questions:<br />Is my assumption wrong and am I missing something or is there something not ok in rc3 on the wrtgsv4? <br />Do I have to set a bridge to be able to ping the router? I tried the bridge using if_names for bridged client configuration but it failed.<br />I&#039;m prepared to do additional research but I need a hint.</p><p>Greetings<br />Nico de Groot</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t set both wifi_ifname and wan_ifname to the same interface or there&#039;ll be a conflict over the device.

					<p>thank you Joachim. You (in a way) forced me to study litlebit about iptables (<a href="http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/howto/iptables-HOWTO-1.html">http://www.linuxguruz.com/iptables/howt … WTO-1.html</a>)<br />But but.. it still puzzles me.. I mean I think I should be able to obtain IP addresses from DHCP (from towns server) accross the network evenif I didn&#039;t have the Firewall set.</p><p>Now what I&#039;ve done: <br />- bugged even more people wiht my petty problem - thanks everyone so far<br />- flashed nbd&#039;s pre-RC4</p><p>-set client mode (sta)</p><p>nvram set lan_ifnames=vlan0<br />nvram set lan_ifname=br0<br />nvram set wan_ifname=eth1<br />nvram set lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.1<br />nvram set lan_proto=static<br />nvram set wan_proto=dhcp<br />- set correct ssid<br />- set correct channel (as above)</p><p>And I am unhappy to inform you guys that the response is the same.. Still iwconfig (or wl status) gives the same and no addresses are distributed through WLAN/DHCP.. </p><p>BTW: If I was getting IP&#039;s from DHCP would they be written in nvram (no?).. How does it take them in use? How can I see if they are in use? (check route?, check ifconfig?) <br />As you can see I am completely lost here.</p>									</div>
