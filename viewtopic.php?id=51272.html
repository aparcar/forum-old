					<p>Hi</p><p>For a special project I would like to have router capable of support openwrt with at least 16mb Flash, 32mb ram and two radios (atheros based would be really cool)</p><p>I&#039;ve been checking in alibaba and I am in contact with some suppliers with routers running openwrt with similar specs, but reading this thread <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50466">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50466</a></p><p>it seems most of the chinese routers use the <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org.cn/">https://dev.openwrt.org.cn/</a>&nbsp; sources and it&#039;s difficult build your own firmware or even install new packages.</p><p>I&#039;ve been using the alix 3d3 and works really well for all my needs but the cost it&#039;s really high, I&#039;m facing a project where is required to provide internet with a captive portal, sniff people traffic based on mac and run some sync scripts based on php, so that&#039;s why I&#039;m looking for suppliers in china who can build a router with my requirements.</p><p>I&#039;d so glad if you can put me in touch or give me the contact info of a supplier able to help me.</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm. Standard routers like that, or expandable embedded devices like the Routerboard or Mikrotik equivalents are almost always going to be cheaper than getting your own custom-made stuff, even if you order 10,000 of them. Unless you get them from extreme cheapo chinese manufacturers, at which point you&#039;d be lucky to have them arrive in one piece let alone work properly...</p><p>Incidentally, low-end non-dual-radio routers like the TL-WR2543nd or the ever popular 1043nd are extremely cheap, and you can easily make them dual radio by attaching a USB wifi adapter. I find the Atheros ones perform best and you can get a dual-band, dual-stream one for £5 on ebay if you&#039;re lucky. Add that to £20-30 for a router (half that if you can stomach second hand) and it&#039;s half the price of any &quot;real&quot; dual-band routers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 26 Jun 2014, 13:59)</p>

					<p>Well last time I checked the WNDR3700 has long since moved on past the good old v1/v2 days. The v3 is Broadcomm based and not supported, while the v4 is basically a stripped down version of the WNDR4300. The good news is the WNDR4300/3700v4 have almost complete support (it&#039;s not quite official yet, but all the major components work) and would fit your bill of technical needs. Yes they are not $30 each, but having gone down the same sort of road in the past as others have pointed out if you plan on using these as a wide-scale long term component of your business you need to plan to pay at least $100/unit. </p><p>The more you cut costs on the upfront hardware, the more it will cost you in the long run. Try running putting OpenWRT on 5 TP-Links and running them against the same Openwrt on 5 Netgears or Asus routers. In our experience, the TP-links consistently fail long before the others, simply because the manufacturer cuts corners to make their equipment cheaper. If you&#039;re going to be a service provider, you need to look at the total cost of that. Sure you might save say 30-40% upfront on hardware, but if your failure risk/rate is increased by 50-70% is it worth the upfront saving? Since now, knowing the potential failure rate, you have to plan for &quot;replacement stock/inventory&quot; as well as costs of downtime and costs of implementing the replacement policies.</p><p>The other major challenge comes from long term viability. Sure some Chinese manufacturer might spec and supply you with the ideal unit... setup your custom build around it, deploy, get all kinds of assurances that they love you forever, etc... but when you use up your initial inventory you go back and ask for more and sure enough they will send you the &quot;better updated version&quot;. It will happen, and all of a sudden you&#039;re stuck with a deployed business model, customers lining up, and no working solution to deliver. This happens even with the mainstream/retail equipment as manufacturers change product line ups to keep with the times... but the key difference is the mainstream guys give you two things 1) old inventory is usually available for 3-6 months after the product is discontinued/replaced and 2) other open source people (i.e. the openWRT community) tend to care about supporting the new product as it&#039;s a common unit that has large appeal. Of course those two points do guarantee anything, but they certainly give you much better odds of being able to develop and transition hardware platforms before you have to start turning customers away.</p><p>Anyway your mileage and experiences may vary, but we&#039;ve been building and selling products based around OpenWRT devices for 8 years now and those are the lessons/conclusions that we&#039;ve drawn. At the end of the day, the best option is to simply find a good distributor who will give you a bulk/volume discount on the unit you want, and price your product accordingly.</p>									</div>

If you&#039;re buying a large number of routers for a specific purpose you would be making sure to buy the correct version anyway...</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The more you cut costs on the upfront hardware, the more it will cost you in the long run.

I&#039;ve run 5 TP-Links, and the same Openwrt on 5 Netgears and Linksys and D-Links. Not one has failed, despite them being run completely out of spec (e.g. outdoors using badly voltage-drooped passive PoE over a damaged/water ingressed ethernet cable in -10&#039;c temperatures and no humidity protection, or stacked on top of each other unventilated such that the chips reach over 80&#039;c). If you are getting lots of failures it&#039;s more likely you&#039;re doing something wrong.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>but the key difference is the mainstream guys give you two things 1) old inventory is usually available for 3-6 months after the product is discontinued/replaced and 2) other open source people (i.e. the openWRT community) tend to care about supporting the new product as it&#039;s a common unit that has large appeal.

There&#039;s pretty much 100% compatibility between any two devices of the same platform irrespective of manufacturer model or revision, so if they discontinued something you&#039;ll find fifty other manufacturers supplying a similar model that will behave exactly the same once booted up.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve found the wifi pineapple devices <a href="https://wifipineapple.com/">https://wifipineapple.com/</a></p><p>they list this specs:<br />CPU: 400 MHz MIPS Atheros AR9331 SoC.<br />Memory: 16 MB ROM, 64 MB DDR2 RAM<br />Disk: Micro SD support up to 32 GB, FAT or EXT, 2 GB Included<br />Mode Select: 5 DIP Switches - 2 System, 3 User configurable<br />Wireless: Atheros AR9331 IEEE 802.11 b/g/n + Realtek RTL8187 IEEE 802.11 b/g<br />Ports: (2) SMA Antenna, 10/100 Ethernet, USB 2.0, Micro SD, TTL Serial, Expansion Bus<br />Power: DC in Variable 5-12v, ~1A, 5.5mm*2.1mm connector, International Power Supply<br />Status Indicators: Power LED, Ethernet LED, Wireless 1 LED, Wireless 2 LED</p><p>And they are openwrt based, what do you think?<br />I&#039;ll try to get one of those, but do you think would be possible to run the AP using the Atheros interface and running airodump using the realtek?<br />both at the same time?</p>									</div>
