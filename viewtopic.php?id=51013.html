					<p>Hello. I&#039;d like to get a little more detail if possible on OpenWRT installation for DIR-645. I just completed install on my WNR2000 and Wiki Was very helpful with links to forum posts and stuff, basically no questions at all on how to do things. With this one I am kinda confused, from one side it&#039;s easy instructions ..... login to router ..download image ...flash ... but from other it&#039;s totally confusing. Like what image to download , I mean I see a lot of folders with different CPU brands yet my CPU &quot;Ralink&quot; is not there, it&#039;s totally possible it called something else in there but how do I know, or anyone really. So if possible can anyone to point me to right direction on what bin to use and stuff, and may be some instruction on what to do.</p><p>Than k you very much.</p>									</div>

Also I looked at other &quot;similar&quot; models from Dlink to see how it&#039;s done, and ..... I can&#039;t say I know what to do yes cause tutorials are really different from one to another. Please Respond.</p>									</div>

					<p>According to <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-645_rev_A1">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-645_rev_A1</a> DIR-645 using Ralink RT3662 CPU and that cpu designated as RAMIPS, now I see 3 different folders within and I don&#039;t understand what they mean, is it different builds or</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ramips/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … 09/ramips/</a></p><p>All 3 being created within 1 minute from each other so I presume they are all the same but I am sure designed for different purpose. Now inside I See same files and it looks like folder name represent CPU model may be, tr288x rt305x and rt3883 now my model CPU is rt3662 ...now what. all 3 does not match. I really don&#039;t want to mess this thing up but I think I am getting closer. I almost positive that I am in correct folder but what .bin to use I still not sure cause CPU model does not match mine.</p><p>UPDATE: it looks like CPU indeed RT3662 but according to Wiki routers SoC is Ralink 3883 (MIPS 74Kc) so 3883 folder is the one we need. Now all I need is to figure one what bin is to use. I see only 2 files with .bin extention openwrt-ramips-rt3883-uImage.bin&nbsp; and openwrt-ramips-rt3883-vmlinux.bin, I gut telling me it&#039;s uImage and not vmlinux. this vm thing sounds like VMware Virtual Machine image.</p><p>UPDATE:</p><p>openwrt-ramips-rt3883-uImage.bin image is not working. It&#039;s saying &quot;Invalid image file&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xakep</strong> on 9 Jun 2014, 02:46)</p>

					<p>Guys,</p><p>I need some help here.&nbsp; I flashed the firmware named:&nbsp; &quot;openwrt-ramips-rt3883-dir-645-squashfs-factory.bin&quot; from the URL:&nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips.rt3883/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … ps.rt3883/</a> like was mentioned by uchihakyo.</p><p>After flashing and rebooting the router, all I got was a power LED.&nbsp; The WIFI LED is off.&nbsp; I waited a few minutes to see if anything changed.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Thinking I bricked my router, I tried to do a factory reset like mentioned in the debricking process.&nbsp; I now get a blinking Internet LED and my desktop does in fact have Internet access.</p><p>However, I cannot access the router&#039;s firmware.&nbsp; I am presumably running on OpenWRT, but my router isn&#039;t broadcasting wirelessly but its Ethernet ports work.&nbsp; There is no Gateway IP address listed for my router, but there are three DNS IP address (my ISP&#039;s DNS IP).&nbsp; In other words, my router is acting as a pass-thru.&nbsp; I tried going to 24.217.128.1 to see if I can access my router&#039;s firmware but I get nothing.&nbsp; Any ideas on how I can complete the upgrade process?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DarthBobo</strong> on 25 Sep 2014, 03:37)</p>
