					<p>Hi,<br />Installed self compiled 10.3 backfire on usb stick. Everytime it boots e2fsck tells the file system is with error. Even running e2fsck and cleaning it and rechecking the filesystem. Everything seems ok but when rebooted the file system again shows error. Anyone can tell how to clean or make ext2 stable</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I see both in this thread as well as another <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27440">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27440</a> reports that an OpenWRT ext2 filesystem is subject to corruption.</p><p>What else besides a sudden loss of power to the device might cause an OpenWRT rootfs on an ext2 filesystem to corrupt so that it cannot boot?</p><p>Related question:<br />Can I expect the ext4 filesystem within the images currently in /snapshots/trunk/x86/ to be more reliable?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>valuequest</strong> on 5 Sep 2011, 16:36)</p>
