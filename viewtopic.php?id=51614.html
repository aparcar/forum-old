					<p>Hello, I&#039;m testing the cerowrt&#039;s sqm scripts in Barrier Breaker r41547 and I&#039;m experiencing 100% of CPU usage when being at full bandwidth usage. The process which consumes all the CPU is ksoftirqd.</p><p>Because of that, I&#039;m not able to reach the full capacity configured, it stalls at about 7 MB/s. Stopping the sqm scripts, and leaving fq_codel as the only qdisc in the outgoing interface, enables me to reach my full line capacity of 12 MB/s</p><p>Is there anything I can do to avoid this CPU bottleneck? My router is a Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H.</p>									</div>

					<p>the WZR-HP-AG300H has essentially the same hardware (SoC, wireless, switch, etc.) as the WNDR3800 that CeroWrt targets, so maybe it&#039;s an issue with standard OpenWrt using the SQM scripts?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 15 Jul 2014, 06:04)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m having the same problem with the same router...<br/>I&#039;ve installed the last version of barrier braker in OpenWRT site, but in my case I cant detect who is the responsable.<br/>I already updated everything, hostapd included (that I see in another comment in this forum).<br/>The annoyuing part is when I do a reboot, everything goes to normal for a while (a few hours) then, something ramps near to 100% (I can see the load at htop for exemplo, but none of the services running that I can see where with a high load, or even the sum of these)</p>									</div>

					<p>You could try posting on the cerowrt-devel mailing list:<br/><a href="https://lists.bufferbloat.net/listinfo/cerowrt-devel">https://lists.bufferbloat.net/listinfo/cerowrt-devel</a><br/>to get their take on it.</p><p>I&#039;m running CC so I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the same as under BB, but you could try disabling SQM and instead enabling the standard OpenWRT QoS - at least in CC QoS uses the underlying fq_codel.</p><p>Please report back here your results both in any feedback from cerowrt and also any difference you find (or not) with QoS.</p>									</div>
