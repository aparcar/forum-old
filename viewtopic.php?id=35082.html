					<p>Enter the launch page: a flash-based, interactive display of the Dash&#039;s potential utility. The page allows users to travel to four locations: The Bedroom, The Kitchen, The Family Room, and World of Dash (i.e., the world), with each portal offering a compelling flash animation of different ways that the Dash can be used. Below the animation, Sony explains the Dash more precisely through static pictures and images.</p><p>Chrome Web Store</p><p>Search engine giant Google is known for its simplistic website design â€” just compare their homepage to those of competitors Yahoo! or Bing. So for the search engine&#039;s new Chrome Web Store, a showcase of the applications, extensions, and themes for Google&#039;s Chrome browser, the company maintained its minimalistic aesthetic.</p><p>The Chrome Store website design features a simple white background and primarily blue color scheme, with blue links and menu headers. It also includes a rotating banner, top center, showcasing some of the most popular downloads. The menus are well organized to display choice categories like the most popular paid downloads and the staff favorites, as well as filters to list the downloads by purpose and season.</p><p>Whether you&#039;re interested in creating a fancy flash website or a minimalistic website design based in HTML, the aforementioned small business websites should help you get started with your own design ideas. Remember that website design is relevant in a variety of forms, from Facebook welcome tabs to WordPress website design for blogging. Good luck!</p><p><a href="http://www.websiteincms.com/wordpress-websites.php">wordpress website designer</a><br /><a href="http://www.websiteincms.com/wordpress-websites.php">wordpress website design</a><br /><a href="http://www.websiteincms.com/wordpress-websites.php">web design company</a></p>									</div>
