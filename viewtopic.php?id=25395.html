					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I installed the 2.4 based open wrt like described here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54gl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54gl</a></p><p>i the set the nvram commands</p><p>I then wanted to do an update to 2.6 but i was not able to flash it by the webinterface (it tells me &quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot;). Flashing back to the oiginal FW gie me the same message.</p><p>I tried using a windows tftp software from here (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/), but it does not start downloading.</p><p>What else can i do to install the latest firmware?</p><p>Also i would liket to know: i heard there is a way to install something like a ticket system for giving users access to the WLAN (like in a hotel where we want to control users using the wlan). Is something like this possible? Any hints on this?</p><p>I am new to this, so please point me into the right direction if you can, thanks.-))</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>allow2010</strong> on 23 Jun 2010, 21:10)</p>

					<p>With OpenWrt firmware, you can flash via telnet with the &quot;mtd&quot; command or via the web interface.&nbsp; Both methods use the TRX file.</p><p>The BIN file is just the TRX file with a modified header to make it look like the factory firmware (to make it happy and accept the image).</p><p>To go back to the factory firmware, I think you have to use the TFTP method, which will accept the BIN format (original firmware).&nbsp; This can sometimes be tricky... search the forums for tips on flashing via TFTP.&nbsp; But why would you want to go back to the factory firmware?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 23 Jun 2010, 23:41)</p>
