					<p>I&#039;m trying to get OpenWrt working on my R8000 and I cannot see to be able to get the 5GHz radios enabled. There are two of them radio0 and radio2, and neither activates when I enable them via LuCi:</p><p><a href="https://goo.gl/photos/1vmkVihsnrMAW213A">https://goo.gl/photos/1vmkVihsnrMAW213A</a></p><p>The interfaces seem to be configured and bridged accordingly.</p><p><a href="https://goo.gl/photos/xFRxqdS9gS5FNCCV7">https://goo.gl/photos/xFRxqdS9gS5FNCCV7</a></p><p>Where else should I be looking for the problem?</p><p>The 5GHz radios seem to be working for scans (I can see other 5GHz band networks in the neighbourhood), but they my configured SSIDs are not showing up, and LuCi reports they are disabled as per the first screenshot above.</p><p>I notice this in dmesg:</p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp;15.351600] brcmfmac 0000:01:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt failed with error -2<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;15.374720] firmware brcm!brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt: firmware_loading_store: map pages failed<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;15.869864] brcmfmac 0001:03:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt failed with error -2<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;15.893020] firmware brcm!brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt: firmware_loading_store: map pages failed<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;16.399870] brcmfmac 0001:04:00.0: Direct firmware load for brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt failed with error -2<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;16.423010] firmware brcm!brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt: firmware_loading_store: map pages failed</p><p>I thought R8000 was supposed to be supported by 15.05.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gordan</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 23:00)</p>

					<p>I just reflashed the image, purging all the settings, and the first time it does seem to come up with the 5GHz APs enabling and showing up as working. But as soon as I make any change to the APs, even if just changing the SSID, they go down and never come back.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gordan</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 23:32)</p>

					<p>After a bit of testing, I have a reproducible bug. The 5GHz radios seem to work fine right up to the point where the region is changed from 00 (World) to anything else. Even without changing it, setting the 5GHz channel above 48 results in the radio not coming up.</p><p>Once the region is changed, the radios will not work again until a full settings purge, even if it is reset back to region 00.</p><p>This looks very much like a bug.</p><p>Edit: It seems a reboot is sufficient as long as the settings are acceptable to the radio and region is 00. Setting the channel width to 160MHz also causes it to break.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gordan</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 23:41)</p>

					<p>Yup.&nbsp; That, too.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lengthy discussion including several issues and remedies in the main thread for R8000.&nbsp; The problem is that it&#039;s sooooo long.&nbsp; Like &gt; 20 pages.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems forcing WPA2-PSK to AES also causes the 5GHz radio to die, even though auto defaults to AES and auto works.</p><p>Thanks for the link.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gordan</strong> on 19 Jul 2016, 23:46)</p>
