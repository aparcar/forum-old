					<p>Hello,<br />I am trying to implement a localization method based on WLAN round trip time (RTT) ranging. Some of the papers I have read suggest doing ranging based on the MAC layer RTTs (beacons, ACK, RTS/CTS etc.) However, the MAC layer time resolution is only 1µs. Relatively accurate ranging can still be can still be performed by taking upwards of a 1000 measurements and doing some statistical analysis on the resulting Gaussian distribution. </p><p>However, some papers mention using the internal clock of the WLAN module as time basis for ranging. These clocks typically have a time resolution of only a few ns, which would greatly increase accuracy. </p><p>My question is:<br />How can I access these internal clocks in the WLAN modules? All the round trip time measurement tools I have come across so far (libpcap, wireshark) only give MAC layer based information with the 1µs resolution. <br />Can anyone point me in a direction towards resources, code or anything that will help me capture the send/receive time of a beacon message, ACK, or RTS/CTS with regards to the internal clock? Has anyone here successfully accessed and read that clock and would be wiling to give me some pointers?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>PS: If anyone is interested, just let me know and I will link the papers (if that is allowed)</p>									</div>
