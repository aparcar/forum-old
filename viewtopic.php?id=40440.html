					<p>Last nite I flashed my dsl router with a firmware off of d-links website <a href="http://tsd.dlink.com.tw/downloads2008detailgo.asp">http://tsd.dlink.com.tw/downloads2008detailgo.asp</a> I used the DSL-2540U T1 FW IM_1.00 firmware. I flashed the router through its web interface. it restarted and all that happens now is that the dsl stays grey and if I plug an Ethernet cable into any of the ports they light up. Previously the power and status lights would come on.</p><p>Can anyone with the know how to fix this router please let me know as I cannot figure out what to do from here?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you flashed over wireless probably you bricked the router.<br />You can see in manual if there is a recovery solution.</p><p>But remember, never flash over wireless always over Ethernet.</p>									</div>

					<p>DSL-2540U does not have wireless..</p><p>It comes in several different versions and simply wrong firmware can very well brick it..</p><p>When you choose the official firmware, first you should check the sticker underneath the device, &quot;H/W Ver.&quot;&nbsp; It may be C1, C2, T1 etc..<br />Choose the firmware that fits accordingly..</p>									</div>
