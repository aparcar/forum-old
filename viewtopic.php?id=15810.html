					<p>Hello all.</p><p>newbe in openwrt, but i managed to compile and understand ar7 platform. I&#039;ve follow carefully ALL the guides and instructions to upgrade firmware, searching hqs in firmware bin, modifying mtd, mtd1, using ftp to upgrade, even using tichksum to add checksum to bin file. Nothing works after upload openwrt firmware the router don&#039;t start properly. I also tried x-wrt snapshots with the same results. The original firmware and routertech firmware works like a charm.</p><p>Can anybody help?, i really interested in openwrt.</p><p>Best regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again.</p><p>does none found this issues before?, I forgot to mention that a few weeks before I tried with a x-wrt compilation and the 524T booted properly, but unfortunately I&#039;ve lost the bin and a don&#039;t remember which version was. After that no success.</p><p>btw, the routertech firmware has header and checksum and it can be flashed with the same mtd partitions as the original firmware tougth the hqs string doesn&#039;t fit these partitions. After flashing the partitions change to the proper values automatically (no matter if you flash with ftp server or Ti tool), why it doesn&#039;t happen with openwrt?</p><p>I&#039;m completly lost, help please.</p>									</div>

					<p>What version are you using?</p><p>There is currently, and has been for some time,&nbsp; a bug in the current &quot;bleeding edge&quot; that prevents the ethernet interface on the 524t from working!!!<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3124">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3124</a></p><p>If you plan to use the dsl-524t as a modem/router with OpenWrt I suggest that you compile and use the r9234 version, it&#039;s still the most stable and complete version of openwrt for the dsl-524t. I&#039;m running different versions of OpenWrt on dsl-524t and it&#039;s dsl-g624t and as long as I get the partion-values right I have had no problem installing OpenWrt using ftp (exept for the current ethernet bug that is).</p><p>I really recommend that you get&nbsp; a serial interface so you can use the console on the 524 though, that will show you any and all installation or boot problems right away.</p>									</div>
