					<p>hi Guys, the most likely platform I could found is tl-wr841n-v9, which is for QCA9533, but I&#039;m told that QCA9533&#039;s wifi is same with that of QCA9531,<br />so i get the latest version from svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk, revision: 45188,<br />but when i updated the built out bin file onto QCA9531 board, the wifi and USB is not working,&nbsp; I could see the WiFi is not up successfully.<br />do I need to patch something onto current trunk? or should I need to make any modification in the configuration? could anybody help me how to do?<br />I am really appreciated for you guys&#039; help.</p>									</div>
