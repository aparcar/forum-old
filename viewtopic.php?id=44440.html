					<p>I have been hunting for a simple script, or something to log the&nbsp; &quot;load&quot; the router deals with daily, at any given time. IE. 15-30min intervals.</p><p>All I&#039;m after tracking is how many wireless clients the radio is serving at each sample and possibly the CPU load. The latter not being a requirement.</p><p>That&#039;s it, straight and simple.<br />No MACs, no traffic logging, IPs, TCP dumps... NUTTIN... NADA! <br />Just wanting to track how busy my hotspot is. </p><p>Does anything like this exist?<br />HW: WRT54GL <br />CPU: Broadcom - Core ver. 9<br />OpenWRT ver: 10.03.1<br />Platform: Legacy brcm-2.4</p><p>Thanks everyone!! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for that helpful information Nilfred.</p><p>However, please forgive me, I&#039;m not a newb to Linux/OpenWRT, but not well versed in making scripts from scratch or close to it.<br />I can usually hack it if I know what things do &amp; have an example to go off of.</p><p>If you could clarify and, or affirm my interpretations of the following, that&#039;d be swell! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I presume the 1st part of the 1st line: <em>&quot;0,15,30,45 * * * * &quot;</em><br />If I&#039;m reading the man pg. correctly for cron, this 1st set of numerals separated by commas would be the minutes. Then the 4 remaining entries, the asterisk symbols indicate that it is to occur at any: hour, day of month, month &amp; weekday. Did I follow correctly?<br />I also assume the zero means to run at minute zero, IE. the turn of every hour. Thereby these settings would have the cron job run every 15min, all day, every day. Yes?</p><br /><p>On the rest of that line: <em>&quot;/usr/bin/logger -p&quot;</em><br />I see we&#039;re running the &#039;logger&#039; daemon and passing it the &quot;-p&quot; command, which is? <br /><em>-p&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cron permit any crontab, which user set.</em><br />y/n? </p><p>Of the next part in the command: <em>&quot;cron.info -t network&quot;</em><br />Where does this file &quot;cron.info&quot; get created, or is it already present?<br />I find no reference to &quot;cron.info&quot; on Google either.<br />I can&#039;t find &quot;-t&quot; in the man pg. so I&#039;m unsure with it.</p><br /><p>On the next command: <em>&quot;Network&quot;</em><br />I presume that is passing a category, telling it to use a network interface as follows in the rest of the script, or specific network logging subset?</p><br /><p><em>&quot;&quot;WiFi clients: $(Breakcom sucks specific command to count)&quot;&quot;</em><br />I presume &quot;WiFi clients&quot; is simply a name, could be any name, that has been chosen for identification of the value that supersedes it, correct?</p><p>This is the part I&#039;m quite unsure of.<br />What is that last part? I Googled high &amp; low for &quot;Breakcom&quot; so I could figure it out from there, as to what to fill in for a proper command. But I could find nothing at all. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s simply *nix term I&#039;m not connecting the dots on.</p><p>If there&#039;s some command that&#039;ll do the counting of certain variables inside data I pipe to it. I could use this command possibly.<br /><em>wl -i wl0.1 assoclist</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>This just lists the mac address and the station name as I recall. There are no clients connected atm so I can&#039;t check.
XXX.XXX.XX.XX    station_name</code></pre></div><p>This would be another option:<br /><em>arp -i</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>IP address       HW type     Flags       HW address            Mask     Device
192.168.1.97     0x1         0x2         00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX     *        br-lan
XXX.XXX.XX.XX    0x1         0x2         00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX     *        br-wan</code></pre></div><p>Then have it just count the number of MACs and tada!</p><p>The rest of it makes perfect sense, the proc part. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
