					<p>Better off asking in the DD-WRT forums. I&#039;ve had issues getting back to stock from DD-WRT before as well. There&#039;s usually a revert file or you may have to use TFTP or serial recovery.</p>									</div>

					<p>HW v1.x and v2.x are completely different underlying hardware (different SoC, CPU, etc.) - please don&#039;t apply any firmware intended for one to the other.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 5 Mar 2015, 04:03)</p>
