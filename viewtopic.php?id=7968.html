					<p>I&#039;m interested in running openwrt on asterisk but I preffer to use the original firmware.<br />I&#039;ve tried to install asterisk but I have some configuration difficulties, for now what I need is just to let 2 ip phones/softphones talking beetween them on the wrt wireless network. I have been able to make two softphones (x-lite) registering on asterisk on my wrt box but if I try to make a call beetween then it doesn&#039;t&#039; work. <br />For now I&#039;m just interested in having phones talking beetween them locally because I haven&#039;t an account with a sip provider. <br />However your idea is interesting.</p>									</div>

					<p>you can use my firmware. This is original openwrt rc5 but it is configured with a stable asterisk 1.2.10.</p><p>It has 3 sip account:</p><p>1234 1235 1236</p><p>I think that this configuration is good for your necessity.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>socrat3</strong> on 3 Nov 2006, 21:06)</p>

					<p>Sorry for answering just now but I don&#039;t trust flashing a non official openwrt release and I can&#039;t take the risk of briking another router. <br />However being interested in your setup I dowloaded your firmware and tried to extract it with these tools : </p><p><a href="http://www.bitsum.com/firmware_mod_kit.htm">http://www.bitsum.com/firmware_mod_kit.htm</a></p><p>Then I tried to run the excract firmware script on your trx file but it says me that your image in unsupported .. <br />How did you get that image ? You didnt&#039; rebuild openwrt right ? (you should get a bin image for wrt54gl and not a trx image if you use imagebuilder to rebuild your customized firmware) .&nbsp; </p><p>I would apprieciate just to have a look at your asterisk conf files. </p><p>Thanks.<br />KiaZ</p>									</div>
