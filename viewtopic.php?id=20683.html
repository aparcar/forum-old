					<p>Can&#039;t find any reference to this driver supporting the tnetw1350a, though there are posts on the driver mailing list asking if it could be supported. There hasn&#039;t been a commit to the driver source for a year so I think the chances of it getting supported in the near future are slim. I&#039;m currently downloading all the AR7 based firmware source codes I can find looking for a linux 2.6 binary driver module, but so far all the firmwares I&#039;ve found are based on 2.4 (like routertech is, which I assume is how they are able to support it).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Simon,</p><p>Thanks for the detailed reply!</p><p>It took me a while to &quot;organise&quot; a serial console as my laptop is modern and therefore lacking serial or parallel ports.
