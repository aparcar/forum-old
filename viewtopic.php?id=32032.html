					<p>I managed to get a backfire build on my router but couldn&#039;t get the wireless interface to work so I decided to go back to a 2.4 build.

					<p>You know I was going to point out that I have a Linksys, not an ASUS but I tried it anyways and got the power light to flash and it&#039;s constantly responding to pings.&nbsp; I swear I&#039;ve tried this multiple times and was unable to get it to blink.&nbsp; I found many people that mentioned holding reset while connecting power, but had no luck.</p><p>Tried tftp a few times and always getting <br />Timeout occurred.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Connect request failed.</p><p>At least now I know I have a chance at saving it.&nbsp; Time for some more research. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so figured it out.<br />Using the above link I was able to get to Failsafe mode (blinking power and responding to pings).<br />I couldn&#039;t scp, tftp, or ssh to the router, but telnet worked.</p><p>From there I followed the info in this link:<br /><a href="http://cyberforat.squat.net/openwrt/OpenWrt-HOWTO/x338.html">http://cyberforat.squat.net/openwrt/Ope … /x338.html</a><br />The mount command didn&#039;t show any mtd mounts so I ran &#039;firstboot&#039; as it said and rebooted.&nbsp; </p><p>Router now has it&#039;s web interface up, responds to ssh etc... </p><p>Now to figure out the wireless interface...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pqee</strong> on 21 Sep 2011, 12:52)</p>
