					<p>Yesterday I saw in the changelist something mentioned about supporting the HG655b officially in trunk now.

					<p>Ok great to know, Thanks for the amazing work so far! I will generate my own images tomorrow and see if they work. </p><p>Another thing. Last time I mentioned that I was going to solder/plug a external SMA to this unit. And since I had to open the case to flash it with JTaG I took some time to follow all the traces with my multimeter. And it seems that those squares of each side of the board are the internal PCB antennas. So removing the present Coax-cable and solder that one to a external SMA shouldn&#039;t be such of a problem. But the other one is connected directly to the PCB antenna trace(square) so I need to find out where to interrupt the signal so I can solder a Coax cable to it.</p><p>There are also some Pigtail connectors which show some similarities with a U.FL connection but then reversed. It could also be a MMCX connector but I never had one of those in my own hands only saw them op pictures. But after all I guess these connectors are only there for calibration purposes. And need some resistors removed to be actually usable. Otherwise the power of the Wireless chipset is simply shared (to the antenna with the least amount of resistance) between the Internal and External SMA antenna.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>So if anyone has tips. please feel free to share.</p><p>Oh... and I also added a small 1cmx1cm heatsink to the wireless chipset. I&#039;ve seen multiple posts about failing chipsets due heat. So I hope it doesn&#039;t happen to this unit anymore <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, Gigi<br />You could try again. I just tried my own compiled image from trunk/smp.<br />The steps are:<br />- plug out the device<br />- make sure the power button is off<br />- plug in the device<br />- press tre reset hole with an unfolded paperclip or pin and keep it pressed<br />- power on the device from the power button<br />- wait until (in my case) the power led goes off<br />- set your computer to static IP 192.168.1.5 and netmask 255.255.255.0 (or /24)<br />- connect a lan cable to the LAN1 plug of the device. For direct connection to your computer you could need a cross-over cable, although it may work also with direct cable (the device may detect the correct wiring, I didn&#039;t test). If you connect through a switch there is no problem.<br />- open your browser and connect to 192.168.1.1. you should see the web interface of the device&#039;s CFE. Choos your file (squashfs type). press upgrade<br />- you have to wait quite a time, 2 to 5 minutes. in my case it took I think around 3 minutes. you can check if you keep pinging 192.168.1.1.<br />after that connect again to 192.168.1.1 and luci should work.<br />you can try my image here<br /><a href="https://app.box.com/s/aojif6op2gyxjcw8ln0q6ssx8mcjrum5">https://app.box.com/s/aojif6op2gyxjcw8ln0q6ssx8mcjrum5</a> (openwrt-brcm63xx-smp-HG655b-squashfs-cfe.bin)<br />in this folder<br /><a href="https://app.box.com/s/zfof02e4l1iq10n2aiwoq13u3m5535rk">https://app.box.com/s/zfof02e4l1iq10n2aiwoq13u3m5535rk</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fratzicu</strong> on 30 May 2015, 21:49)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t know were to post, I hope this is the right spot...<br />Greetings from Athens.<br />I am working on a Netgear DG834gt for 1 year almost. I have modded a usb, changed the ram from 16MB to 32, and the flash chip from 4MB to 8. I downloaded the compiling tool also for the cfe(very nice indeed)!<br />My problem now is that with the 8MB flash the board cannot POST. CFE enters in a restarting loop. The same cfe on a 4MB router works very nice!!!<br />I have attached serial logs for help. I have also attached JTAG logs as well. Netgear&#039;s initial cfe(1.0.37-5.11) cannot recognize the 8MB flash id and enters in a restart loop as well.<br />Could you please give some help? I have studied the last 2 days many .c files from the cfe builder code but I did not find any solution. <br />Thanks in advance.</p><p>=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= PuTTY log 2015.05.25 11:35:03 =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=</p><br /><p>CFE version 1.0.37-6.4 for BCM96348 (32bit,SP,BE)<br />Build Date: Sun May 24 02:45:22 EEST 2015 (root@drchris)<br />Copyright (C) 2000-2005 Broadcom Corporation.</p><p>Boot Address 0xbfc00000</p><p>Initializing Arena.<br />Initializing Devices.<br />Parallel flash device: name MX29LV640BT, id 0x22c9, size 8192KB<br />**Exception 8: EPC=00000000, Cause=00000000 (Interrupt)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RA=54333956, VAddr=32394C56</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; ($00) = 00000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AT ($01) = 00000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; v0 ($02) = 00000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;v1 ($03) = 32394C56<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a0 ($04) = 80524A20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a1 ($05) = 00000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a2 ($06) = 0000FFFF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a3 ($07) = 8041A2F8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t0 ($08) = 0000FFFF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t1 ($09) = 8041A2F8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t2 ($10) = 00000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t3 ($11) = 32394C56<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t4 ($12) = 42000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t5 ($13) = 6C6C656C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t6 ($14) = 73682064&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t7 ($15) = 653A206E<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s0 ($16) = 4D583239&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;s1 ($17) = 3042542C<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s2 ($18) = 30783232&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;s3 ($19) = 73697A65<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s4 ($20) = 324B420A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;s5 ($21) = 00000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s6 ($22) = 00000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;s7 ($23) = 32394C56<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t8 ($24) = 54000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t9 ($25) = 00000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; k0 ($26) = 00000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;k1 ($27) = 32394C56<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gp ($28) = 54000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sp ($29) = 00000000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fp ($30) = 00000000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ra ($31) = 54333956</p><br /><p>=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= PuTTY log 2015.05.27 05:55:21 =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=</p><br /><p>CFE version 1.0.37-6.4 for BCM96348 (32bit,SP,BE)<br />Build Date: Tue May 26 23:42:09 EEST 2015 (drchris@drchris)<br />Copyright (C) 2000-2005 Broadcom Corporation.</p><p>Boot Address 0xbfc00000</p><p>Initializing Arena.<br />Initializing Devices.<br />Parallel flash device: name MX29LV320AB, id 0x22a8, size 4096KB</p><p>** Image information not found. **</p><p>CPU type 0x29107: 256MHz, Bus: 128MHz, Ref: 32MHz<br />Total memory: 33554432 bytes (32MB)</p><p>Total memory used by CFE:&nbsp; 0x80401000 - 0x80524E30 (1195568)<br />Initialized Data:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x8041C660 - 0x8041E550 (7920)<br />BSS Area:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x8041E550 - 0x80422E30 (18656)<br />Local Heap:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x80422E30 - 0x80522E30 (1048576)<br />Stack Area:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x80522E30 - 0x80524E30 (8192)<br />Text (code) segment:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x80401000 - 0x8041C658 (112216)<br />Boot area (physical):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x00525000 - 0x00565000<br />Relocation Factor:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I:00000000 - D:00000000</p><p>Board IP address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 192.168.1.1&nbsp; <br />Host IP address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 192.168.1.100&nbsp; <br />Gateway IP address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Run from flash/host (f/h)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: f&nbsp; <br />Default host run file name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : vmlinux&nbsp; <br />Default host flash file name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : bcm963xx_fs_kernel&nbsp; <br />Boot delay (0-9 seconds)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 1&nbsp; <br />Board Id Name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 96348GW-10&nbsp; <br />Psi size in KB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 24<br />Number of MAC Addresses (1-32)&nbsp; &nbsp; : 2&nbsp; <br />Base MAC Address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 00:18:4d:64:9c:8e&nbsp; <br />Ethernet PHY Type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: Internal<br />Memory size in MB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 32<br />CMT Thread Number&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 0</p><p>CFE&gt; <br />web info: Waiting for connection on socket 0.[J</p><p>CFE&gt; </p><br /><p>============================================<br />Telsey MAGIC EJTAG Debrick Utility v0.9beta2<br />============================================</p><p>Probing bus ...
