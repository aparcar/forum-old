					<p>Hi Everyone;<br />I just picked up a WNDR3800 and I am running a trunk build on it. I&#039;ve run iperf tests to get a sense of the limit of the speed of the wireless and i noticed something I found strange. When getting data from the router I will get 70-100MBit/s which is much less than the connection speed but I can understand there being many reasons for that. However sending data only happens at about 30-35Mbit/s. </p><p>Why is there such a difference here based on direction.</p><p>Test was done with a laptop running arch linux with a Intel Advanced-N 6205 wireless card if that is relevant.</p>									</div>

					<p>In ideal conditions the limit is almost always in the CPU.</p><p>Sending data at the access point side requires less CPU cycles -&gt; data you receive at your laptop with higher speed.<br />Receiving data at the access point side requires more CPU effort. &lt;- data you send from your laptop</p><p>You may reach the CPU limit at the router when you send data from your laptop.</p><p>Why sending data requires less CPU? well I have no answer...</p>									</div>

					<p>I had thought maybe it was something like that but figured (as I think you did) that decoding the data from the incoming stream would be less intensive than encoding it outgoing.</p>									</div>
