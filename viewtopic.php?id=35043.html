					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I would like to set up very strict firewall rules, so that only explicitely allowed traffic might pass as depicted in this image:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2ppzxic.jpg" alt="http://i43.tinypic.com/2ppzxic.jpg" /></span></p><p>With this set of rules, clients on the LAN can access HTTP, HTTPS, etc. on the Internet and they are also allowed to query DNS servers on the Internet.</p><p>My problem is, that the firewall itself (my router) cannot query DNS servers on the internet. I could resolve this by changing the &quot;Output&quot;-policy of the WAN to &quot;access&quot;. But this would also allow other &quot;Output&quot; traffic from WAN to the Internet.</p><p>Does anyone know how to create a rule to explicitely overwrite the &quot;Output&quot;-policy just for DNS queries so that the router could access DNS servers on the Internet (but nothing else)?</p><p>I have already tried several additional rules, but I cannot find a way to allow it without changing the &quot;Output&quot;-policy to &quot;access&quot;.</p><p>Any idea is being appreciated.</p><p>Regards,<br />Alex</p>									</div>
