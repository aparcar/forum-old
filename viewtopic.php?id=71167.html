Thanks to its open, license-free SDK, backed by a multitude of use-case examples and the easy way to flash customized logic, through the micro-USB, the platform can host versatile paradigms of IoT applications such as: </p><p>· Fencing of physical spaces (e.g. public exhibitions, building spaces). </p><p>· Guidance and crowd sourcing </p><p>· Home automation systems (surveillance, control, monitoring) </p><p>· Alarm systems </p><p>· Smart city networks and service solutions </p><p>· Sensor networks with OTA updates </p><p>The platform comes ready for use, preprogrammed with the basic ESP8266 SW. The HW operates on battery re-chargeable on micro-USB, but may be also operated without battery connected on micro-USB.</p>									</div>
