					<p>Hello, </p><br /><p>I installed RC3 on a v1.0 WRT54G.<br />I can telnet into it, and have wifi working,<br />but i can&#039;t get the wan to work.</p><p>I use a cable modem, so the docs says the wan interface should be vlan1<br />so i&#039;ve set: <br />wan_ifname = vlan1<br />wan_proto = dhcp<br />but when i do an&nbsp; ifup wan it can&#039;t seem to find a DHCP server.</p><p>Futhermore, the WAN port led is always off. I don&#039;t remember how it <br />worked with the linksys firmware, but my understanding is that it should <br />be on if the network cable is plugged in and the modem is on, whatever the tcp&nbsp; <br />configuration is. I tried plugging the cable in the other WRT switch ports, and they <br />didn&#039;t lit up either.&nbsp; If i plug a computer into those ports, they do lit up.<br />On the modem side, I have a led which will lit if a cable is plugged and the interface <br />on the other side is on, and this led is on. </p><p>The modem itself is still working correctly since i&#039;ve just connected my laptop to it <br />to write this message. </p><p>And i tried to turn the modem off for 5 minuts and replug it again in the WRT, with no luck.<br />(The modem &quot;records&quot; the MAC address which last asked for the DHCP lease, and won&#039;t <br />give a lease to another mac unless you reset it by plugging it off 5 minuts. So i thought that <br />maybe openwrt changed the MAC of the wan port, but no luck either..)</p><br /><p>Am i missing something ? And shouldn&#039;t this port led be on whenever the cable is plugged <br />and the modem on ??</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok so after changing the ethernet cable between the WRT and the modem, <br />AND rebooting the WRT the led finally came up !<br />The wan interface now discovers its address via DHCP, everything is ok. </p><p>I have no idea why this cable worked with the linksys firmware, and not <br />the openwrt one. It&#039;s not a crossover cable. Anyway i just trashed this evil thing.</p>									</div>
