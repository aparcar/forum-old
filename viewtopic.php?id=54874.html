					<p>Regarding original bricking, did you read the device-specific advice about your device: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500#return_to_factory_firmware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … y_firmware</a><br />You might have needed to cut away the bootloader part from the image before flashing.</p><p>Also the TFTP recovery process seems to depend on the exact firmware with which the router came originally (or on the bootloader that has been updated in a later OEM firmware upgrade).

					<p>Hi,</p><p>first of all, don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s very unlikely that you actually bricked your router. Even if you flash a non-functional or damaged image, you still have at least two options for recovery (usually serial access and JTAG). With all the required tools available it&#039;s usually easy to bring a router back to life after a failed firmware upgrade.</p><p>It&#039;s very likely that the bootloader is still operational but it cannot load the stock kernel image you flashed for some reason (for example, the image you flashed contains some header which needs to be removed before writing to flash).</p><p>Also, you might be using the wrong IP subnet, check this out:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500#tftp_recovery">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … p_recovery</a></p><p>The interesting part is: &quot;Firmware 3.14.1 updates the bootloader to use an IP address of 192.168.0.66 and look for a file named ArcherC7v3_tp_recovery.bin even on hardware v2 units&quot;</p><p>Have you tried using both 192.168.1.x and 192.168.0.x subnets?</p><p>For the TFTP server, depending on the actual implementation, you might need to enable the service within xinetd to run it and copy the image to the directory /tftpboot so that the router can fetch it. In some cases, global read access might be necessary in order to successfully serve the image to the client (simply set 777 rights on the directory and the file itself to ensure access).</p><p>On CentOS, tftpd&#039;s configuration is in file /etc/xinetd.d/tftp but it should be similar for other distros, too.</p><p>To enable the service, you need to change the line &quot;disable = yes&quot; to &quot;disable = no&quot;, otherwise xinetd will not start the daemon and your router won&#039;t be able to fetch the image.</p><p>As usual, make sure to start or restart the xinetd service once you have tftpd enabled.</p><p>Finally, if you have a firewall on your PC, ensure that it enables access to UDP port 69 from the local subnet.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geryhun</strong> on 2 Jan 2015, 12:41)</p>

					<p>First of all thank you both for your responses, they helped a lot.</p><p>I &quot;unbricked&quot; my unit succesfully with the TFTP recovery method, so I can confirm it works on Archer C5 v1.20</p><p>Not sure which file is the correct (in naming terms) I copied the same file (Archer C5 Bin) covering multiple combinations and put them into the tftp server directory:</p><p>sh4@notezator:/tftpboot$ ls<br />ArcherC5v120_tp_recovery.bin&nbsp; ArcherC5v3_tp_recovery.bin<br />ArcherC5v12_tp_recovery.bin&nbsp; &nbsp;ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin<br />ArcherC5v1_tp_recovery.bin&nbsp; &nbsp; ArcherC7v3_tp_recovery.bin<br />ArcherC5v2_tp_recovery.bin</p><p>The IP I used was: 192.168.0.66<br />I Rebooted the router with the WPS button &quot;clicked&quot; like here:</p><p><a href="https://www.mikepalmer.net/tp-link-archer-c7-ac1750-v2-tftp-recovery/">https://www.mikepalmer.net/tp-link-arch … -recovery/</a></p><p>And the leds behaviour changed. After a couple of minutes, I changed the IP back to 192.168.1.2 (gw 192.168.1.1) and I could be able to telnet into the router! </p><p>Then I went back to factory defaults using:</p><p>root@(none):/# mount_root<br />jffs2 is ready<br />jffs2 is ready<br />switching to overlay<br />root@(none):/# mtd -r erase rootfs_data<br />Unlocking rootfs_data ...<br />Erasing rootfs_data ...<br />Rebooting ...</p><p>And Bang!

					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m in a similar situation.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;ve got an Archer C7 v2.0 on which I had successfully been running dd-wrt.&nbsp; For various reasons, I wanted to switch to OpenWRT.&nbsp; I read a lot of pages on the Net and forum posts and performed what I thought was the correct procedure.&nbsp; Apparently, it was not.&nbsp; Most likely I didn&#039;t properly strip off the correct part/amount of the image file I tried to flash.&nbsp; Anyway, now I&#039;m in the lovely boot loop.&nbsp; No!</p><p>The symptoms:<br />LEDs blink in a pattern with a roughly six second period.&nbsp; Kernel messages about the eth0 interface going down and back up (see messages below) seem to indicate that the boot loop has a period of 11-12 seconds.</p><p>To sum up where I&#039;m at now:</p><p>- Whatever is running at boot time, the OpenWRT failsafe mode is *not* working</p><p>- TFTP *is* working:<br />Following the TFTP unbricking directions on the wiki page for the Archer hardware, I set my PC to IP 192.168.0.66.&nbsp; I&#039;m using Debian, so I installed the &quot;atftpd&quot; package for the TFTP daemon and &quot;tftp&quot; for the client.<br />By default, it serves files out of &quot;/srv/tftp&quot; so I put into that directory an image file named &quot;ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin&quot;.&nbsp; I manually tested getting the file from the TFTP server and that worked okay.<br />I then, plugged in the router, powered it on, and held down the WPS button until the transfer began.&nbsp; I could see the I/O spike on the network I/O graph widget I have running on my desktop.&nbsp; I also see in syslog the following lines:</p><p>Nov 20 17:00:34 Redtail atftpd[31449]: Advanced Trivial FTP server started (0.7)<br />Nov 20 17:00:34 Redtail atftpd[31449]: Serving ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin to 192.168.0.86:1106<br />Nov 20 17:00:36 Redtail kernel: [385927.863533] r8169 0000:02:00.0 eth0: link down<br />Nov 20 17:00:38 Redtail kernel: [385930.315291] r8169 0000:02:00.0 eth0: link up<br />Nov 20 17:00:39 Redtail kernel: [385931.041901] r8169 0000:02:00.0 eth0: link down</p><p>So, it appears that the router *is* fetching the file, but it immediately resumes the endless boot loop.&nbsp; From reading other messages in this thread, I suspect that if I were to plug in a serial console I would see the LZMA decompression error message mentioned by others.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried *many* different image files, and have tried stripping off various lengths at the beginning according to different forum posts and wiki pages.&nbsp; So far, none of them have worked.&nbsp; The images tried include OpenWRT CC (both factory and sysupgrade), the dd-wrt firmware it used to be running, and the most recent firmware available from TP-Link&#039;s website.</p><p>What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; I was initially really happy when I got the TFTP transfer to function as it meant that I could still communicate with the router.&nbsp; That bloom has since faded, however, as I have been unable to get past this point.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>@BzowK</p><p>I recovered it with Barrier Breaker for my C5 v1.20.</p><p>@Others:</p><p>Cannot help more, sorry.</p><p>In my case it was the tftp server, my advice is to ensure 100% with other files (a text file or whatever and see it the data isn&#039;t corrupted during the transfer) it&#039;s working OK, it&#039;s easy to have any permission issue or bad configuration in that end.</p><p>Mine is now in perfect condition, I event updated it to chaos calmer.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>@sh4</p><p>Probably with C5 it is working, but I suspect that for C7 - doesn&#039;t.</p><p>Tried different files: original stripped, chaos chalmer factory bin, barrier breaker factory bin.</p><p>The same situation for all files.

					<p>To those who are still struggling at this moment, here provides an extra information for reference.</p><p>First thing first my PC is running Windows 10 64-bit.</p><p>I reverted back to stock this evening when my bandwidth was upgraded to 1000Mbps. Without any knowledge of flashing back to stock, I just flash straight through Web UI. It shows successful message in console.</p><p>However after 2 hours of waiting, the LED interface was still repeating the same pattern and suspected the soft-brick.&nbsp; I found every article about de-brick a C5 v1.2 but no avail. I tried changing IP address 192.168.0.66 and 192.168.1.66 back and forth; set my tftp with different combinations and it stills show no sign of connection. I could see the tftp was up and ready as indicated by the LED indicator (when WPS/Reset button was hold for ~5seconds starting from powering on the router). At some point of time I just want to open the case and use serial connector to fix it all.</p><p>It turned out that it was the network adaptor problem. In order to search the solution, I USB-tethered all the time (that&#039;s one adaptor). There are some other adaptors (e.g. VMWare virtual adaptors in my case) in the list. After disabling all the unnecessary adaptors, and voila my tftp server detected the request from 192.168.0.68 and LED indicator show something new. After a minute or so, good old login page is accessible.</p><p><strong>tl;dr Network adapter setting may be the reason that TFTP is not working. Try disabling all unnecessary network adaptors and isolating the one that matters.</strong></p><p>Cheers,<br />MM</p>									</div>
