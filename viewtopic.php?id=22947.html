					<p>Hello,<br />Recently i switched my dsl to uverse att and I set the uverse to dmz mode.<br />The openwrt gets wan public ip address through the dhcp from the uverse.(it is always same Ip)<br />my laptop is connected to openwrt through wireless (same problem with lan)<br />Every 4 or 5 minutes my vpn client looses connection and must reconnect.<br />When I switch to wireless AP that is on the uverse box I have no problems. <br />Also, i experience problems with internet being slow. Kind of like the router (openwrt) would be sometimes passing sometimes not passing the traffic. Any ideas?</p><p>I am running:</p><p>BusyBox v1.11.2 (2009-09-06 23:21:43 UTC) built-in shell (ash)<br />Enter &#039;help&#039; for a list of built-in commands.</p><p>&nbsp; _______&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|.-----.-----.-----.|&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; |.----.|&nbsp; |_<br /> |&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; _&nbsp; |&nbsp; -__|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||&nbsp; |&nbsp; |&nbsp; ||&nbsp; &nbsp;_||&nbsp; &nbsp;_|<br /> |_______||&nbsp; &nbsp;__|_____|__|__||________||__|&nbsp; |____|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |__| W I R E L E S S&nbsp; &nbsp;F R E E D O M<br /> KAMIKAZE (8.09.2-RC2, r17574) -------------------------<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz Vodka&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shake well with ice and strain<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz Triple sec&nbsp; mixture into 10 shot glasses.<br />&nbsp; * 10 oz lime juice&nbsp; Salute!<br /> ---------------------------------------------------<br />root@OpenWrt:~# uname -r<br />2.4.35.4<br />root@OpenWrt:~#</p>									</div>

					<p>I also noticed that is if start a download that is lets say 100M it will stop downloading around 60-80M.<br />I must restart the download and hope that it will complete.&nbsp; If i switch directly to Uverse ATT wireless router i have no problems and download completes fine.<br />I am not sure how to troubleshoot that?<br />Is it the iptable,kernel&nbsp; that is not working correctly? It looks like the router blocks connection or is not able to keep track of them? <br />Any ideas where to start?</p>									</div>

					<p>This is what i found out from the capture both on the laptop and the router.<br />On the laptop:<br />it send the acks for the next packet , receives reassembled segment and sends another ack which never gets to the outside work and immediately after that there is a icmp message that says that destination is not available (the site from which i was downloading file)</p><p>when i look at the packets on the wan interface on the router i see:<br />it sends out same ack and it receives same reassembled packet, but it also receives two more reassembled packets that are never forwarded to the pc behind nat,<br />just after those the router decides to sent RESET , but it was never send by the laptop.</p><p>so i guess it is a rst send by the router that terminates the connection. But why the router sends reset? Is it because it cannot see the laptop anymore or the kernel routing does not work correctly and brakes at this point?</p><p>see <a href="http://yfrog.com/59imagehej">http://yfrog.com/59imagehej</a><br />for the last packets on the wireshark i explained above<br />i deleted my wan ip</p><p>thx</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blwegrzyn</strong> on 19 Jan 2010, 07:13)</p>
