					<p>Hi! </p><p>Since I have installed Backfire on my WL500gx I am experiencing problems when downloading at higher speeds. When I am downloading a file (it can be a single connection HTTP download) at speed higher than 1.3 MB/s I can not establish any new connection. I can not browse the web nor acces the LUCI page. In the meantime the file downloads flawlessly at speeds up to 2MB/s (limited by my WAN speed). Any help would be appreciated!</p><p>Regards,<br />over.</p>									</div>
