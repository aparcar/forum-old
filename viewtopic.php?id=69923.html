					<p>Hi, I flashed my TP-Link TL-WR740N ( Ver. 5.0 ) with a beta version of DD-WRT for it ( a &quot;12-15-2016-r30949&quot; version ). But after a while, I found that I don&#039;t like DD-WRT, and I want to move to OpenWRT.</p><p>Unfortunately I cannot find the roll-back-to-OEM firmware file for my router in DD-WRT&#039;s site, so I tried to use TFTP to directly flash OpenWRT&#039;s firmware to my router ( from my Windows 7 laptop, by using the built-in &quot;TFTP.exe&quot; program ), during router&#039;s start-up.</p><p>But I got error when running TFTP - &quot;Connect request failed&quot;. I turned off Windows firewall. But still the same error.</p><p>Is it that DD-WRT firmware does not come with a TFTP server program?&nbsp; &nbsp; Or is it that DD-WRT locks their firmware/bootloader to protect its market share?&nbsp; &nbsp; What can I do here?&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to get stuck with DD-WRT and cannot go anywhere else.</p>									</div>

Think I read on this forum that dd-wrt -&gt; openwrt end up in bricked routers. Just to be safe do dd-wrt -&gt; webrevert to tp-link firmware from dd-wrt (the webrevert to tp-link firmware provided by dd-wrt, not other one) -&gt; openwrt.<br />I&#039;d use an UPS when I flash the router just to make sure that a random power cut will not brick it.</p><p>If you don&#039;t see a login option in dd-wrt forum (I actually don&#039;t see such an option, supposed to be a link to the login page <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/login.php">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/login.php</a> but I see none in dd-wrt forum...) just click on new topic, it will show u the login page...</p><p>At least for my 841nd v5 the webrevert from dd-wrt has some bits added to the start of the image compared to the original tp-link firmware. Probably those bits are added to all the webrevert from dd-wrt (there might be an answered somewhere about the particular added bits but I never looked for an answer <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> , some of them are the same for all and the one that are not the same look to be some sort of checksum).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thedukesd</strong> on 20 Feb 2017, 00:14)</p>
