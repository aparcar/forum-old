					<p>Hi everybody!</p><p>I&#039;ve several questions regarding OpenWRT itself and it&#039;s adaptation to AR9331 development board. I&#039;m just a few weeks in Linux so please don&#039;t kick me too strong)<br />1 - is it possible to change the LAN ports order? I&#039;m using a tp-link profile as a basis but it has a reverse ports numbering, i.e. LAN1=P4, LAN2=P3...<br />2 - I&#039;ve made some mistake in 01_led, mach-xxx.c etc. and now there is no LEDs configuration created in etc/config/system file (it just the same like in wrt/package/base-files/files/etc/config). I don&#039;t know how to troubleshoot this problem, for me all modifications I&#039;ve done are correct, GPIO - LEDs relations/triggers are working. As a workaround I&#039;m using a manually created system config file in wrt/files/etc/config<br />3 - How to create a one-time executing script - I need to make some setup during the first boot.</p><p>OpenWRT guru, please help)<br />Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>
