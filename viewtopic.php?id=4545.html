					<p>Since I have no idea of what router you have I would suggest you first read the documentation in the wiki then try and boot OpenWrt failsafe or try tftp another .bin up(as you will have set boot_wait to on ofcourse).&nbsp; It is unlikely you have stuffed your bootloader program.</p>									</div>
