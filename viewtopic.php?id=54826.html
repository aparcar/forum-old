					<p>I believe you only have to start dropbear (/etc/init.d/dropbear start) and copy the files using WinSCP or some other SCP client you use. If you don&#039;t have dropbear in your currently used image, you might try using telnet or load the image through TFTP using the bootloader. I&#039;m pretty sure you can only do this if you have serial access to the device, though.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geryhun</strong> on 31 Dec 2014, 02:37)</p>

					<p>If the running kernel has the necessary USB and filesystem modules built in you can mount a USB drive:<br />mount -t msdos /dev/sda1 /mnt<br />Then you can access the files on the drive under /mnt directory.<br />ls -l /mnt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (confirm your file is there)<br />sysupgrade -n /mnt/&lt;image file name&gt;</p>									</div>

					<p>Try this after entering failsafe mode:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@openwrt# mount_root
root@openwrt# echo -e &quot;12345\n12345\n&quot; | passwd
root@openwrt# dropbear -R -P /var/run/dropbear.1.pid</code></pre></div><p>This will set root&#039;s password to &quot;12345&quot;. This is needed as there are no TTYs enabled in failsafe mode therefore some processes are unable to read user input. Using echo works this around.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geryhun</strong> on 31 Dec 2014, 13:54)</p>
