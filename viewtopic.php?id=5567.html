					<p>Looking to see if there is a ready made (preferably with gui for my customers) QoS with layer 7 filters avaliable with Openwrt.<br />Everything I see thus far are simple iptables and queue priority based on ips or ports.</p>									</div>

					<p>Have a look at my QoS package at <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/qos/qos-scripts_0.9-1_mipsel.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd â€¦ mipsel.ipk</a>. It is designed to provide decent traffic shaping out of the box for most kinds of traffic. Just install the package, edit /etc/config/qos, then run qos-start.</p>									</div>

					<p>You don&#039;t need to throttle specific ports. TCP/UDP ports from 1024-65535 are considered bulk by default with some exceptions (e.g. small UDP packets are prioritized in order to improve VoIP performance). The traffic is split up into classes and these classes are shaped using HFSC.</p>									</div>

					<p>So there is no way I can throttle say, ftp traffic, to not go over 5kb/s?<br />I understand priority shaping, and thats all well and good, but what if I want no more than 10kb/s of bittorrent traffic to go thru my system?<br />Is there no way currently to do this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes yes, I was just trying to give an example. I would much prefer to have multiple options open to me, or the ability to bandwidth throttle something that does not have throttling in it. (like perhaps smtp)</p>									</div>
