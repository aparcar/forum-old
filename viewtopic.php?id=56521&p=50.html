					<p>re: Updating the top_note.

					<p>When I first looked at OpenWRT some time ago, my interest was in upgrading firmware in my old wifi hardware: D-Link DWL-7200AP, D-Link DWL-810+, and a Linksys/Cisco WET610N. I checked the ToH, and went away thinking that there was no support. In fact, the ToH still reflects that.</p><p>Now this discussion has made me realize that it&#039;s possible that these devices may be supported after all. Any suggestions re how I could determine if they are supported? Or is this just a waste of time die to the age/technology in these boxen?</p>									</div>
