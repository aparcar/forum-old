					<p>Hi! I&#039;m trying to create a time capsule with TP-Link 3600 router and Barrier Breaker 14.07-rc3 using this guide <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/timemachine">http://wiki.openwrt.org/timemachine</a> , but can&#039;t make the HFS partition to mount as Read-Write, it keeps mounting in RO despite the &#039;rw&#039; option and &#039;-w&#039; flag.</p><p>Long story:<br />First, I updated from Attitude Adjustment, installed packages for mounting the hfs usb drive, and found that &#039;/dev/sda2&#039; always mounts in read-only. Always. Then I re-plugged the drive into other usb port, and found that &#039;/dev/sdb2&#039; (though it&#039;s the same disk!) mounts read-write without a fuss.<br />But then, when I tried to set up a network share, Opkg said that there is no neither &#039;netatalk&#039; nor &#039;samba36-server&#039; available (yes,&nbsp; I did &#039;opkg update&#039;)</p><p>I thought that my sysupgrade got corrupted, and repeated it.<br />Et voila - I have all the packages available, but now my usb drive becomes &#039;sda&#039; no matter what port I plug it in!!<br />And if I force the drive to be &#039;sdb&#039; by pluggin in usb stick first, I still can&#039;t mout it in read-write anymore.</p><p>How on Earth?! It&#039;s still the same Barrier Breaker 14.07-rc3!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>leoric</strong> on 26 Aug 2014, 15:12)</p>

					<p>HFS support in Linux is old and horrible, using EXT4 or any other native Linux filesystem is a much better choice. You don&#039;t need HFS for Timemachine.</p>									</div>
