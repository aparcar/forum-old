					<p>I need to do a custom build, however after my first attempts failed (to boot) I thought I&#039;d see if I could build working firmware at all.&nbsp; My take on the documentation is that rebuilding RC3 should be about as simple as downloading whiterussian_rc3.tar.bz2, extracting it, and running make twice (saving the defaults as the configuration).&nbsp; When I do that I get a openwrt-wrt54gs_v4-squashfs.bin that is 1635328 bytes (the distributed version is 1573888 bytes).&nbsp; Worse yet, the version I build won&#039;t boot on the router.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get any build errors.<br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some simple step, any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I still can&#039;t build firmware which matches the rc3 distribution, I&#039;d like to know why?&nbsp; However, I can build working firmware from the whiterussian branch of the svn repository.&nbsp; There is one problem with it... /tmp appears to be mapped to ram, but does not show up to &#039;df&#039;.&nbsp; Anyone know why that would be?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>
