					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m running Kamikaze 8.09.2 on (r18961) on an old Netgear WGT634U and it is working great. Has anyone had any experience with running Backfire 10.03 on Netgear WGT634U?</p><p>... and why are there two firmware images (openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx and openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx2) published in the download page (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/brcm47xx/backfire/10.03/brcm47xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 â€¦ /brcm47xx/</a>)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Looking at the changelog doesn&#039;t reveal much reason to change from Kamikaze to Backfire, especially if MMCM is correct that we are limited to 54mbit&#039;s on ath5k....</p><p>Is there a reason to upgrade that I am missing here?</p>									</div>
