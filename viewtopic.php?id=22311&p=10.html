					<p>On the note of wireless performance, aside from the HT40 issues: I should add that when I created the tracker build that is currently circulating, I accidentally built the ath9k/mac80211 drivers with debugging features turned on. (I forgot to cleanse my config from some previous development work...)</p><p>I don&#039;t know if these debug features have any noticeable impact on performance, or if they just cause driver bloat and/or eat CPU...but it&#039;s one more thing that we can look into.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I tried using x-wrt interface and it doesn&#039;t have a fully functional ui for some areas like setting channels for wireless for instance. I switched back to luci, installed ntp client for time synchronization and changed firewall wan incoming traffic from reject to drop and everything appears to be working fine (including wireless channel bonding, using 157 right now...must just be certain channels that work either with openwrt or with my adapter but I don&#039;t care as it works fine at 157!). Thanks OpenWRT and essdz for making the image I am currently using. Lots of cool packages I can play with since I updated opkg.conf with the correct address for trunk.</p><p>Btw I don&#039;t really notice any substantial impact in network performance with the debug mode you mentioned essdz. Maybe I just don&#039;t notice it because I don&#039;t use enough traffic on the network to see an impact or whatever but everything works for my standards. Just FYI. The test image you posted will work fine for my purposes until another image is posted or i feel like compiling from trunk which I doubt I ever will feel like doing.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skarlson</strong> on 4 Mar 2010, 19:11)</p>

					<p>Please would someone be so kind and confirm an observation:<br /> I’m testing continuous ping form window 7 wireless client to the wndr3700 ip address. Client and router are in the same room with air distance within 5 meters (15 ft.).&nbsp; Two different Intel abg clients behave exactly the same and see 3 % loss with an average latency of 5 ms. Testing the same configuration against an older kamikaze router with standard Atheros abg (ath_pci) I get just 2 ms average latency without any loss. </p><p>The sporadic packet loss badly affects various latency sensitive applications (example interactive ssh). While everything else has greatly improved this problem remains pretty much unchanged through trunk images since November. Does anyone else see the same result or even better knows a configuration tweak to improve the steadiness of wifi transmission?</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t have nonworking luci pages in either essdz&#039;s build that he posted online nor do I have nonworking luci pages in the fresh build (r20016) I am using now which was created today. Only problem I had was compiling it which I found out was likely a problem downloading certain luci files during compile because they did not exist on the mirrors listed.</p><p>I found the following fix for build which solved the issue and I was able to successfully build an image. I followed the wiki except after downloading from svn I did cd trunk and ran the following before make package/symlinks or make menuconfig.</p><p>./scripts/feeds update packages luci<br />./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci</p><p>Quite pleased with the build and I just plunked down a sysupgrade version on top of essdz&#039;s original image which I was using before that to avoid having to set everything up again. Not sure about latency issues since I haven&#039;t run anything. I only did an internet latency test and I am getting the same readings I got while using factory firmware.</p>									</div>
