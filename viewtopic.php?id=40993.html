					<p>Hi all,<br />I just migrated my Buffalo wzr-hp-g300h from dd-wrt to openwrt (Backfire 10.03.1 /LuCI 0.10.0 Release (0.10.0)).<br />As explained in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h"> wiki </a> I just wget&#039;d ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wzr-hp-g300nh-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin and performed the writing process </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r write openwrt-ar71xx-wzr-hp-g300nh-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin linux</code></pre></div><p>Everything seemed to be fine.<br />I have backfire 10.03.1 running on&nbsp; the buffalo. Lan &amp; Wlan bridged together are working fine in my lan environment (NAS, WiFi devices, mac, game consoles, etc).</p><p>NOTE: in the network interface summary I can see both network UP and <span style="color: #FF0000">wan one shows even the public IP get from the adsl modem</span>.<br />Despite of this, in the status overview, network module, I read &quot;<strong><span class="bbu">IPv4 WAN Status: not connected</span></strong>&quot;.</p><p>Obviously I&#039;m not routed out on the wan but the local connections work fine.</p><p>Network diagnostics utilities fail and nslookup keeps trying on 127.0.0.1 (on syslog I can read the ISP DNS entries but somehow they aren&#039;t used).</p><p>It seems that something happens with the dhcpd &amp; DNS but I played around with them with no success.</p><p>Please note that if I unplug the modem from router wan socket and reconnect it to a mac/pc ethernet port everything works fine!</p><p>Could you please help me out on this?</p><p>Many many thanks?</p><p>P.S.: maybe the sysupgrade image is buggy? If yes, what can I do?</p>									</div>
