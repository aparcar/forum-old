					<p>I&#039;m really stuck getting extroot to work on a TPLINK 1043ND and a TP-LINK WDR4300.<br />They both worked fine with extroot on BB RC3 - so I upgraded today to final version of BB and I can&#039;t get extroot back to working. I tried serveral configurations, set the option delay_root to several values (1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20,30,50,120,etc).</p><p>The fstab itself works, when I mount the /dev/sda1 to /mnt/sda1; but when I try to target it to /overlay it doesnt work - /dev/mtdblock3 keeps getting mounted. </p><p>Current Configuration is:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config global
    option delay_root &#039;6&#039;

config global &#039;automount&#039;
    option from_fstab &#039;1&#039;
    option anon_mount &#039;0&#039;

config global &#039;autoswap&#039;
    option from_fstab &#039;1&#039;
    option anon_swap &#039;0&#039;

config mount
    option target &#039;/overlay&#039;
    option fstype &#039;ext4&#039;
    option device &#039;/dev/sda1&#039;
    option options &#039;rw,sync&#039;
    option is_rootfs &#039;1&#039;
    option uuid &#039;###&#039;
    option enabled &#039;1&#039;
    option enabled_fsck &#039;1&#039;

config swap
    option uuid &#039;###&#039;
    option enabled &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Please note that I tried serveral configurations (even a blank one with block detect) and that this configuration worked fine on RC3. I really dont have a clue what was changed in the final version, but there must have went something wrong. <br />Another big problem is, that there is nearly no way to debug extroot mounting. I don&#039;t see any logs that would help. Dmesg output doesn&#039;t help me either:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...

					<p>EDIT: FIXED IT MYSELF.<br />The problem seems to be the .extroot-uuid in /etc. In this file I thought the uuid of the ext-root device (in my case /dev/sda1) is saved. But this is WRONG! <br />In the automatically generated .extroot-uuid I have a complete different UUID than my drive has. (In my case: /dev/sda1: b0d9b852-2e06-cf01-a0d1-b8522e06cf01, .extroot-uui: 215b9a87-be150340-43cef433-ed9e3dde - NO physical DRIVE got this uuid in my router). </p><p>--<br />It ONLY works with this automatically generated .extroot-uuid file!!!!!<br />--</p><p>So manually re-creating the .extroot-uuid file definitely fails; also keeping the old .extroot-uuid before system upgrade fails.
