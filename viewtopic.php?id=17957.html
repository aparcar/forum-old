					<p>Hi, </p><p>I&#039;m stuck trying to use a WRT54G (version 2.2) as a wireless bridge. It&#039;s running KAMIKAZE (8.09, r13118).</p><p>Situation:</p><p>laptop &lt;-&gt; WRT &lt;-&gt; extrouter</p><p>I verified that bridging works by connecting my laptop to the WRT and the WRT to the extrouter (both by &#039;wire&#039;). In that case, I&#039;m get an ip address from my extrouter and I&#039;m able to browse the net. However, when I disconnect the WRT &lt;-&gt; extrouter cable nothing works anymore. brctl shows that the wlan port is part of the bridge:</p><p>bridge name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge id&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STP enabled&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interfaces<br />br-lan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8000.001217d7a173&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wlan0</p><p>iwconfig shows that the wlan0 port is associated with the access point of extrouter:</p><p>wlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IEEE 802.11bg&nbsp; ESSID:&quot;xxxxx&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode:Managed&nbsp; Frequency:2.462 GHz&nbsp; Access Point: 01:E0:98:4E:B0:E6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate=1 Mb/s&nbsp; &nbsp;Tx-Power=27 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Retry min limit:7&nbsp; &nbsp;RTS thr:off&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr=2352 B<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption key:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power Management:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link Quality=88/100&nbsp; Signal level:-45 dBm&nbsp; Noise level=-71 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx invalid nwid:0&nbsp; Rx invalid crypt:0&nbsp; Rx invalid frag:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx excessive retries:0&nbsp; Invalid misc:0&nbsp; &nbsp;Missed beacon:0</p><p>The wlan0 port should be operating in client mode:</p><p>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;wlan0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;mac80211&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;disabled&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;channel&#039; &#039;11&#039;</p><p>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;wlan0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;none&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;xxxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;sta&#039;</p><p>I did flush iptables (iptables -F) but that did not help. </p><p>What am I doing wrong or what should I do to find out. </p><p>Greetings,<br />Wilbert.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t know what is wrong but I flashed an older version of openwrt in the router and now it works.</p><p>Using kamikaze 7.09, and making the appropriate configuration settings lead to the success. </p><p>So I stick to 7.09, seems that 8.09 has some problems with this.</p><p>Greetings<br />Wilbert.</p>									</div>
