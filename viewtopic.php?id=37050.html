					<p>I am running Backfire (10.03.1-RC6, r28680) and I have been trying to get &#039;tor&#039; working with version v0.2.2.24-alpha however when ever i try to run the program with the command &#039;/etc/init.d/tor start&#039; I keep getting the error that i can&#039;t bind port &#039;9040&#039;</p><p>Now this error comes up even if I change the port from &#039;9040&#039; to &#039;9041&#039; so the program will then quit and stop. Please note that all of the firewall rules changed to this new port however the program still refused.</p><p>I followed this <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter/OpenWRT_setup_notes">Guide</a> however I am unable to start the program. Can any one offer me some help in fixing this?</p>									</div>

					<p>can you post your torrc config as well as maybe the output from ifconfig (or the ip&#039;s of the interfaces you have setup)? I would imagine this has something to do with issues there but I could be wrong. I&#039;ve just setup my router again with the guide you linked to (which i wrote) and it seems to be working. only change i had for my config was the interface names, and network ip&#039;s being setup.</p>									</div>

					<p>I fixed a few things in the Tor OpenWRT notes. It should work now.<br /><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter/OpenWRT_setup_notes">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/to â€¦ etup_notes</a></p><p>Namely you have to edit /etc/config/firewall manually and add &quot; option &#039;conntrack&#039; &#039;1&#039; &quot; to the transtor zone:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;zone&#039;
    option &#039;name&#039; &#039;transtor&#039;
    option &#039;input&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;
    option &#039;output&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option &#039;forward&#039; &#039;REJECT&#039;
    option &#039;conntrack&#039; &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Also, older versions of tor fail to start if the nameserver is not configured on start. As a work around for these older versions add a while loop to the start script that waits for the nameserver configuration:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sed -i -e &#039;s/$BIN $OPTIONS/while [ -z `grep &quot;nameserver&quot; \/etc\/resolv.conf` ] ; do sleep 10; done;\n\t$BIN $OPTIONS/&#039; /etc/init.d/tor</code></pre></div><p>If you still have problems find me somewhere.</p>									</div>
