					<p>Greetings OpenWrt community!</p><p>I recently flashed OpenWrt on a TP-Link WR703N and got locked out (Ethernet was not working and WiFi is disabled by default). I soldered the wires to get serial access, but I did not want to purchase a USB serial adapter (could have, but decided not to). I wanted to see if I could use an Arduino UNO I had laying around to debrick my device, so I came up with this small sketch.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/*
  Arduino OpenWRT Serial Debrick Sketch
  Piero Toffanin - 2013
  
  Usage:
    Power off the TP-Link
    Connect TP_OUT --&gt; Arduino RX Pin
    Connect TP_IN --&gt; Arduino TX Pin
    (Optional) Connect 1000 Ohm resistor in series with an Led --&gt; Pin 13
    Setup TFTP server with IP 192.168.1.100/24
    Place your image in the root TFTP folder and rename it &quot;openwrt.bin&quot;
    Connect Ethernet cable from TP-Link to TFTP server
    Upload Sketch to Arduino
    Power up the TP-Link
    LED will turn on during the de-bricking process
    Wait ~1 minute
    LED will flash 10 times when process is over
    Remove connections
    Reboot the TP-Link by turning it off and on
    Buy me a beer

It basically waits for the proper U-boot message, sends the &quot;tpl&quot; command to enter the console and then sends the recovery commands.</p><p>I thought I&#039;d share.</p>									</div>

					<p>Neat. If you remove the atmel chip (assuming they are in sockets on the uno) you can use the board as a usb-serial converter, but your solution adds value.<br />Do you want to add it to the WiKi:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.debrick</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to remove the Atmega chip before I attempted to write this sketch to see if I could use it as a usb-serial converter, but for some reason I didn&#039;t get anything on the serial console. Not sure if the logic levels have anything to do with this.</p><p>I added a note about this method in the Wiki.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pierotofy</strong> on 9 Feb 2013, 02:18)</p>

					<p>I know this is a old thread, but since its linked in a wiki and is considered current...</p><p>Firstly thanks for the sketch it will be handy.</p><p>Secondly, if you wish to use your Arduino as a straight serial to TTL device, jump RESET pin to GND this will isolate the Atmel from its I/O pins and let the Arduino act as a simple usb to serial. Useful in Putty or any other serial terminal.</p>									</div>

					<p>You deserve that beer, this unbricked my router too.</p><p>As a side note, I recommend that connection between tftp server and router to be done using a switch, not directly. At least in Windows 7, it took some time for the interface of the PC to be brought up, so it is better to be always up, no matter what is the state of the Ethernet interface of the router.</p><p>Anyway, the idea is brilliant and saved me a lot of time.</p><p>Merry Christmas! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, sorry for reactivate of this thread but i have a doubt,</p><p>In my case, i bricked my TL-WDR3600 (N600) Samknows Version by flashing it with the wrong firmware.. Now i&#039;m hopping to unbrick it with terminal access. <br />So, i&#039;m guessing if i have to buy a USB to TTL cable or i use my Arduino to do it!<br />Is this code compatible with my Arduino Duemilanove and my TP-link router model? </p><p>Best Regards,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tiagoermida</strong> on 29 Sep 2014, 16:48)</p>
