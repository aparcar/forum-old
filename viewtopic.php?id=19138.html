					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m toying atm with a DLink DSL-504T (AR7), Flash is scarce on this little box and I&#039;ve stripped Luci from installed packages (need room for ipv6 &amp; ipsec related packages).</p><p>Uci seems to me a really good configuration system that was designed with automated maintenance in mind. Despite the valuable documentation available at <a href="http://dev.luci.freifunk-halle.net/docsrv/index.xml">http://dev.luci.freifunk-halle.net/docsrv/index.xml</a>, it&#039;s not imho really user friendly.</p><p>I&#039;ve dug available resources but didn&#039;t find the answer to the following question :<br />Is there any way to run Luci on a desktop (linux, *bsd, whatever), generate a script with uci commands and then execute it on the target (direct remote execution on the target would be even better) ?</p><p>[Edit]<br />Seems from page 9 of the following paper <a href="http://nbd.name/openwrt-fosdem-09.pdf">http://nbd.name/openwrt-fosdem-09.pdf</a> that the feature is planned.<br />Any estimated release date ?<br />[/Edit]</p><p>TIA</p><p>Regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>emss</strong> on 28 Feb 2009, 21:07)</p>
