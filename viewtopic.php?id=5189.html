					<p>I have a wrt54gsv3 that i just put rc5 on.<br />I have used rc4 on a gsv4, put this is the first time i&#039;ve used this v3 router.<br />My problem is that I can&#039;t seem to use the wan port.<br />The light goes on and blinks when data goes through but if i try to ping the external address (192.168.1.220, static) i don&#039;t get a response.<br />When plugged into a LAN port, i can ping both the internal (192.168.1.200) and the external ip, as expected.<br />I do not know if the port worked with the original firmware, i didn&#039;t think to test more than i could get to the original firmware&#039;s web interface.<br />I have modifed firewall.user to allow port 22 and port 80 through on the wan port, but i don&#039;t think that matters if i can&#039;t even ping the bugger.<br />Hopefully it&#039;s a software issue, but if the wan port is damaged somehow, how can i reroute it to one of the other ports?<br />Let me know what info you need.</p>									</div>

					<p>they are both 192.168.1.*&#039;s, can i easily set rc5 to use a 10.* network or is it better to go with 192.168.2.*?</p><p>i loaded the linksys firmware to check if the port itself is physically wrong, and after changing it to 192.168.2.1 and 255.255.255.128 i am able to get it to work as expected as long as i use a static wan ip. the wan dhcp freaks out like crazy, if i refresh the status page i can watch it jump from having an ip with dns servers, an ip without dns and to zeros randomly at very small intervals (it changes almost everytime i refresh). looks like you were right about the subnet bit. thanks for the point in the right direction, does anyone know why the dhcp so strange?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>freecheeseman</strong> on 9 Apr 2006, 05:15)</p>
