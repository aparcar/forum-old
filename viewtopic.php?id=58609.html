					<p>I compiled one image for my&nbsp; x86_64 router and LUci doesn&#039;t let me navigate to finish the configuration, the session expires almost instantly when I login. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s really a session expiration issue but after some seconds I got kicked back to the login page.<br />Any ideas?</p>									</div>
