					<p>I attempted to add some old belkin patches to trunk but the creation of the target profile doesn&#039;t appear to be working.</p><p>I created belkin.mk in target/linux/ramips/rt305x/profiles but when I do make menuconfig all I see is the default target profile. The new belkin target profile isn&#039;t an available option.</p><p>I&#039;m pretty confident the source code is fine but somehow it&#039;s not being picked up.</p><p>I also as a test made a new target profile for another platform (using an existing one as the base, I changed the name of the profile) which also has subtargets like the ralink platform but again when I do make menuconfig the new target profile isn&#039;t an available option.</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kialtech1</strong> on 18 Apr 2011, 22:50)</p>

					<p>Just after posting here I did svn up on two copies of the source bringing both to revision 26717 and the first copy on completion of the update did:</p><p>Collecting package info: done<br />Collecting target info: done</p><p>And the new target profiles are showing up in make menuconfig however the other copy of the source which didn&#039;t show the collecting messages still has the problem so it seems obvious I need to be able to manually execute the command which collects target info?</p>									</div>
