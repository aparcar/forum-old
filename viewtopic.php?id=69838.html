					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have two packages:</p><p>Package A produces an archive (libfoo.a). Package B links with libfoo.a to produce the executable bar. Hence, I&#039;ve added package A to the the dependency list of package B.</p><p>Since package A has nothing to install, I&#039;ve set its install rule to be empty:<br />define Package/$(PKG_NAME)/install<br />endef<br />Instead, its InstallDev rule copies libfoo.a staging_dir</p><p>Now, when I compile the entire image everything works fine. I am able to create bar and load the image to the board. However, if I try to only update package B on the platform (using &quot;opkg install --force-reinstall bar). I get the error: <br />&quot;satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for bar: foo&quot;.</p><p>My understanding is that opkg expects package A to be installed in order to install package B. But, package A has nothing to install.</p><p>How should I address this issue?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
