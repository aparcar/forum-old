					<p>the same day i got it i flashed a devel version to enable ssh and straight after flashed latest padavan from latest sources with prometheus. prior to the flash i soldered and tried out serial ports it is true that the RX is locked. havent tried after the padavan version im not sure if it alters the bootloader as well after flashing it ill give it a try and make a post</p><p>btw for those not familiar padavan has entware support, unfortunately there is no variety of packages as for my scope of wanting to use the usb port with a rtl8187 to work as wwan. i heard the following is possible on xiaomi firmware although i tested it on padavan, making the router a repeater. i was curious how the antennas work because it can work with as a client.. was interested in if the antennas are one rx one tx or not. if so i could hookup a pigtail straight to the parabolic antenna for my scope of a wwan which could be effective. </p><p>freewifimarketing are you still around bro</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrt8</strong> on 13 Apr 2017, 13:09)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s a 2x2 MIMO system.&nbsp; Both antennas receive and transmit.&nbsp; If only one has a signal path to the other router, it will still work but at half the data rate.&nbsp; So you can simply replace one of the antennas with a parabolic.</p>									</div>
