					<p>@gotallofthem,</p><p>Anyway, there is not a final release of OpenWrt that supports the WRT1200AC yet, but we&#039;re getting very close.&nbsp; An OpenWrt Chaos Calmer release is fast approaching, and the last release candidate (RC3) is the recommended firmware to install if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing.</p><p>There is a wifi bug in that version that you can fix by manually updating the mwlwifi driver, but by most accounts, it makes for a fairly stable experience.&nbsp; I picked up a WRT1200AC last month and ended up here for the same reason you have.</p><p>OpenWrt is amazing, but you should know what you&#039;re getting into.&nbsp; You can do most of the standard configuration from the web interface (Luci), but you should have some familiarity with Linux and be comfortable accessing the router via an SSH client if you have problems or need to utilize more advanced configurations.&nbsp; Basically, what I am saying is that OpenWrt is a completely different ballgame from DD-WRT.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;ll never go back.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 9 Aug 2015, 18:24)</p>

Having a processor (V2) that runs cooler under load (probably because consumes less volts), is really an advantage for Linksys, because they can save installing a fan in every router. They probably save 50¢ per sale, and if they sell 1 million, would save 500,000 dollars (Example Math). That&#039;s really the way they look at things as they aren&#039;t doing it because they are looking out for the customer. They are looking out for themselves and to stay profitable. </p><p>I only have 1 ac device, and it runs much better with OpenWrt wifi drivers than stock.&nbsp; I just ran a speed test with the laptop capable of AC speeds..</p><p>This is what Luci says is connected &gt;&nbsp; -62 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp; -90 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp; 780.0 Mbit/s, MCS 0, 20MHz&nbsp; &nbsp; 702.0 Mbit/s, MCS 0, 20MHz</p><p>Actual throughput during a speed test &gt; 251.77mbps</p><p>That&#039;s the speed with no tweaking, and I&#039;m completely happy with that though, I&#039;d understand why some would feel underwhelmed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 9 Aug 2015, 19:44)</p>

Each time I went and did some time thing else instead of using the computer other wise it would have crashed on me even more times. I do not know what is going on here. I just do not understand.</p></blockquote></div><p>Sounds like memory got corrupted or bad hard drive sector.&nbsp; Your computer might crash from bad network driver but it is highly unlikely that a sound OS would crash due to OpenWRT on any router.&nbsp; Because of this please post this on your OS&#039;s forum not here.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well it is still possible. Am I right. When I look at how my firefox browser is behaving with constant network connection problems and that sort of stuff I am not surprised that eventually the OS would crash. I am really upset that I did not wait for the final release and instead went with the RC3. This is just agonizing and I can not do any thing now because I have this room mate that is always online due to internet addiction so I have to wait until the end of August when she moves out. </p><p>I am going to have to eventually start using the laptop. There is no point in getting frustrated over this any longer. It just does not work for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>For Boot Loader Recovery I found the below command line worked. It would fail if &quot;-a&quot; was the first argument.
