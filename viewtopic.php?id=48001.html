					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve done a bit of searching and came across these 2 threads:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7493">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7493</a></p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10417">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10417</a></p><p>However these look to be for WhiteRussian, so I&#039;d like to confirm that this is still the best way of doing it. Specifically the last post around DROP and REJECT no longer being supported so just redirect to an unused port.</p><p>Better yet, can some one give me an example of a simple script to just ban IP&#039;s that fail to login after 3 times for the /etc/firewall.user file?</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I liked the first post in your first link personally. I don&#039;t actually know if it works as intended, but I _do_ know that it&#039;s easy to try on your LAN. AFAIK, iptables hasn&#039;t changed much in a long time (because it&#039;s good). I can&#039;t find the word &quot;REJECT&quot; in my latest iptables manual. I don&#039;t suggest using a script like you mentioned, because you may lock yourself out. If I were you, I&#039;d just test the first post in your first link before trying anything else.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your post, I&#039;ve finally got back to looking at this and hand to get the iptables &quot;recent&quot; module installed. I&#039;ve now got the rules</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i br-lan -m state --state NEW -m recent --set
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -i br-lan -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 5 -j DROP</code></pre></div><p>working against my LAN interface just to do some tests locally before I move it to the WAN interface and do some final external tests. However I was expecting the &quot;recent&quot; module to put something under &quot;/proc/net&quot; but for the life of me I can&#039;t find where &quot;recent&quot; is either storing its DB or logging any info... however its clear its working as I get blocked after 5 hits (successful or not, which is good enough for me).</p><p>Any openwrt iptables recent experts out there?</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>
