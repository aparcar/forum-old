					<p><strong>@LogicoZone</strong> Just an FYI, generally speaking, most recommend any adapter with FTDI chips since they&#039;re high quality and well supported.&nbsp; The downside is they&#039;re quite a bit more expensive (due to their high quality) compared to other chip manufacturers (an FTDI USB to TTL or TTL AJ shouldn&#039;t be bought for more than $25 - $30, whereas just a USB board like the CP2102 is generally in the $20 range)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 2 Jun 2017, 09:18)</p>
