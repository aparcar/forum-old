					<p>Looks like it is not possible (((&nbsp; &nbsp;(at least without pulsaudio)</p><p>I installed bluetooth suppot, added a2snk service, configured bt classes, pincodes etc. My PC and android devices can see my router as A2DP receiver, but cannot play sound with it. And I probably understand why - nobody transfers sound received from sdp a2snk service to soundcard. Google says &quot;You need bluez-alsa&quot;, but there is no this package in BB (rc3) repository <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />(((</p><p>May be Im not right. Please, correct me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilla</strong> on 14 Sep 2014, 09:46)</p>
