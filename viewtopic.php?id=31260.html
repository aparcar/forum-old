					<p>Hi:</p><p>My setup consists of two RouterstationPro with Backfire 10.03 rc5, one as NATed route to inet, the other as routed AP between 3 radio networks and a wire network, so there are 4 networks (192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.3.0/24, 192.168.4.0/24). Over wired network UPnP works fine, but over radio neither discovery nor announcement work. It seems like my radio router isn&#039;t routing multicast at all, so SSDP packets aren&#039;t forwarded. I&#039;ve tried smcroute to configure multicast routes, igmpproxy, but fails due to de it&#039;s very unidirectional nature, realyd between radios and wire, and so on... I&#039;m even doubting if multicast routing is working at all on router. My last chance is scripting a forwarder using miniupnpd and miniupnpc, but it&#039;s by far the worst solution. Any idea? Anyone has succeeded in a setup like this?</p><p>Thanks for your comments!</p>									</div>
