					<p>I have seen a product named &quot;CamrRanger&quot;,but it&#039;s just based on TL-MR3040. This product &quot; allows near complete wireless control of your Canon or Nikon DSLR directly from your iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch&quot;.You can see it from the URL below: <br /><a href="http://www.camranger.com">http://www.camranger.com</a> </p><p>So I want to know can we get this function by installing OpenWRT?If not,can some Gurus develop it? <br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Feel yourself lucky dear. I was just looking ways to connect to camranger via TPlink router. I think its possible if you can ask a friend to give it to you. take backup of its firmware and install on flashed Tplink router. Offcourse you need camranger app serial number. </p><p>and be lucky part is here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />))</p><p>Go install <br /><a href="http://dslrcontroller.com/">http://dslrcontroller.com/</a><br />Application and Wifi stick application. For OpenWrt firmware for TPlink&nbsp; <a href="http://dslrcontroller.com/guide-wifi_mr3040.php">http://dslrcontroller.com/guide-wifi_mr3040.php</a>&nbsp; <br />You pay 9$</p><p>Feel more lucky here<br /><a href="https://code.google.com/p/dslrdashboard/">https://code.google.com/p/dslrdashboard/</a><br />install application and TPlink 3040 openwrt firmware on the website. </p><p>it is free <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>I think these are only for tplink 3040 router Version 1.xx and 2.xxx ....</p><p>I am not a firmware maker. But it is so simple to do. Thanks to these people. Specially DslrDashboard developer for fantastic work and keeping it all free. </p><p>My request to developers. Please! Make a simple tutorial to install gphoto on openwrt. we are just novice users.</p>									</div>

					<p>CamRanger is in fact based on OpenWrt + some proprietary software:<br />/etc/openwrt_release has this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>DISTRIB_ID=&quot;OpenWrt&quot;

					<p>hi <br />heffer thanks for reply. camranger is using tplink hardware and openwrt firmware. If we have a camranger user who can provide its openwrt fimware backup than i think we can use camranger. TPlink is 150mbps router and this is only bottleneck at the moment. I hope in future we can have faster speed routers.</p><p>gphoto is a different solution.</p>									</div>
