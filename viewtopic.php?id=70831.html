					<p>Do not connect to a 9 pin RS-232 serial port.&nbsp; &nbsp;The voltage levels are wrong, and will cause damage.&nbsp; Also &quot;1&quot; bits are a negative voltage on the port and &quot;0&quot; bits are positive, which is opposite what the SoC requires. You can connect if you have a converter that inverts the logical signal and outputs at 3.3 volts.&nbsp; Basically using the level converter chip that drives the RS-232 lines in reverse.</p><p>Most people don&#039;t mess with 9 pin ports at all and use a &quot;USB to TTL serial&quot; adapter.</p>									</div>
