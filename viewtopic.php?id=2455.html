					<p>Hi,</p><p>In the last few weeks, I was talking with Linksys support about this wireless router with an integrated DOCSIS cablemodem, and they made a mistake <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; telling me that it runs Linux - I have some odd feelings about this, most of the cablemodems run some kind of an RTOS, but let&#039;s say that support knows what they&#039;re saying.<br />However, they were unable to provide neither the firmware nor the GPL tarball for it, I got a promise that it will be available in the next few months. Now, does anyone know if this router uses iptables or not - and really runs Linux? If it does, and Linksys will not release anything in the near future, we might want to file a case at gpl-violations.org about this.</p><p>-w-</p>									</div>
