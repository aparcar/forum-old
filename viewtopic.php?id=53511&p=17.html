					<p>I left my router on the shelve for a while as it was behaving a bit strange breaking down at 1 Megabyte/s when my internet is 3.7 Megabyte/s. So I see there is new images ready, it will be sufficient to just flash the sysupgrade through shell and it will wipe all the configuration I have on it? (no serial to install bootimage etc) I only need WAN port working which I did with a pretty messy bridge set-up last time. Would have been best if the DSL/Wan switch could be working so one could easily use both without conflicts.</p><p>If you remember @scapi: I had tx ring errors too, wondered if that was due to eeprom or possibly some conflicts with the driver in my set-up F3. The device is old but not that old, I think it should handle 4 Megabyte/s, I have a older linksys which is slower than that running OpenWRT but its very very old. If you think it can push through that stable now I&#039;ll be very happy to use it again. If it doesn&#039;t, well, I&#039;ll be happy to send it to somebody who wants a working F3 that used to be branded. Having to run a dedicated server for dnsmasq right now because my Asus doesn&#039;t let me modify that.</p><p>When I set-up my fathers router for him I noticed how they sent him some pretty good Inteno routers (two, one for LAN and a separate one only for sending Wi-Fi over LAN w/USB) running OpenWRT customized by them as default. Pretty sweet router I envy him for having such an ISP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>courfazor</strong> on 9 Nov 2015, 21:38)</p>

If you plan to use them on Windows 10, I heard a lot of people have been having driver issues. I myself am locked to windows 8.1 for the time being due to Windows 10 having a huge list of legacy problems, which is quite bad considering their aggressive stance to get people to upgrade.

The new OpenWRT interface looks great, but is a bit irritating since I&#039;m so used to the old one <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />The first things I noticed: the power2 LED needs to be disabled so it doesn&#039;t shine red all the time on my router, but it might be that this will turn green if it gets internet connection? Moving on I switched over the WAN interface to DHCP and connected the WAN port up with both my current router LAN and tried it directly to the port on the internet output, it can&#039;t get the DHCP packets and obtain an IP address. I tried plugging it into LAN if it was configured that way and I believe DSL (I believe these can&#039;t take regular WAN anyway...) too but no luck. The WAN light shined yellow when I used the WAN and here are some of the logs: <a href="http://pastebin.com/mQGm9VBW">http://pastebin.com/mQGm9VBW</a><br />I flashed it in the web GUI and selected not to take any settings with me in fear of breaking anything.</p><p>If I need to configure anything myself do tell, but I think that it might simply be that the DHCP client udhcpc is broken? As I saw you said this new firmware was using separate ports now I assumed that maybe the WAN port is now fixed by default. I&#039;m not any good with bridging you see... Another thing is that the local time, uptime and load does not show. I believe these are the dispatcher.lua errors I&#039;m seeing.</p><p>Here is a full bootlog, the router has WAN port connected with my other router on LAN which has a dnsmasq serving as DHCP and should be working perfectly. WAN port is set-up to do DHCP of course, only other thing I did was connect myself on port 1 to get the logs: <a href="http://pastebin.com/fdCRzs6s">http://pastebin.com/fdCRzs6s</a></p>									</div>

I had flashed a version of your openwrt onto it back in jan or whatever and my wifi worked at full speed (40mbit/s) up/down .. I then upgraded through the web gui some days ago and worked fine too.. it was only when I reflashed to stock, and now I am in same situation as the A. have ot use older commit to make things boot (#395), and am also ow stuck with the kernel image issue.</p><p>So I don&#039;t tihink it is wifi HW issue, it&#039;s some other misconfiguration in recent builds.</p><p>Answer to B) was in fact that wrong space in the nboot command btw.</p><p>Well, I get full speed after using the calibration file and as long as I am behind my other router and not ISP.. don&#039;t know why but so be it. I will use the other router as my main entry fw (tomato) and use openwrt as my lan fw/freeradius yaddi ya. Thanks for amazing software and work scapi et al!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>forgetmij</strong> on 27 Nov 2015, 14:37)</p>
