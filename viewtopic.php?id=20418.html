					<p>Hi, I recently bought Lacie Network Space 500 GB. I thought that since it has a GNU software in it, maybe they have to release source code so, maybe it could run OpenWRT a day. But it isn&#039;t in that way. Source code is missing, Web interface is little crappy, every time you shut it down, time is lost, even if you configure NTP time update in the web interface.<br />Here it is a link with info on the product, and system log.<br /><a href="http://lacie.nas-central.org/wiki/Category:Network_Space">http://lacie.nas-central.org/wiki/Categ â€¦ work_Space</a><br />Based on this, it is possible to compile OpenWRT and get it running on it?<br />Thank you<br />Mbacicc</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m very interested on this topic, I have the Lacie Network Space 1 TB. But it has only 16MB of RAM, I suppose OpenWRT needs more memory to run...</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think so. Some time ago I asked Kaloz if a Linkstation Pro Duo could be flashed with Kamikaze and he said no. LS-PRODUO has similar if not the same CPU.</p>									</div>
