					<p>Dear all,</p><p>A n00bish question, I&#039;m sure. But I did search, and did look in the docs, but didn&#039;t find.</p><p>I have 2 identical APs (TP-LINK 4300&#039;s) with 14.07 BB installed. One is set as &quot;Access Point (WDS)&quot;, and the other as &quot;Client (WDS)&quot;. This works great, and stationary computers on cabled ethernet attached to my &quot;Client (WDS)&quot; bridge work brilliantly.</p><p>But, how can I assign a static IP address to the bridge &quot;Client (WDS)&quot; management interface, so that I can access LuCY and manage it?</p><p>When the &quot;Access Point(WDS)&quot; is turned off the &quot;Client (WDS)&quot; assumes IP 192.168.1.1, and thus I can access it and manage it. When the main &quot;Access Point(WDS)&quot; is on, it owns 192.168.1.1, and thus I can only manage the main AP then. But I&#039;d like to also be able to manage the client part of the bridge while the main AP is turned on.</p><p>Thx! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>In Luci, go to Network-&gt;Interfaces-&gt;LAN then edit settings and you can set a static IP address there. I&#039;d use 192.168.1.2, but anything outside of your DHCP range would work fine.</p>									</div>
