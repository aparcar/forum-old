					<p>I have an ASUS WL-500gV2 and loaded <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc3/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">this firmware</a> on it.&nbsp; </p><p>I was surprised to find WiFi worked without issue (several old posts say it&#039;s broken).&nbsp; However, USB doesn&#039;t seem to work.&nbsp; I tried a USB drive with ext2 and it worked fine with the ASUS&#039;s native firmware.&nbsp; I loaded all the usb modules that I think I need (kmod-usb-storage kmod-usb2 kmod-fs-ext2 etc).&nbsp; dmesg shows this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>usbcore: registered new interface driver usbfs
usbcore: registered new interface driver hub
usbcore: registered new device driver usb
SCSI subsystem initialized
Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage
USB Mass Storage support registered.
ehci_hcd: USB 2.0 &#039;Enhanced&#039; Host Controller (EHCI) Driver</code></pre></div><p>lsmod looks promising too:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>usb_storage            35680  0

nls_base                4960  1 usbcore</code></pre></div><p>Nothing shows up in dmesg when inserting the drive.&nbsp; The thumb drive has an LED that should light when things happen..it never lights.&nbsp; I tried other drives and USB devices and it&#039;s the same deal.&nbsp; What am I missing?</p><p>Also, I noticed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/usbstoragehowto">this page</a> talks about a max_scsi_luns=8 parameter on scsi_mod that gave some nasty errors when I tried adding it to /etc/modules.d/20-scsi-core.&nbsp; I no longer have that parameter set.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brokNtoe</strong> on 29 Aug 2010, 07:01)</p>

					<p>You have to build both usb2 (ehci) and ohci. The usb core initialization is in ohci.</p><p>The current svn doesn&#039;t have this limitation.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t know about the config for the website backfire binary.</p><p>My reply applies to the source for the backfire version you are using. In rereading it, I should have added detail on some recent changes:</p><p>1. If you use the default development svn kernel (2.6.34.5) only the ehci driver will register. With the gpv2, that&#039;s all you really need because the hub chip translates low speed transactions to high speed. That&#039;s not true with a router w/o a hub, like the 520gu.</p><p>2. If you use the 2.6.35.2 kernel by changing the target/linux/brcm47xx/Makefile, the patch in patches-2.6.35/023-usb_ehci_ohci.patch will allow both the ehci and ohci drivers to register. This patch allows driver to properly initialize the usb core.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the help.&nbsp; The router seems to lock up after a while.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even ping it.&nbsp; I reboot the router and it responds again for a while and locks up again.&nbsp; How can I tell what is causing the lock up?&nbsp; I do not have a serial cable.</p>									</div>

					<p>Without a serial cable, I&#039;d go back to the backfire image in your original post and add kmod-usb-ohci and dependencies to the modules you listed. I just did that and both ohci and ehci drivers register. I can mount my usb drive.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s still locking up when I go back to the rc3 firmware.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even install anything usb (software or hardware).&nbsp; It does not happen if I do not turn on WiFi.&nbsp; Is the WiFi driver still unstable for this chip?&nbsp; If I reload the manufacturer&#039;s firmware, the router never seems to lockup, even with WiFi turned on.&nbsp; Any suggestions on what to do?&nbsp; I think I read that the WiFi driver using the 2.4 kernel is more stable.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp; If so, what capabilities would I lose?&nbsp; Can I still use USB?</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>									</div>
