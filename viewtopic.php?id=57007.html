					<p>Just to update this: the monitoring software I&#039;m using is called PeakHour and they list the same issue on their site - along with the fix for Net-SNMP installations:</p><p><a href="http://support3.peakhourapp.com:8090/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1671186">http://support3.peakhourapp.com:8090/pa … Id=1671186</a></p><p>I think that snmpd is based on Net-SNMP, but the OpenWRT implementation is clearly different (I don&#039;t have the option of using the snmpset command). </p><p>All I need to do is set the nsCacheTimeout MIB to 1.

					<p>Update: I have tested the mini-snmpd implementation, and it does not seem to have this flaw. Because it is a minimal SNMP implementation, it is missing many variables, but it does provide transmit/receive bytes. (For example, it&#039;s missing ifSpeed, so it&#039;s not possible to calculate %utilization, and it&#039;s also missing a lot of other variables...)</p><p>To use mini-snmpd:<br />- Uninstall snmpd and snmpd-utils (if already installed). You may see a warning about leaving the snmpd config file. That&#039;s OK.<br />- Use the LuCI web gui to install mini-snmpd.<br />- SSH into the router and edit /etc/config/mini-snmpd. Change these lines:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- option enabled 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- option contact &#039;whatever-you-want-sysContact-to-be&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- option location &#039;whatever-you-want-sysLocation-to-be&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Note: sysName is set automatically from the Hostname of the main LuCI web page<br />- Save the changes.<br />- In the LuCI web interface goto System -&gt; Startup. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Click the Disabled button for mini-snmpd to make it say Enabled (this will cause it to start when the router reboots)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Click the Restart button to restart mini-snmpd and force it to read the new config file</p><p>You can also read the HOWTO page at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/mini_snmpd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/mini_snmpd</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 27 Apr 2015, 00:30)</p>

If you&#039;re simply tracking trends, then 5 minutes is sufficient. But if you&#039;re troubleshooting, or if you need better granularity data, more frequent polling is essential.</p><p>I used to spend a lot of time with the InterMapper network monitoring software. Its default polling interval was 30 seconds. Institutions large and small used it to get a good handle on the traffic dynamics across hundreds or thousands of routers/devices.</p><p>InterMapper also had a &quot;manual repoll&quot; facility that let you re-query the device to see what&#039;s happening *right now*. This was invaluable when you were troubleshooting, and thought that you had fixed a problem. Waiting around for the next five-minute poll is not appealing, so you could re-poll at any time.</p>									</div>

Until a few months ago, I would have agreed wholeheartedly; indeed, in our enterprise environment 5 minutes is our standard polling rate.</p><p>However, I recently started to use a product called PeakHour (<a href="http://peakhourapp.com">http://peakhourapp.com</a>) at home, which places a realtime router bandwidth chart in the menu bar of my Mac. I also use iStat Menus, which shows my Mac bandwidth utilization next to it. </p><p>When apparent network slowness occurs I can now compare at a glance the bandwidth utilization of my broadband connection and my Mac. This helps me understand whether I&#039;m the sole user of bandwidth in the house (or if the sudden slowdown in performance may be due to Stampy Longnose streaming in HD elsewhere in the house...)</p><p>Once you&#039;re used to this level of insight, it&#039;s difficult to be without it. Definitely overkill in the enterprise but very useful at home. From other conversations, I understand the DD-WRT has no issues (my old Billion 7800N with stock firmware was fine also).</p>									</div>
