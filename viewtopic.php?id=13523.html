					<p>hello, im a bit confused about gpio and the atheros build. i want to enable or disable wireless through the button which is installed in my fonera. if wlan is on, the wlan led should be on if not, the led is should be dark.</p><p>per default the is no gpio support in the latest svn build. but there is a module called proc_gpio available. there are 2 open tickets, <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1172">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1172</a> and <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1861">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1861</a>. It looks like #1861 would be a better choice. in a message i also read that the madwifi driver should enable/disable the led which i couldnt confirm.</p><p>is ticket #1861 still actual, if yes is there a reason why this patch never made it into the trunk?<br />cheers<br />michu</p>									</div>

					<p>ok I created a new ticked (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2761">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2761</a>) with an updated gpio package. I also wrote a little how-to here: <a href="http://www.neophob.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/134-Openwrt-Atheros-build-and-GPIO.html">http://www.neophob.com/serendipity/inde â€¦ -GPIO.html</a></p>									</div>
