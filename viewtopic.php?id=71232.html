					<p>Ive managed to acquire an aerohive sr2024 PoE switch, I know that switches arent usually the targeted devices for OpenWrt but I was wondering if anyone has ever tried to flash any alternate firmware to one of these.</p><p>I haven&#039;t even had a chance to power it up yet and don&#039;t know much about it other than it DID work and its on its way to me. Any help you guys can lend is greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>
