					<p>Hello all, I&#039;m not new to OpenWRT and Linux, but I&#039;m new to compiling and installing OpenWRT/Lede on some ZBT hardware.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been around the forum and finally go stumped so I&#039;m first looking where is the correct place for me to post my questions....</p><p>My goal is to build a custom OpenWRT load for a ZBT W1326 router.&nbsp; I&#039;ve managed to build from the snapshot using I believe the GIT from git.openwrt.org.&nbsp; I&#039;m sifting through the differences between OpenWRT and Lede so I&#039;m not entirely sure which trunk I&#039;m supposed to be using at this point.&nbsp; I&#039;ve managed to get the code, build for the hardware, install the squashfs upgrade bin and not brick the device.&nbsp; (I consider this a major win.)&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten LuCi installed and can configure packages on the router, etc.</p><p>So here are my noob questions.</p><p>1) Should I be posting in the developer list since I&#039;m building from scratch?</p><p>2) I&#039;m trying to install Cake for the QoS rather than fq_codel.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s in the kernel, and I can configure it via the command line.&nbsp; What I can&#039;t figure out is how to enable it in LuCi.&nbsp; I see many posts about installing the package luci-app-sqm, but no matter what I do I keep being told the package doesn&#039;t exist.&nbsp; Is there some external repository that I can get that from?</p><p>Thanks in advance, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have more to come.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure about your first question, I am quite new myself but in response to your second question, have you actually pressed the update lists button first? You need to get the package lists by pressing that button which is on the software page under system. If you are connected by SSH or Telnet you can run this command...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update</code></pre></div>									</div>
