					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I am trying to fix a this WR703N that my friend messed up. After flashing the default OpenWRT (<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factorybin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … factorybin</a>) my friend flashed the NAS version of the Big Squeeze firmware was flashed ( 28854-1229). Unfortunately the little box has stop responding and connecting to it became impossible.</p><p>I am able to get into failsafe mode (I think) by doing the following: I powercycle the WR703N. The LED light is on but doesn&#039;t flash at first and as soon as it starts flashing I press the reset button. At that point, the LED light flashes constantly but at a faster rate and I can connect to it through telnet (I use Windows, so I connect through the command line using the built-in telnet). I am able to access WR703N from there, but unable to flash to older firmware (when I look using opkg I see that there is no firmware on the WR703N).</p><p>At this point, I want to upload the vanilla OpenWRT firmware, but find myself unable to (I can&#039;t connect using SCP or TFTP). Perhaps I am doing something wrong? Can someone direct me? From my PC I can ping the WR703N (ping 192.168.1.1) but unable to ping my PC (which I set to 192.168.1.2 subnet 255.255.255.0).</p>									</div>

It is possible to close the router completely with a powered 4-port hub and 2x16GB flashdisks in there. It is also room for a second USB port with enough space between them if I move the present one a few millimeter to the right. It needs to be disconnected and flipped upside down anyways, so that is not a big deal. Unfortunately I just semibricked my router when I tried to flash DD-WRT for the TP-LINK 903ND, but I can access it via TTL so no biggie. Im kinda getting fed up with OpenWRT as its seems to be so unstructured and incompatibility between packages so I did have a go at DD-WRT which I know works nicely with extroot.</p>									</div>

Remember you need to connect the ethernet port of WR703N to a lan port of an router as the port is configured to get ip via dhcp. If you are not able to access using name (nas) you will need to try ip address instead.</p><p>You are not doing anything wrong. The failsafe mode only provides telnet access. Could you cat /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless. If you do opkg list_installed you will get nothing back as these status information has been removed on purpose to save space.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>s7mx1</strong> on 12 Jan 2012, 12:22)</p>

I did have a go again and got it back to life. I initially did follow the instructions for the TL-MR3420, which has a few differences from the ones for the TL-MR3020, which are more accuarate. I had to set environments first, device IP and server IP, even though it automatically put out that it had 192.168.1.111 and expected the image to be at 192.168.1.100. So, even though it supposed to be preconfigured I did the steps and set environment anyway (same adresses). After that it suddenly wanna talk and soon it was back alive.</p><p>Thanks for the support.</p><p>Anyhow, I did order me a USB flash programmer so I really can go havoc on the MR11U. <br /><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-E-Eprom-and-Serial-Flash-Programmer-bios-router-/270888492134?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3f12365c66">http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-E-Eprom-and … 3f12365c66</a><br />It seems to do the job from what I can see in terms of support and the software. I also did some research on the 8-SOPs available for this device and it seems like 200MIL is limited to 64Mbit/8MB. However, when I look at the&nbsp; 16-SOP diagram the inner 8 pins is unused, and the outer is eqvivalent to the 8-SOP pins, just in a different order. This means that I can drop in a hefty 256Mbit/32MB flash in there somewhere, if uboot allows the mod that is.. I saw somwhere on the forum a TL-MR3420 with a 16MB flash, and he did mod the uboot to make it accept it. I&#039;m ging to Singapore in a couple of days and will have a couple of hours to spend on chasing some flash chips.</p><p>/Len</p></blockquote></div><p>@Lennong<br />Maybe the AR9331 can max support 16MB SPI flash,you can get some info from the MR11U raw UART message,i backup it here:<br /><a href="http://blog.chinaunix.net/space.php?uid=26082927&amp;do=blog&amp;id=3058458">http://blog.chinaunix.net/space.php?uid … id=3058458</a><br />the:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Booting image at 9f020000 ...</p></blockquote></div><p>show there only reserve 16MB memory map space when do SoC chip design.</p></blockquote></div><p>Good info, thanks! Didn&#039;t find any SOPs in Singapore but I did find a 32GB Cruzer Edge for 42 Sing...nice.&nbsp; I have ordered three 16MB chips, should be here in a couple of weeks, just in time for when the MR11U is here. I will have to come up with some kind of adapter though, still researching that one.</p>									</div>
