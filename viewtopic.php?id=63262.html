					<p>I have acquired a retired Aerohive BR100 which is an Atheros AR9331 based system that seems to be based on the AP121 standard with 16MB flash and 64MB RAM.&nbsp; &nbsp;See <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Aerohive_BR100">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Aerohive_BR100</a> for additional details.&nbsp; Apparently Aerohive does not conform to the GPL license and no source is available.&nbsp; Uboot appears to be password locked.&nbsp; See log from console port below:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>AP121-2MB (ar9330) U-boot

					<p>Should be quite simple really if you get the right prerequisites. </p><p>First, get yourself a SPI reader. Either go DIY like this post with detailed instructions here (instructions are simple and requirements are minimal): <a href="http://write-code.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/parallel-port-spi-flash-programmer-and-unbrick-wm8650.html">http://write-code.blogspot.co.uk/2012/0 â€¦ m8650.html</a></p><p>Or buy one on eBay for $20. Or get a Bus Pirate device, since they can read lots of things.</p><p>Then connect everything up to the SPI flash chip of the device. I recommend using the power from a orange 3.3V wire from an ATX PSU instead of the batteries in that simple circuit from the blog I linked then you should be 100% good to go. </p><p>Make sure to keep the reset button pressed at all times in order to halt the CPU while you are using SPIPGM so it does not interfere with your flash chip reading attempts. Try without reset button pressed first to see if it works. Or, if you have a hot air gun just desolder the chip and do it off circuit. </p><p>Then, after you get a dump of the flash chip try and run binwalk on it to see if you can detect the partitions and unpack the dump into its components such as UBoot, kernel, rootfs etc. </p><p>Next, use a software like IDA or radare2 to decompile the UBoot binary and find its password (no need to understand assembly, it will be easy to spot since it&#039;s just a quick password check). Try and search for the string &quot;Password&quot; and you will find the correct password pretty quickly.</p><p>Please report back and let us know how it goes or if you need any help. Keep up the good work on those Merakis !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bulanula</strong> on 17 Aug 2016, 01:57)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t know if the original poster solved their question or not, but for anyone who is googling this problem and coming across this thread hoping for the answer:</p><p>Try this password: administrator</p><p>I have not tried this on the BR100 specifically, but this is worth trying, since it works on another Atheros-based Aerohive device that I have.</p><p>Now, a new question:&nbsp; Does anyone know what the password is for the undocumented _shell command in HiveOS?&nbsp; I cannot find *that* anywhere.&nbsp; It would be nice to have, since that may allow reflashing these devices without having to take them apart to access the UART.</p>									</div>

					<p>The password for the _shell command is unique to each device. The only way I have gotten them was to have some sort of support case going that required _shell access. I doubt they will just give it out upon request.</p><p>That said, I have encountered a number of them where that password was blank.</p>									</div>
