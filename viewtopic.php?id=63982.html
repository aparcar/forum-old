					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I have a HG-556a with chaos calmer and im very happy with it. It has everything i need, nice flash, 3xUSB, switch... Its almost perfect except the main problem... i lost xDSL Support. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />((</p><p>So i wanted to buy a new DSL router with OpenWRT support. I have found this web:</p><p><a href="http://geizhals.de/?cat=wlanroutmod&amp;xf=758_OpenWrt&amp;sort=p">http://geizhals.de/?cat=wlanroutmod&amp â€¦ amp;sort=p</a></p><p>So TP-Link Archer VR200v seems to be supported, even its DSL connectivity.</p><p>But, when i try to find the proper 15.05 iso image to download it, i cannot find anywhere... but i also cannot find any 15.05 version to any DSL router!!!... Can someone explain me how to deploy an OpenWRT image into a xDSL router which can keep its DSL capabilities? (i dont really care if is TP-Link Archer VR200v or not).</p><p>I would love to understand how to build a OpenWRT image to any dsl router. </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Regards,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>adcordoba</strong> on 6 Apr 2016, 17:43)</p>
