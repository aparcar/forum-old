					<p>Well, for me it has been working without a problem. And many other were happy with 5GHZ support as well. But tehre have been other reports as well, e.g. someone having issues with a Galaxy Note 3 device connection to the Archer C7 v2. But it seems such issues are more like exceptions rather than common problems. Given the complexity individual wifi setups with lots of different devices, I&#039;d say you have to try yourself in order to be sure, though.</p><p>(For the record: Currently I do have an issue with the latest changes to the Chaos Calmer repository, but these changes are not included in the official 15.05.1 images, so with these you should be fine.)</p>									</div>

					<p>2.4 ghz in legacy mode has been working fine for me in 15.05 and 15.05.1. However a week or so ago, when I looked at the development trunk of designated driver, the wifi modules were missing or too difficult to configure without enough knowledge even after downloading atheros firmware so I had to revert back to 15.05.1 which does work.</p><p>Never tested 5 ghz, but testing 2.4 ghz in N mode did not have appreciable speed differences between it and legacy on mobile devices whether channel was at 20 or 40, so I just left it in legacy since I have 1 device that is a B, not currently connected since I noticed having it connected drops the speed. A lot of stuff surprisingly just doesn&#039;t have newer wifi. PS3 is only G, PS4 only is up to N, no 5 Ghz.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Sunspark</strong> on 2 Apr 2016, 20:39)</p>
