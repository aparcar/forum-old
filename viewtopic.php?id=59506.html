					<p>I posted this on the General list earlier today, but am thinking it probably belonged on the developer list. So here goes...</p><p>I am successfully using uhttpd-mod-lua to run a Lua http handler I am developing--basically, a RESTful service. I can&#039;t seem to find where the uhttpd Lua API is documented (formally or otherwise). I&#039;ve search the OpenWRT codebase, I&#039;ve searched the Internet...nothing. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll end up being under my nose.<br />Right now, my handler is making uhttpd.send(...) calls successfully, but I need to find out what other methods I can use. E.g., I&#039;m trying to set an HTTP status code other than 200 (OK) in the response message, but can&#039;t seem to do that directly by calling uhttpd.send().</p><p>The only reason I know about the send method is because of sample code on the Internet. Surely there&#039;s got to be more, and it has to have some documentation (even if only as code comments), right?</p>									</div>

					<p>You should use ubus and use uhttpd-mod-ubus. It is much easier and you end up with ubus json services that can be used by any application on the router.</p>									</div>

I did some quick research and it looks like uhttpd-mod-ubus is limited to sending POST requests. If so, it&#039;s not really applicable to my situation, since RESTful APIs can use any and all http methods (verbs): GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc...</p><p>My source: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/ubus">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/ubus</a></p><p>Besides, I don&#039;t have the luxury of switching gears at this point. So, question is still open.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update:</p><p>It occurred to me to dump the &#039;uhttpd&#039; object (table) to see what functions it has.
