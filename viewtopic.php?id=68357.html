					<p>Hi guys! Please help me!!!!!<br />I want configure wol&nbsp; host by request<br />This code and instructions for configure and script for wake on lan computer when request client on port 32400 (to server).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>New to PLEX as of a few weeks ago...someone showed it to me and it seemed awesome. So I set it up on an old PC I had at home.
I didn&#039;t like the idea of having that computer run all the time. Of course, googling &quot;PLEX + WOL&quot; only comes up with people complaining how the app doesn&#039;t have a built in wake on lan function. Not a big help.
My first thing was to just use a separate app to send a Wake on LAN/WAN message to my server. This worked just fine...for me. Then I realized that I&#039;d have to install and configure this same app for other people on their phone if I wanted to share the server with them. This seemed really inconvenient.
So, here&#039;s what I did.
Flashed my Linksys E4200 v1 with tomato. dd-wrt or openWRT will work just fine for this. Basically, a router where you can run scripts and inject iptables rules. The router was giving me problems with stock firmware so I was happy to have a reason to flash custom fw.
In Administration &gt; Scripts, added the 2 following lines to the Firewall section
 # Rule to log all new connections on LAN for the plex server for the WOL script to trigger
 iptables -I FORWARD -i br0 -p tcp --dport 32400 -m state --state NEW -j LOG --log-prefix &quot;PLEX LAN Connection &quot;

 # Rule to log all new connections on WAN for the plex server
 iptables -I FORWARD -i vlan2 -p tcp --dport 32400 -m state --state NEW -j LOG --log-prefix &quot;PLEX WAN Connection &quot;
Basically, all new TCP connections to dst port 32400 are sent to /var/log/messages. They look like this:
 Jul 30 14:13:04 unknown user.warn kernel: PLEX WAN Connection IN=vlan2 OUT=br0 SRC=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx DST=192.168.1.yyy LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=49 ID=4796 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=51833 DPT=32400 SEQ=3659947144 ACK=0 WINDOW=65535 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 OPT (020403DA0402080A02144E340000000001030308)
(Note, you could just omit the -i in the FORWARD chain and combine them into a single rule, but I have them separate just in case I want to do something different on WAN vs LAN).
Anyway, I have one final script which is checking that /var/log/messages file every few seconds for new lines. If it finds the above line, it tries to ping the plex server. If no response, sends a wol message.
Here is the full script (I put it in the &#039;WAN Up&#039; section of the event scripts):
 #!/bin/sh

 TARGET=&lt;ip of plex server&gt;
 MAC=&lt;mac of plex server&gt;
 PORTS=&quot;(32400)&quot;

 INTERVAL=2
 NUMP=1

 OLD_LC=`wc -l /var/log/messages | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039;`

 while sleep $INTERVAL
 do
     # Only care about new lines since the script last ran
     LC=`wc -l /var/log/messages | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039;`
     NEWLINES=`expr $LC - $OLD_LC`
     if [ &quot;$LC&quot; -ne &quot;$OLD_LC&quot; ]; then
         # Could handle WAN vs LAN different if I wanted. Just do the same thing on either for now...
         LINE=`tail -$NEWLINES /var/log/messages | egrep &quot;PLEX .* DST=$TARGET .* DPT=$PORTS&quot; | tail -1`
         SRC=`echo $LINE | awk &#039;{print $10}&#039; | sed -e &quot;s/SRC=//g&quot;`
         if [ &quot;$SRC&quot; != &quot;&quot; ]; then
             # Found a matching line. Try to ping the server
             RET=`ping -c $NUMP -W 1 $TARGET 2&gt; /dev/null | awk &#039;/packets received/ {print $4}&#039;`
             if [ &quot;$RET&quot; -ne &quot;$NUMP&quot; ]; then
                 # Guess it&#039;s sleeping. Send WoL.
                 echo &quot;[`date -Iseconds`] $SRC causes WOL. Line was $LINE&quot;  &gt;&gt; /var/log/wol
                 /usr/sbin/ether-wake $MAC
                 # Could sleep for 20 minutes I guess...I mean, there&#039;s no real reason to check again.
                 # Whatever...10 seconds is fine.
                 sleep 10
             fi
         fi
     fi
     OLD_LC=`wc -l /var/log/messages | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039;`
 done
And that&#039;s it. I have my server sleep in 20 minutes of no activity...so it is off most of the time. But, whenever someones opens a plex app (android, windows, etc), it will turn on my server (and yes, it stays on as long as stuff is streaming).
It takes about 10-12 seconds for my media to show up from the hibernate state which isn&#039;t too bad. Not sure where the bottleneck is...possibly because I don&#039;t have a solid state drive for my OS on the server. The script will take a maximum of 3 seconds to send the WoL and a minimum of 1 second (ping on tomato has a minimum of 1 second ping reply wait). The PLEX app might just wait a few seconds for server discovery if it doesn&#039;t get a reply right away. Haven&#039;t really tried to shorten it yet.
Hope someone here finds this useful!</code></pre></div><p>say me please how can i run this script in my router ( D-link dir 615 Openwrt)<br />Where i must put the script for run in in startup.</p><br /><br /><p>Thank you very much!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Corleone</strong> on 1 Nov 2016, 13:24)</p>
