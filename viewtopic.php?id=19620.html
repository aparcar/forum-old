					<p>Hi, I would like to compile PHP with the --enable-soap option, can this be done with the openwrt php sources? would it require further porting or should it just compile? It will require gnome libxml which I have already seen ported to openwrt.</p><p>I have added the php components using the scripts/feeds, and found the required compile option in its makefile. How can I see the source files to see that everything is included? are they downloaded when you run make world?</p><p>&lt;-- out of his depth <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
