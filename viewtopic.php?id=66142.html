					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have (and I am sure I am not alone) an OpenWRT router with a harddrive.</p><p>Yesterday I lost the content of this harddrive due to hardware problem.<br />As this router (with harddrive) is used as personal server I lost all the backups I wrote on it.</p><p>Now to prevent this problem I searched a way to get perfect backup (deduplicated with compression and&nbsp; authentication) to upload it on a cloud (one, two or more cloud). It also means it will be encrypted on the cloud.</p><p>The perfect tool I found is Borg backup <a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html</a>. But there is no package for OpenWRT.<br />Does somebody help us to get it as a package on OpenWRT. Please ?</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>
