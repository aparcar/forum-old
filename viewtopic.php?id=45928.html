					<p>you could try owncloud 4.5. As opposed to OC5, it doesn&#039;t complain about missing locale support. The web interface is still slow, but syncing via caldav/carddav apps on android happens with no noticeable delay (I&#039;m using paid versions of CalDav-Sync and CardDav-Sync).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>renoir</strong> on 11 Sep 2013, 12:55)</p>

					<p>I have been using davical for about two years it handles both caldav and carddav, and it works very well. <br />I have set it up to sever for my family which they can access from all their devices. <br />On the desktops and laptops I use Thunderbird+ Lightning and SOGO connector as clients. <br />On the android devices&nbsp; use CalDAV sync + CardDAV sync by Marten Gajda. </p><p>see <a href="http://www.davical.org">http://www.davical.org</a>.</p>									</div>
