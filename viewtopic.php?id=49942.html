					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have to setup a &quot;TP-WR1043N/ND v1&quot; in our office. OpenWRT 12.09 has been installed.<br />I want to have 3 Zones:</p><p>1. LAN (internal, access to internet, manage router)<br />2. GUEST (external, access to internet, not be able to manage router).<br />3. WAN (PPPoE)</p><p>I now want to check if my ideas are fine:</p><p>1. ZONE LAN: Input=Accept, Output=Accept, Forwarding=Reject<br />2. ZONE GUEST: Input=REJECT, Output=Accept, Forwarding=Reject<br />3. ZONE LAN: Input=Reject, Output=Accept, Forwarding=Reject, Masquerading enabled, MSS clamping enabled</p><p>- To grant internet access for the GUEST and LAN zone I enabled the Inter Zone Forwarding &quot;Allow to destination zones&quot; to WAN zone. (Together with the Masquerading this should be the default SNAT to internet, right?)<br />- To enable DNS, DHCP and ICMP for guest zone, I created some custom Traffic rules (as by default the input to the router is rejected - see above)<br />- To allow and external Ping and DHCp Renew on the PPoE I also added some custom traffic rules - as be default this would be denied....<br />- To be able to reach Guest Clients from LAN I added a Source NAT from LAN to guest Subnet (with this rule it should only be possible to open session from LAN to GUEST, but not the way the other way arround)</p><p>Can anyone please tell me if I am on the right way? I use the LuCI 0.11.1 Webinterface to configure...</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
