					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up OpenWRT with my TP-Link TL-WR841ND. I&#039;m living in a dormitory where every room has this Motorola Surfboard SB4200E Modem which connects to the network 192.168.72.0/23 and gets an IP address for the client (in this case my TP-Link Router). After then the client should be able to have internet access but I&#039;m having some issues with the OpenWRT setup.</p><p>I can see that the WAN interface got an IP address of the range 192.168.72.0/23 and in the systemlogs there is this entry:<br />OpenWrt daemon.info dnsmasq[12987]: using nameserver 172.16.73.254#53</p><p>When I access the router over ssh and try to nslookup something, nothing is found. Also /etc/resolv.conf says for nameserver 127.0.0.1<br />Pinging something on the internet (like google.de) says &quot;Network is unreachable&quot;. <br />I assume there is a port forwarding related problem which I can&#039;t resolve and need assistance. I don&#039;t know which settings are relevant.</p><p>I would be happy if anyone helped me set up OpenWRT properly.</p><br /><p>--lmnsqshr</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lmnsqshr</strong> on 2 Jun 2013, 03:36)</p>
