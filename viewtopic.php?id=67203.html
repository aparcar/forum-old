As long as good password complexity is used, and patches/updates are being done regularly, there shouldn&#039;t be a reason for encryption of data at rest. That&#039;s not to say one can&#039;t or shouldn&#039;t do it, but that&#039;s the basic rule of thumb.&nbsp; </p><p>Best Regards,</p>									</div>
