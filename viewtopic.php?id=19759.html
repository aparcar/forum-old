					<p>The * means the &quot;default VLAN&quot; for a given port.</p><p>It tells the switch which port to send packets to if they do not have a destination VLAN, for example if you send packets directly to eth0 instead of eth0.0</p><p>So if you send an untagged packet, or a packet tagged with 0, and it is coming from the CPU, then only ports 3 and 0 will receive it.<br />Ports 4 2 or 1 will only receive a packet if you tag it with 1, 2 or 3 respectively but will not receive an untagged message.</p><p>Generally this distinction is not useful because most hosts will usually either support 802.1q, or they will not support it at all. But it may matter if you chain another switch, or connect a bridged host to a port that is a member of more than one VLAN.</p><p>For non-CPU ports, &quot;u&quot; is the default. For CPU ports, &quot;t&quot; is the default. That is why you often see it omitted, but it never hurts to be more explicit.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phorn</strong> on 14 Apr 2009, 03:07)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m sorry but that&#039;s not really correct.</p><p>The * is effectively the &quot;default VLAN&quot;, but it is used this way by a switch : if the concerned port receives an untagged packet, it tells the switch in which VLAN to put it (and not the other way round).</p><p>So in our case it means that all packet coming from eth0 (CPU interface internally connected to the 5th port), should be put in VLAN 0.</p><p>As the default configuration on OpenWRT is to use eth0.0 but not eth0, it&#039;s absolutely useless... because no untagged packet are ever received on port 5 <br />(except perhaps special packets transmitted out on eth0 by the switch driver to configure, I didn&#039;t dug into this low-level of OpenWrt)</p><p>For your problem, how do you use the tagged port 0 ? (a &quot;tagged vlan&quot; has no sense, all you have are vlan-tagged packets)&nbsp; </p><p>The PC connected to this port should be configured with corresponding VLAN subinterfaces.</p>									</div>
