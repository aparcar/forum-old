					<p>Hi,<br />Can anyone guide me on solving this error i encountered while trying to make OpenWRT on my Mikrotik 493G? It says :</p><p>&quot;Kernel panic - not syncing: No init found. Trying passing init=option to kernel. &quot; </p><p>I am using TFTPD32 on windows to transfer the kernel with OpenWRT into it. </p><p>And i noticed that my LAN connection will be dropped for about 2 seconds and immediately the error occurs and the LAN connection will come back again. <br />Is there something that i can do to solve this error ? </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
