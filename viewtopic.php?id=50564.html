					<p>Most probably they used a Linux environment to edit the *.img file. Also i don&#039;t know (yet) how to edit those.<br />Or (as mentioned in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/38061">R38063</a>) you have to make a Linux environment to &#039;Make&#039; your own *.img file. This is the regular way for OpenWRT.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>nikki81 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>It is in the supported devises list.</p></blockquote></div><p>Furthermore there is no information on the openWRT Wiki site about running openWRT on this device, other then the mentioned R38061.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Model    Version    Status    Target(s)    Platform    CPU Speed (MHz)    Flash (MB)    RAM (MB)
