					<p>Hi !<br />I would like to share some of my experiences after playing with bcm63xx routers/ADSL modems.</p><p>I was playing with <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Siemens/SE515">Siemens SE515</a> and I found that it has a working console and fully functional JTAG. I got my unit as a brick - with broken CFE - and was able to bring it back to life. I have added some of the knowledge to the wiki.<br />I also got a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Thomson/Speedtouch580">Thompson&#039;s Speed Touch 580i</a> unit. I have compared the board with the one mentioned above and figured out that if Siemens runs linux than Thompson should run it too.... <br />Unfortunately the console is silent on this unit. The unit is fully functional and utilizes the serial port (I mean that hardware lines are connected - I have checked the voltage).<br />I gave it a try - flashed the CFE - and viola - CFE started talking <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> It accepts the commands. The only problem is that then (with substituted CFE) the switch is not utilized. The CFE shows IP address but it can not be pinged nor fetches firmware from connected host.<br />I went futher on - I have flashed the whole flash with the one from Siemens.... And almost everything worked. Console works, wifi works, I am able to navigate the router webpage. The only trick is that switch still does not work....When booting with net cable plugged in is messages that eth0 (the switch) is detected as up, but once the booting process is over logger emits something like NETDEV WATCHDOG transmit timeout ...</p><p>If there&#039;s anybody who had similar experiences I would really appreciate any info... If there&#039;s anybody who has some technical questions - don&#039;t be afraid to ask <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Cheers <br />Michal</p>									</div>
