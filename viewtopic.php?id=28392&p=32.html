But that same error should probably have surfaced to you also earlier.</p><p>Having multiple SSIDs might explain part of that.<br />I tried to reproduce your error with r39056 by having 3 SSIDs on radio0, but I couldn&#039;t. However, I noticed that taking down radio0 might take 5 seconds after the command was given. So, having multiple SSIDs has a clear impact on the up/down process.</p><p>There have laterly been changes in wifi-netifd interaction and I guess this might be related to that.</p><p>EDIT:<br />The changes were made on Dec 2-3:<br /><a href="http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=openwrt.git;a=commitdiff;h=148b41b2f383f13a23d7a64394924c845838f986">http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=openwrt.gi … 845838f986</a><br /><a href="http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=openwrt.git;a=commitdiff;h=21e03633d75c8bc202ed48e0836e5bfce88a0c4e">http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=openwrt.gi … fce88a0c4e</a></p></blockquote></div><p>ok, that&#039;s way over my head..</p><p>what do you think about a script like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

					<p>The bug happens if dnsmasq init cannot resolve the &quot;ifname&quot; state variable in /var/state/network. A common cause is using a persistent /var which causes uci state to not get properly cleared on reboots.</p><p>Dnsmasq is one of the last users of these variables so broken uci state vars do not affect much else.</p>									</div>
