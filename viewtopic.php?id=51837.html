					<h5>Hi there,</h5><p><em>I have been testing OpenWRT Backfire (10.03.1) and Attitude Adjustment (12.09) in the EVA 2.6 and 3.3 squashfs releases to run on the AR7 based Congstar DSL-Box, which equals T-Coms Speedport W701V and Fritz!Box 7170.</em></p><p><em>The ruKernelTool provided assistance in uploading the images, which I would always have to repeat once immediately to get run without issues. The first run would stop at 67 of 63 seconds of the upload progress bar and not run perfectly. This workflow is reproducible.</em></p><p>Unfortunately I don&#039;t see any switch or wifi configuration within the LuCi interface, which renders the device kind of useless to me. It&#039;s running as a dumb switch right now, still I could only use it for programs running on the device.</p><p>The documentation and forum posts are also not too clear about what works and what doesn&#039;t nowadays.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Do you have any experiences or suggestions about the current state of WiFi and Switching/VNETing support?</p></blockquote></div><p>The device is intended to forward a WiFi network via CAT cable, no bridging required so it can publish its own internal DHCP.<br />Another router some ~20m away, DHCPing the WAN port configuration, will take care of being an AP.</p><p>Any ideas appreciated,</p><h5>Jon</h5>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>almereyda</strong> on 25 Jul 2014, 20:21)</p>
