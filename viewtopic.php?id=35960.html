					<p>Hello,</p><p>So I&#039;ve had this router for about 4 months now and I decided to flash it from a old OpenWRT firmware to DD-WRT and I followed the instructions and installed it in /dev/mtd1 then it rebooted and now its bricked. I did not touch mtd0 or any other mtds and the command i used was &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/ddwrt.bin ddwrt&quot; and it successfully wrote it and now it won&#039;t respond to anything. All i get now is all the LEDs except for PWR blinking every 5 seconds. Again it is a TP-Link WR1043ND ver1.8</p><p>What can i do to unbrick it?</p><p>Thank you,<br />LobbyZ<br />(cue OH MY GOD YOU ARE STUPID, GO AWAY FROM OUR PRECIOUS OPENWRT FORUM)</p>									</div>
