					<p>Hello.<br />I have downloaded openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext4.vmdk and using VirtualBox to boot the image.&nbsp; The PC has 2 NICs, re0 gateway, re1 internal network. I have several questions for my setup:</p><p>1. NETWORKING:<br />I followed this: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/virtualbox">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/virtualbox</a> and specified the settings for network interfaces in VBox according to the wiki page. I then edited /etc/config/network as:</p><p>config interface lan<br />option ifname-eth0<br />option type bridge<br />option proto static<br />option&nbsp; ipaddr 192.168.2.10 (this is the network for re1 which has IP 192.168.2.1)<br />option netmask-255.255.255.0</p><p>config interface wan<br />option proto dhcp<br />option ifname eth1 </p><p>ifconfig shows eth1 as having an address from DHCP and I can ping to internet sites (DNS working also)&nbsp; However, eth0 has no IP, br-lan has 192.168.2.10. Is this setup correct?</p><p>2. LUCI - no access:<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start completes, but I have no luci interface (trying&nbsp; the DHCP-provided IP address for re0/eth1. How can I access LUCI?</p><p>3. KEYBOARD: Is there any way to change the KB layout from US?</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>1) looks correct<br />2) stop the firewall or set the wan zone input policy to accept or add a rule to open port 80/tcp on wan<br />3) not at the moment, for that the &quot;kbd&quot; software needs to be ported to provide the &quot;loadkeys&quot; command</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the answer - stopping the firewall got LUCI to show up, but from the DHCP-assigned IP only.</p><p>Is there a way to allow access from the LAN side (192.168.2.10)?<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>The VM where OpenWRT is running has 192.168.2.10 as LAN interface, which is assigned to eth0/br-lan (both showing same mac address).</p><p>I cannot access LUCI from this interface IP, nor does this IP respond to ping requests and gives &quot;ping: sendto: Host is down&quot;. Firewall disabled for debug. The VM configuration has this interface set as &quot;Internal Network&quot;, &quot;promiscuous mode=allow all&quot;</p><p>Anyone have ideas on how to debug this problem?</p><p>EDIT: I realized I did not have a network interface under &quot;Host-only Networks&quot;. I just defined one with the IP address I want (192.168.2.10), then re-started the OpenWRT VM. The address now pings, but LUCI still does not open - It probably means that theservice responding to the ping is VirtualBox and not OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Beeblebrox</strong> on 30 Sep 2013, 19:53)</p>
