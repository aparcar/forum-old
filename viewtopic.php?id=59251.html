					<p>Hello.<br />I wish to install a &quot;long line&quot; of APs in a mesh network. What I mean is that each AP will see the next and the previous AP and if I want to connect to AP #60 from AP #1 I&#039;ll have to travel through the entire mesh and back.<br />Is that something that will actually work? I don&#039;t need to push (almost) any data and the mesh network will be used for monitoring purposes only.</p><p>I have quite a lot of experience with OpenWRT (building my own firmware, playing with drivers at the source level, etc...) but I have never built a mesh network before so I am pretty new to this.</p><p>Will each AP act as both client and master? (IE: will it send out beacons, etc... while maintaining a client connection to the 2 other APs it sees?)<br />Or - is the mesh concept is different entirely (no client/master mode, etc...)</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>look at batman-adv and babel protocols, those are mesh network protocols, that you can use with openwrt.<br />Never tried them out myself, but have been meaning too.</p>									</div>
