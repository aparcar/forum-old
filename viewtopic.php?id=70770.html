					<p>Hi,</p><p>First, I apologizes up front as I am far from being so technical as to understand all commands you might give me to help me on solving this. For this reason, for those that might be so great to spend time helping me, kindly ask for your patient and for kind of baby steps as, honestly, I&#039;m not there yet.</p><p>I have a TP-LINK TL-WR841N v9and wanted to convert it into an access point to extend my WiFi coverage at home. This is what I did:</p><p>- I downloaded (into my Windows 10 laptop) the following file openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841-v9-squashfs-factory.bin<br />- I updated the firm uploading the openwrt file mentioned above<br />- I installed putty on my Windows 10 laptop (never used it before... I have spent few hours learning the very very basis<br />- With telnet, I changed the root password<br />- I have an ethernet cable from my ISP provide device to the WAN port at the rear of the TP-Link<br />- I access the TP-Link connecting thru the new created WiFi network: &quot;OpenWrt&quot;<br />- I installed PUTTY on my Windows 10 computer, set a root password (using Telnet) (remember, always connecting thru the OpenWrt Wifi<br />- As my ISP device has the following IP assigned 192.168.1.1 (same than the default IP for the TP-Link after installing the OpenWrt) I managed to change the IP address of the TP-Link using SSH... now it&#039;s 192.168.1.199<br />- After executing &quot;opkg update&quot; all the files (I believe) where properly downloaded<br />- After excuting &quot;opkg install luci&quot;...I get the following error around lack of space:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package luci.
 * opkg_conf_write_status_files: Can&#039;t open status file //usr/lib/opkg/status: No space left on device. </code></pre></div><br /><p>If I execute the command &quot;df&quot;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# df

Apologizes for that. If anything I could ask for those still willing to answer me, please avoid &quot;flash file xxx&quot; etc... Seriously, I&#039;ll need very basic/detailed steps to be done.</p><p>THANKS!!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want Luci install a release image instead of trunk.&nbsp; It is squashed into the squashfs thus taking less flash space than installing at run time.&nbsp; For most general users, a release image is recommended anyway.</p><p>What to do at this stage-- you have already overfilled the flash so you should re-flash entirely.&nbsp; Download the 15.05.1 release to your PC then scp it to /tmp on the router.&nbsp; Then run a sysupgrade from the command line on the router.&nbsp; Use the -n option to NOT save any settings.&nbsp; Start your configuration over.</p><p>There are different ways to set up a &quot;two box&quot; solution where you have an ISP-supplied cable or DSL modem-router combo.</p><p>* Route twice (aka &quot;double NAT&quot;) -- the modem-router gives you 192.168.1.X on the WAN port.&nbsp; You need to make your LAN a different <em>range</em> entirely such as 192.168.2.X (change the router&#039;s LAN IP to 192.168.2.1).&nbsp; This has several drawbacks but it is easy to set up.&nbsp; The only reason to use this type of setup in practice is that you can place the new router in another room to extend wifi coverage, and pull Internet service over a wireless link to the combo box instead of running a cable.</p><p>* Use the combo box for all routing -- your router becomes mainly a dumb wifi to wired converter.&nbsp; This is useful in a large house where you need two or more APs for full wifi coverage, as you can leave the wifi in the combo box turned on and place the other router in a distant room (with a wired connection).&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case you won&#039;t have a wan network in the TP Link.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traffic stays in the 192.168.1.X&nbsp; LAN network and is bridged over to the combo box.</p><p>* Bypass routing in the combo box -- your router gets a public IP on the WAN cable.&nbsp; This is gives you the most flexibility but requires a special configuration of the box.&nbsp; Also you can no longer use its wired or wifi functions-- it does nothing but feed Internet over one cable to your OpenWrt router.&nbsp; The combo box becomes a dumb converter from Ethernet to cable or DSL signals.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 1 May 2017, 01:20)</p>

					<p>Ok... so here is where I am.</p><p>I tried copying the bin file from my PC (using MS-DOS) to the TP-Link. However, it seems my PC does not see the TP_LINK despite of being in the same network.</p><p>So I then thought of downliding the bin file from the TP-LINK directly from the web, so I run the following command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget htps://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/g

opkg install wget</code></pre></div><p>Which I did... but I got again into the lack of space issue!!!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Installing wget (1.18-2) to root...
Collected errors:
 * verify_pkg_installable: Only have 56kb available on filesystem /overlay, pkg wget needs 180
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package wget.</code></pre></div><p>So even though I was able to find the way to have the bin file into the tmp folder, wouldn&#039;t I be prevented from copying due to lack of space?</p><p>Is there anyway to start all this over (delete everything and start from scratch but doing things right?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jhonyleroy</strong> on 2 May 2017, 20:53)</p>

					<p>That is why you would download to the PC first, since it can handle https.</p><p>However, at this time the OpenWrt server does not <em>require</em> a https connection. If you change the URL to http you can use the non-SSL wget that is already on the router.</p>									</div>
