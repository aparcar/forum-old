					<p>Dear community,</p><p> I had to fiddle around a bit after flashing my first OpenWRT image (caiman - kaloz build) when I wanted to try out another build image. According to WIKI <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1200ac">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1200ac</a> one should always revert to stock firmware before switching between various builds.</p><p>In my case the flashing did not work i.e. the web interface showed normal and signaled no errors but the after the reboot I ended up always with my old OpenWRT firmware (and config, thanks god)</p><p>This is what it took me to succeed:</p><p> - shut down e2guardian / kill remaining processes<br /> - shut down syncthing<br /> - umount external usb storage</p><p>I am not entirely sure if ALL these things were necessary to succeed and also I wouln&#039;t be too sure if my success is deterministically repeatable ... just wanted to share this experience, and maybe encourage people to report theirs.</p><p>BTW is there a way to restore stock firmware via ssh on the command line?<br />I&#039;d really prefer that...</p><p>thanks and bye</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a similar issue and ended up with flashing via USB-TTL-cable (realy greate investment <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />). Since the router is easy to open, it was a work of 5 minutes.</p><p>I flashed an OpenWRT image, but I should work with the stock too.</p>									</div>
