					<p>Hello. I&#039;m using OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment (r30770) on TP-Link WR741ND v1.3. My ISP doesn&#039;t uses any type of VPS, only ethernet and DHCP (via a cable modem).<br />Sometimes WAN connection suddenly becomes lost. It may happen after several hours of work or ever at start. LAN. SSH, WiFI, LuCI are working OK. Ping requests sent from the router to internet IPs are not being delivered. Looks like all necessary routes persist.<br />It is possible to fix it by running /etc/init.d/network restart or pressing &quot;Reconnect&quot; near WAN interface in LuCI. Restarting the modem doesn&#039;t helps. Original firmware worked OK. PC, connected directly to modem, works OK too.<br />I thought that this is a bug of udhcpc. I installed dhcpcd, but this didn&#039;t helped. I tried to run dhcpcd when WAN becomes lost, it prints &quot;broadcasting for a lease&quot; and nothing more.</p>									</div>

Also, I recently have another problem - a lot of dropped packets, it was fixed by adding &quot;ifconfig eth1 txqueuelen 500&quot;, where eth1 is your WAN interface, in the same file.</p>									</div>
