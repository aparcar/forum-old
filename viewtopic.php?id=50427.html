					<p>Linino on Yun, wired ethernet port with default config, running udhcpc.<br />When connecting to some networks, it takes a long time to get an IP address from the networks DHCP server. On others not. With all this ubus scripting around udhcpc, its hard to figure out where the difference comes from. It looks a bit right now as if there may be some race condition: On the console, i see that the ethernet port goes down/up when udhcpc starts, so it might be that udhcpc starts sending the first dhcp request when the interface is down, and then waits long before sending the next. Not sure</p><p>Any ideas how to troubleshoot this better. Any docs other than RTFS how all this ubus stuff works during bootstrap ?</p><p>The problem is that after network bringup, other services start which will not have an ip address yet, so i&#039;d at least like to make this network bringup synchronous so that the following startup scripts only execute after there is an ip-address (or at leaasst with longer wai time - e.g.: 1 minute). Not sure if there is an appropriate config parameter for udhcpc ?</p>									</div>
