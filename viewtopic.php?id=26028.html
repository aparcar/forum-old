					<p>I have an IPK that contains daemonlogger that was compiled to run on MIPs, specifically it was destined for whiterussian 8.0.9 atheros.&nbsp; When I try to install it for backfire 10.3 ar71xx I get an error saying my architecture is unsupported.&nbsp; I really want to be able to get this package installed on my wzr-hp-g300nh router.&nbsp; </p><p>I searched around and learned more about IPK&#039;s but I have a few questions, mainly is this even feasible?&nbsp; I ask because a few things come to mind.&nbsp; I read the wiki about IPK&#039;s but it talks about setting up a sdk for whiterussian, how does this correlate to backfire?&nbsp; Even though an IPK mostly contains scripts and config files isn&#039;t it possible the packaged daemonlogger program is customized for the purpose of the package?&nbsp; Seems to me you wouldn&#039;t include another program in the package itself as you would just have people download the program directly as a dependency.&nbsp; Though daemonlogger doesn&#039;t seem to exist in either the whiterussian or backfire releases so perhaps this is why it isn&#039;t a separate dependency.&nbsp; Do I need to look out for the included scripts not functioning the same on backfire as it would with whiterussian?&nbsp; I ask this because I have a vm of kunbuntu and the directory structure is different than backfire, it seems like a linux thing or equivalent to xp to vista/7.</p><br /><p>I am a noob but I have really picked up a lot in about a day&#039;s time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned so much in a short amount of time and I am working through issues just by searching around.&nbsp; I am confident I can get daemonlogger running on my unit if it&#039;s even possible just by working through the issues one at a time but I would really like to know if I am even on the right track, or if it is even possible.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>possibly you are using the ipk on&nbsp; wrong type of architecture.<br />next, using linux you can extract the file as its a compressed archive.<br />on windows machines you can use 7-zip to extract its contents and then if it has scripts only you should be able to get the functionality on the newer router with little or no modifications.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply mohnkhan.</p><p>I figured out the extraction part but I am thinking the IPK isn&#039;t necessarily my issue, it&#039;s the daemonlogger program inside of if that is compiled for another architecture and as you said I should be able to just look at the scripts and duplicate it on my end.&nbsp; The kicker is going to be daemonlogger I think.</p><p>*On the note about extracting IPK&#039;s, I have ark on my linux VM but it isn&#039;t capable of editing them.&nbsp; I used 7zip on my xp machine to extract everything but when I go to dump something back in it breaks the file structure of the IPK.&nbsp; Do you know of anything that will run in linux that stays true to the IPK structure when adding and removing files?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fusioncases</strong> on 9 Aug 2010, 18:29)</p>

					<p>That is all fine and dandy for your shell scripts as they are non-architecture specific.&nbsp; However, the daemonlogger binary is written in C and compiled using a compiler for mips.&nbsp; What you have to do is recompile the daemonlogger binary for your new target architecture using the correct compiler.</p>									</div>

					<p>Siris - Yeah that&#039;s the path I am headed down now.</p><p>Mohnkhan, thank you very much for the info so far and I really appreciate the offers to help.&nbsp; Before I take you up on the offer though I wanted to try to figure it out on my own.&nbsp; I am sure I am going to hit a brick wall eventually though so I should be asking some more questions soon <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I will also make sure I post everything once I get it figured out and include a write up, I think it&#039;s very important to share such information.</p><p>I do have one question though, is there a chance that the compiled version of daemonlogger included in the package has been modified?&nbsp; I can always ask the person who built the package but since I am unfamiliar with, well, pretty much all of this I didn&#039;t know if this was even plausible, or legal for that matter.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update - I wanted to start with the basics and build my own IPK file first before compiling daemonlogger.&nbsp; Yeah I know, sounds way simple but I just started with linux..&nbsp; I ran into some problems but was able to search for solutions and I now have a IPK file that mimics the one I am trying to get working on another architecture.&nbsp; Using the script provided though I noticed it added .svn directories at the base and also under &quot;etc&quot; in my IPK.&nbsp; Is this something I should be concerned about?&nbsp; I ran the make_ipk.sh in a unbuntu environment if that means anything.&nbsp; The IPK I am porting does not have these directories.</p><p>My next step is running the make file for the daemonlogger program but I am a little concerned.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read some posts about people trying to do this on openwrt and they have had to edit the makefile itself for certain programs (I haven&#039;t seen anything for daemonlogger specifically).&nbsp; This is way over my head, I can edit the file, but I don&#039;t even know where to start on figuring out what exactly I would be editing to make it work on wrt.&nbsp; At any rate, I guess I will find out more about that shortly..</p>									</div>

It sniffs packets and rewrites them to a second interface, essentially acting as a soft tap.  It can also do this in daemon mode.Some kind of deamon logger Program.
