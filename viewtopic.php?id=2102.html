					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;d like to use my openwrt so that when I&#039;m logged on a special user&nbsp; (it&#039;s already makes here <a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=9932#p9932">http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=9932#p9932</a> ), I can connect directly to another ssh machine.</p><p>But if I don&#039;t want to type the password, I have to create public and private keys dsa keys from openwrt.</p><p>The problem is that with dropbear, it&#039;snot possible to create dsa keys, so I use my linux to create dsa keys, and I copy it to the .ssh of dropbear and after I copied the content of my public key in the authorized_keys of my linux client</p><p>But ot doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>I think I&#039;m forced to create dsa keys from openwrt directly... (my linux client have dsa keys so I must create dsa keys in openwrt , I think)</p><p>I have to install openssh instead of dropbear to do that?</p><p>But openssh take a lot of spacdes more that dopbear? or it&#039;s not a problem to desinstall dropbear and to install just after openssh?</p><p>I took my precaution, and reactivate the telnet access lol (here: <a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2101)">http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2101)</a> because if I remove dropbear, and if I don&#039;t ahve telnet access anymore :-(.....lol</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Bye</p>									</div>

					<p>Authticating with keys works fine I have that running too but the dropbear client doesn&#039;t support agent forwarding so you have to enter a password for a machine you connect to from openwrt</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>What I want to do is the other side, when I connect from my openwrt to my client linux, that I don&#039;t have to type a password.</p><p>So I generat in thierry&#039;s home, the private and public key like what you say, and after, I copy the rsa public key to the authorized_keys2 but id didn&#039;t work :-(.</p><p>So I&#039;ve just to install openssh-client, and I can keep drobear?</p><p>Because I&#039;m afraid that openssh client and the client ssh of dropbear may have conflicts together....</p><p>I enabled telnet access for more security, but I want to be sure that openssh wille work lol.</p><p>Thanks.<br />Bye</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thierry_b</strong> on 24 Jul 2005, 17:57)</p>

					<p>I just installed the openssh client it doesn&#039;t overwrite the dropbear client so they coexist in peace.</p><p>Only the symlink to &quot;ssh&quot; gets changed to point to the openssl-client instead of the dropbearclient.</p>									</div>
