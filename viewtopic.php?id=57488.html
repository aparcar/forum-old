					<p>I am new to openwrt and am looking for some guidance on which firmware to download for my EA3500, as I am not familiar with the naming conventions.&nbsp; </p><p>According to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/ea3500">hardware page</a> the EA3500 is supported by Chaos Calmer however I&#039;m a little unsure of which exact firmware to flash.&nbsp; As I see &quot;kirkwood&quot; showing up in the bootlogs I would assume to start in that folder, potentially with one of <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc1/kirkwood/generic/">these</a> images.&nbsp; Which image is the correct one?</p><p>In case it&#039;s important; my router is currently &quot;stock&quot; and is running the latest firmware (1.1.40.162464) from cisco.&nbsp; </p><p>Any guidance is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Unless you&#039;re willing to build OpenWrt yourself your best bet would be to pick up a pre-built image from the following location:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.wolfteck.com/projects/candyhouse/openwrt/">http://www.wolfteck.com/projects/candyhouse/openwrt/</a>&nbsp; I successfully loaded using the instructions on that page.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>If you build OpenWrt yourself you&#039;ll likely need serial access in order to install as I don&#039;t believe the build process creates the file format expected by the stock firmware.</p>									</div>
