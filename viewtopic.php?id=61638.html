					<p>Dear experts.</p><p>Hardware: Linksys WRT54GL V1.1.<br />Was flashed with OpenWRT Whiterussian 0.9 firmware before and runing fine.<br />Wanted to use it as a repeater to extend wlan range in upper floors.<br />Found a turorial on how to do that (I am NOT an network expert at all), that uses version 12.09.<br />So I upgraded that firmware to Attitude Adjustment 12.09 via OpenWRT web gui.</p><p>Now the issue is, that the whole system runs, but VERY slow. Web gui is also very slow and sometimes throws<br />errors with incomplete pages/tokens etc. So not at all a workable environment. Memory seems extremely low.</p><p>Now my questions:<br />How can a downgrade to version Backfire 10.03. This version runs just fine on my second wrt54gl.</p><p>I can log on wrt54gl via ssh and copy a smaller firmware version (like 0.9 with 1.5MB) to /tmp</p><p>I tried to use the web gui to upload Backfire 10.03, but got message, that firmware is not in correct format.<br />I read through some pages at openwrt wiki and that *.bin files are for the linksys firmware and openwrt needs<br />*.trx firmware files? And one can make a trx file out of a bin file by stripping the first 32 bytes.<br />So could a make a trx file from 10.03 bin file and try to use that one to replace firmware via web gui from 12.09 version?</p><p>I am working on my notebook WinXP SP3. Putty is there, WinSCP etc. is available. Small web server also.</p><p>So what would be your advise to get to firmware version 10.03?<br />I think tha limitted memory/space now could be the show stopper..</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>Basically, just follow <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g#using_mtd_or_sysupgrade">the wiki</a>.
