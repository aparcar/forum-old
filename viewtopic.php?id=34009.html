					<p>I&#039;m wanting to set up a few routers as access points only, allowing other clients on the switch (including Wi-Fi clients) to be on the main network and receive their IP addresses from the main network&#039;s DHCP server. I also know that this would normally require setting an IP address statically on the AP.</p><p>Is there a good way of still allowing the AP to receive its IP address via DHCP whilst keeping all the conditions I stated before? I&#039;m wanting to place the APs, leave them and forget about them, but if I need to re-structure the network, I&#039;d rather do it from the main router rather than having to go to each and change the static IP.</p>									</div>

					<p>The Dumb AP wiki entry was exactly what I needed. In my case, the device in question had a dedicated WAN and switch, so it was a matter of following those directions, disabling and stopping dnsmasq, and disabling and stopping firewall. Many thanks!</p>									</div>
