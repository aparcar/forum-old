					<p>Hello I have a tp-link wdr3500 flashed with openwrt. I would like to brige it with my current MiFi router and set a different subnet. That way when the MiFi is off the network is still active allowing the computers to talk. Can someone help explain this because, I&#039;m very confused on what to do!</p>									</div>

					<p>not sure what you are trying to achieve,<br />but you can make the router that connect to wan to do DHCP (pretty standard settings),<br />and the second router to disable DHCP and set the IP of the first router as gateway.</p><p>quite depend on how configurable your mifi is, and how they are connected.</p>									</div>
