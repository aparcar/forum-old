					<p>OpenWrt is described as a Linux distribution for embedded devices.</p><p>Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application. For developer, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">Supported Devices</a></p>									</div>

Your rhetoric is at best counter-productive. At worst, I won&#039;t go in to it. As a network administrator you&#039;re in an ideal position to contribute to the project. You don&#039;t need to delve in to code to do so. You could help with documentation, assisting others, donating, etc.</p><p>I won&#039;t go on.<br />Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>Dave,<br />You say I am complaining, I say I am not complaining - we can agree to disagree. You call my post rhetoric; I think it&#039;s just observation (that can be right or wrong - but you don&#039;t address that correctness aspect of my post preferring to flame instead).</p><p>The reason I don&#039;t feel I am complaining is that both answers (&quot;yes, the project is dead&quot; and &quot;no, the project is very active&quot;) will satisfy me. I don&#039;t know if you have an opinion one way or another, but you certainly didn&#039;t share it here.</p><p>Obviously, you don&#039;t know - but I <em>did</em> write a few manuals (eg., <a href="http://www.rabinovich.org/drupal/node/86">http://www.rabinovich.org/drupal/node/86</a> ). I am not saying if it&#039;s much or not - the reason I didn&#039;t mention it, because it&#039;s irrelevant to my question (whether the project is alive or not). </p><p>Anyway, if yours is the best answer that exists... it&#039;s a very telling answer.</p>									</div>

					<p>I got a notification that there is an email in this thread. It was probably spam - by the time I got to it, it was already deleted (it&#039;s a follow-up to my previous observation that nobody polices the forums). Also, the documentation is organized much better, and it is much easier to find relevant information without hitting dead links in old wiki.</p><p>And, of course, the latest versions of software itself (Backfire 10.03 and 10.03.1) are nothing but spectacular! I have it on 4 or 5 different routers and everything just works! Heartfelt thanks to the development team.</p><p>What a difference two years make!
