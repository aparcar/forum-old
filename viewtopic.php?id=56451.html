					<p>I want to make Intel NUC DN2820 as a router using OpenWRT. I have tried creating the same using the instructions for Minnowboard Max as the architecture is same. I have created an OpenWRT build. But when I try to boot my NUC through the pendrive with OpenWRT image it does not boot up. Neither can I ping it via Ethernet on 192.168.1.1 ( as it is mentioned in the Minnowboard Max page). </p><p>Please tell me where I can be wrong.</p>									</div>
