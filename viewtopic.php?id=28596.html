					<p>I&#039;m currently writing an application which needs to be aware of certain device events. Since hotplug2 had no way to inform programs of events in C, I&#039;m using libudev.</p><p>I would like this program to be very integrated into OpenWrt, and I was very excited to see that ubus was checked in to trunk.</p><p>I was wondering if some developers could comment on the plans for this program/library? It looks like libubox has an event loop, so I can drop the dependency on libev (which I favored over libevent), so this is very nice. I just wanted to know if hotplug2 would be working together with ubus to provide device events?</p><p>udev / libudev itself is not very large, but currently libudev is not packaged in OpenWrt... I would also hate for my program to depend on udev if hotplug2/ubus would be a suitable alternative.</p><p>Basically, I&#039;m using udev to get notifications about usb-serial devices with the following information:<br />USB vid/pid<br />driver<br />path in sysfs<br />node</p><p>I know that &quot;the code is the documentation&quot; but I thought I&#039;d ask too. </p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>
