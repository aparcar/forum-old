					<p>hey people!<br />so i was downloading some files from my FTP server, which is connected to the router by a cable. the queue was a few gigs of files. the laptop which i&#039;m using is connected to the router via Wi-Fi. the files were flowing fine until suddenly all transfers just stopped and then failed. i tried to ping my router and it failed, though the Wi-Fi connection was still up. this is weird. i went up to my router and saw the world and the server LEDs were blinking, so apparently my server was communicating with the internet. then i got back to my laptop and noticed that the wi-fi connection was still alive but no data was flowing to or from my laptop.</p><p>this phenomenon had happend to me before but i decided just to wait and after a minute the LAN came back on. here again i just waited but i had to wait longer this time, like 5 minutes or so.</p><p>what are you thoughts?</p><p>my router is running OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 and after connection recover i immediately checked router&#039;s load average and it was all zeros.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmm, I assumed your &quot;after a minute the LAN came back on&quot; was a typing error.</p><p>1. Can you reproduce it?</p><p>2. Then do it with open shell connection and see further. Hey, you need to write less. Shorter sentences.</p>									</div>

					<p>it just happend again, however no heavy file transfers through LAN were going on. can&#039;t see any problems in the system log, though there&#039;s something in the kernel log that may be related to the problem: <a href="http://ompldr.org/vYjRxeA/openwrt_log.txt">http://ompldr.org/vYjRxeA/openwrt_log.txt</a> i can&#039;t understand what that all means.</p>									</div>
