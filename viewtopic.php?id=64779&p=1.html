					<p>Hi you experts,</p><p>after some years running OpenWrt 10.0.3.1 (Backfire) without problems, i decided it&#039;s now time for a more recent version.</p><p>I have 2 devices, a Linksys WRT160NL and a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH, which were connected over a WDS-link.<br />So I flashed both with CC 15.05.1 and configured the Buffalo as the main router (connected to the cablemodem) with an access-point to have internet.</p><p>Now I want to use IEEE 802.11s to connect them together as mesh-(and access-)points to have only one SSID across the entire WiFi network.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&#039;s almost no documentation at all. The Wiki page only addresses the basic mesh connection between two devices, but not, how to configure the accesspoints, routing, firewall settings and so on.</p><p>Both devices have an additional WiFi-USB-Stick, so they have radio0 and radio1.<br />I would like to use the USB-Sticks for the mesh-connection and the built-in radios as the access-points with a single SSID.</p><p>I&#039;m no OpenWrt-expert, so can someone shed some light on this?</p><p>I found this: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59900">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59900</a><br />But he had to completely disable the zone-config in firewall settings, so this doesn&#039;t seem the way to go.</p><p>If you need additional Informations, feel free to ask.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

So you have connectivity via the mesh link. Now you just need to get the appropriate traffic passing through the link.</p><p>What you do now depends on what you are trying to achieve. The mesh link is just another layer 2 link. (ie same as a piece of cable between two switches.</p><p>If you just want to bridge the two routers via the mesh, just bridge the &#039;mesh&#039; network with the required network at each router.</p><p>As an example for using the mesh as an extension cable for two routers.<br />ie<br />on router A<br />bridge wifi sta, mesh and ethernet<br />on router B<br />bridge wifi sta, mesh and ethernet<br />Any firewall is already in place and no routing as it&#039;s layer 2.</p><p>If you have different networks on each router (ie layer 3) then you&#039;ll need to add the appropriate routes on each router pointing to the mesh link as a gateway to the network.<br />ie<br />on router A<br />bridge wifi sta and ethernet, add route with mesh router B IP as gateway for router B network<br />on router B<br />bridge wifi sta and ethernet, add route with mesh router A IP as gateway for router A network</p><p>Firewall is also dependent on what you want to do.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi greybeard,</p><p>i have good news.&nbsp; i had to manually edit the network config file for the 5ghz mesh&nbsp; to work.&nbsp; it appears editing via luci didn&#039;t fully change all the necessary configuration changes.&nbsp; i&#039;m glad to report mesh works for atheros dual band routers.&nbsp; thanks again for your help.</p>									</div>
