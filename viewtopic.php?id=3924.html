					<p>I uploaded the openwrt files into the router. I can connect to it wirelessly and wired, but when I go to 192.168.1.1<br />I get &quot;404 Not Found The requested URL was not found on this server.&quot; Is there anyway to erase what I uploaded or is there a webpage I need to go to, to change settings? </p><p>Thanks<br />Phillip</p>									</div>

					<p>you might want to use telnet to get into it.&nbsp; have you read up on how OpenWrt works?&nbsp; it&#039;s not something you can just flash and use a web frontend to change settings.&nbsp; if you didn&#039;t use tftp and don&#039;t know how to use tftp, it&#039;s going to be difficult for you to get your old firmware back.&nbsp; what version of OpenWrt did you install?&nbsp; RC4 should have a web interface. if it is RC4, you may need to run firstboot when you telnet to it.&nbsp; if you haven&#039;t read the documentation, now would be a good time to start as well.</p>									</div>
