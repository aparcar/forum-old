					<p>After flashing openwrt with olsr-ipkg and pppoe-ipkg, i tried to seperate the bridge by nvram settings. Then my WRT was dead. 2 Month later (now) i was able to get a serial port module working. <br />Now i had success connecting to CFE by serial port module (first one was not good this one now works for me) but i don&#039;t know what i can do to make my wrt54g work again.</p><p>It is a V2.0 WRT54G. And CFE sais this on boot and than is ready for input at the console, seems to break the boot at this place:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>CFE version 1.0.37 for BCM947XX (32bit,SP,LE)<br />Build Date: Fri Feb 27 15:23:38 CST 2004 (root@honor)<br />Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002,2003 Broadcom Corporation.</p><p>Initializing Arena.<br />Initializing Devices.<br />CPU type 0x29007: 192MHz<br />Total memory: 0x2000000 bytes (32MB)</p><p>Total memory used by CFE:&nbsp; 0x80334DC0 - 0x8043A310 (1070416)<br />Initialized Data:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x80334DC0 - 0x80336F40 (8576)<br />BSS Area:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x80336F40 - 0x80338310 (5072)<br />Local Heap:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x80338310 - 0x80438310 (1048576)<br />Stack Area:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x80438310 - 0x8043A310 (8192)<br />Text (code) segment:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x80300000 - 0x8030F220 (61984)<br />Boot area (physical):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x0043B000 - 0x0047B000<br />Relocation Factor:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I:00000000 - D:00000000</p><p>Boot version: v2.3<br />The boot is CFE</p><p>mac_init(): Find mac [00:0F:66:D9:9D:50] in location 1<br />Nothing...<br />Reading :: Failed.: Error<br />CFE&gt;</p></blockquote></div><p>Anybody here with some hints for revival?</p>									</div>
