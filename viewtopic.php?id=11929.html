					<p>Why did you flash it with openwgt? It&#039;s outdated and no longer maintained. It&#039;s very bare bones, you have to configure vlans, routing, dhcp ... all by yourself.<br />Flashing the orginal netgear firmware is not any better, either.<br />I once had one wgt634u running openwgt, but I migrated it to openwrt a long time ago.<br />You can use the current kamikaze release, flash it from within CFE, see instructions at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT634U#head-13b1b97872eca588bb023b1260630188c3f71427">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ 88c3f71427</a></p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for the reply. the only reason that i wanted to flash it to original is to put it in an stable status for not.<br />i was trying to flash it through CFE and i set up tftp on my machine but the problem is it can not see my machine which is running tftp so i can not get the file from it in order to flash it.<br />this command</p><p>CFE&gt; flash -noheader 192.168.1.3:wgt634u/openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin flash0.os</p><p>that is the problem. i go to the machine the ip address that has been assigned to the machine is not even the range of this ip address and when i use that ip address within CFE it can not even see it.<br />by the way i have a windows machine at this moment.</p><p>what should i do?</p><br /><p>thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blackhole</strong> on 4 Aug 2007, 19:47)</p>

					<p>Hmmm, I never tried running an tftp server on windows ;-)<br />Which software do you use?<br />I use atftpd on my main wgt634u running openwrt to flash another wgt634u :-)</p><p>Does the wgt634u get an IP from your DHCP server with the &quot;ifconfig eth0 -auto&quot; command in CFE?<br />Is the IP correct?<br />If that doesn&#039;t work you can assign an IP manually via the command &quot;ifconfig eth0 -addr=192.168.1.250 -mask=255.255.255.0&quot;<br />I think the CFE has a ping command too, so you can test the connection to your tftp server.<br />The name &quot;wgt634u/openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin&quot; is a relative path to your tftp root on your server, so the file &quot;openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin&quot; resides in a directory named &quot;wgt634u&quot; in your code.<br />Are you sure, this is correct?</p>									</div>
