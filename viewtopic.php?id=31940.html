					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;m new to this forum. Trying to migrate from other router system to OpenWRT. And recently I&#039;ve found one problem. Its about &#039;nth&#039; packet matching rule in iptables. It is not supported. I&#039;ve searched the forums and found only very old topics about this issue. So I thought that is allready supported by default in recent kernel, but that is not true either. I&#039;ve looked at the web page of netfilter and found that its possible to add some extensions, but this do not apply to OpenWRT. Anyway if I apply some extensions then I need to recompile OpenWRT. Is it any possibility to add nth extension without recomplining whole OpenWRT ? Can you suggest something ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alphalt</strong> on 18 Sep 2011, 20:37)</p>

					<p>Ok, maybe my first question was too stupid I don&#039;t know, but zero replies means something.<br />I&#039;ll try second chance. Ok, I will try to rebuild from source the package, but please at least guide me how to apply patch-o-matic for iptables in OpenWRT sources ? I would like to apply and recompile, but as I know applying is through svn and it should update my notebook&#039;s iptables, not OpenWRT source&#039;s. Please guide me a little bit.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not familiar with the nth packet matching option in iptables, but I know OpenWRT has a lot of netfilter extensions that you can select when you build your own firmware image. So, my suggested route would be the following:</p><p>1. Follow <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a> and build your own OpenWRT image<br />2. When running &quot;make menuconfig&quot;, head to the Kernel Modules &gt; Netfilter section and see if what you want is listed in there<br />3. If not, run &quot;make download world&quot; and you should find a new directory called dl/ which contains the iptables sources<br />4. Extract and patch these sources to include what you like<br />5. Build OpenWRT with &quot;make&quot; (or &quot;make V=99&quot; to get debug output)</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for replying. Your post should be helpful I think <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Well, at least it is very good start for me. Most of the points are clear except of patching iptables, but in reality I think I will find out how to do it. If no, I will come back to this topic. Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I have problem. Is is not possible to use patch-o-matic on newest version of iptables, so the only way is xtables-addons which is allready supported on OpenWRT, but they do not support nth matcher. So I do not understand. Is there any people who uses nth matcher on OpenWRT ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;m too outdated guy <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Nth is not a matcher anymore. It was some time ago. Now it is a part (mode) of statistic match. FInally I found correct info <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Too much info on the net <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Now I think problem is solved.</p>									</div>
