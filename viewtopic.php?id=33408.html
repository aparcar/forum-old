					<p>I&#039;ve been testing the Sparclan WUSB-505 V2 WiFi USB stick as a wireless access point with my RouterStation Pro and it&#039;s working great. The connection is very fast and very stable--faster than any other Atheros or Ralink based USB stick I&#039;ve tried and comparable to the mini-pci 11n cards in my RS Pro. It uses the Ralink 28xx USB driver included in Openwrt. It is a 2 transmitter/2 receiver radio. The one issue is that 11a (5GHz) is still unstable when used as an access point, but 11n is rock solid. The oxford tec website shows it in bare metal but mine came with a normal white plastic case.</p><p>You could plug several of these USB wifi sticks into a powered USB hub and run multiple USB based wireless access points.</p><p>Here&#039;s my router&#039;s lsusb output:</p><p>Bus 001 Device 005: ID 148f:3572 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT3572 Wireless Adapter</p><p>RT3572 is an RT3072 with 5GHz dual band added (5GHz is flaky on OpenWrt). It&#039;s basically a combo RT2770 11gn &amp; RT2750 11an radio.</p><p>I bought mine from oxfordtec for $43 + shipping here:<br /><a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/us/sparklan-wubr-505v2-dual-band-wireless-802-11a-b-g-n-draft-2-0-usb-head-ralink-rt2770-2750-2t2r-chipset-for-integrators-only.html">http://www.oxfordtec.com/us/sparklan-wu â€¦ -only.html</a></p><p>It&#039;s listed as an &quot;integrators only&quot; part but they will sell it to individuals.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robrob</strong> on 23 Dec 2011, 00:20)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t use any of WiFi connection, yet. However, if you had to do something different to get your Sparclan WUSB-505 V2 WiFi USB stick to work properly on OpenWRT, I am sure readers here will certainly appreciate if you don&#039;t mind to share how you managed to get this Sparclan WUSB-505 V2 WiFi USB stick working under OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>The only thing required is to select Kernel Modules/Networking/RT28xxUSB in make menuconfig. It will then show up in your wireless config file just like any other wifi radio.</p>									</div>

					<p>Based on robrob&#039;s positive report I decided to order a couple of these adapters from Oxfordtec.&nbsp; After I finalized the order they informed me that &quot;Unfortunately, the WUBR-505Nv2 is a project only part at present and we have no samples in stock.&quot;&nbsp; They suggested a replacement, the WUBR-507N, and said this should work well with OpenWRT (it has a Ralink RT3572 chipset).&nbsp; I agreed to receive these instead.</p><p>However, after testing with backfire r29567 (snapshot on website about 20111220) on a Seagate Dockstar, the 2.4 GHz band Bit Rate was quite poor, but more troubling, in sta mode the adapter constantly connected and disconnected.&nbsp; I am attempting to return the adapters for a refund.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yawlhoo</strong> on 21 Dec 2011, 23:26)</p>

					<p>Sorry to hear that yawlhoo. They do list my USB wifi adapter for &quot;integrators only&quot; but they sold it to me as an individual. I ordered my USB adapter from Oxfordtec several months ago and had to wait patiently for Sparclan to finalize the design and ship. I never tested them in sta mode, just as an access point. I&#039;m running the Attitude Adjustment trunk which I update almost weekly and I&#039;m still very impressed with the radio&#039;s speed and stability in 11ng access point mode.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robrob</strong> on 23 Dec 2011, 00:23)</p>
