					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m considering making the switch from DD-WRT to OpenWRT for a couple of reasons.</p><p>Firstly, SSH is broken in my build of DD-WRT.<br />Secondly, I&#039;m already using opkg, so I figured why not just go the whole way and install OpenWRT?<br />Thirdly, the forum here seems really open and friendly, and I&#039;m keen to learn. It&#039;s not easy to ask questions in the DD-WRT forum!</p><p>I&#039;m using &quot;DD-WRT v24-sp2 (03/25/13) std&quot; on a TP-LINK WDR3600 at the moment.</p><p>Is it possible to flash the factory.bin image from DD-WRT&#039;s &quot;Firmware Upgrade&quot; function on the web GUI?</p><p>Am I right to use the factory.bin and not the sysupgrade.bin?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Feathers</p>									</div>

However, I decided to take the plunge and just use the DD-WRT GUI to flash OpenWRT firmware onto my Linksys WRT54GS v3.1 and it worked without a problem. Of course, every router is different. So, this may and/or may not work on other routers. For me, if it didn&#039;t work, I would just pull out my LaFonera FON2100 device and use its serial/console to de-brick my router.</p><p>BTW, I strongly recommend that you read the Doc/Wiki pages. There are tons of information that you won&#039;t find them on DD-WRT. Also, try to avail yourself to start learning on how to compile OpenWRT firmware from scratch. The later will steer you to learn more about OpenWRT. Who knows you will become one of OpenWRT contributors in the near future to add more platforms and/or packages. Good luck.</p>									</div>

Unlike OpenWRT, DD-WRT doesn&#039;t include a capability to build toolchains, IIRC. In order to build any DD-WRT firmware with its buildroot, one first needs to download and/or install a binary toolchains and/or SDK for that platform. IIRC, it was a pain-in-the-a$$ trying to get DD-WRT buildroot to build a firmware.</p>									</div>

Also, I believe some people here have ported OpenWRT to other platforms (including platforms un/supported by DD-WRT non open source), but don&#039;t want to submit to OpenWRT for a review to add as an OpenWRT supported platform. If you had those devices, you sure can contact those people and pay them to support your device to run on OpenWRT firmware. Does that mean OpenWRT has a support for that device?

					<p>Just FYI, I also switched from DD-WRT to openwrt on my linksys WRT54G v2.2.</p><p>I also started with reverting to the default firmware from linksys (<a href="http://downloads.linksys.com/downloads/firmware/1224638367382/FW_WRT54Gv4_4.21.5.000_20120220.bin">http://downloads.linksys.com/downloads/ … 120220.bin</a>) following the instructions from <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT54G_v2.2.">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Li … T54G_v2.2.</a></p><p>Flashing the openwrt firmware using the stock interface was a breeze.</p>									</div>

					<p>Once again DD-WRT forum Mods turned crazy!</p><p>This week-end as very often i answered some question in DD-WRT forum. </p><p>Initaily i don&#039;t know why but Murrkf one of the mods team most donkey guy, follow every post i made and try to argue with me systematicly.</p><p>this argue reach its top on thread wher subject was, &quot;2,4 or 5 ghz?&quot;.</p><p>I resume my point of view (including removed posts):</p><p>There is no big deal in choicing between 2,4 and 5ghz for small indoor network, 5 ghz will be less bother by element closed to line of site, both will be blocked by material place on line of site. Sure if you compare two network with same tx and antenna gain, 2,4 ghz have better range than 5ghz.</p><p>the argue start with Murrkf comment that says i&#039;m &quot;Full of shit&quot; &quot;Don&#039;t know a penny what i&#039;m talking about&quot; and &quot;5ghz have better range than 2,4 ghz&quot; &quot;5ghz pentrate material like Laser&quot;. As all of this was Insane at me i ask for appologies and mentionned it was exactly the opposed. Then murrkf remove the &quot;Full of shit&quot; correct &quot;5ghz have better range than 2,4 ghz&quot; for &quot;2,4ghz have better range than 5 ghz&quot;...but leave the comment about my skill, then removed all my reply (it is good to be mods sometime! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ).</p><p>then a another donkey joined the dance, and just told me after a week-end spent to fight against this defacing campain that their strike back is due to this openwrt thread and my comment. I&#039;m not sure what i posted here about DD-WRT was enough to declare War at me...</p><p>This give me the key to reply! Reply in this OpenWrt thread where the subject is move from DD-WRT to Openwrt and where DD-WRT mods defacing campain will not affect.</p><p>1°) Yes OpenWRT Forum Smell Roses and DD-WRT forum Smell shit more and more<br />2°) Unfortunatly DD-WRT did not improve its Facing with its Forum, i&#039;m not the first one who become a target of crazzy dogs of DD-WRT forum mods team, and probably not the last.<br />3°) DD-WRT Forum is a curious place where some &quot;Nolife&quot; guys turn their insignifiant poor existance into something facing more important.<br />4°) Murrkf, Lom and some others, are kind of administrative guys who dream of the kind of world described in Georges Orwell best seller &quot;1984&quot;. They found such a place with DD-WRT forum. </p><p>Lom said I claim to be a &quot;Wisp that built thousand of network&quot;...This is true but i don&#039;t claim! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I will not share the exact number, but there is a lot of wireless networks over the world sold as white label that could be sign-up Yzy-oui-fi, Any way i&#039;m not here to make a sort of better ranking for me, so i will not share anymore about this point.</p><p>One thing is sure there is a Cancer in DD-WRT forum (I said forum, because i have nothing against their project or dev team). DD-WRT Forum is probably the best economical DD-WRT&#039;s weapon. but this weapon is less powerfull now, many users are fed up being flame by dummy who mods it, they leave the boat more and more. Do you know that French section of their forum is closed since december 2012, because Boobix the french mod, one of my friend leave the boat....Crazy isn&#039;t it? </p><p>Some one here spoke about Sveasoft old story...here is another interesting thing.</p><p>You probably heard about Firmware Mod Kit? Do you know that DD-WRT banned it&#039;s dev? and now they share FMK how to because none is able to use their buildroot....</p><p>All this smell shit! And I&#039;m so happy to have OpenWRT project to support my business...You couldn&#039;t imagine!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yzy-oui-fi</strong> on 28 Oct 2013, 11:08)</p>

					<p>Thank you yzy-oui-fi.<br />It was nice reading your post while drinkin&#039; the morning coffee. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>I&#039;ve been watching the DD-Wrt forum from times to times.<br />I asked for help once when I was a complete noob in the Wrt stuff, and didn&#039;t get it. But that doesn&#039;t bother me so much.</p><p>What bothers me is a kind of &quot;blasé mod attitude&quot; towards users.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>yzy-oui-fi wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>1°) Yes OpenWRT Forum Smell Roses and DD-WRT forum Smell shit more and more</p></blockquote></div><p>Agreed.</p><p>Here, there are no mods.<br />Mods are the devs.<br />And the forum works just fine.
