					<p>So I am having a strange issue, I am able to connect to my website internally but I am unable to connect to it from the external network (over the Internet).&nbsp; My website runs just fine when I access it internally (192.168.1.1:81) or when I access it over my VPN (openVPN installed on router).

I feel so stupid. Would if work if i configure dns or edit the routers host file to direct traffic going to 192.168.1.1 to website.com</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>plivin89</strong> on 19 Nov 2017, 04:16)</p>

					<p>Actually exactly the other way around.</p><p>Firstly, If you already installed WordPress, it configured itself to the address it has been installed on and will always want to redirect to that address. If that was <a href="http://192.168.1.1/">http://192.168.1.1/</a> it is now configured to that. You can edit the values in the wp_options database table or <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WP_SITEURL">edit wp-config.php and set WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME</a> to reflect your new URL.</p><p>... which should be an URL that is reachable from the internet pointing to your router, i.e. <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> or some ddns service. You can then edit your router&#039;s DNS to translate <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> to 192.168.1.1 so internal requests will not try to go outside of your network. (WordPress does not care about the HTTP host it was accessed with, not what IP that HTTP host translates to.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 19 Nov 2017, 10:50)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your response, I solved the issue by replacing 192.168.1.1 with my public ip address That seem to have solved the issue</p>									</div>
