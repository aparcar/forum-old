					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I was going to mount and use an external storage to set up a small http server for &#039;owncloud&#039;.<br />There is something that came to mind, though:<br />If I install lighttpd along with php and all other required modules (except for kernel modules, I&#039;ll install those on my device (WR1043ND)) on the external storage and I remove that storage later...will the router itself still work as usual? Or will the missing modules cause it to break?</p><br /><p>Another question:<br />Is there any way to find out what &quot;base&quot; packages my device uses?</p>									</div>
