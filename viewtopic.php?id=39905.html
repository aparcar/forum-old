					<p>Installed 12.09 beta on a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v1.8 earlier today. I can access LuCI as well as SSH, but I can&#039;t access the internet. Every request in Firefox results in a &quot;Server not found&quot; error. Windows Network Diagnostics says &quot;The DNS server may be experiencing problems.&quot; In LuCI, under Network -&gt; Diagnostics, clicking on the ping and traceroute buttons gives me this error:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ping: bad address &#039;openwrt.org&#039;</p><p>and this error on nslookup:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Server:&nbsp; &nbsp; 127.0.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Address 1: 127.0.0.1 localhost</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; nslookup: can&#039;t resolve &#039;openwrt.org&#039;: Name or service not known</p><p>Sounds like I need to set up some DNS servers, right?</p><p>So, in LuCI, I go to Network -&gt; Interfaces, click on the Edit button next to LAN, add two DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), click on the &quot;Save &amp; Apply&quot; button, and try it again. Same problem.</p><p>Next, I try doing the same thing to the WAN interface. Hold on a minute - this one is configured as a DHCP client, whereas the LAN is setup as a static address. Shouldn&#039;t my WAN should be setup as a DHCP client? Afterall, I have a dynamic IP address from my ISP. Makes sense, right? Let&#039;s try it...</p><p>Oops, I bricked my router! I had to telnet into it and issue the firstboot command to get it back to defaults.</p><p>I tried configuring the DNS servers via the Windows utility but no luck there either.</p><p>After reading <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection">this page on the wiki</a> a few times, I realized that I might fall under the DOCSIS category. I definitely don&#039;t have DSL. My modem is supplied by my ISP, which connects to my router with an ethernet cable. So I tried following the link to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/access.modem.through.nat">this article</a>, thinking I just need to tell my router how to connect to my modem. I&#039;d like to do this in LuCI, but I don&#039;t have any &quot;IP Aliases&quot; section under my WAN. Am I on the right track, or should I be following the setups under &quot;via plain Ethernet?&quot; I don&#039;t have anything crazy regarding my network setup. It&#039;s just &quot;plain Ethernet,&quot; right?</p><p>Needless to say, I&#039;m extremely nervous about changing any other settings unless I know exactly what they do. In the meantime, I have no internet access through the router. Maybe it was silly of me to presume I would have basic internet connectivity after flashing.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidkennedy85</strong> on 14 Oct 2012, 08:24)</p>

					<p>The reset to the OpenWrt defaults was probably not neccessery. You have cable Internet with a cable modem and your OpenWrt router was connected via the WAN port to a LAN port on the cable modem? The cable modem providing DHCP, right?</p><p>If yes, just a normal power cycle of the cable modem would have fixed your issues then :-)</p><p>In case your DOCSIS cable modem and OpenWrt router using the subnet you just have to change the subnet range in the OpenWrt routers network config and power cycle the cable modem again.</p><p>No magic at all :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>written_direcon</strong> on 14 Oct 2012, 12:50)</p>

					<p>So tell me if I understand this correctly: I had to reset the modem because it had already assigned an IP address to my old router. It didn&#039;t know to assign an IP address to my new router until I reset it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidkennedy85</strong> on 22 Oct 2012, 22:34)</p>
