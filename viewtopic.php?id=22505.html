					<p>I would like to use the UCI configuration file /etc/config/firewall on Kamikaze 7.09 to accomplish the following firewall objective:</p><p>Block all outbound SMTP traffic from LAN hosts 192.168.10.xxx), except that of mail server 192.168.10.5.</p><p>The intent is to prevent malware-infected windows hosts on the LAN from sending spam without going through the mailserver.</p><p>I have added the following lines to /etc/config/firewall:</p><p>accept:dport=25 src=192.168.10.5<br />reject:dport=25</p><p>Are there any better ways of implementing this?</p><p>Is there a UCI syntax for using a -j LOG rule so I can identify LAN hosts which are attempting to use port 25?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
