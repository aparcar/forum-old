					<p>I&#039;ve had openwrt on my WRT54GL for about a week and loved the performance gained using torrents and general usage.&nbsp; Today I decided to try to play some COD4 on my 360, and I&#039;m having issues.&nbsp; I&#039;ve forwarded the ports to my static ip&#039;d 360, and I even get a Open NAT during the network test.&nbsp; However, when I jump on multiplayer my connect to xbox live just drops 3-5minutes in every single time.&nbsp; Researching a little I saw I might need Miniupnp so I installed and enabled this, but still no luck.</p><p>Does anyone have any advice or the answer to getting a 360 properly communicating on openwrt?</p>									</div>
