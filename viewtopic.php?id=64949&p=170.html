					<p>Just FYI</p><p>Do not know the cause but r5422 caused disconnects in my ISP connection and the ISP&#039;s DSLAM shut my VDSL2 line (DSL port) off after a while. It took a few days as the DSLAM sees the disconnects as a bad line and tries to compensate. At least this was how it was explained to me by the ISP help-desk.</p><p>I had to call the ISP and they had to reset the VDSL2 connection (port on DSLAM) I have at the DSLAM. Has been OK since I reverted to prior version and the DSLAM reset was done.</p><p>This happened about a year ago also on other OpenWRT build so I suppose it has something to do with the PPPoE module. Really just a guess. I waited for the next revision and it was OK until this last incident recently.</p><p>I reverted back to davidc502&#039;s r5389 version and all seems fine for the last week.</p><p>This may be unique to me as I use a Netgear DM200 DSL Modem as a dumb DSL bridge with the WRT3200ACM doing all the PPPoE login etc..</p><p>Just wanted to let the community know in case someone else has the same experience.</p>									</div>
