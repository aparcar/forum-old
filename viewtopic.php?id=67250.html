					<p>hello there im new and ive got some questions about uboot and tftp...</p><p>my status is:</p><p>1. the flash is complete deleted<br />2. i put the u-boot.asc into the ram via serial connection (uart mode) and it boots up<br />3. my tftp-server runs at my laptop and works<br />3.1. i can connect to my laptop (tftp) and start &quot;downloading&quot; u-boot.bin, but after 2% or sometimes more<br />i get some timeouts and other errors. (checksum bad; length bad)</p><p>if you need more informations, just ask about it.</p><p>thx in advance<br />steven</p><p>EDIT: The problem is partitially solved - Here&#039;s how I did it:</p><p>A) Had to compile UBoot with CONFIG_HTTPD commented<br />B) Compiled an arv7525pw compatible image with the 15.05 ImageBuilder... when not including LUCI packages it fits the NOR flash just fine.</p><p>download: h t t p s : / / ufile.io/f6110</p><p>-&gt; Boot uboot.asc via HTerm (send over the ascii file via serial)<br />-&gt; Serve uboot-bootstrap.bin and respective image via TFTP<br />-&gt; Exec following commands in uboot-prompt<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>run update_uboot
run update_openwrt</code></pre></div><p>Note: you might have to unprotect the flash manually for the uboot update to succeed. Dont forget to re-protect it!</p><p><strong>Now here&#039;s the deal:</strong> As the flash was completely blank before attempting this recovery procedure.. I am missing the Boot configuration / matching RT2680 eeprom data for this router / chipset.</p><p><strong>Would somebody be so kind and provide a full-dump of this router-model</strong>? It won&#039;t be hooked to the internet really, it&#039;s just ment for in-house repeating. Also the mac will be changed ASAP, no need to worry.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>derenthoser</strong> on 9 Sep 2016, 18:13)</p>
