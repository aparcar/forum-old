But, when i telnet to it, i have following output:</p><p>telnet 192.168.1.1<br />Trying 192.168.1.1...<br />Connected to 192.168.1.1.<br />Escape character is &#039;^]&#039;.</p><p>So, i don&#039;t see busybox ash. can anybody please tell me what is the problem. i tried to reflash through tftp, but it seems boot_wait is not set. bootloader just load bad firmware that i installed. however, i have set boot_time/wait (i dont remember exactly).&nbsp; when i switch to failsafe mode and ping and i have TTL=64 , and tried to tftp origional firmware but in vain.</p><p>Any good tips to recover from it please?</p>									</div>
