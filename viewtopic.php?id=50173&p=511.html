					<p>@doITright</p><p>In the 20 years I&#039;m using Linux only a few projects managed to get on my do not use list. For lede the nail in the coffin was the project announcement to openwrt-devel and the follow up smoke grenade. I was disgusted. The huge discrepancy between what was said and what happens doesn&#039;t help things either. Sure, I could go into details but this is not the place for it. So lets just say out of principle, for political reasons.</p>									</div>
