					<p>After I seemingly bricked my TP-LINK with the V3 firmware (freezing during wireless settings) I managed after some hours of trying (always took the wrong baud-rate) to get the serial console working at 115200.<br />Sadly i just get the output and can&#039;t send commands.<br />I can enter the &quot;failsafe&quot; mode with the QSS-Button but due to the eth0-Bug (setting the wrong ethernet device what makes lan-connections impossible) I can&#039;t send anything neither via telnet nor via uart.<br />I triple-checked the solderings and anything seems fine. Tried multiple Com-Uart-Bridges which worked before (in both ways) without any success.<br />I even tried minicom in Ubuntu (usually Putty in Win7) but nothing helps!<br />Can anyone offer me a hint or at least confirm this problem?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>The bridge over R510 made a connection between RX and GND.

					<p>The only continuity is to R355 (installed) and R510 (missing - connects to GND). I traced the conductor and it disappears somewhere under the AR9132. There seems to be not direct connection from RX to any other missing or installed component on neither side of the PCB. <br />I decided to stop iterative disimprovement and wait for the ordered USB-UART Dongle to avoid any misinterpretations caused by my USB (imax charger usb adaptor) and RS232 (diy nokia cable) interfaces.<br />However, can anyone tell me the value of R510? The board itself has a resistance of 2.45k across it so it should be less than that.<br />Edit: 10k to vcc on the board didn&#039;t help either.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>c4t0r</strong> on 10 Apr 2013, 09:16)</p>

					<p>Got my shipment from HK and... IT WORKS!<br />I just needed to connect vcc (+3.3V from the router) with RX via a 10k resistor.<br />Now I just need to figure out how to factory reset without having to hassle with the eth0-bug.<br />But this is another story to be told.<br />Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>
