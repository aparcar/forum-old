					<p>Just some feedback... I read the &quot;flash layout&quot; and the sysupgrade wiki page, and felt comfortable to upgrade to the 10.03.1-RC5-testing from the snapshots folder too. I have done it using the sysupgrade command from console, and it has been working fine since yesterday.<br/>Nice web front-end rework, and no bugs found for what I use it.</p><p>Since sysupgrade kept my previous /etc/banner, I had to copy the one from /rom/etc/banner.</p><p>Also, for opkg to work properly, since it is not a &quot;final&quot; RC5 release, I had to modify the first line of /etc/opkg.conf file to:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>src/gz packages http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/backfire/10.03.1-RC5-testing/ar71xx/packages</code></pre></div><p>Cool!
