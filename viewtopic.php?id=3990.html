					<p>Hi there,<br />I got a little problem with my WGT634U,<br />I know it hasn&#039;t to do anything with your project,<br />but I would be really glad, if you would help me wheter it isn&#039;t,<br />because i think the procedure to recover the thing would be nearly the same.<br />so, ok, now to the problem:<br />Yesterday I got OpenWGT, because I wanted to set up a little webserver for my website on the router.<br />But after a while, I didn&#039;t got IPKG running with your tracker,<br />sayin&#039; it wouldn&#039;t answer.<br />So I changed the address, seeing that it was wrong.<br />But it didn&#039;t helped, so i decided to restore my WGT634U with the restore script again,<br />which went perfectly.</p><p>But after a while, a friend of mine, which uses OpenWrt since some weeks, gave me his addresses of your<br />package system, and so i decided to get openwgt on the router again.</p><p>But while patching online through the webfronted of netgear, household lost power and so,<br />after a restart of my pc i saw that the router was really... yeah you can imagine.</p><p>I shut it down again and tried to see what happens:<br />The power led is getting green right after connection power, and wlan is only flashing in kind of 3 seconds rhytm.<br />I couldn&#039;t connect to 192.168.1.1 or the other ip adresses of the thingy, wheter with http, ssh or telnet.<br />(wlan isn&#039;t online also...)</p><p>nuthin.<br />Reset Button doesn&#039;t work anymore.<br />Serial Connection didn&#039;t worked, there only crap came out like &quot;OdZzkglFIFfdoeEPkrrpjgggojgogepoojaioajorjrhfkfk&quot; nuthin really.<br />After a while this didn&#039;t worked also not....<br />I&#039;m really having the terrible idea that it is dead now.</p><p>Could anyone give me an idea what to do?<br />Any way to recover?!<br />Please I would be open for ANY suggestion!</p><p>DeusExMachina</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>The fact you get garbage is quite encouraging. I would as a first step check that your terminal settings are correct.</p><p>They should be 115200 baud, 8 bits no parity, and 1 stop bit. Try with no hardware flow control, and with and without software flow control. (I don&#039;t think I use software flow control).</p><p>This should bring up the CFE bootloader, if it does you can follow the instructions here: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WGT634U">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ar/WGT634U</a></p><p>In future, never use the web interface for upgrading, use tftp or serial console triggered updates.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>
