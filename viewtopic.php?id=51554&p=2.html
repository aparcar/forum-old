					<p>Given that the TFTP recovery is provided by TP-Link, the firmware they put out for download should work for this, whether or not it includes a uboot. Perhaps you should contact their support for help with TFTP? Or just buy a serial cable off ebay - they&#039;re pretty cheap.</p>									</div>
