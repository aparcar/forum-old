					<p>Hello everyone! I decided to start this thread on the seldom<br />discussed STARBRIDGE LYNX-110/220 ROUTER/MODEMS.<br />I can&#039;t find anywhere else that people are talking about them<br />and I&#039;ve made some discoveries so hey, why not?</p><p>I&#039;d love to see OPENWRT on this device.<br />I assume it can be done. It&#039;s been done on similar devices.</p><p>My girlfriend lives in a small town with fairly crappy DSL.<br />One day I decided to see if I could access her router/modem<br />as her speeds were terrible. She has a STARBRIDGE LYNX-220.<br />I was able to telnet into the device easilly with the usual<br />methods. I have a client in that same town who upgraded to<br />CABLE internet and had no use for her DSL router/modem so<br />she gave it to me, it&#039;s a STARBRIDGE LYNX-210. I have taken<br />the 210 home and put it onto my LAN as another embedded<br />busybox device that can be accessed via http or telnet.<br />I have also taken it apart and logged what I found.<br />I have not taken the 220 apart but I assume it&#039;s very similar.<br />So... Without further ado... Here is the start!!!</p><p>STARBRIDGE LYNX 210 ROUTER/MODEM<br />--------------------------------<br />This device is an Texas Instruments AR7 based DSL router/modem.</p><p>It can be accessed via telnet or http by going to 192.168.1.1<br />after setting your LAN to 192.168.1.X of course.<br />(X being anything other than 1.)</p><p>Strangely, the default logins from web and telnet are different.</p><p>TELNET<br />------<br />Login: root<br />Password: admin</p><p>HTTP<br />----<br />Login: admin<br />Password: admin</p><p>I&#039;m pretty sure I found a backup of the firmware, it&#039;s located<br />at /usr/lib/modules and named &quot;ar0700xx.bin&quot;.</p><p>You can enable web access to the entire filesystem and download<br />anything you want, including the firmware, with this from shell:</p><p># thttpd -d / -p 81 -D</p><p>After that, go to 192.168.1.1:81 and you&#039;re in!<br />Hit CTRL+C to break the process or just put an &amp; after it to<br />throw it into the background when you first type it.</p><p>It&#039;s easy to get the router into a state that needs resetting.<br />If you crash it by simply causing a core dump or something<br />from shell it often enters into a strange state where you can<br />telnet to it and get to the login, but nothing works.<br />In this state, you can&#039;t use http at all and the only thing I<br />have found to do is use a paperclip or similar object to hit<br />the reset button on the back.</p><p>TECHNICAL SPECS:</p><p>The device uses a TNETD7300AGDW CPU which is a version of<br />Texas Instrument&#039;s AR7. The WIKI listed below gives some very<br />usefull information and links about the AR7 plus links to<br />various devices that use it. Many of these devices have OPENWRT<br />on them so I assume the 210/220 should be easy to do!!!</p><p><a href="http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/AR7">http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/AR7</a></p><p>You can get a datasheet on the cpu from here:</p><p><a href="http://focus.ti.com.cn/pdfs/bcg/ar7wi_fact_sheet.pdf">http://focus.ti.com.cn/pdfs/bcg/ar7wi_fact_sheet.pdf</a></p><p>It&#039;s a very cool CPU! I am wondering if it is possible, after<br />hacked, to turn the device into a VOIP box where it can grab<br />the net through it&#039;s ethernet port and put the voip out it&#039;s<br />analog DSL port to a phone. This *should* be possible in my<br />opinion, anyone in the know please give your thoughts!</p><p>Under the hood you will find:</p><p>TNETD7300AGDW CPU with alpha numeric 5C2CJ49 on it.</p><p>Linkcom LAN 1102 0550</p><p>Sticker on the board reading T488 11 P31A42</p><p>Small chip (controller chip?)</p><p>UTC SKA1 MC34063AL ND</p><p>Chip with sticker on it that lettering/numbering was rubbed<br />off of. 2 red dots on chip also. Here is all I could get:</p><p>INTEL C&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;F1 60<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (M) (C) &#039;02</p><p>The sticker says: 62.48.3 P31 C 21</p><p>Another chip:</p><p>ISSI<br />FOUND INFO ON THIS! THIS IS THE RAM!<br />---&gt; IS42S16400B-7T &lt;---- THIS IS IT!<br />G2583500N 0521</p><p>Here&#039;s a link to the datesheet:<br /><a href="http://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/98567/ETC/IS42S16400B-7T.html">http://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-p â€¦ 0B-7T.html</a></p><p>It&#039;s 64 Megabits Synchronous DRAM</p><p>Sticker on back of board:<br />MAC: (My MAC ID)<br />DSL 600EU</p><p>Logo on back of board:<br />B(Looks like Devil&#039;s tail)RB M103D<br />94V-0 2405</p><p>Another thing on the board:<br />050-533000-401 G</p><p>I know I&#039;m being overly descriptive but any information may<br />help so I&#039;m doing this in hopes that someone in the know may<br />understand if firmware from another device may work in this.</p><p>STARBRIDGE LYNX 220 ROUTER/MODEM<br />--------------------------------<br />I am not positive but I assume all that applies to the 210 is<br />true with the 220 as well. Verification of this coming soon!</p><p>I hope that something can/will come of this thread and that<br />at the very least it will become the one place people who have<br />these devices can talk at. Thanks!!!</p><p>- Dieter</p><p><a href="http://WWW.MENTALDOMINANCE.COM">WWW.MENTALDOMINANCE.COM</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MENTALDOMINANCE</strong> on 2 Apr 2009, 09:59)</p>

					<p>AMMENDMENT:<br />I have done extensive research on the LYNX-210/220 and have discovered that they&#039;re the AZTECH DSL-600 series!</p><p>LYNX-210 = AZTECH DSL600EU<br />LYNX-220 = AZTECH DSL600E</p><p>There&#039;s a ton of other stuff I&#039;ve recently discovered. Don&#039;t worry about playing either! If you brick the<br />router, the awesome TNET D7300AGDW CPU has an ADAM2 bootloader built into it!<br />Essentially this means that via FTP, you can access what you&#039;d normally need a JTAG or TTL device to do!<br />I&#039;ve already done it many times. Below is a very cool app to use. It lets you do all sorts of stuff such as<br />rebuild/edit/delete/resize the MTD partitions on the ADAM2 and more! This app is designed to interface<br />with AR7 processors via ADAM2 so anything else you have that fits that description will work with it also.</p><p><a href="http://ciclamab.altervista.org/index_en.php">http://ciclamab.altervista.org/index_en.php</a></p><p>CAUTION: The MTD2 partition IS THE ADAM2 BOOTLOADER so whatever you do do not fuck with it!!!</p><p>You can get firmware for all of this stuff here:</p><p><a href="ftp://ftp.aztech.com/SUPPORT">ftp.aztech.com/SUPPORT</a><br /><a href="ftp://ftp.aztech.com/SHIRO">ftp.aztech.com/SHIRO</a></p><p>If you go into just <a href="ftp://ftp.aztech.com">ftp.aztech.com</a> it appears as if nothing is there because all directories are hidden.<br />So far I have only found SUPPORT and SHIRO. SHIRO is some Singapore company that makes<br />devices like MP3 players and the lot. There are a ton of cool firmwares and shit in there, this is<br />a nice place to find a bunch of shit so go check it out!</p><p>I will post more on my work if anyone seems at all interested. I am currently working on interchanging<br />firmwares from 600E, EU, ER, EW, etc. for different functionality. They are all basically the same thing<br />except EW = Wireless, ER = Router, etc. but you should be able to put the software from any on the other.<br />This will give examples of how to access devices you may want to add to the hardware it&#039;s self or if you&#039;re<br />like me and you want to turn a LYNX-210/220 into a router with a hub/switch. My ultimate goal would be to<br />turn the device into a VOIP box or get OPENWRT onto it. We&#039;ll see. I haven&#039;t checked fully on OPENWRT yet,<br />been too busy with the other exciting progress I&#039;ve been making but I have come across a forum on here<br />dealing with OPENWRT on the 600E. <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2820">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=2820</a><br />Remember, your LYNX-210 is just a renamed AZTECH DSL-600EU and the LYNX-220 is a renamed<br />AZTECH DSL-600E. With this information in hand, you should be able to accomplish a lot as there is<br />documentation and hacking going on with the DSL-600 series.</p><p>Happy hacking!!!</p><p>- Dieter</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MENTALDOMINANCE</strong> on 3 Apr 2009, 00:25)</p>

					<p>mazilo: Thanks for the compliment! I don&#039;t really know the answer to your question though, it&#039;s been a while<br />since I&#039;ve played with the LYNX.</p><p>rseiler: Is it worth taking the risk? I don&#039;t really consider it a risk, as I said, it would be near impossible<br />to brick the device due to it&#039;s ADAM2. Nevertheless, &quot;if it ain&#039;t broken don&#039;t fix it&quot; is a rule to follow unless you&#039;re<br />like me and you have to hack everything you own. 8) I have moved on to other things since conquering the<br />LYNX so it isn&#039;t really fresh in my mind anymore. I don&#039;t know about the system clock, I assume you&#039;ve tried<br />using the TIME and DATE commands, right? I don&#039;t recall if the version I &quot;upgraded&quot; to was higher or lower.<br />At the time I was more concerned with just proving the concept that the modem can be converted into a<br />DSL600XX from the LYNX. 8) Remember, this isn&#039;t a firmware upgrade per se - it&#039;s a device switch.<br />After doing this, you no longer have a LYNX-210 - you have a DSL600EU. The LYNX seems to be a noname<br />company that has no support for it&#039;s devices - the DSL on the other hand has many firmwares and seems not<br />only to be supported but to be the hardware the LYNX is based on. I had a free LYNX to play with that a client<br />had given me. If you are going to try the hack all I can say is make sure you know all the settings to get<br />your modem online once converted and make sure you dump the LYNX firmware so you can go back if needed.<br />(I don&#039;t remember how exactly, again this isn&#039;t fresh in my mind anymore. Sorry.)</p><p>- Dieter</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MENTALDOMINANCE</strong> on 28 Apr 2009, 22:53)</p>
