					<p>Hello<br />I am goint to join your struggle here. I have pqi air card with terminal up and running. Cross compiler on the way. Hello world from forum worked. So my setup is almost ready.<br />As I didn&#039;t see any power consumption results here I will share mine(measured at 3.3V).</p><p>25mA – uSD card standby(not sure about that)<br />57mA – booting<br />110mA – WiFi enabled<br />125mA – downloading large file (transfer up to 800KB/s through http)</p><p>From functional point of view it looks like keyasic chip has builtin sdio swich between host and cpu with ability to monitor transactions between host and sd card. My card has interesting feature: It has three dedicated jpg files which after deletion turn on wifi AP; connect to AP(not tested); perform factory reset. So it seems like there already is wifi client mode. SoC reacts immediately for file deletion so there must be some irq mechanism to do that. Pooling method would have some delay. Maybe that is why card doesn&#039;t boot standalone. Maybe it waits for specific sdio command.<br />Log on file deletion</p><p>File1:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>starting pid 94, tty &#039;/dev/ttyS0&#039;: &#039;-/bin/ash &#039;

					<p>Today I tried to connect my PQI to STM32F4 over 4bit SDIO. Here are conclusions:</p><p>STM32F4Cube libraries are total shit(at least under gcc). For example higher capacity cards overflow 32bit value breaking card capacity readout. Simple casting to 64bit value fixes the problem. Another (couple hours of debugging) has shown that STM library, although it is configurable for 4 bit mode, will never work in 4 bit mode in the form as it was written(no matter what compiler). It changes uC interface into 4 bit mode without turning sd card into 4 bit mode(ACMD6) resultin in start bit error during status register readout.</p><p>Aside from STM. </p><p>PQI card introduces half clock cycle delay on cmd stream! I tested three uSD cards and one SD card. They all change state at cmd output on falling clock edge. However with PQI card cmd changes state on rising edge! I did not check wheather same thing happens on data lines because card doesn&#039;t initialize(probably due to clock edge mismatch).</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok i finally got it working. Another wired this about pqi is that it sometimes blocks response from sd card(CMD55). uSD card was inside PQI card and did respond(seen on scope) but the PQI did not forward the response to host. As a workaround I added retry loop on cmd 55 and it fixed the problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>modimo</strong> on 10 Nov 2014, 17:16)</p>

					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I need some help. I have a 32gb Transcend Wifi Card and all the extra function I want it wireless upload of mp3 files from my PC to my MP3 player. Here is the problem. I start an ftp server via autorun.sh and also telnet client. All is fine. I can upload files and can see them from telnet or web config of Transcend. After powering off and on the MP3 player, it can detect new files (increase file count) but can&#039;t play those files. I also tried sync command, remount of sd, same thing.</p><p>I take out the SD and put in my PC, I can play uploaded files. I tried comparing files written by SD reader and FTP, everything (owner, permissions etc) except the timestamp is same. (This might be misleading since /mnt/sd is FAT32 and permission dont work?) I tried correcting the date by date -s command, no difference.&nbsp; </p><p>What might be the difference of files written by the SD Reader and FTP Server? I also tried the cp command of a playable file, but copy is not playable. only mv command works (which is nothing but the original playable file of course) So any file created by root user/telnet/ftp etc is unplayable on the MP3 player. </p><p>How can I fool the MP3 player that files created by FTP are like created when plugged into a PC? I would very much appreciate any help I can get on this. I tried 1.6 and 1.8 Transcend Firmwares, my autorun.sh is as follows:<br />cp /www/sd/busybox-armv5l /sbin/busybox-extra<br />chmod a+x /sbin/busybox-extra<br />/sbin/busybox-extra telnetd -l /bin/bash &amp;<br />/sbin/busybox-extra tcpsvd -vE 0.0.0.0 21 ftpd -w /www/sd &amp;</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I solved my problem, it turns out that telnet client starts to write to SD card close to end and my MP3 player although seems to support 32gb card it actually can&#039;t address files close to end. </p><p>So I repartitioned the Transcend card as 4gb + 28gb and mounting the second partition as sd-ext. Good thing is that, a second FTP server on port 22 can access it just right. </p><p>Now, would it be possible to put minidlna and samba on this card? Any precompiled binaries? Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I just purchased the PQI aircard and I have a few quick questions.&nbsp; I have used the autorun.sh on the flucards before, but I have had no success with the PQI.&nbsp; Could I be doing something wrong or does it not have the autorun.sh configured at the end of its startup?&nbsp; </p><p>Reason I&#039;m asking is that I&#039;d like to have it deleted the connect to hotspot jpg so that it will connect as a client automatically.&nbsp; I plan on having multiple PQI cards running on a single network where I can download from them.&nbsp; I would prefer not to have to change the firmware on multiple cards if I can either put an autorun.sh script or could a program.bin compiled to to the delete work?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure on the load order of when program.bin gets called and maybe someone with experience here could let me know?</p><p>Cheers, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pete</p>									</div>

					<p>But I don&#039;t know what that image suports is the problem, Did you send an email to the developer? I know on mine I can set it to powersave mode and it uses about half the power but I think it only works on the PQI version.&nbsp; IF you are actively pushing images why not just shut off the wifi and only turn on when transmitting? It would take a bit longer to transfer but would save much more power then just setting tx off. On mine even turning off the wifi compleatly only reduces power usage by a few percent (~5%) if not transmitting.</p>									</div>
