					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve just got a quick question. I&#039;ve bridged the TX and RX pins with a wire on serial port ttyS1 and have managed to send data and receive it. The problem though is that the data keeps being received with longer line breaks each time the text is output. I&#039;ve attached a sample output to explain better. Is there some serial buffer or something that I&#039;m not clearing or is it another issue? I&#039;m sorry if this question has been asked already, I didn&#039;t find it in my admittedly brief search. Thank you!</p><p>Sending Terminal<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/dev# echo &quot;hi&quot; &gt; ttyS1</code></pre></div><p>Receiving Terminal<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/dev# cat &lt; ttyS1
