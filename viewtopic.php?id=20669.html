					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;d like to multicast over wireless on a WRT54GL.<br />Sounds simple, but apparently, it is not.<br />Did anyone succeed in this?</p><p>Multicasting between ethernet vlans (e.g. eth0.0 and eth0.1) works by using igmpproxy<br />and a recompiled 2.4 kernel with multicast support. If somebody needs help on this, just <br />drop me an email!</p><p>However, multicasting over the wireless interface does not work. Two choices:</p><p>a. multicast routing over wireless<br />I broke up the bridge and tried to route multicast over wl0 as a downstream interface<br />for igmpproxy, just like e.g. eth0.1. Unfortunately kamikaze freezes when I&nbsp; run igmpproxy<br />so I&#039;d suspect a kernel problem.</p><p>b. multicast bridge over wireless<br />Here I bridge the wl0 interface to the upstream ethernet interface (the multicast source).<br />igmpproxy is not needed then but does not freeze the system if run either. It could still be<br />used to route multicasts to another ethernet interface (e.g. eth0.1).<br />Multicasts are apparently delivered (tcpdump shows multicast udp packets on the bridge and<br />the wl0 interface and the wlan LED is flashing) but the wireless is effectively dead. Almost no<br />packets are received on the client side. If you ping the client, you get 99% packet loss with <br />an avg. RTT of 20 or more seconds. Multicasts packets do not arrive at all.<br />This is not a bandwidth problem because the multicast packets would just need about 1/4<br />of the wireless net rate and traffic shaping does not help either. Therefore, I&#039;m suspecting<br />a kernel (driver?) problem here too.</p><p>Any hints to get this to work are appreciated! Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi hondo20, </p><p>multicast over wireless doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>You can increase default rate (which is 1mbps) and you will get something better <br /># wl mrate X (with X the rate in the basic set rate : 1, 2, .., 11, ...54) </p><p>But it&#039;s still an unreliable stream since there is no ack in multicast.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting. Do you know _why_ multicast over wireless does not work?<br />I cannot see why it should not. After all, it is usually just a stream of udp packets.<br />Bandwidth and reliability (packet loss) are related to any packets, not only to multicast, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, changing the settings of &#039;wl mrate&#039; did not help. Wireless is effectively dead.</p><p>Therefore, is it a limitation of the proprietary broadcom driver for the 2.4 kernel or a bug in the 2.4 kernel elsewhere?</p><p>If so, I could probably wait for the 2.6 kernel/b43 driver to work on the WRT54GL.<br />Otherwise, I&#039;d need to move to a different platform.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any comments helping me in my decision whether to stay with the WRT54GL or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update: multicast can be transmitted over wireless but apparently not received.</p><p>I&#039;ve configured the WRT54GL with kamikaze 8.09.1 (2.4 kernel with multicast support enabled) in AP mode with WPA2 security.<br />Wireless is bridged to an vlan (eth0.0) which is the upstream multicast source.</p><p>So far I&#039;ve tried another WRT54GL with kamikaze too to create a wireless bridge to receive multicasts.</p><p>Now I&#039;ve tried a different wireless client (Linksys WUSB54G v4 under OpenBSD 4.5) and the multicast packets<br />were received without a problem.

					<p>Hi, </p><p>It&#039;s not that multicast doesn&#039;t work at all, it&#039;s that multicast doesn&#039;t work very well because of how it&#039;s design in IEEE802.11.<br />If you look at IEEE802.11 specifications, you can see that there is no ack mechanism in the MAC protocol for multicast. </p><p>- It means that you don&#039;t know if the frame has been received correctly. (in unicast there is an ack mechanism so it&#039;s more reliable)<br />- That means also the contention window keep the minimum size either there is collision or not. And if multicast doesn&#039;t increase its contention window and unicast does, multicast stream will be likely sent first. </p><p>for update2:<br />there is other wl command... try `wl --help&#039; hope it can help you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi kirap! Thanks for you reply!</p><p>Probable packet loss because of the lack of acknowledge packets is not a concern for me. <br />I&#039;d like to multicast an udp packet stream anyways where delivery isn&#039;t guaranteed either.</p><p>The problem is that I do not see any multicast packets _at all_ on the wireless interface (using tcpdump) when<br />I run kamikaze on a WRT54GL as a wireless client (station mode). As if they&#039;re filtered before they&#039;re fed to the kernel.<br />As written in update 1), the multicast packets are delivered over wireless in AP mode because I can receive them<br />with a different client.</p><p>I&#039;ve already checked the &#039;wl -h&#039; output. Nothing obvious. But then I would not have guessed that I had<br />to manually set the mrate parameter. The default value of 0 (auto) did not not work.<br />Therefore, thanks again for that hint, otherwise my AP would not multicast.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just in case someone finds this thread and is curious:<br />I got multicast over wireless working by using an openvpn tunnel.</p><p>Here&#039;s a brief description. If there a more questions, please be sure to also send me a PM!<br />This should work for whiterussian and kamikaze. I&#039;ve used kamikaze 8.09.1.</p><p>The box setup is as follows:<br />IPTV-router &lt;--cable--&gt; WRT54GL (AP) &lt;--wireless--&gt; WRT54GL (STA) &lt;--cable--&gt; IPTV-Settopbox<br />In the end the settopbox should believe it is directly connected to the IPTV-router.</p><p>The steps that got multicasting over wireless working for me:<br />* break up the bridge between lan and wireless, i.e. use routed configuration<br />&nbsp; (directly multicasting over the wireless bridge never worked for me).<br />* create a bridge with only the lan interface connected. Openvpn&#039;s tap interface will be <br />&nbsp; bridged to it. The wireless interface is not connected to a bridge.<br />* setup (preferably encrypted) wireless network between AP and STA.<br />* install openvpn and setup a server on the AP and an openvpn client on the STA (configs follow),<br />&nbsp; both using a tap interface bridged to the lan interface. The multicast packets will be captured<br />&nbsp; there and tunneled over wireless, encapsulated within the openvpn packets.<br />&nbsp; I also tried to use gre tunnels first, but gre interfaces cannot be bridged. That&#039;s why I turned to openvpn.<br />* make sure that both the lan and tap interfaces are set into promiscuous _and_ allmulti mode.</p><p>openvpn server config:</p><p>cd /tmp/openvpn<br />port 1194<br />float<br />proto tcp-server<br />dev tap0<br />up&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/etc/openvpn/scripts/up.sh<br />down-pre /etc/openvpn/scripts/down-pre.sh<br />script-security 3<br />secret /etc/openvpn/secret.key<br />cipher none<br />auth&nbsp; &nbsp;none<br />no-iv<br />no-replay<br />mute-replay-warnings<br />persist-key<br />persist-tun<br />status /tmp/openvpn/status.log 60<br />verb 4<br />mute 5<br />mssfix 1440<br />sndbuf 131072<br />rcvbuf 131072<br />txqueuelen 1000</p><p>openvpn client config:</p><p>cd /tmp/openvpn<br />remote 192.168.1.1:1194<br />remote 192.168.2.1:1194<br />float<br />proto tcp-client<br />dev tap0<br />up&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/etc/openvpn/scripts/up.sh<br />down-pre /etc/openvpn/scripts/down-pre.sh<br />script-security 3<br />secret /etc/openvpn/secret.key<br />cipher none<br />auth&nbsp; &nbsp;none<br />no-iv<br />no-replay<br />mute-replay-warnings<br />persist-key<br />persist-tun<br />status /tmp/openvpn/status.log 60<br />verb 4<br />mute 5<br />mssfix 1440<br />sndbuf 131072<br />rcvbuf 131072<br />txqueuelen 1000</p><p>Notes about the openvon configuration:<br />* The client tries to connect over lan (192.168.1.1) first, then over wireless (192.168.2.1). That way, I can connect the STA to the lan<br />&nbsp; where available, <br />* I&#039;m using a shared secret instead of a PKI with certificates to simplify matters as I only connect a single settopbox.<br />* Using tcp as a transport worked better for me (less hiccups). YMMV, though, so please also try udp transport.<br />* To lighten the CPU load on the WRT54GL, I run openvpn without _any_ encryption and _no_ authentication! Beware!<br />&nbsp; The openvpn tunnel is _only_ used as a transport, so I&#039;d recommend to secure the wireless link with at least WPA or better WPA2. <br />* Two scripts are run when openvpn connection is established (up.sh) and lost (down-pre.sh) to ensure the interfaces have the proper flags set<br />and to add the tap interface to the lan-bridge. The scripts contents (don&#039;t forget to make them executable):</p><p>up.sh:<br />#!/bin/sh<br />/sbin/ifconfig $1 promisc multicast allmulti up<br />/usr/sbin/brctl addif br-lan $1<br />/sbin/ifconfig br-lan multicast allmulti</p><p>pre-down.sh:<br />#!/bin/sh<br />/usr/sbin/brctl delif br-lan $1</p><p>Last but not least, I tuned the tcp stack a little because of the use of the tcp transport.<br />I&#039;ve added this to /etc/sysctl.conf:<br />net.core.rmem_max = 262144<br />net.core.wmem_max = 262144<br />net.core.rmem_default = 131072<br />net.core.wmem_default = 131072<br />net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 16384 131072 262144 <br />net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 16384 131072 262144 <br />net.ipv4.tcp_mem&nbsp; = 16384 131072 262144 <br />net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_frto=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_dsack=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_sack=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_fack=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=1<br />net.ipv4.tcp_westwood=1<br />net.unix.max_dgram_qlen=100</p><p>So, I hope this helps somebody.</p>									</div>

					<p>One more note about igmpproxy: <br />You need it if you want to _route_ multicast and igmp packets. You would then also need to build a custom kernel with<br />kernel options CONFIG_IP_MROUTE, CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V1 and CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V2 enabled.</p><p>This is not required with the setup from comment #10 because here the multicast upstream source (eth0.0 on AP) is _bridged_<br />to the multicast downstream destination (eth0.0 on STA) by the openvpn tunnel. So, no igmp or multicast packets are routed but<br />anything over wireless, such as the openvpn packets, is routed.</p><p>Maybe you&#039;re confusing bridged and routed networking?</p>									</div>

					<p>I did not mention about the firewall or iptables in comment #10 because iptables firewalling is not an issue here.<br />You create a _bridge_ between the lan interfaces on the AP and STA. Therefore, to filter the packets, you&#039;d <br />have to use ebtables to control the packets through the bridge. iptables is for _routed_ traffic only, i.e. you cannot<br />filter the packets through the bridge with iptables. <br />You basically build something like a &quot;split&quot; switch, it&#039;s ethernet ports both on the AP and on the STA.</p><p>Before you try to bridge your wan interface, you should try to create a basic _working_ wireless configuration first.<br />Then break up the bridge lan-wireless. Once that works, you can add openvpn.</p><p>If you simply _bridge_ tap0 to your wan interface, this should not change anything (like NAT, routing or firewalling)<br />because this is all about _routed_ packets. However, you should replace &quot;wan&quot;&nbsp; with &quot;br-wan&quot; in /etc/config/firewall to<br />filter on the bridge itself (Note that eth0.1 of br-wan should not have an IP address assigned, only the bridge br-wan interface).</p><p>But honestly, I do not understand what you&#039;re trying to do.<br />What devices to you want to connect? What is multicast source and what is the destination?</p>									</div>

					<p>To route multicast packets, you need:<br />a) a kernel which is capable of routing them (see comment #19). Recent kamikaze releases should already have this set, I think.<br />b) proper firewall rules. That is basically:<br />* allow forwarding of udp packets to 224.0.0.0/4<br />* allow forwarding of igmp protocol</p><p>However, I&#039;d strongly recommend that you have a look at udpxy (see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23807)">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23807)</a>.<br />It is an multicast proxy (not only igmp), so you need neither igmpproxy, forwarding rules in your firewall nor worry about the kernel.<br />You only need to open your firewall to accept igmp and udp 224/4 locally (INPUT chain).</p><p>udpxy works very fine. Haven&#039;t tried over wireless yet, though.<br />Once launched, say on port 4022, visit http://ip-address:4022/status for a usage template.<br />To use, simply replace a multicast address like udp://239.0.2.67:8202 with http://ip-address:4022/udp/239.0.2.67:8208<br />ip-address is the IP or DNS name of the machine running udpxy, of course.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>									</div>
