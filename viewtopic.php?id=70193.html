					<p>Hello, I need a help to configure ipv6 in openwrt, I checked the openwrt wiki but I found it very confusing and I could not solve my problem<br />well, let&#039;s go<br />My Internet Provider (Vivo speedy) gives me a prefix 2804: xxx: xxxx: xxx :: dynamic, I make the connection openwrt to the router in nat mode the router works normally and can get ipv6 connectivity but I can not configure ipv6 on my internal network<br />What is the best way to do this confuguration?<br />Thanks for any help</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Gustavo,</p><p>Are you able to switch your ISP&#039;s modem to bridge mode ? If so, it will bring a much easier start and better end results for the IPv6 setup. Likely, the default OpenWrt IPv6 config would work above it.</p><p>I live in Brazil too and heard about some Vivo (previously GVT) xDSL modems that could be unlocked to allow switching to bridge mode.</p><p>If this is not possible in your case and you need to cascade the two routers, then I&#039;d recommend the relay mode (NDP proxy) for sharing the public /64 prefix with the downstream LAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>PS: I&#039;m a Vivo broadband customer too in Florianópolis. But since my internet plan is only 15Mbps with no TV subscription, I chose to use a generic D-Link ADSL modem in place of whatever piece of crap Vivo would bring to me. Then of course the bridge mode is available and is used to allow the OpenWrt router to fully manage the PPPoE tunnel and get the delegated IPv6 prefix from it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi andre thanks for replying, unfortunately not this modem is crap, I can configure bridge but if I disconnect and religo it returns to the default configuration, I understand maybe it is better to consider buying another modem but at the moment could you help me with the NDP configuration?

					<p>Hi Gustavo,</p><p>As several users have reported, NDP proxy is not working out of the box on OpenWrt. There are some bugs in odhcpd that prevent it. However, I wrote down the steps to make it work by doing some tweaks in the configuration. It&#039;s on this post: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=346368#p346368">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 68#p346368</a> .</p><p>I went through it step-by-step today, starting from a Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 stock configuration and confirmed it worked.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Gustavo,</p><p>I currently have no experience with LEDE, but I&#039;d expect that a newer odhcpd version would have the bugs fixed and would work out of the box. I&#039;m surprised you tried it with LEDE and got nothing.</p><p>From your modem&#039;s screen shot, there is no useful option that could facilitate the config. Essentialy, the ISP box is implementing both modem and router functions. But since you want LEDE to act as the router, the ISP device would really do better job if switched to bridge mode.</p><p>Your machine&#039;s ifconfig does not show the IPv6 addresses. Perhaps your LEDE router is now missing the odhcpd package because of uninstallation. Try installing it again from the normal LEDE repositories:<br />opkg update<br />opkg install odhcpd</p>									</div>
