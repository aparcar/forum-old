					<p>I&#039;ve got a Verizon/Novatel 5510L tethered to a Hootoo TM02 running OpenWrt? The Hootoo is running an OpenVPN client that connects to my VPN server through the 5510L. My devices connect to the Hootoo and get a direct connection to the VPN server.</p><p>The problem is the Hootoo is bottlenecking the VPN connection. If I connect to the VPN directly through the Verizon hotspot and use the openvpn connect app on my phone I&#039;ll get around 12Mbit down and 3Mbit up, but I can&#039;t use openvpn connect on my iPad for reasons beyond my control, hence this setup. When I connect through the Hootoo I get about 3Mbit/0.8Mbit which is way too slow for my taste.</p><p>So is there a faster portable router out there that has a USB port to tether and can run OpenWrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you use nat or so on on hootoo? If not, try to unload all modules, you do not need. (Simply move the files from /etc/modules.d to for example /etc/modules.bak.

					<p>with a 580MHz CPU you can get around 8Mbps through openvpn, that is the most you will find regarding ralink/mtk portable routers. some time ago i got tp-link MR22U with QCA9531 and i was able to clock it at 800MHz, did not test it&#039;s stability yet on the long run or openvpn performance but i think it should get you 12Mbps easily.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are some devices in the class with the MT7620 chips @ 580, but the list is thin<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_all?dataflt%5BDevice+Type*%7E%5D=travel&amp;datasrt=%5Ecpu+mhz&amp;dataflt%5BFlash+MB*%7E%5D=16">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_ â€¦ *%7E%5D=16</a><br />It pretty much comes down to the GLi MT300a and MT300n.&nbsp; The A is available with 128mb ram, and I think if you esquire there is a 256mb version indicated, but not in the store.<br /><a href="https://www.gl-inet.com/mt300a/">https://www.gl-inet.com/mt300a/</a><br /><a href="https://www.gl-inet.com/shop/">https://www.gl-inet.com/shop/</a><br />There are internal and external antenna versions.<br />It comes with CC 15.05 installed with a custom GUI that has support for many VPN services built in.<br />You can also get a &quot;Clean&quot; version of firmware from them and soon in LEDE.&nbsp; OpenWrt is only DD Trunk so package management becomes an issue for &quot;production use&quot;.</p><p>I would like to see how well the 256mb version runs with OpenVPN.......</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting. I had originally considered some of the GL-iNet stuff but ended up buying the Hootoo for $10 on eBay without looking at the CPU speeds cause I was an idiot. AR300M is only $35 so I might consider it.</p><p>What would be great is if I could get OpenWrt running on the Verizon hotspot itself...I got a root shell and found that it runs a Qualcomm MSM9615 and </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq</code></pre></div><p> returns 550 MHz. It also has 160mb flash and 48mb ram. Sadly, it doesn&#039;t have the tun module, nor the kernel headers which I need to compile it, and Novatel wouldn&#039;t send them to me so I can&#039;t get tun installed.</p>									</div>
