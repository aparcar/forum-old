					<p>I have a westell 7501 router which is nicely built. However, there are two problems. </p><p>1. The CPU is bcm 6359 which is not supported yet. BTW, I heard of million times that this CPU is a light version of BCM6358.</p><p>2. More importantly, the flash of this router is a little bit strange. There are two flash chips, K8P3215UQB (4M) total 8M. I tried to use jtag and serial console to load the CFE and kernel. </p><p>However, I successfully dump the factory software but failed to write into. To be precise, I can write into with /bypass option but the unit will not boot.</p><p>What I need is a updated JTAG with flash definition in order to write chained flash chips. OR, I can physically remove one chip and apply Jtag. </p><p>Any suggestions on CFE, kernel, and Jtag are greatly appreciated!!!!!</p>									</div>
