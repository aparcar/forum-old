					<p>Calling all those much smarter than I!</p><br /><p>So I&#039;ve tried out openwrt / dslrdashboard on the tplink mr-3040 - its OKAY.</p><p>But the software lacks something like the camrangers &quot;client mode&quot;, where images are just downloaded and reviewable, an interface without camera controls.... </p><p>I also&nbsp; think their software might be &quot;faster&quot; - so I wanted to install it and compare without initially buying the device.</p><p>So far, I do know the camranger runs on openwrt, and I&#039;ve looked inside the installer for camranger - there is firmware in there, but how to do I get them to instal them onto a mr-3040 ? </p><p>When I attempted to do so, but the firmwares were rejected by openwrt&#039;s firmware upgrade prompt with a reply of <br />&quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot;</p><p>SO, I&#039;m putting a bounty on instructions how.</p><p>This is on a V2.4 of the mr-3040 hardware.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what its worth for such an experiment? But it&#039;ll be money via paypal.</p><p>PM me.</p>									</div>
