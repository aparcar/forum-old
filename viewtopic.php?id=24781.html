					<p>hi Matco,<br />First thing to ask you. <br />Are you using any kind of voltage level converter ?<br />160NL is a 3.3 v device<br />Your old pc spits out 12+- volts..<br />you could possibly fry your router.</p><p>buy a CA-42 cable thats the cheapest and easiest way.</p><p>if you have already bought then there is a thread on this, topic <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=107904#p107904">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 04#p107904</a>, there are loads of posts which all describe how to do a serial connection.<br />try this wiki too, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl</a>.<br />if you still need help somebody will reply back to you on the forums.<br />If you have followed all of the above said things<br /> that is like..,<br /> 1. using 3.3 v CA42 or some convertor<br />2. your speed settings are like <br />speed&nbsp; 115200, parity none, bits 8, stop bits 1, flow control none,</p><p>and you are still getting garbage, it could mean<br />try making the length of ur 3.3 volt cable shorter, bcos its noise then,<br />trying changing your power supply to the OLD WRT54 GLv1.1 one.. bcos the newer switched mode power supplies have more noise.<br />and do not keep anything near these cable along the 3.3 v length part of it, specially things like cellphone. <br />again&nbsp; to avoid noise.... these things of point 3 seem to not make sense... but they do work. buts its noise (by definition unwanted signals)<br />4. try soldering the wires on ur board. bcos a loose connection is like a no connection but rather a bad connection. but this would void ur warranty for opening up the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mohnkhan</strong> on 17 May 2010, 08:47)</p>

					<p>First of all, thank you very much for your reply.</p><p>You&#039;re right, I didn&#039;t use any voltage level converter. I realized it yesterday by reading some posts in this forum. Hopefully, it seems that I didn&#039;t break the router. I&#039;ve bought a CA-42 cable, and I&#039;m waiting for it. Building the serial connection won&#039;t be hard because I soldered wires to the 3 pins inside the RJ45 port.</p><p>I&#039;ll keep this topic updated.</p><p>Matco.</p>									</div>
