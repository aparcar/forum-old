					<div class="quotebox"><cite>tmo26 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Why do you need /var on a persistent storage medium?</p></blockquote></div><p>1) I saw the very existence of a /var symlink as an invitation to do so by the developer who placed it: otherwise why not just dump everything to /tmp directly? <br />2) I want to start keeping persistent logs on file. Even if I saved logs to a different external directory, I believe I&#039;d still need to move the fstab script before the log script in order to mount that directory&#039;s partition before logging begins. Why not make the whole /var external and store logs where they are supposed to?<br />3) Where it makes sense, I like to keep my system as similar as possible to linux distributions I&#039;m familiar to. Hence, for example, /home and /srv symlinks. My squid implementation already makes use of an external var directory, with the usual lib and cache subdirectories. I&#039;d like the system to use this directory as var and keep things tidy.&nbsp; <br />4) In general, it makes a lot of sense to me (at least on an embedded device), that the system should mount as soon as it can whatever is set to be auto-mounted, treating external partitions as extensions of the root: it should make the assumption that files on those partitions may be required, possibly early on, during the init sequence. It is not the first time I&#039;ve had problems because fstab would run too late, and one always has to resort to unpleasant hacks to deal with this. I&#039;m no init expert, maybe there are reasons why this behavior is undesirable, but if so I&#039;d like to understand them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />5) Because it&#039;s a new problem and I&#039;ll have a very bad itch until I solve it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I guess a solution would be to write something like this in rc.local<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cp -r /var/* /mnt/sda1/var/

					<p>SOLVED<br />This assumes /etc/config/fstab has been configured so that the partition containing the var directory will auto-mount on /mnt/sda1. Make sure you are familiar with failsafe mode before trying this, as errors may result in your router not being able to boot.<br />1) In /etc/init.d/boot, before the first line mentioning var, add<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/sbin/block mount</code></pre></div><p>2) Disable execution of fstab at boot<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/fstab disable</code></pre></div><p>3) Give full permissions to the new var directory<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod 777 /mnt/sda1/var</code></pre></div><p>4) Replace old /var symlink with new one and reboot<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ln -sf /mnt/sda1/var /var &amp;&amp; reboot</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>endvour</strong> on 27 Feb 2017, 00:57)</p>
