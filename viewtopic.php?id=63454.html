					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I need your help/ideas.</p><p>I have 2 routers, one asus rt n66u and a linksys ea4500 with OpenWRT.</p><p>Asus is the main one, ip 192.168.1.1 with DHCP server on, Linksys has static ip 192.168.1.2.</p><p>Internet runs on both routers without issues. </p><p>I was trying to extend the WiFi signal from my 2.4 Ghz network from the Asus through the Linksys. Following <a href="http://javier.io/blog/en/2014/06/10/installing-openwrt-as-wireless-repeater.html">http://javier.io/blog/en/2014/06/10/ins â€¦ eater.html</a> - screenshot 3 (step Common configuration) i&#039;ve ticket the boxes as they are in the print screen. (initially switch tick was on my Linksys with OpenWRT)</p><p>As soon as i&#039;ve hit save, i was no longer able to connect to the OpenWRT router - not via GUI or console. When pinging 192.168.1.2 i was getting timed out. Asus sees it connected, if i plug a cable to Linksys i get network and internet and everything but i simply can&#039;t log into it anyhow.</p><p>Tried the firstboot option but with no luck.</p><p>Any suggestions how can i get access back to the OpenWRT router or reset it?</p>									</div>
