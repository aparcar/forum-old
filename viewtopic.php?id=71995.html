					<p>Hello, I&#039;m trying to compile a package that depends on a pre-compiled library. I have .o, .h and .so files of the library (though I&#039;m pretty sure .so and .h would suffice). The library files are in package/libs/libname. When trying to compile the original package, it calls package/libs/libname/compile as the library is a dependency of the package. However, as I said before, the library is already compiled and the task fails (I don&#039;t have the C files). How do I approach this problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>The binaries that you have must have been compiled for your target system&#039;s CPU type or they cannot work.</p><p>OpenWrt assumes that everything will be open source.&nbsp; Since your application package will almost certainly be the only one using the library, the simplest solution would be to put it in with the application sources and statically link it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 7 Sep 2017, 17:53)</p>

					<p>The thing is, I need a GPL compliant archive of my source code, and due to some licensing issues I&#039;m forced to use pre-compiled libraries. Static linking is not a viable solution as I have around 5 libraries and 10 packages that depend on them.</p>									</div>
