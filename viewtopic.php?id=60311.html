					<p>Hello, I&#039;ve got a bricked WDR3600.&nbsp; Tried everything but JTAG to bring it back to life, but it didn&#039;t happen. </p><p>So I&#039;m trying to flash it through JTAG. I&#039;m using a TUMPA and OPENOCD, but I don&#039;t know what configuration file to use for the OpenOcd target configuration file. </p><p>Anybody has any resoureces you can point me to or some adrive on how to go about it?</p><p>Or maybe some alternate SW I can use to flash the router?</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>VladR</strong> on 15 Oct 2015, 00:44)</p>

					<p>In my limited experience with OpenOCD, MIPS support isn&#039;t great, so it may be more of a challenge than you would like. Last time I looked, only MIPS4K was properly supported. The WDR3600 is a MIPS74Kc core, so your milage may vary.</p><p>The rough outline of what you&#039;re trying to do is something like:<br />1) Get OpenOCD to talk to your TUMPA.&nbsp; (configure interface stuff)<br />2) Get OpenOCD to retrieve the IDCODE from any test access points (TAP) present. Hope that the TAP you&#039;ve identified is the one you need and you don&#039;t need to configure JTAG routing. (configure target parameters)<br />3) Identify flash memory base address and RAM that can be used for scratchpad (configure board parameters)</p><p>You need to work through those steps in order, as they&#039;re dependant.</p><p>In terms of alternative SW, you can attempt to use URJTAG, but I don&#039;t have any experience with it.</p>									</div>
