Step by step this is what it does:</p><p>1: Tells it to pull the file &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-hornet-ub-jffs2-sysupgrade.bin&quot; from a tftp server and loads it to a memory address of 0xa0800000 which will be somewhere in the RAM.</p><p>2: This command tells the bootloader to erase a section of the flash, starting at address 0x9f050000 that is 0x790000 long.</p><p>3: Last but not so very least! Copy the information starting at address 0xa0800000 and put it at address 0x9f050000, only copying 0x790000 amount of bytes.</p><p>All of those commands you posted will need to be entered in to the bootloader.</p>									</div>
