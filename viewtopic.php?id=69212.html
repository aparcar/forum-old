					<p>&quot;Please don&#039;t believe in this stealth nonesense. If anything, &quot;stealth&quot; tells an attacker that there *is* a firewall dropping packets - it&#039;s like holding up a sign stating &quot;nothing to see here&quot;. Also dropping ICMP echo replies gains you zero security, if at all it just disrupts services. E.g. HE.net does not let you establich an IPv6 tunnel if you do not allow pings.&quot;</p><p>see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=137277#p137277">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 77#p137277</a></p><br /><br /><p>&quot;In general please don&#039;t buy too much into the stealth nonesense. It merely violates RFCs and does not prevent anyone from &quot;hacking your router&quot; or perform port scans. Modern scan engines are either massively parallel or distributed - they do not care whether you DROP packages.&quot;</p><p>see <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=250957#p250957">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 57#p250957</a></p>									</div>

Dropping all packets (what grc unashamedly calls &quot;stealth&quot;) is a distinctly different reaction than the network node up the line signaling back that there is no device connected. Or in other words: You don&#039;t answer, but one can see that you are not answering. Whether this encourages or discourages any behaviour is purely up to speculation.</p><p>&quot;You can DROP, but you cannot hide.&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 5 Jan 2017, 05:23)</p>
