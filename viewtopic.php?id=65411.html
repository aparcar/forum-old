Instead of shouting, keeping your finger on the exclamation mark button and being otherwise annoying, <strong>do provide what you did try and what did not work</strong>. At least then people can tell you what might work.</p><p>Don&#039;t expect people to do your homework for you. This is not paid support where people put up with lazy types.</p>									</div>
