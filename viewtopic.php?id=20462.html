					<p>Me again. I want to try another file system. I wonder if the ext2fs is the source of my problems (hungups). (the router had encountered power outages)<br />I&#039;ve dd-ed the squashfs on a computer with a big hdd and it says that the second partition is 48MB. My target computer however have only 32MB. <br />The big hdd computer doesn&#039;t start with Openwrt <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20457">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20457</a> (tryed ext2fs and squashfs) so i can&#039;t use it. So i&#039;m left with the small hdd one. </p><p>How can i install the squash file on 32MB ? How can i resize the second partition to something like 20MB to fit on my 32MB disc ? Or, can someone do it for me ?</p><p>I&#039;ve tryed the resize2fs but it gives me some error like &#039;doesn&#039;t know what that partition is&#039;. <br />What LinuxLiveCd can i use to resize a squashfs partition ? (now i&#039;m using DamnSmallLinux)</p><p>Can anyone help me ?</p>									</div>

					<p>You should be fine with dd the ext2-image to your HD. To change the second partiton (filesystem) select &#039;Target Image&#039; (in make_menuconfig), there you can change the size.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>linuxb</strong> on 28 May 2009, 08:33)</p>
