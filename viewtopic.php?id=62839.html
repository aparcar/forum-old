					<p>So I got code loaded a few weeks back and have been playing with some of the settings in the Luci UI. I noticed that I saw the 2.4Ghz radio options however I didn&#039;t see any 5Ghz radio features displayed in the UI. This router support 5Ghz and AC mode. Did I miss something? I installed FW on the 31st of Jan so I believe i have code that is somewhat resent. </p><p>Can someone from the ath10k experts that I was referred to review and chime in Please? </p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thinking more about this, I presume that maybe there is a v4.1 version of the ath10k package that needs to be applied and the one that is on the mirror site is a v3.18 version?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I figured it out. Thinking back when I first started, I installed the latest snapshot dev builds which was v4.1 of the kernel. Since the mains went down due to HDD issues, the snap shot builds have not been posted or not available again. So I unknowingly installed the v3.1 version of the 5Ghz file which would not work with v4.1. Going back and starting all over again with the stable version of OpenWRT v3.1, I was able to install the 5Ghz package and it&#039;s now available and displayed in the Luci UI.</p>									</div>
