					<p>Hi Fellas ,<br />I&nbsp; was just wondering if anyone can help me with this Belkin F9K1115V2.<br />I flashed OpenWRT firmware like a month ago. Now I would like to go&nbsp; back to stock firmware as I got an upgrade and i would like to sell it.</p><p>Issue is in OpenWRT GUI I can&#039;t flash stock .bin file. SO I google searched and they says I need to convert .bin file to .trx file which I did on linux dd command but still I was not able to flash. its just keep throwing error The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform. <br />Can anyone please help me. <br />Thanks in advanced.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gotojanoo</strong> on 4 Dec 2016, 19:08)</p>
