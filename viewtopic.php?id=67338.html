					<p>I want to add here my testimony regarding the difficulties to get port forwarding working. I had a lot of reading in this forum and I am NOT the only one to have this issue and mostly, OP didn’t give any solution, the thread stops; Found the solution?, Workaround?, Abandonment?<br />I spent at least 12 full hours to get it set-up and even now I don’t know why it’s working.</p><p>Hardware: TP-Link-W8970<br />Software: OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-149-g0d8bbd2 Release (git-15.363.78009-956be55) <br />New install.</p><p>I have in my LAN a Linux laptop (Software firewall off) with Transmission and I’d like to open port 51413.<br />With LuCI, Menu &gt; Network &gt; Firewall &gt; Port Forwards<br />New port forward:<br />Name: Transmission<br />Protcol: TCP+UDP<br />External zone: wan<br />External port: Blank<br />Internal zone: lan<br />Internal IP address: 192.168.1.115<br />Internal port: 51413</p><p>Yuo can also follow these posts from<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=336547#p336547">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 47#p336547</a></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /etc/config/firewall

I am sure, certain to follow the same process to test as now, I spent more that 12 full hours between 30th August and now 1st September, so 3 days. Modem and PC was switched OFF at night. I restarted all the applications. I was very precise, meticulous, careful and did a lot of checks in the process to test. I don&#039;t have any doubt that I didn&#039;t do any mistake in the set-up process.</p><p><strong>Yes it’s working with ONLY dest_ip and dest_port. NO need other port, NO NEED</strong><br />This confirms what I learned in a SISCO network training where I passed the exam few years ago.</p><p>For reference<br /><a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/tcp/ch02_06.htm">http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networkin … h02_06.htm</a><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#Packet_structure">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Data … _structure</a></p><p>This is just a testimony, I don’t know if this could help other, I am sure there will be others, but at least I don’t close the case without explanation.</p><p>Thank you for your reading and thank you to all here who helped me.</p>									</div>
