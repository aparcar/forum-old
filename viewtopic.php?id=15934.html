					<p>I apologize if this isn&#039;t the most appropriate forum.<br />My isp, ya.com in spain, supplies an smc wireless router. It&#039;s called SMC-7908-ISP, has a customized version of the firmware and there&#039;s virtually no documentation available on the net. It has an adsl port, a 4 port ethernet switch, wireless and 2 FXS ports.<br />I opened it and took some photos, unfortunately the main chip is covered with a glued-in heatsink.</p><p><a href="http://img512.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dscn1845rl6.jpg">[img=http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/8382/dscn1845rl6.th.jpg]</a><br /><a href="http://img443.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dscn1846ix5.jpg">[img=http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/6972/dscn1846ix5.th.jpg]</a><br /><a href="http://img443.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dscn1847rp1.jpg">[img=http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/224/dscn1847rp1.th.jpg]</a></p><p>As you can see in the wireless chip is an atheros 2417 (3rd photo), the switch is a realtek (2nd photo) and there&#039;s not much else there.<br />I suppose it&#039;s a danube because the firmware file (that I cannot decipher) it&#039;s called &quot;ya.com-FW-1.00.001(danube-AnnexA-ISDNx-FXOx-USB).bin&quot;, and there are references to DANUBE inside (e.g. there&#039;s an embedded zip file with a &quot;DANUBE_2.1.2.15.0.1.bin&quot; file).<br />On the second photo you can see a J2 header that&#039;s probably a serial port.<br />Do you think it&#039;s really based on the danube chipset? If so it should be possible to run openwrt on it, though I won&#039;t have the possibility to experiment too much since the device will be providing my main phone line (through its FXS ports).</p>									</div>

					<p>I got here looking for information about the same router and its internal parts. A great thing of it is that the memory chip is 512 DDR chip PSC A3S12D40ETP, but I don&#039;t know id the router chipset is supporting that whole amount of memory.</p><p>Anyway it looks like they are already working on this platform, let&#039;s hope it will be working soon and convert this router with a really old looking firmware to a great piece of firmware.</p><p>With a USB 2.0 port in it, a lot of RAM, VoIP with two FXS ports, and Atheros WiFi chipset, it could be a complete powerful communication center.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi sblanco, since I wrote that message I managed to connect a serial port (the pinout is the same as described at <a href="http://www.kessler-design.com/speedport-w700v/hardware.html)">http://www.kessler-design.com/speedport … ware.html)</a> and effectively it&#039;s based on the danube chip according to the bootlog.<br />OTOH I couldn&#039;t find too much documentation about danube in general and what openwrt can do with it (apart from this bug <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3484)">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3484)</a>, but I suppose that the openwrt port is based on an infineon reference design (<a href="http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/applications/wireline/cpe/adsl-gateway.html">http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/ … teway.html</a>), and the 7908 deviates from it since it has a different switch (a realtek rtl8306sd instead of the reference infineon adm6996ix), has a different bootloader (the shitty &quot;brn bootloader&quot; disguised as arcadyan bootloader) and it doesn&#039;t run Linux.</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, and if you want to play with the firmware, somebody has uploaded it to megaupload:</p><p><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/es/?d=X0JXSR0I">http://www.megaupload.com/es/?d=X0JXSR0I</a></p><p>The program sp300ex (which, btw, runs fine under wine) available at <a href="http://www.kessler-design.com/speedport-w700v/download.html">http://www.kessler-design.com/speedport … nload.html</a> is capable of splitting the bin file into its individual components, however the kernel and the pfs image use a different compression (they&#039;re not a simple zip anymore) and I couldn&#039;t find a way to decompress those files (I tried writing simple programs trying to uncompress the data part, after stripping the 0x21 0x43 0x65 0x87 signature bytes at the beginning, as lzma, lzo, deflate, bzip2) with no success.<br />I supposed it shouldn&#039;t be a too complex compression (since it has to be decompressed by the bootloader), but I cannot make sense of it.<br />It would be interesting to at least recover the file system to see what hidden pages are there (like, e.g.&nbsp; undoc_upgrade.stm or production.stm, the usb related ones are not really hidden since you can find them in the javascript).</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Does anybody know if this project is moving forward or will be obsolete? I bought one of these devices, hoping that it will be a perfect host for openwrt, but it looks like it is going to be forgotten (if it is not already). Could somebody suggest an alternate router which has similar architecture?<br />What I need:</p><p>- Atheros wifi<br />- USB 2.0<br />- Big enough RAM<br />- Above average processor speed<br />- Openwrt compatibility</p><p>I know WL500gp v1 with a Wistron CM9 atheros mini-pci card meets my requirements, but it is too expensive. I&#039;m looking for something similar to this SMC, but with better support.</p><p>Cheers,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dp79</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>How are things going with this router? This is the first post of mine, because I haven&#039;t found enough information on how to use OpenWRT with this router (I have an SMC7908A-ISP).</p><p>I&#039;ve had no problems on using OpenWRT with other routers: Fonera, Comtrend CT536, and Livebox. But with this one I&#039;m not able of doing anything with the information that is available, at least for my knowledge, maybe for others it&#039;s enough.</p><p>So far I&#039;ve only been able to open the router and find the J2 connector, which I guess is the serial conector. But that&#039;s it. Could anyone be so kind as to explain how to proceed from this point on?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
