					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;d like to hear recommendations from community - what Linksys router is the best to use with OpenWRT?<br />I have read FAQ and identified that Linksys <strong>WRTSL54GS</strong> &quot;Wireless-G Storage Router&quot; should work fine.<br />But it is not sold in Russia, where I am living.</p><p>Good news is that <strong>WRT54GL</strong> available.<br />Should it work well enough?</p><p>Another question - about draft-N wireless routers from Linksys.<br />Models:<br /><strong>WRT150N</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Wireless-N Home Router<br /><strong>WRT300N</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Wireless-N Broadband Router<br /><strong>WRT350N</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Wireless-N Gigabit Router with Storage Link</p><p>Have someone tried those models?<br />Does any of those work with OpenWRT?<br />I am not constrained on budget, I just want best available platform for OpenWRT - current release and future versions.</p><p>Thanks to any comments/tips!</p><p>Cheers,<br />Vadim</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vplessky</strong> on 19 Sep 2007, 19:58)</p>

It supports both Whiterussian and Kamikaze, it&#039;s up to you to choose your firmware. You just have to remember to set boot_wait=on, and your risk of bricking it is very very low.</p><p>I never tried Linksys N product, so I can&#039;t tell you anything about them.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a Wl 500Gp- I like it, but with one caveat, I can use kamikaze 7.07+ in 2.6 mode. seems like 7.07 started to use the 2.6.22 kernel and there are some broadcom stability issues - random segfaults.&nbsp; There doesn&#039;t seem to be much work happening on that front.&nbsp; I am not sure if it affect the linksys machine - but i am guessing so - as they are broadcoms!</p><br /><br /><p>I like the extra ram and the external usb ports. I am currently booting from usb stick, with a failback image i built myself on the actual router</p><p>One thing I am doing it using 7.06 kernel stuff - its 2.6.19 and building the rest of the packages from trunk, this should be okay as long as I don&#039;t try and install any kernel related packages</p>									</div>
