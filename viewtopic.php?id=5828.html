					<p>Recently I bought a Freecom FSG device (<a href="http://openfsg.com/">http://openfsg.com</a>).</p><p>As it doesn&#039;t have much software, I thought of installing OpenWRT on it.</p><p>It has 64 MB RAM, 266 MHz ARM CPU, builtin HDD, 4 USB ports, 4 ethernet ports, 1 SATA port, so it&#039;s powerful enough to replace some small servers.</p><p>As I can see, it uses big-endian binaries.</p><p>This is the /proc/cpuinfo output:</p><p>Processor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: XScale-IXP4xx/IXC11xx rev 1 (v5b)<br/>BogoMIPS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 266.24<br/>Features&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : swp half thumb fastmult edsp</p><p>Hardware&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Intel IXP425 Freecom Platform<br/>Revision&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 0000<br/>Serial&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 0000000000000000</p><p>As I checked on the Intel website, this processor supports little- and big-endian modes - so perhaps installing OpenWRT on it would be possible?<br/>I guess the most problematic part would be to change the endianness, to start with.</p>									</div>

					<p>The endianness is not a problem, the XScale port I did uses big-endian as well. Question is what changes are needed to support the device. You can try to get Kamikaze working, and in the meantime I try to finish the ethernet driver library for the port.</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like no big changes would be needed.</p><p>It seems to me that even the kernel is placed on the main partition on HDD, so perhaps to install a different distro there would be to just copy a proper &quot;base filesystem&quot; there?</p><p>Right now I&#039;m trying to get there debian-armeb, as it&#039;s already compiled for big-endian ARM.</p>									</div>

					<p>The XScale port is compiled for big-endian arm as well. The real question is how stuff stored on that router, and what kind of workarounds does it need, if it needs at all. Also note that my XScale port is based on 2.6.16, so maybe You need to port some drivers over from 2.4 (I&#039;m quite sure the factory firmware is based on that).</p>									</div>

					<p>Freecom kernel is compiled for Montejade with added patches to support onboard IDE. You might have more luck compiling buildroot-ng version of XScale 2.6 kernel. Make sure you enable debug messages. I don&#039;t know what machine id FSG3 uses. For example Billion router I played with had Coyote id on Redboot, but it fails with Coyote kernel. Compiling kernel for IXPD425 dev platform and patching machine id table on kernel so Coyote is treated as IXPD425 fixed it. Before that it hanged on booting kernel message. Enabling debug messages on kernel config will show you bit more information and clearly state if problem is due machine id conflict. Select only one machine type on kernel config. Enabling multiple ones is sure way to hang it on boot.</p><p>I have Freecom too (added it to OpenWrt wiki today) but haven&#039;t tried with custom firmware yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s &quot;sata_via.c&quot; in 2.6.17 that supports VIA VT6420 and VT6421. FSG-3 has VT6421 so it might work. You might need some PCI device enabling bits from Freecom 2.4.27, but that&#039;s beyond my knowledge and skills.</p><p>I don&#039;t know how to check machine id from Redboot. You could try building kernel with &quot;Kernel low-level debugging functions&quot; enabled under &quot;Kernel hacking&quot;. Then kernel tries to print sensible error message after &quot;booting kernel&quot; message instead of just hanging. Also remember that sometimes it seems to take up to 10 seconds before any output after booting message.</p><p>If you want to run little-endian environment you can probably get needed patches from NSLU2 kernel for LE ARM Debian. Simply changing option when compiling kernel is not enough. Of course you need to get working kernel before you attempt to re-use NSLU2 userspace binaries.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes it sees disk but I think it doesn&#039;t work correctly. There&#039;s long delay after it detects capacity and before driver prints &quot;ata3: qc timeout (cmd 0xef)&quot;.

I haven&#039;t tried using usb storage as root either.</p><p>Another issue with FSG-3 is cooling. There&#039;s that tiny fan that&#039;s spinning at insane speeds (9500+ rpm) and case is hot to touch. What good does that fan when there&#039;s no air inlets on case? Seems like design error to me. Only few small holes like that one for kensington lock. I tried to left front cover slightly open and within few minutes temps were down to normal levels and fan slowed down.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jr</strong> on 29 Jun 2006, 12:36)</p>

Doesn&#039;t fix actual problem with inadequate cooling. If you look closely there&#039;s plenty of space for fan to push air out, but lot less holes to get air in.
