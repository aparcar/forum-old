					<p>I have been debugging an issue with Comcast IPv6 where the prefix delegation changes every time odhcp6c is restarted.&nbsp; I believe I have tracked this down to odhcpc using hardware type 1 to create a DUID (Wide-DHCP which uses type 6 does not appear to exhibit this behavior).&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this problem?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>DUID-Type 1 is a static type as it only depends on the MAC-address of your interface so your ISP sees the same DUID for every request. This is in compliance and even required by RFC 6204.</p><p>Also there is afaik no type 6 and wide-dhcpv6 most likely uses type 3 and stores its DUID on the flash.</p><p>Also getting a different prefix each time is in general not a problem or bug but a privacy feature as it makes others less like to be able to track your actions.</p><p>I guess that wide stores the prefix it last received somewhere on the flash as well and indicates to your ISP as a hint to get this prefix again. This behaviour is not available in odhcp6c as of now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 27 Feb 2013, 14:13)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply, my initial thought was a privacy feature as well, the problem is that it is not clean.&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; downstream clients are not notified that the prefix they are using should be deprecated.&nbsp; Since the router no longer aware of the old prefix this results in an outage until clients restart there networks or the lifetime counters expire.&nbsp; Also Comcast has confirmed that this is not expected behavior.&nbsp; </p><p>As to Wide, it attempts to persist the DUID, but it does so on /tmp which is cleared on restart.&nbsp; Both Wide and odhcpc uses DUID-Type 3, the next octet HW type is what differs.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Right I confused DUID-type 1 and DUID-type 3, sorry for that.</p><p>As for the hardware type: Type 1 is Ethernet and type 6 is 802.xx. I don&#039;t think any of those is more right than the other.<br />Observing the behaviour on other Linux distros (e.g. Debian) both wide and ISC dhcp client seem to use hardware type 1 so I chose this for odhcp6c as well.</p><p>As for the changing prefixes and downstream client problematic. This is something that an IPv6 router must be able to handle (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6204#page-13">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6204#page-13</a> ).</p><p>If you use the default IPv6 implementation in OpenWrt (using 6relayd as RA/DHCPv6-server) prefix changes will be detected immediately after they happen and OpenWrt announces both the new prefix and the old prefix for a certain period of time.<br />The old prefix is announced with a preferred time of 0 (&quot;not to be used any more&quot;) and a valid time of &lt;2h.<br />This behaviour follows the IPv6 router requirements I mentioned above.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see your point. Though switchting to stateful DHCPv6 may cover the router power outage case it becomes problematic in the ISP is switching prefixes case (which from my point of view is more problematic).</p><p>For stateful DHCPv6 in that case it must support the Reconfigure-option both on client and server side and the server must be able to detect the prefix changes and issue the Reconfigure immediately. I guess that is way more complicated to get running compared to using RAs if you don&#039;t want your clients to use outdated addresses for a certain time.</p><p>Even if Comcast or $ISP assigns more or less static prefixes it is likely that $ISP2 does not.</p><p>Regarding 6relayd:<br />Until now I haven&#039;t been able to reproduce the instability on x86 but my atheros-router should arrive any day now so I can do some tests on the same platform. The stack-trace in the coredumps I got from users were also not very helpful so I hope I can get things sorted out with the new router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 27 Feb 2013, 16:24)</p>

					<p>The router lifetime does not expire. It is either sent as 1800s if there is a default route or sent as 0 if there is no default route (in which case we still announce prefixes with up to 1800s of lifetime or preferred time).</p><p>For internet access you need both a default route and a valid public prefix. So if you for what ever reason don&#039;t get RAs any more you will loose your default route after 1800s but would still have a publci prefix with a lifetime of several hours which doesn&#039;t do you any good because you can&#039;t route your packets.</p><p>Therefore I think it might make sense to cap the announced preferred and valid lifetime at 1800s as well and only announce something different if the addresses are not valid for full 1800s. This will allow the network to recover and or react faster than with the current cap of 24h.</p><p>If all of your prefixes expire (e.g. there is no public prefix announced anymore) as per router requirements we also send the router lifetime as 0s.
