I&#039;m following the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing.tftp">generic flashing instructions</a> and I have a few questions:<br />1. Does this device have a tftp server in it? In other words I want to confirm if I should follow the &quot;Bootloader contains TFTP client&quot; procedure or the &quot;Bootloader contains TFTP server&quot; procedure.<br />2. From your pc/laptop did you use the 192.168.0.66 address for `setenv ipaddr` or `setenv serverip` ?</p>									</div>
