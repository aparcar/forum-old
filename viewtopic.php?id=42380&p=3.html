					<p>hi guys<br />i have now usb to serial from laptop to my 8970 and when booting i see the massages on the serial application and i have intrupted the boot and got the VR9 prompt and can see the available commands in it.so i guess thats uboot prompt?</p><p>now my problem is many issues i have after this .the Rylos user says some stuff about ip and i have entered those but after tftp just times out. probably because of tftp issues on my linux laptop.<br />can somebody help me ? maybe step by step ,starting after uboot prompt?<br />can i flash from serial port without lan ?<br />if not do i need to connect lan directly to modem and laptop with no between router ?<br />do i need to have lan directly connected to modem and laptop BEFORE booting?</p><p>if you can&#039;t help me with step by step procedure, some info would be helpful.for example the tftp on 8970 is in client mode, right? does 8970 in uboot have telnet mode? basically is there a simple way of putting a file on it from serial other than tftp,cause my tftp server on manjaro linux is very buggy and doesn&#039;t start correctly without manual change .(i don&#039;t know why archlinux maintainer don&#039;t fix it) and after that i still am not sure if the server is running(though this is on me)</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>
