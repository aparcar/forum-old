					<p>Interesting couple of posts.<br/>I have dealt with James aka Sveasoft for a long time now (I was one of the first forum members there) and this is what I think about his posts here:</p><p>He is lying about subscribers getting the source code. The last source code release was in july 2005 and whenever somebody from the forum asked for source code in between, James promised that there will be a source code build system soon. I don&#039;t recall the exact date but it has been at least half a year ago that he first made that promise. Nothing has happened so far.<br/>I know this because I have access to the forums and am in contact with many other (former) subscribers.</p><p>Even if the does release source code, I&#039;m 99% sure that it won&#039;t be GPL-compliant. Its not hard to tell which parts will be closed if you know where his MAC protection sits. These parts include GPL code and I highly doubt he will release the source code to them.</p><p>The problem here is that we&#039;re not dealing with the average software developer here. It might be a personal issue but that guy has harassed me and others who tried to circumvent his &quot;GPL lockdown&quot; attemps many times. DCMA copyright violation notices, phone calls to my ISP claiming I was hacking his servers, emails to my email provider claiming I would be spamming his customers and so on. He&#039;ll go through great lengths to protect his faulty business idea.</p><p>If you honestly think he will EVER risk his business model by releasing &quot;proper&quot; source code then you don&#039;t know him well. We&#039;ve had the exact same discussion many times now but nothing has changed. I wonder why he fails to realize that the easiest solution is to seperate the GUI (and other non-free parts) from the GPL stuff and sell only the added value (plus support). </p><p>I guess it&#039;s because there is almost no code in there that was written by Sveasoft from scratch. He once made a list with all &quot;non-GPL&quot; parts of his firmware as an explanation why subscribers musn&#039;t redistribute. Turns out that almost everything on that list is written under a free license (although not GPL) and could be legally redistributed without a problem. So if he released a proper source code, anybody could just replace the few scripts he wrote from scratch and make a fully legal redistribution (how about OpenSveasoft *g*).</p><p>In conclusion: It&#039;s not gonna happen. If it does happen, I&#039;ll be the first to release a clean source code archive without MAC protection so everyone can make their own GPL binaries without being harassed or limited by Sveasoft.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TheIndividual</strong> on 25 Mar 2006, 14:06)</p>

Dynamic linking (or any other activity) cannot magically cause software to become licensed under the GPL. The only way software ends up licensed under the GPL is if the author decides to license it.</p><p>What does happen is, if you write some code and link it to somebody else&#039;s code, you can&#039;t distribute the resulting work unless you have permission from the author of the code you linked to. In the case of GPL&#039;ed code, the only way to get permission (apart from asking for a special case) is to license your own code under the GPL.</p><p>But, and this is important, it&#039;s always a choice. Simply linking your code with GPL code and distributing it does not magically put your code under any license - when challenged you can simply apologise for your license violation and cease distribution. The code owner could sue for damages, and might win cash, but it would be unlikely (IMHO IANAL) for the courts to force the violator to publish their own code because they&#039;d violated the copyright in yours.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Cookie.</p>									</div>

					<p>While I agree with your sentiment, it&#039;s largely wasted effort and empty threats that have been covered earlier in this thread. Do you have money and live in Sweden to press lawsuit directly? Or to fund someone who does? If not, it&#039;s just cartoony threats. As far as I&#039;m aware there haven&#039;t been any big GPL cases to date pressed from the GPL-side, and certainly no one has done any jail-time for it.&nbsp; There have been suits from the non-GPL side which have failed is all that springs to mind. In Wallace vs. FSF, Wallace had to pay court costs, which included only court fees not the lawyer fees for defense.</p>									</div>
