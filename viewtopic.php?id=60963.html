					<p>Hi,</p><p>Does anyone have a copy of the netgear DG834 adam2 enviroment variables? The router here mnaged to brick itself, the mesage on the UART is:</p><p>ADAM2 Revision 0.18.01<br />(C) Copyright 1996-2003 Texas Instruments Inc. All Rights Reserved.<br />(C) Copyright 2003 Telogy Networks, Inc.<br />Usage: setmfreq [-d] [-s sys_freq, in MHz] [cpu_freq, in MHz]<br />Memory optimization Complete!<br />Download.<br />Copying download from b0017000 to b4020000</p><p>And then it goes into failsafe mode. Now in failsafe mode, I can upload the flash via ethernet. But with duff adam2 variables doesn&#039;t help escape from the above.</p><p>Now in failsafe mode I should be able to upload both the OS, but also the adam2 env variables which are in flash at:</p><p>0x903e0000,0x903f0000 </p><p>But only question, os what should I load into that area of flash. So does anyone have a copy of that part of flash?</p><p>If no solution, might as well try flashing uboot - but that is a one time choice, e.g. can only do it by overwriting adam2, and that will loose me the fail safe mode ...</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah - this is going to be harder than I thought.</p><p>Managed to find a pspboot image on the net, and as that would fit in the 128KiB allocated to Adam2 decided to flash that.</p><p>Alas Adam2 failsafe mode refuses to update the boot loader. Its strange, the images from netgear seem to have the boot loader on the front, but whatever I upload looks like the bootloader isn&#039;t changed.</p><p>Sigh, means only way in is JTAG, and alas I don&#039;t have a cable (or knowledge) for that. I guess a cable like this is the one to go for:</p><p><a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_C232HM_MPSSE_CABLE.pdf">http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documen â€¦ _CABLE.pdf</a></p><p>Should be good enough to jtag many boards.</p><p>Does make me wonder what to do with this DG834 machine. if I&#039;m going to JTAG the flash, then I might as well try and adapt u-boot to work on it. AT least then I&#039;d have a modern boot loader rather than these ancient ADAM2 and PSPBOOT ....</p>									</div>

					<p>ftdi cable bought - won&#039;t be able to use it till I get the header mounted on the PCB, so that will probably be next week.</p><p>Just a thought as to why flashing the pspboot - does anyone know if adam2 does a checksum on the image flashed? E.g. the image I created, by stripping off first 128kB (adam2), and adding 64kB (pspboot) + 64kB (blank), failed to have a correct check sum and so wasn&#039;t flashed? Any ideas?</p><p>ANyway will keep going the jtag route ...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>djsummers</strong> on 30 Dec 2015, 12:18)</p>
