					<p>@ makedir</p><p>Greetings makedir-</p><p>Are you still having difficulty with your WRT1200AC? I am running an older build r4901 without any problems at all. I don&#039;t have a VPN or anything complicated so that might be the reason. Your latest comment about solving your reboot problem is good news and interesting because it involves the sleep probably using the kernel timer or software clock.</p><p>Have you considered building your own version of LEDE? The are a few people here who do that and have said the build isn&#039;t that difficult. I have considered trying that except am busy with other projects.</p><p>I think the advantage is that you could tailor your build to omit the things you don&#039;t use or don&#039;t want. Surely there is a lot of bloat because davidc502 tries to build for everybody wanting anything. The bloat can cause problems because the unused capability can conflict with the wanted capability. Configuring all of those many features can also be a problem because the combinational complexity is exponential making me want to simplify as much as possible.</p><p>An additional benefit is being able to examine the source code to find the cause of the problems. That code can point to the developers working on the code and make reporting problems to the developers more helpful. The code can show comments and explanations or modifications they have tried and be very informative for solving problems. Reporting problems and solutions to the developers can also encourage patches leading to a desired feature or result showing up in the final build.</p><p>There are instructions for building the LEDE and davidc502 has posted the configs he uses so that should make beginning less difficult. Be sure to start with a powerful machine to avoid waiting for builds. Just building for the WRT1200AC without the other builds would also save time.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

Because I had the same issue with Luci so far. Two times, when I opened Luci, the same second, the router rebooted. I am certain, that there is something wrong with the memory on these routers (this rom). Maybe the memory is wrongly clocked and overclocked with kernel 4.9, leading to rare memory corruptions. For example, my router hasnt rebooted anymore, since I deactivated a script of mine. It is a self written watchdog for OpenVPN, and it uses &quot;sleep 20&quot; in it. I had two times now this in the logs:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[318506.951336] BUG: Bad page map in process sleep  pte:00060000 pmd:1bd74831</code></pre></div><p>Since I deactivated the watchdog script, the router has not rebooted anymore. The sleep is triggered every 20 seconds in the script, which might cause a memory corruption way sooner than not using the script.</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>Right, I can believe that. *But*, this happen <span class="bbu"><em>once</em></span> for me. <br />All the other reboots have been triggered when client(s) connected to the wifi, almost always the 2.4ghz radio.<br />Let&#039;s say I&#039;ve had close to 100 unwanted reboots, and once of those have been from accessing luci, and it was from a 4.9k as you mentioned. But I&#039;ve tried other 4.9k builds too, and I didn&#039;t get any reboots from accessing luci with those. <br />So yeah, there might be an additional issue, causing memory corruption. But the main issue is still from the wifi, from what I can understand. I <strong><em>never</em></strong> had a reboot with the radios disabled, so..</p><p>Anyhow, I wanna add something. I&#039;m getting the sense, that the country region and/or the dbi have something to do with the reboots (at least with the reboots caused by the wifi). When I&#039;m running the radio set to the default country region, and the transmission power set to auto - I haven&#039;t been able to reproduce any reboots. If this is a coincidence, or if it actually has something to do with the problem, I do not know. Maybe worth looking in to?</p><p>Best regards - meffe</p><p>EDIT: may I ask where that openvpn script is located, which included &#039;sleep 20&#039;?<br />cause I&#039;ve seen that &#039;sleep 20&#039; running on my router too, maybe I could stop the script myself - and have some success avoiding some reboots.. thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meffovic</strong> on 30 Dec 2017, 12:30)</p>

Did that change for the same power output? If you installed the newer build using backup and restore settings then maybe the settings changed by themself so could you check the Network/Wireless/Radio transmit power.
