					<p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone has seen this issue when trying to connect a 3g dongle (I have tried ZTE MF112&nbsp; and Huawei K3520) to a Lantiq router.

It looks normal. So that&#039;s is definitely not an issue. I have the same kernel modules installed on w8970 and wdr3600 but it just hangs on Lantiq (w8970). Concerning the port number, MF112 uses /dev/ttyUSB2 (again works like that fine on wdr36000), my other dongle K3620 uses /dev/ttyUSB0 for the ppp.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have this problem too on a Netgear DGN3500. I found this bug report (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18424">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/18424</a>), which was closed, but I&#039;ve just reopened it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I do not see this issue on w8970 or another lantiq target (Bthomehub 5A) on DD trunk (self compiled). I have also used w8970 with &quot;eko&quot; build of CC and the 3g modem worked reliably. So it&#039;s a strange issue that went away for me when I moved from BB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dziny</strong> on 15 May 2016, 22:16)</p>
