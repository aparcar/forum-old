					<p>Hello-</p><p>I have two Access Points (AP&#039;s), one on each side of the building.&nbsp; I want them to talk to each other. Each AP is connected to the internet using an Android phone (the phones themselves act as wireless routers and the AP&#039;s just connect as a client).&nbsp; Each AP also has a bunch of wired hardware that it connects to the internet.</p><p>So the AP&#039;s work fine in solo, but I can&#039;t get the two to talk to each other.&nbsp; Here are the two AP&#039;s:<br />1.&nbsp; ASUS wl-500g v2 (running the 2.4 kernel)<br />2.&nbsp; D-Link DIR-615</p><p>Both AP&#039;s have Backfire 10.3.1 rc 5.&nbsp; It seems that WDS does not work between these two devices (different drivers).&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to get two wireless clients to work on either card (one for the android and one for the other AP).&nbsp; I see comments about relayd working in the latest release of Backfire, but that just sounds like another AP client.</p><p>The core of the issue is this question:&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it possible to have one card be a client to two AP&#039;s?</p><p>My T-mobile &quot;unlimited internet&quot; plan is actually limited to 5GB a month, so we really need the routing to both phones for both networks or the internet will be painfully slow (thanks t-mobile).&nbsp; So, I need at least one of the routers to handle two clients.&nbsp; Do I need to buy another whole router to get these two networks to talk?&nbsp; What options do I have?&nbsp; Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt;Suppose you were able to let the two APs talk to each other. What&#039;s next? How to control the traffics?</p><p>Each AP has it&#039;s own sub-net.&nbsp; Then, I would route the traffic as necessary.&nbsp; Default traffic goes thru the phone, traffic to 192.168.a.x goes to router a.</p><p>Overall, I&#039;m quite surprised about this limitation.&nbsp; The Luci web interface gives no warnings that what I am trying to do is going to break and then no errors when it does break.&nbsp; I spent hours debugging and troubleshooting this issue and really don&#039;t have a solid answer.&nbsp; It&#039;s really a simple question: can one radio connect to two clients?</p><p>In the end, it was cheaper to just buy another router.&nbsp; I like the idea of getting another entire unit instead of trying to debug a new USB device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Concerning the different modes a wireless device operates in, it would be nice to have some documentation on it.</p><p>Instead of putting it in the OpenWrt Wiki, this should rather go upstream:&nbsp; <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/modes">http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/modes</a>&nbsp; is VERY short</p>									</div>
