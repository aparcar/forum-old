					<p>Edit /etc/config/wireless, by adding a line &#039;option disabled 1&#039; to the first block.&nbsp; This will disable all wifi operation.<br />In safe mode you will have to do mount_root first to make the filesystem writeable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Mar 2015, 08:00)</p>

					<p>Is there a new firmware for these A900 boxes?</p><p>Reason I ask is that they still sell them, and I&#039;ve had mine almost a year, and it doesn&#039;t connect to N/5Ghz networks and sometimes has problems...if there is a newer firmware going that would great, since it seems to be OpenWRT based.</p><p>I&#039;m guessing I can&#039;t just add one of the atheros OpenWRT generic updates?</p>									</div>

					<p>Is i2s already integrated in the alsa driver, or how does it work? </p><p>Will ALSA see the AR9331 as &#039;soundcard&#039; and then stream all PCM data to the I2S_DATA line? Or is it still needed to compile stuff?&nbsp; Thats unfortunatly still beyond my skills so i hope ALSA is enough to get started.</p><p>A friend of me has a few DAC&#039;s that I may&nbsp; give a try.</p>									</div>
