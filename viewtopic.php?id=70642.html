					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;\ve purchased it to add an external hdd to the network and make it a NAS.<br />Unfortunately, their software is SH!t.<br />Looked for an alternative and found openwrt.<br />I must say that I don&#039;t have &#039;mount points&#039; by default.<br />And it didn&#039;t update the opkg by default. Had to do a system upgrade.<br />Now, I see that there is a problem with NTFS, so I am trying to install exfat which is not installed by default in its build.<br />When I try to install it local from opkg install /tmp/exfatname.ipk it still downloads the old version for the older kernel.<br />I tried ti change the name in config, but don&#039;t know how to change it so it will accept it as source.<br />Do you guys know any solution to this?<br />I just want to add the NTFS (that I will backup, format as ExFat and transfer the data back to) external hdd and access it from the network. IF possible from outside the network, it would be great!<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
