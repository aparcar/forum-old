					<p>I just bought the Asus RT-N12 ($35 on Newegg for an N v2 router?!?!&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t pass it up!).&nbsp; And while it&#039;s listed on the DD-WRT site, it&#039;s apparently not working with OpenWRT.&nbsp; I spent about 2 hours trying to get Kamikaze, then Backfire, then Gargoyle working.&nbsp; After a little bit I found a page referring to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/asusrt-n16">problems with the RT-N16</a>.&nbsp; Apparently this affects the RT line of Asus routers.</p><p>Sooooo... my question is:&nbsp; Does anyone know when the Asus RT line of routers will be supported?&nbsp; It&#039;s weird that DD-WRT is working, but OpenWRT is not.&nbsp; I do see there are some differences with the way that DD-WRT presents itself to the CFE, so it seems we have some clues to the problem.</p><p>I have neither the time nor the expertise to lend a hand, I&#039;m just wanting to bring this up and perhaps to the attention of someone who might have more of both.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yet another bump. Any interesting news on this matter?<br />Also, could it be that some revision is supported, whilst another is not?<br />I mean, there are RT-N12v1, RT-N12B1, and RT-N12C1.<br />The second two only differ on the looks (I think), while v1 has different chipset.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have two routers of this series: an RT-N12B1 and an RT-N12D1. The D1 correctly works with OpenWRT. However, there aren&#039;t any WiFi drivers yet, so I reverted it to the stock firmware.</p><p>Now I am looking to try OpenWRT on the B1. Here&#039;s that model&#039;s wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n12b1">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n12b1</a>. My questions are 1) Which image should I download? and 2) Will I be able to get WiFi working with it?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
