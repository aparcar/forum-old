					<p>If we can ensure that the device specific pages have consistently easy to find links to the recently supported version I would also advocate taking the URLs off the ToH. In my mind the ToH should be used to drive people to the device specific pages which almost always have some useful/important information on them so we should encourage visiting the device pages before downloading the firmware. The device pages are a bit of a mess too so I suppose after cleaning up the ToH the next thing would be to do a standardized template for device pages which makes some of the important information easy to find and consistent from device to device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I would agree that both tables have their uses. If you already have a router and want to check it out then the simple table is fine. If you&#039;re looking to purchase a router which is supported by OpenWrt and you want certain features the second is better. That said it&#039;s still a little limited, it would be super nice if you could do more advanced querying... For example if I&#039;m looking for a router that is supported by the current version of OpenWrt, has at least a 650MHz CPU, USB ports, 802.11n, gigabit switch, and 32 or more MB flash. I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s really possible in the wiki though.</p>									</div>
