					<p>First of all thanks for reading my question, and for any help you can give me.</p><p>Ok here is the problem I have a network that is a bit strange but I need it to be like this.</p><p>I need to have N different networks with the same configuration each one with a private access to the internet, but also I need to share a server by them all.</p><p>So I am using a custom openwrt firmware on a TP-Link WR842ND.<br />What I did was to configure all routers (with dnsmasq disabled so it does not ghave a dhcp server) with the same IP address and I conneced the PC to the router ports. And to have internet acces I connected the router/modem to the last port of the router TP-Link WR842ND.</p><p>Each TP-Link WR842ND is connected via WAN to a switch. This switch also has the server (with the shared services) connected.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.minus.com/i7JBTnruADBp3.png" alt="http://i.minus.com/i7JBTnruADBp3.png" /></span></p><br /><p>In order for this to work I need to have the LAN and the WAN with static IP. I am using the folowing configuration in /etc/config/network:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> 
config interface &#039;loopback&#039;
    option ifname &#039;lo&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;

config interface &#039;lan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.7&#039;
    option gateway &#039;192.168.1.254&#039;
    option dns &#039;192.168.1.254&#039;

config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.0.0&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;10.10.0.1&#039;
    option gateway &#039;10.10.0.254&#039;

config switch
    option name &#039;eth0&#039;
    option reset &#039;1&#039;
    option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;

config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;eth0&#039;
    option vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;</code></pre></div><p>But with this configuration I do not have access to the internet on the router TP-Link.</p><p>Is there a way to do this? What am I doing wrong?</p><p>NOTE:<br />If I put the WAN in DHCP I can have internet access.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>edsousa84</strong> on 14 Aug 2012, 17:44)</p>

					<p>Oh I see you have the physical gateway attached to your lan, then obviously delete the gateway from the wan config. There must be only one single gateway in the config.</p>									</div>
