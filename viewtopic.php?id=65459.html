Trust me, the forum will be a better place if you follow that advice, you certainly are quite busy increasing the noise in the forum. You might say, so am I, the big difference is that I am willing to accepts a little more noise and do not constantly pester people by telling them my opinion on their posts.

Be that as it may...</p><p>So since you seem to understand the rules behind own goals (I assume you actually read the link you posted) the only reasonable explanation is that you consider your argument that &quot;Max Hopper has provided resources to the OPer&quot;* to be your own goal, to which I heartily concur. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But on the unrealistic chance that you consider your postings that basically tell openwrt users basically &quot;take you question to another forum&quot; to be worthwhile resources you would like to have had when your experience was at what you perceive the poster level to be then let me share a resource with you. Max be &quot;so kind to help reduce the forum SNR and&quot; post &quot;support elsewhere&quot;. You are not helping the forum SNR at all with what I like to call your quixotic quest for forum purity according to Max Hopper; and your not helping improve the forum atmosphere unless you start to be a bit more forgiving...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as I said you lost this one. So count your losses, lick your wounds, and move on, really... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless you truly deliver a zinger of a next reply, I intend to leave you the last words in this thread. I would be pleasantly surprised if these would be &quot;I came to the conclusion that the forum could do with less hostility and zealotry and more friendly and firm guidance, and I intend to help improve the forums further&quot;... as&nbsp; I still believe you could could consistently be a great resource in the forum, if you wanted to...</p><p>*) I have to admit, your awkward reference to yourself in the 3rd person, does allow for easier quoting, so thanks for that.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

If you feel they are wrong, simply ignore them and do NOT bother to post a (hostile) response. Trust me, the forum will be a better place if you follow that advice, you certainly are quite busy increasing the noise in the forum. You might say, so am I, the big difference is that I am willing to accepts a little more noise and do not constantly pester people by telling them my opinion on their posts.
