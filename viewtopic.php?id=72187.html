					<p>Hello,</p><p>I want to use an Arduino Yun as an access point for a small local network.&nbsp; However, I also want to be able to add that Yun to a public network for internet access.&nbsp; It can do one or the other, but can&#039;t seem to do both simultaneously.</p><p>Can I add a USB NIC to a Yun and use OpenWRT to achieve this?&nbsp; I read that the NICS must be bridged, I am far from a networking expert so I am looking for:</p><p>1.) confirmation that the above scenario can be done<br />2.) Example settings/configs/scripts to accomplish the above scenario.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>The hardware you have and OpenWrt can do this already.&nbsp; Set up a routed client to the public AP.&nbsp; This interface is the WAN network.&nbsp; Meanwhile you can have a private AP running on your LAN.</p><p>Search for &quot;routed client.&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks mk24.&nbsp; I have found this page: wikiDOTopenwrtDOTorg/doc/recipes/routedclient</p><p>When i try to follow the steps, the network changes force a disconnect and I can&#039;t seem to reconnect to the device.&nbsp; I have to reset wifi to factory defaults.&nbsp; </p><p>is this the same routed client concept you were referring to?</p>									</div>

					<p>If your client can&#039;t connect to the public AP for some reason (out of range, wrong encryption), your private AP that is running on the same radio will go off the air.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Sep 2017, 19:34)</p>
