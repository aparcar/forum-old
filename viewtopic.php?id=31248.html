					<p>background is I used to have a wrt54g, and loved it with openwrt, I want to get another, but want to hack usb on to it. I looked for HOURS online to find any info, nearly everywhere said it can&#039;t be done, but I found 2 things that say you can.</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3082">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3082</a><br />found clue that usb is supported but not implemented.</p><p><a href="http://woodhousellc.com/?tag=usb">http://woodhousellc.com/?tag=usb</a><br />shows someone that has done it! (added usb to wrt54g).</p><p>I would like to know which versions of the wrt54g I could try this on, and where to connect to? I think version 2, and am hasy about exact way to do it, but may just try myself!</p><p>any ideas? interesting though! brings a whole new life to the best (imo) router for openwrt.</p>									</div>
