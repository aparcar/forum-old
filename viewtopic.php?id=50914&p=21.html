					<p>@arokh I would very like to install this new builds of your because I really liked you old ones but I have a few questions regarding it:</p><p>1.

					<p>1. The difference is in the name, 760MHz vs 800MHz overclock and noipv6 means no ipv6. I&#039;m running the noipv6 build myself and it most definitely doesn&#039;t have it, kmod-ipv6 isn&#039;t included in the image. You can look at the config file which is included in the release directory or /etc/openwrt_config on your router.</p><p>2. If you&#039;re referring to the &quot;tor&quot; and &quot;vpn&quot; interface, they are needed for those functions. Do whatever you like with this build, but don&#039;t expect support if you do <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Source and diffs are available so you can see yourself the difference between vanilla openwrt if you like. Not really that much except preconfigured services, and they should all be configurable through UCI. Removing interfaces will surely mess up the releated services. If they weren&#039;t needed I wouldn&#039;t include them.</p><p>3. Use the &quot;general&quot; section of this forum for questions unrelated to the build.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also understood those naming the way you described it now. But when I went into LuCi I noticed sections about ipv6. Of course no devices were listed but I thought that was because I have ipv6 disabled on all my devices. Did not know that LuCi has those sections no matter if ipv6 is actually enabled.</p><p>Thank you for clarification on this things.</p><p>Sorry about the unrelated questions.

					<p>@arokh</p><p>The discussion about who is arrognat is rly off topic so lets leave it be. I posted my posts here because 2/3 of them were actualy about YOUR builds and THIS topic. I posted the third also here so I would not spam the entire forum with my problems and because i knew you in particularly KNOW this matter. I immagened ppl here were friendly and kind. I guess I was wrong. It is more important to you to attack ppl like me and make an elephant out of a fly. Sorry! I will go and read entire OUTDATED Wikipedia about OpenWRT and study all there is posted in forums and will find out by myself how to do it. Thx</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, absolutely. I&#039;ve done a test run and it builds just fine. There&#039;s nothing really Netgear specific in my builds except maybe button configuration which I&#039;ll look at when I get it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I suggest creating a thread in the general section and/or creating a ticket, the question is unrelated to this build and therefore better posted there so others can help and be helped.</p><p>There was a commit regarding odhcpd recently: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/42217/trunk">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/42217/trunk</a></p><p>Might be related I wouldn&#039;t know.</p>									</div>
