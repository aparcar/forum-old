					<p>Hi!</p><p>I´m running Kamikaze on a Bullet2. When i try to flash a new firmware via web interface, it tells me that this action is not supported on my platform. Since the Bullet is mounted in a location that is difficult to reach, i am looking for another way to access it than pressing the reset button after a reboot (which makes it accessible via tftp). Does anybody know of any solution? A posting on ubiquiti´s forum has not yielded any answers yet...</p><p>Regards G.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>There are various possibilities. What&#039;s your exact version? You can reflash kernel and rootfs via mtd, even with keeping the configuration.

					<p>Thanks for the heads up! I&#039;ve missed that one.</p><p>However, I&#039;ve tried it (8.09.1 and 8.09.2RC2)&nbsp; on the PicoStation2, but: </p><p>1.) 8.0.9.1 it somehow got screwed up totally<br />2.) 8.0.9.2RC2 took a long time to come up after the reboot and then it had the default config, IE had to telnet in etc, no changes were applied.</p><p>It seems the jffs2write option for mtd is also not working correct on PicoStation2.</p><p>1.) If I try and do jffs2write to rootfs it goes through, but no changes<br />2.) If I try and do it to rootfs_data it complains about no space in device.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, Progress at last!</p><p>Here&#039;s the steps I took to preserve the settings during an upgrade:</p><p><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">I&#039;m not sure whether it will work every time, or even if they are technically sound. </span></strong></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#Copy the new kernel to /tmp
cd /tmp
scp &lt;username&gt;@&lt;servername&gt;:&lt;path to kernel&gt;/openwrt-atheros-vmlinux.lzma ./

#Reflash the kernel
mtd -e kernel write /tmp/openwrt-atheros-vmlinux.lzma kernel

#Mount the jffs2 partition as read-only ( To see which is the jffs2 partition: cat /proc/mtd -look for &quot;rootfs_data&quot; )  
mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock3

#Bit copy the jffs2 partition to /tmp
dd if=/dev/mtdblock3 of=jffs.bak

#Remount the jffs2 partition as read-write (May not be needed?)
mount -o remount,rw /dev/mtdblock3

#Delete the kernel from /tmp
rm /tmp/openwrt-atheros-vmlinux.lzma

#Copy the rootfs to /tmp
scp &lt;username&gt;@&lt;servername&gt;:&lt;path to kernel&gt;/openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs ./

#Reflash rootfs:
mtd -e rootfs write /tmp/openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs rootfs

#Mount the jffs2 partition as read-only  
mount -o remount,ro /dev/mtdblock3

#Bit copy the jffs2 backup back to the jffs2 partition (WARNING: This takes up to 10 Minutes or more)
dd if=jffs.bak of=/dev/mtdblock3

#Reboot the unit and see if the setting were preserved
reboot</code></pre></div><p>The above procedure allowed me to upgrade from 8.09.1 to 8.09.2 RC2 on the Ubiquity PicoStation2, maintaining the specific settings applied to the unit like the IP address etc.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dvdwalt</strong> on 6 Nov 2009, 14:18)</p>
