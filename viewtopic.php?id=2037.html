					<p>Ok, from reading a bit, I know I need to patch the CFE bin file with the MAC address from the router sticker (if the cfe does not come from the same router).</p><p>I got my CFE bin file from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/inh/cfe/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/inh/cfe/</a> and the associated txt file.&nbsp; In there, I changed &quot;et0macaddr=&quot; to my mac.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if I also need to change the &quot;il0macaddr=&quot;, as the &quot;sample&quot; cfe file contains a different MAC in both il0 and et0 fields.&nbsp; Ran nvserial, and jtagged the new cfe.</p><p>Doing this, I managed to debrick my wrt54gs.&nbsp; But there is one thing I don&#039;t understand:&nbsp; If I &quot;dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 bs=1 skip=4116 count=2048 | strings &gt; /tmp/cfe.txt&quot;, I can see the mac I patched in the cfe.txt file, but I&#039;m wondering why &quot;nvram show |grep mac&quot; shows different macs for et0 and il0...??</p><p>Any thoughts??</p>									</div>
