					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I&#039;ve been an openwrt user for quite some time but as of late I changed my service to 1GB symmetric Fiber and the openwrt router i used so far (Buffalo WZRH300N) no longer cuts it. The wired performance is ~200mbps up or down.<br />I have a new AC Router (Netgear Nighthawk X4S R7800) which is plenty fast but Openwrt or LEDE currently isn&#039;t stable enough for WiFi usage (no problems with wired).</p><p>So for now I plan to keep the Netgear R7800 using the stock netgear firmware as my primary router+AP which gives me very fast ethernet+wifi. Behind it, I&#039;d like to keep the buffalo router but simply to run my asterisk server, disable dhcp, firewall, wifi, etc and bridge it with the R7800 router&#039;s subnet.</p><p>Any ideas what i need to change in my buffalo. I have a chaos calmer/barrier breaker build on the buffalo (i think).<br />I would like to plug from the R7800 LAN port to Buffalo WAN port and provide it a static IP, and bridge the wan/lan of the buffalo to make them seem like a single interface. I leave all the firewalling/nat,wifi,dhcp server to the R7800.<br /> I basically need to run my asterisk server as if its running on the main router.</p><p>Thanks,<br />chhatc</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chhatc</strong> on 26 Jun 2017, 01:46)</p>

					<p>It sounds like you want a dump AP<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a><br />It uses a LAN port, not the WAN.&nbsp; You may be able to re config the port for WAN to LAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>You would not even have a wan network on the Buffalo.&nbsp; &nbsp;Delete it.&nbsp; Everything in or out of the Buffalo is now LAN.&nbsp; Set the LAN static to in the range of the main router and set gateway and dns to the main router.&nbsp; Turn off the DHCP server both v4 and v6.</p><p>To make the wan port lan, so you have 5 LAN ports, either reconfigure the switch or if there is a dedicated eth into the CPU from the WAN port, move that into the lan bridge.</p>									</div>
