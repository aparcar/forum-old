					<p>Guys,</p><p>I am setting up an in-car PC based on Raspberry Pi. I plan on using the TPLink 703N.</p><p>My initial thoughts are that when my car is parked near my house i would be able to SSH/Web into the TPLink in the car and get it to send a wakeup through an Arduino based relay to bring the Rpi awake and then use Rsync from a home Linux box to keep my music up to date.</p><p>When on the road i want to use a 3G USB modem to provide Internet access to the in Car LAN clients (RpI etc)</p><p>Is there a way to have the TPLink use the WIfi connection as its preferred method to talk to&nbsp; the net but when this is out of range to falback to using the 3G modem - obviously once back in range when the car returns home it would then go back to using the Wifi Connection </p><p>Craig</p>									</div>

					<p>OK it looks like MultiWan is the way to do this - probably need to cobble together some scripts to bring it all together as MultiWan only appears to see up/down events for an interface - not sure how the 3g dongles react - do they come up when they are attached or when they have an internet connection ?</p><p>Same with the wireless/wifi - does it go down when it can not associate with its chosen AP ?</p><p>Testing to be done</p><p>Craig</p>									</div>
