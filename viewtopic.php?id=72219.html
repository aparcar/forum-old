					<p>I have a tp-link device running a custom build of Chaos Calmer, r47065 with very little on it.<br />There are no usb or video drivers. </p><p>When I connect a webcam to the device, openwrt seems to crash. <br />However, this happens randomly, not every time I connect the webcam.</p><p>Does this make sense to anyone and what should I look for before installing the required drivers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projects</strong> on 2 Oct 2017, 20:53)</p>

					<p>Without further debugging info, there isn&#039;t much to tell - except to put a powered USB hub between router and camera for testing (the camera might pull more power from the router as its PSU can offer)</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes true, I don&#039;t have much information at this point. I thought maybe it might be something obvious or known.<br />That&#039;s an interesting point about powered or not. I do power the device with a powered hub but it might not be enough. I&quot;ll keep testing.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yup and if there were any, I&#039;d have posted them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.<br />It just dies, that&#039;s it, no errors, no output, just stops running.<br />But as I said, it&#039;s random so far.</p>									</div>
