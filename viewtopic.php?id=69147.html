					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I need a little help getting started with OpenWrt.&nbsp; I have been playing with DD-Wrt for a while now but my Asus RT-N56U was not supported on DD-Wrt.&nbsp; I decided to take a jump into OpenWrt for a little challenge and I am stuck.&nbsp; Here is the pre-story:</p><p>I have three routers.&nbsp; (1) A Netgear wndr3700 (2) a Linsys Wrt54GS and the (3) Asus Rt-N56U.&nbsp; The wndr3700 is my main router.&nbsp; It does dhcp, controls two guest networks (Adult and kids), does access restrictions, and runs a VPN, all very successfully.&nbsp; Within the last week, I made up my mind to stop having ump-teen wireless SSIDs in my house and start meshing them so people could roam through out the house and get the best WiFi signal.&nbsp; Pretty easy with DD-WRT.&nbsp; I am having a tough time with OpenWrt, mostly because it is new. Anyway, here is the rest of the story.</p><p>Both the adult and kid guest network have a G and 5G SSID.&nbsp; The kids get issued IPs in the range of 192.168.2.100 through 105 and the adults get an IP range of 192.168.3.100 through 105, mostly so I can control internet access on the kids section.</p><p>Here is what I have done so far in OpenWrt.<br />(1) successfully created all the SSIDs and their encrypiton.&nbsp; I created a bridge (br1) for the kids and (br2) for the adults.&nbsp; I linked each bridge their respective G and 5G SSIDs as well as eth0.&nbsp; I can see the SSIDs, enter a password, but the won&#039;t connect as they can get a valid IP from the wndr3700.</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>In DD-WRT I needed to add some extra settings using DNSMasq which I tried here with no joy.&nbsp; I did try and follow the Wide area Wi-Fi coverage Wiki but didn&#039;t get anywhere.&nbsp; I also downloaded an SSH program and cant figure out how to do anything with it.</p><p>I know I sound like I am over my head and I probably am but I always figure it out.&nbsp; Just need a little shove in the right direction :-)</p><p>TIA,<br />Dan</p>									</div>

					<p>update:</p><p>I have figured out a couple things:</p><p>(1) I upgraded to Chaos Calmer 15.05<br />(2) My 802.11an radio successfully broadcasts a 5g-adult and 5g-kids wireless signal<br />(3) my 802.11bgn radio successfully broadcasts an adult and kids wireless signal<br />(4) I have successfully bridged the 5g kids and kids wireless signal to Br-br1<br />(5) I have successfully bridged the 5g adult and adult wireless signal to Br-br2<br />(6) all four access points seem to give the proper IP address (Adult 192.168.3.100-105 and Kids 192.168.2.100-105) but I am not sure the IPs are coming from my main WNDR 3700 and the devices take forever to connect and get an IP.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t surprise me if the Asus N56U is assigning the IPs but I don&#039;t know how to check.</p><p>With all of that, I still get no internet access on either of the WAPs.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>TIA,<br />Dan</p>									</div>

I think the WNDR3700 is the workhorse and the Asus is just a dumb AP but I am not 100% sure. I have really been struggling with this one. I love a challenge though. I will get it. What information can I give you to help though?&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks,<br />Dan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pdobrien3</strong> on 3 Jan 2017, 17:19)</p>
