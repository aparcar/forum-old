					<p>Well, just for reference, since someone here is hacking besides just me..</p><p>i just bricked my ar525w. the neat part is how. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>given that the firmware upload pages won&#039;t let you upload from linux, i&#039;ve found that both the ping and traceroute utility will run arbitrary commands. for example, placing &#039;; ls -la /bin&#039; in the box for traceroute.</p><p>eventually, i discovered and set up /bin/tftpd. actually, i had two copies running when this happened, one called as &#039;tftpd --help&#039;, and another called as &#039;tftpd /tmp&#039;.<br />i&#039;m not sure which one i pushed in my firmware image using, but i pushed openwrt-rdc-jffs2-64k-ar525w.img to the device using tftp. this of course had to happen on the LAN switch, not the wan interface.</p><p>I now have a brick. as soon as i get serial, i&#039;ll post what i get for output.</p>									</div>

					<p>well, i finally got a serial port, and found i&#039;m having the same issue as another ar525w user. namely, waiting forever at &#039;Please be patient, while OpenWRT loads ...&#039;</p><p>which means my new &#039;method&#039; of flashing, without having internet explorer worked. now, if we can just find out whats going wrong with our images.</p><p>is there an official method of restoring the original OS on these devices? i&#039;d like to have a bit more of a guide on tftping in an image than the above. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hello all,</p><p>Has anyone gotten wireless working on the ar525w?</p><p>I&#039;ve got the latest trunk (r12557) with rdc/airlink targets up and running like a champ except for wireless.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve got /etc/config/wireless setup correctly:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  wlan0
    option type     mac80211
    option channel  5
    option disabled 0

config wifi-iface
    option device    wlan0
    option network    lan
    option mode    ap
    option ssid    openwrt
    option encryption none</code></pre></div><p>Am I missing something simple?</p><p>The ra2x00 drivers are in the build but it seems like maybe the driver script (/lib/wifi/mac80211.sh) needs to be updated?</p><p>Thanks to everyone who&#039;s helping out on this project.</p>									</div>

					<p>So it looks like the default make targets do not include hostapd, without which the wireless interface can&#039;t be set in to master mode. The card was running fine in client mode. Doh!</p><p>For future reference: If you want your wireless to run as an <strong>ap</strong> it helps to have host<strong>ap</strong>d running.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.<br />I have Edimax BR-6315SRg which seems to be same device with RDC 3210 SoC, Ralink wireless and Realtek Ethernet switch.<br />I do not want to mess with soldering a COM-port and wonder if I can load fresh compiled Kamikaze trunk image through default original Web interface and then get the thing up and running.<br />Do you think it is possible?</p>									</div>

					<p>The latest 8.0.6 stable Kamikaze image: openwrt-rdc-squashfs-ar525w-web.img seems to work very well.&nbsp; </p><p>I have been running it for a few hours and was very pleased with the smooth installation process and the simple luci interface.&nbsp; </p><p>I just loaded the image using the firmware loader available in the Airlink web gui, it rebooted as designed.&nbsp; <br />Openwrt did not enable the wireless adapter by default, so i plugged my laptop using an ethernet cable, got a 192.168.1.x ip address<br />logged in, and started playing around.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Getting WPA seemed a little harder than it seemed at first since I was getting an error about a required package,&nbsp; but playing around in the shell I did an opkg update and an opkg upgrade which gave me no feedback,&nbsp; but when I went back the WPA option were available.&nbsp; </p><p>Im very excited as the airlink firmware had some issues i&#039;m hoping will be resolved, eventually I intend on using the unit as an AP client so I can bridge some other devices.&nbsp; <br />I do want to update to x-wrt and perhaps play around with some of the VPN modules/packages and perhaps some more advanced firewalling features to replace my aging sonicwall unit.</p>									</div>
