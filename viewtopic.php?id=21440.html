					<p>I am using Asterisk 1.6.1.0-1 on kamikaze 8.09.1, I want to have the callback feature which needs pbx_spool.so module. Anywhere that I can download this module? or if I need to compile it myself, how to add it into the package? Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>coolbird</strong> on 20 Sep 2009, 18:37)</p>

					<p>Thanks again Hans!</p><p>From my exprerience, it seems 1.6.2b2 in current svn is quite stable on Openwrt though I&#039;ve put a script to reboot once a day as a precaution. (1.4.x and 1.6.1 needed it) <br />However, 1.6.2b2 itself is a bit buggy and a lot of patches have been released upto 1.6.2rc2. If you can bypass those little bugs - related to call parking, config parsing, memory allocations, etc. all minors - 1.6.2b2 is good to go.</p><p>BTW, Asterisk version numbers mean almost nothing, since stable version&#039;s sub-versions and patches are so rapidly released. Betas and rc&#039;s all shares lots of bugs and stable release are not that special.&nbsp; So just stick to whatever you can puy your hands on at the moment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>test011</strong> on 2 Oct 2009, 20:59)</p>
