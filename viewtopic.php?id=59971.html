					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I was running 15.05rc3 on a TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1, and install &#039;StrongSwan-deafult&#039;, but then upgraded top the latest stable version &quot;OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45)&quot;. However all the previously (not much) installed software disappeared.

					<p>Some of what you wrote suggests that you did not UNCHECK the flag &quot;Keep Setting&quot; and thus the path to the packages is wrong.&nbsp; It needs to be the path to the final release.&nbsp; The message about kernel is because there was a kernel version change and the strong swan package you are trying to install is for the old kernel.</p><p>You probably should reflash the system with the sysupgrade, uncheck the keep settings, and then reinstall all your packages.</p><p>I will suggest you keep a test file with the packages you install and save for future reference and upgrade.&nbsp; You can also, for the same version of SW (ie CC) backup and then restore your config.</p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … x/generic/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>To Answer my own question (hopefully), yes, the OPKG-Configuration for the sofware respositories was not updated in the upgrade and was still pointing the the /15.05-rc3/ directory.</p><p>Have updated the OPKG-Configuration and remove the reference to &#039;RC3&#039;, updated the package list and re-tried the update, and all has seemingly worked.</p><p>Look like there was also an extra reference in the OPKG-Configuration that pointed to Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/packages/targets/,">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm … /targets/,</a> but this doesn&#039;t appear in the main 15.05 directory.</p>									</div>

					<p>The factory is to convert factory firmware to OpenWRT.&nbsp; If you have OpenWRT running use the sysupgrade.&nbsp; </p><p>You can backup your config and reuse it, though take a good look.&nbsp; I can not say that nothing was changed during the upgrade, though expect nothing was.</p><p>You could get lucky, change the downloads directory, and just reload packages and may be ok.&nbsp; I just think it&#039;s safer in the long run to do it right, especially if you have not done much config to it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RangerZ</strong> on 29 Sep 2015, 00:52)</p>
