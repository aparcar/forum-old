					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have recently installed the Backfire&nbsp; 10.03.1 on a netgear DG834G router which was previously running the netgear firmware. The firmware seemed to go on fine and I was able to log in to the OpenWRT web interface to make configuration changes. Unfortunately whilst logged in, I stupidly deleted the LAN interface (stupidly getting click happy thinking I was on the Wifi interface tab on my smart phone!) and I can no longer find the IP address of the device. </p><p>I have tried pinging 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 after rebooting the router and also after holding the reset button in for failsafe mode, but I cant seem to get any response. The router seems to be working though as when it boots up in normal mode, I can see the unsecured OpenWRT wifi - but unfortunately I can&#039;t get the IP address of the router to try and ping/telnet or SSH to it.</p><p>The router was flashed taking a similar route to the one described here:-<br /><a href="http://compulsive-evasion.blogspot.com/2010/06/openwrt-on-netgear-dg834-adsl-router-v2.html">http://compulsive-evasion.blogspot.com/ â€¦ er-v2.html</a></p><p>During the flash stage, I configured ADAM2 so it would start up with the IP of 192.168.1.5 in order to transfer the .bin files via FTP. After the installation, the router was configured so it was not a DHCP server and had the static IP of 192.168.1.5. I have tried to ping/telnet/ssh to this address but do not get anything <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Is there a clean reset button combination I can use to completely reset the device to factory defaults rather than using the failsafe mode?<br />When I get into what I think(!) is the failsafe mode, I see the routers power light and test lights alternating between eachother (power flashing green, test (tick) light flashing orange) - but in this mode, I can not get access to 192.168.1.1 in the same way I have accessed another OpenWRT router (WGT634U) in failsafe mode.</p><p>If anyone can recommend any methods to clean boot the device or if there are some other ways to access the device or if my perceived failsafe mode is actually incorrect then any guidance/info would be much appreciated! I have a JTAG unit so I might try using that if all else fails, but seeing as the router seems to be semi-functional, I was hoping to find a reset procedure that might be easier...</p>									</div>

					<p>Problem Resolved!<br />The v2 unit does not have JTAG so I was unable to use that. In the end I downloaded the Netgear DG834G recovery utility and a copy of the latest netgear firmware. I ran the software from a WinXP based machine (with ethernet IP set to DHCP client). The recovery utility found the router ONLY after getting it into failsafe mode by holding down reset button after plugging in power cable to make the power and test light flash (alternating between eachother). I then proceeded to go through the recovery screens and the router was restored back to Netgear&#039;s firmware ready for another OpenWRT install.<br />Intrestingly I tried running IP config after the software discovered the router, but it didn&#039;t give me any useful info as to what the router&#039;s IP address was.</p><p>Anyway, it&#039;s working now so that&#039;s good news. I will now be extra careful not to delete the lan interface...</p>									</div>
