					<p>FYI, for anyone, like me who upgraded and lost ext root the following tidbit from the wiki is important.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>On Barrier Breaker, block-mount will create a file /etc/.extroot-uuid on extroot filled with uuid of mtd partition rootfs. At boot time when trying to do extroot, block-mount would try to check the actual uuid with the content of .extroot-uuid. If they did not match, extroot would fail. So if you want to continue use extroot after flashing a new firmwre, /etc/.extroot-uuid needs to be deleted first.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

This is no problem however, you will have to install the desired package via command line, using the following commands:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg install yourpackagename --force-depends</code></pre></div><p>However, I doubt you&#039;ll have enough space on the rootfs in order to install adittional packages.<br />You could expand your rootfs using a USB stick and additionally add a swap partition to it in order to gain more stability.</p><p>Please read this guide: <a href="http://redacacia.me/2013/04/08/openwrt-usb-external-storage-with-rootfs-swap/">http://redacacia.me/2013/04/08/openwrt- … otfs-swap/</a></p><br /><p>--edit---<br />You probably do have enough space on rootfs. You have 16mb flash, which is enough, where as the TL-WR1043ND only has 8mb.<br />For this reason I cannot add Strongswan to the build, images for other routers would be too large for the flash...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk13139</strong> on 12 Feb 2014, 16:13)</p>

					<p>Hello Jorge,</p><p>300mbps is only the possible theoretical speed, which in practice is unlikely to reach due to interferrence.<br />You can try to move your device close to the router and see if the speeds go up.</p><p>As for inSSIDer, the device you&#039;re testing on has actually a 40mhz wifi card?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello mk13139,</p><p>Thanks for your answer.</p><p>I will try side by side with one of the devices and keep you posted.</p><p>Regarding inSSIDer, yes It is the device on line 8. I will move it near and try again.</p><p>Thanks<br />Regards<br />Jorge</p>									</div>

The image would exceed the flash size. <br />I removed Tranmission support also, because some routers have too little resources and would crash when running Transmission.<br />However, when a external drive is added to the router it is possible to move the rootfs and swapfile to the drive, in order to install additional packages such as Transmission and MiniDLNA.</p><br /><p>In this build, I also added support for the TP-Link Archer C7 and the TP-Link TL-WR740N.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk13139</strong> on 10 Mar 2014, 10:44)</p>
