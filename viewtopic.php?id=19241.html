					<p>Hi there,<br />I as you can read in my topic heading, Iâ€™m trying to run MPD on my WGT634u.<br />I got Kamikaze setup and running, but struggle to get mpd running.</p><p>It always keeps on asking me for lib&#039;s when running it.<br />And when I try to load them one after the other I run out of memory.....<br />F.e. libcurl.so.4,etc......</p><p>Which packages do i need?? I read some How to&#039;s but have not been able to set it up.</p><p>I want to connect a USB Disk with my music to it and then control the MP Daemon through wireless with my Ipod Touch. </p><p>I just can&#039;t get it setup properly.</p><p>Has one of you the following setup running and can send me a backup which a can just upload through Luci? (Is that possible anyway?)</p><p>- MPD running and accessible trough IP+Port<br />- Support for USB Sound Cards<br />- Support for &quot;Plug and Play&quot; USB Storage</p><p>I would greatly appreciate your help.</p><br /><p>Cheers,<br />Fieten</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fieten</strong> on 7 Mar 2009, 03:06)</p>

					<p>I have the same issue. With the old 7.09 (2.4) everything was fine. Intstall usb, audio stuffs, then &quot;ipkg install mpd&quot;, this installs some dependecies too, and mpd starts without problems. I upgraded to 8.09 (2.4) intstall usb, audio packages, then &quot;opkg install mpd&quot;, installs mpd and similar dependencies like 7.09, but mpd won&#039;t start, missing libcurl. I install libcurl, then missing another, etc. I tried 8.09 (2.6) but i stucks in the beginning, because my usb drive mounted twice automatically...</p><p>Now i downgraded to 7.09. Of course 2.4 because in 2.6 random segfaults.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LaySoft</strong> on 11 Mar 2009, 00:45)</p>
