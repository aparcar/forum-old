					<p>AP -&gt; Repeater Bridge = Same client IP network. Doable ??</p><p>I can currently achieve this with dd-wrt<br /><a href="http://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Repeater_Bridge">http://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Repeater_Bridge</a></p><p>on both a linksys and a buffalo, what i am trying to determine is can this be accomplished with<br />openwrt and x-wrt gui.</p><p>in essence, i dont want the clients connecting to AP2 ( repeater ) to be on a separate subnet/netmask as AP (primary).</p><p>we have one dhcp server for the whole lan, i have currently a number of WDS APs, im moving away from WDS to repeater. We want all APs, Repeaters, Clients connected to anything on the same subnet, and to get their dhcp from a single server in the ops center. not from the APs. this is accomplished easily with dd-wrt in repeater bridged mode, how can i configure this in openwrt, seeing as its cleaner, more stable. i also dont want to get wrapped up in the dd-wrt fiasco going on, but i seem to be in a stangle hold since id dont see a way for x-wrt to accomplish the same scenerio. please tell me im wrong.</p>									</div>
