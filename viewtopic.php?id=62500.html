					<p>My problem with the WR1043ND is not necessarily a network slowness, but uneven performance of the userspace applications. It&#039;s barely possible to navigate Luci over Ethernet because of long stalls and broken connections, and SSH connections sometimes stall for minutes at a time, sometimes are jittery (ping output from router doesn&#039;t happen each second).</p><p>The system looks fine: 3M free memory and 0.05 load. I noticed that the stalls disappear when I ping the router with interval 0.2s (the only other activity apart from SSH), so it&#039;s related to network activity. Is it a driver issue?</p><p>I recently upgraded from Attitude Adjustment to Chaos Calmer, but I&#039;m under the impression that this issue happened before the upgrade.</p><p>Any tips appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, that was not the problem.</p><p>While I didn&#039;t find the root cause, resetting the router to default configuration seems to help.</p>									</div>
