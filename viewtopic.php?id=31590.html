					<p>Hi guys ,<br />Thanks for reading this post .</p><p>I&#039;m pretty sure i&#039;m not the first having this problem, but can&#039;t seems to find an answer anywehre...</p><p>So here it is :<br />I set up my DIR-601 with bleeding edge, r28007 as an OpenVPN Client:</p><p>The router successfully connect to the OpenVPN server, no problem.<br />The router is told by the OpenVPN server to redirect every traffic to the VPN tunnel.<br />From the router , i can ping the internet, or do whatever I want, everything is fine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />I can even confirm form the server that all traffic is going through the VPN Tunnel.</p><p>But as for the client connected to the router , they cant see any of the internet side when the VPN tunnel is up &amp; running...<br />If I turn off the OpenVPN tunnel in the router, then eveything works...<br />As if the forwarding to device TUN0 wasnt allowed...</p><p>Any toughts on that problem ?</p><p>Thanks a lot !<br />Pepsidrinker</p>									</div>

					<p>I found the problem, in case anyone has the same :</p><p>You need to enable forwarding FORWARDING &amp; MASQUERADING.</p><p>I followed these steps :</p><p>In /etc/firewall.user, add the following lines:<br />------------------------------------------------<br />## Set tun device to act as default connection to the Internet.<br />## Notice the -o tun+. This indicates that it is looking for outbound packets on tun+<br />iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o tun+ -j MASQUERADE</p><p>## Accept all outgoing traffic to the Internet via the tun device<br />iptables -I OUTPUT -o tun+ -j ACCEPT</p><p>## Allow all outgoing forwarding connections<br />iptables -I FORWARD -o tun+ -j ACCEPT</p><p>## Allow only ESTABLISHED incoming packets.<br />## I guess this is for normal web browsing as you establish a connection first via a HTTP request<br />iptables -I INPUT -i tun+ -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT</p><p>## Allow all incoming forwarded connections through the tun interface<br />iptables -I FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT</p><br /><p>Restart the firewall and you should be ready to go !</p>									</div>
