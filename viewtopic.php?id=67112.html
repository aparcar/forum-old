					<p>Dear OpenWRT Modders,</p><p>I have a Comfast AP CF-E320N AP. This AP is a bit awkward (based on MT7620N) and there should be openwrt firmware for this thing. <br />At least Comfast says that. After Skyping with them i received some files with who&#039;m you can build your own firmware for this AP.</p><p>Except i don&#039;t have a clue where to start.....</p><p>Who is willing to help me, either explain, or build it for me? it is just this once!<br />I can send to zip with the files (23MB)</p><p>Many thanx in regard,<br />Kirelam</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kirelam</strong> on 24 Aug 2016, 10:36)</p>
