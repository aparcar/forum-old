					<p>I&#039;ve had one of these for some time now with dd-wrt installed, I&#039;m thinking of giving openwrt a shot, is this a no go because of dd wrt already being on it or is there an easy way to put it back to oem and then install openwrt?<br />Apologies if this is covered in a topic here, just looking for info..</p>									</div>

					<p>Easiest is probably to use the TFTP method (push reset during boot at a correct moment).<br />It allows you to install any of the firmwares without going back to OEM in between (as the functionality is in the Uboot boot manager).<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#recovery.flash.in.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … lsafe.mode</a></p><p>You need to install the &quot;factory.img&quot; version of Openwrt with that. (&quot;sysupgrade.bin&quot; will not work.)</p><p>Ps. If you want everything working out of the box, you might test my community build for WNDR3700:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 8 Oct 2014, 17:54)</p>

					<p>dd-wrt should have no role, as the recovery flash tool is in boot manager, and I don&#039;t believe that dd-wrt would overwrite that.</p><p>After entering the recovery mode (and waiting for TFTP transfer), the power LED should blink rather slowly.

					<p>Im thinking here that maybe it cant be flashed back to factory, at least not without a netgear img. The process you describe can and does work for factory routers, just not fot ones already flashed to something else.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have debricked my Openwrt routers a dozen times with that TFTP method. I have flashed Openwrt images and once or twice also an Netgear image. The process works ok, as long as you have the correct firmware for your router (v1, v2 or 3800).</p><p>Try to flash a genuine Netgear firmware.

					<p>I understand, however, it isnt bricked. And Im not dissing the firmware or the process, just in this instance it doesnt work, and its really not worth flashing back to oem specs, it did however take a web flash of a newer dd wrt image just fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>DD-WRT does something funny that makes it hard to remove sometimes. Reverting to stock is definitely the way to go first. I&#039;d ask for support on their forum with regards to that. Then flash to openwrt once you&#039;re back on stock.</p>									</div>
