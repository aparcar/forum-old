					<p>I&#039;m giving away a WRT55AG (v2, the one based on Atheros) if someone would like to spend some time trying to get openwrt up and running. Anyone interested? If yes, I propose that you find a WRT55AGv2 near you and I&#039;ll transfer the money to cover it to you through Paypal.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm...The device looks interesting.&nbsp; I downloaded the 1.1 source and it looks like it actually uses the Broadcom drivers there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the v2 sources even out yet.&nbsp; The documents that I read on it don&#039;t say that it&#039;s Atheros for 1.1, so that may be new as well.</p><p>I&#039;m probably going to go out and buy one in a week or 2 to hack, since the pictures of the internals on Seattle Wireless</p><p><a href="http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/LinksysWrt55ag">http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/LinksysWrt55ag</a></p><p>However, it would be helpful to e-mail opensource@linksys.com to find out about the status of the new source, and perhaps the status of the WRT54G2P.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm...Even more interesting...</p><p>Basically the main difference that I can see with the WRT55AG and the WRT54G is the boot loader.&nbsp; The boot loader for this is installed differently (with CFE) , but other than that, it looks pretty straight forward.&nbsp; The WRT55AG v1.1 still looks like basic Broadcom hardware with wl and il (802.11a version of wl).</p><p>Also, the default filesystem on this is cramfs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve compiled a firmware with telnet enabled for anyone who is interested in poking around in this for 1.1</p><p>I also checked out the 2.0 firmware from the website.&nbsp; The firmware seems to be very broken (1.3 MB instead of 3.3) and it&#039;s a .fim file, whatever that is.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRT55AG v1.0 is basically a WRT54G v1.0 with another mini-PCI.</p><p>The WRT55AG v2.0 is based on the Atheros 5312 WiSoC. It&#039;s a 200MHz r3k big endian MIPS.

I was under the impression that the WRT55AG also was running Linux so I think I have to take back the offer until the Linux port is in place. Are there any free VxWorks development utilities around, or do one have to buy the whole package, which, as far as I can see, is expensive as h*ll, from Wind River?</p>									</div>
