					<p>@JW0914</p><p>1) The emphasis is the problem. I read it as use an old release with broken wifi, if you need wifi use an even older release candidate. Using the current release (15.05.1) is unsupported, expect your device to brick.</p><p>2) Opening the case means voiding the warranty, most should avoid that if it can be helped. In case you need a serial console the usb2tll cable should be the recommended method. It&#039;s a 5 minutes walk to the next shop which carries them here. If I order one I have it delivered next morning.</p><p>Mine is just another voice as well, as you have taken responsibility for that page, yours obviously carries more weight.</p><p>3) The corrupted bootloader section is valuable and shouldn&#039;t be removed. My point is, the files offerd most likely only work for the v1. Dry testing it on other models will likely brick them. I leave it to nitroshift to confirm or dispute my expectation.</p>									</div>

					<p>@JW0914</p><p>Indeed, I can&#039;t speak for other countries. But unless Linksys explicitly states a user can open the case to access the serial port doing so will void the warranty in Switzerland, which I did on day one btw. Can you point me to such a statement?</p><p>On the other hand there was an EULA of some sorts when booting into linksys firmware saying something along the line of voiding the warranty by putting 3 party firmware on it. That clause is invalid here as it says openwrt on the boxing. So putting openwrt on the device is an intended use-case and can by no means void the warranty here.</p>									</div>
