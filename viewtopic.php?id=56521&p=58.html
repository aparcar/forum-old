As long as it is added with some meaningful information, of course.</p><p>if it is about adding a new unsupported device to brands with no supported devices, I agree with you.</p><p>It is important to understand that information is not valuable just because someone put it in the wiki.

I helped some people to reach support for a device by making patches and sending them to the mailing list without owning the device, and probably this could be impossible without info like OEM bootlogs, gpios used by leds/buttons, flash type and so on. </p><p>Other times info about several boards, even when not supported, on a particular target helps to improve support for the supported ones.</p><p>Of course if someone wants to get support for a new particular device, there are more chances to happen if first the target is already supported, and second if he sends the device to a developer or somebody with enough knowledge and with the willingness to make the patches.</p><p>For me, bootlogs and board pictures (good quality) of router/devices are extremely valuable info. Wikidevi is OK for this purpose.

					<p>I like this:&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/playground/create_new_device_page2">https://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/playgroun … vice_page2</a> People seem to want to add devices to the ToH; this form goes a long way toward helping them provide good information about the status of the support.</p><p>Some comments to make the page more clear:</p><p>- The Usage list at the top needs to be reworked to match the order of the items below it. It might make sense to add explanation for some of the steps. </p><p>- I&#039;d like to see the Status dropdown with this wording, in this order: [ Well supported, WIP, No support (yet) ] (Let&#039;s put the desired/most important state at the top)</p><p>- The &quot;Template Supported&quot; dropdown might have items of [ Supported, In development, Empty template ]</p><p>- I wasn&#039;t clear about the Destination. Does &quot;inbox&quot; mean it goes to some administrator? </p><p>- It appears that there is only one Destination for each Status selected. Instead of using a dropdown for Destination, perhaps the text of &quot;Select Destination&quot; should simply say:<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;- (for Supported) This information will update the Table of Hardware<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;- (for Not supported, WIP) This information will go to the inbox/administrator</p>									</div>

					<p>Just in case we didn&#039;t have enough confusion in the ToH, I wonder if it&#039;s appropriate to include another status - &quot;LockedDown&quot;. </p><p>The new FCC rules appear to be causing router vendors to lock down the firmware so that third-party updates cannot cause wifi signals to be out of spec.&nbsp; See my topic asking for reports of vendors/routers/etc. at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=312009">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=312009</a></p>									</div>
