					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have long been planning to get a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND, but that was back when there was no v2.</p><p>The v2 looks like a moron. I&#039;d never want such a silly design.</p><p>The benefit of the 1043 was that it has a factory firmware that supports loopback, ie. you can reach your internal hosts from the internal network through the external IP and the port forwards you have configured.</p><p>Many routers do not support this. It is pretty much required if you host internal servers and you want mobile devices to be able to seamlessly move in and out of your LAN.</p><p>That, and it was well known as an OpenWrt device.</p><p>But the TL-WR1042ND is based on a Realtek chipset and is not supported by DD-WRT at least. So it seems like I&#039;m back at square one with finding a replacement for my D-Link DIR-655 that doesn&#039;t support loopback and also is not supported by OpenWrt.</p><p>I mean I&#039;m not in a rush here, it will still be a while before I really need it. But I&#039;m not happy with this change. </p><p>I&#039;m currently moving my modem/router/NAS into the meter cupboard in the hallway. Living room wireless LAN coverage will probably be handled by a Fonera running OpenWrt. For the time being. That&#039;s no &quot;n&quot; router, just &quot;b/g&quot;. So I&#039;ll have to see about performance.</p><p>What are good alternatives for the TL-WR1043ND v1? Requirements are:<br />- simple functional case design<br />- gigabit switch<br />- loopback in default firmware<br />- wireless &quot;N&quot;<br />- OpenWrt support</p><p>Perhaps I should just get a non-wifi router but they are very rare and unheard of I believe. Makes no sense to buy a device that costs the same but lacks potential wifi capability. Perhaps I should just get a second hand TL-WR1043ND v1 when the time is there.</p>									</div>

But that aside, I suggest you make a decision and stick to it as to whether you are going to use Openwrt or not. If you&#039;re going to use Openwrt on it, then whether the default firmware supports loopback is irrelevant. </p><p>As for those requirements, the WRT160NL meets all of them, except I don&#039;t know if the stock firmware supports loopback.</p><p>You could also try the WR-2543ND, which being a TP-Link, probably has the same features as the 1043ND. Actually, the stock firmware <em>is</em> Openwrt, though a rather old and modified version of it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong> on 25 Jun 2014, 20:03)</p>

					<p>I replaced my WR1043ND with a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n750">Western Digital My Net n750</a> because I wanted the 5GHz band. They are not produced anymore (WD gave up on networking hardware, the emergency flash makes me think it is made by D-Link anyway), they work perfectly with Barrier Breaker, are virtually unbrickable, and they come really cheap now (I got mine second-hand for around â‚¬12!).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 25 Jun 2014, 21:55)</p>

Such things are prone to experimentation and having two options is much better than just one option when you don&#039;t know beforehand how it will work out.</p><p>Like, I have that Fonera to play with but OpenWrt is extremely hard to configure from my experience because the UCI abstraction doesn&#039;t really map the underlying system very well. I had to spend way much time to understand the limitations and find a way to get around them (and for a very common use case as well). Let me just check what I did, just for illustration: I had to add this line to my firewall:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A forwarding_guest -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP</code></pre></div><p>..because there was no way to specify forwarding relationships in the config file that had a negative implication. I could deny all forwards for my guest zone, but then it wouldn&#039;t have WAN access, and I wanted to give it WAN access while denying it access to hosts on my LAN. And it simply wasn&#039;t possible.</p><p>So if I am going to get busy with OpenWrt again at some point in the future, it will not be as an ordinary user, but I&#039;m going to want to dissect the abstraction, show where it goes wrong, and demonstrate how much more powerful it could be if it employed meaningful concepts instead of weird made-up ones.</p>									</div>

Unless it&#039;s the first time you&#039;re using Openwrt - at which point sure, you&#039;re welcome to experiment.
