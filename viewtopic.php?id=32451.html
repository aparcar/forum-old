					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have a wndr3700 v1 running Backfire 10.03.1-rc5.</p><p>Regularly, but after a random amount of time (usually around 1-3 hours), all wifi devices connected to the router lose their connection, at the same time. After a few minutes they are able to reconnect again.</p><p>I love OpenWRT, but this is very annoying as there are some things in my home that stop working when the wifi drops out.</p><p>How should I go about troubleshooting this? When it happens, hostapd is still running and everything looks normal. I don&#039;t see anything fishy in the syslog, and dmesg looks ok. </p><p>The router has two configured SSIDs on two different subnets running off the same radio at 2.4GHz in g mode. The 5GHz radio is not used currently. When it happens, all devices get disconnected regardless of which SSID they use.</p><p>Wired connections are not affected at all, they are rock stable.</p><p>Ideas, anyone?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the exact same frustrating issue.&nbsp; It&#039;s so stupid that I have to either power cycle the router or ifup/down the wireless to get it working.</p><p>I thought I found a script online that you could have cron run every minute or so to check some status and if bad up/down the connection automatically.</p><p>This is clearly not ideal as you&#039;d still have up to a minute drop (online games unplayable via wifi probably), but it at least makes me wife happier when I&#039;m at work.</p><p>This was fixed in a later build of the stock firmware, so clearly it&#039;s a known issue.&nbsp; Can anyone help us out?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Matt</p>									</div>

					<p>Same issue here as well. All clients disconnect after about 1-6 hours, its quite random. What logs can I view to see what&#039;s going on? My only resolution has been to power cycle the router.</p>									</div>
