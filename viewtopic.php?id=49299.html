					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;d like to ask OpenWRT developers, if they see kdbus [1] usable for OpenWRT as alternative/replacement to ubus?</p><p>From my simple point of view it seems really performance focused and not-yet-bloated, but I&#039;m totally not sure if it&#039;s usable for OpenWRT.</p><p>Thank you for info <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />David</p><p>[1] <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/580194/">https://lwn.net/Articles/580194/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Super bump here, but I wanted to reply.</p><p>I&#039;m not an OpenWrt developer, but if I had to take a guess, I would say quite confidently that kdbus could not be a replacement for ubus.</p><p>First, kdbus is not portable in any way. Ubus runs fine on my FreeBSD box.&nbsp; OpenWrt is a Linux distribution, but that doesn&#039;t mean developing non-portable software is a great idea.<br />Second, dbus itself is a convoluted protocol which really begs for high-level language bindings. Using dbus from C is a pain... even with systemd cleaning things up it&#039;s still a pain. Kdbus isn&#039;t really addressing this problem.<br />Third, ubus is way easy to use from the shell and from Lua. That can not be said about dbus.</p><p>The reason why dbus had to be made faster was because it&#039;s a heavy protocol. Generating and parsing messages is an intensive process. It was also severely misused and abused by application developers, to the point where IPC became a bottleneck. Ubus and OpenWrt developers do not suffer from these problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>couldn resist to add my 2cnts about my ubus experience in OWRT trunk, trying not to exagerrate into a rant</p><p>1. ubus development and implementation has been done together with major redesign of central functions in OWRT<br />which led to all sorts of problems in related functions </p><p>2. there is little or no documentation of ubus i could find as of today ( which is true for OWRT in general)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This is really bad for a community driven project like OWRT. Even to gather basic information in order to develop a decent&nbsp; wiki artikel is cumbersome at least.</p><p>3. underlaying message structure is highly verbose json ( Java script object notation ) and by no way easy to parse with ash shell script, so there is a dire need of a decent slim &amp; fast json parser</p><p>4. using LUA to deal with this is just another layer of bloat ( cpu-load/memory/knowledge )</p><p>5. at the moment all this json-handling renders small&nbsp; systems useless until there has been a major improvement of implementaion in handling all json related system messaging.</p><p>In general i do really miss informations about the overall structure of the messaging system inside OWRT for now and the future. ( but that maybe developers politics )</p><br /><p>to illustrate the practical outcome of json related parsing , trace a simple script like :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    . /usr/share/libubox/jshn.sh
    json_load &quot;$(ubus call network.interface.lan status)&quot; #get real interface(device) -&gt;br-lan 
     json_get_var my_device device</code></pre></div><p> or&nbsp; &nbsp; /lib/functions/network.sh&nbsp; network_get_ipaddr</p><p> compared to a simple </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>       set -- $(ip -o -4 addr list $_dev);echo ${4%%/*}&quot; &quot;${13%%/*}    </code></pre></div><p>the difference on cpu/memory load is HUGE</p><p>at the end i started to rewrite most of these bload-json-functions to be able to use OWRT on my 4MB/16MB CPE&#039;s</p><p>working on OWRT would be so much more effective if the information flow from the developers wouldnt be such a small &#039;rinse&#039; (sigh)</p><p>&lt;&lt;EOF rant</p><p>regards<br />3zl</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>3zl</strong> on 30 Apr 2014, 08:34)</p>

					<p>For extracting json keys on the cli you can use the &quot;jsonpath&quot; utility.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ubus call network.interface.lan status | jsonpath -e &#039;@[&quot;ipv4-address&quot;][0].address&#039;

					<p>Hi jow and&nbsp; thank you for your input which is highly appreciated.</p><p>I will have a deeper look at the jsonpath utility which i came across as python script some time ago.</p><p>If you do have some ideas where one can find some more insight into the OWRT structures, please let me know.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>regards<br />3zl</p>									</div>
