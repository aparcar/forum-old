					<p>Until now I&#039;m using a Netgear WNDR4300v1 with OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 and I&#039;m quite happy with that. My internet access was 100 MBit/s (bidirectional) and I was able to fully use that bandwidth.</p><p>Now my provider made an upgrade to 300 MBit/s. With the router, the provider gives me, I was able to fully utilize that. I tested with speedtest between an ethernet LAN port and the ethernet WAN port. But with the WNDR4300 I get &quot;only&quot; about 160 MBit/s.</p><p>For the moment that&#039;s more than enough speed. But in the long term I&#039;d like to upgrade my router. Any ideas, what model will give that performance with OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>TP-Link WDR4900 since it has a really good CPU so even without NAT acceleration it can make use of that speed.</p><p>More suggestions welcome.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just did an update of the WNDR4300v1 to LEDE 17.01.0 and now I get 260 MBit/s on speedtest. That&#039;s near enough to the 300 MBit/s from my provider, so no new hardware. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
