					<p>Hi,</p><p>I tried an OpenWRT image (kamikaze, ar525w) from early September 2007 on my belkin as they use similar hardware. The good news: I could boot the router into OpenWRT and was able to setup a PPPoE connection. However:<br />- the changes I made in the config files (or the password) were not stored. So after a reboot I had to start over again.<br />- DNS worked on the clients but the bridging between lan and wan seemed to be somehow broken</p><p>Are these known issues? I have the impression that the second one affected other platforms (non-rdc) in the past.</p><p>In order to check the latest builds I downloaded the kamikaze trunk from svn. The build stopped in the rt2x00 module saying that CFLAGS were overwritten by the Makefile and advised to use EXTRA_CFLAGS instead.</p><p>Any ideas on how to fix the compile error?</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>I desperately need better firmware for my F5D9230-4(ver.3100) I know nothing of compiling or the such... is there a way to download this code already compiled? I am capable of following installation instructions and for the most part am pretty tech savvy... I just have no programing experience or experience with compiling any code... if anyone could help... I would GREATLY appreciate it!</p><p>_benjammin</p><p>P.S. I have checked the other site DD-WRT and haven&#039;t found anything where anyone has claimed any success on this model, and posted here as it seems someone here has!</p><p>P.P.S. I&#039;m sorry if I have totally misunderstood what this project is, I assumed with the topic name this has to do with the belkin F5D9230 wireless router and it&#039;s firmware. Forgive me if I&#039;m way off here.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>benjamminzIS</strong> on 22 Apr 2008, 17:50)</p>
