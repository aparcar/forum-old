					<p>it began yesterday.<br />out of the blue i had no internet connection.<br />i know it&#039;s the router, because i could(and still am) connect via my modem Directly(as i connected now).<br />after i turn the router off and pluged it in again, i still didn&#039;t have an internet connection and also my WLAN bulb was shut off.<br />after i pluged it off and on again, suddenly i had an internet connection and also the WLAN was working.<br />everything was working good again.</p><p>today it happened again, but after couple of minutes the internet connection returned.<br />i decided to do a sys upgrade, thinking maybe it will solve this thing.<br />so i cd /tmp and wget the latest snapshot, and using mtd i did a sysupgrade.<br />everything was working good(so i think).<br />after the upgrade was done, the router automatically reboot itself.</p><p>now i don&#039;t have internet connection.<br />the WLAN is not working(the bulb is shut off), and i can&#039;t get into luci.<br />i get an error when i try to get into 192.168.1.1</p><p>i can only get into the router using SSH, but i don&#039;t know what to do further.</p><p>can anyone help me?</p><p>p.s.<br />all the other bulbs on the router are working good.<br />the sys, wan, lan, usb, and pwr are working.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sholizar</strong> on 16 Jun 2013, 09:46)</p>

Now you don&#039;t have Luci - install it from repositories if you want or just reflash via SSH. <br />Just revert back to AA 12.09<br />I&#039;ve created a ticket <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13696">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13696</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sppmaster</strong> on 13 Jun 2013, 15:54)</p>

					<p>thanks mate :-).<br />i have an update.<br />i managed to connect my self to the internet using this guide:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection</a></p><p>after i had a connection, i installed luci-SSL and could get into it on the browser.<br />by the way, it&#039;s the new luci and it looks very good :-).</p><p>now i tried to restore my configuration file, but after i did that, the router rebooted and i have a problem to get into luci again.<br />now i get this error when i try to get into luci(192.168.1.1):</p><p>/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:284: No valid theme found<br />stack traceback:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [C]: in function &#039;assert&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:284: in function &#039;dispatch&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:195: in function &lt;/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:194&gt;</p><br /><p>P.S.<br />everything else is working good.<br />i have a wireless connection, so i think that the configuration file was restored OK(i have a wpa2-psk password in the wireless, and it worked good out of the box after restoring the configuration file), but maybe it has a problem to get into luci, because i restored configuration file that was made by older version of luci, into a latest version of luci(?)</p><p>please help :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sholizar</strong> on 13 Jun 2013, 12:48)</p>
