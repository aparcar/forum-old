					<p>My setup:<br />- Public Wifi HotSpot which i can successfuly connect to with my Laptop.<br />- 2x TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v11 / OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 r49208 / LuCI for-15.05 branch (git-16.090.31416-605d1f1)</p><p>What i want to achive:<br />[Hotspot] --(WLAN)--&gt; [TP-Link1] --(WLAN)--&gt; [TP-Link2] --(Ethernet)--&gt; PC with DHCP IP from [TP-Link1] and Internet from [Hotspot]</p><br /><p>TP-Link1 is sucessfuly connect to Hotspot. I&#039;ve created an WLAN Accesspoint(WDS) named OpenWRT in the network &quot;LAN&quot;<br />The gateway of Interface LAN(br-lan) was set to Hotspot IP and is a bridge between eth0 and OpenWRT.<br />With this setup I receive an IP from TP-Link1 and Internet is workin via Ethernet and Wifi.</p><p>Now i&#039;m trying to connect TP-Link2 to TP-Link1. I tried the recipe for an Dump Accesspoint&nbsp; but it&#039;s not working for me.<br />For the LAN interface on TP-Link2 i set Static IP to 192.168.1.2<br />I connected via Wifi to TP-Link1 in Client(WDS) mode. Created another WLAN Accesspoint named OpenWRT2 and bridged the interface LAN(br-lan) the same way as for TP-Link1.</p><p>And that&#039;s the point where I&#039;m stuck now. My PC got an IP from TP-Link2 but i&#039;ve no Internet and i cannot reach TP-Link1</p><p>If i enable Masquerading in Firewall settings for zone LAN on TP-Link2 i&#039;ve Internet but cannot reach TP-Link1 webinterface.</p><p>Configs are here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/x5p9hVEE">pastebin.com/x5p9hVEE</a></p><p>I hope you can help me. Many thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, sys00</p><p>I guess you neither can ping your TP-Link1 nor the internet (from TP-Link2 or your laptop), right?<br />In any case I would recommend you to put a gateway in the TP-Link2 network config:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.2&#039;
option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
...</code></pre></div><p>To test if you can ping the internet use:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ping 8.8.8.8</code></pre></div><p>(Its the google dns server)<br />If you can ping now the internet but cannot browse any webside you also need to put an dns after the gateway e.g.:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option dns &#039;8.8.8.8&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Hopefully the internet should now work normally on your laptop.</p><p>Now you can think about the the dhcp thing you mentioned.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>benny.1337</strong> on 16 Sep 2017, 19:42)</p>

					<p>Hi benny,<br />thanks for reply.</p><p>As i&#039;ve written i have access to internet (and can ping google dns of course) if i enable Masquerading in TP-Link2.<br />Setting 192.168.1.1 as gateway has no effect.</p>									</div>

					<p>So you need active Masquerading in TP-Link2? Or would it be ok to have Masquerading in TP-Link1 only?</p><p>I was assuming you enabled Masquerading in TP-Link2 only for testing. Can you ping the internet when Masquerading&nbsp; is off in TP-Link2 (after setting the gateway)?</p><p>Tomorrow I&#039;ll try to rebuild your setup, maybe it&#039;s only a firewall config problem...</p>									</div>

					<p>Turn off the DHCP server in unit 2.&nbsp; </p><p>That one is a simple bridge between the STA(WDS), its local AP, and your Ethernet users.&nbsp; All routing and DHCP is handled by unit 1.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 Sep 2017, 18:36)</p>
