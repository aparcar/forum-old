					<p>I also have WRT350N v2 and wireless is not working completely. In luci I can see that my radio is at 0dBm signal and wireless clients can not connect to the router although most of the time even SSID disappears. This started somewhere between rc4 and rc5 as in rc4 G mode was stable. N mode worked but was not stable. Now I can&#039;t connect even if G mode is used. And disabling wireless security does not change anything as well.&nbsp; I have an accepted ticket (#9882) in tracker and I am hoping to be able to use my router as a wireless N router some day.</p>									</div>

					<p>Best OpenWrt member to contact about W-LAN issues is nbd.<br />He also has a WRT350N v2 at his proposal (was a donation by me, hence I know).</p><p>Edit:<br />Just recognized that nbd accepted slowmo&#039;s ticket <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9882">#9882</a>. Added myself to CC to get updated (I think it is possible to add mail addresses too).</p><p>Edit 2:<br />Hint: Always describe exactly with which devices you connect (brand, model, version, firmware), what your W-LAN settings are and what&#039;s your router (brand, model, version, firmware revision, trunk or backfire).<br />With some luck one of the developers is able to recreate the issue, which increases the chances to get it fixed.<br />Additionally it helps to know how to compile the latest trunk for your device to quickly test fixes, and how to revive your device after a bad flash (e.g. serial connection).

					<p>Hi all,<br />Ever since I tried to upgrade to <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/backfire?rev=30807">10.03.1 r30807</a> I&#039;ve got a strange problem:<br />Every time I reboot my wrt350n, wireless and network settings revert back to original one, resulting in no wifi and no wan! I did everything I could, compiled and recompiled the images, flash the image using the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt350nv2#download.mode">Download Mode</a> but still no chance. Things get weird sometimes, for example if I update the image using the web interface without selecting &quot;keep setting&quot;, after reboot, my previous password is set! even some of the packages that were in the previous image (but has not been selected in the new image) are there! I thought it is a problem of that revision, so I downgraded to original 10.03.1 image (which I was happily using for at least a week&nbsp; before these strange things started to happen,) but still no luck, the problem persists!<br />Would you please help me!<br />Is there anyway that I may have corrupted the EEPROM? (for example by flashing&nbsp; a squashfs image about 4.4M size?)<br />I don&#039;t know whether it is relevant&nbsp; or not but after every boot, at the end of the logs I get the following message:<br /><strong>user.info sysinit: copying files ... done</strong><br />It seems the message is from one of the files in the /lib/firstboot/40_copy_ramoverlay or /lib/firstboot/40_no_fo_copy_ramoverlay.<br />Can somebody please enlighten me on /lib/firstboot? Isn&#039;t it suppose to be run only at first boot, and not after that?<br />Is there any problems with the <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/backfire/package/block-extroot?rev=30807">block-extroot</a> package in this release? The reason I&#039;m asking is that after I flashed an image with this package selected as a built in, these problems started to happen! <br />Thank you for your help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sasanj</strong> on 13 Mar 2012, 15:09)</p>

					<p>That &quot;.release+ipv6-luci&quot; is a naming convention for my own builds, so I know that it is an OpenWrt release build (all trunk packages) with IPv6 enabled and Luci web interface removed.</p><br /><p>For Orion the sysupgrade images are the ones without any special mark:<br />* &quot;-webupgrade&quot; = for flashing via stock firmware<br />* &quot;-recovery&quot; = for flashing via download mode<br />* no &quot;extension&quot; with a dash = normal sysupgrade image (either via console or OpenWrt web interface)</p><br /><p>Did you build the other images yourself? Or downloaded from OpenWrt downloads area?<br />If A then backup your source downloads and do a distclean (<a href="ftp://ftp.maddes.net/maddes.net/openwrt/bin/distclean_build.sh">my script</a> for this), then rebuild.<br />If B then post a bug on <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/">TRAC</a> (put your mail address in CC, mention your name, Router, Platform, trunk/backfire, revision, issue, log from serial console and so on) or on IRC.</p><p>Maddes</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maddes.b</strong> on 7 Jul 2012, 20:45)</p>

I don&#039;t know in which change set the mv-cesa-module is introduced but there where some rename-tickets that renamed the module form mv_cesa to mv-cesa. Unfortunately, the module isn&#039;t built in the latest stable but it is in the latest nightlies. I want to use this little device as and IPSec-endpoint for my iPhone, that&#039;s why I&#039;m interested in that module.</p><p>Somewhere earlier in this topic, this modules also has been mentioned.
