					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need some help.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a wgt634u and I&#039;m trying to install a custom rootfs &amp; kernel to its flash.&nbsp; I can flash the kernel fine, but when I come to flash the rootfs I get an out of disk space error.&nbsp; I checked the size of the mtdblock partitions and they look a little odd, the kernel one (block2) is 3072 (blocks (approx 3mb)) and the rootfs (mtdblock3) one is 4480 (approx 3.9mb).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>From what I can find out from google it seems that mtdblock2 was originallu 1.2mb and mtdblock3 was approx 6mb.&nbsp; I do not know why or how this has changed.</p><p>I realise the the mtd devices are not proper block devices.&nbsp; I also realise that the partitioning information is fed to the kernel from somewhere (CFE?).&nbsp; My question is how do I re-partition (or re-set the environment variables) to allow me to modify the partition sizes.&nbsp; I know this is possible because the OpenWRT port to the wgt634u shows different partition sizes during the kernel boot. </p><p>Does anyone know how I can change the size of these partitions.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Rob-ix</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like your kernel has the wrong mtd partitions hardcoded.</p><p>Hook up a serial console and flash your kernel and rootfs from CFE.</p><p>BTW: Next time you hop onto irc to ask questions, you may want to stay around long enough to get your answers. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>peteru</strong> on 28 Sep 2005, 08:21)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the information.</p><p>I was just about to reply asking where I could find this hardcoding when I thought I should have a good grep around the kernel.&nbsp; Lo and behold I stumbled over the information, I think next time I&#039;ll grep before posting ;-)</p><p>For anyone who is interested they are defined in: linux/drivers/mtd/maps/bcm47xx-flash.c (thinking about it this should have fairly obvious to me).</p><p>&gt;&nbsp; BTW: Next time you hop onto irc to ask questions, you may want to stay around long enough to get your answers. wink</p><p>My Internet connection was coming through the wgt634u via a USB ADSL modem using a rootfs &amp; kernel supplied by my main machine, unfortunately I managed to completely lose connectivity by playing with iptables on the wgt (ie it lost the internet and the nfs root partition).&nbsp; Next time I&#039;ll a lurk for a few days waiting for a response ;-)</p>									</div>
