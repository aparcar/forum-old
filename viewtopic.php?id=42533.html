					<p>Hi,<br />I build an image from trunk for the Asus RT-N-16 with Target System &quot;Broadcom BCM947xx/953xx&quot; and Target Profile &quot;Broadcom SoC, all Ethernet, BCM43xx WiFi (wl, proprietary)&quot;. The image was building fine and I put it onto the box. Everything is working except wireless 802.11n. I had a look at openwrt&#039;s broadcom page (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.broadcom.bcm47xx ) and tried to configure the wifi device with the &quot;wl&quot; utility, but the utility itself allowed only to set rates up to 54 MBit. I can set the 40 Mhz channel width, but no higher rates than 54 MBit. Did anyone get wireless 802.11n working with the proprietary &quot;wl&quot; broadcom-wl driver?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you can already download the sdk from Asus website.
