					<p>First, I am a complete n00b to OpenWRT, so be gentle.</p><p>Here&#039;s the situation, I flashed my WRT350N v2 with Karmikaze because the default firmware was crap. I successfully flashed the firmware via the web interface and viola, OpenWRT worked and looked all splendid.</p><p>Eager to configure my router I began changing network settings to allow my router to get an internet connection via the WAN port (I couldn&#039;t get it to connect properly) and also get the wifi working.</p><p>Anyway, strait to the punch: I must have changed a network setting that led to my router not accepting connections from the LAN ports, but I only found out about my error after I rebooted the router and I could not connect.</p><p>The Power/LAN LEDs fire up perfectly, which leads me to believe that the firmware is still working, just completely inaccessible by me.</p><p>I have attempted the failsafe mode and I can get the blinking power LED but I still cannot connect via Telnet with the following settings:</p><p>My IP: 192.168.1.50<br />Router&#039;s Gateway address: 192.168.1.1 (I cannot ping 192.168.1.1 under any circumstances)<br />Subnet: 255.255.255.0</p><p>As a noob I fear I have bricked my router as the failsafe mode does not work and I have exhausted all of my options, as such I am posting here and can anyone that knows about this help me. router specs below:</p><p>WRT350N v2<br />CPU: Marvell Orion 88F5181 500MHz<br />RAM: 16MB 200MHz SDRAM<br />Flash: Samsung k8d6316utm 8MB<br />Wireless: Atheros AR5008<br />JTAG: yes</p>									</div>

					<p>I found this referenced in the DD-WRT peacock thread for recovering routers and thought it may be the easiest recovery if it works.</p><p>Pay attention to eko&#039;s instructions in post # 7 of this thread and how other Linksys owners with bricked routers responded: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=54286">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=54286</a></p><p>So far it has worked with a couple of 610&#039;s and a 310 but I noticed one poster replied saying that he had flashed a micro build during his recovery which is not advised with N routers in DD-WRT. Eko was not limiting flash to DD-WRT, any valid f/w would work but the peacock thread advises the factory flash to recover a bricked router first then third party f/w if successful.</p><p>I don&#039;t have a Linksys but I think the flashing power LED would be an indication that you had successfully reached a recovery mode to flash, being that you may have locked out one or more LAN ports, I thought of two suggestions. One would be to try to access the recovery using all LAN ports in separate sequential attempts, but two, your comment about the LAN not being accessible brought a recall of the above comments by eko, &quot;Timing is crucial. And some routers I&#039;ve seen must NOT have any lan cable plugged in for this to work. Plug it only after you released reset button.&quot;</p><p>BTW, if you get OpenWrt working again, I think the only thing you need to do is enable and configure wireless. The default settings IIRC are preset for router configuration and may only require you to power down the modem for 3 minutes and bring it up to ready mode before powering the router. My TWC ISP using dynamic IP and OpenWrt has worked better than anything I tried before as far as initiating an INTERNET connection and issuing DHCP addresses to all my devices. I can flash latest trunk snapshot, telnet in to install packages, and IP into webui and browse INTERNET without having to touch my router or modem! My managed gigabit switch is configured to my liking, so my last flash to OpenWrt, I decided to try to forego the Qos, Luci and configuration and all seems better so far but I&#039;m not using any wireless either.</p><p>Hope that helps and credit eko if it works. If you need the peacock thread, here&#039;s the link: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=51486">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=51486</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>armchair</strong> on 1 Mar 2010, 09:39)</p>

					<p>You may also try disabling firewall on PC and use Internet Explorer; I&#039;ve seen several replies stating Firefox, Google Chrome and firewall were prohibiting flash or recovery of router.</p><p>Always use a static IP address on PC to flash, hard reset (303030) before and after flash and don&#039;t rush the reset after flash; give it several minutes to stabilize NVRAM.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, I may not be any further help for you but I would recommend setting your PC network to static IP 192.168.1.10 and do hard reset (30-30-30second of holding reset button in three stages of power on/off/on all while holding reset button) try eko&#039;s timing suggestion with different variations of timing. Did you try to limit speed of connection as described in the last post of the first thread I referenced? Read and test the router via the peacock thread and follow those suggestions. Maybe that idea was a long shot and falls under the test category of: &quot;Is my router bricked or not?&quot;</p><p>The only other thing I can think of that maybe the gateway address was changed and that&#039;s why you can&#039;t ping it. Try setting your PC network to obtain IP automatically and try to get the router to obtain INTERNET connection by doing the hard reset, then power it down. Remove power from your modem and wait three minutes (TWC even recommends removing cable from router during this time). Apply power to modem and wait for ready light before applying power to router and watch to see if power LED will acknowledge an INTERNET connection (mine goes from a yellow flashing light during power on/boot to flashing green light while trying to get dynamic IP from ISP, then finally solid green when INTERNET connection is established). This should all be done with wired WAN/LAN connection, no wireless.</p><p>If you manage an INTERNET connection, open Command Prompt and Enter ipconfig/all. That will reveal all your settings. An IP of 192.168.x.x is active Internet connectiwhile an IP of 169.x.x.x means no DHCP address was issued most likely due to no INTERNET connection established.</p><p>Maybe it&#039;s time for a JTAG but I have no experience in that regard. I was trying to help with the basics.</p><p>Maybe describing in detail your observations while this is happening will help.</p>									</div>
