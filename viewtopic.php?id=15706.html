					<p>I was running 0.9 on a WRT54G. I bought a Netgear WGT634U because it had external USB storage. I&#039;ve finally gotten all that set up with Kamikaze on the netgear and a little 5GB seagate drive I had mounted to /opt.</p><p>On my linksys, I was mounting external storage across the network from an ubuntu box, and I was installing various software from the backports package group. Here&#039;s my question:</p><p>1. How did I do that? I&#039;ve had this running for so long that, for the life of me, I can&#039;t remember how I set that up. I remember there was a separate ipkg file installed, and that it would install everything to /opt, which is where I had my network share mounted. But I can&#039;t seem to find any of the documentation I must have used to get that going.<br />2. Will the backports packages work with Kamikaze?</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>									</div>
