					<p>Hi, </p><p>I am using OpenWrt as an bridged AP to access the internet via vpn and certain services on my host router. I followed the instructions in this howto: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap</a></p><p>The host router IP is 192.168.100.1. The IP of the brigdged lan is 192.168.100.2.</p><p>What kind of configuration is necessary to access OpenWrt via SSH from my connected WLAN client. I know this is generally more a network related topic but it would be awesome to get some hints.</p><p>Sorry for my ugly english <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Regards<br />RR</p>									</div>

uci set network.lan.gateway=192.168.100.1
uci set dhcp.lan.ignore=1
uci commit</code></pre></div><p>will:<br />- set the openwrt IP to 192.168.100.2<br />- use gateway 192.168.100.1<br />- disable dhcpd on your openwrt box</p><p>You can still do more (like disable the WAN interface and add it to the internal switch depending on your model).<br />The link you posted is a bit outdated (for an older openwrt version), maybe take a look here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a></p><p>To allow ssh, just set a password. Setting one will&nbsp; enable your dropbear sshd.<br />After rebooting you can&nbsp; ssh to root@192.168.100.2 to access your openwrt box.</p>									</div>
