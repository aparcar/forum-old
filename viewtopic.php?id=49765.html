					<p>Hello:</p><p>I am new to networking/openwrt and would love to get some help for my current scenario.</p><p>Current setup:<br />- I am using TL-WR841N flashed with the latest openwrt build. (previously dd-wrt)<br />- I have 2 ssids.<br />- &#039;ssid-normal&#039; 192.168.1.0/24<br />- &#039;ssid-us&#039; 192.168.2.0/24<br />- &#039;ssid-us&#039; dns servers are pointed unlocator.com&#039;s dns 185.37.37.37</p><p>---</p><p>What I would like to achieve:<br />- Both ssids to be on the same network segment 192.168.1.0/24<br />- Devices on &#039;ssid-normal&#039; would have their dns servers point those my isp provide<br />- Devices on &#039;ssid-us&#039; would have their dns servers point to unlocator.com&#039;s dns 185.37.37.37</p><p>---</p><p>Why do I want this:<br />- I want devices on both ssids to be able to see/broadcast to each other.<br />- In the current setup, deivces from the different ssids can ping each other but cannot see/broadcast to each other.</p><p>---</p><p>Why do I really want this:<br />- I have a chromecast on &#039;ssid-us&#039;<br />- To cast netflix from my device to the chromecast, I need the device to be on &#039;ssid-us&#039; which is fine.<br />- But I would like to cast youtube from any device on any ssid to the chormecast and since youtube is not region locked, I do not want to use unlocator.com&#039;s dns.</p><p>---</p><p>What I have tried so far and failed:<br />- Googling shows examples only where the 2 ssids on on different networks only.<br />- Otherwise googling shows the setup with additional hardware.<br />- The problem is I can&#039;t identify which clients are on &#039;ssid-us&#039;<br />- I have tried to use the vap interface name (which is a big no no)<br />- I have tried creating a bridge with no ip assigned, attach that bridge to &#039;ssid-us&#039; and try to assign a dhcp range to the brdige but the device was not assigned an IP.<br />- I have tired to set &#039;ssid-normal&#039; to 192.168.1.0/25 and &#039;ssid-us&#039; to to 192.168.1.200/25 but now realise that is pointless as well as they are still in different segments.<br />- I have tried having 2 dhcp-ranges on the same network of 192.168.1.0/24, &#039;ssid-normal&#039; from 50-99 and &#039;ssid-us&#039; from &#039;150-199&#039; but the router goes wonky and won&#039;t assign any IP at all. (I think this is the best bet though)</p><p>---</p><p>Thing is I don&#039;t even need the 2 ssids to be on the same segment. I just need all devices to be able to see the chromecast.</p><p>Any suggestions? Is what I am looking to do even possible?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
