					<p>I have been evaluating if openwrt can be used on my asus rt-n16 routers.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I&#039;m currently using Tomato USB.)</p><p>One show stopper I ran into is there doesn&#039;t seem to be a way to underclock the routers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of my two Asus RT-N16 one runs stable at the default 480 MHz clock rate.&nbsp; The other needs to be dropped by 10% to run reliably.&nbsp; &nbsp;Otherwise it crashes at least once a day.</p><p>It looks like with older versions of openwrt, one can use an nvram command just like tomato USB to accomplish this.&nbsp; But there does not seem to be such an obvious solution for builds of openwrt which work on the Asus RT-N16.</p>									</div>
