					<p>Hi roger_, <br />It is possibly a current issue, the camera I have is the autofocus&nbsp; &quot;voice-coil&quot; type. I do not know of the current draw<br />but USB ports on routers are current starved in my opinion.<br />A capacitor should help but there are many variables.</p><p>tmo26&#039;s table seems comprehensive. I have not tried the range and types of cameras listed.</p><p>I use the web cam up to10 fps on the single USB port and no issues. No powered hub. It is a wireless link several hundred feet from my server through at least two repeated hops.</p><p>I store a picture on a server taken every 20 seconds. Each picture is roughly 300 KB in size.</p>									</div>

Maybe it&#039;s a kernel issue after all.</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>This is because the usb had capacitors on the power lines, usually, capacitors store energy and this energy is used by the usb camera when it need more power from power line, without the capacitors, when the cams need more power (voice coil activated) it demands from the power line, this power cames from the usb connector, the power line of the usb connector in this router is controlled by a transistor, this transtistor is inside the hub (gpio 8 (tplink mr-3020) to control power for the usb port), the transistor is not perfect, so, if you demand more power from the transistor its resistance increments, so the voltage drops, the same may occur up to the power source, the good designs should use capacitors in the power lines near the chips or the devices that most power take, in this case, the problem must be the camera, it should have a capacitor with enough capacitance to provide a good power for the coil. Is a basic in electronics, but my english is soooo poor that I can&#039;t explain better.</p><p>Regards<br />Luis</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LuisR</strong> on 1 Aug 2014, 16:59)</p>
