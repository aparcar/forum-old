					<p>Hello there! </p><p>I just purchased my v4 and I wanted to install OpenWRT to VPN at the router level.<br />The trouble is, I literally learned that custom firmware-ing routers is a thing one day ago.</p><p>I&#039;m my family&#039;s IT guy, but i know enough to say i have no knowledge on anything IT.<br />and until about 1 hour ago, I thought I at least knew how to google and follow instructions.</p><p>I originally wanted to DD-WRT my router as suggested by my VPN provider, but I learned that v4 is not supported yet. Mighty google helped me reach here.<br />I then downloaded the *factory.bin* and *sysupgrade.bin* as directed on this thread, and following the instructions I installed &#039;factory.bin&#039; by going to my router&#039;s admin ip address. </p><p>That was 1 hour ago, and my router is booting, and the WAN (the UFO icon) is lit, probably because it&#039;s plugged in and the LED is hardwired... but no other icons are lit. <br />I can&#039;t find the SSID either. I haven&#039;t tried plugging in LAN cable directly into it yet, but I suspect that wont&#039; do much either? </p><p>Have I bricked the device? Is there anything I can do at this point?<br />Please advise<br />THanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are really booting into OpenWrt, every time you power up, the system &quot;gear&quot; icon LED should blink fast then slow then stay on steady.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t do that it&#039;s probably bricked.&nbsp; The LED for the LAN port you&#039;re using should come on when you plug in your computer.</p>									</div>

The WAN LED stays on. LAN LED isn&#039;t on even though it&#039;s plugged in. i&#039;ve tried different ports and PC recognises that it&#039;s been plugged in, but can&#039;t get internet acces. So system LED and WAN LED is the only ports that are lit on the router side.</p>									</div>
