					<p>Forgot that fq_codel is on by default in Barrier Breaker, but QoS or SQM still needs to be installed, configured, and enabled (in two places!) to make it actually work.

Then fq_codel will be able to work as expected. Ideally we would get fq_codel or something similar into modems and slams but that is not very likely happening soon, if at all.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HansomPeerClown wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Are you using either IPv6 or an oldish ADSL link?</p></blockquote></div><p>IPv4 bridged ADSL2+ modem into my wireless router.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So with all likelihood you will be using an ATM link, you might want to have a look at the link-layer adjustment tab on sqm-scripts then. Select ATM as link layer and fill in the per packet overhead on your link, typically 40, sometimes 44 bytes. (Often you can figure this out empirically, but that takes several hours of measurement, so start out worth setting this to 44 to get started.)<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HansomPeerClown wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If any of those is true you might have better luck with running sqm-scripts instead of qos-scripts.

Individual flows will have to pay a bandwidth price, since after all you only have so much bandwidth available and need to divide it between all flows somehow. That said the cumulative bandwidth of all flows should still almost max out the shaped bandwidth. Note that with link layer adaptation the effective bandwidth will be lower, as this option takes the full on dal-wire size of your packets into account...<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>HansomPeerClown wrote:</cite><blockquote><p><strong>I&#039;m assuming</strong> this is correlated and I need to configure sqm-scripts to give me more bandwidth for higher latency.&nbsp; <br />My sqm-scripts config is this <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config queue &#039;eth1&#039;

But in the end your bandwidth is limited and if sufficient flows count as sparse you will need to round robin (well almost fq_codel uses something DRR-derived but in essence that is still true) through those and your important flows will encounter delay.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That said, you could try to set your shaped bandwidth lower and see how things behave then. Sometimes the link speed is not actually what is limiting your connection, in my case for example my ISP DTAG in Germany uses a throttle in the BRAS to artificially limit my bandwidth below the values reported as actual sync values by my modem, requiring me to set my shaper according to the artificial throttle to actually constrain latency under load. I would be very interested if you could run netperf-wrapper&#039;s RRUL test on your link. (I would like to see whether this should the latency under load increase you see in your real life testing, if so it could be a good tool to try to tune the shaper bandwidth). Alternatively, or better as a first test you could try to install Rich Brown&#039;s betterspeedtest.sh (from: <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Quick_Test_for_Bufferbloat)">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cer … fferbloat)</a> and netperf on your router and then test upload and download independently. The issue is that if even one of the shapers is configured to high latency under load is going to suffer, so testing them independently can help. I used:<br />./betterspeedtest.sh -4 -H netperf-eu.bufferbloat.net -t 150 -p netperf-eu.bufferbloat.net -n 4 ; ./netperfrunner.sh -4 -H netperf-eu.bufferbloat.net -t 150 -p netperf-eu.bufferbloat.net -n 4</p><p>successfully in the past to assess uplink and downlink sequentially and the simultaneously, but note this requires netperf installed on the machine running the test.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I very much would lie to figure out why sqm-scripts do not seem to work well on yor link, so I hope you persevere...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

But if the issues are gone and the system now behaves under load there probably is no need to install netperf (and for testing you can always install it on a computer in your LAN and run a test through the router, but if latency under load is now constrained, all is well, I hope).
