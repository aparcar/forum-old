					<p>Same for me. Serial port not working.&nbsp; I flashed and bricked my 703n. The sticker say 1.6.

Enable WiFi as default. With some measures to activate it . Ie. It only activates automativaly if You plug something in to the USB port. Like memory stick, USB-seriall or a bluetooth dongle, what ever.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>nullBoundary wrote:</cite><blockquote><p> ...</p><p>5.

Is there something fatally wrong with it, or did something go wrong when I flashed it? I am dying to know whats going on with this router, I really want to see the dmesg output. I have bricked them before and usually they don&#039;t boot, and can&#039;t enter failsafe, but this one can do both, but is still unreachable. The serial port is the most frustrating because that is almost guaranteed to work. Its always possible I soldered it wrong, but my multimeter says the connections are good, and it looks good to me.

					<p>The serial console is working at 115200 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no hardware/software flow control, but I bet you already checked that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Be carefull too, the TL-WR703N&#039;s AR9331 SoC GPIOs are 2.7V only, NOT 3.3V, and this of course includes the UART signals.

IMHO you cannot read english.</p><p>i quote the old wiki:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>It has been reported that <strong>models shipped with a recent factory firmware onboard (Build 120925)</strong> come with a new bootloader revision which disables the LAN port at boot. A fix has NOT YET been implemented in trunk. Below is the version of the new bootloader (which disables the LAN port) <strong>of a version 1.7 hardware model</strong> (bought in December 2012).</p><p>root@tpl2:~# grep -a U-Boot /dev/mtd0ro | cut -d&#039;I&#039; -f1<br />U-Boot 1.1.4 (Sep 25 2012 - 09:04:47)</p><p>We are Working on a workaround for routers loaded with the newer firmware, to restore old bootloader BEFORE flashing openwrt. In the meantime stick with stock firmware if you do not have access to serial console.</p></blockquote></div><p>Please tell me exactly in what sentence you read that:<br />a) 1.6 was safe to flash.<br />b) 1.7 was not.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
