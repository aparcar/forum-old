					<p>hi,</p><p>i will install openwrt on an CA8 router, it shiped with the AR bootloader. Now i have installed the oswave firmware to get redboot, but this is not the &quot;full&quot;&nbsp; redboot&nbsp; loader because many commands not exist. <br />Now i have only access to the bootloader (oswave redboot loader) because i have tried some things and now the firmware is erased.</p><p>can anyone send me a file that i can upload in the oswave loader (fis, load, still exist) to geht this thing running and install redboot?</p><p>thanks....</p>									</div>
