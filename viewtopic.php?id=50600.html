					<p>I am experiencing serious WAN connection problems on my new WDR4300 v1.6 both under 12.09 as well as with 3 trunk releases from the last week: With stock firmware I do get the maximum bandwidth possible with my connection (75Mbit/sec) and a stable connection. With all tested OpenWRT releases in default config (also tested DD-WRT &amp; Gargoyle - same issue) speed reaches the 75Mbit/sec slowly followed by connection drops on both wired and wireless connections to the router. Problem persists when testing on the router (iperf, wget, iftop). I have already ruled out the hardware NAT problem (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11779">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11779</a>) as an issue here, since 75Mbit/sec should be doable even on software NAT. Didn&#039;t experience any packet loss when issuing standard pings against some servers. Speed would not be that much of a problem without those connection drops (they suck for gaming), forcing me back to stock firmware. I am desperate to finally get OpenWRT going to fulfill the routers&nbsp; true destiny ;-).<br />Looking forward to hearing some help/advice !</p>									</div>
