					<p>Hello. I tried to install kamikaze 8.09 in my WAG54GP2. I use tftp to send firmware. After that linksys don&#039;t boot - power led blink on green, lan port is green. I can&#039;t ping device. I tried to reset device to factory defaults but reset button don&#039;t work. How can i downgrade firmware to original linksys firmware?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nixau</strong> on 11 Jan 2009, 00:18)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve found a kind of revival guide referred to WRT54G that someone says &quot;very similar&quot; to WAG54GP2 !?!?!?!...http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=47259...I don&#039;t known if could be useful..<br />Anyway, I&#039;m very interested! ..I&#039;ve this device and I would like to try Openwrt. Also I&#039;ve tried to upload, using the default linksys web interface, the same firmware used by you ..anyway the upload/update has failed for unknown reasons. Luckily, I haven&#039;t lost the web interface and&nbsp; I&#039;ve re-flashed with the linksys&nbsp; firmware before rebooting the router...Someone says to use, for the first update time, the squashfs version...Could someone kindly&nbsp; guide to a minimal procedure to install the openwrt firmware, that seems to fail using conventional steps?</p>									</div>
