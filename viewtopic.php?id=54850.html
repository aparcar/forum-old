					<p>Guys I don&#039;t know where to start so any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />I have OpenWRT running on a x86 hardware, I&#039;m using the image from this topic <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35887.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=35887.</a> The perfomance it&#039;s great and everything is working like a charm, ddns, multiwan, wifi 5ghz, but it would be great if I could to run a full java jre on it. I have tried jamvm, it&#039;s almost ok, but very limited.<br />The question is:<br />To install a full linux jre I need to compile the source with glibc instead of uclibc?<br />Is it possible? It was already been done?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any directions you may have to give.</p>									</div>
