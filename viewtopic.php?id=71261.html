					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;m currently using this configuration</p><p><strong>========<br />Model&nbsp; &nbsp; Hewlett-Packard HP ENVY 6 Notebook PC&nbsp; + TPLINK TL-WN722N<br />Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Designated Driver 50104 / LuCI Master (git-17.085.52855-65a089d)<br />Kernel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.4.14<br />========</strong></p><p>So the main purpose for using this kind of setup is&nbsp; &nbsp; ---&gt;&nbsp; VPN. <br />It&#039;s using ethernet port to connect with ISP, and sharing encrypted traffic over the WiFi with USB TPLINK.</p><p>it seems that I&#039;m so much limited by 2.4 Hz bandwidth, as a result I was trying to look for 5Hz WiFi-USB which is supported by OpenWrt.....Unfortunately I cant find it. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I need ur advice here, guys! </p><p><strong>#1. Does anyone successfully use 5Hz WiFi with Openwrt? Is it possible? If so, with which model?</strong></p><p><strong>#2. I could also connect&nbsp; end-client with ethernet , but the problem is that the only ETH port on Openwrt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is busy with ISP cable....and I have no idea how to configure this setup. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is it possible?</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vital21</strong> on 17 Jun 2017, 13:59)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I can give you some details about number two.</p><p>Currently your HP device has eth0 connected to your ISP for both, hardware and software.</p><p>For the software part, you can use eth0.2 instead of eth0, which means you&#039;re using vlan 2 wan. Use caution, adjusting this setting will make your HP device stop using the ISP uplink. That&#039;s intended and will be solved by adjusting the hardware. But make sure you can physically access your HP device and use a local keyboard for configuration and potentially reveting this.</p><p>For the hardware part, you need vlan aware switch, like e.g. the D-Link DGS-1100-08. Make one port &quot;tagged vlans 1 and 2&quot;, one port &quot;untagged vlan 2&quot; and all the other ports &quot;untagged vlan 1&quot;. Now connect the ethernet port of your HP device to that &quot;tagged&quot; vlan ports and your ISP router to the &quot;untagged vlan 2&quot; port of the switch.</p><p>That&#039;s basically the same configuration a SoHo router with integrated switch has. I do run this setting myself, except that I don&#039;t use an old laptop but a BananaPi M1. But there&#039;s no difference to wiring, I too have a router with only one ethernet port being connected to an external vlan switch.</p><p>So yes, it is possible.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I know, there aren&#039;t any USB 802.11ac adapters with open drivers for OpenWrt or Linux in general.&nbsp; A dual band a/b/g/n adapter with Ralink chip will work.&nbsp; The bandwidth of 802.11ac exceeds USB2 anyway though.&nbsp; Does this PC have a PCIe slot for a wifi adapter, and will the BIOS let you use any adapter?</p><p>USB to Ethernet adapters exist.&nbsp; You can also press almost any old router that runs OpenWrt into service as a managed switch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 17 Jun 2017, 16:36)</p>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>You need a switch that can handle vlans and is managable. The TP-Link SF1005D is not one of them.<br />I know there&#039;s the TL-SG105E, but since they cannot reassign vlan ID 1 but always map vlan ID 1 tagged on all ports, I&#039;d recommend to not use TP-Links.</p><p>The cheapest ones I know are the D-Link DGS-1100-xx.</p><p>Having a switch that has no configuration page, or has at least no configuration page mentioned in its documentation, most likely cannot handle vlans and cannot be managed.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t tell you anything about the SG2008. I only tried a SG108E a couple of years ago.</p><p>Both, the TP-Link SG108E as well as the D-Link 1100/08 are both around 35€, the TP-Link SG2008 is nearly twice the price. So I&#039;d expect it to be somehow better in a certain way.<br />But to be honest, I didn&#039;t look in that particular price range. I even didn&#039;t look into any price range at all, I just got my TP-Link SG108 when it was on sale for less then 30€. So I decided to take it. What could possible go wrong. <br />Despite the 108E not being that configurable I kept it nevertheless, because I figured it wasn&#039;t the sellers foult of not having me informed about the capabilities of that device but mine of not having done enough research and reading.</p><p>Being able to SSH into the router, which is possible for the 2008 according to its documentation, seems like a nice feature. So maybe go for it and try.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
