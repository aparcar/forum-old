					<p>Hello,</p><p>New user to OpenWRT (Attitude Adjustment) on two WZR-HP-AG300H devices.&nbsp; I did some searching and was unable to locate answers to three of the questions I&#039;m currently facing:</p><p>1)&nbsp; How do I install a DHCP-Repeater/Proxy?&nbsp; I have an upstream device handing out IPs and I want connected clients to pull IPs from that server.&nbsp; I did find some information for the White Russian release but it didn&#039;t work on this version.</p><p>2)&nbsp; For the second device running OpenWRT I simply want to turn it into a dumb access point - it will be connected via ethernet to a router located on a second floor.</p><p>3) I would like to bridge the WAN port to the LAN (total of 5 LAN ports) so I can connect devices to this router that need to be hardwired.</p><br /><p>And while I&#039;m at it - I assume OpenWRT uses the ATH9K driver?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to learn more about OpenWRT due to all the problems I&#039;ve encountered with my routers&#039; wireless performance on the MadWifi driver bundled with DD-WRT.</p><br /><p>Thanks for any and all help!</p>									</div>
