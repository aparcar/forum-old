					<p>Hey; i&#039;ve successfully installed openwrt kamikaze&nbsp; on a buffalo WHR-HP-G54</p><p>then i made some changes to /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless</p><p>everything works well.</p><p>next i followed a couple different guides and getting the source from SVN, and compiled my own image with any issues</p><br /><p>My goal is to create a customized image to flash onto a bunch more of these routers. the configuration and changes are identical i just need a customized firmware that makes these changes:</p><p>1. different /etc/config/network and /etc/config/wireless<br />2. add/change root password</p><br /><p>I&#039;m at a loss as to where i should change or create the two modified config files<br />this article seems to mention it:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/docs/buildroot-documentation.html#custom_targetfs">http://downloads.openwrt.org/docs/build â€¦ m_targetfs</a><br />but the make target_install doesn&#039;t work...</p><p>and i&#039;ve not seen any mention of how i would go about giving root a password before creating the image..</p><p>can someone point me in the right direction?</p><br /><p>thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ey,</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to configure the etc/config/network file before doing the &quot;make&quot; command.</p><p>The file I&#039;ve modified is /openwrt/package/base-files/files/etc/config/network, as it is said in your link this has to be the mother file.</p><p>After compilation, if I go to build_dir/linux-atheros/base-files/ipkg/base-files-atheros/etc/config/network, this file is identical so I guess that the final network file is modified in the compiled firmware.</p><p>I have also changed the root password, in the same directories, editing the /etc/passwd (changing the &quot;!&quot; for the line that I get from another /etc/passwd of another openwrt, I&#039;ve seen that the same password taken from a ubuntu passwd file is different than the one taken from an openwrt passwd file). If then I go to the build_dir equivalent file, I see it already changed (after compilation), so I guess that again the changes have been sucessful.</p><p>However, I was doing this for a specific reason and I have failed, so perhaps (or probably) I am wrong in what I&#039;ve said.</p>									</div>

					<p>mmeija:</p><p>Various packages have both pre and postinstall scripts. If your settings are being overwritten, then a package postinstall script is the culprit.</p><p>In general, the way around this problem is not to modify the installed source files as you have been doing, but to put the config files that work on your router in a new directory called /files in the top level of your /openwrt build directory. Modifying the files that way will be difficult to maintain as you update from SVN. For example, in mine, I have:</p><p>/Users/marca56/openwrt/files/etc/config/</p><p>and for a custom banner, it put it in /etc and for the custom network, ddns, wireless, and other configs, they go in /config.</p><p>This way, when I build, all these get included by default.</p><p>The other thing to look at is in the main make menuconfig menu, there is an option for Image configuration. I set a custom DNS server and a custom LAN domain there.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>marc.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks everyone for your help</p><p>ggerard: i believe if you use the /files folder, it&#039;ll overwrite whatever you configure in menuconfig for network settings...&nbsp; as this seems to trump all of the packaging scripts and makefiles and the like</p><p>Matt</p>									</div>

					<p>ggerard:</p><p>That&#039;s the point of the /files configs... the opkg spec is sort of loose in that it doesn&#039;t require or forbid the use of a post install script. /files helps smooth things out if necessary.</p><p>marc.</p>									</div>
