					<p>I am on my fifth WGT634U, and so far 3 of them have suffered all kinds of random crashes and segfaults.&nbsp; My first case seemed like it was the MADWIFI drivers, as once the card initialiazed, you would experience random &quot;virtual smoke&quot;.&nbsp; (kernel panics usually)</p><p>This is caused by a BAD DESIGN on the power regulation circuits in the WGT!</p><p>The &quot;stock&quot; power transformer that came with my units is a Linear &quot;wall wart&quot; type with an iron core transformer rated at 12vdc &amp; 1200ma.&nbsp; On 3 of these, the open circuit voltage was in excess of 18vdc and the voltage with the WGT connected was over 15v.&nbsp; This is a little &quot;hot&quot; for the small buck regulators on the WGT mainboard.&nbsp; In addition, I was pushing close to half a volt of AC ripple under load!</p><p>This seems to get them too hot and after a bit the router becomes unstable.&nbsp; My first-glance analysis is that there is a lack of filter capacitance for both the input and outputs.&nbsp; I will do a more through analysis and post my findings here soon.</p><p>Until then the best solution is to run a power adaptor that is actually at 12vdc or lower under load.&nbsp; I have found that a 5vdc adaptor works fine as long as you aren&#039;t using USB, and a 7.5vdc is perfect for everything.</p><p>So if you are experiencing strange crashes, BEFORE reporting a bug or opening that ticket, PLEASE try a lower-voltage power supply!</p><p>If you aren&#039;t using USB, the ones for the other Netgear products (5VDC) work great!</p><p>Hope this helps!!!</p>									</div>
