					<p>Hello, i need ur help.</p><p>First of all, i`m using OpenWRT on 1043ND and WDR3600. I`m using also an SME server as OpenVPN server, and i connect to it with the OpenWRT devices, creating a tunnel.<br />All devices have their own externap IP, and the internat addresses are the same: SME - 192.168.0.x , OpenWRT 192.168.2.x, OpenWRT 192.168.3.x and so on. So when i connect with OpenWRTs to the SME, i have traffic between 192.168.0.x and 192.168.2.x and so on...</p><p>Now i must to create a VPN connection between two OpenWRT device.. and my question is how i can do that too? Dont matter what which one will be the server.. Thanks..</p><p>PS: I`m using the current configuration with openvpn-openssl package, with a 2048bit key.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>That&#039;s not really what you asked, but instead of OpenVPN you might give tinc a try.<br />I dropped OpenVPN a couple of months ago in favor of tinc, and I don&#039;t regret it.</p><p>In tinc you have direct node communication as part of its internal mesh concept. You still need at least one commonly known host name or IP address. Having more of them doesn&#039;t hurt. But in general, as soon as there is a link between two nodes either directly or via a certain number of hops, those nodes try to connect to each other directly. Of course you can disable that, but default is &quot;try direct connection if possible&quot;.</p><p>That&#039;s really awesom. My IPv6 example was two local computers in seperated vlans of my home network connecting to a 200ms away VPS in a data center on the opposite side of the world. The two local computers in separate vlans didn&#039;t know each other, both only knew the VPS in the data center. The first three pings from one of my local computers to the other were 450ms, but after less then 5 seconds the nodes realized that they could route in 1ms directly, started doing that and avoided the VPS unless the target IP was the VPSs one.</p><p>So, really really aweson.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
