					<p>Hi,</p><p>I would like to use openwrt as Xen DomU. I found <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/xen">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/xen</a> According to that, I have to install openwrt from source. I found <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a> , maybe it is appropriate for that, but I have some problems:<br />./scripts/feeds update -a<br />gives permission denied message. I skipped that, because it is optional.<br />make defconfig<br />It needed g++, but it is installed (weird), so I used FORCE=1.<br />make defconfig FORCE=1<br />make: execvp: /media/data/install/openwrt/trunk/scripts/getver.sh: Enged√©ly megtagadva (permission denied)<br />/bin/sh: ./scripts/metadata.pl: Permission denied<br />Failed to build tmp/.config-package.in<br />/bin/sh: ./scripts/metadata.pl: Permission denied<br />make: *** [prepare-tmpinfo] Error 1<br />I did it as root, so I don&#039;t understand the error message.</p>									</div>
