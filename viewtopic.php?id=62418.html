					<p>2-3 years ago I tried DLINK DIR-620 with openwrt.<br />After compilation and flashing wifi was not working. &#039;iw&#039; did not see any &#039;phy&#039;.<br />Read some forums and found kernel patch. Commented some lines in ralink wifi driver, recompiled, flashed again.<br />Wifi was operational that time.<br />But wifi was not stable. Speed is low, often hanging..<br />I had to sell this router and bought another one on atheros chipset. Atheros is the best, no problem with it.<br />Since then I avoid ralink routers at all cost.&nbsp; Ralink drivers in linux are bad.<br />USB ralink dongles also work very bad with linux, hang kernel sometimes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 28 Jan 2016, 13:50)</p>
