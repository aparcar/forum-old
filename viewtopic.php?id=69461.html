					<p>Hello world,</p><p>I&#039;m running into a problem connecting to an apple airport extreme that I don&#039;t experience with any other router - netgear, linksys, asus, etc. Per the logs below, supplicant successfully authenticates and associates with the extreme but fails with reason 2: PREV_AUTH_NOT_VALID in the dhcp state, each time, and only against the airport extreme. I&#039;m not sure if this is related to dhcpc or it just happens to be a timing issue with how/when syslogd handles the logs. This is becoming a nuisance. Assuming for a second that this is not an Apple router issue, how is wpa_supplicant supposed to respond/react upon receipt of reason2? I&#039;d appreciate any help and direction. Thank a lot!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Tue Jan 17 18:42:39 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wwan&#039; is enabled
