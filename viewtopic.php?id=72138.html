					<p>Setting up a bridged wireless client requires specific support from the wireless driver that is operating your wireless radio IC or SoC. Most drivers available for OpenWRT do not support this operation mode, the Broadcom proprietary driver being a notable exception. However, using this proprietary driver requires that you also have a Broadcom wireless chipset on your router.</p><p>Since your router model is using an Atheros chipset, I recommend you look at the following wiki page for steps on how to configure a pseudobridge with the help of relayd daemon: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>How can I add an image?</p></blockquote></div><p>Store the image to Imgur, or similar image upload service, and post the link here, either as a raw link or by using the &#039;img&#039; HTML element (you can find this from the toolbar). Note that you cannot post links yet; you will need to gain reputation first by posting ordinary messages.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 25 Sep 2017, 09:24)</p>
