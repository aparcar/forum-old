					<p>Greets,</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to find a cookbook for installing OpenWRT on an ALIX.2D2.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried following many references to &quot;go here -- it&#039;s all been explained there&quot; and many of those links are broken.&nbsp; Some more badly than others.</p><p>Does anyone have a =simple= how-to that doesn&#039;t require downloading an entire source tree and compiling?&nbsp; Or better yet, does anyone have a pointer to an ext2 imagine I could flash and use to boot my ALIX.2D2?&nbsp; I could also use an ALIX.3D2 or ALIX.3D3 image as I have plenty of both of those as well.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to put together a product that could become a solar powered WiFi bridge / router / mesh / hotspot / whatever and would prefer to spend more of my time working on the power and physical hardware aspects and less of my time chasing dead links or recompiling software.</p>									</div>

					<p>Tallgirl,</p><p>The wiki page for the Alix provides a lot of information and talks about how to flash the device. I know it&#039;s still up to date because myself and another user rewrote it only last month! See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/pcengines/alix#using.pre-built.images">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/pcengines/a … ilt.images</a></p><p>In short: You&#039;ll just want to download one of the images from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc5/x86_generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/1 … 6_generic/</a> (the ext2 one is fine), flash it to the CF card as per the instructions, and then install it in the device. Again, as the wiki page says, you will need to install some additional packages to use USB or WiFi. There are too many different models of Alix to provide a universal pre-built package that covers all of them.</p><p>If you find something on your travels that is missing from the wiki page then please do go ahead and add it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>Usually one just has to &quot;dd&quot; the combined image onto the CF card.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc5/x86_generic/openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext2.img.gz
gunzip openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext2.img.gz
dd if=openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext2.img of=/dev/cfcard</code></pre></div><p>Afterwards you can use the usual utilities like fdisk, tune2fs etc. to resize the system partition (its only around 40MB by default) and maybe upgrade the filesystem.<br />Sometimes you need to change the root= parameter in the grub settings if the booting kernel does not find the root device. You&#039;ll find the menu.list within the first partition.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;ve been having trouble getting the wireless interface up using the generic image. am using Compex WLM54GP23 on Alix3d2.</p><p>I noticed in the same link mentioned above:<br />The generic x86 ones will not include the appropriate drivers (e.g. wireless, LED support, USB). Building your own image and specifying the build profile below will ensure the appropriate drivers are all included in the image. </p><p>However when I was building the source as per <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a>, the only configuration option in make menuconfig is for alix2. Would that work ok? Am still compiling the source right now...</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;ll want to select the &quot;x86&quot; platform, and then the &quot;Alix&quot; profile (it may be named Alix2, that&#039;ll be fine, they&#039;re all basically the same hardware).</p><p>That Compex card you have is supported by the ath5k or madwifi drivers (see <a href="http://www.wikidevi.com/wiki/Compex_WLM54GP23)">http://www.wikidevi.com/wiki/Compex_WLM54GP23)</a>, so you&#039;ll need to find one of them in the make menuconfig menus and enable it (under Kernel Modules &gt; Wireless Drivers if I remember rightly).</p><p>If your Alix board also has USB (and I think yours does), then you&#039;ll want to enable the USB kernel modules (kmod-usb-*).</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>I am working on setting up OpenWRT on ALIX 3d2 boards. I followed the same process mentioned on this thread to flash the OS onto a CF card. But, I am facing an issue which causes the system to hang during the booting process. It seems to hang after the loading the ethernet driver and creating the eth0 interface. Has anybody faced this issue? Any help would be really useful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you connected via a serial console to watch the boot process?&nbsp; There is likely some good info there.&nbsp; Are you following the Alix.1d instructions from the wiki?&nbsp; It appears the 3d3 has an Award BIOS so it appears to have the most in common with that board.</p><p>I just did a 2d2 today and had no issues once I got the right kernel modules loaded.&nbsp; I did a build from source rather than using the x86-generic and then applying the kmod packages.</p><p>-Brian</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Brian</p><p>Earlier I was watching the boot process on the using a monitor via the VGA output. As you mentioned, I tried to use to serial port to watch the boot process. Using the serial connection I saw the &quot;Please press Enter to activate this console.&quot; prompt. This allowed me to reach the login screen and everything seemed to be fine. </p><p>Thanks<br />Ashish</p>									</div>
