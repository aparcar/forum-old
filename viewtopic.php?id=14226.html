					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have 2 ASUS WL500gP<br />I need to exchange the &#039;main&#039; router with &#039;spare&#039; router<br />I did a backup of the &#039;main&#039; router and I restore the backup on the &#039;backup&#039; router<br />Then I did a fresh openwrt installation on the &#039;main&#039; router</p><p>After almost 3 days of problems getting them see each other on the same network I realized that both router HAVE THE SAME MAC ADDRESS</p><p>Where is stored the MAC address of the router and how can I change it?</p><p>Thanks<br />Ciao<br />Marco</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>thats stranged....</p><p>Normally the linux OS boot you with the mac address how it has get it from the network device.<br />It is possible to override them with &quot;ifconfig &lt;device&gt; hwaddr ether &lt;newMac&gt;&quot;, but this isn&#039;t call by the normal network script.</p><p>So I think you have clone more as only the openwrt image ??? Maybe you have copy some other firmware stuff thats run under OpenWRT and setting the MAC Address for the device.</p><p>regards<br />j0inty</p>									</div>
