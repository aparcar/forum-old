					<p>Uptime of nearly 24 hours on r5201 without any issues... However, the problem we&#039;ve been experiencing on the 3200acm may take 2 days or longer to manifest itself. </p><p>If by tonight there are still no issues, I&#039;ll go ahead and upload all the packages to the server so everyone can start downloading. </p><p>One change I made on this end was with the mwlwifi marked version...
