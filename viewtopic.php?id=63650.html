					<p>You can be sure the fix will be backported to Samba 3.6. At least Debian still supports Samba 3.6 in their &quot;oldstable&quot; release 7 (Wheezy). So, they will issue some sort of fix or workaround for their samba 3.6 package. The same is true for 4.1 which may officially be &quot;unsupported&quot; by the Samba team, but is still supported by various distributions like Debian 8 (Jessie) or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty).</p>									</div>

					<p>They actually officially patched 3.6.25.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m reading the CVEs correctly but it really looks to me like it&#039;s a non-issue if you don&#039;t use active directory?</p><p><a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html">https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html</a></p>									</div>
