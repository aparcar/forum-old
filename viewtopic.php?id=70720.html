					<p>I have a custom image of the latest stable OpenWRT release installed on a Trendnet TEW-732BR.&nbsp; It is daisy-chained with a static IP to a ADSL modem/router combination at 192.168.1.2.&nbsp; The ADSL modem administration is via web interface at 192.168.1.1</p><p>The Trendnet TEW-732BR luci access was set to 192.168.2.1.<br />My workstation and network printer request STATIC addresses 192.168.2.2 and 192.168.2.3 respectively.&nbsp; DHCP is enabled and hands out addresses 192.168.2.5 -&gt; 192.168.2.12.</p><p>What I would like to do is to prevent DHCP clients from accessing the configuration interfaces on the ADSL modem and the Trendnet router.&nbsp; My LAN is ipv4 based (ipv6 has been disabled).</p><p>There may be 2 options:&nbsp; Allow Filter based on MAC vs Allow Filtering based on IP =192.168.2.2.</p><p>So the questions:</p><p>I suspect this is a common firewall implementation - is there a simple setup that I&#039;m missing?<br />If I write a rule I would like the rule(s) to be simple and robust&nbsp; Is there a difference between MAC filtering and IP filtering?<br />Do I need to&nbsp; specify port 192.168.1.1:80 and 192.168.2.1:80 in the rules?</p><p>Edited for clarity.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 30 Apr 2017, 16:10)</p>

					<p>Based on the OpenWRT firewall howto, you can only filter packets between networks and not within a network.&nbsp; Stock firmware on my old Linksys WRT54gV8 would turn off wireless access to the routers configuration port but apparently not by using packet filtering.&nbsp; If I find a solution, I&#039;ll post it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your setup is somehow strange (to me).<br />Anyway, if you plan to keep it as it is, a rule in /etc/firewall.user like that</p><p><strong>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.2.0/24 -d 192.168.2.1 --dport 80 -j REJECT</strong></p><p>will prevent all IP&#039;s in the 2.1 - 2.254 range from accessing LuCI.<br />Of course, you can add another rule that can grant access for a specific IP or an IP range.<br />Or you can choose to only block an IP range.</p><p>In few words, you can customize the rules in a way that suits your needs.<br />There are many examples of iptables usage on the net, google it.</p><p>Another option is to disable LuCI permanently<br /><strong># /etc/init.d/uhttpd disable</strong><br /><strong># /etc/init.d/uhttpd stop</strong><br />and run<br /><strong># /etc/init.d/uhttpd start</strong><br />whenever you need to access it, do whatever you want and then stop it again.</p><p>All these are for the OpenWrt router, I&#039;m not sure how to block access to the modem at 192.168.1.1</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 26 Apr 2017, 21:55)</p>

					<p>For blocking an IP range, you must first install the <strong>iptables-mod-iprange</strong> package<br />and then put a rule like the below in /etc/firewall.user:</p><p><strong>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m iprange --src-range 192.168.2.5-192.168.2.254 -d 192.168.2.1 --dport 80 -j REJECT</strong></p><p>If you want to block multiple ports, the syntax would be like this:</p><p><strong>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m multiport -m iprange --src-range 192.168.2.5-192.168.2.254 -d 192.168.2.1 --dports 22,80 -j REJECT</strong></p><p>PS: Google is your friend, use it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 27 Apr 2017, 23:31)</p>

					<p>There is no need for mod iprange.<br />Just put those two rules:</p><p><strong>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.2.0/24 -d 192.168.2.1 --dport 80 -j REJECT<br />iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.2.2 -d 192.168.2.1 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT</strong></p><p>and only the 2.2 IP will be able to access LuCI.</p><p>#</p><p>I took a look at the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/trendnet/tew-732br">TRENDnet TEW-732BR</a> specs.<br />It&#039;s a good device BUT the lack of USB port is a big disadvantage, perhaps you should consider buying a new device with at least one USB port so you can extroot it and have plenty of space to install packages.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>angelos</strong> on 28 Apr 2017, 13:26)</p>

					<p>My main work station uses OpenBSD; the 6.1 release&nbsp; just added wireless n support to atheros and intel devices.&nbsp; The <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/trendnet/tew-732br">TREMDnet TEW-732BR</a> offered the upgraded speed, good open source support, a small footprint and was available from the Manufacturers website for $10.50 refurbished.&nbsp; Oddly, the board has solder points for usb and the chip supports it.</p><p>I had not planned on alot of packages and the TEW-732BR does have more free space than most devices.&nbsp; The flash is 8MiB and the flashable upgrade image is &lt; 4MiB.&nbsp; I was looking for bandwidth accounting along with a simple email program to email the accounting results to 2.2.</p><p>I rebuilt the LEDE 17.0.1.1 Image last night with the mod-iprange package, vnstat and mailsend-nossl.</p><p>OpenBSD uses a different packet filtering set that has good online <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html">documentation</a>; succinct yet complete.&nbsp; @angelos, are you aware of any online guides for iptables?</p><p>Thanks again for walking me through this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 28 Apr 2017, 19:22)</p>
