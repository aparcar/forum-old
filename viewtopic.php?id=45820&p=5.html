					<p>Yesterday, I received the modified PQI Air Card that pixelk has so generously loaned me. I got more work done in 10 minutes over the serial port than I did in a number of hours without it. I have a working rootfs that boots with a wifi AP up and running, and telnetd, ftpd, httpd, and udhcpd working. I&#039;m going to clean up all the debugging from my boot scripts, get the wifi client behavior working, and release the first version of the buildroot setup on github (along with a pre-built firmware update). That&#039;ll probably all happen tomorrow afternoon or evening (CDT). A huge thanks to pixelk for the serial access that made this possible.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry everyone - I was busy with family stuff yesterday, so I haven&#039;t had time to put this up yet. Hopefully I have time tonight to finish it up. All that&#039;s left is a few details, but changes in my buildroot setup frequently require a complete rebuild, which takes over a half hour. These last few iterations are time consuming. I do have time to type up an overview of what I&#039;m doing though.</p><p>I&#039;ll be releasing a initramfs3.gz that should work for any kcard-based wifisd card, though only officially tested with a PQI AirCard. The entire thing has been built from scratch using buildroot, with a couple of exceptions. I have no way of building the closed-source kernel modules that ship with these cards, so those are taken straight from PQI&#039;s firmware update. I also have been unable to properly build a working hostapd with buildroot, but since PQI distributes a static binary, I can use theirs for now.</p><p>This initramfs3.gz contains busybox with tons of daemons, including telnetd, ftpd, dhcpd, and httpd. It also includes dropbear for ssh, lua for scripting, and rsync.</p><p>It uses the jffs2 partition to store a lot more user-configurable things than the stock images for these devices. In this release, /root is a symlink to /mnt/mtd/root, /var/www is a symlink to /mnt/mtd/www and during boot, /mnt/mtd/etc is bind-mounted on /etc. This means that all changes to /etc at run time persist. The only thing in /etc you can&#039;t configure at run-time is inittab. It runs before the bind mount, and ends up buried under it. There&#039;s still some details to work out there to make firmware updates work smoothly with all of this.</p><p>My entire buildroot configuration will be up on github when it&#039;s ready (very soon, I promise!). Right now, buildroot doesn&#039;t build the kernel, but I should be able to get Dmitry Grinberg&#039;s patch working automatically in buildroot, allowing anyone to build their own kernel. The kernel would have to be locked at a version that works with the proprietary modules. I&#039;ll be distributing Dmitry Grinberg&#039;s kernel build with my initial release.</p><p>When I get it up on github, the repository will contain two folders: board and config. Once you have buildroot set up on your local machine, you will be able to just copy these two folders into your buildroot folder (or symlink from buildroot out to the folders), run a couple commands, and your image will start to compile. You&#039;ll be able to modify the configs for buildroot and busybox, as well as the layout of the root filesystem, before building your image. That will make it pretty easy to build a custom image for yourself.</p><p>Unlike the stock images that come with these devices, my initial release won&#039;t have an HTTP UI to interact with for changing the config or viewing photos. It also won&#039;t identify itself to smartphone apps that work with these devices. I do intend to support this eventually by adding this functionality in lua. That will have to wait for a future release. For the first release, you will have to modify your conf files in /etc directly over ssh, telnet, or ftp (which will all be started on boot by default).</p><p>Also unlike the stock images, my initial release will lack the ability to connect to a wifi access point. It can only host an access point. My very first priority after the initial release is to add support for this.</p><p>With any luck, my next post will be a release.</p>									</div>

					<p><a href="https://github.com/dankrause/kcard-buildroot">Released!</a></p><p>I&#039;ve published version 0.1 of my kcard-buildroot environment. Along with it is a <a href="https://github.com/dankrause/kcard-buildroot/releases/tag/0.1">pre-built zip</a> containing everything you need to update your card. Many of the details on what I&#039;m releasing are in my previous comment here. There&#039;s no instructions on what to do yet to build your own - I&#039;ll update the readme and/or wiki as I have time.</p><p>You&#039;ll note that it doesn&#039;t come with a mtd_jffs2.bin. This is because it retains your existing jffs2 partition when updating. This behavior is overridden by placing an empty file named &quot;factory_reset&quot; in the root of your SD card. This file causes it to update your jffs2 partition with the defaults (stored in /usr/share/mtd). Your jffs2 partition is also updated automatically if etc is missing from it. Also note that when updating, it does not delete the program.bin file - it just renames it to program.bin.disabled.</p><p>By default, everything is passwordless. That means it&#039;ll start up with an open wifi AP, and once connected, you can telnet to 192.168.1.1 and get a root shell. You can also ssh root@192.168.1.1 without a password. Once logged in, you can set a root password with the passwd command. This password will persist across reboots. To put a password on your wifi AP, edit /etc/hostapd.conf and change &quot;wpa=0&quot; to &quot;wpa=2&quot;, and change the wpa_passphrase to your desired password. FTP and http are also up and running, though http doesn&#039;t generate indexes, so it only works if you type a full path to a file.</p><p>You can place a file named &quot;pre-init.sh&quot; and/or &quot;post-init.sh&quot; at the root of your SD partition. These are called before and after init scripts, respectively. For legacy purposes, I also allow &quot;autorun.sh&quot;, which is called just before &quot;post-init.sh&quot;. The &quot;pre-init.sh&quot; script is especially handy for changing daemon config on boot, before the daemons are run.</p><p>I expect issues to crop up. This is a first release, and it shouldn&#039;t be considered stable. You could run into any number of issues, up to and including losing all your data. (I have no reason to expect you&#039;ll lose anything on your SD partition, but don&#039;t blame me if you do). I also expect issues related to the buildroot environment to exist. Please open issues on the <a href="https://github.com/dankrause/kcard-buildroot/issues">github issues page</a> or submit patches or pull requests. I&#039;ll work them as I can. If you want to be added as a contributer, send me a decent pull request first.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong> - a few corrections and additions</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dankrause</strong> on 16 Oct 2013, 02:15)</p>

					<p>So client wifi was pretty easy to get up and running. I&#039;m using the static wpa_supplicant that ships with the PQI firmware at the moment, because I have the same problems building it as I do hostapd. I&#039;ll be making a 0.2 release sometime today or tomorrow. You&#039;ll still have to manually configure everything. It won&#039;t come with a web UI to configure anything, and it won&#039;t automatically try wifi APs before starting an AP or anything. That&#039;ll come later.</p><p>cnlohr: I suspect you might run into a hardware limitation there. Even if a host device doesn&#039;t provide enough power to boot the embedded linux on the card, the chip on the card still provides the host access to the SD memory. I&#039;m willing to bet that even if we had access to the source for the sdhc driver source, we&#039;d find that it it doesn&#039;t have any communication channel directly to the host - only to the SD memory. Keep poking at it though - I really hope you find a way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Has anyone looked at the Toshiba FlashAir? I just picked one up. I plan to open it up and see if it is KeyASIC like the other cards (I hope). I have been trying to get access to the file system, and have not had any luck yet, but I have been able to run some commands from the card by putting them in the config file for setting parameters (this card can do client wifi out of the box!) but the config file seems to pass the commands to the system, so if I put </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> COMMAND=fat mkdir SD_WLAN/foo </code></pre></div><p> at the end of the config file in SD_WLAN, when I pull the card and reboot a few times, a directory shows up.</p><p>I don&#039;t really know where to go from here, I tried a few other commands, like cat &gt; foo.txt, touch, but these don&#039;t work, just cp and mkdir. I had figured this out when I was updating the firmware, Toshiba has a little utility that flashes a file, only it seems that it just places a file on the SD card called fwupdate.fbn then adds a line like (I didn&#039;t write it down, and I don&#039;t have the utility installed on this pc, I can&#039;t remember what the other 2 arguments were) </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> COMMAND=sd update fwupdate.fbn -nomount </code></pre></div><p> so maybe those commands are passed differently?</p><p>If anyone could point me in the right direction that wold be great.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did see the developers site, pretty cool that they provide that, and some examples for interfacing with the card. I&#039;m having trouble with the pictures, apparently I&#039;m not authorized to visit that page. Thanks for taking the time, I plan on following this thread, even though I don&#039;t have one of these cards (when I can get one cheap, I will pick one up)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I would like to know your experience when comparing the PQI to the Transcend-Card.<br />While it is sexy to have the Memory-Card plugable on the PQI, I wonder how the memory-access-speed varies (direct NAND oppose to Micro-SD-Interface).</p><p>Any Experience / Benchmarks yet?</p>									</div>

					<p>From the host standpoint you get exactly what you paid for (Class 10 for the WifiSD, Class 6 for the FluCard, and whatever you use for the AirCard).

					<p>Yeap, I meant the internal (firmware) memory-access-speed...<br />Maybe a timing of a repeated read/write of a large file would be a beginning, reading/writing 100MB non-zero.<br />Of course the PQI AirCard needs to get equipped with a class 10, too <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>e.g. # hdparm -Tt /dev/<br /># dd if=tempfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024<br /><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_Benchmarking#Using_dd">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SS … g#Using_dd</a><br />more: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_Benchmarking">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_Benchmarking</a></p>									</div>

Is that a hope for IO-Input? Or just a dumb switch to power on/off the Keyasic/wifi-part of the card.
