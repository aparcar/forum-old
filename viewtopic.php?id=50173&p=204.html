Overview

By default, when an OpenVPN client is active, only network traffic to and from the OpenVPN server site will pass over the VPN. General web browsing, for example, will be accomplished with direct connections that bypass the VPN.

In certain cases this behavior might not be desirable -- you might want a VPN client to tunnel all network traffic through the VPN, including general internet web browsing. While this type of VPN configuration will exact a performance penalty on the client, it gives the VPN administrator more control over security policies when a client is simultaneously connected to both the public internet and the VPN at the same time.

Implementation

Add the following directive to the server configuration file:

push &quot;redirect-gateway def1&quot;
If your VPN setup is over a wireless network, where all clients and the server are on the same wireless subnet, add the local flag:

push &quot;redirect-gateway local def1&quot;
Pushing the redirect-gateway option to clients will cause all IP network traffic originating on client machines to pass through the OpenVPN server. The server will need to be configured to deal with this traffic somehow, such as by NATing it to the internet, or routing it through the server site&#039;s HTTP proxy.

On Linux, you could use a command such as this to NAT the VPN client traffic to the internet:

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
This command assumes that the VPN subnet is 10.8.0.0/24 (taken from the server directive in the OpenVPN server configuration) and that the local ethernet interface is eth0.

When redirect-gateway is used, OpenVPN clients will route DNS queries through the VPN, and the VPN server will need handle them. This can be accomplished by pushing a DNS server address to connecting clients which will replace their normal DNS server settings during the time that the VPN is active. For example:

push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 10.8.0.1&quot;
will configure Windows clients (or non-Windows clients with some extra server-side scripting) to use 10.8.0.1 as their DNS server. Any address which is reachable from clients may be used as the DNS server address.</code></pre></div><p><em>Depending on your reasons for going with a pay for VPN service, it might serve your needs better to setup your own VPN server on the WRT 1900ac, as you would not only have full control over everything, its far more secure.&nbsp; The security is more of an issue since you&#039;re needing to route all traffic through the VPN.&nbsp; If you&#039;d like to explore that, I&#039;ll give you my IM name so you don&#039;t have to wait longer to get everything setup.&nbsp; </em></p><p><em>Setting up a server and client with OpenVPN is extremely simple and takes a relatively short amount of time to do (~15 - 20 min for an extremely simple setup, 30 - 45 for a more complex one). The Server is created via the server configs (like the one I posted on page 202), the client config is created (however I believe if you&#039;re looking to route all traffic through the VPN, and the VPN Server is also your router, client configs wouldn&#039;t be necessary... I&#039;d have to research that to be certain, as I&#039;ve never chosen to do that due to the speed constraints of ~15 mbps on a 65 mbps connection), the vpn interface is created with 4 or 5 commands, a few firewall rules are created, and you&#039;re up and running.</em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 21 May 2015, 05:13)</p>
