					<p>Safe </p><p>&quot;Fortunately the amazing OpenWRT exists so we can make this nifty little machine work really hard for us doing a wide array of things. Here&#039;s how you get OpenWRT onto this router:</p><p>Pre-Installation</p><p>Check the model version underneath the router (You really want v1.6 - the others work but this is the best one)<br />Download the version of OpenWRT relevant to your model version from the TP-Link TL-WDR4300 page. At the time of writing this was <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4300-v1-squashfs-factory.bin.">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … ctory.bin.</a><br />Wait for the download to finish...<br />Now plug your ethernet cable into the WDR4300<br />Install the Firmware</p><p>Log into the WDR4300 at 192.168.0.1 using admin:admin<br />Select System Tools then Firmware Upgrade<br />Press Browse and select the firmware you just downloaded<br />Press Upgrade then OK.<br />You will then see the firmware upgrade in progress.<br />After a couple of minutes this should switch to Software Upgraded Successfully! and commence restarting.<br />Post Flashing</p><p>The network range will have changed to 192.168.1.0, so you will need to obtain a lease on this range by restarting your network services or disconnecting / reconnecting your network cable<br />The new OpenWRT firmware is on 192.168.1.1 so point your browser in that direction<br />Youll be greeted with a warning that there is no password set for this device, click the link to set one.<br />Enter in your new password and confirmation, then scroll down press Save &amp; Apply<br />That&#039;s it if for basic installation. You&#039;ve now got a powerful little router running OpenWRT and the possibilities abound.&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>I also have trouble with the 5ghz wifi on WDR4310. I&#039;m using 15.05.1 now. Before I used AA. In AA it was working fine.</p><p>In CC 15.05.1 I sometimes have it working after a reboot in legacy with channel on Auto but if I disable another network (my 2.4ghz guest network, with: &quot;uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[2].disabled=0; wifi&quot;) I loose the connection to the 5ghz network and I have to reboot the router to get it back.</p><p>I would like to support to solve the issue if somebody would tell me how.</p>									</div>
