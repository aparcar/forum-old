					<p>Hi,</p><p>I found some promising posts in the forum that there is support for the NetGear WNR2000 device in trunk. So I grabbed the sources and compiled OpenWRT and tried to flash the device, but unfortunately without success.</p><p>It doesn&#039;t react on tftp (tried with several usecases, from windows and macos, cmdline and gui tools). Using the proprietary NetGear web UI doesn&#039;t allow me to flash the bin files. After getting telnet enabled, I looked for some useful scripts in the cgi-bin directory and tried several combinations with the redboot cgi&#039;s.</p><p>All I want to have is a OpenWRT device (built from trunk) that allows me to use the NetGear WNR2000 as a simple wireless bridge with wireless mac address filter, as I do not need anything like firewall, SPI, DMZ, and even the 4 LAN ports are not necessary for my situation.</p><p>If anyone has some ideas on how to get my build running (and maybe some help on configuration issues for the bridging thing), this would be great.</p>									</div>

					<p>Howdy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone has flashed this device with OpenWRT.&nbsp; I flashed it a few times but had checksum issues.&nbsp; Right now if you want to use OpenWRT you need to solder in a rs232 serial port and tftpboot using u-boot.&nbsp; Works, I&#039;ve done it.</p><p>Here is the thread on this router:&nbsp; <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18279">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18279</a></p>									</div>
