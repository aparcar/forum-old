					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am creating a download router of my asus wl 500 gp.<br />Because the router is in my bedroom I hate a spinning disk because of the low but noticable noice.</p><p>I was wondering would a ethernet disk got the same performance of a usb2 disk for this purpose.<br />Or would sending packets over the ethernet create more cpu then when it is connected to usb?</p><p>Basicly the disk will receive data from ctorrent. Anc be used as swap.</p>									</div>

					<p>USB2 (480Mbps) looks faster than 100Mbit, of course, but it may be that the unit can only write 100-200 Mb/s through its tiny USB chip.&nbsp; Run a few write-tests with dd from /dev/random and see how long it takes to write a big chunk of data.&nbsp; Then borrow a buddy&#039;s Ethernet drive and test the same thing.&nbsp; I think that you&#039;ll only get a really good real-world answer from a good real-world test.&nbsp; Remember that the asus unit is 100mbit only, but maybe a wired gbit dongle will give you 480 mbit, or close, if such a thing exists.</p><p>Please, if you do any testing, share with us the results?</p>									</div>
