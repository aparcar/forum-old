					<p>I would say there is a nice selection of router/VDSL combos which are lantiq based that are fully supported in CC or at least DD trunk. I am typing this message on VDSL connection that uses BThomehub 5a (I got for Â£15 on ebay), but I have also used tp-link w8970/8980 (be careful there as the later models are nor lantiq based).</p>									</div>
