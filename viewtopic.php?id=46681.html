					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I have two routers (both Siemens Gigaset SX763). </p><p>My goal is to create two networks, one for local wired PC&#039;s which are connected to the Internet via first router (ISP&#039;s firmware), and the second network (2nd router with OpenWRT) which is dedicated for WiFi clients. <br />Also I would like to separate these two networks into two different subnets. So far the first network is running fine, but I can&#039;t manage the second network (separated) to run on a different subnet. I only managed to make the second network working by setting it on same subnet as first router&#039;s network.</p><p>What can I do to make the second network isolated and on a different subnet (which would be fully controllable by OpenWRT)?</p><p>P.S. - keep in mind that the first network is working on PPPoE, and that the first router doesn&#039;t have the capability to make PPPoE pass through in settings (ISP&#039;s fault, they have disabled that)!</p><p>Any help would be appreciated..</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, you can make the 2nd router as a client, say your first router is 192.168.1.1, set you second lan as 192.168.0.1, then scan your wireless, just click the tab&quot;join network&quot;, then the 2nd can manage all your wireless if name a essid,&quot;openwrt&quot; is by default not enabled.</p><p>Lots of info in Wiki.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>
