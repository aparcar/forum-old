					<p>Running DESIGNATED DRIVER (Bleeding Edge, r49377) on a Linksys EA3500.</p><p>I want to add a static entry into my router&#039;s ARP table so I setup my rc.local like so:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Put your custom commands here that should be executed once

/usr/bin/ip neigh add 192.168.77.7    lladdr 10:c3:--redacted--  nud permanent   dev br-lan

echo &quot;HELLO MIKE&quot;
cat /proc/net/arp

exit 0</code></pre></div><p>But I see these lines in the system logs:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sat May 21 03:50:23 2016 user.notice : Cannot find device &quot;br-lan&quot;

					<p>I have seen that page before but it did not make sense to me. According to that page rc.local should be executed after the interfaces are created (nearly last) but the logs show that it is one of the first things run and clearly before the interfaces even start to be initiated.</p>									</div>

					<p>And how you have them in /etc/rc.d ?</p><p>S95done which includes rc.local is almost last one to execute.

					<p>Thanks Max, that was the key. I created this script which creates the static ARP entry after the <em>br-lan</em> interface is up:</p><p><em>/etc/hotplug.d/iface/10-static-arp</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if=&quot;br-lan&quot;
ip=&quot;192.168.77.7&quot;
mac=&quot;10:c3:7b:6f:41:84&quot;

if [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = &quot;ifup&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$DEVICE&quot; = &quot;$if&quot; ] ; then
  # set static arp entry
  /usr/bin/ip neigh change &quot;$ip&quot; lladdr &quot;$mac&quot; nud permanent dev &quot;$if&quot;
  /usr/bin/ip neigh add    &quot;$ip&quot; lladdr &quot;$mac&quot; nud permanent dev &quot;$if&quot;
fi</code></pre></div>									</div>
