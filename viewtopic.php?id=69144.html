					<p>I purchased an apu2 board and have installed openwrt on it for prototyping an application. I&#039;m at the point of needing to add a mini pcie wifi card and antennas.</p><p>Suddenly I&#039;m finding myself lost in a sea of options.</p><p>Can anyone recommend a card? (or three, there are three available slots in this board)</p><p>I need it to act as the wifi ap for a router on a busy home network (75 Mb internet). There may be as many as 10 concurrent devices streaming/browsing at a time.</p>									</div>
