					<p>Hello, everybody:</p><p>I&#039;ve searched the <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org"><strong>forum</strong></a>, the&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org"><strong>wiki</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.google.com"><strong>Google</strong></a> and was unable to find what I need.</p><p>Over an year ago I <span class="bbu">bricked</span> my <strong><em>WAP54G</em> v2</strong> while trying to install <em>OpenWrt</em> on it (pre-whiterussian if I recall it right). Since I don&#039;t have soldering skills I gave up on it and went on buying a couple of <strong><em>WRT54G</em></strong> and using <em>OpenWrt</em> on them.</p><p>Recently, since I&#039;m in need of another <em>Access Point</em> to expand my wireless coverage, I grabbed my <strong><em>WAP54G</em></strong> out of the box again and decided to give it another try. I was able to solder the <strong>JTAG</strong> correctly and using both the software and the instructions from the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/utils/HairyDairyMaid_WRT54G_Debrick_Utility_v48.zip"><strong>HairyDairyMaid</strong> Debrick Utility</a> I was able to get the flash and <em>Broadcom</em> correctly identified (which increased my confidence in that I did get the <strong>JTAG</strong> soldered/built correctly). After that I erased the <strong>NVRAM</strong> and tried to get it booted to see if it worked, without sucess. I then tried to flash several <strong>CFE.BIN</strong> files on it always without being able to get it to accept the <em>TFTP</em> connections I threw at it.</p><p>Using <strong>strings</strong> on the several <strong>CFE.BIN</strong> I was able to find out that none was specific to my <strong><em>WAP54G</em> v2</strong>. Since I believe that this is the reason I&#039;m unable to get it flashed, I&#039;m asking out for help.</p><p>So if anyone that has a working <strong><em>WAP54G</em> v2</strong> (<em>please make sure it&#039;s version 2, since I tried at least a <strong>CFE.BIN</strong> from a version 3 without sucess</em>) can she/he be so kind to extract its <strong>CFE.BIN</strong> and post or PM it? (<em>My personal model is the 2Mb/8Mb flavour, so if anyone with a equal model replies it&#039;ll be the cherry on top of the cake</em>)</p><p>If one has such a model and version but doesn&#039;t know how to extract the <strong>CFE.BIN</strong> please browse to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Firmware/CFE"><strong>Customizing Firmware CFE</strong></a> page (only point 1.2.1 is needed) or feel free to post and I&#039;ll try my best to help out with this operation.</p><p>In advance, to all my sincere appreciation,</p><p>(<em>Oh, by the way if anyone has another sugestion or clue why I&#039;m unable to get the TFTP working on it please feel free to post</em>)</p>									</div>
