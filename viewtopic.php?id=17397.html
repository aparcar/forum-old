					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m working on a new board which I have running OpenWrt. However I&#039;m looking for a clean layout of how the flash partition is best set and which FS best to use.<br />Here is what I have at the moment:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 00004200 00000420 &quot;bootstrap&quot;
mtd1: 00004200 00000420 &quot;uboot_env&quot;
mtd2: 00039c00 00000420 &quot;loader&quot;
mtd3: 0018c000 00000420 &quot;linux&quot;
mtd4: 00318000 00000420 &quot;rootfs&quot;
mtd5: 0035a000 00000420 &quot;data&quot;</code></pre></div><p>I can still change my partitions and my flash mapping. The only part I would not like to move is my bootstrap (which loads my loader (u-boot)).</p><p>At the moment my system runs on JFFS2 FS. I have a separate kernel binary and a separate rootfs binary.</p><p>I&#039;m also looking for a nice an easy way to make a one file update file. Is there an existing mechanism in OpenWrt for this and how would I need to generate my image file for it?</p><p>It would be great if someone can let me know what the most straight forward partitioning, spi data flash filesystem and image genaration would be.<br />I think it can be good to have this as a reference for new boards.</p><p>Any ideas and hints are welcome.</p><p>Regards<br />Bart</p>									</div>

					<p>Is there no best practice to setup your flash partitions?<br />Is there no standard way to produce firmware files with a standard upgrade procedure?<br />Am I missing something?<br />Any hint would be welcome.</p>									</div>
