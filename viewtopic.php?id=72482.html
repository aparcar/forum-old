					<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Okay, mystery solved. Somehow the firmware on the router corrupted itself, not sure how or if this happened the exact moment he unplugged it the last time a few years ago...<br />I had to open it up, solder connectors to the board and get a serial connection up and running, then found out that the router ran into a Kernel Panic just after flashing the 1234 LAN and WAN LEDs. I flashed a trimmed down stock firmware onto the router via Serial and TFTP then and got it up and running again.</p><br /><p>Heya,</p><p>a friend of mine gave me his old WR1043ND v1.10 router to play around with. I&#039;m running 3 other OpenWRT Routers (v2 and v3) of the same family but I haven&#039;t seen something quite like this before...</p><p>Since I don&#039;t know how he configured it the last time (and neither does he anymore) I decided to fire up Failsafe mode, however the SYS LED on that thing doesn&#039;t flash like it should be. The only thing he knows for sure is that he indeed flashed OpenWRT onto this thing before he took it out of service.<br />When I connect power all LEDs light up for a split second, then turns on the LAN1/2/3/4 and WAN LEDs for a second, then it goes off for 2-3, then comes back on for 1 second and then off again. After that the LED which I have my computer connected to starts flashing like normal.</p><p>Question tho: How can I enter Failsafe mode? There is no SYS LED flashing (except for the split second which is no indication of anything) like I&#039;m used to on my other OpenWRT routers from the same family.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks for the help already!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EpicLPer</strong> on 3 Nov 2017, 19:19)</p>
