					<p>You could try to recreate equivalent firewall rules based on source and destination interface names instead of IP addresses. If you need to differentiate between public and ULA addresses, in some cases using 2000::/3 for matching any public address would be enoughly safe.</p><p>The last trick is really writing a custom script that auto reloads with the firewall like bolvan said.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Callumpy,</p><p>Since the ip6neigh documentation does not contain an example on creating dynamic firewall rules yet, I&#039;ll provide an example tutorial here for accepting HTTP (port 80) connections that are bound to a local server. This assumes that outbound IPv6 connectivity is already working.</p><p>1) Start by installing ip6neigh as explained in the project&#039;s page <a href="https://github.com/AndreBL/ip6neigh">https://github.com/AndreBL/ip6neigh</a> . Preferably, create a static DHCP config for your server in /etc/config/dhcp with the SLAAC option set as explained in <a href="https://github.com/AndreBL/ip6neigh/blob/master/etc/config/dhcp">https://github.com/AndreBL/ip6neigh/blo … onfig/dhcp</a> . This will make sure that your server&#039;s non-temporary IPv6 addresses will be always known to ip6neigh.</p><p>2) Edit /etc/firewall.user and add lines:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#ip6neigh<br />ip6tables -N wan6_forwarding<br />ip6tables -A forwarding_wan_rule -s 2000::/3 -d 2000::/3 -j wan6_forwarding</p></blockquote></div><p>3) Edit /etc/config/firewall and right after<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>config include<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;/etc/firewall.user&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>add these two lines:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>config include<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option path &#039;/tmp/etc/firewall.ip6neigh&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>4) Create your custom dynamic firewall script /root/ip6neigh_rules.sh using this template:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#!/bin/sh</p><p>#Initialize the dynamic firewall script<br />FW_SCRIPT=&#039;/tmp/etc/firewall.ip6neigh&#039;<br />echo &quot;ip6tables -F wan6_forwarding&quot; &gt; $FW_SCRIPT</p><p>#Create new rules for dynamic IPv6 addresses here. Example for accepting TCP connections on port 80 on a local server that identifies itself as &#039;Webserver&#039; through DHCP.<br />echo &quot;ip6tables -A wan6_forwarding -d $(ip6neigh address Webserver.PUB 1) -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT&quot; &gt;&gt; $FW_SCRIPT</p><p>#Run the generated temp firewall script<br />/bin/sh &quot;$FW_SCRIPT&quot;</p></blockquote></div><p>5) Add your /root/ip6neigh_rules.sh script to ip6neigh config file /etc/config/ip6neigh<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>list fw_script &#039;/root/ip6neigh_rules.sh&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>6) Restart the OpenWrt firewall and ip6neigh:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>/etc/init.d/firewall restart<br />ip6neigh restart</p></blockquote></div><p>7) Wait a minute and check if the rules were successfully created:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# ip6tables -L wan6_forwarding<br />Chain wan6_forwarding (1 references)<br />target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prot opt source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;destination<br />ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anywhere&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Webserver.PUB.lan&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tcp dpt:www</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndreL</strong> on 27 Feb 2017, 21:42)</p>

Those are the Privacy Extensions (generates temporary addresses) and Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers (IIDs), which is supposed to generate static addresses but unfortunately it has not been defined with dynamic prefixes in mind. So in practice it will produce a public address that will also change completely everytime your ISP changes the prefix.</p><p>I&#039;d say that this is the worst (most difficult) IPv6 setup for running a server, but it is not your fault. In fact it is the ISP that screws up almost everything by implementing a dynamic prefix. If it is possible, I&#039;d change the server config to not use Semantically Opaque IIDs, or disable Privacy Extensions (temp addr) or use managed (DHCPv6) addresses.</p><p>Currently, ip6neigh cannot differentiate between a temporary address and a semantically opaque one, so both are labeled as TMP addresses. If you want to go further trying to workaround this, your approach to use&nbsp; Device.TMP.PUB.lan for getting the address is correct. But periodically the host will generate new temporary addresses and the old ones will become unusable. That is why disabling privacy extensions could help, leaving only the opaque address on the link.</p><p>The reason for the Unknown-XXX name is probably because your server is not using DHCPv4 nor DHCPv6 for getting addresses, but may have manually configured addresses instead. It is easily solved by adding a static entry in /etc/config/dhcp. If it did not work, I could help you to figure out why. The worst thing to happen is your host also using a random MAC address, which is unlikely.</p><p>By the way, what platform/OS do you use for this server ?</p><p>André</p>									</div>

					<p>Callumpy,</p><p>DHCPv6 does not use MAC addresses, but rather DUID (DHCP Unique ID). But I don&#039;t believe that will fix your problem, as you don&#039;t want the same IPv6 address applied to your Ubuntu machine, since the ISP is changing the prefix regularly.</p><p>ip6neigh can assign a DNS name to your Ubuntu machine, which can be used regardless of what prefix the ISP gives you. This names will work locally, but as stated earlier, you will need a DDNS solution for an external internet-accessible name.</p>									</div>
