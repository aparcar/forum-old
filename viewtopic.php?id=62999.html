					<p>Hello everyone, I purchased a R7500v2 thinking that since they did away with the quantenna part that the entire board should be under oss.<br />I have built operwrt trunk from scratch and built everything.<br />My final product has a firmware that is not compatible with the R7500v2 but only the R7500v1.</p><p>These are the two headers</p><p> this is my header for the <br />r7500-squashfs-factory.img<br />device:R7500<br />version:VOpenWrt.r48806<br />region:<br />hd_id:29764841+0+128+256+3x3+4x4<br />but the actual header file for my netgear is this<br />device:R7500v2<br />version:V1.0.2.2<br />region:<br />hd_id:29764958+0+128+512+3x3+4x4</p><p>I have read that a few people have already tried the trunk on this router, but I am not sure how they got the img to flash onto it.</p><p>I tried hexediting the hw_id on the header to possibly fool the router but there is apparently checksums embedded in the firmware somehwere.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I found a (almost) good patch for r7500v2 here<br /><a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/601351/">https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/601351/</a></p><p>It works great, adding the r7500v2 to menuconfig etc, and the stock FW is ok with loading it.<br />Issue is that it does not support Wifi.<br />I don&#039;t know why this patch is not checked into the main trunk to get more experts help on the Wifi (at least the 2.4 should be same as R7500)</p>									</div>
