					<p>I have a Buffalo WZR-AGH300 with a USB2 disk connected. I also have a Mac Mini running OSX 10.6, connected via wired Ethernet to the Buffalo. I also-also have a Lenovo Thinkpad X201 running Fedora 16 connected via Wifi to to the Buffalo. Transfer speeds via SCP between the devices are thusly: </p><p>Copy files from USB2 on the Buffalo to the Mac: ~3.5MB/s<br />Copy files from the Mac to the Thinkpad: ~5.5MB/s<br />Copy files from USB2 on the Buffalo to the Thinkpad: ~500KB/s</p><p>I expect that the difference between the Buffalo to the Mac and the Mac to the Thinkpad is the difference of USB2 vs internal SATA, but I can&#039;t explain the transfers off the Buffalo to the Thinkpad. Anyone know where I could start figuring out why speeds from the Buffalo to the Thinkpad are so abysmal? </p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pratfall</strong> on 24 Mar 2012, 22:08)</p>

					<p>scp isn&#039;t the perfect tool the check wired or wirless performance. It isn&#039;t the right tool for file transfer either, if it should be fast, because scp encrypt the complete traffic and the cpu of the router is too slow for fast encyption.</p><p>so too your &quot;test&quot;:</p><p>3.5MB/s is the performance of your routers cpu encrypting with AES for sending it through scp<br />5.5MB/s seems to be your wireless performance<br />the 500kB/s is your wireless performance when your routers CPU is maxed out.</p><p>So use iperf for connection testing and samba, nfs, or even ftp for filetransfer.</p>									</div>
