					<p>I&#039;m having a bear of a time getting my GL-AR150 in a config where I can reshare hotel wifi in my room to multiple devices. I know the hardware supports it because the GL-AR150 comes with a chinese openwrt on it when purchased that does it. I just trust the chinese firmware to be in control of only me.</p><p>But I have OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05 installed and the latest luci and I can&#039;t figure out how to get it to reshare the wifi. Everything I have tried kills the AP once I fire up the client mode. Everything I have searched says it only works with broadcom, but obviously the default GL-AR150 has it working.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have had an AR150 for some time and would suggest that you take advantage of the latest GLI firmware as it has a &quot;STAtion&quot; manager tool which is really important when you use it in different locations.&nbsp; If you are not aware, there are issues with OpenWrt being able to access the WLAN when the configured WWAN is not available.&nbsp; Known issue.&nbsp; Search for travelmate.</p><p>That said, you are not clear on how you have configured the device.&nbsp; You should post links (for a new user change the first character of the URL) so we have a clue what your doing.&nbsp; I think you are referring to one of these links<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#bridgedclientmodeissues">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clie â€¦ modeissues</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a>&nbsp; </p><p>You should be able to use a newly flashed image with no modifications.&nbsp; Treat your hotel as an ISP.&nbsp; Technically you may double NAT, but it&#039; is what it is.&nbsp; If you put yourself on the same subnet as the hotel (relayd,etc) you have no security.&nbsp; You will need to create a new WWAN (STAtion) to connect to the hotel SSID (uncheck the box at the top of the page or it will delete your WLAN) or use the cable (it&#039;s faster and hotels are pretty poor speed wise&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hotelwifitest.com/)">https://www.hotelwifitest.com/)</a></p><p>Another issue you may encounter is the hotels splash page or login.&nbsp; Once you connect, do NOT expect that opening a browser on your device will spawn the login, and NO you are not just lucky and skipping it.&nbsp; Enter the appropriate URL and authenticate (I save the URL as a short cut).&nbsp; I have found that sometimes I get short leases.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a seamless process and varies from hotel to hotel.</p>									</div>
