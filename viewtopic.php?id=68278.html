					<p>Hi,</p><p>first of all, while filtering ICMPv6 is not recommended, it usually doesn&#039;t completely break things either (there are, of course, exceptions, and in general it makes fault detection harder). I have ICMPv6 messages filtered as well and have no issues connecting to IPv6 hosts.</p><p>To me, the question would be, to which hosts you cannot connect or get an unreliable connection. Then you can analyze that. Using your browser to see if it connects to the internet via IPv4 or 6 is not very reliable bacuse even in situations in which IPv6 works, it may fall back to IPv4 if it assumes your IPv4 connection is faster. You could use linux command line tools like wget and add the argument &#039;-6&#039; to see if your IPv6 connection works. Nevertheless, most &quot;view your IP address&quot; tools or sites, correctly showed the IPv6 address of my router when using NAT6.</p><p>One thing you might try is to disable the firewall option &quot;Drop invalid packages&quot;. In a recent commit to LEDE, I read that it might be better to disable it by default as it may filter ICMPv6 messages before your firewall rules to allow them are applied.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Timo</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Timo,</p><p>thank you for your reply. </p><p>I use this website <a href="http://ipv6-test.com/">http://ipv6-test.com/</a>&nbsp; which says everything ok except ICMP are filtered.</p><p>I haven&#039;t found any ipv6 sites that don&#039;t work. I tested ipv6.google.com and a few others and they all work.</p><p>But with exactly this setup, a 100% copy of settings on my E3000 openWRT I get all green at ipv6-test<br />and ICMP is not filtered.</p><p>But on the E3000 I use older sources. So my guesses are</p><p>either some of the more recent commits breaks something.</p><p>or the USB-ETH adapter is maybe not 100% supported? Could that be the case?</p><p>Or Rpi3 generally is bugged?</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m now recompiling and going to setup the v6brouter, maybe it&#039;s a better solution.</p><p>I did get it to work with the old compile I used for NAT6 but the connection was playing Ping-Pong</p><p>So I thought I try that from scratch.</p><p>a few packages don&#039;t compile though. I use IGNORE_ERRORS=1 to bypass them.</p><p>ebtables/kmod-ipt-nat6&nbsp; actually all I need is compiled without errors though. So it should be working right.<br />The &quot;Drop invalid packages&quot; and literally every other setting I already tried. I really tried everything.</p><p>I literally told the firewall even:&quot;forward everything&quot; &quot;input everything&quot; kinda like opening the gates of hell if a hacker knew <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> (Don&#039;t worry, the test case I&#039;m working on is not connected to the rest of the network)</p><p>Anyway, it all seems to be working.<br />I just don&#039;t like it if not everything is &quot;green&quot; on the ipv6-test.com while everything is green on the E3000 running openWRT.</p><p>And although it should work without ICMP, I read verification and control packages are done over the ICMP protocoll and can slow internet experience if it&#039;s not working.</p><p>so I rather have everything setup the way it&#039;s intended to work.</p><p>Anyway, thanks, your comments are always helpful!</p>									</div>
