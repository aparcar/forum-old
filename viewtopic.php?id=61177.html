					<p>Just Wondering IF it is Possible to have failover wifi wan ?</p><p>for example I have a WIFI connection as CLIENT MODE and works fine but sometimes It loses the connection for several minutes/hours,<br />is there a script, package, or tutorial that allow to have 2 or more AP previously configured with their own SSID and PASSWORD. and in case the main AP connection drop for like 30 minutes then other preconfigured SSID would get online ?&nbsp; and after some time if the main SSID then switch to the main SSID ?</p><p>some time ago I read that in DDWRT there was some kind of&nbsp; tuto would this... but was very complex</p><p>Note:&nbsp; I dont talking to have multi wans and when one went down the other wan can take the place..... for this mwan3 excels.</p><p>I mean with the same interface in this case wifi interface wlan0. would switch SSID unattended when online ping is ureachable...</p><p>thanks in advance<br />inquba</p>									</div>
