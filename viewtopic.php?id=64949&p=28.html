					<p>I have another question for David or anyone that has the correct advice. I have setup extroot on a 1TB WD Passport usb hard drive and have given myself an extra 40G for the system in the first partition second is a swap partition and the rest is split in 2 more partitions for shares. Are there any special precautions to take when upgrading/flashing with this setup? Any specific dirs or files that are necessary/recommended? I always make a backup of each file in the config dir once its to my liking so I&#039;m not worried about that, Is there anything else i should add to the sysupgrade.conf that will aid in retaining the configuration I have prior to flashing beside the obvious fstab samba mountd ... ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bfree77</strong> on 10 Dec 2016, 21:07)</p>

					<p>Can anyone clarify something for me? So let&#039;s say the 1st partition has the stock linksys firmware and the 2nd partition has a version of LEDE. The way im understanding is if you want to upgrade partition 2(LEDE), I have to switch to the first partition over ssh with the fw_setenv boot_part 1 command and then flash the sysupgrade.bin file with the -F option and it will upgrade partition 2(LEDE). And by doing this I can always keep the stock linksys firmware on partition 1. Is this correct? I appreciate the help in advance. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its amazing how many intelligent and helpful people there are in the open source community and the developers are just incredible. I know I speak for many in professing that we appreciate all the hard work and support that you guys(David and all developers) put in on top of your regular jobs, families, and busy lives. Its because of people like you that I&#039;m now buying a 200$ WRT3200ACM and within 10 minutes of opening the box, taking the risk of flashing new Open Source firmware. I never would have done that before and it took me like 2 months and about 20 failsafe recoveries to setup my first linksys wrt54gs with openwrt and a working VPN. I had this router configured with new firmware and a working VPN(both wifi and ethernet) in like an hour. I have always liked computers and technology but for many years wasn&#039;t in touch with my inner geek. In the last 2 years i converted all of my machines to linux as well has learned alot about it(without every really knowing anything about windows either aside from the basics), have built things with raspberry pi and arduinos, networking, could go on. I&#039;m not trying to toot my own horn either, This is all from self education and the incredible information and support I receive from developers and the community as a whole.<br />I&#039;m done my little rant I just know it can be incredibly frustrating and difficult work and just want you all to know your dedication is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think that david recommends using the backup tar when doing an update. That said, I installed his latest r2446 yesterday going from r2221 after creating a backup of r2221. Easy to get back if things do not work. After installing r2446 I applied the backup from r2221 and things were fine. I have found, in my case, that using the backup seems to work for me. </p><p>Have you rebooted the router after creating the shares? I know I have to reboot when I create a mount point so maybe shares are like that also?<br />--bill</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 11 Dec 2016, 18:24)</p>

					<p>@davidc502:&nbsp; David, I&#039;d like to get your recommendation on which of your recent builds to use for a business with 3 routers linked via OpenVPN.&nbsp; I helped a relative to deploy 3 routers using one of Eko&#039;s DD-WRT builds a few years back and now those routers are showing signs of senility (flash wear from using NVRAM command, possibly, which is among the reasons I&#039;m moving away from DD-WRT now).&nbsp; We&#039;ve also drastically increased WAN speeds (~200 Mbps now), so those old N-era routers are bottlenecks.&nbsp; Based solely on CPU performance (well, and price), we recently scored some of the $65 Amazon specials for WRT1200AC routers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now I know that some of the builds have wireless issues, but that actually isn&#039;t important because the business uses other routers as wireless APs.&nbsp; For these three WAN-facing gateway routers, the things that are important are WAN-to-LAN throughput, OpenVPN function and speed, DDNS function (need that so the OpenVPN clients can find the server), Samba server function (not for share access via USB on the router, but for WINS) and reliability and stability.&nbsp; It seems like my best choices are r2221 or r2446.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; Do you know of anyone else having the DDNS issue noted above by <em>dobetter</em> with r2446?&nbsp; </p><p>BTW, I take it that the &quot;target&quot; location for the r2221 images is the one linked on your TrunkSnapShot4.4.7.html page, while the packages (where I&#039;ll need to grab the Samba server from) are in the r2221 snapshot directory.&nbsp; It also appears that if I use r2246, then I&#039;m in for a lot more work to get LuCI up to the same level of function that r2221 has built-in, correct?</p>									</div>
