					<p>In <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59647">another thread</a> I have documented some issues with an USB device.<br />I have just found that Chaos Calmer (aka 15.05) has a udevd package available.<br />As the whole thing has been working fine with my PC&#039;s udevd but if failing to work with hotplug/procd, I am thinking about bringing the USB control to udevd while keeping everything else to&nbsp; hotplug/procd.<br />Is there anyone who already tried it? Any hint or suggestion?<br />TIA.</p>									</div>
