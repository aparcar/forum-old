					<p>Becoming a parent is a very important decision with lifelong results. Usually, this is a happy occurrence, but when women find themselves facing an unplanned<a href="http://www.womenscenter.com/womens_center_hyde_park.html">abortion clinic brandenton</a> pregnancy they must decide whether they are ready to have a child. If they find that they are not ready to have children, they may consider adoption or to end the pregnancy with abortion. Nearly half of all pregnancies among women in the United States are unintended, and four in ten of them result in termination by abortion.</p>									</div>
