					<p>Hi<br />My TL-WR2543ND has 3.13.17 (120509) firmware<br />When I try upgrade with openwrt it says: &quot;Error code: 18005 Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.&quot;<br />I already tried download latest trunk and rename it to &quot;wr2543nv1_en_3_13_17_up(120509).bin&quot;, but it didnt help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just called the TP-Link support line and filed the bug. The guy on the phone told me that he would contact the development team as soon as possible to get out a new firmware.

					<p>Maybe there are real reasons, that older firmwares are incompatible? Like different sizes of flash memory parts, changes in uboot or whatever.<br />Now would be interesting to know if current openwrt firmware image can be safely flashed over recent factory firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m guessing they added some type of validation of the firmware upgrade image so until we know what that does we won&#039;t be able to install OpenWRT using the web interface and it would also explain why previous versions of the firmware cannot be flashed either.</p>									</div>

					<p>What you need to do to get OpenWrt working on the TP-Link WR2543ND:</p><p>1) download the two .bin files from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd</a><br />2) firmware upgrade using the TP-Link interface to the factory.bin<br />3) telnet 192.168.1.1 to set a password (using the &#039;passwd&#039; command)<br />4) opkg update; opkg install luci; /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable; /etc/init.d/uhttpd start<br />5) browse to 192.168.1.1 and login with your freshly set password<br />6) goto firmware upgrade and select the sysupgrade.bin file<br />7) repeat steps 3 - 5, and now you&#039;re done!<br />8) i suggest installing the bootstrap theme for luci</p><p>I took me a few hours but this is how to get OpenWrt running nice and well. Without the sysupgrade.bin I was unable to install a lot of extra packages with opkg, but now most things work. I still can&#039;t access the nvram, but most things are working now. Hope this helps!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hylkepylke</strong> on 23 Aug 2012, 09:50)</p>
