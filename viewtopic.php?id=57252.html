					<p>Hi,</p><p>I installed the Backfire Firmware on my Speedport via Lan Cable.<br />So far everything went fine. I could connect per telnet and ssh as well as per webfrontend.<br />But after I tried to bring up the internet I think I messed up the network configuration file. Now the router isn&#039;t assigning any IP adresses and I can&#039;t ssh on the router any more.<br />So I tried to reflash the firmware via ftp, but I cannot connect to my router any more via the standard port 192.168.178.1.<br />Is there any other port configurated in the openwrt firmware?<br />Furthermore I tried the reset Button on the back to get in failsafe mode, but that&#039;s not working too.</p><p>Someone knows how I can unbrich the router?</p>									</div>
