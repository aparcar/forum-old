					<p>Hi all</p><p>I`m sorry if this was discussed in a different thread but I spend endless hours trying to find and resolve this issue. I&#039;m using Windows 7 and Intel WiFi Link 5100 AGN. With the original TP-LINK firmware I had 300 mbps with no problem. Now I`m using backfire 10.03.1 rc3 and my configuration is </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>Thanks for this post! It also helped me. <br />What does it actually do &quot; uci set wireless.radio0.noscan=1&quot; ?<br />I have a little problem with channel selection. If I choose auto than my Wifi doesn&#039;t work. Do you have a solution for this? Or could you please test it on your device?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, xcom169</p><p>the command &quot;uci wireless.radio0.noscan=1&quot; is actually disabling the scanning capabilities of the wireless driver. Wireless networks interfere to one another with their signal. By default the uci option is set to 0 and the wireless driver is actually scanning for networks around you and if the channels are too occupied it is automatically cutting one of the channels. You must know that in order to use 300 mbps you need 2 channels. Because a channel of 20 mhz can carry only up to 150 mbps so when you put them together you have 40 mhz channel width which can transfer your 300 mbps.</p><p>For your other question I can say that I also experience problems with the auto option so I just picked one of the less occupied channels in my neighborhood. I can recommend using channel 9 with the second channel below <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> and with the command I described above you should be up and running your box with it&#039;s full capabilities <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I hope, I helped ...<br />Cheers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>The same story. The initial connection shown as 300Mbits,&nbsp; but after few seconds it drops to 180Mbits. The actual transfer speed is very low and stays between 1Mb/s to 300Kb/s. If i switch to a single channel mode then i get 130Mbits connection speed and very stable transfer speed - 4Mb/s.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>woland_ca</strong> on 13 Jul 2012, 07:00)</p>
