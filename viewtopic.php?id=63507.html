					<p>Since you have a /48, have you considered splitting off one of the ports of your &quot;main&quot; router and allocating a second /64 to that port. Then connect the AP (via wired ethernet) to that second /64.</p><p>Once the physical network is in place, then you can create a third zone in your firewall setup (similar to DMZ) which would restrict access from the second /64 to the first /64.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had an old setup that I had just copied over from old routers that did not use VLANs for the guest network and just used NAT (inside by LAN network) to provide the guest network.<br />I have changed my setup to use VLANs as described at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan#multiple_network_devices">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gu â€¦ rk_devices</a> and defined IPv4 and IPv6 on all interfaces on all openwrt devices and now everything works - I have IPv4 and IPv6 on devices connecting to LAN and GUEST network</p>									</div>
