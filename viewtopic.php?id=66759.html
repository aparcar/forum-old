					<p>I&#039;m a novice home user.</p><p>Kaloz&#039;s image flashed OK on my 1900ACS v2. So far, basic function is working well: can access the net, wired or wireless, and my throughput speeds (testing with iperf) are consistent with what I was getting with the stock firmware. Just doing some cursory poking around, I have noticed that I can&#039;t get control of the WiFI LEDs. I also noticed that when I had flashed back to the stock firmware, my original settings were still there. </p><p>I&#039;m going to get it set back up and let it run for a few days. If someone would like me to test something specific, I&#039;d be glad to help in any way I can.</p>									</div>

					<p>Linksys stores the setting in a partition OpenWrt doesn&#039;t use by default. So if you go back to stock firmware you might indeed still have your settings intact.

The problem is I&#039;m currently using ExpressVPN router firmware, it&#039;s based on CC 15.05.1. If I flash another firmware, i&#039;ll lose all functions from ExpressVPN. If I can get an ipk, at least I can try it on 15.05.1 first. I found mwlwifi package in CC download source, so I think maybe it&#039;s possible to just update mwlwifi/</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wduwant</strong> on 16 Nov 2016, 04:44)</p>

					<p>Grettings and happy holidays, @sera et al. I came across your post while trying to troubleshoot some issues I&#039;m having. I have the WRT1200ACv2, and have tried both the Chaos Calmer and Designated Driver flavors of OpenWRT. Depending on which version, I have different issues.</p><p>For purposes of my set up, the WRT1200AC is strictly an access point, trunking in 5 tagged VLANs on eth1, and I have 5 each 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks, one per VLAN (maybe that&#039;s overkill for a home network, but I prefer separating traffic into home, work, printer, media devices, and also a guest network).</p><p>With Chaos Calmer, my issues have been more specifically with WiFi, which lead me to your post. More often with Windows (7 and 10, both 64 bit, on several laptops) it will stay connected but any and all data transmission stops, including ICMP echos. I&#039;ve tried adjusting various aspects of the wireless connection including channel and encryption (I prefer WPA2 PSK with CCMP (AES) for security reasons, but I&#039;ve also tried WPA/WPA2 Mixed Mode and/or auto cipher). When I update the mlwifi driver per the OpenWRT wiki, I get better connection on non-Windows clients, but Windows gets even worse - shows connected but NEVER transmits traffic. Checking the logs it appears to repeatedly attempt handshake, which I can provide if anyone has any input.</p><p>With Designated Driver, I can&#039;t seem to get VLAN tagging to work at all, which halts my progress there.</p><p>My question(s) for you - is there a way to incorporate a newer driver than whats listed on the OpenWRT wiki, and if so, how? Or is it better to use a different build. Once again, this is strictly for use as an AP but the multiple VLAN/SSID setup is essential to me.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any guidance you can provide.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dizturbedxmind</strong> on 2 Jan 2017, 05:18)</p>

					<p>dizturbedxmind,</p><p>if you have issues with vlans the first thing I&#039;d try is install ip-full package. Sorry can&#039;t say off the top of my head what might be going wrong but it must work respectively it&#039;s an issue that needs to be debugged and addressed. So I hope you don&#039;t give up on getting that to work all to soon.</p><p>As for building a more recent mwlwifi driver for the release, it&#039;s possible in theory, but apparently a lot more difficult than before. Can give it a try, no promises though. Building CC branch from source might be the easiest for you to get something that works well for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sera,</p><p>Thanks for the response. I tried flashing the image from Kaloz you linked in your first post (openwrt-mvebu-armada-385-linksys-caiman-squashfs-factory.img) and it seemed to soft-brick the router. Fortunately I was able to recover by toggling the power switch 4 time, waiting for the lights to come on each time. I ended up reflashing the CC image and updating the mwlwifi driver per the OpenWRT wiki, and (fingers crossed), everything seems to be ok for now. Should the issue recur, I will delve further into it. As the old addage goes &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it.&quot;</p><p>The link in your last post isn&#039;t working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

They have the latest wifi driver, are based on LEDE (which branched from Open-WRT about 6 months ago and has had alot more progress made -- it looks and works just like Open-WRT). There&#039;s a link in the wiki, but here it is for you <a href="http://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/index.shtml">http://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/index.shtml</a>&nbsp; It includes most if not all of the packages you&#039;ll need (fully featured) and regularly updated (once a week). </p><p>I&#039;d recommend flashing back to the stock Linksys firmware, then flashing @david&#039;s build. </p><p>Some info on LEDE can be found at <a href="https://lede-project.org/,">https://lede-project.org/,</a> but if you didn&#039;t know, you&#039;d think a LEDE build was Open-WRT.&nbsp; Most, if not all, the devs who make firmware for the WRT series now base it on LEDE.</p><p>Edit: And for the fastest speeds and best reliability, you should always and only use WPA2 PSK with CCMP (AES)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 2 Jan 2017, 21:58)</p>
