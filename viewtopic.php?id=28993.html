					<p>Hi there, </p><p>I&#039;m planning to buy the device mentioned above. My plan is to run transmission on the router and save my downloads to a <br />USB drive attached to it. With all the stuff I&#039;ve read I should be able to install and run OpenWRT/transmission. I still have four questions that I&#039;d like to ask before buying new hardware.</p><p>1. How well does transmission work when running on the router itself? How many torrents can be active at the same time and how is the download performance?</p><p>2. How fast can data be downloaded from the attached drive to a computer in the network? I&#039;m fully aware that this depends on the drive itself and my network connection. Let&#039;s say I have a very fast drive and a wired GBit connection.</p><p>3. Is it possible to route the bittorrent traffic through a VPN (like ipredator) while all other traffic goes &quot;untouched&quot;?</p><p>4. I there some kind of basic firewall config already in place when freshly installing OpenWRT and all necessary packages? I&#039;m quite the noob and I do not need anything exotic besides the things mentioned in question 3 and UPNP. I&#039;ve read the wiki but I cannot see if the the values marked as default there are safe for everyday operation.</p><br /><br /><p>Of course there is the option to buy another router in case somebody here thinks it would fit my needs better. <br />Thanks for reading (and answering)</p><p>orangensaft</p>									</div>

					<p>For me transmission works well with wndr3700v1, with external HDD attached to it. You can manage how many torrents can be active directly thru transmission web, or any remote GUI (ie. transmisson remote.net....) As to your 2nd question - data transfer rate is limited with USB2.0 specs. (but you wont get full speed because it will run thru samba, or sftp....) - best idea is to have hdd enclosure with usb and eSata interface as well :-)</p>									</div>

A possible alternative is the D-Link DIR-825 which is almost its twin brother.</p><p>If you want something more for torrenting, then you may take a look at Plug computers. They all have a 1.0+ GHz Marvell Feroceon/kirkwood ARM processor, no less than 128 MB RAM and run OpenWRT (other Linux distros as well). The most affordable option is the Seagate Dockstar; more expensive models offer more RAM, more flash, eSATA ports, integrated wireless and whatnot. </p><p>Depending on where you live, you might be able to get one of the better plugs for about the same money as a WNDR3700, an interesting option if you are satisfied by your current router and only looking for some low-power fun. If not, you might still get a Dockstar + a Tp-Link WR1043ND for less than one WNDR3700.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello to all, I have managed to get transmission to run as service on my WNDR3700v2 running backfire, but as soon as I add a torrent, it starts to download and soon enough it informs me that there is no space left on device.</p><p>The usb storage where its supposed to download has plenty of space and mounted properly. What I have noticed is that it the routers flash seems to being used for some reason.<br />Has anybody noticed similar behavior? Is there any way around this?</p><br /><p>Thank you for your time!</p>									</div>
