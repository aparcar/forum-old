					<p>Hi everyone, I have WR842ND Ver:2.3 that only gets to the very fist lines of U-boot.</p><br /><p>What I get every time is:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Jun 28 2013 - 10:06:24)

U-boot AP123


DRAM:  32 MB
id read 0x100000ff
Flash:  8 MB
Using default environment</code></pre></div><br /><p>I tried flashing three different firmwares (via USB programmer), but the router behaves absolutely the same (I can only see difference in build numbers and dates in u-boot with different firmwares).<br />I also tried using a new flash chip - same results.</p><br /><p>Please let me know if you had similar experience before.<br />I am starting to suspect that the SoC is at fault.</p><br /><p>Thanks and regards</p>									</div>

					<p>It is crashing is long before it tries to load any firmware.&nbsp; If you&#039;re sure the u-boot image is correct for the model, it is likely a RAM or SoC failure.&nbsp; Check power supply voltages.&nbsp; The main bus is 3.3 volts and the RAM chip should have 2.7 volts.</p>									</div>
