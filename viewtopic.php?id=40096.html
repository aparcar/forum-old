					<p>Hello</p><p>Im currently running DD-WRT but the forums are unhelpful with most members ignoring threads, not only from me, but in general (unless its development related)</p><p>My router is TL-WR1043ND. My thinking of switching as DD-WRT is based on OpenWRT so it shouldnt be that difficult or different. I just ask should I do it and are these forums more helpful than the DD-WRT ones?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>depends.. if it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it. After that decision you&#039;ll need to know what you want to do with your router.

					<p>Now what exactly do you want to hear? Better or not is a personal opinion. Some like OpenWRT more for it&#039;s versatility, some like DD-WRT more for its rich out-of-the-box configuration.

					<p>DD-WRT is not based on OpenWrt and the two projects are completely unrelated.</p><p>OpenWrt is more heavily developed and is rather bleeding-edge. DD-WRT is old and stale, but is pretty damn stable and everything seems to work out of the box. OpenWrt has more community contributions than DD-WRT.</p><p>OpenWrt supports more platforms and has a larger collection of extra software.<br />The devs read the forums and are helpful. The IRC channel is also very helpful.</p>									</div>

					<p>DD-WRT is based on WhiteRussian architecture build (Kernel 2.6) of OpenWRT which development from 2004-2006. The latest OpenWRT trunk codename Barrier Breaker (Kernel 3.6). DD-WRT also updated theirs to 3.6 but impossible to compile by the ordinary user and also there&#039;s a lot of bugs to be fix.</p><p>DD-WRT only have packages for Broadcom Chips, but if you have router with different processor like ramips your out of luck.<br />OpenWRT has 2000+ packages and counting which you can install from different or any router that is supported by OpenWRT. You can also create/build your own custom image with packages and configuration that you wanted in OpenWRT. While DD-WRT has packages installed only selected by their Pope. So OpenWRT is customizable in many more levels.</p><p>I would say DD-WRT web interface is easy to understand, easy to play with it but if you want more complex configuration you can&#039;t do it on just web interface so you have to use SSH the problem is their SSH is total crap and it&#039;s relies from the old architecture of the NVRAM and JFFS2. NVRAM is a storage of your configuration which is only limited to 64KB which is bad. Not only that it doesn&#039;t have a standard way of inputting configuration unlike OpenWRT it has UCI and you can install nano (it&#039;s an text editor for shell) then modify your configuration files all located in /etc/config which is easy to understand. OpenWRT is not relying on NVRAM anymore and they use more reliable SquashFS.</p><p>OpenWRT is the most optimized distro for router&#039;s and most develop than any other. So if your saying should I give it a try? I say FUCK YES! but beware you&#039;ll have to use wiki most of the time as people only have few spare time to replying on threads.&nbsp; Just use your brain much better ROFL.</p><p>They say you can buy $200 dollars router making to industrial router using DD-WRT, I say it can only do basic things that ordinary firmware has but in OpenWRT I can run server type application like lightppd, Apache, PHP Server etc.etc.</p><p>If your familiar with Linux distro like Ubuntu or Fedora. OpenWRT can do it also having a PC on your router. That how powerful OpenWRT is.</p><p>Progress of development.<br /><a href="http://svn.dd-wrt.com/browser">http://svn.dd-wrt.com/browser</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #src folder<br />dev.openwrt.org/browser&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #trunk folder</p><p>See how OpenWRT is heavily develop.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gendouhydeist</strong> on 25 Oct 2012, 18:35)</p>
