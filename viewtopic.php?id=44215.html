					<p>Hello everyone</p><p>I&#039;m new here and a beginner with openwrt, so I apologize for asking simple questions. But I&#039;m familiar with Linux at least</p><p>I&#039;d like to install openwrt from precompiled binairies on an external USB stick. My Dockstar is still unaltered (original firmware) and I don&#039;t plan to use a serial connection. I&#039;d like to keep it simple for now and to do some testing without breaking anything on the internal flash memory</p><p>I&#039;ve read the dedicated wiki page, but I&#039;m a bit lost :<br />- &quot;installing without serial&quot; begins with a &quot;then&quot;...<br />- I don&#039;t understand the differences between the 2 suggested flash layouts (the pros and cons)<br />- there seems to be a problem with the last openwrt version and the bootloader size, as seen <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12492">here</a></p><p>As far as I can understand, I have to :<br />- make a backup first <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />- untar rootfs.tar.gz on my usb stick (which should be correctly formatted and partitionned before)<br />- install u-boot on mtd0 (found in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/kirkwood/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … d/generic/</a>), but I don&#039;t know how and which file to use (.bin or .kwb)<br />- configure u-boot to start on usb first (if not the default config)</p><p>If I&#039;m correct, I shouldn&#039;t use uImage or modify mtd1/2/3 (but where is the kernel then ???)</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geogiraux</strong> on 22 May 2013, 12:49)</p>

					<p>hi,</p><p>i also have a dockstar running openwrt.<br />when i started working on it i had a lot of experience with openwrt but i ended up deleting the bootloader - luckily the store accepted by unit for warranty (although had a broken case) and i received a new unit.<br />second time i was more carefull and eneded up with a great firmware witch i use for torrent downloading, ftp, dlna and samba server running 24/7.</p><p>first you need to make sure you have newer bootloader (uboot) with netconsole from:<br /><a href="http://projects.doozan.com/uboot/">http://projects.doozan.com/uboot/</a></p><p>before trying openwrt i recommend makeing sure you have access to netconsole :<br /><a href="http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?3,14,14">http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?3,14,14</a></p><p>I recommend using the 2 stage bootloader (after you upgraded your bootloader as above, as it is safer for you and you&#039;ll be able to try out other OS like debian and arch linux (also great but prone to usb FS corruption at power failures).<br />instructions are (from netconsole - or serial) install kernel:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mw 0x6400000 0xffff 0x300000

					<p>Thanks a lot</p><p>To make things clearer to me :<br />- these commands will install openwrt directly on the embedded flash memory if I&#039;m right. Is it safe ? Is it easy then to change rootfs (add packages or change settings) ? I wanted to install kernel and/or rootfs on a external usb stick<br />- you recommand using netconsole, which is a serial connection over an IP connection<br />- the kirkwood-u-boot .bin file can be used either as a single bootloader or as a second stage bootloader. You recommand the second solution, all I have to do is to use the correct memory emplacement. But are the values on the wiki correct ? I thought there was a problem with the size of the bootloader with openwrt 12.09 uboot file, refering to the <a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2012-November/017628.html">mailing list</a><br />- I have to format the actual design of the flash memory : I have to split the actual mtd1 into 2 partitions : is there any special commands to apply before or are they &quot;included&quot; with writing the uboot file</p><p>I&#039;m asking myself if the boot sequence is not too tricky for me...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geogiraux</strong> on 15 May 2013, 19:32)</p>

If you haven&#039;t modified the Doozan&#039;s boot scritps as shown above, make sure you take into consideration to rename the <strong>openwrt-kirkwood-uImage</strong> file to <strong>uImage</strong>.

					<p>Thans a lot to both of you for your time and your detailled explanations</p><p>Since it seemed a bit clearer to me, I got myself in the whole stuff and... nothing : I actually set up my usb key as mazilo said, installed Doozan&#039;s bootloader (after backing up the orginal firmware) and changed arcNumber and the kernel name in the default boot sequence. But my dockstar keeps booting onto its original firmware ! Which is actually not that bad, since it still works !</p><p>In order to understand what was happening during the boot (can not find the kernel or the usb key for instance), I tried to set up the netconsole thing, but I couldn&#039;t manage to do so, although I carefully followed <a href="http://forum.doozan.com/read.php?3,14,14">this post</a>.</p><p>Would you have any idea by chance ?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have a USB/Serial Console cable, you will be able to see what is going on during boot. I use an old LaFonera <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/fon/fonera">FON2100</a> serial port + a CD audio cable as my serial console cable to interface with any Linux embedded device.</p><p>OTOH, if my memory serves me right, I believe u-boot looks for (either <strong>openwrt-kirkwood-uImage</strong> or <strong>uImage</strong>) Linux kernel file under /dev/sda1 partition. If so, make sure your USB storage is recognized as /dev/sda and OpenWRT is written on its 1st partition, i.e. /dev/sda1. You can find this information as follows:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Boot your DockStar into its original firmware.</p></li><li><p>Do a login into your Seagate Dockstar.</p></li><li><p>Once you are logged into your Seagate DockStar with a shell prompt, insert your USB storage into one of the USB ports on your Seagate DockStar.</p></li><li><p>Now, do a <em>dmesg</em> on the shell prompt and observe what device your USB storage has been assigned to, i.e. sda, sdb, sdc, etc. Also, you can do a <em>df</em> to see if your USB storage has been automatically mounted. If so, see what device is your USB storage.</p></li><li><p>If your USB storage is recognized other than /dev/sda and OpenWRT isn&#039;t under the 1st partition, i.e. /dev/sdb3, then you will need to change your u-boot settings and/or boot scripts (IIRC) accordingly so that u-boot will be able to locate the <strong>openwrt-kirkwood-uImage</strong> file.</p></li></ol>									</div>

After unpacking in a Linux VM and syncing OpenWRT .tar.gz from OpenWRT Kirkwood trunk repository to a USB Thumb, adding /boot/openwrt-kirkwood-uImage, and adjusting Uboot environment to boot that uImage from 2-nd partition (since I&#039;ve installed ArchLinux on 1st), OpenWRT is booting like a champ from the USB Thumb and works great.</p><p>However, when using the latest OpenWRT snapshot from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/kirkwood/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/kirkwood/</a> and going through exact same procedure, OpenWRT is stack on Starting Kernel, as I can see in Netconsole.
