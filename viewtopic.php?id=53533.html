					<p>Hi</p><p>I have successfully cloned the OpenWRT buildroot from the subversion repository and I&#039;ve been using it to build images that I run on Qemu. I can run the images in Qemu just fine.</p><p>Now I have tried to build an image for a router -- a Linksys WRT54GL -- but I couldn<a href="http://www.zleceniabudowlane24h.pl/">&#039;</a>t find in the documentation how I should choose the target.</p><p>I guess that these are the correct options:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - I have chosen Broadcom BCM947xx/953xx</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - In &quot;Target images&quot;, I have chosen jffs2 and squashfs</p><p>Then, after compiling, I went to the directory bin/brcm47xx, and found a large number of images:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>openwrt-brcm47xx-jffs2-128k.trx

					<p>You should use the image for your platform. If your device is not presented in bin/brcm47xx directory, then either it is not supported (look it up at Table of Hardware), or the image is not built (usually it happens when you exceed flash size selecting many packages; try to remove .config file, choose target platform in menuconfig, deselect LuCI and build it again).</p><p>As for jffs2 vs squashfs, you generally need squashfs one.
