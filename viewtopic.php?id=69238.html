					<p>Hello Everyone. I am looking to setup a usage monitor for keeping track of how much data i have used daily/monthly. I used to use ddwrt and there was a pretty slick graph. Has anyone setup something like this image? -- google &quot;dd_wrt_bandwidth_799.jpg&quot; and its the first image... i can&#039;t post links or images...</p><br /><p>I found a post from 12/26/2013 by another user, golialive, where they said the following. Does anyone know if this is still functional with Chaos Calmer? </p><br /><p>Goliavlie 2013-12-26 16:38:56</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hey there.<br />I just instaled vnstat, which is integrated through luci-app-vnstat.<br />It has traffic views &quot;Summary display&quot;, &quot;Top 10 display&quot;, &quot;Hourly Traffic&quot;, &quot;Daily Traffic&quot; and &quot;Monthly Trafic&quot;.<br />The &quot;Daily Traffic&quot; is verry close to what dd-wrt has.</p></blockquote></div><br /><br /><p>Router: Linksys WRT1900ACS<br />Firmware: OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 / LuCI 15.05-142-gb6330a1 Release (git-15.363.78009-956be55)<br />Kernel Version: 3.18.23</p><p>Thank you!</p><br /><p>Edit1: Router Info<br />Edit2: vnstat, luci-app-vnstat quote</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thehofl</strong> on 6 Jan 2017, 02:53)</p>

					<p>That is what I was planning. Thank you tmo26!</p><br /><p>OK, so i am newb to the world of linux and am looking for a bit of assistance. If you go to google and search for &quot;openwrt wiki vnstat&quot;, the first link should be the tutorial for installing/configuring vnstat. The step i am encountering issues with is the &quot;image generation&quot; area. How do i take that script and make it work? I have used vi and other editors in the past and am probably over thinking it, but i really want to make sure to set this up correctly.</p><p>Also, will the graphs be visibly from within the Luci webUI interface? </p><p>Thank you again for the assistance! </p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Edit: cry for help. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thehofl</strong> on 6 Jan 2017, 20:40)</p>
