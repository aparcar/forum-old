					<p>Hi,<br />I am totaly wrecked. Perhaps somebody can help me:</p><p>My aim: use openwrt for USB over WLan. USBIP or VirtualHere-Server should runon the Opewrt-Router<br />But this is a wide way.....</p><p>Taking my old WR703N (V1.6), I decided to give him the new firmware: Barrier Braker 14.07.</p><p>After this, I wanted to connect the device to my WLAN-Router. <br />But no way to get it working.<br />The LAN-interface is set to 192.168.1.250 (because my Main-router has the 192.168.1.1) -&gt; working<br />Opening LuCI, I setup the WiFi, as described in many tutorials. (DHCP)<br />After a reboot, I see, that the wwan interface gets an IP (192.168.1.25) and looking at the wireless overview all seemns to be logical (SSID, BSSID is matching to my main router)&nbsp; <br />But this interface has the same mac as the LAN-Interface???<br />I tried to override the mac in the config-file, but not even better.</p><p>Scanning with netscan, I see the 703n two times (with the above described IP-adresses). I can ping both IPs and get a reply, but when I unplug the LAN-cable, I loose all connections.</p><p>Over two days, I reflashed now several times and tried a lot of different settings, but without any success.</p><p>Does anybody have a hint for me?<br />I am thankful for any answer.<br />regards/brutzler</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brutzler</strong> on 20 Jan 2015, 22:44)</p>

					<p>Try setting a different MAC address for WLAN and Ethernet. You can set this e.g., in LUCI. Having both devices use the same MAC address (as it is the default in OpenWrt) never worked for me.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, will try with two different subnets in the evening.<br />Perhaps this could sove the &quot;problem&quot;.</p><p>But this would mean, i only can use it wireless or with cable in the same network.</p><p>I have openwrt on a rasPi with a Wlan-Stick.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I did not want to make a bridged mode or similiar. I want to use USBIP or VirtualHere to share a USB-device in the network.<br />Therefore I thought I can connect the router either with the LAN-interface, or with the WLAN-Interface to my home-network.</p><p>--&gt; Trying to override the MAC for the Wifi-adapter was without success.<br />--&gt; Using a different subnet for the LAN-interface, I have success to connect the 703n with Wifi.</p>									</div>

					<p>@brutzler</p><p>did you managed to get virtualhere usb server to work on your TL-WR703N ?</p><p>i&#039;m thinking of doing exactly that over wifi (adhoc), to turn an old usb device into a wireless one.<br />i have to check if the usb device is USB2 high speed compliant as it seems the TL-WR703N only supports that mode on its usb port.</p><p>thx for any feedback.</p>									</div>
