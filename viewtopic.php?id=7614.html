					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to find a way to stream audio from my windows laptop to openwrt running on asus 500gx. I have usb audio working and i can play mp3&#039;s locally on the router, but all my searches for streaming audio came empty. <br />Doesn&#039;t some of the linksys firmware do that? waveserver process or something like that? is that part of the GPL firmware? <br />Or are there any other options?</p><p>I did try with shoutcast and while it sort of worked, the quality was not very good. i&#039;d prefer to stream audio without compressing it too much... </p><p>regards,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;robert</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK the Asus WL-500g Deluxe has a Windows Media Player Plugin included in the stock firmware to stream from windows to the box. Perhaps you want to have a look at the internals of that firmware...<br />Also have a look at the packages of the upcoming Kamikaze developers branch that has perhaps the right package for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure if this is what you are looking for. But I simply entered the addresses I wanted to listen to into the phpMp2 interface without even thinking about it... (my setup pretty much follows the lines of <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/OpenWRT_FullInstall)">http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/OpenWRT_FullInstall)</a></p>									</div>

					<p>i have mpd running already and it works ok - but it&#039;s not what i&#039;m looking for. i&#039;m looking for a way to transfer the audio i have playing on my laptop to the router. not playing the music on the router. i&#039;ve tried that but none of the interfaces are very nice so far, too cumbersome. <br />Tom - thanks for the info, i&#039;ll look into this...</p>									</div>
