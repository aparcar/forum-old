					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Can you please recommend a good wireless router please ?<br />I have the following demands for it:<br />- gigabit ports<br />- wireless 802.11 N<br />- full OpenWRT or DD-WRT support<br />- stable !</p><p>I&#039;ve already had a bad experience with my brand new Netgear WINDR3800 (which seems to have a hardware problem with the WAN port) so I&#039;m not sure what to choose further, take my chances again with another WNDR3800 (which will replace the broken one), or should I go for a D-Link DIR-825 or choose something else ?</p><p>If you guys can recommend me something please do!</p><p>Many thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dinoc</strong> on 5 Dec 2011, 00:04)</p>

					<p>The wifi of the DIR-825 does not work with RC6 and will probably not work with the stable release of Backfire, since it requires a trunk patch which has not been backported yet. </p><p>I&#039;m running two of those with trunk as a 5GHz wifi bridge. Runs fine for over a month now. Had some stability issues when running 2,4GHz on one at the routers at the same time, guess that could be traced back to it being trunk.</p><br /><p>So you would probably be better off with a router that&#039;s supported by Backfire, or you use trunk for now and wait for the Backfire successor&#039;s RC.</p>									</div>
