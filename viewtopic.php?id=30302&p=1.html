					<p>I wanted to run an iTunes server on my wndr3700, controlling it via Apple Remote on my iPod Touch. The router has an USB storage device attached with overlay (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a>) and off course it also has my music library.</p><p>OpenWrt trunk offers the package mt-daapd, which is also an iTunes server, but which doesn’t support Remote and which is unmaintained. However, Julian Blache has made a much-improved version called forked-daapd (<a href="http://www.jblache.org/projects/daapd/">http://www.jblache.org/projects/daapd/</a>), which I’ve now packaged for OpenWrt.</p><p>If you’re interested in running forked-daapd or ffmpeg I’ve made a wiki-howto here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/forked-daapd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/forked-daapd</a> (it&#039;s still in the Wiki Inbox...

					<p>Hi.<br />Judging by your make-file, you use version 0.16 of forked-daapd? Well, perhaps it&#039;d be woth a try using the newest version, 0.19? Reading the release notes, a lot of bugs have been fixed as well as improvements made...<br />I&#039;d be interested in an update as I&#039;m toying with the idea of running forked on a router (which I don&#039;t have yet), since doing this on a full-blown Ubuntu server (something I have successfully managed) seems like an overkill to me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the tip. I hadn&#039; t noticed that Julian has been so busy this summer. It appears 0.17 and 0.19 include performance improvements, that&#039;s really interesting. I also read that 0.17 uses libdispatch instead of libevent, so that means the makefile needs some changes. I&#039;ll definitely look into it as soon as possible, but my openwrt build box is defunc right now, so it might be some weeks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ejurgensen</strong> on 13 Sep 2011, 10:42)</p>

					<p>Ok, here&#039;s a test release of forked-daapd 0.19 [s](with custom ffmpeg 0.8.2, which is unfortunately still necessary)[/s].</p><p>Binaries (requires trunk and ar71xx chipset): <a href="http://www.gyfgafguf.dk/openwrt/packages/ar71xx/">http://www.gyfgafguf.dk/openwrt/packages/ar71xx/</a><br />Sources: <a href="http://www.gyfgafguf.dk/openwrt/src/source.tar.gz">http://www.gyfgafguf.dk/openwrt/src/source.tar.gz</a></p><p>[s]Since I haven&#039;t tested much yet, I didn&#039;t update the Packages files.

Controlling the server via Remote on my iPod Touch is quite fast now (server is running on wndr3700). So that&#039;s a very nice improvement.

					<p>I don&#039;t know much about hardware, so I think other people here would be able to help you better. I have the wndr3700 and I am very satisfied. It has sufficient power for running forked-daapd and miniDLNA at the same time, but only just barely. I don&#039;t use minidlna much, so most of the time I don&#039;t have it running.</p><p>I&#039;ve submitted patches/ticket towards ffmpeg, sqlite3, libevent and zlib. ffmpeg has already been fixed, and if the rest are accepted forked-daapd won&#039;t need special versions of these packages any more.

					<p>A few words about running forked-daapd on arokh&#039;s OpenWrt build: I tried upgrading my router to arokh&#039;s build of OpenWrt, but I found out that forked-daapd won&#039;t run on it. The reason appears to be dbus and avahi. Arokh&#039;s packages do not include a dbus-enabled version avahi, so I tried installing the version from the official repository. However, this would not run, and I was unable to find a fix or a work-around. So without a proper avahi, forked-daapd wouldn&#039;t run.</p><p>Going back to OpenWrt trunk fixed the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>You won&#039;t be able to run it with Backfire, you need to upgrade to Trunk. The packages in Backfire are too old and don&#039;t include stuff which forked-daapd depends on. ffmpeg is 0.5.4 in Backfire, but is 0.8.7 in Trunk. It is probable that sqlite3 and libevent in Backfire are also inadequate.</p>									</div>
