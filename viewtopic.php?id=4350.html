					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to split HTTP traffic coming into my Linksys OpenWrt box (on WAN), based on HTTP &quot;host&quot; header, to two different LAN systems running web servers.&nbsp; How can it be done ?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>1. Is it possible to do via iptables ?&nbsp; I googled but can&#039;t find anything that works.&nbsp; The only reference I found was somewhere in HyperWRT forums.&nbsp; It talks about a &quot;webstr&quot; match.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find any iptables match extension that&#039;d let me do that.</p><p>2. I tried lighttpd, using it as a reverse proxy.&nbsp; It seems to work, but it crashes if I transfer a big file.&nbsp; The problem is, lighttpd tries to cache the file or something to that effect.&nbsp; It&#039;s (lighttpd&#039;s) memory consumption grows, until it becomes too much that the kernel steps in and kills the process.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find how to disable caching or set a low cache limit in lighttpd.</p><p>Note on option 1 above :&nbsp; I guess this is in tune with being able to block access to certain websites - like access restrictions or parental control.&nbsp; This feature is there in some routers and I think it must be using a similar logic to deny access.</p><p>Are there any other reverse proxies ?&nbsp; &nbsp;I came to know about &quot;pound&quot; (<a href="http://www.apsis.ch/pound/">http://www.apsis.ch/pound/</a>) - a reverse proxy for Linux, which can possible do what I want.&nbsp; But its not available for OpenWrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>So, what are my options ?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Other than the iptables solution already mentioned, here&#039;s another hack that&#039;s not as clean:</p><p>1. Setup a basic httpd with cgi on the router WAN port 80.<br />2. Setup a port forward on 2 other ports to your network&#039;s two web servers (eg. 8080, 8081)<br />3. Create a cgi script to parse the Host Header and do a Location: (302?) response to the proper port number.</p><p>From that point on, the router&#039;s httpd server isn&#039;t involved: all communications go directly to the respective internal machine.</p><p>You could get a little crazier and customize the 404 page to do the same, but intelligently redirect them to the proper full URL at the destination.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think you can do this with iptables. A TCP connection already has to be established _before_ the client starts sending the HOST header, by that time it&#039;s too late to DNAT traffic. Some very simple proxy server, without any caching at all, sounds like what you need. Or the 302 redirect that jeff proposed.</p>									</div>

					<p>The &quot;Netfilter Extensions HOWTO&quot;, available from the Documentation section of <a href="http://www.netfilter.org">www.netfilter.org</a>, has some nice explanation for ipt_string.<br />The ipt_webstr match module has been derived by CyberTAN (for Linksys), and not been updated for quite a while, and I&#039;m still trying<br />to find out about its current status.

					<p>Hi Venk25 et.al.,</p><p>I have just ported pound 2.1.3 to OpenWrt (mipsel) and will put all the stuff to <a href="https://schafserv.homelinux.net/WRT/">https://schafserv.homelinux.net/WRT/</a> ( not browsable)<br />Pound only works with thread enabled openssl which is not the case for OpenWRT&#039;s openssl.

					<p>Sorry didn&#039;t visit this site for a while ... </p><p>After my initial posts, I did manage to port pound to OpenWRT - but built with RC4 SDK.&nbsp; I had to comment out some stuff from pound source (If my memory serves me right, some #if checks on one or two header files).&nbsp; There were a few warnings but it does run.&nbsp; I still have one of my routers running RC4 with the pound package I built.&nbsp; Shortly after that, I ran out of cycles to make it a clean &quot;ipkg&quot; package - meaning it doesn&#039;t automatically handle dependencies (though there were just one or two dependencies - sorry don&#039;t remember now) - so didn&#039;t post it back here.</p><p>I want to revive my work - but I lost my tree somehow.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to get it going again when I have some cycles but really can&#039;t say when.&nbsp; If folks want to try, I can post the executable (built with RC4 SDK - not sure if it means anything or if it&#039;ll run on RC5).&nbsp; You can try to satisfy the dependencies and see if it works.</p><p>I did however notice that when pound starts, it has high CPU usage for initial few seconds.&nbsp; Then it runs fine.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t stress-tested or benchmark-tested though.</p><p>Thanks !</p>									</div>
