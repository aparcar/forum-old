					<p>It is handy to discern between LAN and WAN, although for the ToH, you can just state the amount of ports altogether and the speed. I certainly would not drop the speed, that is something people would filter for I think. Since a lot of models have 5 port switches that can be reconfigured with swconfig on OpenWrt, someone savvy enough can reconfigure his LAN/WAN ports as one wishes anyway.</p><p>No clue on the non-Ethernet ports, sorry. If there are non-Ethernet ports into play, then it does make sense to list the difference. The &#039;cleaner&#039; solution would be to have a separate column for the WAN port, but that would mean an extra column of course.</p>									</div>
