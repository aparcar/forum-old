					<p>I have two identical Western Digital MyNet 750 routers.</p><p>[edit] It has a 2.4 GHz radio that I use as a master, and a 5 GHz radio I use as a client.&nbsp; I use the routers as wireless repeaters and the WAN comes from the 5 GHz radio.&nbsp; [end edit]</p><p>I programmed one, BBold, a while ago with Barrier Breaker 14.07<br />I programmed another one, CCnew, today with Chaos Calmer 15.05</p><br /><br /><p>I have both configured as WiFi clients to the same source.&nbsp; In fact, I copied /etc/config/wireless from BBold to CCnew today.&nbsp; I used luci to adjust CCnew mode from legacy to N/40 MHz, because that seems to be a new feature for Chaos Calmer 15.05.&nbsp; But BBold connects at 40 MHz and CCnew connects at 20 MHz.</p><p>BBold has WiFi signal of -67 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp;noise of =-95 dBm<br />CCnew has WiFi signal of -43 dBm.&nbsp; noise of -95 dBm</p><p>BBold connects at 40 MHz bandwidth, in the 270-300 Mbit/s rate.<br />CCnew connects at 20 MHz bandwidth, in the 6 - 195 Mbit/s rate.</p><p>I thought that -43 dBm was a STRONGER signal than -67 dBm.&nbsp; The units are about the same distance from the source, but BBold is through flooring and CCnew is through air.</p><p>I&#039;ve got the same wireless config file, but the software version is different.&nbsp; Did 40MHz get locked out for chaos calmer?</p><p>I do not know the details of analysing or debugging wifi.&nbsp; Tell me what to google and I will.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Narrowband</strong> on 5 Jun 2016, 21:04)</p>
