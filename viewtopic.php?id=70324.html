					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I got two Archer C7 2.0, both did not boot. I was able to recover #1 with a serial connection and a TFTP setup.</p><p>Unfortunately, #2 does not give any activity on the TX line. After pressing the power button, the power LED and all five ethernet LEDs light up, power stays on and the other ones go off again. In fact, they glow very very dimly.<br />Imagine probing an LED with a multimeter on diode test, with a voltage just above U_threshold. That dim!</p><p>I wonder what is wrong with this unit, and of course how to recover it. Would it be possible to dump the flash contents with, for example, the Aardvark SPI programmer, and then write it to the dead unit?</p><p>How would you recover such a unit? Is it even recoverable?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I got it running again. At first I tried recovering it using my Aardvark SPI programmer, but it never detected the flash.<br />I also tried booting my functional archer, piggy-backed the dead flash to the intact one and severed both vcc and !cs.<br />Did not work either.</p><p>Then I got my segger j-link and tried that. Unfortunately the CPU is not supported by OpenOCD out of the box, so I followed the ath79 patch and had to merge the patch with the git repo files manually. It compiled and connected.</p><p>It took the whole night re-flashing the bootloader over jtag, with 4 byte/s. After that it worked like a charm again.</p>									</div>
