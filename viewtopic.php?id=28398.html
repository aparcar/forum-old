					<p>Hello</p><p>I got an iConnect for christmas (instead of the Seagate Dockstar, which I had hoped for...) and for the past few days I&#039;ve been trying to find out how to best get OpenWrt running on it.<br />I already have Serial access to the device and have read the various how-tos for the Dockstar. Is installation on the iConnect possible in the same way? Has anybody installed OpenWrt on the iConnect yet? Is everything working (according to the patches on the developer mailing list, most stuff should work)? Is it advisable to install OpenWrt to the NAND or an USB device?<br />I know that these are a lot of questions, but it&#039;s really difficult getting some good information on OpenWrt and the iConnect and a bit of help would be really appreciated. So if anybody here has managed to get it installed on his device, I&#039;d love to hear how that was accomplished. </p><p>Many thanks in advance and sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes, English is not my mother tongue,<br />steedalot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>steedalot</strong> on 30 Jan 2011, 19:32)</p>

					<p><a href="http://doip.org/iconnect">This page</a> has a lot of useful information. The author installed Debian on an iConnect, so it should certainly be possible to install OpenWrt using the same approach.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t advise it without a serial cable, though.</p><p>Please note that this forum is for posting HOWTO documents, not asking how-to questions ...</p>									</div>
