					<p>@RangerZ,</p><p>Not sure where you got your instructions or gdrive link from...</p><p>It&#039;s not that complicated. From the WIKI</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>UN-Official Pre-Built Images

Install OpenWrt on your MLWG2 using a USB stick or SDcard. 
This has been tested by others… 
As Always…. Use at your own Peril! … No Warranty! 
USB/SDcard Factory to OpenWrt and OpenWrt to Factory Images.

The OpenWrt Image has NO Password set! 
It has LuCI installed the WiFi is ENABLED by default and is set to &quot;OpenWrt&quot;.</code></pre></div><p>Content of README<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1) Put two files on a USB drive openwrt-ramips-mt7620n-mlwg2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin and a 0 byte file called mlwG2_v;telnetd; .x.x.bin

2) Plug the USB drive into the MLWG2 while it is OFF, now turn it ON

3) Wait for the MLWG2 to boot

4) telnet to 192.168.201.254 username &#039;admin&#039; password is blank.

5) mtd_write write /media/USB1/openwrt-ramips-mt7620n-mlwg2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin KernelA

6) mtd_write -r write /media/USB1/openwrt-ramips-mt7620n-mlwg2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin KernelB

7) Connect either via the OpenWrt SSID or the built-in ethernet port.

######################

To revert to Factory Junkware :

Use the LuCI webinterface &quot;Flash new firmware image&quot;

&quot;un&quot; check the save settings block.

Choose File : mlwG2_v2.0.0.8.bin

Flash Image and Proceed.</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;m sure CC RC3 image will work fine also instead of the one provided on the gdrive. However, I can&#039;t verify since my device has already been flashed. I did switch over to CC RC3 afterwards though.</p><p>It was a really a trivial install. I never even saw the default firmware or did anything with it. I switched to OpenWRT right after I opened the box.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>King0fK0ng</strong> on 21 Aug 2015, 01:44)</p>
