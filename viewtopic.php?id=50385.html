					<p>Hi,</p><p>Yesterday I&#039;ve bricked a router thanks to google (who thiks it&#039;s a relevant result the wdr4300 page if I google &quot;wdr4900&quot;), updating the wrong firmware. No recovery method worked for me (I&#039;ve managed to boot into recovery mode, power the router on while holding the reset buton; the router detect the correct firmware on mi tftp server and download it but nothing happened then, no reboot, nothing). So, I have to open it (I will never understand how hard is this router to open after removing the 4 screws.... why does it even come with screws?).</p><p>I&#039;ve followed the recovery mode on the wiki and it worked perfectly; I&#039;m so grateful that I&#039;ve felt like sharing a tip (or maybe it&#039;s not a tip, but it was for me). </p><p>The thing is I don&#039;t like welding, I&#039;m very bad at it, I didn&#039;t want to fry the router (I was worried because all the warnings and skull signs on every article I&#039;ve read about connecting the serial console) and I have to work with things I had at home (no electronics stores open at 11PM here, don&#039;t like going to bed with a bricked router). </p><p>So I came with the idea that maybe I could weld the tiny serial cable (I&#039;ve found at home the usb data cable of a nokia 1200/2760) with a bigger one, a solid copper one, and use it as a jumper connector. Of course, It must be a cable that fits in the serial console holes. This is what I did, and it worked:</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2lstjpu.jpg" alt="http://i62.tinypic.com/2lstjpu.jpg" /></span></p><br /><p>Hope it helps</p><br /><p>Regards!</p>									</div>
