					<p>Hello community.</p><p>I have purchased a WRT1900AC ver.1 and flashed 15.05.1 on it.</p><p>After installing some packages, I see I have about 3,6 MB free space.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s15.postimg.org/ota8ntrd7/1900ac_flash.png" alt="http://s15.postimg.org/ota8ntrd7/1900ac_flash.png" /></span></p><p>Is that normal?<br />Where is the rest of the <strong>128MB</strong> flash space and how can I use it?</p><p>And a second question:<br />I think I&#039;ve read something about a NAND patch.<br />What is that and what does it do?</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>The flash is divided into 2 partitions, allowing you to have two images. You can go back to a good image if things go South on you when you flash a new image. Best to read the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac">wiki</a> on how to get back to your previous image. And yes that number seems low for this device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi and thanks for your answer.</p><p>I suppose the second partition/rootfs contains the linksys/belkin oem firmware, is that right?<br />Is there a way to &quot;merge&quot; partitions or another way to increase the overlay partition (except extroot)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Think of flashing an image to a partition as a round-robin. When you flash an image it goes to the partition that is not current;i.e.the one you are not currently running. What is on the other partition is dependent on what was there when you last ran that partition. There are ways to flash to a particular partition if that is what you need; i.e. you want to keep an image as good, while you try out another image.</p><p>Not sure about merging the partitions. I suppose a modified boot loader would be possible. Don&#039;t think you should really need ti though. Plenty of resources on this device. I have a DD build with everything I need, lots of flash remaining. The usefulness of the dual partition structure would outweigh combining them in my opinion.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t understand what I am doing wrong. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I have flashed the router several times and it always ends up with <strong>26.28 MB</strong> root partition.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://s14.postimg.org/hizwqlv8h/1900_free_space.png" alt="http://s14.postimg.org/hizwqlv8h/1900_free_space.png" /></span></p><p>I think I&#039;ll wait for the latest 0.17 mwlwifi driver to be pushed in DD trunk and try a current image.<br />Thanks a lot for the information.</p>									</div>
