					<p>Hello,</p><p>hope someone can help me with my little Issue. Here is what i want to do:</p><p>I&#039;m using the GL-AR150 router von gl.inet to bridge an bluetooth interface (bt0) to another ethernet interface (eth2).<br />The bt0 interface is build like in the following link </p><p>visualgdb.com/tutorials/arm/nrf51/6lowpan/</p><p>and i get a successfull connection between my PC and the bluetooth Low Energy devices, so there is an connection between the bt0 interface and the br-lan interface. </p><p>Now i want to add another ethernet interface (eth2) to the br-lan bridge to forward the packets from the bt0 interface to eth2, but everytime I add the eth2 to the bridge with <strong>brctl addif br-lan eth2</strong> I&#039;m losing the connection to the devices on the bt0 interface. </p><p>Is there anyone that recognized the same behavior?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Steff</p>									</div>
