					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m interested in a working PCMCIA environment for whiterussian, so I started to port the stuff I found in the kamikaze branch to whiterussian. Has anybody experience with this?</p><p>Especially concerning the patches mentioned at the bottom of <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3276">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3276</a> </p><p>The patch 009 looks a litle like a dirty hack but I don&#039;t know enough about kernel PCMCIA stuff to understand what it actually does.</p><p>So far I have the pcmcia-cs package compiled as well as the pcmcia-core and pcmcia-serial module packages.</p><p>To test the stuff I have an Option UMTS-Card and a Novatel Merlin U630 but without the mentioned patches they don&#039;t work yet. I only see the USB-root-hub when I reboot with the option card pluged in:</p><p># lspci -v<br />[...]<br />02:00.0 USB Controller: OPTi Inc. 82C861 (rev 10) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subsystem: OPTi Inc. 82C861<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [virtual] Memory at 10000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)</p><p># lsusb<br />Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000</p><p>here should be found a usb-serial device which provides access to the card.<br />With the patches applied I&#039;m able to load the usbserial module with &quot;vendor=0xaf0 product=0x5000&quot; and get the devices needed to connect with pppd.</p><p>When I reboot with the merlin U630 nothing is recognized. Neither when I switch the cards while the router is running.<br />This card should be accessed directly by serial_cs but I did&#039;nt find any parameters yet to get it work. BTW this one is a 16-bit pc-card. Option builds cardbus cards.</p><p>If the kernel-stuff works stable I&#039;m willing to add a apropriate web interface to configure the stuff...</p>									</div>
