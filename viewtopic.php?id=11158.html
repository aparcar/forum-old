					<p>Hello everybody! This may be a little off topic. </p><p>I&#039;m trying to cross-compile squid for an ARM architecture, more specific, for a OMAP. I&#039;m using DENX 4.1 tool chain. I did compile a lot of packages. But I&#039;m having trouble with Squid. And i Really need to get it working. Someone at Squid recommended to ask how you did compile Squid, because it needs to run cf_gen, but cf_gen cannot be run because when cross-compiled cannot be run on the build system. </p><p>I can post a log. If needed. Thanks a lot in advance.</p>									</div>
