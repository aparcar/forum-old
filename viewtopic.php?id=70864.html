					<p>Hello to everyone!</p><p>I am new here but I believe here is a people who able to help. Many of you probably heard about UPC ISP and about their &quot;UPC Wi-Free&quot; 802.1x networks&nbsp; with certificate and username-password. I tried to configure but no luck and no conection.<br />I am trying to configure my (Xiaomi Mini 15.05) to be in a client mode (NAC) and then sharing interenet to house.<br />I have removed wpad-mini and installed usual/normal wpad. hostapd was already in firmware.<br />So far when I go to WiFi&gt;Scan (NAC networks) it shows me required network. I tried both fixed BSSID and removing it=same effect.<br />Then I set security according to instructions of UPC Czech Republic:<br />WPA2-EAS, PEAP, MSCHAP-V2, uploaded certificate and username+password</p><p>Result: No assigned clients. I also tried with BGN networks and I see that from times to times there is assigned &quot;client&quot; but NO IP.</p><p>I believe that I do something wrong but I need help. Please advice me what to do.</p>									</div>

Connected without problems. At the same time I don&#039;t have any WAN cable at home. Here is only this &quot;UPC Wi-Free&quot; in use. I am connected to router via RJ45 cable and I am not expecting to use WiFi at home beacause you said &quot;Wifi clients will not work in any sort of bridge interface.&quot;<br />So lets continue with usual 802.1x client mode what will be shared to usual ETH wired connection.</p>									</div>
