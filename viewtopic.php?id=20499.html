					<p>Hi!</p><p>I did not find a more appropriate subforum, so I post here.</p><p>After login, I noticed that all forums and post are marked as old, even those posted in the last hour (last time I logged in was yesterday, so they should have been marked as new, this is how it worked before).</p><p>Related, the posting times are wrong.</p><p>For the last post here, it said &quot;Today 16:03:52 by rcbos&quot; (topic&nbsp; Kamikaze on Routerboard 450G? by xcel).<br />I went to my profile and changed Timezone from &quot;+01 CET&quot; to &quot;+02&quot; (we have CET actually here, but it is 2 hours ahead of UTC).<br />Now it is even worse, it shows &quot;Today 17:03:52 by rcbos&quot;.<br />Real local time is 15:29. So the posts are either posted by a time machine or the forum has issues <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Regards,<br />David</p>									</div>
