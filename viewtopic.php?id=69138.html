					<p>Hi,<br />I have question, about static lease to Different IP Range for client.</p><p>Router Lan IP is 192.168.1.1.<br />Static Lease IP is 121.xxx.xxx.xxx</p><p>so, /etc/config/dhcp put the<br />config host<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option mac &#039;11:22:33:44:55:66&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ip 121.xxx.xxx.xxx</p><p>but client have ip is 192.168.1.188.<br />client tried ipconfig /renew, same result...<br />fw is Openwrt 14.07.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is 121.xxx.xxx.xxx the wan IP address of the fw? You can&#039;t use the same IP address on both the router and a client. Instead you may forward ports from the fw to the client.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s trying to redistribute its upstream WAN IP address to a client. It should be clear to everyone to be not possible.</p><p>Instead I guess he&#039;s trying to do something like this.<br />* Router has WAN address 121.xxx.0.2 within a /30 network.<br />* His provider routes in addition to that something like 121.xxx.1.0/29 to 121.xxx.0.2<br />* So this is a totally different network of 6 individual hosts that do not overlap the WAN network.<br />* He is trying to automatically distribute 121.xxx.1.0/29 to his internal network.<br />Which schould be posslble.</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html">http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/do â€¦ q-man.html</a><br />But it requires the internal network of OpenWRT to be set to whatever the provider routes you.</p><p>See section &quot;-G, --dhcp-host&quot;:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Addresses allocated like this are not constrained to be in the range given by the --dhcp-range option, but they must be in the same subnet as some valid dhcp-range. For subnets which don&#039;t need a pool of dynamically allocated addresses, use the &quot;static&quot; keyword in the dhcp-range declaration.</p></blockquote></div><p>The distinct per-host assignment needs to be within the IP range of the interface it assigned, which doesn&#039;t need to be the DHCP range. If there are no dynamic assignments, set mode to &quot;static&quot;. But that does not mean you&#039;re allowed to assign IP addresses &quot;out of range&quot; but only means &quot;the range only consists of static leases&quot;.</p><br /><p>So my suggstion.<br />* Set up a new, seprate vlan for the hosts you want public IP addresses assigned to.<br />* Make your public IP range the internal IP range of the private interface.<br />* Keep your static lease definition, it is fine. It just doesn&#039;t work at the moment because you&#039;re lacking the first two steps.<br />* For gods sake think hard about firwall rules. You don&#039;t want NAT for that vlan, you don&#039;t want to block DHCP request and response to your router. But you don&#039;t want to have those public IP addresses access your routers configuration and you don&#039;t want them to access your LAN either.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 29 Dec 2016, 21:16)</p>
