					<p>Hi, I&#039;m setting up OpenWRT on my Archer C7. I&#039;ve tested two different methods of file sharing, and found that NFS is up to 5 times faster than sshfs in some cases. However, I&#039;m concerned about the lack of security in NFS. Occasionally others use my network, and I&#039;d prefer not to let them access my shares. I&#039;m not 100% sure how guest networks work and if they could solve my problem.</p><ul><li><p>My router currently broadcasts two networks from the two 5 GHz and a 2.5 GHz radios. Is the purpose of guest networks to allow <em>simultaneous</em> broadcast? i.e. can I have an <em>additional</em> two networks (with distinct SSID and passwords)?</p></li><li><p>Can I only allow access to my NFS shares from a single pair of networks, denying access from the two guest networks?</p></li></ul><p>Thank you in advance.</p>									</div>

The reason I was investigating wireless storage is to backup laptops over the network. Currently, I just connect a hard drive via USB directly to the laptop, which takes 15 minutes to complete. I&#039;ve previously tried backing up remotely to our home server, but the throughput of my previous 802.11n router meant a backup took ~4 hours. Since upgrading to 802.11ac (and OpenWRT), I was firstly trying to optimise which protocol to use. I was then going to test how quick a backup would be. However, if you are curious, or you think it might be useful to others, I&#039;m happy to follow the instructions in the link. Just let me know.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Yes and this is also true even for Samba and/or perhaps all NAS systems our there that use many different software.

NFS can be secured with kerberos, but this seems fairly difficult to set up.</p><p>I now suspect it&#039;s not possible, but one theoretical way that NFS might work would be to restrict access to particular IP addresses, but not broadcast which addresses these were. ssh can be configured this way.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Honestly, I would not know the answer, unfortunately. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p></blockquote></div><p>No worries. Thank you for your help anyway. Hopefully someone else might be able to pipe in. Otherwise, I&#039;ll give it a shot anyway and report back.</p>									</div>

					<p>NFS should always be faster than SSHFS on many OpenWrt devices because SSHFS uses much, much more CPU resources. If you run top or htop on your OpenWrt device during a network transfer you will see what I mean. There are many things that influence write speeds. For example:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Protocol Overheard</p></li><li><p>CPU Power</p></li><li><p>Network Throughput</p></li><li><p>Media Write Speed</p></li></ul><p>Benchmarks on one device will be different on another device based on the above.</p><p>What I do is serve all my media files with anonymous, read only, NFS and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#Anonymous_FTP">anonymous ftp</a> using vsftp. Note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_%28software%29">Kodi</a> supports NFS on all platforms including Windows and Android. This gives me adequate performance to support multiple streams of 1080p movies with a minimal of CPU load. I don&#039;t care who accesses my media streams.</p><p>For files where I do care about access, I use sshfs. I typically don&#039;t transfer large files over sshfs.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vernonjvs</strong> on 20 May 2016, 07:08)</p>
