					<p>The build on myopenrouter.com is based on AA and the DSL seems to work on that one. You find it if you search D7800 on myopenrouter.com. Is there a way to upgrade from that build to the newer trunks and keep whatever firmware/drivers was making it work? Or at least figure out what those drivers were and install them over a newer build?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>I flashed openWRT on my d7800. After flashing is bricked. I cannot access router through 192.168.1.1 even if PC gets connected to the router and I can ping using CMD with TTL=64.</p><p>I tried TFTP to flash stock firmware. It does not work.</p><p>I used putty and I can login to root, but what commands should I use to reflash with stock firmware. I tried to find .bin for D7800 but everywhere .img only.</p><p>I flashed</p><p>openwrt-ipq806x-D7800-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>on my 1.0.1.31 stock firmware</p>									</div>

					<p>The good part, it&#039;s a lantiq (PSB80320) ADSL frontend - the bad part, it&#039;s just the ADSL frontend without the accompanying lantiq SOC (VRX320), no RAM, no flash, it appears to be driven solely from the IPQ8064 SOC. It doesn&#039;t help either that LEDE/ OpenWrt doesn&#039;t appear to support lantiq VRX320 in general so far.</p>									</div>
