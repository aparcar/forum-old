					<p>Hi all,</p><p>My provider provides IPv4 over PPPoE (that can be used to NAT the br-lan network), but in ADDITION they provide a subnet (/29) public IP addresses. Packets for this subnet are sent over the same PPPoE link but, instead of being used for NATting, these packets should just be sent to a different subnet.</p><p>I&#039;m by no means an expert on OpenWRT&#039;s IPchains and certainly not when combined with the OpenWRT configuration mechanism.</p><p>How would I set up a configuration like this?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Geert Jan</p>									</div>

					<p>It is fairly straightforward. I assume a default config here with pppoe wan, a dmz with public ip space and lan with private address space. Only thing you will need is add the masq_src option from zone wan in firewall config. This will only nat private range ip&#039;s.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option &#039;masq_src&#039; &#039;10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16&#039;</code></pre></div><p>You will still need to configure firewall rules to allow sessions. If you wish you could allow all traffic by simply adding:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config forwarding
    option src        dmz
    option dest    wan

config forwarding
    option src        wan
    option dest    dmz</code></pre></div><p>Edit: Allthough this will work, with this method you will lose 3 usable ip addresses (network- broadcast- and gateway address) as you configure the public /29 to an ethernet interface. If you were to use nat, you can nat all 8 addresses to private address ip&#039;s and thus create more useable space.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adze</strong> on 10 Mar 2015, 21:12)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the answer. I will try later this week (make is currently running).</p><p>As to the missing 3 addresses, I have an idea I want to try:<br />I got a /29.<br />I will assign the network a /27, overlapping the /29.<br />The clients will have a default route to a broadcast&nbsp; IP outside of my /29, with the MAC-address hardcoded to the OpenWRT box.</p><p>Systems will have a default route, and two static routes, one for the /29 I do not have, one for the /28 I do not have.<br />Since &quot;longest prefix wins&quot;, packets to these addresses will follow these routes and not ARP on my own network.<br />This way, I should be able to use all 8 addresses - I&#039;ve done something similar with NetBSD a long time ago.</p><p>If it works, I&#039;ll put the info on the wiki for people to share.</p><p>Thanks for the config example - strange as it may sound, I could not work that out and earlier attempts didn&#039;t work for me.</p><p>Geert Jan</p>									</div>

					<p>It took longer than expected, but I have it working, and added a twist that may be interesting enough to post about it.</p><p>In brief, my provider&nbsp; provides (for a surcharge) a /29 subnet of public IP addresses, So it is possible to connect servers <br />and other kit (like RIPE ATLAS probes) and have them use real public IP addresses..</p><p>While the receipt above did work (and work well - thanks!), one remaining problem was that of the 8 addresses in the /29,<br />I&#039;d loose 3 (network number, broadcast number, IP for the router), and the loss of 37% address space seemed excessive.<br />So I did a few tricks documented here.</p><p>It is important to realize that only the 8 IP addresses themselves need to be public IP addresses; the broadcast and network number<br />do not, they have no real significance off-subnet (directed subnet broadcasts don&#039;t really exist anymore, these days) and obviously<br />the router IP doesn&#039;t need to be reachable either. While it is possible to overlay a local plan and squat addresses not belonging to me<br />(belonging to other *DSL customers), the aim is to have real, full IP connectivity w/o holes.</p><p>The approach sketched earlier did not work well: it required changes in the systems connected to the network and the network,<br />broadcast, and router IP&#039;s would still be holes. I considered spoofing ARP responses, but found that the proxy-ARP implementation <br />in Linux really wants an address on-network and besides, since the VDSL modem firmware does not support mini-jumbograms <br />and the IP uses PPPoE, my MTU was slightly reduced and having an IP to send PMTU packets was desirable.<br />More work was required.</p><p>A few years back I had a chat with one of the techs there (hi, maarten!) and he explained that, for backward compatibility reasons<br />with broken IP stacks of old Windows systems, they didn&#039;t allocate IP&#039;s where the last octet was either 0 or 255. Indeed, there were<br />no PTR records for these, and there were for other IP&#039;s.</p><p>I decided that if I would configure the subnet network-interface to be a /23, that the network and broadcast IP&#039;s would now<br />overlay the addresses not used by the ISP. And there were 2 IP&#039;s in the middle that were not used either (/23, remember?),<br />which I could abuse for an IP for a router.</p><p>I would need to add routes for the address space not mine, back to the provider (&#039;pppoe-wan&#039;), <br />and enable proxy-ARP on the interface. A client ARP-ing for an address in the encapsulated space that&#039;s not mine,<br />would get an ARP response to the OpenWRT router, the router would send it to the ISP, job done!</p><p>Example, to make things clear. Unfortunately publishing a single IP address attracts network scans these days,<br />so&nbsp; have substituted the first two octets of my address with the illegal 654.321.</p><p>My subnet:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 654.321.100.88/29<br />Overlay subnet: 654.321.100.0/23&nbsp; (hence: network: 654.321.100.0, bcast 654.321.101.255)<br />Router IP:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 654.321.101.0<br />ISP iface:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pppoe-wan<br />subnet iface:&nbsp; &nbsp;br-vas</p><br /><p># cat /etc/hotplug.d/iface/31-vashack<br />#!/bin/sh</p><p>[ &quot;$ACTION&quot; == &quot;ifup&quot; ] || exit 0</p><p>[ &quot;$INTERFACE&quot; = &quot;wan&quot; ] &amp;&amp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ip route replace 654.321.100.0/26&nbsp; &nbsp;dev pppoe-wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ip route replace 654.321.100.64/28&nbsp; dev pppoe-wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ip route replace 654.321.100.80/29&nbsp; dev pppoe-wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ip route replace 654.321.100.96/27&nbsp; dev pppoe-wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ip route replace 654.321.100.128/25 dev pppoe-wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ip route replace 654.321.101.0/24&nbsp; &nbsp;dev pppoe-wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.br-vas.proxy_arp=1<br />}</p><p>The cool thing is that I can even set up DHCP for these 8 public IP addresses,<br />and the right thing happens, no client configuration required.</p><p>This is still a hack, and the proper fix is just to run IPv6, but if I&#039;ve amused someone<br />then I&#039;m happy.</p><p>Geert Jan</p><p>PS: should this be in wiki or is it better left undocumented?</p>									</div>
