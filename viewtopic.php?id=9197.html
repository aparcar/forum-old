					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am using a linksys box with openwrt (whiterussian RC5) and openvpn to create a bridge.<br />When the box has finished booting and openvpn starts sending the keep alive packets, after about 20 seconds, it goes crazy and starts sending the vpn packets through tap0 and therefore starts an infinite loop where the packets just keep being encapsulated.<br />(This was verified by not using any encryption for the vpn and looking at what was being sent)<br />If I kill openvpn and run it by hand, in some cases, it will behave the same way and in others, it will start behaving normally (i.e. send a keep alive every 10 seconds)</p><p>When it goes &#039;crazy&#039;, the routing table is correct, the arp table is also correct, the bridges are as they should be and honestly, I do not understand what&#039;s going on, so if anyone out there can help me understand what the problem is, I would be most grateful.</p><p>The openvpn config on the box is:</p><p>dev tap0<br />proto udp<br />remote xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 1194<br />port 1194<br />keepalive 10 120<br />cipher none<br />verb4</p><p>Also, the box is sitting behind a server with only itself on the subnet</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Phil</p>									</div>
