					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWrt on a TP-Link WR841ND (V10) router. Although I disabled IPv6 functionality, as you can see on this <a href="http://postimg.org/image/5hu68xue3/">screenshot</a>, plenty of IPv6 route entries are being shown, as you can see on those Screenshots:<br /><a href="http://postimg.org/image/wpghq957t/">IPv6 routes 1</a><br /><a href="http://postimg.org/image/62l7rsu5f/">IPv6 routes 2</a><br /><a href="http://postimg.org/image/v8on3tzo9/">IPv6 routes 3</a></p><p>Here are the links to my <a href="http://pastebin.com/bMvXN3Bt">System Log</a> and to my <a href="http://pastebin.com/CJXdqZxX">dmesg output</a>, if this could be of any help.</p><br /><p>Is it normal that all those IPv6 routes are being displayed? And how is this possible at all after having disabled IPv6 functionality using the OpenWrt GUI?</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance and best wishes</p><p>David</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ultra.enigma</strong> on 14 Dec 2015, 06:24)</p>

					<p>Then the second issue is that I permanently get ARP-spoofed from my local subnet (I&#039;m living in a dormitory), one of those IP being IP 10.0.22.231, as you can see here:<br /><a href="http://postimg.org/image/cq6vso7lb/">ARP spoofing</a></p><p>Now I thought that there would basically be two possibilities in order to avoid this:<br />1) Setting up static routes?

					<p>Still nobody having any idea about this strange phenomenon? </p><p>Please give me some advice how I could 1) prevent ARP spoofing using Openwrt [either by configuring static routes - except the 10.022.231 route all routing entries are legitimate, so they could be configured as static routes I guess OR by letting OpenWrt perform &quot;ip - s - s neigh flush all&quot; every second]&nbsp; and 2) how I could configure static IPv6 routes which would lead all IPv6 traffic into digital nirvana, considering those more than strange IPv6 routes being displayed.

					<p>Presume for a second that the issue is on the upstream side, i.e. your WAN port. All you care about is that packets sent from your WAN interface are sent through the switches directly to your upstream router, i.e. default gateway.

By the way, that would imply that they would use really outdated routers/switches, if those could be ARP-spoofed.

					<p>Yes, VPN (or SSL) will render the intercept useless.</p><p>There are bugs and security vulnerabilities in every platform; keeping up-to-date with firmware, as you imply, will certainly help. However IMO basic NAT based firewalls are fairly robust from the outside. Enabling management from external interface will expose far more issues.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&nbsp; now manually deleted the wan6 interface and it doesn&#039;t show up in LuCI anymore. However, there is still an IPv6 route (multicast, nothing to worry about) - How is that possible? </p><p>I did a research on this &quot;How to ultimately disable any kind of&nbsp; IPv6 functionality on Linux systems&quot; a while ago already and already got the impression that the only way to do so would be by compiling a kernel without IPv6 support.</p>									</div>
