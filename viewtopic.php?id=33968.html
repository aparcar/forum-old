					<p>I followed up the steps on this website and forum for doing a build for this router. i was able to complete the build but since the source code does not have machine configuration for this router i tried installing<br />D-Link DIR-300 B1 (similar specs) and it worked (except incorrect led notification, incorrect LAN port mapping i had to use LAN 2 for my WAN connection, no wifi, no web admin). other wise i was able to do ssh , ping telnet external network using wired connection.</p><p>Can someone please point me&nbsp; point in correct direction (links etc ) for creating correct configuration for this router. maybe modify the existing DIR-300 B1 configuration.</p><p>DD-WRT has a build for this router but is too big to support python for serial port communication. i tired firmware modification kit but no good, the resulting ROM is too big for this router.<br />The source code for DD-WRT is too big for my data plan to download and do a fresh build.</p><p>My Primary requirement is to read sensor data from serial port and send it over TCP/IP over WiFi. i do not require any other functionality at all.</p><p>Any help is much appreciated from the community</p><p>--Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the effort.</p><p>Because your RT-N10+ seems to use the same Edimax Board than the Getnet GR-124W i still have on the attic i might try to flash it with your config.<br />Except the Getnet has only 16MB Ram.</p>									</div>

					<p>Did anybody tested it with &quot;RT-N10&quot; (B, NON-PLUS!). Since it&#039;s name is a sub-string it&#039;s hard to find information on still RT-N10; and it&#039;s chars seems very similar to this one.</p>									</div>
