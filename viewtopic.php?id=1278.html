					<p>Hi.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s possible to use the ping exploit/bug to enable the full 32MB ram my router appears to have?<br />I&#039;m running Linksys firmware at the moment, and don&#039;t have plans to switch right now.</p><p>Can I do it by replacing the boot_wait trick:<br />;cp${IFS}*/*/nvram${IFS}/tmp/n<br />;*/n${IFS}set${IFS}boot_wait=on<br />;*/n${IFS}commit<br />;*/n${IFS}show&gt;tmp/ping.log</p><p>with:<br />;cp${IFS}*/*/nvram${IFS}/tmp/n<br />;*/n${IFS}set${IFS}sdram_init=0x0008<br />;*/n${IFS}set${IFS}sdram_ncdl=0x0000<br />;*/n${IFS}commit<br />;*/n${IFS}show&gt;tmp/ping.log</p><p>?</p><p>I&#039;m sure my router has 32MB. I used a flashlight to find the partnumber on the ramchips, which is is42s16800a-7t, and they&#039;re 8Mx16 chips &lt;==&gt; 16MB each ==&gt; 32MB in total.</p><p>/Istvan</p><p>Those of you who have ISSI chips and are interested, I&#039;m quite sure it&#039;s the 8 (8th character) in the partnumber string that tells it&#039;s a 8M chip. The strings for v1 to v2 in <a href="http://www.linksysinfo.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=6#table">http://www.linksysinfo.org/modules.php? … id=6#table</a> says they are 4M chips &lt;==&gt; 8MB each &lt;==&gt; 16MB in total.<br />The v2.2 in the same table, has a 8Mx16 chip &lt;==&gt; 16MB chip, but it only has 1 chip ==&gt; 16MB in total (error in the table claiming 32MB). For v2.2 and v3, you need to have a 16Mx16 chip to make it a 32MB router.</p><p>But I think the only lucky ones are those with &quot;newer&quot; v2 routers.<br />I guess just before Linksys was switching to single ramchips (16MB) in the v2.2 design, and ran out of 8MB ramchips, they used 16MB chips on the v2 routers.</p>									</div>

					<p>The commands shown are correct. Assuming you can fit those in the ping field and that the ping bug hasn&#039;t been fixed in the firmware you&#039;re running, it should work.</p><p>Just as a reminder, we don&#039;t provide any support for the stock firmware on this forum; you&#039;ll have to resolve any issues regarding the ping bug yourself.</p>									</div>

I have the same chips on mine...</p><p>After a tip on another forum, I loaded Batbox onto the router and changed the nvram values and rebooted. And now I have 32MB enabled on my router.</p><p>To clarify what I meant about the flashlight... I used it to lit up the inside of the router through the holes on the top, so I didn&#039;t have to open it and break the warrenty sticker. On my v2, the ramchips were where the holes begin in front-right side.</p><br /><p>Memory information</p><p>total: used: free: shared: buffers: cached:<br />Mem: 31453184 12652544 18800640 0 2080768 6393856<br />Swap: 0 0 0<br />MemTotal: 30716 kB<br />MemFree: 18360 kB<br />MemShared: 0 kB<br />Buffers: 2032 kB<br />Cached: 6244 kB<br />SwapCached: 0 kB<br />Active: 4100 kB<br />Inactive: 5716 kB<br />HighTotal: 0 kB<br />HighFree: 0 kB<br />LowTotal: 30716 kB<br />LowFree: 18360 kB<br />SwapTotal: 0 kB<br />SwapFree: 0 kB</p>									</div>
