					<p>I&#039;m new to this.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a wireless system that is feature rich, RELIABLE and fast(fast CPU).&nbsp; What are the recommendations?&nbsp; Want to use for a distribution system in my area.&nbsp; Primarily in the 5gig range. Will need a router(access point) and receivers for each location.&nbsp; Must be able to accept an external directional antenna.&nbsp; Better still if it can handle wide temps, but I can deal with that via an enclosure.</p><p>Have had lots of trouble with Linksys failures so will stay away from this unless someone can convince me otherwise.</p><p>Thanks very,<br />Sam</p>									</div>
