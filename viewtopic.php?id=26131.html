					<p>Hi there,</p><p>i tried to install openwrt on my linksys wrt54g v1.1. As described in the wiki I chose the simplest way - through the upgrade-firmware-mechanism of the standard firmware of the router. The openwrt image i tried is openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin.</p><p>Current state: the process terminated &quot;successfully&quot;, I restarted the router, power led ist blinking and the DMZ led is on.</p><p>I tried to start the &quot;recovery-mode&quot; by pressing the reset button as soon as the dmz led is getting on, but nothing happens.</p><p>The package sniffer tells me: &quot;&nbsp; Please&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot; via udp on port 4919.</p><p>Has anybody an idea how to get the router running again?</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p><p>Christian</p>									</div>

					<p>Take a look at <a href="http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/inbox/wrt54gl.recovery">http://nuwiki.openwrt.org/inbox/wrt54gl.recovery</a></p><p>I used &#039;Last Resort Recovery&#039; the other day to fix my system. Note that you must use .bin files and not .trx files. I would also use Tomato or the original Linksys firmware just to get the system up.</p><p>I have Vista with a (Oracle VirtualBox) virtual machine of Debian. I also am connected through another router such that my link doesn&#039;t go down (to solve that problem you may have to look at some other forums). I used the instructions from the recovery page in my debian vm to do the tftp.</p><p>The Tomato firmware was then loaded and running at 192.168.1.1. I then flashed the Tomato firmware to the router. I also chose to do a thorough erase (just to get rid of any old OpenWRT settings). I can now use the router again, and I will soon start to re-attempt using OpenWRT...</p>									</div>
