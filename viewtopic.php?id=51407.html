					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have an OpenWRT installation which connects to a wifi network as a client. I cannot ping it from anywhere else in the LAN using the hostname. Windows ping/browsers do not find the host. Windows nslookup does:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>C:\&gt;nslookup openwrt

How do I make for example &quot;http://openwrt&quot; accessible from a browser? &quot;<a href="http://192.168.0.136">http://192.168.0.136</a>&quot; works.</p><p>Entry in /etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;

					<p>Well if you want the easy way, enter it manually into your hosts file. That works around the problem though it doesn&#039;t fix it.</p><p>As for fixing it - if nslookup finds it then ping should find it too - I&#039;ve never seen a case where one works without the other, since they both use the same procedure to resolve the hostname.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, that&#039;s not what&#039;s wrong. It&#039;s the rest of the config that we need to know, i.e. how are your devices <em>behind</em> the router connected. Is it acting as a DHCP and DNS server itself or forwarding the requests? If so how? Or do you have nothing connected to it at all?</p>									</div>

					<p>I know it&#039;s over two years, but I still like to propose a solution since I stumbled over this problem too and found this thread via Google.</p><p>I, too had the problem, that nslookup resolves the hostname but can&#039;t ping the hostname. I am using fixed values for my IPv4 settings and I decided to change to &quot;automatic&quot;. And with that I could ping my custom hostnames. But I don&#039;t want to change this to automatic, so I investigated further.</p><p>I saw a little difference in ipconfig:<br />with automatic it said: Connection-specific DNS Suffix&nbsp; . : lan<br />with fixed ip settings:&nbsp; Connection-specific DNS Suffix&nbsp; . : </p><p>Yes, it was empty. I then did go to Network Connections -&gt; rightclick on Ethernet -&gt; properties. Then click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and again click on Properties. Then click on &quot;Advanced&quot; in bottom right corner. Then click on the tab called &quot;DNS&quot;. At the bottom there is an entry &quot;DNS suffix for this connection:&quot; , this is where you have to enter your suffix. Mine was &quot;lan&quot;. Now I can ping my custom hostnames.</p>									</div>
