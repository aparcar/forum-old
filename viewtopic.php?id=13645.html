					<p>I am having issues my WAN interface on a RT210 board (broadcom 4710).&nbsp; I could not get udhcpc to get an IP, so I tried static.&nbsp; Looking at the packets I see that nobody is responding to my arp requests at all.&nbsp; I have a got feeling its a vlan issue but I&#039;m not that familiar with the openwrt vlan configuration.&nbsp; </p><p>From looking at my network configuration via ifconfig and /etc/config/network, I don&#039;t appear to be using VLANS at all.&nbsp; Ifconfig shows 4 interfaces - br-lan, eth0, eth1, lo - all are UP.&nbsp; The lan side (br-lan and eth0) work fine, only the wan side (eth1) has issues.&nbsp; When I tcpdump the wan (eth1) I see network traffic from other machines on my network in addition to my arp requests (when trying static ip) and dhcp requests (when configured for dhcp) - I just never get responses, as if I am being completely ignored on the network.</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; thoughts?</p><p>Keep in mind I am rather new to OpenWRT so please bear with..</p>									</div>
