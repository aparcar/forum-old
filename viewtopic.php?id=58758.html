					<p>Okay I&#039;m hoping that it&#039;s just something I&#039;m doing without realizing it, but it seems that my router is often &#039;forgetting&#039; the OpenWRT firmware and reverting back to the Linksys firmware randomly after a power cycle.</p><p>What makes it even more odd, aside from having reflashed it a few times, is that it appears that the settings are still retained (at least until I install OpenWRT again, then I have to redo the settings).</p><p>Anyone else experiencing this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you running trunk?&nbsp; I had something similar happen on my WRT1200AC after reverting to stock and then going back to OpenWrt again.&nbsp; When you say it&#039;s reverting, what do you mean by that?&nbsp; In my case, the weirdness was that I after I had reverted to the stock firmware, when I flashed OpenWrt back onto it, the device did not reboot, and after 10 minutes or so, I had to manually restart it with the power switch.&nbsp; It appeared to be running in a hybrid mode (which was probably just browser-side caching) where it would give me a brief, black, Luci screen and then jump to the stock Linksys web interface.&nbsp; I resolved it by flashing OpenWrt via the Linksys interface again, and then immediately ssh&#039;ing into the device and installing Luci via opkg.</p><p>Or is it that after a power cycle, you cannot ssh into the device, and it is in fact the case that the Linksys firmware and all of its settings have been restored?</p><p>Did you install Luci after flashing OpenWrt?&nbsp; The fact that you say your settings are retained may indicate that browser-side caching is giving you the strange phenomenon when you access it via the web interface, but that the only issue is that Luci is not yet installed.&nbsp; The trunk builds will not come with it.&nbsp; Not sure about RC3, but I doubt it.</p><p>I&#039;ve not had any issues whatsoever since then (save needing to replace the mwlwifi driver with the latest from @yuhhaurlin &amp; @kaloz.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 30 Jul 2015, 20:05)</p>

					<p>Yup getting the same, and it&#039;s annoying. Flashed to OpenWRT as the Linksys firmware would only give about 10MB/s on ac, getting 41 MB/s on OpenWRT ac. But if I reboot the router sometimes it will revert to the old Linksys firmware and I can only then login via the linksys wifi website. This is using Chaos Calmer r45573.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought I had updated this topic to mention that I wasn&#039;t experiencing the issue anymore but I guess I didn&#039;t.</p><p>What file are you flashing with?&nbsp; Also do you have a way to connect using USB/TTL?&nbsp; You might try flashing both the primary and alternate memories to see if that clears the issue up.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just recently switched to OpenWRT, and I&#039;m suffering from this on a WRT1900AC v1.</p><p>*EDIT*</p><p>So it seems that every 3 reboots of the device, it goes back to the Linksys firmware. I&#039;m not sure what the cause is yet, but that&#039;s what it seems to be.
