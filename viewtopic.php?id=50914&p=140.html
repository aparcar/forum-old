					<p>I set behind a ATT Uverse Residential Gateway with router in the DMZ. Yes the router has to have a different IP address range from the ATT modem. What I do is readdress the ATT RG to 192.168.0.254. Then I do not need to readdress the router when I load a new firmware as I can now use the default of 192.168.1.1.</p><p>--bill</p>									</div>

I didn&#039;t and I had to re-flash as I completely borked my router and filled it to the brim! </p><p>Also: Arok&#039;s build has a nice GUI mount option where you can specify the root FS to be booted from a USB without having to do a TON of CLI stuff if you&#039;re not comfortable with that. When I first did it a year and a half ago though, there was no options like that. Or I didn&#039;t pay attention and just followed the steps in link 1 above!</p><p>Question 2&#039;s answer:<br />Jumbo frames setting - Click on &#039;Networking - Switch&#039; and click the box for &quot;Enable Jumbo Frame Passthrough&quot;... BAM - done. </p><p>Caution: It&#039;s best practice to ensure every device in your network supports Jumbo frames, as a device that doesn&#039;t will DROP the packets/data being transferred too it. Currently, my 8 port Netgear Pro switch and this WNDR3700 support it, as does my Ubuntu Server (due to hardware, Nics) and my gaming machine. My other devices do not so they transfer things at normal speeds which is still 70-90Mbps anyway! With Jumbo Frames though, it&#039;s bursting the CAT cable at the seams almost and pushing 90-110Mbps. Theoretical max is 112Mbps I believe on GB.</p><p>I was really considering a new router until I put this latest build on here... Forget it. Why waste the $200-$350 depending on which router. I&#039;ll move to AC when the rest of my devices support it, and these builds <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
