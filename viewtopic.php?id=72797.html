					<p>I&#039;ve been learning this all of 2 weeks. I blew up the LEDE firmware Admin GUI and the only access I have is via a terminal.</p><p>I&#039;ve read about using scp to send files to debrick but haven&#039;t found specific instructions. This is a TP-Link Archer C7 v2 wifi-router.</p><p>Mr. Adams how to is beyond the scope of my technical knowledge. Does setting an IP outside of the Linux issued one need to be changed back after the debricking, etc. </p><p>The Youtube vid&#039;s creator, cited below, assumes you have /docroot. I cannot find that via cd /docroot.</p><p>The OpenWRT forum for this device has a OP of 38 pages and I&#039;ve not found much helpful info. Good read though. I get the TFTP, but I&#039;m not able to get it to xfer.</p><p>Can someone point to a URL or how-to? Please.</p><p>Sources consulted:<br />Board won&#039;t let me post the links I&#039;ve used for research.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I have used my Linux VM and sent the firmware file directly to the router. I cant remember how but maybe you can google it. I think it should be in the wiki somewhere. And @eduperez is also right and it might help you re-install the firmware. After you successfully flash the firmware, the IP might be changed back to 192.168.1.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>If OpenWrt boots and you can ssh to it, run <strong>firstboot</strong> to reset to default settings. This should bring back LuCI if it was part of the original flash image.&nbsp; If you flashed a trunk image, you will need to install LuCI again.</p>									</div>
