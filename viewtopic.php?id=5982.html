					<p>You can try to kill some applications that are not needed to free the RAM, i.e. kill -KILLALL &lt;Process ID&gt;. Please be very carefully to kill any running process as this may cause the system to become very unstable and/or crashes. Be sure you know what you are doing.</p>									</div>
