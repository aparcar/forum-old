					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I spent some time over the weekend and managed to get OpenWRT working on my WGT634U. It &#039;almost&#039; does everything I need now (basically I want a way of backing up over the LAN, and streaming music to a Netgear MP101).</p><p>The only outstanding issue I have is with the USB. It recogises the two disks fine, but I cannot mount them for some reason. The two discs are both&nbsp; Maxtor Onetouch USB if that helps, one is 180Gb, the other 320Gb, both formatted FAT32).</p><p>I&#039;ve listed what I am attempting to do below. First &#039;ls&#039; on the drive to show the partitions, then try to mount to the /mnt directory (which does exist). I suspect that I am either using the wrong mount command, or I am missing a file system of some sort.</p><p>I am still very much a Linux newbie, so be gentle.</p><p>All the best, and thanks in advance for any advice.</p><p>Tony.</p><br /><p>root@OpenWrt:/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0# ls<br />disc&nbsp; &nbsp;part2&nbsp; part5</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0# mount /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part2 /mnt</p><br /><p>attempt to access beyond end of device<br />sda2: rw=0, want=66, limit=2<br />isofs_fill_super: bread failed, dev=sda2, iso_blknum=16, block=32<br />attempt to access beyond end of device<br />sda2: rw=0, want=68, limit=2<br />attempt to access beyond end of device<br />sda2: rw=0, want=1252, limit=2<br />attempt to access beyond end of device<br />sda2: rw=0, want=1028, limit=2<br />UDF-fs: No partition found (1)<br />attempt to access beyond end of device<br />sda2: rw=0, want=8, limit=2<br />XFS: SB read failed<br />mount: Mounting /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/part2 on /mnt failed: Input/output error<br />root@OpenWrt:/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0#</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s devfs, so the disks will show up as /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc and such.
