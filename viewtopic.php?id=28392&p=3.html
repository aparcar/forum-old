					<p>Actually, earlier today I happened to be trying your previous 26869 Backfire build, and was having a lot of trouble with a Mac holding an association. It would connect and complete the WPA2 handshake, but within a few minutes the router would log &quot;disassociated due to inactivity&quot;. I had to toggle the wireless on the Mac to get a new connection, and it would repeat. I tried your trunk 26869 build too, same result. So, I backed out to the previous 26472 that I was previously running, no issues after the downgrade. </p><p>There weren&#039;t any older builds on your site to try to bisect where the problem crept in, and I&#039;ll try the new build, but I assume you&#039;ve not seen this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Whoa - right you are. Moving over to an Ubuntu/Firefox browser I see the graphs and stats no problem. Or, turning off compatibility mode in IE9 for the LuCI pages, I see them too. I had turned IE9 compat mode on because the login page doesn&#039;t render well, and a few LuCI pages too. Looks like I will just leave it off. Thanks for the tip.</p>									</div>

					<p>Has anybody seen stability issues regarding recent ar71xx / WNDR3700 trunk builds (r27840 or later)?

Then the router dies totally and reboots, blinking the leds like in a normal boot process (except that there is no initial phase with the single orange led). Weirdly, the kernel log and system log do not show the complete boot session, but only a few network related items added to the old logs. Uptime gets reseted. I have not been able to reproduce this always, so it seems to be semi-random. After the crash, the traffic returns normal.&nbsp; (Only wired LAN is use, no WLAN connections although WLAN is active in router.)</p><p>I am going to build versions without those patches, and see if I can identify the possible suspect.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 10 Aug 2011, 12:51)</p>

					<p>The previous build &#039;trunk-r27944-2011-08-09-without-suspect-netfilter-patches&#039; from August 9th was built without those 601-, 611-, 612- and 613-patches was rock solid for two days, so I am still inclined to believe that one of four those patches might have caused instability in the previous few builds in August.</p><p>For the next version &#039;trunk-r27959-2011-08-11-without-suspect-610-611-netfilter-patch&#039; I included patches 612 and 613, as they look more simple and risk free (no pointers etc. in source code) than the other two. I left out 611-netfilter_match_bypass_default_table.patch and 610-netfilter_match_bypass_default_checks.patch, which are more complicated. So far, after a couple of hours and a few gigabytes of heavy traffic, the build still looks ok. QoS works well and nice throughput in general.</p><p>If that build works ok for a while, I will try to further narrow the possible problem in the next build.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, all the trunk builds have been stable since August 9th, even with the &quot;suspect&quot; patches included, so I guess that there was something else that has now been (hopefully) fixed.</p>									</div>
