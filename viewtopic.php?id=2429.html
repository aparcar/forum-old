					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have 3 PC-s at home, and i would like to share the bandwith. I want low latencies even if other computers are downloading.

					<p>the theory of traffic shapeing inbound traffic.</p><p>if your ISP will also run QOS on their end of the link you can readily shape incomeing traffic.</p><p>if they won&#039;t (or won&#039;t give you control of it) then you are very limited in what you can do with inbound traffic.</p><p>since you don&#039;t directly control when the packets are sent you can&#039;t prevent the inbound traffic from completely flooding you link (even if the traffic is all going to be denied by your firewall settings, it has to get to the firewall before you can decide you don&#039;t care about it)</p><p>however there is a trick that can be pulled.</p><p>since TCP adapts it&#039;s sending rate to the bandwidth of the link, if you don&#039;t acknowledge the incomeing packets as quickly as you can fool the remote side into thinking that it&#039;s on a slower link, this doesn&#039;t do any good for UDP traffic, and your gateway device needs to take a lot of things into account when decideing how long to delay the acknowledgement (and the machine on the far side will periodicly try to increase the speed so you will end up useing a little more bandwidth then you expect), and you need to account for how many connections are in use to the one internal destination (or your limiting gets bypassed by just opening up more connections in parallel)</p><p>most traffic shapeing options don&#039;t go to this sort of effort, they just limit the outbound traffic and don&#039;t try to play these more complicated games with the inbound stuff. This is why in most cases you need control of the settings on both ends of the link so that things don&#039;t get sent on the slow link unless you want them there.</p>									</div>

I have not seen any ,,30 sec delay&#039;&#039;, just well shaped downloads.</p><p>&quot;RED statistically drops packets from flows before it reaches its hard limit. This causes a congested backbone link to slow more gracefully, and prevents retransmit synchronization. This also helps TCP find its &#039;fair&#039; speed faster by allowing some packets to get dropped sooner keeping queue sizes low and latency under control. The probability of a packet being dropped from a particular connection is proportional to its bandwidth usage rather than the number of packets it transmits.&quot;</p><p>However:</p><p>&quot;RED isn&#039;t a cure-all for this, applications which inappropriately fail to implement exponential backoff still get an unfair share of the bandwidth, however, with RED they do not cause as much harm to the throughput and latency of other connections.&quot;</p><p>My main problem was, that the P2P and other downloads overloaded our incoming line, so gaming, web browsing, ssh was slow (big latency).

					<p>From my experience, it does help greatly with multiple computers.&nbsp; Now, my experience is only from using it for about a week, but I can make vonage phone calls w/ no problems while downloading using edonkey, with no restrictions set in edonkey.&nbsp; previously I had to limit the upload speed to 50k using the settings in edonkey, which slowed down my downloads to less than max.&nbsp; Now I can let it go, and wondershaper is handling that beautifully.</p><p>I can also surf the web with any slowdown being unoticeable, as well as IRC.</p><p>My understanding is that SFQ gives all connections a fair portion of downloads...&nbsp; And the more bandwidth a connection is using, the more packets are dropped from it to bring the total downloads into line with the max if necessary, so while there is no individual queue for each computer, it does seem to allocate bandwidth fairly, while allowing one computer to consume more if none of the others are using it.</p><p>Other than the fact that occassionally my ssh connections have a bit of lag, I&#039;m pretty happy with it, overall.</p>									</div>
