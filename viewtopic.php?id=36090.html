					<p>A a few days ago a friend gave me an old TP_Link tl-wr841n he broke trying to update its firmware. Dont know exactly what he did, but now the device starts but doesnt respond to ping or let me log in. Is there any way to save it? Im planning to get an USB stick, but would be better to have an AP (specially a free one). It is made in China and the label reports &quot;Version 2&quot;.</p>									</div>
