					<p>Hi. I tried Openwrt and found it a very good firmware, far better than the original firmware. But on an USR 5461, there is a problem: with only 2 mb flash rom, i can&#039;t install any additional package, which I need.<br />So, i decided to restore my USR 5461 to the original firmware. But, having only an .usr file, which I found on the producer&#039;s website, i can&#039;t restore it.&nbsp; Openwrt doesn&#039;t accept it as a valid firmware.<br />I tried to convert it to a .trx file, using the same process used with .bin files, but it didn&#039;t work. <br />Doesn&#039;t anyone have a backup of the original firmware as a &quot;.trx&quot; file?<br />Any help would be appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bafe</strong> on 22 Nov 2008, 19:57)</p>

					<p>You can download the latest USR-5461 firmware from <a href="http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=5461">here</a>. Once you have the firmware, you can flash it through a DOS command using TFTP, i.e. <strong>tftp -i &lt;IP Address of your USR-5461&gt; -put &lt;firmware file name&gt;</strong>. Your computer must be connected to one of the LAN ports of your USR-5461 unit.</p>									</div>

					<p>This depends on the model. Linksys WRT54G routers for example must also be flashed with a non-trx format when using tftp.<br />I think tftping the .usr file will work too.</p>									</div>

					<p>No. It didn&#039;t work. I thnk, the best solution would be flashing it with an Original firmware, but in trx format.<br />I wonder if someone managed to convert an usr file in an trx.</p>									</div>

					<p>This worked for me.&nbsp; I just tftp&#039;d the 5461.usr firmware (following directions to load the firmware from the OpenWRT website), waited a minute or two, reboot, and it was restored without a problem.</p>									</div>
