					<p>A question commonly asked by Verizon FiOS users is &quot;can I use my own router?&quot;&nbsp; For the most part the answer is yes, but certain features (on-screen caller ID and remote DVR access) require that the Verizon-branded router be configured with your public IP address.&nbsp; If you want to use your own router and still keep all features, that generally means running your router secondary... which makes your LAN &quot;double NAT&#039;ed&quot;.</p><p>One way to run your own router &quot;primary&quot; and still keep Caller ID and Remote DVR is the elaborate &quot;three router&quot; setup described here: <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16710">http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16710</a>&nbsp; The key to that setup is to insert a third router -- between your router and the Verizon-branded router -- as a NAT so they can both share the same public IP.</p><p>Now I think that&#039;s silly and a waste of electricity, so I instead came up with a way with OpenWRT (using Linux Network Namespaces and the Virtual Ethernet driver), to accomplish the same thing without the third router.</p><p>My scripts are up on github: <a href="https://github.com/Voltara/openwrt-fakewan">https://github.com/Voltara/openwrt-fakewan</a></p><p>They consist of an init.d script that sets up the namespaced interfaces, and a udhcpc.user script that reconfigures the namespaced network (IP addresses, SNAT&#039;s, dnsmasq) whenever the public IP changes.&nbsp; It can also cycle disable/enable a switch port to force the secondary device to renew DHCP (the switch port needs to be on a separate SNMP managed switch; OpenWRT&#039;s &quot;swconfig&quot; currently does not expose the &quot;enable_port&quot; function in the driver.)</p><p>The big downside of this is you need your own custom build of OpenWRT because the stock build does not enable CONFIG_KERNEL_NET_NS.&nbsp; (And I&#039;m not sure what the proper way is to ask for it.)</p><p>But the code is out there if you want to play with it!</p>									</div>
