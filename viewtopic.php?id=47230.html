					<p>I have seen a paper says that &quot;Atheros hardware allows the creation of different types of hardware queues, one of which is a beacon queue. A beacon queue is initialized with a beacon interval (bintval)value that specifies the duration at which a periodic hardware interrupt (HAL_INT_SWBA) is generated. The default handler for this interrupt invokes a beacon generating function in the MadWiFi driver code.&quot;<br />Now,I want to override or modify the madwifi&#039;s default interrupt handler to handle the HAL_INT_SWBA interrupt(which is generated after a beacon has been generated,i think).Who can help me that where should i do with in the OpenWRT,thx.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MyAngelLYC</strong> on 8 Nov 2013, 09:23)</p>
