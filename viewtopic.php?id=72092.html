					<p>I have to preface this by saying that I have not yet installed openwrt on my router, I&#039;m just wondering if it has the functionality I&#039;m looking for.</p><p>I set up my WR1043ND router to act as a WDS bridge between my local Ethernet network and a wifi network (public network, but with portal login) I have access to. My problem is that the connection is cut every day, approximately. I have tracked down the issue to the wifi network&#039;s channel, which seems to change regularly (there are multiple antennas in the network). Changing the channel manually in the router&#039;s web interface, to match the wifi network fixes the issue.</p><p>The default TP Link firmware doesn&#039;t seem to be able to match the wifi network&#039;s channel automatically, when it changes. I would like to know if openwrt can do that, before flashing my router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JMuller</strong> on 17 Sep 2017, 22:00)</p>

					<p>Hi JMuller, in theory OpenWrt / LEDE should be able to do it.

					<p>When you set up a STA (client) interface or a STA-WDS, the default is to search through channels until an AP with matching SSID is found.&nbsp; Optionally the BSSID (AP&#039;s MAC address) can be specified if there are multiple AP&#039;s with the same SSID and you want to always connect to a specific one.&nbsp; If the connection is lost, the search resumes and automatically re-connects, possibly on a different channel.&nbsp; So this should work for your application.&nbsp; </p><p>If you have a local AP on the same radio, it will go off the air until the STA is acquired.&nbsp; Then it will resume operation on the new channel.&nbsp; Since there is only one hardware RF section, all signals to or from the same radio have to be on the same channel.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the advice. I&#039;ve flashed my router with LEDE (openwrt doesn&#039;t support v4 of the WR-1043ND). It works perfectly. I can even use 192.168.0.0/16 addresses in my LAN now, instead of using the same IP subnet as the wifi network.<br />Love it. It&#039;s been difficult to figure it out, but definitely worth it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>
