					<p>Hi everyone here! I have somewhat different question: have anyone succeeded with streaming video from a webcam with this router? According to specs, it has USB 2.0 on the board, but any applications I&#039;ve tested couldn&#039;t start because of the usb brandwidth (or something else). I&#039;ve tested mjpg_stream, motion etc. Is there any other router capable for video streaming?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>imperfect</strong> on 10 Feb 2012, 18:47)</p>

					<p>Using jffs is dangerous.<br />If you uninstall any important modules, and if you mis-config your router, you will not able to recover unless using serial interface.<br />It is just a little router, it is not capable to install so many services to turn it as a multifunction server....</p>									</div>

					<p>So lets see if I understand this, before I had installed a trunk from a few days ago, and when I tried to do install the 3g packages with opkg they required a more up to date kernel than the one I had, is that right?<br />I updated to the latest sysupgrade image and started from scratch and I think I managed to do it. I will start plugging the usb modem now and try to configure the connection.<br />If I have just installed the required kernel package into the old image it would have been the same?</p><p>I already have some of the packages required for 3g installed, so I didnt reinstall them. Shouldnt this keep more free space available in the device? I checked them and they see to be the same as the ones listed in opkg.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thorazine74</strong> on 14 Feb 2012, 12:25)</p>
