					<p>Hello,</p><p>I want to set up OpenWRT on my Asus router but I still cannot understand how to start. I expect to have pre-compiled image for my hardware but it seems there is no such thing on Downloads section. Can somebody help me how to install the latest kernel (2.6?). If I correctly understand I have to compile the kernel but I am not sure what cross-compiler is necessary, libs, etc.? For example I have Ubuntu what I have to install to compile? (Or maybe it can be compiled under Windows <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>You don&#039;t need to compile anything. Just use <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm-2.4/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … uashfs.trx</a></p><br /><p>This is with kernel 2.4.<br />If you want kernel 2.6, you should compile yourself since the current Kamikaze 8.09 kernel 2.6 image doesn&#039;t work well with broadcom wifi. It&#039;s because broadcom didn&#039;t release specs or an open source driver. Kernel 2.4 use a proprietarty, binary driver for wireless.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the link - I will try it tomorrow.<br />I don&#039;t remember but kernel 2.4 had some problem - maybe with port forwarding or something similar but it was important for me.<br />Is there a chance to be realized kernel 2.6 binary image soon?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I compiled kernel 2.6 with the instructions of this page:</p><p><a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Hardware(2f)Asus(2f)WL500GPV2.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs( … 0GPV2.html</a></p><p>but there is a step to patch 2 files located in .../linux-2.6.25.16/... folder and my package has /linux-2.6.28.10/ at the same position. Does this mean that I do not need these patches + recompilation?</p><p>Also one additional question - can I load the Openwrt firmware using the GUI menu for firmware upgrade (in the standart router software) or it is necessary to use TFTP?</p>									</div>

					<p>I compiled it and OpenWRT is working - the trx file was only 1.8MB - does this mean that I have not included all necessary modules or they can be installed later with update? And one stupid question - how to change the IP address from 192.168.1.1? There is some nvram command but it did not help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>T1000</strong> on 7 May 2009, 22:38)</p>

Whether you compile yourself or not, you <strong>still</strong> going to have problems with Wi-Fi. So, if you are OK without WiFi, you don&#039;t have to compile 2.6 either, but rather you can take precompiled version from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm47xx/openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx">here</a>. Actually, if you are new to OpenWrt (and even if you are not), you may want to consider the version with Webif at x-wrt.org</p><p>There are many discussions about what to do if you want both kernel 2.6 <strong>and</strong> WiFi - but recompiling yourself does not solve it!</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ymhee_bcex</strong> on 7 May 2009, 23:11)</p>
