					<p>Hello,</p><p>I installed the trunk/latest on my D-Link DIR-300A, but it is too unstable, the ssh terminal becomes <br />sometimes laggy, and the device reboots after a while. So I decided to revert to an earlier<br />stable version, but don&#039;t know, how to begin with it, as I am afraid that such a reboot may<br />happen in the middle of the flashing in the &#039;normal&#039; mode. I guess I should use the failsafe<br />mode, but there are contradicting documentations about how to get into failsafe on a DIR-300A.</p><p>Pls. clarify, <br />a) whether the failsafe mode is safe enough for a firmware change ?<br />b) if it isn&#039;t, what is the procedure in such a case ?<br />c) how to get into failsafe on this device</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zrx8</strong> on 12 Jun 2014, 13:51)</p>

					<p>First I had dd-wrt. Then I reflashed the factory fw, it went like a breeze.<br />Then tried out openwrt (as described here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300</a> ), <br />and now there is simply no way entering the bootloader (all the instructions about how <br />to enter the bootloader refer to the dd-wrt documentation, which somehow doesn&#039;t work in openwrt)<br />When the boot is complete, I can telnet in it, but after some network activity, eg. ftp&#039;ing the<br />flash image, it runs out of memory, and reboots.<br />I don&#039;t know what &quot;doctoring the bootloader&quot; means, sorry.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zrx8</strong> on 12 Jun 2014, 23:41)</p>

					<p>He is asking if you have modified the bootloader in any way. If not then Openwrt should make no difference, the procedure is the same because it happens before either DD-WRT or OpenWrt loads.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK guys, thank you for the advices, I listed out the redboot config with fconfig, and it turned out, that for some reason the bootp_my_ip was set to 192.168.1.10 instead of ...1, that was the problem. Now I can go further.</p>									</div>
