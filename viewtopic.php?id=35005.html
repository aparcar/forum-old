					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>perhaps someone is able to tell me where is my fault in running ntpd on my Buffalo Airstation (r29614) as an ntp-Server just for my intranet (=LAN)?</p><p>I need a second ntpd in my local network as my former ntp-server at the moment is not running permanently, so according to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ntp.client">this HowTo</a>, I&#039;ve added &quot;-l&quot; in line 23 and restarted the Airstation.<br /># cat sysntpd<br />[...]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; local args=&quot;-n -l&quot;</p><p>netstat -a is telling me that it is running as a daemon (I guess so):<br /># netstat -a<br />udp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 0.0.0.0:ntp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0.0.0:*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p># ps aux | grep ntpd<br /> 2284 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1480 S&nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/sbin/ntpd -n -l -p 0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org -p 1.</p><p>But it seems that I cannot connect to it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />All my clients (running on Debian Lenny and Squeeze with chrony) are telling me (from the clients /var/log/syslog):<br />Feb 26 00:15:37 client2 chronyd[10929]: No intersecting endpoints found</p><p>The second problem: none of the clients is able to get a timeserver from outside my local network.
