					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m currently using OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1-rc5 on a Linksys WRT54GS.</p><br /><p>I&#039;m using OpenDNS services, so to do this I have configured the wan interface with the DNS dedicated entries : 208.67.222.222 &amp; 208.67.220.220<br />I&#039;m also using local fix resolution for: NAS, servers, ...</p><p>My need is to have for all my computers the local DNS known as my router (that is the default configuration indeed), and to have for any DNS request a prior search on the local DNS entries first then, if no entry found, to follow on OpenDNS search.</p><p>The actual behavior is that all DNS requests are send to OpenDNS first.</p><p>A look on the resolv.conf.auto file gives:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# cat /tmp/resolv.conf.auto 
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
nameserver 10.1.1.1</code></pre></div><p>10.1.1.1 is my router IP adress<br />I suppose it should be better to have the entry &quot;nameserver 10.1.1.1&quot; on the first line</p><p>So my question is : Is there a way to do this or shoud your think it must be raised as an issue ?</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>There is an easy way around this. Take a look at the dnsmasq wiki page.</p><p>Effectively you&#039;ll want to configure Dnsmasq with static upstream nameservers (OpenDNS in your case). Then you either:</p><p>1) Set your static local entries directly in dnsmasq&#039;s config; or<br />2) Tell dnsmasq to send all queries for *.local (for example) to a specific nameserver</p><p>Ultimately your resolv.conf will point at 127.0.0.1 (dnsmasq), and then dnsmasq will handle the switching logic for you.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>Many thanks samcrawford for your quick reply.</p><p>unfortunately, I need to add some information to this post.</p><p>After a restart of the wan interface erything in coming ok again.</p><p>Here are the resolv files: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc# cat /tmp/resolv.conf.auto 
nameserver 10.1.1.1
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
root@OpenWrt:/etc# cat /tmp/resolv.conf      
search lan
nameserver 127.0.0.1

search lan
nameserver 127.0.0.1</code></pre></div><p>Additionally, I know it&#039;s possible to tune many things directly in config files, but I choose to only use GUI interface that must be useful l enough&nbsp; for anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>So I just would like to advise that something goes wrong sometime, maybe at startup.<br />It could be interesting to know if anyone witness the same behavior.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Hrm, you took the first line before the WAN restart and the second one afterwards? If so, that makes some sense and your latter config looks sensible.</p><p>If the problem recurs, post your /etc/config/network and /etc/config/dhcp files.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>The router is behind my provider&#039;s box.<br />The wan network address is 192.168.1.0/24 and on the lan side I set it up to 10.1.1.0/24</p><p>I witness sometimes, after a reboot, it was impossible to route traffic to the wan. At the same time on the global status on the GUI I observed the address 10.1.1.0/24 for the wan ! or sometimes it was a DNS problem only as I discussed before. After rebooting the wan interface it comes back to the right configuration that is 192.168.1.0/24.</p><p>If I remember it was after a power on...</p><p>It seems processes are maybe not starting in the right order with my configuration, it&#039;s only an assumption !</p><p>I will make some test in the next few days. Of course if I see something again around this, I will give you as many information as possible, starting of course with configuration files.</p><p>Many thanks</p><p>Kris</p>									</div>
