					<p>Hi --</p><p>I&#039;ve got White Russian RC3-<br />doing the following-</p><p>I have a PIX 501 firewall, so I only use the WRT as an AP and a DHCP server<br />(at least, that&#039;s the plan- Since WRT supports static reservations and the PIX does not, the WRT is my choice for hardware-based reboots-and-works every time DHCP server..</p><p>I have configured DHCP to hand out my internal LAN addresses (192.168.37.200,192.168.37.250), with a router option of the PIX (192.168.37.1) </p><p>What I&#039;d like to do is somehow obtain my ISP&#039;s DNS servers, which seem to change constantly, and pass those out with DHCP-<br />But I&#039;m not using _any_ of the ports on the WRT in any sort of dynamic mode-- the WAN port is off, since this is _really_ just a <br />hardware DHCP server and AP for me.. I don&#039;t use it for routing at all.</p><p>Anyone got any idea of how to pass dynamic DNS servers? Or a good known set of DNS servers that don&#039;t move around?</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>
