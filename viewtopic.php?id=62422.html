					<p>I accidentally overwrote the ART partition on this router and now not even the TFTP debricking method is working because of it. I&#039;m ready to reflash using JTAG, but the ART partition isn&#039;t included in the stock firmware image you can download from dlink. So, I&#039;ll need this partition from an already-working router.</p><p>From <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43515&amp;p=3">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 15&amp;p=3</a> :<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>teslamint wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>ewtoombs wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>teslamint wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Looks like your router&#039;s ART partition is broken.</p></blockquote></div><p>Any ideas on how to fix it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Get dump file of ART partition from someone&#039;s DIR-615 router, edit the MAC address with hex editor, and write to flash.</p></blockquote></div><p>So, this is me asking everybody on this forum with a working dir-615-i1 if you could dump its flash memory to a file for me so I can recover the ART partition? I have a JTAG adapter and I&#039;m ready to start repairing this thing&#039;s ART partition. Could you also post your router&#039;s MAC address so I can figure out where the MAC address is stored in the ART partition?</p>									</div>
