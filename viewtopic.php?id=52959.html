					<p>Looking at the various recipes that have been posted for OpenVPN I&#039;m pretty confident that I could get an OpenVPN client running on OpenWRT and make it the default gateway so that all traffic goes out over it.</p><p>However, I&#039;d still like to forward connections coming in over the WAN interface to a host on my LAN.&nbsp; </p><p>I suspect that if I don&#039;t set things up correctly that is going to result in reply packets from the LAN host going out over the VPN interface and not over the WAN interface, since that is the default route.</p><p>What is the best way to accomplish this on OpenWRT?&nbsp; Would it be best to install one of the multi-wan modules (I found a forum post that suggests that mwan2 handles this automatically, but it wasn&#039;t in the context of OpenVPN - I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;ll work together especially since the VPN interface won&#039;t exist at boot)?&nbsp; I also found a recipe for marking incoming connections which might work to send the replies out the right interface, though that recipe didn&#039;t mention how to make the configuration persistent (I&#039;m new to OpenWRT) - it just had iptables command lines which I imagine would get lost on poweroff and which would need to be run after the VPN interface is created.</p><p>I have to imagine that I&#039;m not the only person who wants to use a VPN service but allow for port forwarding on the WAN interface, so I figured somebody might have a recipe they&#039;d be willing to share...</p><p>BTW - I&#039;ve been running OpenWRT for all of a few hours but i&#039;m VERY impressed with it.&nbsp; It was a breeze to install on my Buffalo router.</p>									</div>
