					<p>Hello friends,</p><p>I&#039;m new to this forum and looking for some open source firmware for the Huawei HG556A or TP Link WR841N router.</p><p>The firmware should enable to create a WiFi hotspot and allow login through facebook, twitter, Google+, Linkedin, Foursquare and Instagram.</p><p>Are there any existing open source firmware for such services? Can we set up our own server on cloud such as Amazon AWS for offering the hotspot?</p><p>If there isn&#039;t any opensource firmware, can some one code the firmware for us for HG556A router?</p><p>We are also looking to create a firmware for Hame A16 mobile portable router in future.</p><p>Please contact us on sales@optitrans.co.in if you are interested in developing a firmware for us.</p>									</div>
