					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I am trying to setup an IPSec VPN using ipsec-tools. When a new client connects to the VPN, all the routing between the VPN and LAN is performed via SA policies, but there are no routes or interfaces setup. In my case my LAN is 192.168.0.0/0 and the VPN is 192.68.1.0/0.</p><p>The VPN seems to be working correctly in one direction, the clients in can connect to hosts in the LAN. But in the opposite direction, it seems that when a host in the LAN tries to communicate with a VPN client, once the traffic reaches the router, it is routed via the WAN port instead of sending it via the VPN tunnel.</p><p>My guess is that it has to do with the OpenWRT firewall and masq options. Currently as it is, the VPN considers the VPN subnet to be part of the WAN zone.</p><p>I am wondering if there is a way to specify a new zone in the OpenWRT without an interface, but with a range of hosts?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to fix this it by using by restricting to masquerading to a negated subnet.</p><p>I still think the firewall interface could be more robust if zones could be specified in terms of hosts, ranges or interfaces. If there is a way to do it, I would appreciate it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I imagine you could do this with straight iptables rules (in /etc/firewall.user or such).</p>									</div>
