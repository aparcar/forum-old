					<p>I had this grandpa (WRT54GLv1.1) for ages and just changed it (Dec 11, 2016) for WRT1900ACSv2. My decision was based on my past experience with LInksys. Though Linksys has been bought from Cisco by Belkin international, I will still recommend using their products over any other due to reliability and long term durability. You can rarely brick them except done deliberate.</p><p>I am currently running dd-wrt and openwrt on my new WRT19900ACSv2 because it is dual boot. I completely replaced the original firmware with dd-wrt as second firmware choice for power and ease of booting process. The configuration is very easy. If you ever buy this hardware and need help, you can contact me through the forum. Alternatively, read the Wiki pages and ask questions in the various forums.</p>									</div>
