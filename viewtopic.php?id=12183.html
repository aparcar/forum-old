					<p>Hi Guys, I am attempting to install two OpenWRT boxes each with its own internet connection.&nbsp; The plan is to reduce the amount of single point failures that can occur.&nbsp; One of my issues which can bring my network down, is if the main OpenWRT box died, and the dchp and dns services became unavailable.&nbsp; So my question is, is there any DHCP server that is already packaged for OpenWRT that can support dhcp failover?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>William</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Weedy, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I apologize if my question was a bit unclear, but my question is actually related more to having a dhcp server that can support the following directive: failover peer</p><br /><p>An example of the usage of the directive would be as follows... Primary DHCP Server:<br />authoritative;<br />ddns-update-style none;</p><p>failover peer &quot;dhcp-failover&quot; {<br />&nbsp; primary; # declare this to be the primary server<br />&nbsp; address 192.168.200.2;<br />&nbsp; port 520;<br />&nbsp; peer address 192.168.200.3;<br />&nbsp; peer port 520;<br />&nbsp; max-response-delay 30;<br />&nbsp; max-unacked-updates 10;<br />&nbsp; load balance max seconds 3;<br />&nbsp; mclt 1800;<br />&nbsp; split 128;<br />}</p><p>subnet 192.168.200.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {<br />&nbsp; option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;<br />&nbsp; option broadcast-address 192.168.200.255;<br />&nbsp; option routers 192.168.200.1;<br />&nbsp; option domain-name-servers 192.168.200.1;<br />&nbsp; pool {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; failover peer &quot;dhcp-failover&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; max-lease-time 1800; # 30 minutes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; range 192.168.200.100 192.168.200.254;<br />&nbsp; }<br />}</p><br /><p>Secondary DHCP Server:<br />authoritative;<br />ddns-update-style none;</p><p>failover peer &quot;dhcp-failover&quot; {<br />&nbsp; secondary; # declare this to be the secondary server<br />&nbsp; address 192.168.200.3;<br />&nbsp; port 520;<br />&nbsp; peer address 192.168.200.2;<br />&nbsp; peer port 520;<br />&nbsp; max-response-delay 30;<br />&nbsp; max-unacked-updates 10;<br />&nbsp; load balance max seconds 3;<br />}</p><p>subnet 192.168.200.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {<br />&nbsp; option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;<br />&nbsp; option broadcast-address 192.168.200.255;<br />&nbsp; option routers 192.168.200.1;<br />&nbsp; option domain-name-servers 192.168.200.1;<br />&nbsp; pool {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; failover peer &quot;dhcp-failover&quot;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; max-lease-time 1800; # 30 minutes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; range 192.168.200.100 192.168.200.254;<br />&nbsp; }<br />}</p><p>The idea would be that my workstations/servers would get a dhcp ip from OpenWRT #1, and OpenWRT #1 would update the lease file on OpenWRT #2, so both lease files are identical.&nbsp; If OpenWRT #1 where to die, OpenWRT #2 would become the DHCP Authoritive server, and start handing out dhcp leases until OpenWRT #1 was back online.</p>									</div>
