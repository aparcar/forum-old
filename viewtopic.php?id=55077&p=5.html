					<p>Hi, I downloaded from main page from gdrive, i.e. &quot;openwrt-ramips-mt7620n-mlwg2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot;, I put it on usb and installed via telnet both KernelA-B as written in the txt file. It boot once I was able to change settings inside LUCI (static IP 192.168.201.254 for LAN and WIFI). After I was in the same stage as blackysky. Only Internet led blue and battery green and the leds is almost on without flashing after I press power button (seems openwrt is not booting at all). Before flashing the openwrt I did original firmware upgrade maybe two times. Now wifi is off and I can not connect to the lan port. Could you please help me, what to do?. thx</p>									</div>

					<p>For all guys who got problems after flashing openwrt over updated original firmware.<br />In first of all, sorry for my poor english <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />&nbsp; If you have installed openwrt after updating original firmware, you probably woudn&#039;t be able to get an access to your router via ethernet or wifi, because it&#039;s not starting properly anymore. But you can fix it, because you still have a well working bootloader and probably working openwrt firmware.</p><p>&nbsp; I just have debricked my MLWG2 after the same actions and the same problem. The point is only in changing one of the bootloader variables - &quot;bootstate&quot; from 2 to 0. Here is common instructions:</p><p>1) Get USB-TTL 3.3V serial cable or adapter, solder RxD, TxD and GND to contacts on MLWG2. On the main MLWG2 page of openwrt wiki you can find photos and description. Also read wiki about serial cables: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial.cables.">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/p … al.cables.</a> I&#039;ve used old Sony-Ericsson phone cable with converter.<br />2) Get PuTTy.exe, it&#039;s a serial terminal program. Set connection parameters to: speed - 57600, serial line - COM(your number of USB-TTL COM port, look in device manager). Open the connection.<br />3) Turn on MLWG2. If you have no messages, switch RxD and TxD. You must get some service information from bootloader, later this prompt and short 1-sec delay:</p><p>Please choose the operation:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1: Load system code to SDRAM via TFTP.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3: Boot system code via Flash (default).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4: Entr boot command line interface.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;7: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via Serial.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;9: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via TFTP.</p><p>you shoud press 4. By the fact, you can press 4 in the time you&#039;ll see something on the screen. If you missed the moment, turn off\on and do it again.<br />4) In a case of success, you&#039;ll get this commandline prompt:</p><p>You choosed 4</p><p>raspi_read: from:40028 len:6</p><p>4: System Enter Boot Command Line Interface.</p><p>U-Boot 1.1.3 (Dec 30 2013 - 10:32:24)<br />MT7620 #</p><p>5) Here you can change bootstate=2 to 0. Type this:</p><p>setenv bootstate=0<br />saveenv</p><br /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This commands means: setenv variable_name=x - &quot;set variable to&quot; , bootstate - variable that controls bootloading from first or second half of a memory(if I have understand it correctly), saveenv - &quot;saving all the variables to memory&quot;.</p><p>This is all, should work. Type &quot;reset&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;P.S. After all, I found a post of HLK, who wrote basically the same but not so clear for me on the moment of bricking my MLWG2, so I lost this post between other posts (his instructions weren&#039;t detailed).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;P.P.S. If you don&#039;t have a USB-TTL 3.3v cable, according openwrt wiki in most cases you can use any other router with openwrt installed (directly openwrt router -&gt; MLWG2, without PC).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cdqube</strong> on 5 Jan 2016, 10:25)</p>

					<p>Can anyone please tell me how to mount the SD card? I installed some packages related to gpio and mmc. After rebooting I tried to mount /dev/sda1 under /mnt/sda1(which I created earlier). It didn&#039;t work. Should I try out the steps mentioned in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mmc_over_gpio">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mmc_over_gpio</a> ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have just received a new MLGW2.&nbsp; I plan to flash it directly to OpenWrt.&nbsp; </p><p>It appears there is some missing information on GPIOs, leds, button and switches.&nbsp; Once I telnet to the device, and before loading OpenWrt, is there any information I can query that will help identify this information?</p>									</div>

I don&#039;t remember exactly the message, but the point was &quot;wrong version of the packet&quot; or something like that. I&#039;ve found somewhere here that Barrier Breaker doesn&#039;t support NTFS, so that was the reason. For now I don&#039;t neet a help, it&#039;s not a question but an answer: if you want NTFS support, install Chaos Calmer... I haven&#039;t tried to use samba + ntfs on Chaos Calmer yet, but at least there&#039;s no messages about compability issues during installation of the ntfs drivers.</p>									</div>

					<p>@electroman - Is this what you are referring to in post 107?&nbsp; (GPIO40)<br />Way out of my skill set, but is this the power button?<br />Ideally looking to configure an action for a long press (10-15 seconds) <br />The manual for the factory firmware kind of indicates that this comes configured with a short and long press (Page 4, item F)</p>									</div>
