					<p>Hi!</p><p>I got stuck while trying to configure IPsec VPN via ipsec-tools on my RouterBoard 532A. I&#039;ve tried to install ipsec-tools, kmod-ipsec, kmod-ipsec4, kmod-ipsec6 and kmod-crypto via ipkg, but as soon as I try to start racoon or configure policies with setkey tool I get following error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Foreground mode.
2000-01-01 00:03:44: INFO: @(#)ipsec-tools 0.6.6 (http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net)
2000-01-01 00:03:44: INFO: @(#)This product linked OpenSSL 0.9.8e 23 Feb 2007 (http://www.openssl.org/)
2000-01-01 00:03:44: ERROR: libipsec failed pfkey open (Address family not supported by protocol)
racoon: something error happened while pfkey initializing.</code></pre></div><p>I get same error even if I manually load modules ah4 and esp4. I just can&#039;t get it work! Does anyone have any idea, what could be wrong? (I suppose, that I have missed some package, that is needed by ipsec, but I really haven&#039;t got any idea which one.)</p><p>Thanks a lot for any response!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Marek</p>									</div>
