					<p>The easiest way is to flux the whole resistor, then blob solder over the whole thing.

					<p>GPIOs 0 6 7 14 15 29 can all be floating (ie resistors removed) without affecting boot on wr703n. I have verified this and edited the WiKi.<br />I have also added an antenna connector as well as patched into GND, 3v3 and 5v.<br />As soon as I get a chance I will upload some picks, but due to the flimsy nature of some of the pads I had to hot glue over the solder points in some cases.<br />Next Job, find a use for this beast <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
