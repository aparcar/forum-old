					<p>Neither one of those is ready to go with OpenWrt.&nbsp; The 6220 being MediaTek should be supportable, but there don&#039;t seem to be any builds for it.&nbsp; I think the Asus is Broadcom based, so avoid it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would suggest that you perform some speed tests over ethernet ports after your service is in place.&nbsp; Given your inclination to re-flash the router, likely voiding the warranty, I would look at the cheapest, supported router I could find.</p><p>In my instance, my speed tests rarely go above 322mbps.&nbsp; I was able to get an TEW-732BR directly from TrendNet for $11USD +shipping.&nbsp; It supports 300mbps and flashed easily.&nbsp; I liked the form factor of the TEW-732, upright, small footprint with the cables entering at table top height for stability.&nbsp; I saw other, newer and faster routers on their site.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 3 Mar 2017, 20:58)</p>

I found that the asus 1400GU is using a MTK CPU like the netgear: <br /><a href="http://ht%20tps://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_RT-AC1200GU">ht tps://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_RT-AC1200GU</a> (remove the space between t and t)</p><p>At the moment I&#039;m stucked with gearbest so I got nowhere to go.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zanetdan94</strong> on 3 Mar 2017, 20:16)</p>
