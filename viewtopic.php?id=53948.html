					<p>Hello all, </p><p>Just wanted to say thank you for having me to your forums. I recently just purchased this router and still have the stock firmware on it, which updated itself to 1.1.8. I am using a 3rd party VDSL2 provider in Canada. Since its 3rd party the only VDSL modems we have access to are the SmartRG 505N VDSL2 gateways. It is our only option. I am currently on a 50/10 VDSL connection that when I am hardwired into the modem in routed pppoe mode or hardwired into the Linksys router via modem in bridged mode I am able to achieve the full 50/10 speeds in speedtests in downloads. However, when it comes to wireless I am having an issue. This both affects the modem in routed mode and the router (which I purchased because I believed it would solve the problem).</p><p>I apologize for the rather long post but I am going to try and explain everything to all, and maybe someone can point me in the right direction.</p><p>Both devices whither it be the modem in routed or in bridged with router give me a 50% speed loss in connection no matter where in the house (only on the downstream) the upstream remains the same, even on wireless it never changes.</p><p>Hardwired consistent speed tests of 49~50mbps/7.66mbps - multiple sites and computers.</p><p>Wireless speed tests of 18~20mbps/7.66mbps. - multiples sites and computers.</p><p>Regardless of location I am losing about 30mbps over the wireless connections. I have tested this on 2 machines so far, both in different locations of the house. The only thing ISP could recommend for me to do was to manually scan channels and look for interference.</p><p>Thing is, I upgraded from a 15/1 connection (which when I was connected I was on a 19M/888 profile) (888) because of the Stinger remote issue. I was using a TP-Link 8841 ADSL2+ modem and WRT54GL router. Hardwired the connection would always result in speedtests of 16mbps/.72mbps. Wireless would be around like 13~14mbps/.72 .... not much of a loss. Only 3 megs or so on the wireless which I was really happy. Unless I dipped into the basement then it would drop to around 7~8 which I really did still think was fantastic considering a 15M ADSL2 connection.</p><p>Now, I&#039;m running totally new hardware with a VDSL2 connection and these 2 wireless devices are giving a 30mbps loss in wireless. Has anyone run into a similar problem or can anyone recommend me any troubleshooting tips?</p><p>I will try another wireless N machine tomorrow and give it a go, getting tired playing around all night. I tried rolling through all the channels manually and no go, same results. I even tried disabling the security wi-fi to see if that could be the problem, same results.</p><p>You&#039;ll laugh at this one. I tried the WRT54GL to see if maybe it was a router thing, and the WRT54GL was only able to get up to about ~15mbps on the wireless, while the SmartRG (in routed mode) was only about to get about ~22mbps same with the WRT1900AC with SmartRG in bridged mode.</p><p>Funny thing is the WRT54GL matched the upload had no problems there at 7.66mbps on speedtests and for latency didn&#039;t do that bad either. While SmartRG did 6-7ms as the WRT1900AC does same 6-8ms on latency the GL was up to 12ms ... so it added about 5-6 ms of latency which is not bad for an old router.</p><p>Still I couldn&#039;t believe it was pulling 14mbps, thats what it was doing on my wireless connection when I had the 15/1 plan. I didn&#039;t have any problems.</p><p>I&#039;m starting to wonder, can this be a problem with the SmartRG modem itself or the fact that I&#039;m connected to a Stinger remote and there is like some off modem setting? I wish I had another VDSL2 modem to test.</p><p>I would figure I would get at least 30~40mbps on a wifi network on a 50/10 connection. But 18~20 is a bit ridiculous. I might as well downgrade to the 25/10 plan and I&#039;d probably still get 14-15 meg on the wifi around the house, this time with no dead zones I assume with the AC routers range.</p><p>Was also checking out this post here and wondering if it could be possibly related on the ISP side as well? </p><p><a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r28669599-Speed-PSA-Slow-WiFi-on-Comcast-May-be-Comcasts-Fault">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r286695 â€¦ asts-Fault</a></p><p>Apologies for the extremely long post, and I know if I am getting 50/10 on a hardwire connection its not really an &#039;issue&#039; as the speeds are OK. But it seems strange to me that a almost commercial grade router @ $279 retail cannot do a better wi-fi speedburst then the SmartRG modem in routed mode? It&#039;s results are the same as the modems wifi results and a lot of users complain its not that great of a device in routed mode.</p><p>I mean since I tested 2 routers and the modem itself, was wondering if you guys had any suggestions.</p><p>Sure, I don&#039;t mind hardwiring a machine to get 50/10 out of it, but the rest of the users if they are getting less then 20mbps ...... it kind of defeats the purpose in upgrading in a sense that, the bill is almost doubled in price for an increase of 5mbps in wireless service. I might as well go back down .... </p><p>Thank you for your time.</p><p>That&#039;s a pretty low speed-test for a 50/10 connection on a wireless AC router 15 ft away. Its a joke really. It&#039;s only 5mbps more then when I had ADSL2 15/1 connection. Though the ping is amazing.</p><p> <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3902835283"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/3902835283.png" alt="http://www.speedtest.net/result/3902835283.png" /></span></a></p><p>Thank you everyone so much for your time.</p>									</div>
