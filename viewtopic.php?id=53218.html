					<p>hi everyone! i&#039;ge got the idea to use router not only to deliver internet to my home devices, but to make all them able to play sound via my home hi-fi using an usb audio card, plugged into the usb port of the router. all i know about it is that it&#039;s possible at all, and that i would need to upgrade the firmware of the router, because no router is able to do it &quot;right out of the box&quot;.<br />has anyone got to do it? what soundcard do i need for this, and which model of router? (i still havent got any, just planning). can i make it with open-wrt, or maybe DD-wrt? i&#039;m just aware of them, but i had no router before, and no experience with smart routers...</p>									</div>

					<p>You can just use a &#039;generic usb sound device&#039;. If it is supplied with drivers, it&#039;s probably not generic enough.</p><p>If you want to stream audio streams, the box may just lack the juice to do so. Most codecs need floating point support, and most routers don&#039;t have that, so soft floats are used, which is not very fast.</p><p>For playing mp3 libmad is available, which is an mp3 decoder which doesn&#039;t use floats. But I don&#039;t know if such implementations are also available for other codecs.</p>									</div>
