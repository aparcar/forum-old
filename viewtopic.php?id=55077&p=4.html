Create the file /etc/hotplug.d/button/buttons with your favorite text editor, paste the following:

Verify if the issue is with your serial adapter by testing on another device. Double check the that you have it solder to the correct pins. I provided a picture above. Post some photos on your soldering and screenshot from you computer so we have a better idea.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>King0fK0ng</strong> on 21 Aug 2015, 21:05)</p>
