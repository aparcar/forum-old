					<p>Hi, guys!</p><p>When I login as a non-root user and try to run &quot;ping&quot;, it just says &quot;Permission denied&quot;. Then I learn to run the command &quot;chmod u+s /bin/busybox&quot; to make it work. </p><p>I read about it that this is the &quot;setuid&quot; that does the trick. In wikipedia it says &quot;When an executable file has been given the setuid attribute, normal users on the system who have permission to execute this file gain the privileges of the user who owns the file (commonly root) within the created process.&quot;</p><p>What puzzles me is that now that busybox gets root preveleges when running, &quot;touch&quot;, &quot;vi&quot; and many other built-in commands still don&#039;t work with root owned files. I also tried opkg, before +s it &quot;cannot creat lock file&quot;, and after +s it doesn&#039;t have privilege to open the downloaded file. Quite intresting.</p><p>I searched this for hours but it seems I&#039;m unable to find more useful information. So guys can you plese give me a clue on how this is happening?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>moderaterain</strong> on 5 Sep 2013, 12:45)</p>
