					<p>Okay guys,<br />so here is the deal. I am new to OpenWRT and tbh didnt manage to flash the sysupgrade onto my router. I tried the option 1, that Bazz mentioned earlier with his pre-made u-boot-env image but got a &quot;Unlocking u-boot-env ...Could not open mtd device: u-boot-env&quot; when performing &quot;mtd -f write uboot_env_bootcmd_nocrc.backup u-boot-env&quot;. Sadly, I have also not managed to find the bootcmd section through the hexeditor.</p><p>Id be thankful for any help, preferably maybe some kind of tutorial.</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you so much @bazz for your work on this! The WN2000RPTv3 utilizes similar hardware, just lacking a WAN port. I was able to flash to OpenWrt on this model by creating a custom Netgear build that automatically writes the modified u-boot-env part. I&#039;ve posted instructions and files here:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65576">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=65576</a></p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey guys, new here but alot of information here has helped me out. I own a WNR2000v4 which i recently had OpenWRT 15.05 successfully installed upon. The information provided on this forum and the wiki were amazingly helpful. </p><p>Mind you...my road has gone a bit awry.</p><p>Ofcourse, like anyone else i was dissatisfied with the memory available on the device and figured i&#039;d attempt my hands at a Luci-less installation with usb packages for a USB mod. Afterwards i would install luci in the expanded usb storage.</p><p>I installed the build environment and went through several configuration variations until i came up with something i was satisfied with testing.</p><p>I flashed the new sysupgrade.bin, everything went well. My router settings were saved as expected and my luci-less setup was running. My wireless came up as expected and my router functioned normally. The only caveat was that i could no longer SSH into my router. For some reason my root password had become changed/corrupted? After some intense googling i decided to tftp reset firmware back to 1.0.0.58 which went without a hitch. </p><p>I&#039;m currently sitting here with as stock a WNR2000v4 as i could possibly ask for, running perfectly fine mind you.</p><p>The plan was to start from stock and reinstall openwrt so i could set the root password as with an initial installation..</p><p>However, now i&#039;m stuck since UDPtelnetenable.py will not enable telnet on my device for some reason.</p><p>-- This totally worked the first time round.</p><p>So....what now? &gt;.&lt;</p><p>--EDIT <br />So i think i&#039;ll be getting a USB / TTL Serial cable, ya?</p><p>Well, i got the UDPtelnetenable.py to work, i dunno i got up this morning and tried it out again..bam it worked -shrugs- i dunno wtf i was doing wrong. Anyway...</p><p>On another note, i do own an Arduino Uno anyone done serial communication with it like the OWRT wiki says about @ <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gt99a8z">http://tinyurl.com/gt99a8z</a>?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fateinabox</strong> on 23 Jun 2016, 09:13)</p>

					<p>So i managed to get serial access using my Arduino Uno and a NPN Transistor and some 1k/10k ohm resistors as a llc.. setting the root passwd from here does nothing for SSH whatsoever. </p><p>I&#039;ve set the default passwd shadow files in build-root/openwrt/package/base-files/etc/ in my custom sysupgrade.bin and verified their contents through shell on serial.</p><p>Is this a jffs2 issue? </p><p>I couldn&#039;t manage to set the password from failsafe mode either.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i66.tinypic.com/ddi4qt.jpg" alt="http://i66.tinypic.com/ddi4qt.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Trying to get this wnr2000v4 flashed over to openwrt...first I couldn&#039;t get telnet enabled on stock 1.0.0.58 like it says on the wiki page.

					<p>I know it might seem silly but did you try running UDPtelnetenable.py via sudo?<br />if your router is 192.168.1.1 and the mac is 00:AA:22:BB:33:CC ( you can get your routers mac via `sudo arp -a` ) you would execute the following...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sudo python /path/to/UDPtelnetenable.py 192.168.1.1 00AA22BB33CC admin password</code></pre></div><br /><p>make note that there are no colons ( : ) and that the alpha characters are in caps ( this is necessary ) </p><p>additionally, where did you get your uboot_env_bootcmd_nocrc.backup ?? is it valid?? I can throw up a copy of my u-boot-env.bin file if you like.</p><p>can you post a copy of your stdout for review?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fateinabox</strong> on 25 Jun 2016, 02:29)</p>

					<p>On a side note, anyone got any tips on removing this EMI Shielding from the board? I don&#039;t have a heat-gun handy and the nature of the shield makes it an adequate heat sink, solder and solder wick doesn&#039;t really work too well. I thought about kinda &quot;reflowing&quot; the board and removing it once it was up to temperature. Not sure...I also thought about just cutting it off with a dremel...I dunno though.. seems a bit barbaric and riskeh.</p>									</div>
