					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>My subject might not be clear because I couldn&#039;t find a shorter way to express what I need. Please fully read my question before addressing some solutions.</p><p>Currently, I own a D-Link DSL2520U with standard firmware, a Philips SNA6500 with standard firmware and a TP-Link WA-701ND with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment (12.09 I think). DSL2520 is connected to ADSL2+ line, Philips SNA6500 is connected to its only ethernet port to serve as a switch and a wireless distributor (lets call it WLAN1). Then my WA-701ND is connected wirelessly to SNA6500 in order to distribute wireless signals further in my home, with a different ESSID (lets call it WLAN2)</p><p>The problem I am currently having is when I connect to WLAN2, I can connect to internet but I can&#039;t connect to devices WLAN1 or LAN. However, I can connect to these devices from WLAN1 or from DSL2520U&#039;s USB port. So I have narrowed the problem down to the Access Point containing OpenWrt firmware and that&#039;s why I am writing this thing here.</p><p>Similarly, I cannot access WA701ND&#039;s settings page from WLAN1.</p><p>What is the exact setting that I need to adjust so that I can connect to every device in my Local Network regardless the network I am connected? (Locally of course)</p><p>Things I have tried:<br />Setting a <strong>static route</strong> to 192.168.1.1 (address of DSL-2520U) inside OpenWRT<br />Setting all rules of firewall as &quot;ACCEPT&quot; regardless zones and also default rules.<br />Stopping the firewall service (WLAN2&#039;s internet connection was disabled after this so I re-enabled it)</p><p>PS: All this hassle is for not buying a better, powerful router. They are really expensive here in Turkey due to the currency. I hope that you guys can help a poor student to create up a better network in his house. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>murdertrk</strong> on 8 Jun 2016, 15:04)</p>

Unfortunately, when I disabled the DHCP, I immediately lost Internet connection at WLAN2. Re-enabling it did not help. Currently, my Wa701nd itself is connected to internet but devices connecting to wlan2 distributed by wa701nd does not have the internet connection. </p><p>By the way, I couldn&#039;t find the &#039;disable NAT&#039; option.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are some interesting things, so I am re-posting now. Instead of working on a fiddled around setup, I resetted settings using system/backup/flash firmware/perform reset and almost completely followed the steps from Dumb AP tutorial. Since I know that disabling firewall prevents my Internet connection, I skipped that part. </p><p>Then I connected to my primary wlan (wlan1) as a client and assigned the 701nd a static IP. Now when I set IPV4 settings of my computer to use 701nd as gateway, I can connect to internet. However, I cannot connect to 192.168.1.1 (settings page for my other modem).&nbsp; Since I fiddle a lot with the settings, I immediately took a backup. </p><p>So, I still need your help for merging those networks. I particularly want this for using homegroup function of Windows.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is always best to start with a diagram of what you are doing.

If this is possible, then you would have a &quot;flat&quot; network, and everything should be fine. If not, you have challenges, as you have already figured out.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>

This might solve my problem. Unfortunately, as I mentioned above, I now have a much bigger problem and prior to fixing that problem, solution to this &quot;merging networks&quot; is totally useless to me. I bricked my router in an (almost) unique way. You can read the details from the link above.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>murdertrk</strong> on 9 Jun 2016, 21:16)</p>

					<p>OOOOOO WOW i looked real good at what you had you have a AP with one lan you need to have a wan to do a OPKG&nbsp; <br />update to install relayD.You need relayd to make the client bridge work.I can build you a custom build of openwrt with relayd compiled in it i did this for other people and it worked great.I did this for a student in the UK she was very happy with the OPENWRT build i sent her.i think it was a TP-link TL730RE&nbsp; very bad stock firmware very unstable.Stock OPENWRT firmware you download from the site does not have relayd in it.</p>									</div>

By the way, since you mentioned a FT232 board, I can say that I own a similar board based on CH340G, which only lacks the proper level shifting circuitry. Despite this inadequency, TX to AP works like a charm. I have issues with RX from modem.
