					<p>&quot;make target/linux/update&quot; will work properly once you include the subdir in the quilt new command. The reason why it failed before is because your patch was neither in generic/ nor in platform/ so it was silently discarded.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello!</p><p>I would like to patch Openwrt and followed these instructions but it didn&#039;t work for my case. I have an existing kernel patch downloaded from the internet (trusted and valid source) and I would like to try and apply it on Openwrt. My problem begins on step 4 of the above mentioned procedure. How can I add an already existing patch (I do not want to edit it, neither write is on myself) to the platform patches of Openwrt? The existist patch has the name xyzw-descrioption.patch. I suppose I have to use quilt new platform/xyzw-descrioption.patch but I do not know how should I proceed.&nbsp; Any instructions would be useful. Thanks</p>									</div>
