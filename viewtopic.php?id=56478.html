					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;m setting up a new installation of OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r44972 / LuCI (git-15.079.29361-3e37216), and have hit a strange issue.</p><p>I did the initial configuration and setup via the SSH interface, and then installed LuCI.&nbsp; While still on the wired network, I installed privoxy and did some of the basic setup (wireless SSID, etc), then unplugged the ethernet cable and rebooted the router.</p><p>Now, from the wireless connection, when I log into the web interface, I am only able to log in and view the initial &#039;Status&#039; page.&nbsp; Any attempts to load any follow on pages (such as the configuration pages, firewall status, etc) results in LuCI kicking me back out to the login prompt (&quot;Authorization Required&quot;).&nbsp; I can log in again, but the same behavior persists, over and over again.&nbsp; On one occasion I was able to get into a secondary page (the wifi config page), but as soon as I went to another page I was back to the login prompt again.&nbsp; &nbsp; The router is up and running, seemingly fine... it&#039;s just that LuCI is effectively unusable.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><br /><p>Any thoughts on what might be going on here, or what I could do to start troubleshooting?&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked through all of the open tickets for LuCI, but didn&#039;t see any that matched this condition....</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the same problem and it was due to the cookies setting. I decided one day to reject all cookies disabling it in config of the browser. From that day the problem started. <br />Solution is to:<br />a) accept all cookies<br />b) add one by one the IP address (and ports) of the routers/sites you want.</p><p>I selected the second one. it is more boring to be adding one by one but it is really annoying all sites to be adding cookies and learning from you everything you do. By the way, the same &quot;forum.openwrt.org&quot;&nbsp; (https) has to be added to the list. </p><p>I hope that helps,</p><p>Regards,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ampascual</strong> on 12 Mar 2016, 15:13)</p>
