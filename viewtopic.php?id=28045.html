					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>first of all thanks for the great 10.03 backfire release which is pretty stable and fast on my WRT54GL.</p><p>So far I secured my network pretty well and also have arpwatch in place as well as I check the DHCP leases myself almost daily.</p><p>As I have lots of wifi networks around me, I&#039;d like to be able to detect both dictionary attacks as well as people trying to enter the network with wrong WPA2 PSK. I&#039;d be very interesting to me and I think others also if you have an idea for it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>derjanni</strong> on 8 Jan 2011, 21:00)</p>

					<p>Write a wiki-page on securing your network (I speak german, so no problem with translation) and I&#039;ll think about giving you some support with your particular problem.</p><br /><p>You all want free software and free support but are not willing to share your knowledge and experience with others. That is not how OpenSource works!</p><br /><p>Anything you did or you had to do, because it is not covered by the vanilla settings, could be interesting. For example this:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/accessdslmodem">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/accessdslmodem</a></p><p>No big deal, but it could save the next fellow some time. Also, you can learn from this, that some dsl-modem can be accessed. And maybe solve some problems by yourself.</p><p>The point is, that we have no manpages, and also the Info about a package is quite short. Links to the debian/ubuntu/gentoo/arch wiki could be interesting, too. To mention the basic idea is already cool, but to write a little howto/recipe is even better.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok Orca,</p><p>I&#039;ll write some wiki pages and also one about securing the network and then you&#039;ll provide me some infos :-)</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>JAn</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />the attack on WPA/WPA2 is done offline after the attacker captures the handshake packets exchanged between the router and the station.<br />The process of capturing the handshake can be absolutely passive.For more info try google.<br />About the secound question Ii believe you can check system log for failed authentication attempts.<br />If you want to be secure enough use long keys with alfa-numeric,lower and uppercase combined with some special characters like +-!@... etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>+1 A patient hacker listen (undetectable) all day long for a single handshake packet from a genuine connection. An impatient one may inject a (detectable) deauthentication packet to force the handshake in a genuine connection.</p><p>Then offline check (undetectable) the packet against a publicity available dictionary. You may offline check your key too against same dictionary. Please DON&#039;T use a online service!</p><p>Below this point you have a weak key, can stop reading now.</p><p>Next step is to bypass the MAC filter: Use the MAC of the router (can&#039;t filter itself but is detectable) or use a captured one at times (noticeable) when not in use. At times when in use may inject a (detectable) deauthentication packet to (noticeable) disconnect a genuine MAC owner.<br />If you have a strict connection schedule can use crontab to follow it turning on and off the radio.</p><p>Next step is to obtain a (detectable) DHCP lease. Really? Use a captured IP/MAC instead without ask for a lease, but can&#039;t avoid the (detectable) ARP registration.</p><p>If you read so far then you are already owned. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /></p>									</div>
