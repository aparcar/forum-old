					<p>Getting GPS to work through a mobile broadband card usually requires an active subscription and for the phone company to provision it with GPS, most do not.</p><p>Most of those mini-PCIe mobile broadband cards are actually USB.&nbsp; The PCIe bus also includes a USB connection (not all hosts have it though).&nbsp; The card doesn&#039;t even connect to the PCIe bus wires, it just draws its power from the slot and communicates over USB.&nbsp; USB links don&#039;t do PPS well, as USB is a polled system with tens of ms latency.</p><p>You should look into a bus-connected serial port and a dedicated GPS receiver with PPS output to one of the status pins on the port.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 4 May 2015, 17:32)</p>

It&#039;s worth trying the GPS_START command on all serial ports, just in case they moved the GPS port.&nbsp; But interface #0 is most likely QMI/RMNET.&nbsp; At least we&#039;ve handled it like that ever since Linux v3.4, and never received any complaints <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>It&#039;s also possible that the GPS is disabled by default, and that you need some magic Huawei AT command to enable it.&nbsp; Do you have it working on Windows?&nbsp; In that case, then try snooping on Windows to figure out how it is enabled.&nbsp; I recommend USBPCap for Windows USB snooping: <a href="http://desowin.org/usbpcap/">http://desowin.org/usbpcap/</a></p>									</div>
