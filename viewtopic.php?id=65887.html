					<p>OpenWrt uses dnsmasq as a caching nameserver; thus, all process (except dnsmasq itself, obviously) are configured to send their request to the local host, then dnsmasq forwards those request to the upstream DNS.

					<p>Thanks Max Hopper,</p><p>Unfortunately, that doesn&#039;t solve my problem, in that OpenWRT odhcpd still advertises the link-local address of the LAN interface on RDNSS. Which means all IPv6 clients will still be asking OpenWRT for DNS resolution, and now (using your method) it has reached a dead end. What I really want is control over RDNSS field in the RA.</p><p>BTW, I have solved this problem by disabling RAs in odhcpd and resurrecting radvd (not in Chaso Calmer) from a previous release, where I have better control over the RA. Now I can point my Chromebook and Android devices to my DNS server directly.</p><p>thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cvmiller</strong> on 2 Jul 2016, 07:17)</p>

					<p>Throwing out odhcpd completely might be the better option (isn&#039;t installed here). Dnsmasq does RA as well, no need for radvd. /etc/resolv.conf on the router only contains loopback address, and clients only have the router as nameserver listed, albeit under multiple addresses (ipv4, ipv6, linklocal). So all queries need to go through dnsmasq and dnsmasq can be configured to look up as you like.</p><p>If you want to prevent rouge clients or applications to use another nameserver use iptables.</p>									</div>
