					<p>I&#039;ve seen some posts on running various WRTs off 12V gel batteries but I was wondering if anyone has had any success on a smaller more portable solution. </p><p>I tried with an old 7.2V (read in at 8V) car battery and a WGT634U. It successfully booted up and powered for 30 minutes before it rebooted and hanged on config.</p>									</div>

					<p>According to this page:<br /><a href="http://people.zoy.org/~walken/wgt634u/HOWTO.html">http://people.zoy.org/~walken/wgt634u/HOWTO.html</a></p><p>The voltage regulators of your WGT634u are reputed to accept anything in the 12V to 6V range.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure if you search the web you can find more detailed information.</p><p>This will assume of course you have the amperage to back that up.&nbsp; The &quot;A&quot; figure is important.&nbsp; If your device uses a 12V 1A wart for example, and you substitute that with a tiny adapter that can supply 12V but only at 200 mA this will not work.&nbsp; A larger battery would have more depth to it as far as supplying current, so would run longer.</p><p>I do not know about your device, but the WRT54GL units will run from deep-cycle marine batteries for a week or more. These batteries are quite large though.&nbsp; In general for battery applications, I would look for a router that will accept a wide voltage range.&nbsp; The voltage regulator parts will be labelled and you can look up the numbers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the VRM&#039;s in common usage will accept anything from 7V to 40V which gives you a bit more room to play with than the 6V-12V type.</p>									</div>
