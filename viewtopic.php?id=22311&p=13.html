					<p>A kind developer on the ath9k list (Daniel Ma) took an interest in the multiple-VIF problem and posted a <a href="https://lists.ath9k.org/pipermail/ath9k-devel/2010-April/003372.html">patch</a> for it. That particular patch doesn&#039;t compile against the current wireless included in OpenWRT, but I tweaked the line numbers to get a patch that you can drop into <a href="http://wndr3700.nfshost.com/999-vap-group-key.patch">package/mac80211/patches/999-vap-group-key.patch</a> with OpenWRT&#039;s current compat-wireless-03-24.</p><p>I&#039;ve been running it for a day and it seems to have fixed the problem with virtual interfaces for me. (If you apply this patch and are thinking about upgrading only the modules on an existing system, don&#039;t forget that you&#039;ll need to reinstall all of kmod-ath9k, kmod-mac80211 and kmod-cfg80211. If you do what I did and try to just reinstall ath9k only, you&#039;ll be greeted by a nice kernel panic...!)</p><p>On a different note:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>zorxd wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The log shows nothing specials... I don&#039;t have ath9k debugging compiled in (maybe I should?).<br />In dmesg, I see only a lot of :<br />nf_ct_snmp_trap: dropping packetIN= OUT=ppp0 .....<br />and of :<br />device wlan1 entered promiscuous mode<br />br-lan: port 3(wlan1) entering forwarding state</p><p>but I don&#039;t think it is related.</p></blockquote></div><p>What do you get if you grep the log for hostapd messages from around that time? I&#039;m thinking about stuff like this, for example:</p><p>Apr&nbsp; 2 21:48:47 openwrt hostapd: wlan1: STA 00:1e:c2:xx:xx:xx WPA: pairwise key handshake completed (RSN)<br />Apr&nbsp; 2 21:49:06 openwrt hostapd: wlan1: STA 00:1e:c2:xx:xx:xx IEEE 802.11: disassociated<br />Apr&nbsp; 2 21:49:07 openwrt hostapd: wlan1: STA 00:1e:c2:xx:xx:xx IEEE 802.11: deauthenticated due to inactivity</p><p>As for my own wireless issue, I realized that I also upgraded my client OS at around the same time as I started having the problems, so I think it may actually be unrelated to the router. I should know more in a few days.</p><p>As for chipped87&#039;s questions about 300 Mbps: at least at 5 GHz, my recent connections are settling around 162-216 Mbps, but the driver is seemingly trying to get it running faster with limited success (build 20599):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    HT    MCS   Rate    Success    Retries   XRetries        PER

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I saw in the post from enodiesop (2010-02-17) that &quot;iw phy1 info&quot; (or &quot;iw list&quot;) lists txpower values above 20 dBm.<br />On my system &quot;iw reg get&quot; lists frequencies where more than 20dB are allowed, but &quot;iw list&quot; or &quot;iw phy1 info&quot; always displays 20dBm on them.<br />So I can&#039;t set more than that. What could be the problem/a solution.<br />And how to find out what the hardware itself is capable off. (so if 27dBm are okay for the WNDR3700 on the 5GHz interface)</p><p>By the way, the luci interface displays the txpower set on the 5GHz interface on the 2,4GHz one (when Network/Wifi is selected). On the 5GHz one no power level is displayed here in luci. I Think this is a general bug, can anybody verify this (tested with 10.03-RC3)?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Alex</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Halo2</strong> on 4 Apr 2010, 19:45)</p>

I would goto <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/netgear/wndr3700</a> for directions on compiling your own image to get you started. You can goto <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">http://www.virtualbox.org</a>/ and download VirtualBox then goto <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download</a> to get a linux image that you can install into VirtualBox. From there you have a linux environment in windows that only needs a few more packages installed to get a build environment up and running. One thing the wndr3700 wiki doesn&#039;t mention as a package dependency for building an image is that you need libncurses5 installed (or is it libncurses5-dev, I can&#039;t remember but its a virtual os so having both won&#039;t hurt, I actually have both installed) in addition to the other packages listed for ubuntu.</p><p>P.S.</p><p>You don&#039;t even need to touch /etc/config/wireless in ssh. Just install luci and config everything from there, the latest trunk and backfire rc3 both support switching between 5 and 2.4 (right frequency??) and also between HT20 and HT40+/-. Once I switched to the HT40- I think I had to reboot or maybe log back into luci again to get the update channels to show up in wifi setup (don&#039;t remember which). You can alternatively use a custom channel and not worry about it; I think 153 should give the best results and either HT40+ or HT40-. Then you don&#039;t need to worry about when luci populates the channel selection menu with the new channels though it will eventually.</p><p>P.P.S.</p><p>If you have a dual core or quad core processor I would recommend doing make -j2 V=99 or make -j4 V=99 instead of just make or make V=99. The V=99 gives you more output so you can see where any compile errors happen. The -j2 and -j4 will do more than one job at a time making better use of multiple processors and speeding up the compile time significantly.</p><p>P.P.P.S Lol, anyways. My config looks similar to yours except I am using wpa2 personal security and my htmode is HT40- instead of HT20.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skarlson</strong> on 6 Apr 2010, 22:29)</p>

What I would also say is for using luci to edit fstab I think you need to have block-mount and block-hotplug installed to actually get the drive to mount when you turn the router on or when you plug it in. I do not know if luci will even attempt to mount it the first time you add a mount point via luci with the drive already plugged in without those packages plugged in (or with for that matter, I think it required a reboot for me or unplugging and plugging back in or manually mounting via ssh, on subsequent reboots or plugins however the drive automounts with the packages I mentioned installed).</p><p>For ntfs drives if you want read/write access you need ntfs-3g installed and you cannot auto mount the drives at least as of the last time I tried. You cannot use mount at all though according to ntfs-3g documentation you can; openwrt mount doesn&#039;t seem to like it. To mount the ntfs drive do ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt via ssh; manually in otherwords. This is a start I hope; it will get you a working share though not one with user/password. I did manage to get user/password (user security mode) working but you have to edit security policy in Windows 7 for compatibility and you also need to setup a user/group with privileges on the folders you want to have accessed and I don&#039;t have time to explain that right now. I hope this is a start; let us know how it works!</p>									</div>
