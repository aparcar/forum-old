					<p>This <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/33219">r33219</a> may answer the first part of your question, for the second part - you won&#039;t be able to add a third antenna. The TL-WDR3600 is a 2-stream device (for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), while the TL-WDR4300 uses 2-streams for 2.4 GHz and 3-streams for 5 GHz - so its third antenna is only used for 5 GHz operations.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 12 Sep 2012, 22:13)</p>

					<p>The TL-WDR4300 has two wlan cards, one 2-stream 2.4 GHz radio (AR9344) embedded into the SoC and one separate 3-stream 5 GHz radio (AR9580) on the same PCB, but this is logically an independent card that just shares the same PCB with the router SoC.</p><p>For the TL-WDR3600, I assume that this separate 5 GHz wlan card, at least its PHY, has been switched with a 2-stream variant, so just soldering on an antenna won&#039;t make it work. Unfortunately both PCB pictures for TL-WDR4300 and TL-WDR3600 are not detailed enough to read the chip model numbers (in the lower left), however it is obvious that quite a few SMD components in the path to that vacant antenna connection are missing on the TL-WDR3600 picture - so even if there was the same MAC/ PHY used, it would get pretty hard to assemble all the missing SMD components to make that antenna work. Keep in mind that the in-SoC 2.4 GHz radio only uses 2 antennas either way.</p>									</div>

					<p>hello, i have been trying to find some answers before i get a few of these routers; hoping someone here can clear things up or correct me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>1. are these dual band antennas unique? ie. can any other dBi antennas be a drop in replacement?<br />2. if they are unique, is a unique antenna extension cable required aswell? or will a generic one work?</p><p>i cant find any images on the sma connectors for these routers. ive emailed tp-link back n forth. they said that;</p><p>cut n paste of their replies below</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br />1. The max wireless transmit power is 22dBm.<br />2. For your problem, there is three antennas in the TL-WDR4300, they are the same, for the 2.4GHz and 5 GHz at the same time.<br />3. Sorry that you can not to use 20bi omi antenna for one, 20bi uni antenna for one and leave the existing antenna for one to cover local area.<br />4. If you want to change the antenna to extend the range, you have to change all of them at the same time with the same frequency range.<br />5. For products to be recommended, please refer to this link.<br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/?categoryid=217">http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/?categoryid=217</a></p><p>1. Sorry that at this moment, we have not got 22bBm antenna.<br />2. We do not recommend you to change the antenna, because the TL-WR4300 is a<br />dual band router, the antenna we sell are all signal band.<br />3. To change the antenna to single band may affect it&#039;s stability.<br />5. To get the tx power, would you please be kind enough to get it changed<br />from dBm by googling how to convert them, it will be appreciated very much.</p><p>1. Sorry that the TL-WDR4300 cannot be used at Access Point mode.<br />2. You want to get several TL-WDR4300 , and set WDS between these routers to<br />cover more range, right?<br />3. Please refer to this link to set up the WDS<br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/article/?faqid=440">http://www.tp-link.com/en/article/?faqid=440</a><br />4. For the dual antenna, sorry at this moment, we have not got dual band<br />antenna to sell.we still do not suggest you to replace the antenna , If you<br />insist you can buy the dual antenna of other band, and it may affect the<br />stability.<br />5. As for the max wireless transmit power in mw, 22 dBm converting to mw is<br />about 102mw.<br />6. Yes the dual band antenna need the dual band cable.</p><p>1. Sorry for the late reply and the fact that the TL-WDR4300 can not used at<br />AP mode.<br />2. And for using the DDWRT or some firmware like that, we have to get you<br />informed.<br />3. Some official firmware of TP-LINK products can be replaced by the third<br />party firmware such as DD-WRT. TP-LINK does not provide technical support<br />and does not guarantee the performance and stability of third party<br />firmware. Damage to the product as a result of using third party firmware<br />will void the product&#039;s warranty.<br />&lt;/snip&gt;</p>									</div>

					<p>Without being able to read that link, OpenWrt most likely won&#039;t install on a TL-WDR4320 without -at least- minimal changes to the firmware headers (similar to the previous adaptions needed for the TL-WDR4310).
