					<p>Since I am a python fan, I have the same idea for a long time. <br />Introducing python&nbsp; into openwrt could be a great idea since there&#039;s a huge amount of fantastic tools.<br />but a fully-featured python cost too much flash &amp; ram. We need to wait for the time when all routers come with giga flash &amp; ram. haha. that day is coming..</p>									</div>
