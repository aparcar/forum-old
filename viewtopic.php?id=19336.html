					<p>Hi,</p><p>Been a while since I&#039;ve been on but trying to get back into the swing of things with Kamikaze.</p><p>I have a net4526 and I&#039;m trying to PXE boot it.&nbsp; Followed the instructions here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/SoekrisPort">http://wiki.openwrt.org/SoekrisPort</a></p><p>Here is what I have done so far:<br />1.&nbsp; I copied the openwrt-x86-vmlinuz (from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/x86/)">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/x86/)</a> to my /tftpboot dir as vmlinuz.ram<br />2.&nbsp; My /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default file looks like:<br />serial 0 38400 0x303<br />console 0<br />label linux<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel vmlinuz.ram<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; append init=/etc/preinit console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400n8 reboot=bios</p><p>... and when I boot f0, I see the kernel download but then nothing after that.&nbsp; </p><p>So my questions are:</p><p>1. What kind of kernel is the openwrt-x86-vmlinuz?&nbsp; Does it have kernel + ramdisk?<br />2. If openwrt-x86-vmlinuz doesn&#039;t have a ramdisk, then it looks like I would need to download the development environment and config the target for ramdisk.&nbsp; If I did all that, what should my config above look like?&nbsp; Would this look like the .tgz example on the SoekrisPort page?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what my config file should have.</p><p>I got this board used and it has a install of monowall on it.&nbsp; Would I need to erase that before trying to PXE boot OpenWRT?&nbsp; Just for kicks to see if my PXE setup was working, I found a Pyramid kernel and copied it to my /tftpboot directory as vmlinuz.ram and did a boot f0.&nbsp; It downloaded and the kernel ran (saw kernel message on the screen) but then it rebooted and the monowall install ran <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />.&nbsp; But at least I know my PXE/DHCP setup is working.</p><p>Would like to hear from folks that have done PXE booting before.</p><p>TIA!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hutchman</strong> on 12 Mar 2009, 20:53)</p>

					<p>Update.</p><p>The openwrt-x86-vmlinuz I downloaded from kamikaze/8.09/x86/ just gives a blank screen when I PXE boot it on a Soekris net4526 (Elan SC520 .. not Geode).</p><p>So, thinking that the image didn&#039;t have a ramdisk, I downloaded kamikaze_8.09_source.tar.bz2 and did menuconfig to change Target Images-&gt; to ramdisk.</p><p>This image did the same thing.&nbsp; Blank screen.&nbsp; (minicom capture shows vmlinuz ...... ready and nothing follows).&nbsp; Sounds like this same problem: <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org/msg02254.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-dev … 02254.html</a></p><p>Next I downloaded trunk with SVN.</p><p>Configured target for net45xx, Target Images -&gt; ramdisk.<br />Did make which failed on hotplug2.&nbsp; Noticed URL path was wrong in Makefile.&nbsp; Edited Makefile to right path ... <a href="http://isteve.bofh.cz/~isteve/hotplug2/downloads/hotplug2-0.9.tar.gz">http://isteve.bofh.cz/~isteve/hotplug2/ … 0.9.tar.gz</a> (downloads was missing).&nbsp; Turns out it didn&#039;t help as my companies firewall was messing something up so I finally just downloaded the files manually into the kamikaze/dl dir. Build finished after I did that.</p><p>This image PXE boots up OK (reports bleeding edge, r14843)</p><p>Just wanted to post an update.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have net4521. I downloaded the x86 package. dd it to CF card and booted the box. I have excactly the same problem. The grub menu show, then item is chosen and it stops like this. This is the last line i see:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> 
Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83                                                                           
kernel  /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda2 rootfstype=ext2 init=/etc/preinit  noinitrd console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400n8 reboot=bios
[Linux-bzImage, setup=0x2a00, size=0x11ae3c]
boot</code></pre></div><p>I tried:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.1/x86/openwrt-x86-ext2.image">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … ext2.image</a><br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09.2-RC2/x86/openwrt-x86-ext2.image">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8 … ext2.image</a><br />Then i rebuilt the openwrt images based on 8.09.1 using generic or soekris from build menu. <br />Still the same.</p><br /><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Well, what do you know - took the svn r17603. Compiled it, and it works. Chose net45xx from menu.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jannoke</strong> on 17 Sep 2009, 20:08)</p>
