					<p>I just installed Openwrt on ASUS WL-520GU.&nbsp; The installation is very smooth and OpenWRT works well.&nbsp; However, the router has only 4MB internal flash.&nbsp; It limits the program I can install.&nbsp; Since it has a USB port, I can mount an USB drive to it to increase memory.&nbsp; My question is if I can use the additional memory to install more packages.&nbsp; If the answer is yes, is there anything special I need to do?&nbsp; Do I need to mount the drive at a particular position or need to link it to a particular directory?&nbsp; <br />I am new to OpenWRT so please forgive my ignorance if this has been discussed previously.<br />Thank in advance for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>If the only objective is to add space to install more packages, it should be possible to mount the USB drive and install the packages there as the same reference shown in the &quot;alternative&quot; section.&nbsp; I am experiment this and will report once have good results.</p>									</div>

					<p>You really don&#039;t need to use extroot if all you want to do is to use more space to install extra packages.&nbsp; You can simply mount a usb drive.&nbsp; Copy the major directories, e.g. /etc, /usr, /var, /lib, /bin and /sbin to the USB root.&nbsp; Then do a mount -obind of these USB directories back to the corresponding directories.&nbsp; For RAM, it is always possible to format a partition of the USB drive as swap space and do a swapon followed by the name of the USB swap partition.&nbsp; Of course it will not be ideal to swap in and out too often but if only one program need a large chunk of ram but the others are not that active, hopefully the opportunity of read/write from/to the USB drive will not be very often.<br />I just installed Asterisk 1.8 using Mario&#039;s latest patch on the ASUS WL-502GU with a USB drive and it appears working well.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any additional delay at all.&nbsp; There are up to 2M swap space were used.&nbsp; However, since Asterisk need about 9M ram while 520GU has 16M RAM, I guess Asterisk can allocate all its needs inside the RAM.</p>									</div>
