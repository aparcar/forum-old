It [tabs] allows for a substantial amount of information to be enclosed within a very small footprint.&nbsp; For example, <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1x00ac_series#openwrt_builds">OpenWrt Builds</a> &amp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1x00ac_series#community_builds">Community Builds</a> have been drastically shrunk and now have an extremely clean look.<br /></p><ul><li><p>I purposefully did not utilize the tab plugin under certain sections, as the use of tabs would have served as a hinderance, such as under the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1x00ac_series#synopsis">Firmware Synopsis</a>, as well as under topics with instructional sets.&nbsp; <br /></p><ul><li><p>The one exception to this is the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1x00ac_series#flashing_firmware">Firmware Flashing</a> section, as the steps for each type of flash contained two separate actions, 1st Backup, 2nd Install.<br /></p><ul><li><p>I utilized tabs here as it offers a clear distinction between two entirely different actions.&nbsp; Due to how DokuWiki works, it creates a hindrance when trying to format in a specific manner, specifically with indenting and bullet type lists. For example, indenting is locked to one tab width only, and one tab width to the right cannot be exceeded; More than one space is recognized as a maximum of one space; Indents cannot be utilized within bullets (i.e. new paragraph under an existing bullet, but not a bullet itself).</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>It standardizes the information layout from one section to the next, resulting in a view of cohesiveness for an end user when disseminating the information contained therein<br /></p><ul><li><p>For example, compare link buttons to bulleted links before... it&#039;s a night and day difference, offering a far more cohesive, and cleaner, look.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>The point I&#039;m making is I view all edits to the wiki with all users in mind, always contemplating how the information will appear to a user on a desktop, a laptop, or a mobile device.&nbsp; <br /></p><ul><li><p>For example, if one maximizes, then halves, the screen, all wiki information moves accordingly, resizing to proper relative proportions.&nbsp; (While it took a lot of testing, I was finally able to narrow down the proper em wrap values.)</p></li><li><p>Take a look at the page as you scroll continually from top to bottom - all tab boxes are aligned and the same length across the board; this same proportionality is maintained with screen resizes.</p></li></ul><p>I don&#039;t make edits to the wiki to simply make edits.&nbsp; Each edit is viewed and tested by me at a minimum of 5x prior to being saved.&nbsp; My adherence to ensuring the wiki functions for all users is why each major edit requires hours to get to a completed state (I easily spent 16 hours working on the Wiki between Sat &amp; Sun).&nbsp; I don&#039;t simply make a formatting change on a whim, or simply because I prefer one thing over another - I make changes with everyone in mind, which comes back to my first sentence...

					<p>So I clean up a bit yesterday and wrote down some notes that might be helpful for eventual users/testers:</p><p>So the patch series is on top of openwrt github and uses kernel 4.7-rc7<br />tarball: <a href="https://gpldr.in/v/1QfrfTNxHp/n8Pa3C65ZInbl2nr">https://gpldr.in/v/1QfrfTNxHp/n8Pa3C65ZInbl2nr</a><br />sha256sum: 3dcc2ccdb306d03d69a0ceb9ddbfa017010998553e1701755c92f862ff8966eb</p><p>And the notes:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>== UBIFS

Needs to support overlayfs

Currently, any installation has the core utility mv broken, a bad joke for a
distro.

https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/19538

* jffs portion, not relevant to us, no upstream report found
    110-jffs2-use-.rename2-and-add-RENAME_WHITEOUT-support.patch
    111-jffs2-add-RENAME_EXCHANGE-support.patch

* ubifs still missing, no upstream report found

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== mwlwifi

* build failure with CONFIG_THERMAL=m
    fix included

* hostapd: WPA: group state machine entering state FATAL_FAILURE
    hack from compat-wireless package imported as band-aid
    quite possibly the same root cause as #55


== available mwlwifi packages

* kmod-mwlwifi
    The one from trunk, uses wireless-compat which doesn&#039;t support 4.7 yet.

* kmod-mwlwifi-nocompat (default)
    Uses kernel provided cfg80211 and mac80211

* kmod-net-mwlwifi
    Can be used to test what it would be like if the driver were upstreamed.

* mwlwifi-firmware
    Firmware belongs into linux-firmware or a separate package.

== hostapd-vanilla

Was a great help debugging wireless, included so it may help others.

== crda

unhealthy build host dependencies, also builds on uevents, how are they
best handled in openwrt?

As built-in reg-db is officially supported use it like comapat-wireless does
in openwrt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Bug fixes

Looks like a valid bug with fix, no clue why it wasn&#039;t simply upstreamed

551-ubifs-fix-default-compression-selection.patch

can be ignored as support for both is enabled anyway

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== I broke

* kmod-button-hotplug kmod-gpio-button-hotplug depend on

910-kobject_uevent.patch
911-kobject_add_broadcast_uevent.patch

no interest in fixing right now

* kmod-ledtrig-usb depends on

820-usb_add_usb_find_device_by_name.patch

Would be nice to have it working. Though the one openwrt offers isn&#039;t handling
the second led for usb3 anyway. What is it supposed to signal in the first
place? Checking the linksys sources to see what they are doing might be an
option to figure that out.

* kmod-ledtrig-libata dropped

Requires changes to libata, fine as user patch, sure you can ifdef it but fact
remains linux can control multiple leds per disk out of the box (usecase nas).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Initramfs

As a replacement for a dozen hacks to support dual firmware setups.

Build ubi as module so we can create a block device using module parameter until
busybox supports ubiblock.

Well, a C version thereof probably would be tiny, but there is plenty space on
the kernel partition for busybox, which makes it easy for users to write a
custom init, even dracut might be an idea.

The buildroot support is crude but works fine as a proof of concept.
Suggestions on how to improve it are welcome.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== traffic contol

no pre-setup, use tc or one of those qos scripts available if you need to, the
defaults appear to work well for me so far.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== sysupgrade

* may flash active rootfs
* no need to shut down anything for flashing, procd can&#039;t do it properly anyway
* potentially the reason for what happened to david

Maybe I write a replacement utility which is less dangerous

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== patches in generic and mvebu

What is left converted to format patches, for easy rebasing on future kernels
as well as reviewing them in the first place. Also running off to a big linux
distro is easy that way ;)

Some of the dropped ones are actually harmful. Stuff like lsusb from busybox or
ss work again for example, netdata shows a few extra gauges as well. Others are
still sitting broken in noltaris staging tree. The price a distro has to pay
for so much baggage isn&#039;t little.

== files in generic and mvebu

To much abuse so use banned. Also more review friendly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Support

All 4 linksys wrt models.

Tested and working fine on shelby.

No binaries from me. If someone else wants to feel free to do so.</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>How does WRT1X00AC sort packets in WMM categories?<br />There are some related docs (e.g. <a href="https://www.bintec-elmeg.com/portal/downloadcenter/dateien/workshops/current_en/ws_wlan_html_en_HTML/vowlan_infra_qos_wmm.html)">https://www.bintec-elmeg.com/portal/dow … _wmm.html)</a> says DSCP bits in the IP-header maps to WMM categories. I did some experiments using <br />&quot;iptables -t mangle -I POSTROUTING -p icmp -j DSCP --set-dscp 0x38&quot;. <br />It works on the stock linksys firmware, ping packets has much lower delay(from ~200ms to ~50ms) over background tcp streams of iperf.<br />It does not work on openwrt, the ping is still getting high delay as the background data congested.</p>									</div>

Everything is right there and links to more info if wanted/needed. <br />Keep up the great work. Much needed. <br />--bill</p>									</div>
