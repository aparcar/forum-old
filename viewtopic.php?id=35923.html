					<p>I recently found one of my old routers and have been using it for learning the OpenWRT build. Surprisingly the WGT634U has 8MB flash and 32MB ram but I&#039;m thinking it might have too old a CPU for latest trunk and ath9k. I get this impression primarily because LuCI is very slow on it whereas LuCI on the WR1043ND is reasonably quick even without tweaking it.</p><p>Anyone guess if a ath9k 5GHz card would work ok or not? I would mod the case to use two antennas if it would work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the Compex WLM200N5 card working but it cannot reach it&#039;s potential because high CPU utilisation. The loadavg was well above 1 and [ksoftirqd/0] had high CPU utilisation.</p><p>I tested two ath5k, two ath9k and one acx based miniPCI cards and they all suffer the same issue. Sometimes the CPU utilisation increase progressed slowly for a short period of time so perhaps there is hope of a patch to solve the problem.</p><p>Wired file transfer was at maximum speed with almost zero CPU utiilisation. </p><p>I reverted back to the netgear stock firmware with the original miniPCI wireless card and during wireless transfer the serial console was also very sluggish during peak wireless transfer suggesting the same issue exists so perhaps the issue has always existed?</p><p>Anyone have any hints how to diagnose this issue or will confirm it&#039;s likely a lost cause?</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried tweaking MAX_SOFTIRQ_RESTART which is hard coded to 10 in the source code. I created /sys/kernel/max_softirq_restart which allowed me to change it while testing and wireless throughput was ~2.75MB/sec (connected at 300Mbps) regardless of setting it to 1 or 1000. Lower values were much more responsive when typing at the serial and ssh console yet throughput was virtually unchanged.</p><p>I&#039;m still interested in learning so any hints on how to proceed to find out more about the mediocre performance would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>right away, i would see the following cpu-intense processes when using wireless compared to wired transfers: ciphering (WPA/WPA2), firewall/packet filtering, data transfer between wired and wireless interface.<br />you won&#039;t be able to influence the last one, but for testing purpose, you could temporarily disable firewall and/or ciphering and see how it goes.</p>									</div>
