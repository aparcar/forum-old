					<p>hey all,</p><p>im developing a little GUI that will login to a openwrt router, and so far ive got it working somewhat. Its using Appgate&#039;s mindterm java ssh terminal (http://www.appgate.com/products/5_MindTerm/ --- the BasicClient example file to connect), and it opens a terminal with the GUI. In the end, i will get rid of the terminal so that you dont need to see the command lines, but for the time being i need to make sure commands are reaching the router and being executed.</p><p>I ran into my first problem today - i have made a method to execute commands (using RunRemoteCommand2 example file), but when i try to use the method to send a command to the router, the ssh connection is dropped and i get an error message saying so. Can anyone take a look at the Mindterm library and&nbsp; try to help me out here?</p><p>basically i have a button in my gui mapped to run a &quot;ls -l&quot; command and print it to the terminal.</p><p>If you need code or anything, let me know or instant message me.</p>									</div>

					<p>the error i get is:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&quot;SSH2Transport.disconnectInternal() : &#039;disconnect: Server closed connection&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I have a feeling that the problem has to do with interfacing with dropbear ssh or the ash shell. The program works fine when i login to my slackware linux machine using sshd, and it executes the &quot;ls -l&quot; command with no error.</p>									</div>

Some RPC over SSL protocol (maybe using some ash CGI script or summat) might be more appropriate.</p><p>Anyway, the disconnection problem can be caused by various things. Does your sshd log to syslog? If so, have it dump its output to a syslog server to see why it disconnects. Maybe it misses a valid terminal, or something. Can be anything. Without code and logging output, it&#039;s like walking in the dark on this, so please do post a tarball or somthing on the web (not that I&#039;d be any good at solving the problem, but still...)</p>									</div>
