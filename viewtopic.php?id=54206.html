					<p>Hello,<br />I have a TL-WR1043ND. I installed Openwrt but I made a mistake and I&#039;ve installed the trunk version. So I want to reinstall Openwrt but with the stable version. But after many tries I am unable to install the stable version.<br />I have tried to install directly from my Openwrt interface but that doesn&#039;t work.<br /> I have tried to reinstal my default firmware from TP Link and that turn off my openwrt interface. But when I install from my Tplink interface the new firmware and I go check to the Openwrt interface I see that the firmware is again the trunk... <br />How could I remove completly the openwrt and install my stable version cleanly?</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Please let us know exactly what files you are flashing (links please, not filenames).<br />If you can revert to stock, reflash with Barrier Breaker 14.07 final and use a &quot;factory&quot; file for your router. Make sure you have the correct hardware revision (v1 or v2). </p><p>If you are trying to flash from openwrt trunk to stable, then use a sysupgrade file and do not save settings. This assumes you used a factory file the first time around. It is ok to use a factory file again if you&#039;re not sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your replies <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Here is the link from my Barier Breaker stable version : <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">OpenWrt stable version</a> <br />I&#039;ve tried all you said but there aren&#039;t any change.<br />All the time when my flash firmware end and when I log to Openwrt(192.168.1.1) I have the same trunk version. <br />I have another TL-WR1043ND with stable version and all settings set correctly. So I tried to uppload his backup into my router. The settings change but there aren&#039;t any other change, the OS is still the trunk version.</p>									</div>

					<p>You could try from the command line, scp the new firmware into /tmp and then run sysupgrade.&nbsp; This will at least give you some feedback as to whether anything was actually flashed.</p>									</div>

					<p>My point was that it&#039;s always going to say &#039;LuCI Trunk&#039;.&nbsp; The important part is that if it also has &#039;14.07&#039;, you are running release Barrier Breaker.</p><p>Re-flashing like you did erases everything OpenWrt changed in your flash and replaces it completely with the new version.&nbsp; Only the factory bootloader and default settings are left, and you don&#039;t want to erase those.&nbsp; Those areas of flash were programmed at the factory and OpenWrt doesn&#039;t change them.</p>									</div>
