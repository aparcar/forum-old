					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I configured my OpenWRTs with wpad, Enterprise WPA2 (802.1X) and dynamic VLANs.<br />Everything works correctly a part from the associated stations list, that shows no clients.</p><p>Hoping that is not the expected behavior, how can I fix this issue?</p><p>On one installation I have multiple SSID (some 802.1X and some using WPA2 PSK) and the &quot;Associated Stations&quot; list only shows info about the WPA2 PSK clients.</p><p>Any help would be very appreciated! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Mmm... is there a way to get the associated 802.1X stations via command line?<br />If it&#039;s a LuCI specific issue I should be able to get the list some way right?</p>									</div>

You are right!<br />iw dev shows two additional interfaces (wlan0.20 and wlan1.20) and if I use station dump command on these I can finally see the connected STAs!</p><p>I wonder if there is a way to help LUCI detect those VLAN interfaces...<br />I tried the iwinfo command, but I get a &quot;not found&quot; error...

I would really like to see the code part of LUCI that retrieves the associated stations to see if there is margin for some tweaking <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Matwolf</strong> on 23 Aug 2017, 00:17)</p>
