					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Just moved from DD-WRT and so far, it looks like a good move!</p><p>I&#039;ve managed to set up most things, such as DNSOMATIC etc, but I am having some real problems getting custom DNS servers to work.</p><p>Basically, I want to use OpenDNS for all my requests and block all other outbound DNS queries. I&#039;ve followed the steps in the post below to the letter.....</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=31208">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=31208</a></p><p>...but I&#039;m afraid that if I change my DHCP clients to have static DNS entries of say 8.8.8.8, they bypass the OpenDNS ones set on the LAN and can still get out. I assumed a firewall rule that dropped all TCP + UDP packets from the LAN to destination port 53 would stop this, but it&#039;s not the case. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong and how I need to set it up?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>Nathan.</p>									</div>
