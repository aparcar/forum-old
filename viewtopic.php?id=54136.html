					<p>Hi All,</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vncrepeater">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vncrepeater</a></p><p>I need to install the vncrepeater on my:-</p><p>Buffalo WHR-HP-G54, OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1, LuCI 0.10.0 Release (0.10.0), Kernel Version 2.4.37.9</p><p>Not an issue installing it from packages (system/software).</p><p>I have edited the vncrepeater.conf, to suit 5901, the port my ChunkVNC compiled support ticket executable looks to at my domain, and just to be clear I can use this still (have been for 6+ years) on a local machine running a repeater, but I want to lose having to leave the machine on and naturally incorporating it in the router is brilliant.</p><p>I cannot ever get it to connect!</p><p>The forum link in the guide (above) is dead, but so far I have taken the further steps of my own accord trying to get it to work:-</p><p>edited the vncrepeater.conf (as stated above)<br />added firewall forwards (5901 &amp; 5900 &amp; 5500) to local machine, my router (Buffalo/OpenWRT) IP is 192.168.1.254, but should I change that to home? (127.0.0.1)<br />Started chmod a+x (0755) a few vncrepeater files as found, although some I could find were already 0777 (higher permissions).<br />started the program, at bash: vncrepeater start</p><p>It runs and on second to last line does show a FATAL so maybe this is the issue (which lead me to chmod/permission thoughts)</p><p>UltraVnc FATAL Thu Nov 20 20:26:07 2014 &gt; dropRootPrivileges(): getpwnam() failed</p><p>This is the first package I have installed, I hope there is more in the way of instructions for other packages <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Please help</p>									</div>

					<p>ALL WORKING</p><p>Thanks for all the help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Basically, and I am sure the is the easiest thing, but no amount of searching on here or google helped, just trial and error whenever I got ten minutes free at home!</p><p>To run the package, I needn&#039;t of put &quot;vncrepeater start&quot; from SSH window logged as root, but on its own &quot;vncrepeater&quot; is all that&#039;s required then you can also see the output log of the repeater similar to watching a log window in windows.</p><p>And although running &quot;vncrepeater start&quot; reported not being able to read vncrepeater.conf (in /etc) which I edited to 5901, running &quot;vncrepeater&quot; reports no such issues.</p><p>For noobs when editing vncrepeater.conf ports, use shift: then &quot;x&quot; to write out changes.</p><p>Also I tried forwarding the two required ports to 127.0.0.1, no joy, so went back to 192.168.1.254 and all fine, works very well, so a happy man.</p><p>I hope this helps someone else searching in this forum.</p><p>I just need to add to automatically start cant see that being an issue at all though.</p>									</div>
