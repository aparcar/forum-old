					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am trying to figure out how to assign IPv6 to my br-lan interface through obtained prefixes and statically configured suffix.</p><p>Example:<br />The provider is delegating one 64bit prefix to me: 2a00:1234:5678:9abc::/64<br />If I use option ip6assign, then br-lan ip is configured as 2a00:1234:5678:9abc::1, and router advertisments are sent to clients on the LAN.</p><p>However, there is a catch, as I want to have the IP 2a00:1234:5678:9abc::1 reserverd for another machine on the LAN, it causes me some trouble.</p><p>What I would like to do would be something like:</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;64&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6suffix &#039;::ffff&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # &lt;-- this option does not exist<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />Which would take all prefixes and append ::ffff (instead of ::1) to them and use it as the interface IP.<br />Note the non-existent option ip6suffix, which would indicate that the router should assign 2a00:1234:5678:9abc::ffff to the br-lan interface.</p><p>I believe that this must be possible in some other way, I just didn&#039;t try. I must be missing something. The chances that the ::1 suffix is hardcoded seems too low.</p><br /><p>The only workaround I found is to configure ip statically:</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6prefix &#039;2a00:1234:5678:9abc::/64&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6addr &#039;2a00:1234:5678:9abc::ffff/64&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />While this works for the scenario I described, I&#039;d like to make the configuration more universal, so it would work with multiple prefixes, and wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; need to be updated manually when prefix changes.</p><p>I know that my question is little bit confusing so if something is not clear, ask and I will try to clarify.</p><p>I have read the documentation many times and searched online, couldn&#039;t find anything helpful.<br />OpenWRT version: BARRIER BREAKER (Barrier Breaker, r46287)</p>									</div>

					<p>@CyrusFF</p><p>Thanks for info. </p><p>That option is not documented in the wiki, and I had missed the commit in January 2015 that introduced the option. <a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/netifd.git;a=commitdiff;h=0b0e5e2fc5b065092644a5c4717c0a03a9098dcf;hp=e9d2014a478807c7fac0581bb4a145901a3f23b4">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/netif â€¦ 901a3f23b4</a></p><p>I had been wondering why my second router liked to use the ::1, too, causing a warning to the system log about duplicate address (in the ULA segment). I had not noticed those warnings in 2014, so they looked a bit strange. But I did not investigate closer.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Thu Nov  5 17:08:54 2015 daemon.notice netifd: Bridge &#039;br-lan&#039; link is up

That fixed default ::1 can be a bit problematic if there are several Openwrt routers in LAN.</p><p>I added the ip6ifaceid option to my network config, and the error disappeared from the log. ;-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 17 Nov 2015, 21:53)</p>

					<p>It actually looks like what I want.</p><p>When I googled it, I found a patch adding this configuration option, it&#039;s from January 2015.</p><p>It didn&#039;t work, so I checked what version of netifd package I have, and it&#039;s something from September 2014 and no newer version is in the package feed that was preconfigured on my router (I have updated the lists).</p><p>I will need to try different package feed or try to compile myself.. </p><p>Anyways, thanx for your input.</p>									</div>

					<p>That netifd version with that option should be in trunk and cc15.05. But not in old Barrier Breaker14.07 or older releases.</p>									</div>
