					<p>Hi People,</p><p>I am using Barrier Breaker r34054 on a WNDR 3800 with LuCI r9414 as an interface.<br />I know both are old and I will deal with upgrading at a later date.</p><p>It looks like assigning a &#039;friendly&#039; name to a MAC is tied to assigning it an IP Address. Is this right?</p><p>What I would like to be able to do is to assign a friendly name to a MAC and assign an IP to friendly name or MAC for some of the devices. For some of the devices, I do not care what their IP address is. For others, I want them to have a static IP.<br />For all devices, I want to be able to refer to them via the host name I have assigned. </p><p>Is this possible?<br />If this is not something that is currently supported, what would it take to make it so?</p><br /><br /><p>-V-</p>									</div>
