					<p>I have SIP spammers from China trying to crack my OpenWRT( to make free calls using my Asterisk PBX system I guess).<br />I already lost $10 because of this (my PBX was open to all in these days, so I can&#039;t complain much)</p><p>But now they are sometimes making my router crash by trying to register with a random username (such as &quot;caller&quot;) and trying a lot of passwords. Is there something I can do to block these? Preferably I would not change the port number because the default is convenient.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I will try it. I couldn&#039;t figure a so complex rule myself. This shouldn&#039;t block anything else (such as real phone calls), right? Also since these spammers are really aggressive, I guess, so maybe I could lower that number of seconds to 30?</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you have your Asterisk PBX System hosted on your main NAT/Firewall router? If not, then don&#039;t do any ports forwarding to your Asterisk PBX System. If your Asterisk PBX System is hosted on your main NAT/Firewall router, at least heed the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=119861#p119861">suggestions</a> by <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/profile.php?id=10388">rAndy</a> to block others from trying to crack your Asterisk PBX System.</p><p>Both my Asterisk and FreeSWITCH PBX Systems are hosted on a Netgear <a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/products/model/a_id/2598">WGT634U</a> and a Seagate <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/network_storage/freeagent_dockstar">DockStar</a>, respectively, They both run on a self-built OpenWRT firmware and are connected to my main NAT/Firewall router (a Linksys WRT54GS v3 flashed with a DD-WRT firmware) without any ports forwarding. To this day, I have yet to encounter any crackings on both my Asterisk and FreeSWITCH PBX Systems.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes Asterisk runs on my OpenWRT router/nat/firewall/etc. WNDR3700.<br />The ports are open since I actually receive phone calls from the outside of my NAT.<br />I don&#039;t know how they found me but the fact is that they found me and that my IP address is static so I have to deal with them. They still didn&#039;t find one of my usernames (and I don&#039;t see them succeed in the future), so I don&#039;t see what blocking their IPs in each of my peers would change to that. Wouldn&#039;t asterisk still reply them with &quot;invalid user X&quot; anyway? Isn&#039;t this exactly what Asterisk does by default?</p>									</div>
