					<p>Hi,<br />Please I have read the list of supported router (Table of Hardware)<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a><br />I ask if any updates in the status of E3000 , E4200 and WRT-610N v2<br />if still work in progress or not work on yet, Can you advise me with a stable router that supports IEEE 802.11n at both 2.4 and 5 GHz and openwrt can support; so I can use it in my research on developing wlan throughput.</p><p>Thanks&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>e3000 and WRT-610N-V2.0 are identical hardware wise, just a different CFE and nvram config from what I gather.&nbsp; They are not very usable at the moment as the support for 2.4 kernel has been dropped from Trunk and there is no 2.6 support for the WIFI SoC and stand alone chip, or even the switch.&nbsp; There is a new 2.6 based linksys firmware, so hopefully a GPL release will be coming along soon.&nbsp; It is my understanding that e4200 uses the same WIFI SoC and switch, but a different secondary WIFI chip, so it is in a similar situation.</p>									</div>

					<p>I stand corrected.&nbsp; There is a patchset for E3000 and WRT610n-V2.0 routers which enables part of their capabilities.&nbsp; The SoC WIFI (2.4GHz) and switch are now working with the proprietary broadcom drivers on a 3.0.4 based build.&nbsp; The stand alone WIFI chip which provides A and N (5GHz) capability does not appear operational yet.&nbsp; The patchset is described:<br /><a href="http://www.znau.edu.ua/temp/asus-rt-n16/openwrt-bcm4716-README.txt">http://www.znau.edu.ua/temp/asus-rt-n16 … README.txt</a></p><p>Some of these findings have been included in the TOH entry for the E3000.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it still appears that these routers will not satisfy your current need until the other radio is enabled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm, the tag-plugin does not work correctly. The 3700 is tagged as well, but does not show up.</p><p>I cannot tell you, if there are problems with any of those devices, because I do not own one and the people who could (the ones who wrote the code for needed drivers, probably will not bother to do it. You best bet is to use &quot;your favourite search engine&quot; for reported problems.</p><p>The capabilities of the wireless drivers can be checked for here: <a href="http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers">http://www.linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers</a>&nbsp; so it is still safe to say, to avoid broadcom and buy atheros.</p><p>I do not think there is a wiki/information page for the USB/Ethernet/VLQN/etc. drivers. Read on the corresponding mailing list for Linux Kernel subsystem.</p>									</div>
