					<p>Hi Everyone,<br />I&#039;m pretty new here,<br />I&#039;m trying to compile my own version of openwrt for Compex WPJ344 with Atheros 10k. I downloaded the .config file from the latest development build and it gave me a bunch of errors when I ran &quot;make defconfig&quot;, saying that my packages had unmet dependencies. <br />Would anyone be able to help me out, and let me know how I can go about resolving these, please?</p><p>The warnings are as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>warning: (PACKAGE_minidlna &amp;&amp; PACKAGE_moc &amp;&amp; PACKAGE_mpd-full &amp;&amp; PACKAGE_sox) selects PACKAGE_libffmpeg-custom which has unmet direct dependencies (!ALL &amp;&amp; DEVEL)
