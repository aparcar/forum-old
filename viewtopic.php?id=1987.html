					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have observed some strange behaviour using OpenWRT on a Linksys WRT54G v1.0. This thread explains the trouble I was having:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1973">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1973</a></p><p>This post in particular outlines the behaviour I observed:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=9332#p9332">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=9332#p9332</a></p><p>At first I thought PEBKaM, but then a couple of things happened that I <em>know</em> I had nothing to do with. The router is running White Russian RC1 with no additional packages. Currently I&#039;m using 128 (104) bit WEP encryption until I get everything ironed out and I can concentrate on tightening up the security.</p><p>In short, I saw a discrepancy between what was set in nvram and what iwconfig reported, specifically in the area of the WEP encryption hex keys. Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zigguratt</strong> on 12 Jul 2005, 06:25)</p>
