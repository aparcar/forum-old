					<p>Hello,<br />I am trying to share my HP PSC 1510 all-in-one with Openwrt (Kamikaze 7.09).<br />I have installed these packages kmod-usb-uhci sane-backends&nbsp; sane-libs libusb libpthread xinetd.<br />I added 192.168.20.0/24 (which is my subnet) to /etc/saned.d/saned.conf.<br />I added&nbsp; sane-port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6566/tcp to /etc/services.<br />I put <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>

  group = root
  wait = no
  disable = no
}</code></pre></div><p>into /etc/xinetd.d/sane<br />I started xinetd.</p><p>On my client machine, I added 192.168.20.1 (IP address of OpenWRT box) to /etc/sane.d/net.conf.<br />I run scanimage -L as root (without sudo)<br />I get <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@bill:/etc/sane.d# scanimage -L

No scanners were identified. If you were expecting something different,
check that the scanner is plugged in, turned on and detected by the
sane-find-scanner tool (if appropriate). Please read the documentation
which came with this software (README, FAQ, manpages).

Logread on openwrt gives me:

One thing that would help me would be the scanimage command on OpenWRT box, but I would have to selfcompile it which I do not really want to do.</p><p>Have you got any ideas? If I can get this thing working, I will write a wikipage since the several threads here on the forums are rather confusing, but I am stuck now:-(.</p>									</div>
