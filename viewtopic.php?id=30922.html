					<p>Hi all,</p><p>What is the best router (from Netgear and Linksys routers) compatible with OpenWrt and other open source router distributions? I want to use it as a wired router. Also I need each port to be assigned to a different Ethernet (eth0, eth1, eth2, ...). Is it possible to run Bro-ids or Snort or Suricata on it?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Since you don&#039;t find OpenWrt on <a href="http://distrowatch.com/packages.php">http://distrowatch.com/packages.php</a>&nbsp; have a look at the repository: e.g. for ar71xx platforms and trunk: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/Packages">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … s/Packages</a> , snort is available</p><p>As for //best router//, there is none. And only few persons here, have experience with that many models. Read the buyer guide and answer what it is you want to do with it. I don&#039;t know, how much RAM and computing power snort needs and I have never heard of the other programs ;-) How much do you want to spent on it?</p><p>I compare prices here:&nbsp; <a href="http://gh.de/?cat=wlanrout&amp;sort=p&amp;xf=758_DD-WRT#xf_top">http://gh.de/?cat=wlanrout&amp;sort=p&a … WRT#xf_top</a> . It&#039;s pretty decent, although for some reasons they rather support DD-WRT instead of OpenWrt. Maybe we are not open enough?</p><p>In my experience, once you have a decent bootloader and good wireless drivers, the limited RAM is the biggest PITA factor, but this depends entirely on what software you later want to install on your router.</p><p>I would recommend the ar71xx platform and strongly recommend against broadcom.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks scruffy, your post was really helpful. Based on your post, I decided to get a router with ar71xx platform and in order to make my self more confident!, currently those with AR7161 680MHz and at least 64MB ram (NETGEAR WNDR3700, Ubiquity - RouterStation Pro, Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H, D-Link DIR-825) are my candidates:)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazaheris</strong> on 18 Jul 2011, 21:47)</p>
