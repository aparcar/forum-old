					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am thinking of installing openwrt in a raspberry to run as my home router.<br />My WAN is ADSL2+ (Germany). Dtelekom has promissed VDSL in the future.</p><p>As the Pi is not ADSL capable I was thinking of use an external device. Options are:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ADSL to USB adapter - If this exists and it is supported would be my best option.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;External Modem ADSL to ETH - But I had many problems with these in the past.</p><p>I could use a router with &quot;pass-through&quot; but I would like to keep it as simple as possible. Also, why to power a CPU for this ?</p><p>Has anyone already thought about it ?<br />Any idea ?</p><p>Many thanks in advance !</p><p>BTW - I need a proper device. I am running Asterix + openVPN + other tools in the router. I am tired of hardware with limited storage capacity and not enough memory.</p><br /><br /><p>Cheers</p><p>i$</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>idollar</strong> on 21 Nov 2016, 18:58)</p>

					<p>A RPi is not a suitable device for these tasks, even less with a prospect of VDSL (&gt;=50 MBit/s). While it would have the processing power and RAM, it simply lacks (networking-) I/O (both in terms of quantity and quality/ throughput), by a huge margin.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 21 Nov 2016, 22:57)</p>
