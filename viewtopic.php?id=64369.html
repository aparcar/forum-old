					<p>I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m having to rewrite this because the forum keeps bugging and my software environment doesn&#039;t keep copy-paste buffers.</p><p>I have a device used as access point.</p><p>Zones are lan and guest. Lan is a bridged ethernet-wifi device br-lan. The guest is on wifi called ath0-1.</p><p>Normally I drop traffic from guest to lan, but only if it has a destination of 192.168.1.0/24.</p><p>My LAN address is 192.168.1.2. My LAN gateway (other router) is 192.168.1.1.<br />My guest address is 192.168.2.1. Guest DHCP works and gives 192.168.2.100+ or something.</p><p>I can&#039;t get the thing to route stuff onto my LAN or beyond onto the internet.</p><p>From a Windows Phone (only wifi device at present) I can ping 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.1.2, both my addresses. However, pinging to 192.168.1.3 (for instance) fails. Destination unreachable.</p><p>The configuration for NAT masquerading is simply: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
        option name             lan
        option network          &#039;lan&#039;
        option input            ACCEPT
        option output           ACCEPT
        option forward          ACCEPT
        option masq             1
        option masq_src         &#039;192.168.2.0/24&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The ACCEPT targets are superfluous, the default policy for my system is now ACCEPT everywhere.</p><p>the masq option generates the following rule:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-A zone_lan_nat -s 192.168.2.0/24 -j MASQUERADE</code></pre></div><p>Without or without that source mask, it doesn&#039;t work. I may need to reboot my phone, otherwise I have no friggin clue.</p><p>All of the regular &quot;-m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT&quot;&nbsp; are everywhere. There is nothing getting denied.</p><p>It will allow me to SSH into 192.168.1.2 (which is my LAN address) as if it is masquerading that (and it should, right) but that&#039;s not actually true, my connection is with the original guest address:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tcp        0      0 OpenWrt.lan:ssh         Windows-Phone.lan:49445 ESTABLISHED</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ping Windows-Phone.lan
PING Windows-Phone.lan (192.168.2.138): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.2.138: seq=0 ttl=128 time=6.145 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.138: seq=1 ttl=128 time=6.561 ms</code></pre></div><p>So it is not masquerading into the input chain (which I guess, would be obvious).</p><p>And if it doesn&#039;t use POSTROUTING for that, no masquerading right.</p><p>But nothing happens trying to reach one of the LAN machines, NOR the internet.</p><p>Routing table:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

That used to happen when forward on br-lan was set to reject. Like what on earth is going on?</p><p>Relevant parts from /etc/config/dhcp:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dnsmasq
        list notinterface       lan

config dhcp guest
        option interface        guest
        option start            100
        option limit            50
        option leasetime        1h</code></pre></div><p>Everything from /etc/config/firewall:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config defaults
        option syn_flood        1
        option input            ACCEPT

        option proto            udp
        option target           ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>I am at wits end. Maybe I&#039;m missing something obvious? Connecting my phone to the br-lan SSID (lan zone) is without problems. But the audio device bugs out again. So now I am back with two issues:</p><p>- on &quot;openwrt_guest&quot; SSID I have no internet whatsoever, nor access to the local network<br />- my audio device doesn&#039;t get DHCP on the &quot;openwrt&quot; SSID (It will work using static addresses).</p>									</div>

					<p>By netfilter you mean IPtables right.</p><p>I do not understand why it wouldn&#039;t work. If I had a laptop it would be easier to troubleshoot.</p><p>I have studied the iptables rules extensively now. As I understand it, masquerading is not even required for forwarding of traffic, it&#039;s just that the destination won&#039;t be able to send it back.</p><p>Not unless I add a route to it. So I can even turn off the nat table / rule and see what happens, but I doubt it will do any good.</p><p>And indeed, I turn masquerading off and:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>20:27:25.289587 IP 192.168.2.138.49698 &gt; diskstation.localnet.ssh: Flags [S], seq 2169257541, win 8192, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 8,nop,nop,sackOK], length 0
20:27:28.299911 IP 192.168.2.138.49698 &gt; diskstation.localnet.ssh: Flags [S], seq 2169257541, win 8192, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 8,nop,nop,sackOK], length 0
20:27:34.291741 IP 192.168.2.138.49698 &gt; diskstation.localnet.ssh: Flags [S], seq 2169257541, win 8192, options [mss 1460,nop,nop,sackOK], length 0</code></pre></div><p>But it won&#039;t return traffic of course. I go to the 192.168.1.3 device and add:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.2 dev eth0</code></pre></div><p>And voila, I have a connection! I mean this might work too except this means changing routing tables on every freakin device. And I can! My router supports a static routing list. If the guest purpose is only to reach the internet anyway, then all I need is another route on the router that is the exit point.</p><p>Route added.... rebooting router.... And I have internet access on the guest network! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>So I think I understand *enough*. The thing just doesn&#039;t work if I masquerade it. As if the routing tables are corrupted, or the connection state tables, but that is impossible right. These things do not persist.</p><p>I can create my own snat/dnat rules, then maybe it will work. Probably. But -j MASQUERADE doesn&#039;t work for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> :-/ :-?.</p><p>It should know what to masquerade <em>to</em> (ie. 192.168.1.2) based on the interface right? (-o br-lan).</p><p>In any case this is not really a problem at this point. The purpose was for guest not to have access to LAN. In principle with --state established, related I should be able to reach hosts on the guest network if I initiate.</p><p>Hard to test. It is not bad just having 192.168.2.0 addresses roaming about. I will deny access to 192.168.1.0 including the router, but only because every destination address should be on the outside, for now.</p><p>At some point you might consider hosting services for such a guest network. Would be fun right.</p><p>But that&#039;s all easy to do. I just don&#039;t understand why it stops working if I add -j MASQUERADE.</p><p>Regular LAN devices though won&#039;t even be able to find the 192.168.2.0 addresses.</p><p>Guess devices will be. Able to. But. Won&#039;t get anything back.</p><p>So now I have added:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option src guest
        option dest lan
        option dest_ip 192.168.1.0/24
        option target REJECT</code></pre></div><p>And now the LAN is &#039;secure&#039; from my evil-minded guests (that also need a password <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />).</p><p>I wish I could use &quot;guest&quot; as an open node collecting sensitive data and youtube viewing habits from unsuspecting abusers of my internet connection <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />.</p><p>If they are going to get something for free, might as well pay for it.</p><p>You know, just a little database collecting URLs being viewed. Doesn&#039;t work with SSL/TLS unless you enable Squid thingies and then the squid server needs a verified root certificate to pull it off.</p><p>Hmmm.</p><p>Anyway.</p>									</div>
