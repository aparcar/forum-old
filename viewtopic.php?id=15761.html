					<p>Hi, I have an Asus wl-500gP and running Kamikaze trunk version (2.6) on it. My Asus gets an IP from my DSL router through the wanport. And sometimes the ip changes. So If I want to connect to my Asus I have to type a IP adresse like &quot;192.168.1.178&quot; now I don&#039;t want to check every time what IP adress my Asus gets. I want that I can reach my Asus with a name like &quot;my.asus&quot;. How can I do that and what config file do I have to change?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Oconnor</strong> on 23 May 2008, 00:13)</p>

					<p>You could just assign a static IP to your OpenWrt router&#039;s WAN interface, and then use your local /etc/hosts (%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts for Windows).</p><p>Or you could use a dynamic DNS provider-</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/DDNSHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/DDNSHowTo</a></p><p>Hope this helps,<br />Charlie</p>									</div>

					<p>Static IP isn&#039;t my solution. DNS provider wont work in a lokal lan. Is there no other solution? My Fritzbox is also connectable via &quot;fritz.box&quot;. Is there no package I can install like DNS or somethink else?</p>									</div>

I want that the router gets a name and I can connect to it via name like &quot;my.asus&quot; or something like that.

					<p>You have full control wether DHCP is used on Router ONE, If you only have your asus hooked to it, turn off DHCP, then use a static IP address on yoru Asus, then you can use /etc/hosts to define a name for your asus router.</p>									</div>

					<p>No I have about 20 PC&#039;s connected to router ONE. I can reach all of them via a name and not via a IP adresse. So is it not possible to give a router who is running openwrt a name?</p><p>The way I see is to update /etc/host with the wan IP Adresse, each time it is getting a new IP adresse. Is there a script that is doing that or is there an other way?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Oconnor</strong> on 26 May 2008, 11:44)</p>

					<p>I did not assign a name, all PC&#039;s are running Linux or Windows and I can reach the PC&#039;s by typing there &quot;login name&quot; . Like one PC has login name is &quot;Torsten&quot;. I can do &quot;ping Torsten&quot;. And my PC pings the IP adresse of &quot;Torsten&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Oconnor</strong> on 26 May 2008, 11:49)</p>
