					<p>Sorry, I misspoke, the samba download speed should actually reach about 10 MB/s (I guess you also got this when connected using ethernet), which is enough for practically any kind of HD material. It&#039;s the upload which is slow.</p><p>The wireless in RC6 is a bit unstable, also causing slow speeds, so try to upgrade to the final 10.03.1. Of course, the type of wireless client also affects the maximum transfer rate.</p><p>I use WZR-HP-G300NH for wireless media streaming, but the highest bitrate material I have is around 25 Mbps, requiring only about 4 MB/s transfer speed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>snk</strong> on 13 Jan 2012, 08:05)</p>

					<p>There seems to be an error in the original post. The additional settings should go to /etc/samba/smb.conf.template, from which (together with /etc/config/samba) /etc/samba/smb.conf is generated upon startup.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, if you already reach 10 MB/s when connected with a wire, but get slower speeds with wireless, samba is not the bottleneck. I have not personally tried the tweaks in the other thread, so I don&#039;t know how much they should help.</p><p>That said, 4-5 MB/s sounds normal for a 54 (802.11g) or 65 Mbps (1 stream, 20 MHz bandwidth, 802.11n) wireless connection. For higher wireless speed you should use 40 MHz bandwidth (which is not possible if there are other wireless access points nearby), and make sure that the client can handle two streams. Even then, you should be close to the access point so that the signal quality is high enough.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>snk</strong> on 14 Jan 2012, 12:36)</p>

					<p>Awsome! Your description does make sense.<br />I changed bandwidth from 20MHz to 40MHz+, now the shown wifi speed is 180Mb/s (on the web administration interface, and I&#039;m far away from the router), which can not be reached when I use the previous firmware. Now I can watch my 720p videos nearly without pause.<br />I&#039;ll show you more the performance tomorrow.</p>									</div>
