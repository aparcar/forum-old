					<p>The switch configuration looks correct, although I&#039;m a bit uncertain about the &#039;switch_port&#039; section. Can you explain why you need it there? What purpose does this setting serve in the context of your entire network topology?</p><p>As for not being able to ping the router, then you should also show your dnsmasq config from /etc/config/dhcp and your firewall config from /etc/config/firewall. If DHCP server is not specified correctly on &#039;lan1&#039; and &#039;lan2&#039; networks, then clients connected to the port might have invalid IP address, and thus traffic would not work. </p><p>On the other hand, if the networks are assigned to wrong zones or input traffic is blocked in the firewall config, then possible ping packets are dropped by the router.</p>									</div>
