Edit the following parameters provided in VM config file (.vmx )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ethernet0.connectiontype = &quot;nat&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ethernet1.connectiontype = &quot;hostonly&quot;<br />4. Bring up VM Ware with this config file ensuring the image file (.vmdk) is in the same path as the config file.<br />5. After booting up Openwrt, change /etc/config/network lan interface to belong in the same subnet as VMNET1 (xxx.xxx.xxx.2)</p><p>After these steps I could bring up multiple VMPlayer sessions and have ip connectivity between each of them.</p>									</div>

					<p>By looking at your configuration:</p><p>br-lan is bridged to eth1 (vmware) which is bridged to Vmnet1 (which should be configured as hostonly interface)</p><p>Ideally you should have got another interface <br />==&gt; br-wan bridged to eth0 (vmware) which should ideally be bridged to NAT VMNET8 (vmnet8 could be bridged to the NIC card)</p><p>You might be able to get br-wan up if you add the option type as bridge. This is assuming you would utilize this interface to connect to the NIC. You could specifically configure br-lan to eth1.</p><p>Coming to your issue, it could be mainly due to the ambiguity of two interfaces residing in the same subnet. I am speaking more from experience than any logic, but seems like the packets are not routed to the right interface. In your case it should have been routed to eth1, presence of two interfaces in the same subnet creates a confusion.</p><p>So a quick check would be to perform : ifconfig eth0 down</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Karthik,</p><br /><p>1) How do you know br-lan is bridged to eth1? I thought &quot;eth1 eth2&quot; means a bridge from eth1 to eth2 (although I don&#039;t have an interface 2)... I didn&#039;t quite understood that.</p><p>2) I did something now, and now eth0 is 192.168.15.133/255.255.255.0.

iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> a secure situation, but you can easily test with it!

					<p>Hello,<br />I am a DD-WRT user, I am running under Windows 2008 Hyper-V.<br />The current version of DD-WRT (r10020) has a serious security flaw and I need to upgrade.<br />I can&#039;t upgrade to newer build of DD-WRT becuase it will kenel-panic on boot from Hyper-V.<br />So I decided to instead move to OpenWrt, (I been reading that DD-WRT is not very GPL friendly)<br />I managed to boot the image, but I can&#039;t the NIC up.<br />I made sure that all kmod-e1000 plus more are installed in the image, still does not want to start network.</p><p>Any ideas, please help, thanks,</p><p>Oscar</p>									</div>

					<p>I just finished a port of VMware&#039;s open-vm-tools to Kamikaze 8.09 (as part of a work project).&nbsp; It mostly involved hacking out the X11 and some glibc requirements.&nbsp; I&#039;m running OpenWRT on ESX 4.0.<br />At this point i&#039;ve validated that vmware-guestd runs and I can use vmrun (the cli tool using the VIX libraries) and vSphere (VIC) to do things to it (like execute arbitrary commands, read the primary ip address and hostname, etc).<br />I haven&#039;t tried to get the hgfsmounter to work or the vmxnet ethernet drivers yet.&nbsp; The latter I&#039;ll be working on, the former I don&#039;t really care about.&nbsp; At any rate, I thought someone else using OpenWRT on vmware might be interested in this work to date and might want to help me finish out parts of it (like the hgfsmounter) that I don&#039;t plan on investing any real time into.<br />PM me if you&#039;re interested.</p>									</div>
