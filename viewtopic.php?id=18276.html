					<p>Hi all,</p><p>A while back I broke my WRT54G by reflashing the wrong version of something, and I had to use a JTAG cable to recover the unit.&nbsp; Since then I haven&#039;t been able to use the serial port on the device, either with the boot monitor or once the kernel has booted.</p><p>Has anyone else managed to get their serial port to stop working?&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering whether there&#039;s an NVRAM variable that needs to be set to get it to work? (given that I wiped the NVRAM during the recovery.)</p><p>While the box was working fine apart from this, I just tweaked the network config and managed to get the network (and wireless) to stop working, so now I really want to get into the unit via the serial port, otherwise I&#039;m going to have to do a reset and reconfigure everything from scratch again :-(</p><p>I&#039;m using a hacked USB to 3.3V cable from a phone, and it used to work fine with this same WRT54G (and it still works if I connect the TX and RX lines, I can see my typing in the terminal window), so the problem must lie with the 54G itself.&nbsp; Any ideas why my serial port isn&#039;t working?</p><p>I&#039;ve tried various baud rates with no success, but IIRC it used to work at 115200 8N1.</p>									</div>
