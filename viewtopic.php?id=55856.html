					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wonder if anyone can help with getting OpenWRT running on the Talktalk branded Huawei HG635, I&#039;m not very good with the development stuff but I reckon it should be relatively easy to get OpenWRT running on this hardware since Huawei have made some open source file downloads available for it here: </p><p><a href="http://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/downloads/detail/index.htm?id=28981">http://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/d … m?id=28981</a></p><p>It has also been opened up by some people here <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/modem-routers/talktalk-huawei-hg635-vdsl-802-11ac-router-1256378/review">http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac … 378/review</a></p><p>with the hardware and chipsets listed as:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>There&#039;s a single-chip multi-mode ADSL2+/VDSL2 Integrated Access Device (IAD) SoC, the BCM63168, a Gigabit switch solution, the BCM53124, a 5G WiFi 3-Stream 802.11ac Gigabit single-chip Transceiver, the BCM4360 and the BCM5302.</p><p>The router&#039;s design is fairly standard, with a vertical form factor that should signal propagation. The front houses six LED lights that indicate power, broadband, internet, wireless Ethernet and TV status while the back of the HG635 has the usual router details: a USB 2.0 port, reset button, WAN, RJ11 and four GbE RJ45 ports.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ll be grateful with any help how this can be done and I&#039;m sure a lot of people in the UK would be glad to have an image for this nifty piece of kit which can be found in many Talktalk serviced homes in the UK.</p>									</div>

					<p>- ADSL2+/VDSL drivers for Broadcom devices are closed source - there is no support for that part of the hardware<br />- Wireless BCM4360 is not supported by Linux because Broadcom does not release open drivers (see several other threads regarding routers with that radio)</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess, since there&#039;s support for hg655 and bcm63168, hg635 should now be easy to add on the supported hardware list. I have one and I would be more than happy to help with it. I&#039;m not new to linux, but very new to openwrt. From where can I start helping with? I need just the ethernet and the wireless part. Although more then happy to contribute to the xdsl one as well. </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

For the moment there isn&#039;t any bcm63168 with a NAND chip supported. Spite latest Linux kernels (&gt;4.1) has support for bcm63xx NAND controllers, the devs still didn&#039;t adopted any approach to deal with these NAND chips for making working firmwares in NAND flashes.</p><p>Looks like the main problem is the bootloader, that lives in the root partition, but openwrt can&#039;t include binaries in it&#039;s code, or at least the idea is to avoid it.</p><p>BTW if you want to help for eventual support, you could document the device, guessing things like the serial port pinout, good photos of the board, bootlogs, firmware dumps, oem sourcecode, and so on.</p><br /><p>Regards.<br />dani</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Dani,<br />I&#039;m not an expert, but I can do that in the next days. What I can assume until now is that the bootloader is CFE, because if you hold the reset button for ~20 sec while booting, you&#039;ll get a nice web page on <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> prompting for an image. I will post here images of the board and the bootlog, once the usb converter would arrive. First time for me in this experience <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Any help on how to guess pinout, get firmware dump and so on would be appreciated.</p><p>Fyi. I downloaded the source code mentioned on the first post (the onyl one available), and tried to make it compile. It is missing a lot of of files and there are traces of the dev that coded it (references on home directory in Makefiles/config files). Although it is based on linux, I don&#039;t know how much it has been modified. The kernel is 2.6.30 and there are the gpio drivers included. Although the board says 963168, in the kernel it is referred to as 963268 (I suspect drivers are the same for both boards?!).</p><p>Thanks!<br />Dario</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey. Is it possible to do this router on OpenVRT in the future or is it not subject to a new firmware? And place him with trash?</p>									</div>
