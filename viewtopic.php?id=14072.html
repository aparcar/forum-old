					<p>Hello!</p><p>I am trying to create my own QoS configuration, but I cannot make any filters to work.<br />I have problems with the most basic script as well:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tc qdisc del dev eth0.1 root

I create some traffic, but no packets arrive in the top priority class:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>qdisc sfq 11: limit 128p quantum 1518b flows 128/1024

					<p>There is no 1:20 class in your example, which means that the packets that match this rule, will not go into one of the child classes, but out on the line directly. Apparently that rule matched 2773 packets (direct packets stat of HTB qdisc) so this filter actually works. Regarding the handle 0x11 filter, this filter looks like it should work. However you do not show the iptables code where you mark packets to 0x11. Also make sure you&#039;re actually marking them as 0x11 and not 11. Also make sure that the marking rule actually does mark packets, by looking at the iptables counters. If you have an -j ACCEPT or RETURN somewhere it&#039;s possible that the packets that you want to mark, never actually reach your rule.</p><p>Some issues unrelated to your question:<br />- Your HTB rates look weird and are most likely not what you want. From my personal experience, it&#039;s best to set the rates so that parent class rate = sum of all children class rates. In your case this is 650kbit = 1kbit + 1kbit which does not match. Also, using the prio parameter is a last resort and does not do what most people expect it to do, as it doesn&#039;t give any priority to packets.<br />- When using SFQ qdiscs, keep in mind that SFQ has an insanely large default queue size of 128 packets. Since it wants to re-order packets, it has to have a queue of some sort, but the more packets that have to sit in a queue, you will get high delays in transmissions. The more SFQ qdiscs you use, the larger the total amount of queued packets will be, e.g. if you&#039;re using two independent SFQ qdiscs that means that there will be 256 packets stuck in a queue. In the early days you had to patch the kernel to make SFQ use smaller queues, but today you can simply pass a limit option to the tc command. I suggest you use SFQ only where necessary (where you don&#039;t mind lag) and limit the queue size to some small value like 8 or 16.</p><p>I use HTB, SFQ and PRIO myself and they&#039;re very nice schedulers, however, you won&#039;t get good results if you don&#039;t use the correct values. Same goes for all schedulers unfortunately... TBF/RED tend to choke connections when used incorrectly, HSFC won&#039;t perform well if you don&#039;t know how it works (some claim it&#039;s better than HTB, but I didn&#039;t get any satisfying results from it, which just means I don&#039;t know how to make this damn thing work the way I want it to), etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>following applies in case the interface on which you do the QoS is an interface with Masquerading or SNAT active, as is often the case with the wan interface that connects to internet or an adsl modem so that the outside world sees one IP address.<br />Masquerading and SNAT are done before the packages hit the processing by tc, and hence they have lost their original source address by the time you test them for their source address !<br />If that&#039;s your problem the solution is in not doing the filter command in tc using &#039;u32&#039; but to use &#039;fw&#039; and use the MARK target in the MANGLE table of iptables. Below are some code snippets; as they result from quick cut/paste from my scripts check carefully.<br />The priorities serve to prioritize classes at the same level; the higher class (lower number) will be guaranteed its minimum before looking at any other need of other classes at that level.

It mainly affects bandwidth borrowing / lending behaviour so it&#039;s only a hard prio if you give a class a close-to-zero rate and high ceil, so it has to borrow everything. Setting proper rates will give you a much finer level of control (e.g. class a 70% class B 30%) since the rates are also used for weighting when distributing extra bandwidth. You should try this approach first and add prio only later to see if it helps any.</p><p>HSFC is supposed to be stronger in this area, since you can work with both bandwidth and delay, but it doesn&#039;t work for me or rather I don&#039;t understand this scheduler well enough to make it work for me.</p>									</div>
