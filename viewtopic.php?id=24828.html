					<p>What is the platform you&#039;re using OpenWRT on? Is that a router or a full-blown x86 system?</p><p>OpenWRT is mostly optimized to be run on a specialized devices with a very limited resources. It is normal for such devices to only be equipped with 4Mb of flash thus having syslogd to write the messages into /var/log/messages would be undesirable. Default OpenWRT build includes busybox tiny versions of syslogd and klogd and both applets are by default configured to send logs only to the circular buffer you can read using logread busybox applet.</p><p>Syslogd gets started by /etc/init.d/boot script in the default OpenWRT installation. This script is not called directly. Rather the symlink inside /etc/rc.d/S??boot is used. The S01syslogd script you posted was probably incidentally installed by some package you added to your configuration. To determine the exact package you may use the following command sequence (change it to fit your needs):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@dir825NSAHome:~# ls -l /etc/rc.d/S10boot

Instead I had used to use syslog remote logging capability over the openvpn tunnel. So the setup I use is the bunch of openwrt boxes placed at different sites and reliably connected to the internet (typical setup is the wired pppoe connection as primary and USB WIMAX modem as the secondary) and one dedicated server machine having the openvpn server and syslog-ng installed. All logs of the working boxes are fetched by this dedicated server and being sorted to the different files using syslog-ng capabilities.</p><p>You should definitely take a look onto <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system">this wiki page</a> for the correct syntax of configuring busybox syslog on the recent openwrt builds. As for syslog-ng/syslog-ng3 - I&#039;m sure that the startup sctipt in these packages will automatically stop busybox syslogd/klogd before the execution of the ng/ng3 counterparts. Yet, you should test it before use :-).</p>									</div>
