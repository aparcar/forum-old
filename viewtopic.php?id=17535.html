					<p>I have a Ubuntu server that I would like to backup some directories on, to my USB HD connected to my Asus WL-500gP.</p><p>I was thinking of using rsync but I don&#039;t know how to set it up. I would like to use a auth-key instead of using plain password.</p><p>There is lot of guides but as I&#039;am not that good at linux and Openwrt have its limitation, I mean all apps are not available on Openwrt via opkg.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can set up public key authentication as described here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/DropbearPublicKeyAuthenticationHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/DropbearPublicK â€¦ ationHowto</a></p><p>Then, set up a cron script to rsync.&nbsp; If you want to rsync to a remote computer (using ssh) you do:<br />rsync -a /folder/to/backup/ root@192.168.1.1:/mnt/usb<br />Since you have public key authentication this won&#039;t ask you for your password so you can just put this in a cron script.</p><p>The way rsync works is it should only send the changed files.&nbsp; As long as you have a fast network this should be pretty quick (though it helps to have more ram/disk cache on your openwrt box.)</p><p>There&#039;s also a &quot;-v&quot; option for verbose--probably should use this while testing the script out.<br />Also check you got the slashes at the end of each path correct.&nbsp; I think if you put a slash at the end, rsync will not create a directory, but you might want to check the manpages or just try something.</p><p>Edit: forgot to mention that for rsync to work you need to have rsync on both computers... so you need to do &quot;opkg install rsync&quot; on openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phorn</strong> on 10 Nov 2008, 21:24)</p>
