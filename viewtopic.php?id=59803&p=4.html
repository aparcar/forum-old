Most routers do not have any real-time clock, so at the boot Openwrt uses the most recent timestamp of files in /etc as the approximation of the time and then launches ntpd to fetch the correct time from internet, but that may take a few seconds. With bad luck, the router starts from a time a few seconds earlier than the earlier reboot, and cron may make it to reboot again before ntpd gets the correct time from internet. You might read:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54227">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54227</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cron#periodic_reboot_of_a_router">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cron … f_a_router</a></p><p>consider this line for crontab:<br />0 3 * * 6 sleep 70 &amp;&amp; touch /etc/banner &amp;&amp; reboot</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a brief question regarding the following config option:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>adb_wanif =&gt; name of the logical wan interface (default: &#039;wan&#039;)</p></blockquote></div><p>On my router, wan is listed as:&nbsp; eth0.2</p><p>So I was just not sure if, by &quot;logical&quot; that is referring to the plain title of &quot;wan&quot; or the more technical name of &quot;eth0.2&quot; in my case.</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I apologize, but I have one other basic level question that I wanted to clarify.</p><p>I definitely want to make use of the pixel server option for using uhttpd to replace ads with transparent pixel which seems to be the default with your package which is great.&nbsp; But what I am curious about is if the default will work for my network setup.&nbsp; So far everything appears to be working appropriately, the adblock service has downloaded and prepared the default blocklists and running, but no ads are being blocked yet.&nbsp; So I am just troubleshooting that right now. My second question is regarding this option:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>adb_nullipv4 =&gt; IPv4 blackhole ip address (default: &#039;192.0.2.1&#039;)</p></blockquote></div><p>My OpenWrt is configured to 192.168.0.5 and so I see that, by default, adblock service has uhttpd listening/filtering on 192.0.2.1.&nbsp; Will the default work based on my setup?&nbsp; Or would I need to set the uhttpd setting (nullipv4) to something like 192.168.0.10?</p><p>Sorry for my basic questions.&nbsp; I am just trying to get a better understanding. Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WildByDesign</strong> on 17 Mar 2016, 16:56)</p>

The adblock uhttpd instance uses an ip address from the private &#039;TEST-NET-1&#039; subnet (192.0.2.1 / ::ffff:c000:0201) by default and all ad related domains will be redirected to this (pixelserver) ip.</p><p>To check if adblock works, please keep an eye on the adblock statistics ... after you&#039;ve visited some ad related sites run &#039;/etc/init.d/adblock start&#039; again and you should see something like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[...]

					<p>@dibdot&nbsp; Thank you, sir.&nbsp; I appreciate you taking your time to respond.</p><p>You did a great job of clarifying both of my questions and thanks to your detailed explanations, I now have a much better understanding of how to configure and how things work as well.&nbsp; Also, that is also a great testament to the way that you&#039;ve coded and designed this adblock package; very smart work.</p><p>Now, I was able to confirm that everything is working correctly now.&nbsp; I do have a follow-up question though, if you have a moment.&nbsp; Also, I know that you had suggested further questions to your email address, but I have a feeling that the scenario that I am about to inquire about may be beneficial to other users and therefore I figured that it might be best to ask my next question in this open forum so that the answers to follow may help others potentially.</p><p>First, just to confirm that my setup is functioning correctly:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Thu Mar 17 14:02:04 2016 user.notice adblock[7532] info : domain adblock processing started (1.0.0, 15.05.1, 17.03.2016 14:02:04)
