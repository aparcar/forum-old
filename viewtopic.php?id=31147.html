All supported adsl2+ ones are single band only. All supported dual band routers have no adsl2+. So your nearest thing would be combining an adsl2+ modem and a dual band router, changing one of the lan ports into an additional wan port (should be doable on all supported dual band routers).</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Jarrod Chesney wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hi, I have a DGND3700 and i want to run openwrt on it.<br />I understand that WIFI and/or ADSL won&#039;t work.</p><p>Can any of you help me out with :<br />1) Which method to put the firmware on with?<br />2) Which firmware to use<br />3) Where to get it from</p></blockquote></div><p>There is no firmware or support for it yet with OpenWrt.</p>									</div>
