					<p>TP-Link WR941ND V3.2 with blocked writing with firmware DD-WRT v24-sp2 (11/21/10) std - build 15778 for&nbsp; TP-Link TL-WR941ND v2/v3.<br />I didn&#039;t used it for few years because writing of any setting is impossible.<br />It can&#039;t save settings and can&#039;t write any update files to flash.</p><p>My question is is there some new firmware which would enable me an easy revert to stock firmware or to some newer DD-WRT or openwrt firmware.<br />Or I need to use USB to TTL uart to flash the firmware to stock or to some compatible which enables writing any settings.<br />If I must use ttl can I use some cheap CH340G, cp2102, FTDI or pl2303 or it must be Nokia ca-42?</p><p>If I need to short pins as shown on the picture (I&#039;m not allowed to post links)</p><p>should I leave shorten pins after I finish flashing the firmware or should I unshorten.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you are just completing the circuit so the serial data reaches the CPU.&nbsp; Several TP Link models require that sort of mod.</p><p>If you can boot up dd-wrt and access the filesystem, make a backup of your ART partition to your PC before you start flashing.&nbsp; You may need it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 10 May 2017, 00:04)</p>
