					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve read some posts from last year regarding using a Linksys WRTSL54GS and various USB Audio Cards to stream audio.&nbsp; I am new&#039;ish to OpenWRT, but understand how to flash and some linux basics.&nbsp; I am looking specifically for a Linksys recommendation because I have an unrelated application that already works on Linksys routers, and I don&#039;t want to change from what is currently supported.</p><p>Since the posts were from last year I wanted to know what is the current hardware recommendation for Linksys Routers and USB Audio (or are there other Audio solutions on Linksys?)?</p><p>What document/thread/howto will walk me through getting it to play audio via a usb sound card?</p><p>If the recommended router has a button on it can this somehow be used to cycle through say stream IP address 1 and stream IP address 2, and if possible additional streams?</p><p>Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Ron</p>									</div>
