					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;ve made build environment, make some config. After few hours the process finished without errors.</p><p>I suppose that root.ext4 file in&nbsp; /build_dir/linux-x86_generic/ is what i need. The question is how to use it? How to put it on the disk?</p><p>Probably there is somewhere info about that but I cant find it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I built an image for my Eee 701 using the generic combined X86 VM image, adding the necessary kernel modules from within the running VM, and then converting the VMDK to a raw img file using the qemu-img.exe program from the QEMU package. Then to install that on the 701 I did the following, which I suppose should also work for you:</p><p>1. create a bootable USB linux drive containing System Rescue CD 4.5.2 or later<br />2. copy the newly-built OpenWRT img file to a folder on that drive<br />3. boot the 701 using the USB drive until you get a command line<br />4. dd if=/path/to/my-new-eeepc-openwrt.img of=/dev/sda<br />5. startx and then run gparted<br />6. use gparted to expand sda2 into the free space on the disk<br />7. reboot</p><p>I discovered that the same image and procedure will work with an Eee 900 as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jrdld</strong> on 11 Jul 2015, 23:28)</p>

					<p>BTW, you can configure the Eee PC to run multiple VLAN&#039;s on the ethernet port. So if you have a switch with proper 802.1Q support (e.g. a Netgear Prosafe Plus), you can hook the Eee to a trunk port on that and have it act as a firewall between additional wired zones.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jrdld</strong> on 11 Jul 2015, 23:30)</p>
