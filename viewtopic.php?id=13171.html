					<p>I am having this exact same problem. I have uninstalled all unnecessary packages, but it still says the space is full. And because it is full the system is very unstable. I am constantly dropping my wireless and it is very annoying. XWRT ends up not responding either. Here are the packages I have installed. If someone could inform how to find out what is taking up so much space that would be great.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>base-files-brcm-2.4    10-9600

					<p>hi, </p><p>it looks like you have only 4MB flash and so your jffs-filesystem has only 1,3MB. if your Router should have 8MB flash you have to figure out whatÃ‚Â´s your problem, but if you donÃ‚Â´t have a WL-500G Premium, you have just 4MB and I doubt that you had plenty of space in whiterussian, I guess you had luck to have just enough space. <br />But you can install the packages on your usbstick if it is permanently connected.<br />you have two options, you can put your root-filesystem on the usbstick, or you just install new packages on it.<br />check out <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto</a> for more info.</p>									</div>

					<p>That seems to be the case still. I&#039;m at 7.09 and I reached 100% and I can&#039;t remove files, I can&#039;t uninstall packages. I get Segmentation faults if I try and remove files by hand it gives an error and then when I try to interface with those inodes things hang until I reboot the router.</p><p>It seems the only hope is reflashing or cleaning the jffs partition through a mtd -r erase rootfs_data (which of course destroys any local changes made since original flash).</p>									</div>
