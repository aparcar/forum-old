					<p>Hi,</p><p>Installed OpenWRT yesterday, because i found that stock firmware dropped TCP-Connections after receiving DHCP responses from ISP every ~ hour.</p><p>About my experience with OpenWRT on DIR-645 so far:</p><p>I was affected by the settings not saving bug, described in viewtopic.php?id=64336 (cannot post links, sorry)<br />Maybe you want to note the Fix (viewtopic.php?pid=321106#p321106 ) in the wiki.</p><p>I seem to be not affected by the Wifi dropping, described in some forum posts I found. Wifi adapter settings are unchanged, except for encryption.</p><p>LAN throughput lacks a bit behind stock firmware (930 vs. 970 MBit/s)</p><p>So far: great job and a big thank you for OpenWRT on DIR-645!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Mike,</p><p>WiFi seems stable so far, I have 4 devices connected without problems.<br />The only configuration I modified was the SSID and encryption settings, I left coutrycode etc. unchanged.</p><p>I ran a iperf speedtest against a LAN-connected computer for almost 24h with a pretty constant bitrate of about 20Mbit/s. I noticed the graph in LuCI shows a Phy-Rate, that has nothing to do with the actual throughput. It sometimes shows rates down as 5Mbit/s whereas the measured throughput did not change.</p><p>Did your Wifi work with stock firmware?</p><p>I just remember: a friend of mine told me, that with his router he had Wifi problems because of the power supply.</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Mike,</p><p>no errors in my syslog. My firewall setup is just the default one (Reject on WAN). the only thing i modified after installing was one port forwarding, installed a dyndns-client and modified WiFi SSID and set encryption like it was before(WPA2 PSK (CCMP) as with stock).</p><p>When you used it as access-point, did you connect your LAN to the WAN-Port?</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>

					<p>I think this is the ticket for the problem you described: dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12313<br />Seems like the driver has issues with some chip revisions. my kernel log says </p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp;14.900000] ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00_set_rt: Info - RT chipset 3883, rev 0400 detected<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;14.920000] ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00_set_rf: Info - RF chipset 3853 detected</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I&#039;ve got exactly this error and I can see this in a few other tickets which are years ago. But no solution. That&#039;s a message of my syslog:</p><p>phy0: rt2x00queue_write_tx_frame: Error - Dropping frame due to full tx queue 2</p><p>Br, Mike</p>									</div>
