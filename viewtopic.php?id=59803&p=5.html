Than it&#039;s a not supported configuration, you can&#039;t use this package ... for further information look <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/adblock/files#background">here</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Didot! I just did a new openwrt install on the router, just to be sure I&#039;m starting from scratch. I have a lan and wan interface now, but adblock is not showing up in the software list. I guess I have to add the repo somewhere, was trying to figure that out now.</p>									</div>
