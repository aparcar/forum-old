					<p>Been running some load tests today. What got me started on the tests, was CPU always seemed to range between 2% - 4% no matter what I was doing.</p><p>I even ran a test involving 5 torrents running at the same time with nearly a 1k peers, and processor was just pretty much sitting idle (maybe 2%) with a load of 0.1</p><p>My second load test was a little more harsh. The script below will run a loop, causing any CPU to instantaneously run at 100% </p><p>#!/bin/sh<br />for i in 1 2 3 4; do while : ; do : ; done &amp; done </p><p>The script after about 2 minutes caused a load of 4.5 and processor utilization (according to top) of nearly 80%. My homegrown script showed utilization at 98%. </p><p>Anyhow, what did these tests prove? The router&#039;s hardware is completely over-kill for just about any home use. Here&#039;s the thing... Why in the heck would Liksys (Belkin), want to cripple the software so much?

There have been 2 different times that I have to do the triple boot and both times it worked. *Knocking on wood* I have a nice new usb&gt;ttl cable still in it&#039;s bag...Just the way I like it.&lt;G&gt;<br />Not trying to be a smart a** just saying it has worked for me so far.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yup same here..no issues flashing various openwrt revision that I build my self every now and then. Just have to keep in mind that between openwrt builds you have to flash the sysupgrade and not the full image.&nbsp; Full images are to go from oem fw to openwrt</p>									</div>

Your examples have two untagged VLANs going to the same CPU port (6). At least one needs to be tagged, and a corresponding eth1.X interface must be created.

I have two friends that also run this router and we all experience problems of some sort. With all due respect to all the on-going work, this is the most unstable router we&#039;ve ever run. At the very least a reboot is somewheres in the future. Trunk is seemingly more unstable as of late.</p></blockquote></div><p>We can say that about the stock Linksys firmware, that likes to lock up, requiring a reboot, as well.</p>									</div>
