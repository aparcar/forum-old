					<p>I googled on some interesting RB, based on some PowerPC 405 @ 266 MHz with 2 miniPCI cards. They ship it with OpenWRT preinstalled. So, if I can compile myself a Quagga 0.99.11 package for it, it&#039;s all I need for 69 Euro + VAT + Shipping.</p><p><a href="http://shop.openrb.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=18&amp;products_id=127">http://shop.openrb.com/index.php?main_p â€¦ cts_id=127</a></p><p>So, my question is... has someone seen this working?</p><p>I ask because I spent a lot of time making a Mikrotik RouterBoard 600 (also Power PC, but @ 400MHz) with no success (OpenWRT or Debian - problems with the patch Mikrotik released and RTC).</p><p>Beside that, if anyone knows a cheaper OpenWRT solution for routing wireless links, I&#039;ll take the advice.</p><p>Thx</p>									</div>
