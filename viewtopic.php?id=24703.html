					<p>Dear people of this forum, </p><p>I have a pretty old <strong>Compex NP-26G</strong> router, which I would like to give a second life as a fileserver.<br/>A friend of mine brought the concept of OpenWRT to my attention, and I would like to enjoy the benefits of running it on my router.</p><p>Over a year ago, I attempted to flash the router (through TFTP) to use OpenWRT, but after the flash the router stopped working.<br/>I then proceeded to reinstall the vendor firmware and continued to use the router as such.<br/>I lent it to a friend for a while, and after another year it is back in my posession.</p><p>I now see some new versions have been released, and I would like to give it a second shot.</p><p>Now on to the problem I am facing: I cannot figure out what version I should use (with a reasonable chance of succes). <br/>I have spent some time searching the Wiki, documentation and forum to find this out, but so far to no avail.</p><p>In an attempt to gain more information to aid me in this search, I tried to look around on the net to find out what hardware is present in my router.<br/>According to some reviews it contains the PRISM GT chipset. Based on this information I still couldn&#039;t find a build, so I decided to screw it open.</p><p>The router casing contains a circuit board, combined with a PCMCIA card as a wireless transmitter (to my surprise).<br/>Unfortunately seeing the board still did not give me enough insight into what version I could use.</p><p>To sum up what I learned so far:<br/>- possible use of PRISM GT chipset<br/>- circuit board has a <em>Samsung ARM0348 S3C2510A01 KR771A</em> chip on it<br/>- the PCMCIA card is a <em>Compex iWavePort WL54G</em> (FCC: IXMCBGIN01)<br/>- somewhere I found the amount of flash ram and memory, I seem to recall it is 2MB and 8MB, maybe even 4/8</p><p>Can anyone tell me<br/>- if I can use OpenWRT ?<br/>- <strong>which version</strong> I should use ?</p><p>Thanks a lot for reading, and even more thanks if you can provide me with an answer.<br/>If necessary I can post pictures of the circuit board / cardbus card to assist in identifying other components or specifications.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>GeKKo</p>									</div>
