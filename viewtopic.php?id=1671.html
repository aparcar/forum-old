					<p>Greetings,</p><p>I just flashed a WRT54G, label on the back says it is a v2.0.<br />I used the latest experimental binaries, and after flashing I&#039;m having two problems.</p><p>&gt;&gt; First, the free space is only 2MB. Wasn&#039;t it supposed to be 4MB?</p><p>Second, nano isn&#039;t working well. It is being installed to /opt/bin, a directory that is not on PATH; I believe it would be better if it was placed in /usr/(s)bin. Also, it corrupts the files when saving them. If I create and save a file with:</p><p>test<br />test</p><p>It saves something like:</p><p>ttesttest</p><p>Oh, and vi sucks. But you all know that already :)</p><p>Regards,<br />Andre</p>									</div>

					<p>As explained by mbm during a chat session, experimental squashfs binaries have about 2MB left over for jffs.&nbsp; Either flash with the jffs2 firmware, or consider storing compressed binaries on jffs and decompressing them to the ramfs during startup - that&#039;s a quick way to save some space...&nbsp; And vim is cool man <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Actually jffs2 (and for that matter squahfs) both use compression when storing the files, compressing the files yourself won&#039;t save you any space. If anything, it&#039;ll use up more ram just because you&#039;d constantly have an uncompressed version of the file in /tmp.</p><p>Some hints on space -<br />- the wrt54gs (speedbooster) models have 8M of flash vs the normal 4M, this gives you extra room for your applications<br />- if you like to modify the hardware, the sd card mod is a good way to gain extra storage<br />- if you don&#039;t like hardware modifications try using nfs or cifs (samba/windows file shares).<br />- squashfs gets slightly better compression than jffs2; if you know you need a certain set of applications compile the firmware yourself with the applications on squashfs. You just won&#039;t be able to edit squashfs without reflashing the firmware.<br />- if you do install with squahfs you can later switch to jffs2 by copying everything from squashfs to jffs2 and running &#039;jffs2root --move&#039; (this requires the latest version to work correctly)<br />- compile all your applications with the -Os gcc flag to produce smaller binaries<br />- use sstrip (yes, two s&#039;s) to further reduce the size of binaries<br />The files included with openwrt have already gone through the last two steps</p>									</div>

					<p>Does the jffs2root --move process work on the latest experimental?&nbsp; Like, should I just cp -aRv /rom / and run jffs2root --move, and it would be as if I had installed the jffs2 binary to begin with?&nbsp; That&#039;s very clever.&nbsp; What&#039;s it do, simply change some magic bits and relocate jffs2 to the squashfs&#039;s old location in nvram?&nbsp; That&#039;s very handy.&nbsp; I&#039;m still trying to understand the logical layout of the flash drive.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s something like [bootloader - 64k][&lt;kernel&gt;&lt;squashfs&gt; -2M ][jffs2- ~2M][nvram - 16k] ?</p>									</div>
