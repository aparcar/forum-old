					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve checked that entropy level is 131 just after boot</p><p>I&#039;ve compiled rng-tools for Backfire&nbsp; because of issue of <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9631">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9631</a> </p><br /><p>The weird thing is even after rngd is running I took a look&nbsp; &nbsp;/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail and is more than 3000 despite of that when wifi is up again complains about &quot;Not enough entropy...&quot;</p><p>I mean:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>random: Only 18/20 bytes of strong random data available from /dev/random
random: Not enough entropy pool available for secure operations
WPA: Not enough entropy in random pool for secure operations - update keys later when the first station connects</code></pre></div><p>Why???</p><p>Sorry for asking a second question what does mean &quot;update keys&quot; ? Does it mean restart wifi?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
