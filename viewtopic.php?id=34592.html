					<p>Just when client scanning,not linking to my router.<br />I want to capture wifi client’s infomation when he scanning the network,just when he scanning ,not connecting.I use the horst (<a href="http://br1.einfach.org/tech/horst/">http://br1.einfach.org/tech/horst/</a>).Everything is ok ,except the signal level.Signal level and the noise is always 0,and the snr is always 95.<br />It seems that horst not support my wifi driver.My router is Alcatel-Sbell RG100A-A,with a BCM6358 CPU.</p><p>Can anyone give me some advice about how to do this.</p>									</div>

					<p>I read from <a href="http://br1.einfach.org/tech/horst/,it">http://br1.einfach.org/tech/horst/,it</a> says :<br />===========<br />again, the reason for this is in the ath9k driver and mac80211 layer of the<br />linux networking stack. the main developers of mac80211 have decided some time<br />ago that they don’t care about signal and noise values and have removed the<br />corresponding (and well working) code. i and some others have protested, but<br />there was not enough demand for reporting signal and noise on a per-packet<br />basis. if you care about it, please ask on the linux-wireless mailinglist,<br />it’s easy enough to add the code again.<br />==============<br />It seems some code may be done the driver.Can anybody give me some advice?</p>									</div>
