					<p>Hello all / devs</p><p>The last snapshot of trunk to download on openwrt downloads site is dated 27-oct-2011 and seems to be from attitude adjustment / trunk r28601.</p><p>I need the .config file used to build that. It is not for download on the site (as with backfire and earlier versions, that have the config file available).</p><p>I would just like to customize packages on that snapshot build, but there is also no image generator for that to download. When I wanted to build one, I missed the .config. I took the one from backfire-10.03.1-rc6 and ran a oldconfig, choosing defaults on the newer options and ended up with a sucessfull compilation, but there is something wrong still because I get strange errors for example when starting qos-scripts (missing kernel modules) that do not occour if I use the downloaded binary (snapshot).</p><p>The developers probably changed more things on the config than what I did. Is it possible to someone from the development team to put it there for download as well? I would ask for the image generator itself, but that I can build if I have the config.</p><p>I&#039;m specifically interested on the ar71xx / TL-MD3220v1 config file for the r28601 or near it.</p><p>Thank you!<br />Andre</p>									</div>
