					<p>Openwrt ports to the Linksys WRT54G3G box, which has a PCMCIA slot, to plug in a Vodafone 3G card.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not been able to get the modem working, but am confident it will work, as the linksys code is linux based</p><p>I&#039;m prepared to pay a resonable sum to someone to get this to work for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;The resulting code / methodolgys would of course be made avialble back to the openwrt community.</p><p>Please let me know if youre interested and what it is worth to you to make it work.</p>									</div>
