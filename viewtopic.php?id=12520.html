					<p>Hello,</p><p>Recently UPX got support for MIPS binaries and could be used with OpenWRT. </p><p>See <br /><a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=352331&amp;aid=1689655&amp;group_id=2331">https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=d â€¦ up_id=2331</a></p><p>for the feature request (closed now).</p><p>What do you think about this? Could it be used to pack executables in order to save more space on the routers? How about delivering packages with binaries already processed by upx ? ( I know it&#039;s a little too soon for such a step - upx still needs to prove it&#039;s stability on this platform - but just as a thought..)</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>The filesystem is already compressed. Compressing the binaries with UPX as well would make things slower without any significant size decrease.</p>									</div>
