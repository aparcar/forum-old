					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to use ImageBuilder to build a cjdns/802.11s based meshbox for a localmesh I&#039;d like to start building out in Ireland, for fun. I&#039;m using a mix of hardware for this but the prototype is a TP-Link TL-WR841Nv7 because it&#039;s well supported in OpenWRT but represents a pretty low baseline for hardware; anything that&#039;ll fit on its 4MB chip will probably fit on any reasonable OpenWRT meshbox to be added later.</p><p>When I found I couldn&#039;t install the needed packages with opkg because of space constraints, and couldn&#039;t uninstall built-in packages to recover space, I decided to try ImageBuilder. So far it&#039;s awesome; really fast, near-zeroconfig, and easy to use.</p><p>However, for reasons unknown to me, the emitted images in /bin after use do not include *sysupgrade.bin images, so I am not sure how to use them to upgrade my hardware. When I use `sysupgrade -T &lt;image&gt;` it reports the openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs image file is invalid.</p><p>Other people using ImageBuilder on similar hardware do get the sysupgrade image as expected.</p><p>This is deep Makefile magic; I&#039;ll continue exploring, but if anyone has an answer that&#039;d help accelerate the desired outcome I&#039;d be very grateful. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hey stas2z, thanks for the quick reply.</p><p>So, do you mean that if the package list is bigger than the expected flash can contain, it successfully builds system images but quietly doesn&#039;t build sysupgrade images? So, if I trim things down I might get the image I&#039;m looking for, but I&#039;ll only know if it builds correctly? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

When I build a vanilla image it&#039;s fine.</p><p>I assumed that if there were fatal errors, that make would return an error code; my shell&#039;s set up to colourise when things break, so I saw &quot;green&quot; and thought &quot;everything&#039;s fine, where&#039;s my image?&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Anyways, I had to sacrifice luci and ppp but I got wpad-mes and authsae to fit, but no CJDNS; the 4MB routers will have to be &quot;dumb pipes&quot; in whatever setup I put together, I think.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>just a few tips to fit your packages:<br />0. use buildroot to build image, not imagebuilder<br />1. switch to the older Barrier Breaker release as it smaller<br />2. disable gdb and any other debug features in the config<br />3. use sstrip<br />4. remove ipv6 support if it&#039;s not necessary in yr setup (disable it in the configuration)</p><p>In case of luci preinstallation:<br />5. use minify luci source option<br />6. use special compilers to compact js/html/css files of yr packages</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 16 Dec 2015, 16:33)</p>
