					<p>Hello,</p><p>i installed the kamikaze branch on my WRT150N including the X-WRT extension, there was no problem the last few days. Now i reconfigured my wireless settings, and after this the configure process started but the router hangs up. After reboot, there is no way to log in. I can&#039;t access the router configuratio Interface with the old IP or the factory default (192.168.1.1). I&#039;ve tried to log on via ssh, but it says, there is no client with this IP.<br />If plugged my laptop to the router, there is a dhcp process, and laptop become a IP in this format: 169.254.221.218.</p><p>Now the question. Is there a way, to reset all configuration process in the openwrt firmware, or a way to log on, because i don&#039;t know the IP of the router...</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>That IP is a IPv4-APIPA IP. Means: DHCP is not running.</p>									</div>
