					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have been trying to get OpenWrt working on a WAG354Gv2 without any success. I&#039;ve tried precompiled versions found on the net and have just tried compiling my own, again with no joy.</p><p>I can flash the unit with the office Linksys FW and with Neptune354 fine.</p><p>I&#039;ve googled, read the troubleshooting wiki, read the wiki, found people who have succeeded (possibly on v1) and people who have failed.</p><p>One I power up, the power led goes red and the four port leds go green. Then the four port leds go off, the power led starts flashing and port 1 led goes green.</p><p>Unfortunately I have no access to serial to get any more details.</p><p>When compiling I got the source from &quot;svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/8.09&quot; and followed the instructions from <a href="http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Compile_Kamikaze_with_Webif%5E2">http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Compile â€¦ _Webif%5E2</a>.</p><p>Other then selecting ar7, is there anything in particular I need to include when compiling?</p><p>Is there any particular image to use, squashfs, jff2-64k or jff2-128k?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, please have a look at my post <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19247">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19247</a>. I&#039;ve built the firmware successfully with an old trunk version. it seems that in the 8.09 version, it is unable to boot wag354g v2 due to some hardware driver issues. And JFYI, the wireless does not work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Harry1985. Got r11325 and compiled it up and apart from the LED going nuts, I can at least telnet onto it. Don&#039;t need the wireless so thats not a problem.</p><p>Now need to work out what I need to connect to ADSL and then allow it to forward PPTP.</p><p>Anyone wanting to know how to get r11325, use the following command:</p><p>svn co -r 11325 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/8.09 r11325</p><p>puts it into directory r11325. Note the info on the web I found for the svn was out of date.</p><p>Got a couple of errors during make but didn&#039;t seem to cause a problem:</p><p>Ignoring feed &#039;packages&#039; - index missing</p><p>WARNING: No feed for package &#039;haserl&#039; found, maybe it&#039;s already part of the standard packages?<br />Ditto for coova-chilli, batmand, olsrd, olsrd-mod-dyn-gw, olsrd-mod-httpinfo, olsrd-mod-nameservice, olsrd-mod-secure.</p>									</div>
