I would really like to change over to English</p></blockquote></div><p>Here comes, just did this today.</p><p>First of all, thanks to lofranks, jvvh5897, Ccowap etc. for great work.</p><p>1. Download the &quot;fixed&quot; English hardware from <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/za7z3b2793aik82/wr702nv1-en-up.bin">http://www.mediafire.com/download/za7z3 … -en-up.bin</a><br />2. Download suitable tftp server. I used the 64-bit version of tftpd from <a href="http://tftpd32.jounin.net/">http://tftpd32.jounin.net/</a><br />3. Temporarily turn off your firewall if you are using ZoneAlarm (don&#039;t know about other firewalls). If you don&#039;t do this you will get 1800X error from the WT702n :-)<br />4. Turn off wireless on your computer and connect with cable to the WR702n. After a while you should be setup with IP address 192.168.1.100 and 255.255.255.0 netmask. If not you can setup these manually.<br />5. Start tftp server and set the base directory to be where the .bin-file downloaded in step 1 is. In tftpd you do this by clicking settings, then selecting TFTP-tab and browsing to the directory.<br />6. Point your web browser to 192.168.1.253, you get a login screen, type admin and hit enter<br />7. On the menu on the left side of the screen click on &quot;系統工具” (System tool), then select “韌體升級” (Firmware Upgrade)<br />8. On the next screen you will have place for filename and tftp server address. Set filename to wr702nv1-en-up.bin (which you downloaded in step 1) and address to 192.168.1.100 (which is the IP address assigned to your computer).<br />9. Below these are two boxes, click the one on the left (don&#039;t have the Chinese characters as I&#039;ve changed to English by now), then click OK.<br />10. There will be a counter as the file is loaded, you will also see progress in the tftpd main screen. If there is an error you will get a Chinese warning page with error code like 18000, 18001, 18005 etc. If you get this Google translator is your friend. On mine I got error code 18005 when trying to upgrade to incompatible English hardware and error 18000 before I stopped ZoneAlarm. <br />11. Wait until the device reboots, then just to be safe another few minutes. If nothing happens I would play it safe and wait at least 15 minutes before trying a manual reboot.<br />12. Now the 702n IP address has changed, your computer should automatically get a new address is the 192.168.0.xxx range.<br />13. Turn on your firewall and point your browser to 192.168.0.254, you will get login screen, both username and password are admin.</p><p>Hope this helps and I didn&#039;t forget anything important. Let me know if I did and I&#039;ll edit the post.</p><p>And if someone does this please copy the Chinese characters on the box to click on step 9 &amp; post here on the board or message directly to me.</p><p>Edit Dec-12, 2013: items 10, 11</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>motojapi</strong> on 12 Dec 2013, 18:25)</p>

					<p>I tried to follow the instructions as described above. It was partly successful but the device wouldn&#039;t reboot. I waited a good 15-20 minutes before I pulled the power supply to the device and then re powered it, but it started asking me for a network passcode. I tried the previous one before flashing the device but unfortunately it did not work. I reset the device like 5 times now with absolutely no luck. The device is alright and the wifi signal is available and all but I need the network password to connect to it. I&#039;d really be thankful if you could suggest me some solution to get this device working again.</p><p>I noticed that when I reset the device the led flashes 3 times and then later it glows and then it stops for a brief moment and then glows back again.</p><p>Update: I connected locally through lan and I could change the settings.

					<p>registered today because of this topic. i too have this tplink wr702n with chinese fw. i don&#039;t have rj45 cable as of the moment so i can&#039;t flash mine today.</p><p>anyway since the topic is about modifying firmware, may i ask something about this? here in the Philippines, Globe (a network provider here) started distributing huawei b593s-22 lte modems for their subscribers. the problem is that their modems are network-locked and are installed with globe fw. network-locked units aren&#039;t an issue because the modem is unlockable via huawei new algo unlocker. one thing that annoys us is the gui (it&#039;s globe and not the default huawei). i already found the universal fw for my modem but the problem is that it won&#039;t accept cross-flashing like the wr702n chinese fw. is it possible to modify the universal fw and faking it to be a globe fw so that i can install it on my modem? i have no knowledge in hex editing but willing to learn. please help. thanks in advance!</p><p>edit: successfully changed two wr702n fw using mojotapi&#039;s post as guide. after that, i upgraded it&#039;s fw into tp-link&#039;s official english fw. it&#039;s like i bought an english wr702n now! thanks a lot mojotapi for the procedure! and thanks to all the people involved in editing the fw to make it useable on our chinese fw wr702n.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paranoia_rebirth</strong> on 14 May 2014, 17:00)</p>
