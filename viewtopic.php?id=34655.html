					<p>Thanks for the reply, I read up a little more and I&#039;m still having trouble but I think I have a possible solution, hopefully someone here can tell me if it will work and if so what I&#039;m doing wrong.</p><p>I want to have NoDogSplash and the website on the router.&nbsp; The problem I am having is that Nodogsplash is running on 192.168.1.1:2050.&nbsp; When I join the router it works as advertised.&nbsp; My uhttpd server is hosted on 192.168.1.1:80. </p><p> I have the RedirectURL in Nodogsplash.config setup to send me to my uhttpd server (192.168.1.1:80).&nbsp; I believe this is impossible the way I currently have it setup because I can&#039;t redirect to the same subnet.</p><p>So I think I can still do this, I just need to create a virtual lan on the router so I can have two subnets.&nbsp; I have one at 192.168.1.1 and another on 192.168.2.1.</p><p>There are a ton of how to&#039;s but I can&#039;t quite get it to work.&nbsp; Everytime I try to start uhttpd it says it can&#039;t find a port to bind to.&nbsp; Disclaimer: I am a noob and I am really feeling my way through this! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>*****/etc/config/network********</p><br /><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.3.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.2.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</p><br /><p>config &#039;switch&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;name&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;reset&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;enable_vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option &#039;enable_vlan&#039; &#039;2&#039;</p><br /><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;</p><p>*****************************</p><p>The &#039;switch&#039; and &#039;switch_vlan&#039; sections have me confused.&nbsp; I have tried trial and error but sooner or later I lock myself out of my router and have to start from scratch again.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>@dirkdiggler<br />I also have a stubborn nodogsplash. The initial install worked when the wired Wan was the gateway, when i switched to wireless wan i seem to have broken it, but i also cant seem to revert it back.&nbsp; And being new to this i probably look in all the wrong places..., and perhaps&nbsp; misunderstand a few crucial things?&nbsp; not sure..</p><p>I&#039;m using CCrc2 firmware, what version do you use?</p><p>I have the same thing in mind as you (see my topic on this <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59087)">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59087)</a></p><p>I have got the website running from USB stick. <br />a alias IP 192.168.1.253 and uhttpd configures as webserver on this IP and pointing to the www/index.html thats sitting on the USB stick <br />see my main tread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58594">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58594</a> I hope that can help you</p><p>I&#039;ll subscribe to this topic, and hope i gain more insight in nodogsplash.&nbsp; (i&#039;m also noob)</p><p>The nodogsplash wiki is not very consistent it seems to be covering two different situations.&nbsp; One where the wifi network is named &#039;NoDogSplash&#039; and the other where it is named &#039;wifi&#039;&nbsp; but both only seem to explain half-something?&nbsp; <br />It would be nice if there was a more straight forward explanation of how nodogsplash really works, a step by step walktrough that shows what nodogsplashs does, why and how.&nbsp; </p><p>You seem to be doing things different then me when it comes to the IP adresses. I&#039;ll have a better look at that.<br />I hope the nodogexperts can point us in the right direction. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>@sajjadhalai<br />do you have your settings posted somewhere?<br />W ould like to compare them to what i have, that might clear up something for me...<br />Do you use uhttpd to serve the https?</p>									</div>
