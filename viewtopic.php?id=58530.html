					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;d like to connect two OpenWRT routers via cable in order to extend the range of my WiFi network. Both routers are TP-LINK TL-WR842ND, however one is 12.09 and the other one 14.07.</p><p>I have disabled DHCP on the &#039;slave&#039; router and deleted the &#039;WAN&#039; interface. I have configured &#039;LAN&#039; of the &#039;master&#039; router with static IP of 192.168.2.1 and &#039;LAN&#039; of the slave router as &#039;static&#039; with IP 192.168.2.2. Then I connect LAN port 1 of the slave to LAN port 4 of the master. And here is the problem: the link is unstable, it comes up and goes down again, every 3-5 seconds.</p><p>Syslog doesn&#039;t tell me much more than that the link is down and up again, but nothing about the reason. I tried different cables and different LAN ports on both routers, no change. BTW: am I supposed to use a crossover cable when connecting two routers this way? I tried and it made no difference, so I assume at least these routers support auto MDI-X?</p><p>For the few seconds that the link is up, there is actually traffic going through, at least ping.</p>									</div>

					<p>With the level of detail you have included it&#039;s hard to identify the issue, however I have this working on CC RC2.</p><p>It sounds like you are trying to create a &quot;Dumb AP&quot;.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58313">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58313</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a></p><p>It is not necessary to change anything having to do with the WAN on the Dumb AP.&nbsp; Actually leaving it makes it easier to revert to a &quot;Router&quot; if needed.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty much change the IP and disable DHCP all in one window.</p>									</div>
