					<p>Hello! I&#039;m getting only ~20Mbps through wireless with a TP-Link TL-WR841ND v7 running OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07. If I understand right, the router specs says it should reach 300Mbps:<br /><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-9_TL-WR841ND.html#specifications">http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/deta â€¦ ifications</a><br />I would be glad with ~60Mbps, because that is my broadband limit.</p><p>Using ethernet and a Internet speed test I get ~60Mbps, using wireless and the same speed test only ~20Mbps.</p><p>Doing the speed test between two boxes using wireless (used dd &amp; nc) it goes to ~10Mbps.</p><p>I have another router here (different brand and with factory firmware) and it reaches ~40Mbps. So I don&#039;t think the problem is noise or my box. At least not ALL the problem...</p><p>/etc/config/wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>Do your devices support 300 MBps? Run &quot;iw dev&quot; via ssh or telnet. If it says 40 MHz then your router works with HT40, but the client side is the problem. As for the tx power, use jow&#039;s reghack and set your country to US- it will allow up to 23 dBm -which is the highest possible, tough FCC claims this router can do 27 dBm, some people somehow managed to do it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>user5077</strong> on 15 Dec 2015, 13:25)</p>
