					<p>I just installed openwrt on my wrt54g v2.2.&nbsp; It has the experimental version on it.&nbsp; I turned on boot wait and I also set the wan_hwaddr to my PCs mac address because my cable ISP requires it.&nbsp; I did a ifconfig in the router and it shows that the wan interface has been setup properly.&nbsp; When I use DHCP on my PC interface it sets the dns server as 192.168.1.1 but nothing will resolve.&nbsp; How do I get DHCP to propigate the DNS servers that the ISP sent to the wan interface to the local DHCP?</p>									</div>

					<p>dnsmasq will feed out it&#039;s own ip address as the dns server (usually 192.168.1.1) and will create a proxy dns server. dnsmasq itself uses resolv.conf which should have been setup by the dhcp from the wan.</p>									</div>
