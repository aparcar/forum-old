					<p>Hi, <br />I got a new router for free from Amazon and thought I&#039;d design my network as follows:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/j9a9m1.png" alt="My Network Diagram!" /></span></p><p>Straight Lines are LAN Cable Connections <br />Dashed Lines are WIFI Connections</p><p>Dir615 Router is of older version and therefore can&#039;t be modded with OpenWRT or DDWRT. But it serves as an excellent Access Point , which I&#039;m currently using. There is <span class="bbu"><strong>no WDS support</strong></span></p><p>I need the OpenWRT router to connect as a Client mode/Pseudo Mode/Repeater Mode, to access internet and also to access the <span class="bbu">MediaServer <strong>broadcast</strong></span>. I&#039;m guessing there is some IGMP Proxying required , something like <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/udp_multicast"> UDP Multicast</a></p><p>I also need the OpenWRT Router to work as a <span class="bbu">standalone</span> in case there is no connection to AccessPoint1. That is why I kept it in the <span class="bbu">192.168.100.0 subnet</span>. This is required because, even if there is no internet or AccessPoint1, I want to connect my smartphone or tablet to connect to the TV and use it as a local mediaserver or Remote control.</p><p>Is this design possible? Which Mode is best suited in OpenWRT for this design? Can OpenWRT be configured to work as a standalone Accesspoint with 192.168.100.0/24 subnet with a link(can I say bridge here?) to the DLink Router with 192.168.1.0/24 and also have multicast forwarding? </p><p>Thanks for the help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
