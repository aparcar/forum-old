					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I recently installed whiterussian .9 and installed a bunch of php5 packages and lighttpd packs as well.&nbsp; I have a usb flash stick in the back of this router acting as its hard drive.&nbsp; I realized after doing all this and setting up the router that there seems to be severe incompatibility issues here.&nbsp; For instance, when attempting to execute a lighttpd .conf file (bringing a vhost up), it tells me that libcrypto.so.0.9.7 is not found.&nbsp; Well, apparently it&#039;s nowhere to be found.&nbsp; I have 9.8 in my /lib directory, but that&#039;s obviously not 0.9.7</p><p>So, here&#039;s a spitout of what I&#039;m getting:</p><p>root@sea_test:/mnt/disc0_1/mgr/etc/lighttpd# lighttpd -f lighttpd.conf<br />root@sea_test:/mnt/disc0_1/mgr/etc/lighttpd# /mgr/usr/sbin/php: can&#039;t load library &#039;libz.so.1&#039;<br />1999-12-31 16:08:22: (mod_fastcgi.c.1048) the fastcgi-backend /mgr/usr/sbin/php failed to start: <br />1999-12-31 16:08:22: (mod_fastcgi.c.1052) child exited with status 16 /mgr/usr/sbin/php <br />1999-12-31 16:08:22: (mod_fastcgi.c.1055) if you try do run PHP as FastCGI backend make sure you use the FastCGI enabled version.<br />You can find out if it is the right one by executing &#039;php -v&#039; and it should display &#039;(cgi-fcgi)&#039; in the output, NOT (cgi) NOR (cli)<br />For more information check <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/documentation/fastcgi.html#preparing-php-as-a-fastcgi-program">http://www.lighttpd.net/documentation/f … gi-program</a> <br />1999-12-31 16:08:22: (mod_fastcgi.c.1060) If this is PHP on Gentoo add fastcgi to the USE flags <br />1999-12-31 16:08:22: (mod_fastcgi.c.1356) [ERROR]: spawning fcgi failed. <br />1999-12-31 16:08:22: (server.c.834) Configuration of plugins failed. Going down.</p><br /><p>I had attempted to do an ipkg upgrade command which apparently destroyed my router momentarily, until I was able to log in via the web interface (yes the ipkg upgrade command changed my root password) and change the pass back.&nbsp; After ssh&#039;ing back in I see that most of my ipkg packs have been deleted or are missing.&nbsp; What the f*** just happened, right? In any case, I ran my scripts and re-installed the packages I needed and have gotten back to where I was (hopefully with no more packages missing).&nbsp; Which brings me to the spitout above.&nbsp; </p><p>How can I remedy the problem php is having (not finding libz.so.1)? If I run :</p><p>root@sea_test:/mnt/disc0_1/mgr/etc/lighttpd# lighttpd -D -f lighttpd.conf<br />/mgr/usr/sbin/php: can&#039;t load library &#039;libz.so.1&#039;<br />1999-12-31 16:21:17: (mod_fastcgi.c.1048) the fastcgi-backend /mgr/usr/sbin/php failed to start: <br />1999-12-31 16:21:17: (mod_fastcgi.c.1052) child exited with status 16 /mgr/usr/sbin/php <br />1999-12-31 16:21:17: (mod_fastcgi.c.1055) if you try do run PHP as FastCGI backend make sure you use the FastCGI enabled version.<br />You can find out if it is the right one by executing &#039;php -v&#039; and it should display &#039;(cgi-fcgi)&#039; in the output, NOT (cgi) NOR (cli)<br />For more information check <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/documentation/fastcgi.html#preparing-php-as-a-fastcgi-program">http://www.lighttpd.net/documentation/f … gi-program</a> <br />1999-12-31 16:21:17: (mod_fastcgi.c.1060) If this is PHP on Gentoo add fastcgi to the USE flags <br />1999-12-31 16:21:17: (mod_fastcgi.c.1356) [ERROR]: spawning fcgi failed. <br />1999-12-31 16:21:17: (server.c.834) Configuration of plugins failed. Going down.</p><p>Same thing.&nbsp; From what I can tell (and my knowledge is novice) from the web interface, php5-fastcgi is installed, as is php5-mod-gd, php5-mod-pcre, php5-mod-session, php5-mod-sqlite, php5-mod-xml.</p>									</div>
