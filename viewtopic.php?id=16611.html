					<p>Yes, I just found out how to get into it. Now trying to get why the UI won&#039;t come up. I am running LUCi but seems bad gateway is all I get. </p><p>I even tried just reinstall but seems from SSH that does not change anything back to brand new install so it is broken still<br />Going to fool with it some more each night. really hope get this running <br />I had to work on getting the thing to even connect on lan to internet via ssh so I could pkg install .. but that has been done after I manually downloaded using my pc and transferred the files to the router then installed from there.</p>									</div>
