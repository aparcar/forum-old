					<p>Hallo,</p><p>first thanks for the effort and the progress made to get OpenWRT running on the WLR-8100.</p><p>Due to the available *.dfl files it was easy for me to get OpenWRT installed on my new WLR-8100. Everthing seems to work fine with the exception of the 5 GHz (802.11ac). In the wiki there is a link to a bin file with the 5 GHz support. I&#039;m not so familiar with OpenWRT, how do I use / install this bin file in a running OpenWRT system?</p><p>Thanks for the support<br />&nbsp; Pit</p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to install LEDE from scratch a few days ago and got 5ghz also working. Since the installation procedure is not very clear, I thought I&#039;d summarize here what I did to get everything working:</p><p>There seems to be no need to hook into the UART or to do the two-step procedure described in the OpenWrt wiki. Simply uploading the LEDE sysupgrade firmware via stock interface, as @rmblr mentioned, worked fine for me. There is a warning message from the stock interface when doing this, but it seems safe to ignore.<br />After the install was complete I could login and setup everything as I needed (I have a very simple, AP only setup). At this point I got everything working except the 5 GHz wireless interface, which wouldn&#039;t even show up.<br />I noticed in the wiki under &quot;Enabling 5GHz&quot; that ath10k wireless driver is mentioned. The LEDE default installation seems to only ship with ath9k driver. So I went to the Software install page and downloaded the ath10k kernel driver and firmware packages, &quot;kmod-ath10k&quot; and &quot;ath10k-firmware-qca988x&quot; respectively.<br />After reboot it still did not work, but I saw in the system logs that the kernel did try to load the driver. I then followed the instructions on the wiki: ssh&#039;ed into the router and edited the file &quot;/etc/modules.d/55-ath10k&quot;, adding &quot;skip_otp=y&quot; to both lines.<br />After another reboot the 5GHz interface did show up and I was able to configure it. Unfortunately, my laptop wouldn&#039;t connect to it though, complaining about the password. I managed to solve this by forcing encryption cipher to CCMP, rather than &quot;auto&quot;.</p><p>It seems to work great so far. I&#039;m using 5GHz all the time and I&#039;ve had no problems streaming HD video nor using Skype. I&#039;m not sure falling back to 2.4GHz is working correctly though (eg. when moving out of range), I need to test it a bit more.</p>									</div>
