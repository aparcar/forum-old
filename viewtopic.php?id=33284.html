					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have just migrated from DDWRT to OpenWRT. </p><p>I installed OpenWrt 10.3.1 RC6, twice. The first time I was trying to auto-mount the USB drive and make the router use the usb drive as its main storage - basically, use the USB drive as the host for installed packeds.</p><p>I was not able to mount using luci (it just did not work). I was able to mount only by adding &quot;mout etc etc&quot; to startup scripts. But this only mounted the space for storage, while all packets would run and install in the available 5mb.</p><p>So, how can I make the USB drive to be mounted as root and be used for packets &amp; auto-mounted?</p><p>The router is a WRT160NL, the hdd drive is a 60bg drive with a 128mb swap partition and the rest ext3.</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much!</p><p>I managed. However, under /etc/init.d/fstab I had to add a &quot;sleep 20s&quot;, otherwise it would not work. Probably fstab tried to run to early.</p>									</div>
