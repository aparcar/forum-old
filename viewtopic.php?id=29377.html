					<p>Hey,</p><p>So I really like having the serial console on my Mikrotik device, but I also want to be able to use that port for a GPS receiver.</p><p>I was able to comment out the relevant lines in my /etc/inittab so that the console was disabled altogether, but now my only access to the device is through ssh... if I somehow mess up the networking on it, I won&#039;t be able to get back in.</p><p>What I&#039;d like to be able to do is have a 1-2 second window after bootup, in which I can press a specific key and get the serial console, but after which it will be killed and I can use the port to talk to my GPS.</p><p>Does this sound reasonable? What would be the best way to set up such a thing?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>

					<p>This isn&#039;t a perfect solution, but what I&#039;ve found I can do is:</p><p>1. In /etc/inittab, change the &quot;askfirst&quot; actions to be &quot;once&quot; instead.<br />2. In the startup for the component which talks to the GPS, wait an appropriate period of time and then just use a combination of ps and grep to find the process number of the ash instance, and kill -9 it. In a more advanced version, this could also be triggered by a network ping or some other external indicator that it&#039;s okay to go ahead with the GPS activity.</p>									</div>
