But that is your problem not the forum&#039;s. The point I made is, you set out rather dramatically to show that a user of this topic abused a company, by trying to do the same he/she did only with explicitly giving the company less incentive to help, by being not very polite and by explicitly mentioning the re-flashing. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You actually succeeded in getting an offer to have the device (which I doubt you own) replaced. Since that was not the point you wanted to make/ the answer you wanted you simply ignored the data/reality at hand and want off on your often used not-a-native-speaker tangent that magically always works in your favor <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />. So far your data nicely backs up HooToojunkie&#039;s description quite well.</p><p>There is nothing fascist in observing that you keep flogging deaf horses until it is obvious to everyone (neither literally nor figuratively). </p><p>The poor wronged &quot;merchant&quot; in your fable above freely offered to exchange the device in question in spite of your attempt at declaring you tampered with the device. The merchant obviously understands a bit more about how to operate their business than you do (after all they have a successful business, do you?), so instead of applauding them for a demonstration of great customer support you seem hell-bent in supporting your initial hypothesis contrary to the accumulated evidence.</p><p>This pattern is what I summarized with you loose arguments and you will keep doing it, because data/reality matters, being correct or incorrect matters, and finally politeness matters*.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p><br /><p>*) You complain I do not act very polite towards you? Correct, but you earned that treatment over time by trying hard to troll me (with rather modest success).</p>									</div>

While I dispute that this describes HooTooJunkie&#039;s behavior I do want to propose, you either not complain about others behaving like you do, but rather change your behavior so it can serve others as good example. If there is one thing ironic with your attitude it is the complete lack of objectivity and fairness. But do not give up, we will be able to help you through this together...</p><br /><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>
