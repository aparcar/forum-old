					<p>That would be ideally, but I think is impossible to get GPL sources of the wl.ko, as broadcom didn&#039;t release those under GPL. So I&#039;d do it the unofficial way, take the requried files from dd-wrt sources and interleave them into the openwrt sources and build an image, for my and anyone else&#039; purpose, who is interested.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All, </p><p>Some months ago, I bought a used R6300V2 from ebay, and I have to go aboard ,so I don&#039;t have enough time to use/test it . <br />these days, I just start to use it ,and found this R6300 V2 can&#039;t be use ,the WAN port and the last LAN port (near the WAN port) can&#039;t be connected, the port always be disconnected. </p><p>in addition, this is a Charter ISP version(MyCharterWIFIxxx) ,board_id= U12H240T70_NETGEAR </p><p>I have flashed it to DD-WRT with Kong&#039;s build,seems got the same result ,wan port can&#039;t work. <br />another new found is the CPU temperature is very high ,after power on about 5-10 minutes, it will reach 90+ degree centigrade. </p><p>seems ebay seller has no response to my mail, </p><p>all the WIFI works and 3 LAN port can works. CFE/TTL serial console also works well. <br />the wan port has been broken by cpu high temperature ? <br />anyone can help me ?</p>									</div>

I got to the point where I tried to flash the `squashfs-noloader-nodictionary.trx` file but the netgear GUI said it only supported *.chk files (and looking at the code, it also accepts bin files). I don&#039;t have access to the serial connection and I can&#039;t seem to get tftp to work.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
