					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I like to use OpenDNS as it&#039;s better than the British Telecom (BT) ISP provided one, but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve set it up properly and whether it&#039;s working. On all of my client devices it shows the primary DNS as the 192.168.1.1 (the router&#039;s IP) and the secondary DNS shows as 0.0.0.0 How do I check if the DNS is working and then how do I push it through to client devices to show the DNS&#039;s I&#039;ve set?</p><p>Any help appreciated</p><p>Will</p>									</div>

					<p>Your devices are using the router as a DNS; that is good, because it is acting as a cache, can filter out unwanted sites, can add internal mahcines, ... Now you just need to make sure that OpenWrt is using OpenDNS servers, and everything will be fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a look at those links you gave me, but most of it goes beyond me because I&#039;m extremely new to OpenWRT. I&#039;ve only stuck to the LuCI GUI on my Linksys WRT1900AC router because simple settings on router GUI&#039;s is what I&#039;ve been used to, so I haven&#039;t touched the command based set-ups such as looking and editing the config files etc. Could you care to explain how I see the &#039;/etc/dnsmasq.conf&#039; file please?</p><p>I&#039;ve downloaded PuTTY and I&#039;ve logged in. I first tried to go the file but I got permission denied. I then put &#039;vi&#039; in front and it chucked up this confusing page saying &#039;Change the following lines if you want dnsmaq to serve SRV records.&#039;</p><p>Will</p>									</div>

					<p>Do not due as I suggested, I do not think its right based upon Ed&#039;s comment. </p><p>Install WinSCP.&nbsp; It connects like putty, but gives you a windows file manager view of your routers &quot;OS&quot; and an editor for the files. <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">https://winscp.net/eng/download.php</a>&nbsp; Most of the config files are in the \etc\config folder.</p>									</div>
