					<p>I took the SL that ran the first Kaloz image of OpenWRT, and attempted a RAM upgrade.</p><p>I had a 512-meg SODIMM with Samsung K4H511638C-UCB3.&nbsp; This is a 512-Megabit chip and looks pin-compatible with Hynix except for maybe pin19.&nbsp; Anyhow I managed to get a RAM chip off the SODIMM the first time without much problem, following the video previously posted.</p><p>I was thinking to remove the original SL RAM and replace with this one, giving a 64-megabyte SL without having to mess with 20 SMD resistors.&nbsp; If that worked perhaps move on to putting on resistors and a 2nd RAM chip and see if it would go to 128 megabytes.</p><p>Next was removing RAM on SL unit. Unfortunately I used too much prying force on the chip and perhap too much heat, several solder pads came up with it.&nbsp; Arrrgh! BUTCHERED it.</p><p>Let this be a warning to other soldering n00bs, easy to think you&#039;ve figured it out then POOF!</p><p>*sigh*</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 25 Jun 2007, 03:25)</p>

					<p>Still have some hope. I&#039;m going to order the resistors.&nbsp; Then try putting a chip into the empty RAM position and see if it works.&nbsp; Best case, I at least have a working router with 64 megabytes eh?&nbsp; Not what I was aiming for but it would prove something and maybe salvage the situation.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 25 Jun 2007, 11:20)</p>

					<p>Maybe you should cut off the pins of the RAM modules on the router first with a small cutting disc or stanley knife? But it&#039;s too late now...<br />I got a SDRAM Module via Ebay with Chips for a 64MB upgrade of my WL-500gx some time ago, and it&#039;s still lying around because I&#039;m afraid doing it :-/</p>									</div>

					<p>You can still save the board if the ram lines terminate at some via, you can solder very fine guage wire to replace the broken trace.</p>									</div>

					<p>vincentfox:&nbsp; Go buy some.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth every penny.&nbsp; </p><p>nekmech:<br />Do you have a plunger type solder sucker?&nbsp; I have found decent success by using ample amounts of flux, heating the solder, and releasing the plunger.&nbsp; It should take off all the excess solder, leaving enough solder to connect the pin to the pad.&nbsp; Make sure to position the sucker before you heat the solder. </p><p>Keep in mind, you only really need solder to be under the pin and on the pad.&nbsp; Look at all the other connections on the board.&nbsp; More isn&#039;t better.</p><p>I&#039;m talking about something like this: <a href="http://www.allelectronics.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=50B-410">http://www.allelectronics.com/cgi-bin/c â€¦ em=50B-410</a></p>									</div>
