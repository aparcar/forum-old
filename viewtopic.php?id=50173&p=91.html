If you are having trouble with forum software, sorry. It is working for the greater percentage of us. In case you don&#039;t understand open source, it is just that open free for people to change, modify, play with, and do what ever their hearts desires with it. And most if not all of the developers here are doing it free and sharing it with the rest of us. That is awesome!!!! Thank you to all of you for sharing your talents.

So quit complaining about the forum software, and please quit posting the crap messages. </p><p>I personally resent your threats of breaking fingers of commercial programmers, some of us on here are that commercial programmers. I am one of those commercial programmers, I learned to program in assembly language and FORTRAN, back when memory/hard disk was a premium and your code had to fit into a very tiny little space. But I could a lot with both of those languages together, I could control printers, plotters and do some wonderful things with them. I enjoyed playing with registers and such..... Ah the memories.... But I digress off my point. My point is, every since your first post you have done nothing but complain and grip, and now you are demanding that software be repaired on a site that is being used. You indicated your programming skills is&nbsp; in windows, well this is windows... Why don&#039;t you fix it.</p><p>My final comment, if you are not going help by reporting errors, testing, or just be a sideline cheerleader to see this grow, mature and become a workable solution and you just want to spew complaints, please quit posting. Open source is not the place for you. I just know I am tired of hearing your complaints/crap such.&nbsp; </p><p>Later,</p></blockquote></div><p>Software is the most difficult to test and debug.</p><p>Our school systems have primary grade pupils and secondary grade students writing programs.
