However, though RC2 has all possible packages available to download, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s built in by default. So, after installing RC2, you may need to install some of the packages that are needed. This usually isn&#039;t a big deal.. I might have some time tonight to install RC2, just to see what&#039;s included in the build. Currently, the differences are going to be minimal as far as fixes, drivers, etc. However, I think it&#039;s cool that LEDE is finally going to put out an official &quot;Release&quot;, so some people may want to give it a go, and that&#039;s why I put the link on the website.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 11 Feb 2017, 16:49)</p>

Every day, improvements are made to the source code. In fact there are days where there can be 50 code improvements, or more, added to the source. So, if you have a &quot;snapshot&quot;, the day the source code was downloaded and built, includes all the bug fixes, drivers, kernel changes, etc. to that that very day. Something that I do differently, is all of the packages for that specific snapshot are saved on the server and are not over written for the next snapshot. This can be a huge advantage for those who don&#039;t upgrade as often, and want to add/download and install packages to their builds at a later time because those packages for their specific snapshot will be there. Something else I do, when needed, is to include patches that may not be in the source code. One example would be the current nslookup patch. Currently there&#039;s a issue with busybox that doesn&#039;t play well with nslookup, and causes Dynamic DNS to fail to update. Okay, so what about an official release. Releases will include all of the latest updates, patches, kernel&#039;s etc, but they too are snapshots in time, in a technical sense, because they don&#039;t get the daily changes in the source code, drivers, etc. Official releases will only come out so often, and this may be one of the reasons why one will find snapshots and 3rd party snapshots as they usually contain newer code especially when it comes to wifi drivers.</p><p>Lastly, I tend to think of snapshots as being &quot;bleeding edge&quot;, as opposed to Releases which when new are near the bleeding edge, but over time miss out on the fixes, driver updates, etc. That doesn&#039;t mean a Release shouldn&#039;t be used. Actually, releases can be a necessity, in many situations, depending on the requirements.</p>									</div>

I might have some time tonight to install RC2, just to see what&#039;s included in the build.</p></blockquote></div><p>Did you have time to check this David?<br />I would like to test the RC2 and maybe even the daily snapshot, just to see the differences.<br />But I&#039;m afraid that packages will disappear and I may have to reconfigure the whole router from scratch again.</p><p>P.S.<br />I just saw that your &quot;wrt1900acs-squashfs-sysupgrade&quot; file has a size of 8.831 kB.<br />The &quot;wrt1900acs-squashfs-sysupgrade&quot; file for RC2 or the latest snapshot version of LEDE has a size of only 4.511 kB.<br />Why such a huge difference in package size? Looks like your firmware install package includes much more software than the LEDE defaut one.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Geraner</strong> on 12 Feb 2017, 11:39)</p>

If you don&#039;t want to talk on the vid then will you put a write up up on the site so i will know how to do it thanks. there is no rush tho mate as I am just useing it as a router so far, but i will want to flash when the new wifi driver comes out. I am now on Lede leviathan III SNAPSHOT r3063-f2e6e11 / LuCI Master (git-17.020.82842-e1edb10) <br />I flashed from stock to Gargoyle and then over to the build i am on now. I don&#039;t know if there is any thing on the other partition. I will try and boot from the other partition later. All so can you post me a link for a USB TTL pleas I would like to make sure that i get the rite one. Can you use a USB TTL cable with out soldering? If not i am scrood haha. soldering&nbsp; my fingers would not be a good look!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you guys @aluisperezh @adri that is very odd then. I would be happy to record a video or send some logs if needed. The problem appears when the router is not connected or not receiving connection to/from the Modem. It is very subtle and can take up to 20min to crash sometimes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>haverlok</strong> on 15 Feb 2017, 04:53)</p>
