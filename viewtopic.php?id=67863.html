					<p>I have recently installed openwrt on the netgear R8000. I&#039;ve noticed a few things and if anyone can clear it up for me that would be great.</p><p>1: There are 3 bands on this router. When I try to configure all 3 to be on one stays disabled (Wireless is disabled or not associated):</p><br /><p>2: My nac radio seems to only give a fair signal even though I am right next to the router (3 feet away) (about 35-50% signal strength), and its set to 20dbm (100mW) (the highest I can set in the menu). Is there a way I can set this higher (although my bgn radio is set to the same strength and I get full bars...)?</p><p>3: I tried to change the width of the nac radio to 80 or 160 mhz but once I change it to this it turns the radio off (Wireless is disabled or not associated). I don&#039;t know what is happening here, but it works on 40 mhz.</p><p>4: I have a radius server I am using, and I install the required packages. Now when I set the radios (all 3) to wpa2-eap it refuses to connect to it (although on the radius server I get Access-Accept). When I switch it to wpa-eap it works fine. Any ideas?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
