					<p>I have now figured out how i get a Recovery image.<br />I just extracted the original update with binwalk.<br />And used the script MACverify.sh in /usr/sbin<br />i called it &quot;./MACverify.sh fullUEN vodafone_update&quot; then i renamed the vodafone_update to fullimage.img and moved it to the tftpd root directory.<br />After that i started the tftpd server and set the ip to 192.168.2.100.<br />Then i hold&nbsp; the reset button down and powered up the device. I released the reset Button, when the LCD shows a red Screen with Infos to the Recovery procedure.<br />Then the box flash the image to it. In my case it tooked 2 Minutes.<br />But for Secure you should wait 5-10 minutes to be safer.<br />Then you need to powercycle the box.</p><br /><p>If anyone is interested in the Firmware Image just write a post here, and i will try to explain what i know about it.</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>

					<p>yeah it latinq based i think. I can&#039;t say anything about the Hardware yet because i have no shell access in all.<br />It run&#039;s already a modifed openwrt but arcadyan never released the GPL Code of _ANY_ router.<br />The recovery image is very special the images get checked by a public key and have a signature file in it.<br />But the Firmware check Script have a security vulnerable it doesn&#039;t chekc if the public key is on the System (it&#039;s in the bash Script but commented out <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )<br />mrkiko has mailed to GPL Violations and somebody has contact to a lawyer from Vodafone.<br />The Vodafone men said that they will publish a gpl-tarball but i don&#039;t belive that till i see it.<br /> If you interested on these device we can maybe build a firmware with telnet for the device to get more informations over it.</p><p>I&#039;m looking forward to hearing from you</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmkay, then GPL Violations is the way to go!</p><p>Personally I am not interested in this router. We have good wire-based broadband available and no money for the hardware nor for the LTE carrier. At the moment. This could change and we could want or need LTE ;-)</p><p>I am interested in an overview over the available silicon intellectual property regarding the &quot;last mile&quot; out there, and of course the available FOSS Linux support for this solutions. There does not seem to be really much competition and even less Linux support :-(</p><p>Have a look here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc#companies">SoCs</a>.</p><p>AFAIK intel acquired SIP for DOCSIS from Texas Instrument but I don&#039;t see any products.</p><p>Broadcom definitely has own SIP on DSL and DOCSIS, for both there is no FOSS support. Don&#039;t know about LTE or any older Cellular standards (like UMTS, EDGE, CDMA2000). Broadcom also designed their own MIPS-based CPUs, which produced some problems. There was also a problem with a driver for some of their Ethernet IP, that was not GPL&#039;ed. and so on.</p><p>If you look at Openmoko, it is quite expensive. It seems to be a solid mobile phone, and I do not require any of the android-apps out there. But it is expensive. Biggest problem is (I think) the Linux support for the cellular SIP and of course the numbers of sold units. :-(((</p><p>If you read a bit around in the Internet, it also seems to be, that very old (ancient) solutions from 1980 get a patent in 2005. This kills possible competition right away.</p>									</div>

					<p>I got a similar device, an easybox 904 xDSL. It would be great if i could use it with another provider, but it&#039;s impossible to change the account data or get access to the config files which have to be somewhere on the device. i found that it is possible to telnet to port 2001, there&#039;s soem kind of configuration otion but i have no idea how to use it.</p><p>A fe days ago there was a new firmware released for the 904 xDSL, so it&#039;s possible to extract the sqhasfs fromt the firmware. Wouldit be possible to activate dropbox somehwo and access the box via ssh? I&#039;ve seen that the binaries are included and the whole system is a modiefied openwrt already. here&#039;s the link: <a href="http://hilfe.vodafone.de/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1003&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;CMD=BROWSE_TOPIC&amp;USERTYPE=1&amp;LANGUAGE=de&amp;COUNTRY=de&amp;TOPIC_ID=323482&amp;SUB_TOPIC_NAME=&amp;DISPLAY=DEVICE&amp;NAVIGATION_TOPIC_ID=0">http://hilfe.vodafone.de/system/selfser … TOPIC_ID=0</a></p><p>any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi toyboy,<br />that&#039;s interessting. Google said that port 2001 is used by telnet server or trojans i think it should be a telnet server.<br />Some people from gpl-violations.org have managed to get the source code of the easybox 904 LTE. <br />But it&#039;s not officially released it&#039;s more like a alpha in that we should check if all GPL licensed Software included.<br />I can&#039;t actually try if port 2001 is also open on the Easybox 904 LTE because i make a mistake on soldering and now I&#039;m waiting for desoldering Iron.</p><p>The LTE Firmware is looked down as much as possible. You not even can enter the U Boot without a password. The password is checked against a sha1 hash.<br />The console Output is disabled right after starting the Kernel.<br />Maybe you can join the irc so that we can speak better about it.</p><p>PS: You should also go the way over gpl-violations.org, because Nils Faerber already has contact to Vodafone. <a href="http://lists.gpl-violations.org/pipermail/tech/2013-July/000278.html">http://lists.gpl-violations.org/piperma … 00278.html</a></p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>

					<p>hey middey, i opened my box now and found the 4-pin connector, i think that&#039;s the serial port? it&#039;s also visible in the pictures earlier in this thread. i will buy a serial to usb converter to access it, hopefully this will give access to a console session? could you point me towards more information how to access u-boot on such devices like the easybox 904 lte (and hopefully xDSL as well)?at the moment i can&#039;t even use the box because it&#039;s ISP locked, no way to enter new login information.</p><p>@ blogic: sorry, but i can&#039;t spare too much money at the moment... i got mine for a what i think was a fair price... 50 euros on ebay. the xDSL is a neat device, if it was possible to run openwrt on it it would serve all my home-LAN needs <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>hi toyboy, I have no good messages for you. I have connected the 4 pin Connector (Yes it is a TTL Port) but you have no acces to the u-boot.<br />If you interupt the boot process you get the question for a password. In the Source File of the uboot i found the passage in that the password is checked.<br />But it get hashed with sha1 and compared with the sha1 hash hardcoded in the uboot. I think it is not possible to crack this sha1 hash.<br />I think you cannot even change the isp in the config file. I think the ISP is hardcoded in a binary and till now you haven&#039;t a source code.<br />And if you get them It&#039;s nohi toyboy, I have no good messages for you.

Update to the newest firmware. ( I have looked a bit in it and as far as i see they haven&#039;t deactivated the failsafe mode.)<br />So while booting you should press the reset button many times. But wait a little bit before you starting, because when you press it to early the box will boot in a tftp mode.<br />PS: Can you make some Photos of your device too ?<br />@blogic my device is actually bricked as because i make a mistake while soldering I&#039;m waiting for the tool that i have ordered. And hope i can remove the solder bridge on the flash.</p><p>Best regardst sure if this binary code is included.<br />But maybe i have another possibility to gain acces to the box.

					<p>Hm ok,<br />Yesterday I unbricked my Box and try to build the new Firmware with the GPL Sourcecode of it ( Thanks to GPL-Violations.org).<br />But while booting it freezes my Laptop didn&#039;t recognized the lan port. And on the Serial interface was still no Output more than before.<br />After that i edited the include/image.mk, so that it use my dir to build a squashfs file from it. I extracted in that dir the Vodafone firmware and make my changes so that i have now telnet and serial enabled.<br />Now i&#039;m dump the flash of the device and after that i will try flashing the GPL image on it and look for debug output whats happened.<br />I still not know the password for the bootloader, i have the source files of the uboot and in that is the password as sha1 hashed string.<br />I think it is inpossible to crack the hash.<br />I will later ask on the irc whats the best way to go. Blogic and the other users in the irc helped me very much so i like to say thank you to all.</p><p>@ toyboy if you want you can join the irc channel #openwrt on irc.freenode.org. Then we can talk about it and don&#039;t spam the forums <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>
