					<p>@sera, a note on your last patch-set. Did a build and flashed both the ubi and squash images on my v1 to the same outcome I previously reported; random reboot, cause unknown, as of yet no single discernible cause. Have not been able to collect any relevant log data as it has never flushed at an opportune time to my remote linux box. I suppose instrumenting the build is an option but then observer effect ...</p><p>Might take a shot at the 4.8 kernel this weekend.</p><p>Edit: On another note, regarding my previous observation about the jump in cpu utilization on my mamba. About the same time as the last mwlwifi release, I was modifying my build and had changed from dnsmasq to dnsmasq-full, as I wanted to possibly put dnssec into play. Right now that is looking like the likely suspect, but why an order of magnitude uptick, especially since it is not yet actually doing ipsec? Might try backing that out to prove one way or ta&#039;other.</p><p>Edit2: Doesn&#039;t look like that was the issue. An interesting aside, where both cpu&#039;s have been ~20% from when I first noticed the change, one is now ~18%, one ~16%. So I&#039;m guessing the hard float pushes from a day or two back had a discernible impact.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Villeneuve</strong> on 31 Aug 2016, 23:12)</p>

					<p>@sera<br />As it looked like things were back to good I put the mamba back in it&#039;s usual place, so currently do not have serial connected. Probably pull it again to hook serial up if I get to trying out 4.8. It occurred first on patch-set dated Aug.24 (so one back from current/last).</p><p>I backed out dnsmasq-full to see if that was the cause, but it was not. The next likely suspect is ubus.

Nothing leaps out at me as &quot;that&#039;s it&quot;, there is just this very different @ idle before-after(1-2%,2-4% on each cpu - 18%,16% on each cpu) graph on the stats screen.</p><p>@shm0<br />I thought this was a non-neon device?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Villeneuve</strong> on 1 Sep 2016, 14:03)</p>

					<p>@sera Good call. I did a 4.8-rc4 build and flashed the UBI image. From your last post I decided I would leave wireless down to see how it behaved. It ran for a few hours with no issues, so I setup the /etc/config/wireless file and brought wireless up. Started connecting wireless devices and all went well until the one fruit device in the house, and it all came tumbling down. I can&#039;t say for sure it was the ipad2 on ac, it&#039;s the only ac device I have, but that is when things went South. When I get a chance I will pull the mamba and connect it to serial to see if I can get anything of value from the console. Another point of interest, @idle cpu numbers are in the 1-4% range with this image, of course sans wireless. Now, where did I put that snake hook.</p><p>The 4.4-rc4 images are available if anyone wants to test behaviour on a different device.</p>									</div>
