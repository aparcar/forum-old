					<p>Hey David,</p><p>first I wanted to thank you for providing this great optimized Image you provide for WRT 1900... </p><p>Yesterday i tried to mount an NTFS-Drive over USB 3.0 and I failed to get automount working... now i would like to know, if it is my fault or if it is an openwrt bug. I use the latest image: 9b84c3ab05d95bb059b55953909485163c88d34a3f337019ea282e6cec5516b4 2018-03-25 02:27 without any further packages or modifications.</p><p>At first i tried to manually mount the device, which worked like expected:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1/

The WRT1900ACv2 should be about the same as my WRT1200ACv1 and there have been no troubles with my wifi for either band.

Have you noticed a difference running the 1900ACS firmware on the 1900ACv2? That seems to be a wild move. Maybe there were regulatory changes made to the ACS that are not good for the ACv2? </p><p>Maybe somebody else has a suggestion. I am out of ideas.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, to clarify the firmware&nbsp; I have ran and used during brake in started with stock build that came on my router.</p><p>Once I realised the original firmware had bugs, i quickly upgraded to the latest build. Which at the time had issues with android devices. Was getting up to 20 mbps max. After trial and error, i found i needed to customise my android device to get around 45 mbps download speeds on the 5GHz&nbsp; N band&nbsp; with a 150 mbps connection. With 2.4ghz N I connect at 72 mbps and have up to 35 mbps download speeds. With my laptop I can get 120 mbps download speeds with a 300mbps connection.</p><p>So after making sure no router issues were apparent, i move on to ACS V1 firmware and tested. Then moved on to Linksys ACS V2 firmware and decided on linksys UK firmware for my base to keep and run happily with.</p><p>So the only issues I found were with the factory base firmware. Once I got that resolved,&nbsp; then moved on to test some of David&#039;s builds, back in February.&nbsp; Did not have an issue but knew there was newer and better builds to come, so i waited for my warranty to end and move to test with the current builds.</p><p>I see no differences between AC/v2 and ACS builds from David, nor do I see any improvements from one over the other.</p><p>I think if here is an issue, it may be the newest changes to v2 hardware from refurbishment program, in closing up open doors&nbsp; for overriding features.</p><p>At this time, no matter how i configure for the best connectivity that seems stable enough, there is no benefit to run the newer build for me at this time. There is another option to try but it is from a different party not supported here. If none of the newest builds ever work out for me, I may move on to try my final option to move away from the stagnant linksys outdated firmware.</p>									</div>

As we add more and more wireless devices, MU-MIMO will be a feature we want to take advantage of.</p>									</div>

There have been some who have flashed from the partition they are on, but I don&#039;t necessarily recommend it. What you can do is just use the advance reboot in LuCi, and boot back over to the factory firmware. From the factory FM use the .img to flash the lede partition. I&#039;m not sure that it will let you do the .bin from the factory FW, but you can try as that will likely keep your settings.</p>									</div>
