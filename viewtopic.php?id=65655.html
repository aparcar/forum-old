					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I recently got my hands on a TP-LINK TL-WR841ND v7.2 wireless router. I wanted to flash its art partition to remove all Tx power caps and only have the regulatory domain limits apply, as I have already done with several others of the same brand. However, this particular model and revision uses a AR9287 chip, unlike my other routers, which were all AR93xx. Its ART layout is completely different, and thus pepe2k&#039;s excellent ar9300_eeprom tool reads (and writes) bogus values.</p><p>I found structs for the AR9287&#039;s EEPROM <a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/ar9300_eeprom/blob/master/include/eeprom.h"><span class="bbu">here</span></a>, and they appear to match the contents of my partition. I tried editing the regdomain, but after flashing the new data, I discovered it has an integrity check (although the expected checksum shows up in dmesg, so in theory it should be possible to fix it and reflash). At this point, I halted all further testing, restored the original ART and decided to start this thread.</p><p>What is known about the AR9287&#039;s art partition layout? Are &quot;high power&quot; modifications possible? <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=295563#p295563"><span class="bbu">This</span></a> post says the TL-WR841ND v7.x can transmit at up to 27 dBm merely by using a special OpenWrt build. But even after applying reghack2 (which should be the equivalent of &quot;Force Atheros drivers...&quot; for the 00 and US regions, my EEPROM being locked to the latter), I can&#039;t get mine to go above 21 dBm. All the other information I was able to find applies to PCI wireless cards using this chip, not routers, but I&#039;ll leave it here for reference.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/andyvand/AtherosROMKit">AtherosROMKit</a><br /><a href="https://jankrupa.com/projects/ath-eeprom-tool/">Ath EEPROM Tool</a><br /><a href="http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2014/08/one-of-my-atheros-ar9280-minipcie-cards.html">How to change Atheros AR9xxx aka ath9k EEPROM values</a><br /><a href="http://www.progtown.com/topic353822-support-80211n-on-cards-with-atheros-ar9xxx-chips-it-is-readable-the-first-page.html">Support 802.11n on cards with Atheros AR9xxx chips</a><br /><a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/rebranding-the-atheros-928x-cards-the-guide.115110/">Rebranding the Atheros 928x cards - The guide</a><br /><a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/299732-atheros-9k-series-rom-modding-tools-and-recovery-kit/">Atheros 9K Series ROM Modding Tools And Recovery Kit</a></p><p>Also, here&#039;s a dump of my router&#039;s ART in case anyone wants to investigate (run <strong>echo UEsDB... | base64 -d - &gt; art.zip</strong> in a terminal to get the file, then unzip).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>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</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m also interested on out-of-band transmission, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible under Windows, unfortunately. It requires modded drivers, and the source code for Windows binaries (of any brand) is rarely open. Please have a look at the following article.</p><p><a href="http://yo3iiu.ro/blog/?p=1301">Using WiFi Atheros chips in hamradio bands</a></p><p>A workaround may be getting online with an Atheros-based router in client or WDS mode and running a version of OpenWrt compiled with the above hacks, effectively using the router as a WLAN adapter.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m currently using the TL-WR841ND v7.2 with the EEPROM-enforced power limit of 21 dBm. If possible, I&#039;d like to double it to 24 to improve coverage (27, as per the post I linked to, seems excessive), so any pointers would be appreciated. I wonder whether <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/kernel/mac80211/patches/402-ath_regd_optional.patch"><span class="bbu">this</span></a> would work...</p>									</div>
