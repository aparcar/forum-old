					<p>I have tried to upgrade from Barrier Breaker 14.07 a few times but the rt-n56u does not seem to work with Chaos Chalmer 15.05. No ping, no webgui, no nothing. Had to recover it with asus rescue utility after every upgrade attempt.</p><p>So is Asus RT-N56U (not B1 version) incompatible with Chaos Chalmer?</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess not many people run Openwrt on their RT-N56U&#039;s <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />. </p><p>I am staying on BB for now but i have a vlan switch on the way and i will not need the vlan functionality of OpenWrt when the switch arrives so i guess i will revert to Asus fw and set it up as an accesspoint. </p><p>Anyway BB has worked fine the time i have used it.</p>									</div>

Problem i have is that everything is self taught. I have no formal network training what so ever. I was reading up on the putty version to copy the padavan version to the tmp section on my router but I couldn&#039;t accomplish the task. Any links to assist?</p><p>Thank you,<br />Dan.</p>									</div>
