					<p>Hey all, long time lurker here.</p><p>I&#039;ve been researching and using OpenWRT for a year now on several WRT54GL 1.1s. Yes, old hardware and thus has lost the focus in the world of loads of ram and flash. But hell I have loads of them so I&#039;m constantly tinkering.</p><p>In researching all the packages for the GL, one seems to be sketchy (at least in my searching) - aircrack-ng and monitor mode on the broadcom 5352. Loads of tutorials (specifically for kismet_drone) but very hit and miss for me. I&#039;ve found a way, which seems &quot;dirty&quot; and I&#039;d like some refinement, if someone is willing to help. If nothing else, it&#039;s at least a search hit to help someone else.</p><p>I&#039;ve pulled down backfire&#039;s svn and compiled with:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - base packages<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - kernel 2.6.32-27-1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - kmod b43 with firmware 4.10.2160 &amp; driver 4.150.10.5(stable)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - kmod b43 legacy 2.6.32.27 + 2011-12-01-1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - aircrack-ng 1.1-3</p><p>On bootup, iwconfig shows 2 interfaces. wlan0 &amp; mon.wlan0. Using mon.wlan0 in airodump yields sporatic results - sometimes it&#039;s captures, sometimes a channel sticks. Using airmon-ng start mon.wlan0 spits out a mon0 interface. If I put it through airodump, it&#039;ll capture but stick to the first channel that an ap resides on. Toggling wlan0 down then up and repeating airodump on mon0 clears it up and it scans all channels automatically and never sticks (unless the -c option is used, which works perfect). And for the record, airserv-ng is one great tool for low memory applications.</p><p>So it seems I&#039;m &quot;successful&quot; but behavior tells me otherwise. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated - still learning everyday <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
