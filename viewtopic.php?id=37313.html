					<p>It is the same question as &quot;difference between router and switch&quot;, but here is OpenWrt,so i said wireless router and AP.<br />I know &quot;One works at IP layer,the other works at Data-Link Layer&quot;, what i want to know is more deeper.<br />For my understanding, from Hardware aspect, there is no difference between them(ignore the LAN port.),all the difference was showed in the Software aspect, wireless router is a AP which installed some &quot;route softwares&quot;?<br />Is my understanding correct? if yes,what are those &quot;router softwares&quot;?I mean, in the Make Menuconfig,what modules will be&nbsp; more selected if i want to build a wireless router firmware rather than AP firmware?<br />I know there is a RIP protocol in a router, what is the name of this module in backfire menuconfig?</p>									</div>

					<p>A router will handle all traffic on the network. It directs traffic internally and between the internal and external networks. The router is actually a separate component from the access point. They work together but are not the same even though they are in the same box.</p><p>An access point is basically just that. It translates from wired to wireless and that&#039;s about it. The more advanced ones have management features but they are very simple devices. Think of an access point as a wireless switch.</p><p>Source : <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-wireless-networking-41/difference-between-access-point-and-wireless-router-203886/">http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions â€¦ er-203886/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ZorbaJor</strong> on 5 Jun 2012, 21:41)</p>
