					<p>Hi, I want buy a modem router with the following features:<br />1) standard jtag interface with holes like on dlink dir-615 rev e (and serial, ofcourse)<br />2) not expensive<br />3) better without wireless<br />4) for italy</p><p>For example the d-link dir-615 rev e4 should be ok but here in italy is very difficult to find it. I searched on ebay and amazon but italian seller are rather silly, they don&#039;t know what revision they are selling. Someone sell a &quot;d-link dir-615/e&quot; but he&nbsp; does not&nbsp; know if the object is a &quot;rev.e&quot;. Also they can&#039;t (or want) check.<br />Thank you.</p>									</div>
