					<p>Hello!</p><p>We posses seven&nbsp; Cambria GW2358-4 network platforms with the latest openWRT installed. Everything works nice except the CF card reader where the speed is slow. We tested the Reading and writing to CF but the maximum average transfer speed never exceeded 500 kb/s, which i quite slow.&nbsp; I also tested openWRT on x86 platform with CF reader attached to IDE interface, and the speed is adequate (9MB/s). </p><p>However, I&#039;m wondering if anyone has any experience with CF on Cambria GW2358-4 and found it slow? Is it maybe a hardware issue? I&#039;ve been searching in Cambria specification for any useful information about CF, but without a luck.</p><p>Best regards!</p>									</div>
