					<p>If you&#039;ve not already done so, I&#039;d suggest hooking up a serial console so you can see what&#039;s going on - I think it&#039;s much more likely something that&#039;ll be easy to fix once you can see what&#039;s going on</p><p>Hopefully <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=243643#p243643">this post</a> will help, it&#039;s got some useful issue from when I thought I&#039;d bricked mine last year - I only which I&#039;d had a decent cable when I had issues with my previous router, my dodgy soldering job did for that one <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>The serial console detail are in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500#serial">wiki</a>, but I don&#039;t think it covers the jtag details, which I&#039;m hoping won&#039;t be needed anyway</p>									</div>

					<p>If you only need pure serial (TTY / UART) i recommend you FTDI FT232RL (around $2.50 on ebay incl. shipping), and for SPI flashing, Raspberry Pi (price without VAT and shipping depends on model 20-35$) with Flashrom can handle this stuff, also UART and I2C, even JTAG via GPIO Bit-Banging using OpenOCD. </p><p>EDIT: FT4232H - quad channel UART and BitBang with 2 Channels also possible SPI, JTAG and I2C.

					<p>as i can see C2 uses simple 25Q64 winbond flash chip which can be programmed by <a href="http://aliexpress.com/af/ch341a-progammer.html">CH341A based 3$ USB programmer</a><br />also you can order <a href="http://aliexpress.com/af/sop8-clip.html">sop8 clip</a> to flash it without unsoldering</p>									</div>

					<p>not exactly, probably you need to cut a header of original image<br />or you can flash only uboot by programmer keeping other data untouched and flash original image from uboot tftp recovery mode</p>									</div>
