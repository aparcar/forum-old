					<p>I have a Buffalo WZR-HT-AG300H that I have erased the bootloader from and am attemping to recover it.<br />I do have an identical device and have copied (via dd) the contents of the flash from the previous device.<br />I also currently have full debug access through openOCD JTAG as I have connected into the JTAG port.</p><p>However, the thing that I am missing is a way to boot the device.<br />I have been attempting to build das U-Boot for the device, but it seems to not load.<br />I can connect to the openOCD interface with telnet localhost 4444 then issue the load_image and resume commands, however, I don&#039;t seem to have any code that is sutiable.</p><p>What I am really after is just a way to boot the device so I can rewrite the bootloader &quot;redboot&quot; or any other sutible, and recover the device.</p><p>Initially what happened is I overwrote mtd0 by mistake instead of the proper flash area when attempting to modify the current firmware image.</p><p>If you have any recommendations or can provide any assistance, it would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Other useful information,<br />from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-ag300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-ag300h</a><br />Architecture:&nbsp; &nbsp; MIPS<br />Vendor:&nbsp; &nbsp; Qualcomm Atheros<br />Bootloader:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; crippled U-Boot<br />System-On-Chip:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; AR7161 rev 2 (MIPS 24Kc V7.4)<br />CPU/Speed&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 24Kc V7.4 680 MHz<br />Flash-Chip:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ?<br />Flash size:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 32 MiB<br />RAM:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 128 MiB<br />Wireless:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Atheros AR9223 (2.4GHz) and AR9220 (5.0GHz) 802.11abgn<br />Ethernet:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; AR8316</p>									</div>

					<p>I have this router working with OpenWRT. If you have JTAG working, I could send you an image of my CFE (it reports itself as U-Boot, not redboot, but it is the stock CFE). You could then load the CFE back to mtd0 using JTAG if you know how.</p><p>Did you also delete mtd8? That would be unfortunate...</p><p>I am fascinated by your statement that you have connected the JTAG, since I had mine open and didn&#039;t find a JTAG header.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t remove the RF shielding, was it under there? I also haven&#039;t found any documentation even hinting that it could be done...</p><p>Anyway, back to your problem. I know it&#039;s been months since you posted, but if you still need it, I can get you my CFE. You&#039;ll need to edit it in a binary editor to change some things, like the mac addresses, pin, default WPA password, etc. I will of course anonymize these things before sending...</p>									</div>
