					<p>Just as a general remark, characters beyond the printable set of 7-bit ASCII is a recipe for disaster, as different interpretations among different operating systems and implementations are bound to happen (in the case of emojis even up to the problem of font support on your clients).</p><p>While hostapd.conf does correctly treat the SSID as binary, the escaping from the config files is interpreted by UCI, shell (to generate the temporary hostapd.conf) and even your browser (when entering it), which introduces quite some margin of breakage among these different entities here as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not using LuCi. I copied the respective line from /etc/config/wireless in my post.<br />As I wrote already.<br />And you might read org hostapd.conf regarding valid ssid formats.<br />Before doing some wrong assumptions.</p><p>But to clarify, you might post the contents of /etc/config/wireless after using LuCi successfully.<br />Which might give some serious insights.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>augustus_meyer</strong> on 8 Jan 2018, 17:40)</p>

					<p>The valid SSID formats you&#039;ve been trying to use are defined for the `ssid2` option of hostapd.conf, not the `ssid` option which is mapped by OpenWrt.</p><p>For the contents of /etc/config/wireless refer to the screenshot above.</p>									</div>
