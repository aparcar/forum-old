					<p>Hi selepo,</p><br /><p>I am using exactly the same setup - sshd running on my WRT54GS router and PuTTY on a remote Windows box.</p><p>Most of the time I am using LOCAL port forwading - for example, I map the local port 1234 to the LAN side of the router at port 3389, let&#039;s say 192.168.0.50:3389. With this mapping in place, I can open a RDP session (Remote Desktop) to my home machine (mstsc localhost:1234).</p><p>The dynamic mapping is used when your local client application can use SOCKS proxy. If you map Dynamic port 8080, you can test your setup if you change the proxy settings of your browser - set the proxy address as localhost and port 8080 and the proxy type should be SOCKS. I used the latter setup when I worked in enterprises where very restrictive proxies and firewalls were in place - that way I could browse &quot;forbidden&quot; sites using my home ADSL connection via SSH tunneling.</p><br /><p>Regards<br />Zdravko</p>									</div>

If you set up dynamic port forward, you need your to set application (e.g. firefox, pidgin or whatever)&nbsp; to connect to the SOCK proxy on localhost:8080 as znanev said <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Tex</p>									</div>

					<p>What I do is:</p><p>Connect via SSH2 using putty like this: host:443 (need to use a prot that the proxy will let through). On the Router port 443 is rerouted to port 22, and ssh access is given after login. <br />Tunnel is set up as: D1080 (soure port 1080, dynamic).</p><p>Firefox is set to use proxy localhost, port 1080. </p><p>When firefox does a request I get back a response immedieately with a white page. I can&#039;t find any traffic on the router (using tcpdump) and I can&#039;t look at the data travelling from my work comupter since the traffic is encrypted...</p><p>Best Regards<br />Selepo</p>									</div>
