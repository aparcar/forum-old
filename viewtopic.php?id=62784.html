					<p>Hi.</p><p>I would like to provide a router with a 4G dongle, and provide internet as a captive portal through Wifi.<br />I have this working. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Now, I would like to access the router from home, for maintenance and check of Realtime Traffic.</p><p>The USB 4G modem is a HUAWEI E3372 LTE.</p><p>As far as I can tell, there is no ports open for incoming traffic.<br />And there is no easy possibility to change this.</p><p>Does anyone have a suitable idea?<br />I was thinking of setting up a outgoing VPN connection to somewhere from the router, to establish a connection,<br />and then I should be able to go back in through that connection.</p><p>Is that possible?</p>									</div>

					<p>The best way I know is having miredo on your router.<br />But unfortunately openwrt dropped official support for miredo quite long ago.<br />I succeeded compiling miredo for myself and it works well, but it required some efforts with patching source.</p>									</div>
