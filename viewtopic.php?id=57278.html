					<p>Im using gargoyle router firmware version 1.6.1 which is based on OPENWRT in TP-LINK 1043nd v1.8 . Days ago my WAN port and LAN3 port are dead because of lightning strike !! I&#039;m usisng this router as an access point and I want to connct this to my ADSL modem using DHCP. Without wan port only option is use wireless DHCP which is not supported by my ADSL modem ans I don&#039;t like to configure <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I saw way to convert LAN 1 port as a WAN port in this post <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16148">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16148</a></p><p>But when I check my&nbsp; configuration file (which was&nbsp; etc/config/network) my default VLAN settings are little bit differ form what was mentioned in the forum post. I have no idea how to do this using VLAN</p><p>This is my default configuration file </p><br /><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.115&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;1 2 3 4 5t&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 5t&#039;</p><p>Both my LAN3 and WAN port are dead !! Now I want to use my LAN1 Port as a my WAN port. Is it possible to do this with VLAN? someone please tell me what are the changes should I do this configuration file </p><p>And one more question. If i managed to convert my lan1 as a wan port is it get all the functionally that regular wan port had ? </p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Logical switch port 0 is wired to the &quot;WAN&quot; hardware port (dead).&nbsp; So you only need to change the last part which configures VLAN #2 to use a different physical port, and take that port out of VLAN #1.</p><p>For example to plug the modem into hardware port 4 you would have </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;
    option vlan &#039;1&#039;
    option ports &#039;1 2 5t&#039;

config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;
    option vlan &#039;2&#039;
    option ports &#039;4 5t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Note I took port 3 out of VLAN 1 as well since you said that hardware is also burned out.&nbsp; There&#039;s usually no harm in leaving it in.</p><p>This will make the router work exactly the same as before other than where you plug the cables in.&nbsp; The wan network to the modem is still eth0.2.&nbsp; If you deleted the wan network entirely to use the router as an access point, you will need to recreate it, or reset configuration to defaults which include a wan and then change the VLAN settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 10 May 2015, 21:12)</p>
