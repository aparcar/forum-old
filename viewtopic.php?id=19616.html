					<p>Where can I download tjtagspi tool useful for unbricking via JTAG these strange Atheros-based routers with SPI flash ICs?</p><p>Usual JTAG tools are pretty useless for SPI flashes but there is some tool exists named tjtagspi. Earlier there was link wiki.openwrt.org/yoonix and as I can understand this tool was available at this link. Now wiki has changed and this page no longer exists (i.e. 404 error). Maybe someone still haves this tool? This tool seems to be pretty useful to have.</p><p>More details: file name was jtagspi.0.1.tgz<br />Google cached version of page is: <a href="http://209.85.129.132/search?q=cache:6SjHPamfQiEJ:wiki.openwrt.org/yoonix+jtagspi.0.1.tgz&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ru&amp;client=firefox-a">http://209.85.129.132/search?q=cache:6S … =firefox-a</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Drone</strong> on 1 Apr 2009, 23:29)</p>

Then you have to deal with CPU via JTAG definitely due to lack of working software in system. And with SPI flashes that&#039;s a bit tricky. So, thank you very much for your tools. They can save a day!</p><p>As for me I was frustrated by such clueless wiki messing-up...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Drone</strong> on 22 Jun 2009, 23:19)</p>

					<p>I still don&#039;t blame anyone. The wiki is given to us for free. When I am using free service, I am always grateful. </p><p>Especially if the site is not bombarded with ads like Google/Yahoo.</p>									</div>
