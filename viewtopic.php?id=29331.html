					<p>Have no fear. I am sitting right next to a WRT54G v3.1 that I flashed with the latest 10.03 Backfire release with no problems. On second thought, some fear is good because it will make sure you are paying close attention.</p><p>Following the instructions here can be a challenge, I have found. The OpenWrt project has grown to support many platforms over time (although I&#039;ve only recently registered on the forum here I&#039;ve been using OpenWrt since the transition from WhiteRussian to Kamikaze) and keeping the wiki up to date is daunting. I suspect most people (myself included) get their routers up and running and then don&#039;t come back to share their experience. I&#039;m trying to fix that lapse right now.</p><p>Here is what I did to get my router flashed:</p><p>(1) Visit the Linksys table of hardware to confirm what model you have (some WRT models will not work). The current table lives at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#linksys">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#linksys</a> , but the links on that page for the devices are broken. The old wiki still has good information for this model: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/linksys/wrt54g">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … sys/wrt54g</a> (Sounds like maybe you did this already since you know you have a v3 WRT54G.)</p><p>(2) The key to knowing what image you use is in the table of hardware (TOH). Note, in particular, that your model can use either of two &quot;targets&quot;: brcm-2.4 or brcm47xx (from the current TOH). Now you can navigate the downloads directory:</p><p>&nbsp; (2a) start here for the backfire 10.03 release: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/</a><br />&nbsp; (2b) you can use either brcm-2.4 or brcm47xx; I use brcm-2.4, so I know it works. Try that first.<br />&nbsp; (2c) you need a .bin file for a first flash (see here for why, and why you only need .trx after the first flash: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/linksys#how.do.i.convert.a.bin.image.to.trx.to.use.with.mtd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq/linksys … e.with.mtd</a> ). For your model, download the &quot;openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin&quot;. All of the other .bin files are for other models.</p><p>(3) check the md5 signature of the file you&#039;ve got with the md5sums listed in the downloads directory to be sure nothing got corrupted during download (this also makes doubly sure you&#039;re using the right image before you flash)</p><p>(4) if you haven&#039;t already done so, connect your computer *directly* to the router using an *ethernet cable* (no hubs or routers or other points of failure in between, thank you)</p><p>(5) visit the router&#039;s firmware upgrade page and load in the .bin image you downloaded and double-checked</p><p>(6) submit that form and do not interrupt the flashing process (keep your pets and toddlers away from those power strips and ethernet cables and cross your fingers for no power outages)</p><p>(7) welcome to OpenWrt! I suggest continuing from here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config</a></p><p>Other helpful links:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#uci.configuration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#uci.configuration</a> (skim all of the sections and go in depth on configurations relevant to you)<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/faq</a></p><p>-Matt</p><p>P.S. I wrote this out from (recent) memory. Please let me know if you find any missing details and I&#039;ll update.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWRT went in just fine with these instructions. All I have to do now is configure it as a bridge to another router without losing network access to the unit completely - there&#039;s another opportunity to brick it!</p>									</div>

					<p>Great to hear it worked for you.&nbsp; There are instructions for configuring it as a bridge on the page listing documentation above (under &quot;Recipes&quot;):</p><p>&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap</a></p><p>This &quot;recipe&quot; appears to be for a specific hardware configuration, so you&#039;ll want to read the documentation on the network and wireless config files and be sure you understand what all of the lines in the file are doing before you apply them to your router. You will likely need to modify the settings to fit your network. Although none of these steps have the potential to actually brick the router, it could become difficult to get back into the shell if you don&#039;t remember the IP address.&nbsp; Be sure you keep track of what you use as the static IP address in the lan interface (and your root password!) and you should always be able to get back in.</p><p>Post again if you have any questions!</p>									</div>
