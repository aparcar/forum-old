					<p>Hello..<br />I just installed openwrt RC.6 on my tplink WR1043ND.<br />i can setup wireless client conneting to hotpsot1 using the internal wireless from tplink, and also i plug usb wireless dongle and setup wireless client connecting to hotspot2.<br />both wireless client connected, i want to share again to lan port or access point router from tplink. <br />i didn&#039;t use multiwan for the moment. i just create 2 radio. 1st radio become wireless client to hotspot1 &amp; access point (sharing to my home), and 2nd radio (usb wireless dongle) become wireless client connect to hotspot2. both hotspot1 &amp; hotspot2 using dhcp and get the same class of ip address (192.168.1.x).<br />the questions is, how to configure those connections so that if 1 hotspot broken, it will be redirect to 2nd hotspot and vice versa.<br />with my configuration, traffic always come from hotspot1, but when i access <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> from web, it&#039;s show the router web from hotspot2. what&#039;s wrong ? why traffic come from hotspot1, but the router page is from hotspot2 ? could it be, because both hotspot1 &amp; 2 using same gateway &amp; ip&#039;s class ?</p>									</div>
