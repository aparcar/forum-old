					<p>After not succeeding to make a reliable router from the neoware computer, i&#039;ve decided to move to another computer, this time the fastest that i have.<br />It&#039;s a HP DX2300 with E2160 as CPU with 1GB Ram. And of course, SATA.</p><p>I&#039;ve dd-ed the kamikaze 809 x86 ext2 file to my hdd and trying to boot it. No luck. The last thing it says is <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ne2k-pci.c:v1.03 9/22/2003 D. Becker/P. Gortmaker</code></pre></div><p>..and it stays like that. </p><p>I&#039;ve tryed to deactivate onboard sound and lan but the error remains. </p><p>Any suggestion ? <br />Or, i have to ask, anyone happy with this software on x86 ? If yes, what computer and what version ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Found the problem. I&#039;ve used a usb keyboard. And for some reason, doesn&#039;t work. One old keyboard on ps2 worked. <br />Now i have to find 2 lan cards that work with OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
