					<p>Hi all.</p><p>As mentionned in this tutorial <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=31794#p31794">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=31794#p31794</a> , to create packages, you create a Makefile for it specifying a few variables and the buildroot-ng tree should take it from there.</p><p>But, do I absolutely have to make my package sources be downloaded to be built under buildroot-ng or can I put them somewhere in the buildroot-ng tree and somehow convince it to look for them there?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Stanislas</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s no requirement that the sources have to be downloaded, and indeed there are a few packages already in OpenWrt that include sources in the packages directory. All you need to do is define your Build/Prepare rule to extract or copy the sources to $(PKG_BUILD_DIR); see the mtd package for an example.</p>									</div>
