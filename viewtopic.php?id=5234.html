					<p>I&#039;d like to setup tcpdump to show only the packets that are originating on my router, or are destined for my router.&nbsp; Barring that, I&#039;d like to get a list of the ports that are being used for NAT clients.</p><p>Is there anything like that available?&nbsp; I tried tcpdump -i vlan1 host &lt;public ip address&gt; but I get all the traffic from clients behind the firewall as well.&nbsp; I just want to see if anything is targeting my router.</p><p>Is there something that will dump a list of the NAT port-forwarding that&#039;s going on?&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean the stuff in iptables, I mean the ad-hoc connections that are created when a client on br0 connects to something on vlan1.</p>									</div>
