					<p>This is a sort of re-post in the effort of keeping the discussion on-focus...</p><p>I&#039;m looking for an economical access point or router (currently being produced/sold) which has the ability to operate two entirely separate networks at 2.4 and 5 GHz. I need 802.11g at 2.4 GHz and 802.11a at 5 GHz. OpenWRT compatibility is important, obviously, or I&#039;d not be asking here, but I also don&#039;t need any fancy functionality.</p><p>I don&#039;t require a huge amount of power output, but good sensitivity is important. This probably means an Atheros chipset. I&#039;m looking for something pretty inexpensive as here, around $100 or less online retail price. I know I could toss something together with a board, miniPCI cards, etc. but the cost quickly goes over $100.</p><p>I&#039;m really looking for just the board, I don&#039;t care about the enclosure, antennas, etc. It would be extra nice if the system had an extra PCI slot, or USB, but such things are not so crucial.</p><p>I&#039;ve been looking around and there&#039;s such a profusion of routers hardware out there and my needs are so specific, I was hoping some OpenWRT users might be able to direct me to some hardware or at least some directions to explore.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I would suggest a PCEngines&#039; ALIX-Board as a foundation. I have them in several configurations indoor and outdoor here. Seems to be some reliable piece of hardware IMHO - you can have them in several flavours from 1-LAN + 2 minipci to 3-LAN + 1 minipci.</p><p>Would be ~ 150 $ for a complete indoor setup, though.</p><p>But otherwise you have full flexibility with regard to WLAN-minipci-cards to deploy (a or g or n, easy to replace in future) , USB and a decent amount of RAM and flash (CF). And it&#039;s x86, if that&#039;s a point for you. </p><p>HTH<br />lao</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lawandorder</strong> on 23 Feb 2009, 14:29)</p>

					<p>Yapoo: The Wiligear is too expensive (and I could assemble my own for less), but the WHR-HP-AG108 looks very interesting. I can&#039;t find recieve sensitivity specifications, however.

					<p>are you talking about for the whole thing to be under $100? just two radio cards will probably exceed that price range.</p>									</div>

					<p>xxiao: the WHR-HP-AG108 is under $100. The SparkLAN WX7800-A is under $100. There&#039;s tons of gear out there which hits this price point. There&#039;s also really cheap 802.11g and 802.11a cards out there, but no boards with enough slots cheap enough to make it hit my price point.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if I was clear or not, but my point is not to ask &quot;How can I make something that does this?&quot; but to ask &quot;What stuff is out there which is integrated enough to get me into the price range I want?&quot; The problem is that browsing the HCL means reviewing potentially hundreds of models to see which, if any, can do what I want. And then for each dual band model, I have to investigate if it&#039;s concurrent, etc. </p><p>The point of my question is just to ask for insight from people who know, and perhaps to identify things I might have missed.</p>									</div>

					<p>As I&#039;ve mentioned in your nearly identical thread, the Netgear WNDR3300 is exactly what you have asked for... and Wal-Mart sells it shipped for under $100.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10104837&amp;sourceid=1500000000000003142050&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=10104837">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product. … u=10104837</a></p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Netgear/WNDR3300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … r/WNDR3300</a></p><p>I reported how I flashed OpenWRT on it without much effort.&nbsp; <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=81375">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=81375</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoundSparrow</strong> on 25 Feb 2009, 18:46)</p>

					<p>RoundSparrow: Yes, this is very useful. I didn&#039;t know about the WNDR3300! Do we have any data on the receive sensitivity on this device or transmit power? I&#039;m also a little concerned about the lack of antenna connectors for tweaking around with antennas, but it may work just fine. I wish I knew more about why it has &quot;8 antennas&quot; onboard. </p><p>The WNDR3300 is a great example of why I&#039;m asking on the forum. The wiki still reports it is &quot;untested&quot; but clearly RoundSparrow has tested it!</p><p>Xxiao: I can&#039;t find any data on the WHR-HP-AP108&#039;s rx sensitivity, and availability seems extremely sparse. Plus, like RoundSparrow pointed out, the WNDR3300 is around the same price, is way more available, and has 802.11n! As for the WX7800-A, the port is not done, you have to netboot OpenWRT still.</p><p>In any case, thanks for the information everybody, this thread is proving quite productive, each device has pros and cons and I want to continue to look at as many as possible.</p>									</div>
