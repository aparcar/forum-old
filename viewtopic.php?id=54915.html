					<p>Hi everyone,<br />I&#039;m owner of an old Netgear 834g and I want to buy a new router. I&#039;m interested on these two routers: WNDR4300 and WNDR3700. I read here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a> that both share the same PCB and the only difference is that the first is 3T3R while the second is 2T2R. However, the routers available on retailers are WNDR4300 v2 and WNDR3700 v5 while the current openWRT version 14.07 supports only models up to WNDR4300 v2 and WNDR3700 v4. Do you have any information about the hardware of these new versions? In the future, is openWRT planning to support also these new versions? What do you suggest?<br />Thank you</p>									</div>

While there is no difference between wndr3700v5 and wndr3700v4 excluding the case dimensions. So the chip should be the same. What do you think?</p>									</div>

					<p>In theory, these are easily supported because there are minimal differences from the earlier versions (wndr3700 v5 and v4 are virtually the same, as are wndr4300 v1 and v2), but someone has to actually develop/submit the code to the devs and/or send a board to the devs for them to do it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the problem of the manufacturers releasing new versions of the same model with slightly or even significantly differing hardware is all too common. In some cases, the hardware can be completely different. That&#039;s the case with wndr3700 v3 which was totally different, but luckily v4 &amp; v5 are similar to each other, but different from v1 &amp; v2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 4 Apr 2015, 19:27)</p>
