					<p>I found this board on aliexpress. It looks decent compared to spending $200+ on a higher end router. Does anyone have this board? If so, how is the performance and WiFi coverage? Is it compatible with DESIGNATED DRIVER?</p><p><a href="https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32382460744.html">https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32382460744.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kgoerbig</strong> on 15 Jan 2017, 22:27)</p>

					<p>Mt7621 is a nice MIPS platform, if you are interested in it, better get the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/zbt-WG3526-mt7621-chipset-openwrt-5-gigabit-port-11ac-dual-band-wireless-router-support-3g-4g/1727367_32702493930.html">ZBT WG3526</a> (should have a 2,4 GHz radio that performs better compared to its first generation).</p><p>The D-Link DIR-860L B1 is nice as well, same platform, but the first generation 2,4 GHz ratio, which might perform bad in noisy environments. I am using the D-Link myself. Very happy with it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Borromini</strong> on 16 Jan 2017, 00:12)</p>

					<p>That board is overpriced by far, you&#039;re going to be much better off with the Netgear X4S running LEDE trunk in that price range.</p>									</div>
