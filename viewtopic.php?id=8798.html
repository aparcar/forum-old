					<p>Just a generic question from a toolchain newb.</p><p>How does one keep the configure script from picking up relevant parameters not from the target enviornment but from the build environment.</p><p>Even though I&#039;ve been able to manually hack around the various things that are different and get my packages to run after being built, it sure does look like the results of various &quot;is this installed on this system&quot; tests are pertinent to the build host.</p><p>Could anyone provide a bit of clue?</p>									</div>
