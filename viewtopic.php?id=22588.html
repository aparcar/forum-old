					<p>I was going to install WebIf on a new install of 8.09.1 (2.4 kernel) on my WRT54G and was following the X-Wrt instructions to uninstall LuCI and got to this point...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg remove -recursive luci-*</code></pre></div><p>...and opkg just hung and never returned.

					<p>It is generally better to install an image directly from X-Wrt.org. Uninstalling LuCI with opkg will just mark it as removed but not actually free any space.<br />Also each time you reset your firmware image, LuCI will be active again and X-Wrt is gone - so use an image with X-Wrt embedded in the rom part.</p><p>You can switch the image while keeping your configuration by using &quot;sysupgrade&quot; .</p><p>Regards,<br />JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. I may well do that in future. I&#039;d already installed 8.09.1 before I realised that X-Wrt had a full install set prebuilt.</p><p>For now I&#039;ll stick with LuCI as adding simple firewall rules is available from there.</p>									</div>
