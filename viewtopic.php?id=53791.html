					<p>Hi there, I&#039;m trying to debrick my TP-LINK WR1043ND.<br />I soldered a Serial2USB connector and connected via minicom. <br />That works... somehow.<br />The output I get in minicom is:</p><p>&quot;<br />ï¿½</p><p>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Apr 28 2011 - 15:55:09)</p><p>AP83 (ar9100) U-boot 0.0.11<br />DRAM:&nbsp; <br />sri<br />32 MB<br />&quot;</p><p>...repeating until inifinity.<br />INCLUDING that special character at the beginning<br />What puzzles me is that every tutorial says, I should get something like &quot;autobooting in 1 second&quot; at the end. But theres nothing. After a second, though, the textblock is repeated.</p><p>I tried to enter &quot;tpltpltpl&quot; as well as &quot;tpl&quot;&lt;enter&gt;&quot;tpl&quot;&lt;enter&gt;&quot;tpl&quot;...<br />no result.</p><p>Any hints?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frnk</strong> on 3 Nov 2014, 23:23)</p>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;ll answer this myself.</p><p>I did not plug in the 3.3V pin of my soldered serial socket.<br />As soon as i plugged in that pin, the output continued with:<br />&quot;<br />id read 0x100000ff<br />flash size 8MB, sector count = 128<br />Flash:&nbsp; 8 MB<br />Using default environment</p><p>In:&nbsp; &nbsp; serial<br />Out:&nbsp; &nbsp;serial<br />Err:&nbsp; &nbsp;serial<br />Net:&nbsp; &nbsp;ag7100_enet_initialize...<br />No valid address in Flash.

					<p>ok, another answer by myself.</p><p>I now plugged that pin not to 3.3v but to 5v. that made it going!!<br />it booted the bricked firmware, as I - surprised - missed the point to stop the boot process..</p><p>but after a reset I could do that, and continue with the whole reflash, tftp thing....</p><p>PROBLEM SOLVED!!</p><p>(At first, TFTP had maaany time outs, but that was some prblem with tftp service, .. i just wanted to mention)</p>									</div>
