					<p><strong>PLEASE READ</strong> both <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=140797#p140797">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 97#p140797</a> and <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=140623#p140623">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 23#p140623</a> for the most recent Piranha/AAP status update ~ last updated 110808<br />---</p><p>While the Piranha Project already has been around since 2008, I never officially introduced it to the OpenWrt forum yet. With the next generation release v4, I&#039;d herewith like to change this and provide both an introduction and some basic documentation to interested people. Based on the OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 branch, Piranha v4 is released as date-tagged snapshot releases at <a href="http://piranha.pwnz.org/pub/v4/">http://piranha.pwnz.org/pub/v4/</a></p><p>So, what is the Piranha Project? Basically, it consists of two major parts.</p><p>Being an OpenWrt enthusiast myself, I started to write AAP (aka AutoAP) for OpenWrt Kamikaze in 2009. From my very own perspective and usage scenario, the unavailability of AutoAP has been a rather big drawback of the OpenWrt platform at that time. That said, AAP is by no means a fork of AutoAP but a re-write of its functionality from scratch while addressing its design drawbacks and extending its capabilities. Let me take the opportunity to list the major features of AAP in its current release v3 (just to mention a few of them, more detailed information is provided later on), also provided as date-tagged snapshot releases.</p><p>- utilizes OpenWrt Kamikaze Unified Configuration Interface UCI<br />- connects upon BSSID selection of surrounding networks<br />- supports to client connection to OPN, WEP, WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK encrypted networks<br />- is capable to white- and blacklist certain APs<br />- connects to hidden SSIDs and networks with enabled Mac filtering<br />- utilizes Mac Changer to use a random Mac at each connection attempt<br />- logs to syslog and provides a convenient CLI user interface</p><p>And the second part? AAP (currently v3) along with an OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 system pre-configured in station mode with appropriate patches to madwifi, aircrack-ng suite pre-installed, CIFS share capabilities and several custom scripts for your convenience is clutched into a ready-to-use package, the Piranha firmware (currently v4). That said, it&#039;s in general possible to compile your very own OpenWrt distribution with AAP pre-installed, but it&#039;s incomparable more difficult than using the Piranha firmware as is, especially due to its compatibility with (and pre-configuration of) the official OpenWrt repositories.</p><p><strong>Both AAP and the Piranha firmware are an Atheros only development!</strong> While it&#039;s imaginable to port it to other OpenWrt supported platforms as well, I&#039;m currently not planning to do so due to the heavy reliance of AAP on wlanconfig and the opportunities of the madwifi drivers provided for aircrack-ng techniques.</p><p>Some cups of coffee later, I&#039;ll provide some basic documentation for both Piranha v4 and AAP v3 in a subsequent forum post. Stay tuned!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orange</strong> on 8 Aug 2011, 03:54)</p>

					<p>Piranha v4 itself is an OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 system pre-configured in station mode and <strong>provided for Atheros devices only!</strong> Thus, there actually isn&#039;t too much to document from a firmware perspective besides the slight modifications to a default OpenWrt distribution. Piranha is, so to speak, an auto-connecting wireless hacking drone with aircrack-ng and AAP pre-installed while providing some basic functions for users&#039; convenience. That said, this isn&#039;t the right place to showcase OpenWrt and/or the aircrack-ng suite as both of them are very well documented at their respective wikis.</p><p>For an explanation of CIFS share capabilities shipping with Piranha by default, I assume a host system with configured CIFS share &quot;OpenWrt&quot; at 10.0.0.165.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# mkdir /tmp/share<br />root@OpenWrt:~# mount.cifs //10.0.0.165/OpenWrt /tmp/share/ -o user=orange,password=xy<br />root@OpenWrt:~# df -h<br />Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Used Available Use% Mounted on<br />/dev/root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.4M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /rom<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; 152.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.5M&nbsp; &nbsp;2% /tmp<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; 512.0K&nbsp; &nbsp;0% /dev<br />/dev/mtdblock3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; 272.0K&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.3M&nbsp; &nbsp;6% /overlay<br />mini_fo:/overlay&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 100% /<br />//10.0.0.165/OpenWrt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.4G&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.5G&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5G&nbsp; 65% /tmp/share<br />root@OpenWrt:~#</p></blockquote></div><p>Furthermore, Piranha ships with two very simple custom scripts /bin/monitor and /bin/sta to easily switch the operating mode from sta to monitor and vice versa.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# monitor<br />madwifi-ng VAP ath0 destroyed<br />madwifi-ng VAP ath0 created (wlanmode monitor)<br />root@OpenWrt:~# sta<br />madwifi-ng VAP ath0 destroyed<br />madwifi-ng VAP ath0 created (wlanmode sta)<br />root@OpenWrt:~#</p></blockquote></div><p>-----<br />AAP (aka AutoAP) for OpenWrt Kamikaze is an in-house development of the Piranha Project. Its current release v3 is herewith exclusively documented at the OpenWrt forum. That said, AAP v3 consists of a single shell script /bin/aap and its configuration file /etc/config/aap and thus is fully UCI configurable. AAP basically scan for surrounding networks and decides upon SNR and provided white- and blacklisting information to which networks to connect to and in what order (unencrypted networks are used without further configuration by default). Furthermore you can configure hidden SSIDs of certain networks and define valid Mac addresses AAP utilizes upon connection attempts to networks with enabled Mac filtering. AAP obfuscates its existence by using random Mac addresses upon each of its connection attempts. This is achieved with the Mac Changer package as a companion. Furthermore AAP provides various general configuration variables and toggles to adopt its operation to your specific usecase. AAP continuously verifies the connection to the connected AP and switches the network once the connection isn&#039;t alive anymore. To get a better understanding, I paste the default configuration file Piranha v4 ships with.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>config &#039;aap&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;autostart&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;checkfreq&#039; &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dhcptimeout&#039; &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ineturl&#039; &#039;<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;logenable&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;prefonly&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;rescandelay&#039; &#039;43200&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;warndelay&#039; &#039;120&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;watchinet&#039; &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config &#039;00:11:22:33:44:55&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;key&#039; &#039;00010203040506070809101112&#039;</p><p>config &#039;00:22:33:44:55:66&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;fakemac&#039; &#039;00:33:44:55:66:77&#039;</p><p>config &#039;00:44:55:66:77:88&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;default&#039;</p><p>config &#039;00:55:66:77:88:99&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;blst&#039; &#039;1&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p><strong><span style="color: #FF0000">IMPORTANT UPDATE 100903: Due to the behaviour of the busybox built-in grep, it&#039;s very important to leave the dummy bssid sections in /e/c/aap (see above) as is. Please, just append your custom bssid sections (ONE per bssid) to it. Otherwise AAP may fail to properly &quot;calculate&quot; its connection attempt list</span></strong></p><p>As you can see, the configuration file is in general divided into two major parts. A general AAP configuration (please ask if you have questions) and the configuration of the various BSSIDs it connects to.</p><p>- &quot;key&quot; defines the known key of a WEP, WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK encrypted network. You do not need to tell AAP the respective encryption method as it extracts the information automatically out of its scan results<br />- &quot;ssid&quot; tells AAP the known SSID of a hidden network<br />- &quot;blst&quot; is set to &quot;1&quot; if you&#039;d like to blacklist a certain AP<br />- &quot;fakemac&quot; defines a valid client Mac AAP uses upon connection attempt to the configured AP</p><p>If you&#039;d like to define more than just one of the before-mentioned options for a certain AP, you do it within one single UCI section, e.g.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>config &#039;00:11:22:33:44:55&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;key&#039; &#039;00010203040506070809101112&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;fakemac&#039; &#039;00:33:44:55:66:77&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;default&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>Certainly, AAP can be directly configured with the Unified Configuration interface UCI. Let&#039;s assume, you&#039;d like to utilize a BSSID &quot;00:11:22:33:44:55&quot; and configure its key &quot;00010203040506070809101112&quot;, ssid &quot;default&quot; and fakemac &quot;00:22:33:44:55:66&quot; used upon respective connection attempt and store the configuration.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# uci add aap 00:11:22:33:44:55<br />root@OpenWrt:~# uci set aap.@00:11:22:33:44:55[0].key=00010203040506070809101112<br />root@OpenWrt:~# uci set aap.@00:11:22:33:44:55[0].fakemac=00:22:33:44:55:66<br />root@OpenWrt:~# uci set aap.@00:11:22:33:44:55[0].ssid=default<br />root@OpenWrt:~# uci commit aap<br />root@OpenWrt:~#</p></blockquote></div><p>While I could write a really thick &quot;novel&quot; about AAP, I try to ensure readability and thus just cover the basics (please ask if you have further questions not explained here in detail due to space and time requirements). That all said, AAP is controlled by an easy-to-use CLI interface, providing the following functions</p><p>- enable, disable the autostart of AAP<br />- manually start, stop and restart it<br />- output the syslog messages of AAP (to verify its proper operation)<br />- manually skip the connection to the current network and connect to the next one in its result list<br />- access the connection attempt list of networks AAP connects to in descending order of scanned SNR</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>root@OpenWrt:~# aap</p><p>&nbsp; AAP v3 100813 - (C) 2009, 2010 by orange<br />&nbsp; <a href="http://piranha.pwnz.org">http://piranha.pwnz.org</a></p><p>&nbsp; usage: aap [enable,disable,list,log,skip,restart,start,stop]</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~#</p></blockquote></div><p>All that said, I hope you&#039;ll enjoy Piranha v4 and AAP v3 and have a lot of fun with it! For Piranha v4 installations instructions, please have a look at the respective OpenWrt wiki page covering your specific Atheros device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orange</strong> on 3 Sep 2010, 08:49)</p>

I don&#039;t feel it appropriate to provide comprehensive patching/installation and OpenWrt configuration instructions as this would significantly higher both the potential for failure and my very own maintenance overhead in supporting AAP.
