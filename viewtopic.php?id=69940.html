					<p><strong>After googling around:</strong></p><p>&quot;The 50 and 51 you&#039;re referring to aren&#039;t TCP or UDP ports, they&#039;re the IP protocol numbers for ESP and AH, respectively. ESP and AH are layer 4 protocols, on the same level as TCP (IP proto 6) and UDP (IP proto 17).&quot;</p><p>So you were partially correct... They still are not &quot;Protocols&quot;. You really should specify the whole IP and mention they are reserved IP ranges and not protocols... Calling them &quot;protocols&quot; is overly confusing because they are not protocols... They are reserved IP ranges.</p><p><strong>I apologize, there was a clusterfck of misunderstanding going on there..</strong>.</p><p><strong>To OP:</strong><br />Now that I think about it, that suggestion is not going to work, because the IPSec ports are already open, and accepting from all IP addresses. Allowing a specific IP to connect won&#039;t make any more of a difference.</p><p>Try using <a href="http://canyouseeme.org/">http://canyouseeme.org/</a> to ensure your ports are truly open.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mys5droid</strong> on 20 Feb 2017, 22:14)</p>
