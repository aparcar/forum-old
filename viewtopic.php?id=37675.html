					<p>I am unable to connect to the internet following what look like a successful installation of WRT. </p><p>I have been able to determine that the problem is somewhere in the loop/segment between the router to modem to Internet to modem to router. It does not seem to being on any router-LAN segments.</p><p>I am a newbie with router firmware so bear with me and my lack of in-depth knowledge.</p><p>I have currently installed a community build, the &quot;normal&quot; build of Arokh. My router is a WNDR2800 and my modem a TP-LINK 8817.&nbsp; I connect to my ISP via PPoE. Prior to the first install of OpenWRT, I had the stock firmware then DD-WRT then back to stock firmware and finally a downgrade of stock firmware, all working without problems, immediately following flashing without any adjustment needed. I was expected and told that the default of OpenWRT build I use was working out of the box. In my case, it is not, or it is except for Internet connection from the LAN.</p><p>Rather than copy and paste everything back here, I would point you to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />» Community Releases / Announcements<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;» Fully featured OpenWrt build for the WNDR3700<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;» post # 3041 <br />and 8 posts of mine following it to describe the problem and what I did to research it and try to find a fix. </p><p>If it is needed and preferable I will post the details here again. Just let me know what is more appropriate.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I have reached the end of my skill set to solve this promptly and it is even very difficult for me to switch back and forth the modems and router to be able to follow and fix the problem when I need the Internet in the middle of trying to fix it, with the network being not readily accessible.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>EDIT</p><p>I am adding the latest of my discoveries in trying to solve this problem.</p><p>Running ifconfig from the router&nbsp; I get the following</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt /root# ifconfig

Therefore it points to the router not passing the information on to the LAN.&nbsp; The firewall is stock standard, unchanged!&nbsp; What else could be blocking the transmission from the router to the LAN?</p><p>I am getting ip&#039;s from DHCP for the workstations. So, the communication from and to LAN/Router also works.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t it point to the router not forwarding? If I am correct, what could be preventing it?</p><p>Am I completely misunderstanding this?&nbsp; Is there any other info I could give or look at that may give me a better pointer?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MidGe</strong> on 22 Jun 2012, 17:31)</p>

					<p>OK. Got the answer to that one.</p><p>I simply need configure the modem. Open WRT is different from stock firmware and my experience of dd-wrt following the install of stock firmware, in as much as it needs a manual&nbsp; configuration of the modem/router whereas the stock firmware did it itself as part of the install in the case of the models I use.</p><p>I suppose the propensity to assume caught me with my pants down.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
