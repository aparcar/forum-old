You&#039;re never going to get 3200mbps out of the 3200acm.. ever, and that&#039;s on stock or lede/openwrt. </p><p>The way that it breaks down is the 3200acm is a dual band router, and really (shh don&#039;t tell anyone) it is a 1900ac model with a theoretical speed of 600mbps on 2.4 and around 1.3Gbps on 5Ghz band. However supposedly in 160hMhz width it can support something like 3 of those streams at the same time, and once again theoretically bumping that number potentially up to 2.6Gbps&nbsp; Hence why they call it the (3200 = (2.6 + 600)). </p><p>Okay, if I recall you were originally asking about 2.4ghz.&nbsp; Supposedly it&#039;s capable of 600mbps... Well, it&#039;s a bit of a marketing ploy I&#039;m afraid, IMHO. 600mbps will require devices that support 40Mhz widths, which around most places is difficult because of all the channels are crowded anyway.</p><p>Really, I wouldn&#039;t get caught up in the theoretical numbers game. </p><p>Best Regards</p><p>*EDIT*</p><p>Don&#039;t get me wrong.. The 3200 is a bad-a$$ box with lots of CPU power and RAM behind it. I&#039;ve gone from the 1900acV1 through to the 1900acs, and now the 3200acm, and it&#039;s by far the best yet. I think the deal with the 3200acm is that it is a bit before its time which means its going to be future proof.</p></blockquote></div><p>David I totally agree with you, even if I live in a country (Brazil) where officially these two equipments are not sold, so no WARRANTY, and ZERO support, that makes no difference in BRASIL Linksys leaves much to be desired in the matter of support, but even so I opted to buy them, since I had a good experience with WR54, and lastly with an EA6200 that still works today, and look at buying equipment in Brazil and complicated because besides the currency difference (change) we still pay 160% of taxes.</p><p>I really mean the speed stamped in the box of the product, I know in practice and complicated to use, but in other equipment programs like WIFI Explorer Pro, NetSpot Pro always show these speeds, as they do in the EA6200 or Archer C7, and in all other Routers I&#039;ve used, except WRT, Kinksys says that the WRT3200 would be 3200Mbps, but in the applications it only shows 1750 or 1900 Mbps, already in the WRT1900ACS v2 the maximum was 1750 Mbps. Anyway even without using and good to know that this speed would be at the dog could be used. : D</p><p>two other doubts, I saw that they are speaking in kerne 4.XX for p WRT 3200, what would be the advantage of using an older kernel?</p><p>for the WRT line, there is already a more recent WIFI (hardwere) driver than the one we use in your vs. download?</p><p>where could you get this beta version for testing?</p><p>I thank you for your attention and patience, because the language barrier disturbs and confuses the reciocinio of what is written.</p><p>Guedes,</p></blockquote></div><br /><p>I always use the latest wifi driver with every build. Back to wifi, do you have hardware devices that support these extra speeds? For example do you have devices that support 40mhz widths with 2.4Ghz? Also, do you have devices that support tri stream MIMO 160Mhz widths? If you don&#039;t then you will never see a connection with the type of theoretical speeds. </p><p>There are a couple of builds out there that leverage older kernels, and the reason behind I think for this approach is for refinement and honing of the system. The daily snapshots and the builds I upload to the server are considered to be bleeding edge or development. Each build will likely have some issues that need to be addressed. I hope this gives you a better idea of what you are looking for.</p><p>*EDIT*</p><p>As a test I connected my S8 Active to 2.4Ghz, and it connects at 20Mhz or 144Mbps. So, my phone which is pretty recent will never connect to any faster rate as it is not supported with this hardware.&nbsp; I think my iPhones are the same way as well, but would need to verify.&nbsp; On 5Ghz my S8 active connects at 866Mbps which I believe is about maximum for 80Mhz width. There will need to be some tests to see if it can take advantage of 160Mhz or at least connect showing 160Mhz width.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 25 Feb 2018, 18:43)</p>
