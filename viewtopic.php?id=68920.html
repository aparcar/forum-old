					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I&#039;ve just joined these forums to seek some assistance on problems I am having with the combination of my TP-Link Archer C7, OpenWrt, and connectivity to my Xbox One S. I bought the router recently specifically for OpenWrt use, and am using it with an ADSL connection through an unlocked Huawei HG612 modem, and after lots of experimentation and swearing, I eventually got most of it working, however performance has just not been as extreme and reliable as I was expecting.</p><p>Most of my connectivity issues have been on the Wi-Fi front, with the biggest culprit being my Xbox One S, which most of the time completely refuses to connect at all. However, even my Windows PCs have a noticeable delay between turning on and showing connectivity, and looking at the system logs I get the feeling that DHCP is perhaps not distributing addresses as quickly as it maybe should? However the Xbox will attempt to connect to the wireless network, however most of the time the OpenWrt system logs show that the console is not responding to authentication being granted. Unusually, a system reset on the Xbox will normally temporarily fix this, however it really is temporary - eventually Xbox Live will simply disconnect, as if it has almost been kicked off the wireless network. The serial number is pre-215c, so I believe the correct firmware is installed.</p><p>I would really like to get OpenWrt running well for my home network, and I purchased this router based off copious positive feedback online, so I really expect and hope that this will be repairable, and I would really hate to revert it to stock firmware. Thanks for any advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mate if you are ok with flashing beta fermwair you could take a look here:<br /><a href="https://kau.toke.dk/lede/airtime-fairness-builds/ar71xx/generic/">https://kau.toke.dk/lede/airtime-fairne … x/generic/</a><br />The airtime-fairness patch&#039;s that are in this build are from the folks at make WiFi fast.<br /><a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/make-wifi-fast/">https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/make-wifi-fast/</a><br /><a href="http://blog.cerowrt.org/post/make-wifi-fast/">http://blog.cerowrt.org/post/make-wifi-fast/</a><br />But not all packages are available for this build. See here for a list of the ones that are built:<br /><a href="https://kau.toke.dk/lede/airtime-fairness-builds/ar71xx/generic/lede-current-r2449%2B2-c9440d3-ar71xx-generic.manifest">https://kau.toke.dk/lede/airtime-fairne … c.manifest</a><br />If you upgrade to this build you just need to flash the sysupgrade file, but you can&#039;t save settings from your install you have now or you will be in for a lot of strange bugs. I run this build it&#039;s a lot newer than the Openwrt cc 15.1 It&#039;s built on kernel 4.4 I have about 30 devices running off it. I use it as a dumb AP for 2.4 and 5 GHZ. If you give this a go and need help I will try and help if i can but i am not a expert. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Ps I don&#039;t think these builds will get updated now as the dude who rote the patches is pushed them to the LEDE codebase. As far as i know!</p>									</div>
