					<p>From what I understand, the linked advice is about configuring the firewall of the local machine, not the router? I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s not the issue, as everything works correctly when I connect everything through wired LAN. Also, I have devices on the network, e.g. an Xbox 360 and a Chromebox with OpenElec, whose firewall is not supposed to be configured. On Wifi, they can&#039;t even see each other, nor can they see any other DLNA device on the network. On wired lan, everything works as expected.</p><p>I think this is definitely an issue with the router itself, OpenWRT or some component it uses (I have the same issue with DD-WRT too).</p>									</div>

					<p>That sounds pretty much the same issue I was having, however reverting to an earlier release resolved the problem for me, which is consistent with the bug report the OP cited. <br />I had no luck with the iptables fix and in theory, it shouldn&#039;t make any difference anyway as the below sysctl settings should ensure firewalling is disabled on the bridge network;</p><p>net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0<br />net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0<br />net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0</p><p>I can&#039;t check currently, but would be interesting to see if the above are set correctly on the releases with issues and whether there are any additional tuneables in /proc/sys/net/bridge/ that might be relevant. While I can&#039;t be positive, it seems the issue is more kernel related than anything else</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m also surprised that the bug linked above doesn&#039;t get any traction. Surely it doesn&#039;t kill just Chromecast, but a lot of other self-discovering media devices on 15.05 release.</p>									</div>

					<p>The OP had issues with a DLNA device, so it&#039;s not chromecast specific and hopefully not just use either.

					<p>Same here, the Chromecast issues are with Archer C7v2. Could it be somewhere in the device driver/firmware of that specific router which breaks stuff? </p><p>Not sure which firmware for the radio was included with 15.05, I&#039;ve been using my own images with firmware-4.bin_10.2.4.48 instead.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the firmware is only used by the 5Ghz (ath10k) radio, the 2.4Ghz doesn&#039;t need a firmware file, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s related. That said, I did upgrade mine to 10.2.4.70.9-2 and that&#039;s currently working fine. I think I tried the same thing on the non-working later build which didn&#039;t help. Given I can see the multicast packets getting from my iPad to the router, it also suggests the problem is elsewhere</p><p>Unfortunately I&#039;ve no idea where, I&#039;ve gone through all the commits between my working build and non-working builds and see nothing obvious, although the kernel&#039;s gone from 4.1.3 to 4.1.10.</p><p>The only other think I&#039;ve noted is that the OPs WDR3600 and our archer C7s don&#039;t share the same Radios, but do share the same switch, which might be another area to look at, but totally out of my area of experience</p><p>Of course, as I&#039;ve got a working build I could just leave it as is and not touch it, but I&#039;m interested in the problem now :S</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m currently running the firmware-5.bin on what I guess is essentially CC, however I built from source so the revision is somewhere between rc3 and final release.

					<p>Couple of days ago I started update of my d-link DIR-825 to latest trunk.<br />I run this router as pure AP. Just one bridge&nbsp; wireless-lan-wan.<br />I found several problems with IPV6. IPV6 does not use ARP but&nbsp; a number of ICMP6 multicast messages.<br />Main messages are : neighbor solicitation/neighbor advertisement and router solicitation/router advertisements.<br />In default setup I found that those ICMPs are not passing the bridge well, and also router itself does not accept RAs and also does not receive ipv6 address.<br />The first problem caused by<br />/sys/devices/virtual/net/br-lan/bridge/multicast_querier=1<br />/sys/devices/virtual/net/br-lan/bridge/igmp_snooping=1<br />which are different from barrier breaker, where they are =0.<br />/etc/config/network :<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;

        option multicast_querier &#039;0&#039;
        option igmp_snooping &#039;0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>RAs are not accepted because forwarding is set to 1. Forwarding is not needed in my setup.<br />/etc/sysctl.conf:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>......
net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=0
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=0
......</code></pre></div><p>And that&#039;s not all !<br />I&#039;ve spent lots of time to find that many ralink based wifi adapters in some cases do not receive multicast messages of ICMPv6 and miss solicitation requests !<br />First time after connection to AP from windows all goes well. But if manually disconnect from the AP and then reconnect, clear neighbor cache and try to ping windows station from openwrt - it fails. tcpdump reveals that solicitations are passing to the wireless interface, but they are not received by ralink adapter as seen in wireshark on windows host !<br />What I did next : I removed encryption from AP and set up monitoring wireshark on different computer to find what is going on in the air.&nbsp; Monitoring host sees solicitations send from the AP in the air but ralink does not receive them !<br />Only restarting of windows driver help for one session, any subsequent sessions reproduce the same behavior.<br />And everything is OK if throw ralink away and replace it with atheros based NIC !</p><p>As a result :</p><p>1) Broadcast/multicast problems can be caused by mentioned above &quot;sys&quot; values<br />2) Some client wifi adapter drivers are buggy and also can have problems with broadcast/multicast</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 22 Oct 2015, 19:47)</p>
