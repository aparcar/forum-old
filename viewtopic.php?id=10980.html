					<p>Hi<br />I have heard a lot about OpenWrt and therefore I bought a new router model WRT54GS vers. 6 and have installed it on my local network today. I have also updated the Linksys firmware from 1.50.0 to the latest 1.52.0. And everything seems to work very fine uptil now :-)<br />Now I would like to make this router version 6 into a lot more :), but....</p><p>I can not find any specific alternative firmaware to my router version !</p><p>Question is therefore:<br />Can any of you help me with some links to firmware and manuels to my router version ?<br />And also some help about any problems with the alternative firmware updates you tell me about ?</p><p>The whole &quot;thing&quot; has one purpose - getting rid of software firewalls like the one I use right now:<br />ZoneAlarm Security Suite incl. antivirus and all that.<br />This software simple kills my old AMD 1800+ with 1 GB Ram inside.<br />So my plan is the get a hardware firewall that I can fully control and a good antivirus software.<br />I could ofcourse bay a new computer but here in Denmark we change all TV signals and thing like that to digital in the year 2009, so I would like to vait until 2009 before I invest a lot of money in 3-4 new computers with mediacenter og home server plus mayby 1Gb network.</p><p>Now you all know why I asking for some help, so if the day have been nice until now let us hope the day continue to be nice...</p><p>Bear</p>									</div>

					<p>If I were you, I&#039;d return that router and get something like a WRT54GL from NewEgg, Amazon, etc.&nbsp; They are $52US - $62US depending upon rebate.</p><p>The version 6 is only partially supported by OpenWRT and worse, only has 2MB of flash.&nbsp; That&#039;s enough to run OpenWRT, but I don&#039;t think you can add much if anything at all. (I&#039;ve never used one, but the FAQ says 2MB will leave you pretty cramped.)</p><p>The WRT54GL (note that the &#039;L&#039; is important) has 4MB flash and 16MB ram and works very nicely.&nbsp; It leaves a good amount of room to add software,</p><p>Plus, by buying the GL you are voting with your wallet for the Linux based units over the later VxWorks based units.</p><p>Whatever you do, have fun!</p><p>More info about WRT54GS support here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GS">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ys/WRT54GS</a></p><p>-Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Steve</p><p>Ths for you help. I can see now that the advise I got from someone here in Denmark had a lot of missing informations about the different versions:</p><p>Flash memory<br />Ram<br />and supported alternative software</p><p>So I shall have a new version as it looks at this moment <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Bear</p>									</div>

					<p>Believe me, the sheer OpenWRT coolness you will experience after you find the right router will more than make up for the initial frustration.</p><p>That said, I&#039;d do some research in the forums search about just what it might take to do the virus scanning you are talking about.&nbsp; I&#039;m not certain that the WRT54GL would be up to it.&nbsp; However, something like the WRTSL54GS, which is about 99USD, has 8MB flash and 32MB ram.&nbsp; Plus a USB port so that you can have a swap partition and plenty of disk space. (From a small usb fob to a, say, a terabyte RAID array. (I think it will do RAID.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t actually tried.)</p><p>I&#039;m finding that the wireless range on my WRTSL54GS is awful, though.&nbsp; However, Vincent has several of them and says the range is fine, so mine might be defective.</p><p>-Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Steve</p><p>I think my bad english have made a misunderstanding. I know that I write to fast sometimes and my english is not that good. The main reason for that is, that I´m a dane born and live in Denmark ;-)</p><p>And now to the more serious stuff:</p><p>My idea was to separate Firewall and antivirus when getting a not to expency hardware firewall in a Linksys router updated with an alternative firmware that provide the router with a good firewall setup and a firewall we can work with as we need.</p><p>I think that if I use a AVG Pro antivirus, then the virus and spyware problem is solved and that software do not use a lot of ram when protecting my computer online.<br />I have just bought a 2-year license to ZoneAlarm Security Suite and I hoped that the software would solve the whole problem, but it slow down the computer a lot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> </p><p>And you say that you have a WRTSL54GS with a lot of memory plus the extras and that sounds good.</p><p>The problem with the wireless range is not very important for me - not in this year or next year anyway. Because I normally turn off the wireless system in my routers connected to my cabelmodem. I use (right now) a Belkin accesspoint as my wireless system and that accesspoint is connected to my router with a cable. I have made a small closet on the wall close to my main computer to all my networks items (cablemodem, switch, router and USB printserver). So therefore I have and accesspoint placed another place in the middle of our house <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />(I hope that the Belkin accesspoint will work together with my new Linksys router with alternative firmware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>But another thing is, that I can not find the model you talk about when I search for it here in Denmark. So if I buy the model you talk about do you know or think that model/type will work in Europe/Denmark?</p><p>Bjorn</p>									</div>
