					<p>Some good news:</p><p>I found that the problem for the cpufreq stats and remaining options not being exported on the &quot;/sys/devices/system/...&quot; path was due to a bad regulator description on the DT for the K4.1 and K4.4.7.<br />After correcting this on K4.1 and testing again, I finally have cpufreq exporting successful all the information as it should be. Also, now I am entirely sure that my processor is running at the right frequency, according to the governor policy chosen.</p><p>Solved this problem and after doing some more Eth1Gb and 11ac network tests on this image, I found that the throughput has also improved which means that the difference seen before between K3.18 and K4.1 was related with the regulator...</p><p>So, the current status is</p><p><strong>Ethernet 1Gb:</strong><br /><em>(iperf -s on router; average on 60s):</em><br />OEM Image&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--- 903 Mbits/sec<br />CustomK3.18&nbsp; &nbsp;--- 930 Mbits/sec<br />CustomK4.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--- 930 Mbits/sec</p><p><em>(iperf -c on router; average on 60s):</em><br />OEM Image&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--- 711 Mbits/sec<br />CustomK3.18&nbsp; &nbsp;--- 889 Mbits/sec<br />CustomK4.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--- 900 Mbits/sec</p><p>So, on the Ethernet, things seem to be more consistent now (regarding TCP test only!).

At that time and after spending some time to realize why things were different in my local openwrt directory (for instance, linux kernel 4.1 was not present anymore and instead of it, there was support for k4.4.14, among many other changes), I discover that there is an huge difference on using &quot;git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git&quot; (which leads to my current image) and &quot;git clone <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git&quot;</a> (which leads to what seems to be the latest branch state). I don&#039;t know if this behavior is desired/normal or if it is happening due to an mistake in the git pointers.<br />What I noticed is that the image based on k4.4.14 seems to have the cpufreq working again, so there should be an patch already doing the job (although for example the USB is not working for my hardware). In my case, since by now, I need to put things working with this particular version (k4.1) due to other software components, I have to try to solve all the problems manually (cpufreq was one of them). Later when this linux kernel version is full working, I will spend time trying to update the linux kernel to k4.4.x.</p><p>My hardware, as already described in initial posts of this thread, is based on the AP148 board and uses an IPQ8064 processor from Qualcomm. I think it is not available to general customer market, although it could be possible to acquire it from Qualcomm directly in special conditions (e.g. NDA agreement and for developing products purposes).<br />So, depending on which command people use to clone the openwrt project and their target hardware, the cpufreq could be already working without any problems.<br />But if necessary and useful, I can send an patch without any problems, just let me know.</p><p>Kind regards</p>									</div>

This also happens on the 11ac interface.<br />I know that I am setting the bandwidth a little above of the real maximum ethernet capability but that is intentional to stress the connection. Also, I am aware that UDP does not implement congestion or traffic flow mechanisms (and others), reason why I would expect to have some error.<br />But is it normal to have that huge increase/decrease in error (aka lost datagrams) between consecutive tests?<br />Has anyone else done similar tests with UDP, that can comment on this behavior and on these metrics, so I can have an idea if they are acceptable?</p><p>I suspect that I can improve this throughput changing the queue/network scheduling policy but when I tried to change it to PRIO on my custom K4.1 image, I didn&#039;t see any improvements or anything that shows that the policy is working.

Is this normal?<br />Does it depend on some selection?<br />Is there some tutorial or easy way to setup these network schedulers without much effort to check which ones perform better or do I have to test them individually? In this last case, anyone can suggest a good recipe to test them individually without depending too much on their specific parameters (my intention is to have an quick and overall idea of their general performance and only then, spend time tuning the most promising ones)?</p><p>Kind regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sjuliao</strong> on 10 Oct 2016, 18:41)</p>
