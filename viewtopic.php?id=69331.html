					<p>While this should work in general, trying to push 802.11ac -and USB even less- through the CPU of your WL-500GP v2 is probably pushing your luck a bit too far (you&#039;re limited by the 100 MBit/s ethernet ports to begin with, but USB storage on routers of those specifications, with USB being quite CPU intensive, was typically limited to around 2.0-2.5 MByte/s, this is probably a very similar constraint for a wlan card, with wlan being rather timing sensitive, it might be that your router CPU is already overwhelmed with pushing management frames alone).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 11 Jan 2017, 15:02)</p>

					<p>Thanks for your answer. I Understand. <br />I&#039;m not plan it for heavy use like fast internet connection through ac. only for stream mp3 music from storage to phone, but the built-in wlan have only b and g, even not n, with very limited range. </p><p>But it seems like the router not recognize properly the adapter as wlan interface. i don&#039;t see the adapter nowhere, only in lsusb but not anywhere besides. </p><p>My question is simple, what is the procedure for install usb wifi adapter? (what to write and where, etc). i dont know how to do that.</p><p>(I&#039;m sorry about my bad english, isn&#039;t my native language).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nachum37</strong> on 12 Jan 2017, 00:44)</p>
