					<p>I would also like to know if it is supported, as I am planning on buying an XAC1200. I would imagine the firmware/OS would be quite similar, if not the same, although I&#039;m not sure if it would be compatible with the APM103 modem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I really interest, too, to replace the firmware of XAC1200.<br />This modem / router based on EA1200 router and specific power supply.</p><p>Apparently, we can use the Belkin Middlware for Power Modem firmware for the power supply modem and the openwrt EA6200 firmware for the router.<br />It&#039;s maybe possible to parameter modem by ssh command with the modem ip (172.16.0.2)...</p><p>but i&#039;m newbie and i don&#039;t know what I can do to flash and to parameter this modem / router...<br />Thank for your help</p>									</div>
