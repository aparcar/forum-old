					<p>Today i bought a TP-Link TL-WR810N (EU) ver 2.0 and tried to compile an openwrt-version. My problem is that openwrt only supports Version EU-1.1. Does somebody know when there is a build for 2.0 is possible?</p><p>With version 1.0 i got the message: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgrade file was inccorect. Please check the file name</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
