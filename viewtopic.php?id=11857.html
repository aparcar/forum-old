					<p><a href="http://oh-god.com/a335/">http://oh-god.com/a335/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;----- diagram of concept</p><p>What I am trying to right now is understand if it is possible to make a Meraki mini<br />( meraki.com ) act in the following way :&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />( I don&#039;t know the proper nomenclature, and I apologize for that<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;... part of what I am trying to learn)</p><p>I want the Meraki to appear as a fixed IP address webserver to a device accessing it via wireless 802.11b/g.<br />Let&#039;s say I have an iPhone.&nbsp; I instruct the iPhone to log onto a wireless network ( provided by the Meraki )<br />with an SSID of &quot;meraki&quot;.&nbsp; The security is WEP or WAP or ????.&nbsp; ( I don&#039;t care about the security aspect at present.&nbsp; That will come later. )</p><p>The iPhone connects wirelessly to the network.&nbsp; Now the iPhone is instructed to access either a local IP or Global IP <a href="http://www.xxx.yyy.zzz">www.xxx.yyy.zzz</a> .</p><p>The IP <a href="http://www.xxx.yyy.zzz">www.xxx.yyy.zzz</a> addresses the Meraki.<br />The Linux running on the Meraki directs this request to a Webserver running on the Meraki which offers up HTML created by a Ruby script or by a PERL script.&nbsp; The Webserver accesses the outside world using a LLSP ( low level serial port ) to a PSOC processor.&nbsp; The PSOC allows the webserver to control external devices and gather data.&nbsp; ( For example: in a car you could access car status, start the car, unlock the door, etc. )&nbsp; I am comfortable with the PSOC part of the project.&nbsp; &nbsp;( <a href="http://www.cypress.com/psoc">http://www.cypress.com/psoc</a> )</p><p>The end result is that a user would see a webpage on the iPhone which would allow him/her/it to see status of the car and control aspects of the car.&nbsp; Same with hottubs, home environment, office building, etc.</p><p>I don&#039;t what kinds of Linux wireless extensions or configurations to look for to do this, if it can be done at all.&nbsp; How should I proceed?</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance and in arrears</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wirelessPuppet</strong> on 31 Jul 2007, 06:29)</p>
