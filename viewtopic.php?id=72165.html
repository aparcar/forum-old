					<p>Hello,<br />Would someone please help me with this issue,</p><p>1) I have the remote OpenVPN server at the remote site. (Centos, server)<br />and then</p><p>2) I have an OpenWRT router here (OpenWRT Attitude, client)</p><p>3) I have one computer connected to OpenWRT Attitude router.</p><p>OpenWRT can connect to the OpenVPN also is able to ping internet sites in Attitude busybox. that means internet works on OpenWRT.</p><p>However, the computer connected under OpenWRT can&#039;t access to the internet but it can connect to OpenWRT.</p><p>Additional Info, <br />I have Chaos Calmer OpenWRT router, if I switch to Chaos Calmer router, it works fine and the computer internet works fine.</p><p>I&#039;m very new to Attitude, is there additional setting has to be done in Attitude router?</p><p>Since the centos server is fine because it&#039;s been working flawlessly with Chaos Calmer routers.</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>seandex</strong> on 26 Sep 2017, 22:16)</p>
