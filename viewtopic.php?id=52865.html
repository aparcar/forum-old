					<p>Hi,</p><p>I was looking at buying a router. TP-Link ones seems a good choice for OpenWRT both looking at price, features and suppport.</p><p>There&#039;s some posts about Archer C7 but I can&#039;t find one about the C8. It&#039;s mainly the same stuff, but before buying, I&#039;d like to be sure it works with OpenWRT.</p><p>For the C7, there&#039;s those differences between v1 and v2, which seems far better supported. Is the same thing exists with C8?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Stéphane</p>									</div>

					<p>After searching, I see that C8 seems based on Broadcom BCM4709 and from here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.broadcom.bcm47xx,">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/so … m.bcm47xx,</a> that it seems that 5GHz wifi doesn&#039;t work with the b43 open source driver integrated in OpenWRT, but perhaps with the brcm80211.</p><p>I&#039;m really not sure of what I&#039;m saying.

					<p>So, it seems wiser to get back on an Archer C7. The problem is this v2 version that we are always unsure this is the one we buy. I think I will perhaps get a WDR3600. Thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

It comes with the latest / supported 5GHZ AC hardware found in V2 of AC7.

					<p>If you buy locally, TP-Link clearly labels the version of the hardware on the box, so it&#039;s not really a lottery. Different issue if buying online. In the US, I believe Newegg and Amazon both specify what version they&#039;re offering.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sadly, I cannot buy locally as I live in France and not in Paris, so no way to get a good IT shop. I cannot get an answer on Amazon on the version of the firmware. I don&#039;t look on Newegg and don&#039;t know if they ship to France. I will get a look.</p><p>I will also get a look on C5.</p><p>The final word: I&#039;m always tempted by newest models as they are logically better, for Wifi speed for instance, and design also in case of the C8. But, perhaps it&#039;s time to look at my real needs (home network) and perhaps buy a more modest model like WDR ones.</p><p>Thanks to all of you for your advice.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are looking at using openWRT on the C7, make sure you get the V2 version. OpenWRT does not work on the V1 of the Archer C7.</p><p>There is a good and simple comparison between the C7 and C8 at <a href="http://jamescausian.hubpages.com/hub/TP-Link-Archer-C7-vs-C8">http://jamescausian.hubpages.com/hub/TP … r-C7-vs-C8</a>.

					<p>To be more precise, OpenWRT does work on the C7 V1 but the 5GHz WiFi is not supported, the rest works fine.</p><p>The C5 used to be the safe choice because v1.20 was the only one on sale. However according to the wiki there is a v2.0 that is Broadcom based. I recently got a C5 and got the v1.20 so I don&#039;t know how widespread the newer revision is.</p><p>see also <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a></p><p>Of course if you have more modest needs you can get one of the non-ac models you mentioned. I&#039;d also check prices on other models like WDR4300 and then pick what best fits your needs.</p>									</div>

					<p>I finally go for the WDR3600 without USB3 but I&#039;m so tired of my ISP box (Orange Livebox). It seems a good choice both in term of price and for OpenWRT support. Thanks to all for your pieces of advice.</p>									</div>
