					<p>My router is wndr3700v2.</p><p>I was very happy user with basic networking knowledge of attitude adjustment. Since it was working fine for my needs, never bothered to update.</p><p>Now that I have new ISP, it looks like I need to tinker with my settings and I am looking for suggestions to configure my network. I did upgrade to Chaos Calmer. Whole upgrade process was very smooth.</p><p>Earlier ISP, it was a simple drop with one port on the modem which was connected to router. With new ISP (ATT UVerse), the modem has WIFI and DHCP server. To add to the complications, ATT modem needs to be connected to its settop box via eathernet cable. I have cables running in the house, so this is not a big problem. Configuring both of these to work together and seamlessly is the challenge.</p><p>All external drops are coming to a closet in the house. Since we had only one router things did not matter much</p><p>Now, if possible, I would like to move wndr3700v2 router to different room. It supports two wifi networks, use one of the wifi as repeater for ATT network, use other one for guests and use ethernet ports as a switch so that I can connect one port to settop box and use other ports as required.</p><p>I also wondering if future ISP changes will have impact on my network if I go this way as ATT router seems to be main network controller in this scenario.</p><p>Can this be achieved? What settings do I change? </p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
