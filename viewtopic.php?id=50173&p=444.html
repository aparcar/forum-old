					<p>Thanks for pingplotter, I&#039;ve heard it referred to but not used it. You&#039;re right on about not knowing where in the path latencies are introduced when you just get a one number result. I&#039;m just curious about this stuff since I&#039;m not a gamer, and don&#039;t perceive the results of bufferbloat here anyways. Other than what dslreports tells me...there is one hop in the path between me and dslreports according to pingplotter that has excess latency (part of Comcast&#039;s infrastructure), but from what I&#039;m seeing most of the latency must be from my router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RogerSC</strong> on 8 May 2016, 10:05)</p>
