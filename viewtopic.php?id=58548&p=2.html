					<p>EW-7811 simple solution found!<br />I had exactly the same issue as described above - with very low data rates.&nbsp; Basic hardware and OpenWRT software setup is the same - however I changed three things as I suspected that the two radios were interfering with each other.</p><p>1. physically separated the two radios by plugging the EW7811 into the end of a 50cm usb extension cable <br />2. ensuring the wifi channels are well apart - Ch1 and Ch13 in my case<br />3. reducing the TM02 transmit power to 10dBm from 20dBm<br />The biggest change was when adding the usb extension cable.</p><p>My setup = iMac Ch13 (192,168.2..x) --&gt; TM02 10dBm --&gt; EW7811UN Ch1 / 20dBm (192.168.1.x) --&gt; Netgear WNDR3700 --&gt; Virginmedia Broadband</p><p>Data rates using <a href="http://www.speedtest.net">www.speedtest.net</a>:<br />1.&nbsp; iMac direct to Netgear broadband router = 81.4 / 11.1 Mbps<br /> 2. EW7811 plugged directly into TM02 (Ch1 / Ch6 20dBm) = 2.8 / 0.99 Mbps<br /> 3. EW7811 plugged into 50cm USB2 extension cable (Ch1 / Ch13 10dBn) = 17.3 / 3.9 Mbps</p><p>This is now a very workable travel router.</p>									</div>

After I posted, I decided to take the plunge and loaded wingspinners files. Then did exactly what you said, and updated to the RC 2 version. [openwrt-15.05-rc2-ramips-rt305x-ht-tm02-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin]</p><p>That seemed to all go without a hitch. </p><p>However, right now I can&#039;t seem to get into the LUCI interface. It seems like I can still connect via putty, but can&#039;t seem to actually login (root w. blank password did not work). My computer, connected to the hootoo does get a DHCP ip address, so I can assume I haven&#039;t totally borked it yet. </p><p>As for the streaming and speed away from home, I understand that speeds will be lower, etc. It&#039;s a BONUS if i can stream hd quality stuff from say Emby or whatnot. BUT, not mandatory. If I can get my kid&#039;s shows (lower quality stuff) streamed, I&#039;d be happy. I actually had an edi-max laying around from a few years ago, so there was no additional cost. If it works, GREAT! if not, meh nothing lost other than time. </p><p>I recently went on a cruise and the hootoo was useful, but now i need MORE - of course. </p><p>I also saw someone having instructions on doing similar with tp-link unit. newegg has them for $12 on refurb - i&#039;m tempted to bite on that as well.</p><p>EDIT:</p><p>I found that I need to use TELNET and not SSH and got right in. I&#039;m thinking i DO need to install luci, as it&#039;s not installed by default?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AxeBro</strong> on 26 Oct 2015, 17:56)</p>

I thought openvpn will stop trying after a while. So i disabled the init script and just fire it up after i&#039;ve confirmed a wifi association.

					<p>The reboot issue is benign, and nothing gets corrupt (that I know of).&nbsp; You can use reboot -f to get it to reboot.&nbsp; I have a fix, but not posted it yet.&nbsp; Soon..</p><p>One approach directly does a copy and replace to the file.&nbsp; The other is an edit to the file itself.&nbsp; </p><p>Re VPN, no harm to your approach, but I do not think it is needed.&nbsp; Test.&nbsp; BTW, I think you might want to check out luci-app-commands.&nbsp; You can create buttons for shell commands.&nbsp; I find that the initscripts and Services=&gt; OpenVPN controls are not entirely reliable.</p>									</div>

					<p>welp - my setup DOES NOT work, i hard coded google DNS all over the place - and now all captive portals fail. I tried to revert to and undo the damage, but something is still amiss. i might have to scrap and start all over. looking into your solution now.</p>									</div>
