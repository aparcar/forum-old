					<p>I need a wifi linux box for a long standing project. I need a supported hardware with a serial port. The hardware has to be &quot;stable&quot;, no new version every buy I made. I think to the 4G System AccesCube but I don&#039;t find any store who sell it. It seems to be renamed Meshbox or something similar, but nothing found. I try to ask to 4G System and they don&#039;t have it anymore in their product catalogue.</p><p>Where can I buy such product (in Europe)?</p><p>Leandro</p>									</div>
