					<p>I, like many people would like to use OpenDNS on my Kamikaze install of 8.09. However, there seem to be several problems that prevent this from being done via the GUI.</p><p>As suggested by JoW, the following should be done to use different DNS servers:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>JoW wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>If you prefer the webif, goto Network -&gt; Interface -&gt; WAN, add the additional option &quot;DNS-Server&quot;. Fill in the DNS server ips separated by space in there and hit Save &amp; Apply.</p></blockquote></div><p>If this method is used, with the two servers separated by a space, then the system returns an error of invalid IP address and does not apply the changes or restart the WAN interface. If you put one OpenDNS IP address you can apply the change, but it does nothing as on PPoE authentication the servers provided by the ISP are accepted instead and used according to the logs.</p><p>Also, when you add the option &quot;DNS-Server&quot; as directed in the quote above, it also adds an option with a check box to use peer DNS. In all instances that this box is unchecked, the router does not perform successful look-ups, no matter what DNS servers you fill into the DNS-Server address box above it.</p><p>It would appear that this is a problem with final builds that has been fixed in trunk but that final builds for download are affected by per this post: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=83883#p83883">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=83883#p83883</a></p><p>So the question is, has anyone successfully gotten OpenDNS working on 8.09 final without resorting to CLI changes, IE using the webif. And if not, can anyone advise on how to apply Jow&#039;s backport located here: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/14562">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/14562</a> to my current system as a patch?</p>									</div>

					<p>The only webif-only solution I can think of right now, is to add some advanced dns options and advertise the dns servers to dhcp clients. This way OpenWrt itself will still use ISP-DNS servers but clients bypass that and talk directly to OpenDNS. However you would loose caching then.</p><p>Try this workaround:<br />- Go to Network -&gt; Services -&gt; Dnsmasq<br />- Add field &quot;DHCP-Options&quot;<br />- Fill in &quot;6,a.b.c.d,w.x.y.z&quot;<br />- Hit Save &amp; Apply<br />- Refresh DHCP leases on client pc</p><p>The client should now use a.b.c.d and w.x.y.z as DNS servers.</p><p>~ JoW</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jow</strong> on 6 May 2009, 19:26)</p>

					<p>Unfortunately not.<br />That LuCI does not accept a list of ips is a bug on the webif side, it performs validation on the given value and tries to parse the given list as a single ip address which obviously fails. If you add &quot;option dns &#039;...&#039;&quot; to /etc/config/network, it will be processed by OpenWrt but still has no effect since the ip addresses given there will be added _after_ the isp dns servers and therefore never be used.</p><p>In the meanwhile a fixed dhcp script has been applied to both trunk and the 8.09 branch. I&#039;m afraid you have to wait for the upcoming 8.09 bugfix release for a proper solution.<br />If you eager to fix it now, you could try the new script (which solves disconnect on dhcp renew too btw.) by using the following commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /usr/share/udhcpc/
wget -Odefault.script http://quamquam.org/~jow/default.script
reboot</code></pre></div><p>To restore the original version:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rm /jffs/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script
reboot</code></pre></div><p>The webif validation can be silenced by removing the file /lib/uci/schema/default/network . This won&#039;t have any serious side effects execept that the webif lets you enter any value without further checking.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>I installed 8.09.1 over the weekend for the very purpose of taking advantage of the recent patches that restored functionality to OpenDNS use via LUCI or CLI.</p><p>Alas, neither seems to work using the latest builds still. If I enter the DNS servers separated by a space, I still get an invalid IP address response, which would seems to indicate that LuCi is still not correctly identifying the two sets of numbers as valid IP addresses.</p><p>Has anyone had any luck using OpenDNS on the newly released 8.09.1 builds?

					<p>Another bump. </p><p>It does not seem to work properly here either.</p><p>When setting the option dns &quot;w.x.y.z&quot; and disabling &quot;use peer DNS&quot;, then dnsmasq stops working as a DNS proxy and the clients will get &quot;w.x.y.z&quot; as DNS instead of the routers IP.<br />Hence the local (static) hosts will not be resolved properly.</p><p>As a workaround I just don&#039;t use the &quot;option dns&quot; and enable &quot;use peer DNS&quot; and finally add an&nbsp; &quot;echo w.x.y.z &gt; /tmp/resolv.conf.auto&quot; to the /etc/ppp/ip-up script.</p><p>Is there a better solution (i.e. forcing dnsmasq to use a specified DNS and ignore the one supplied by PPP)?</p><p>In the end I think there should be a way to properly override the DNS server supplied by PPP without interfering the rest of the infrastructure.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
