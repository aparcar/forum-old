					<p>I run into this weird situation recently. I have 3 bridged aps which get there ips from a router(dhcp). If I set three SSIDs to the same, and connect my samsung s4(i9500) to it. I can not open any webs or renew my NEWS-apps. But I can still send messages out from ICQ or other APPS. Looks like a DNS probelm.&nbsp; I tried&nbsp; : &quot; tcpdump -nn -i br-lan host ip-of-my-phone and udp port 53 &quot;,&nbsp; get nothing when opening webs or renewing NEWS-apps, and get right dns requests when sending messages out from ICQ. What is even&nbsp; more strange is that only my phone has this problem, not samsung s7, iphone6, HUAWEI honor6(They open webs normally and tcpdump shows right requests). I am not sure if anyother cell-phone has this problem.<br />This also happens when I set two SSIDs to the same (Normal at this moment) and adding one more SSID(Abnormal Now).</p><br /><p>My SDK version is : trunk-r49086<br />SOC is : Qualcomm Atheros 9531<br />Borad type is: AP147</p><p>Any help and suggestion will be appreciated.<br />Thanks a lot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blademaster98</strong> on 16 Jun 2016, 08:45)</p>
