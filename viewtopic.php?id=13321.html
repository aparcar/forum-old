					<p>Hello!</p><p>I tried to integrate an (external) printserver into my lan. Router is an ASUS WL-500g Premium with Kamikaze 7.09 (2.4). I encountered several problems (I have not used WLAN/WPA with the router last weeks) so I switched back to basic testing.</p><p>Even with tests with a wlan-connection from my WinXP (best signal, 3m from router) I must encounter steadily timeouts while pinging another server, surfing to websites. Without WPA connections work fine.</p><p>Are there any known issues with WPA and this Kamikaze-version?<br />Where can I go ahead with testing (/var/log/messages is without errors)?</p><p>Kind regards, thx, Jens</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmeyerdo</strong> on 8 Nov 2007, 22:46)</p>
