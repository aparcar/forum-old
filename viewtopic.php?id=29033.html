					<p>Hello all,</p><p>First of all, this is a fresh start for me here and with openwrt.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to use a F5L049 (Belkin homebase), which is actually listed in the &quot;possible but not beeing work on&quot; hardware list. It has an AR9130 mips processor. I&#039;ve been working with the belkin&#039;s GPL which is fair enought, but limited to some functionnalities which i&#039;d like to extend.</p><p>My idea was to use openwrt...</p><p>So my question is : how do i start ?</p><p>Or more :<br />I&#039;m able to create an image and flash it to the device, which has a strange bootloader. How do i continue with openwrt ?</p><p>Did somebody got a try with this product ?</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>

You might need to add a utility for creating the correct images to tools/firmware-utils</p><p>KM</p>									</div>

					<p>On step is to gain access to the system or to the bootloader: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/hw.hacking.first.steps">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/hw.ha â€¦ irst.steps</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;does this help with that? Is it straight forward enough?<br />Then you flash the firmware: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing</a></p><p>Before that, you need to obtain a firmware:&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;the last one, compile everything.</p><p>And the Kingpin: Hack the Source-Code (I think the OpenWrt source-code not the other one) to make it support your device: NOTHING. You can try to milk these articles <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#developing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start#developing</a> for information.

					<p>Since I&#039;m a stranger to OpenWrt, I couldn&#039;t do it. I used the default firmware which is opensource. Thus, I can probably help you in someway.</p><p>Also, I think the product won&#039;t be produced anymore, since it&#039;s seems to be disappearing from more and more online shops.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.</p><p>It would have been nice to run openwrt on it as it is one of the best devices out there, 4 usb2, lots of memory and RAM and a fast processor.<br />Openwrt is like a distro on it&#039;s own nice to play around with and it has many options.</p><p>I understand how to run it but when it comes to installing it never had much experience with it either, as routers are a little bit different from normal PC.</p>									</div>

					<p>I agree. I&#039;m very convinced about OpenWRT, but for it&#039;s hard to adapt the distribution for an unknown device. And, I can agree it&#039;s very fast, i&#039;m able to run java/osgi on it, which is not that common.</p>									</div>
