					<p>I&#039;ve voted other, too. <br />I&#039;m running OpenWrt at home on a Linksys WRT54GS and if everything goes well, this night it will run on a Belkin, too. At the office I run it on an Asus WL-500G, and at production (outdoor WDS links) I run it on 3 WRT54v2 routers and on 2 Asus WL-500b routers.<br />Installation problems occour only on the Asus ones, because the reset switch works somewhat weird (if you remember, it seems to use the same GPIO, etc, but if resetmon is enabled, it simply boots into failsafe everytime. Oh, and in failsafe, it switches WAN &amp; LAN, so it will listen on the WAN port as 192.168.1.1 <br /><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /><br />I will drop a line about the Belkin, when it&#039;s flashed.</p>									</div>
