					<p>By the way, you need create one main router (DHCP, which have route to second router). Or you can configure only one where will be two Vlans for two WAN connection and one for LAN.</p><p>Another way you need always select default route (from which router go to network) on PC manually.</p>									</div>

					<p>What are you trying to achieve, Equal Cost MultiPath (ECMP) routing or outgoing failover? You can not configure incoming failover unless you are routing BGP with both of your ISPs.</p><p>If you want ECMP, you&#039;ll need to install Quagga to both routers, put your default gateway IP on a virtual VLAN IP and then configure ECMP links to the real outgoing gateway IP addresses. It&#039;s a bit of a complicated setup.</p><p>If you simply want outgoing failover, then you still need to use Quagga for route monitoring:</p><p><a href="http://doauto.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/setting-a-backup-default-route-for-quagga-in-linux/">http://doauto.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/ â€¦ -in-linux/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>the thing is so, my cable connection it has a great speed (at least here in argentina) 20mb, but because i&#039;m far off the servers (at least that told me customer service of my isp) the service is a piece of sh... so i get a dsl connection of 3mb, but its in another par of the house, where i have the 2nd router.<br />so, if its possible i want to merge the internet connections, if not, i want to use the dsl connection when the cable connection is down.</p><br /><p>thanks for your time.</p>									</div>

					<p>ECMP will be your best bet then. It will utilize both connections at the same time, unless one of them is down.</p>									</div>
