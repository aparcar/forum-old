					<p>I want to configure openwrt to able to make DNS resolv of the PCs in my home network. Some of them have static ip and some dynamic. From what I have already configure through the guides in the wiki for the dnsmasq, the PCs with dynamic are able to resolve each other but the others with static can resolve only if I put the entries to the hosts file.</p><p>Is it possible to make the PCs with the static IPs to register themselves to DNS (either to dnsmasq or to some other dns software)</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I need to setup a DNS manually but I don&#039;t know exactly if there is a package to do it exactly what I want. dnsmasq seems to be more a forwarder than a local DNS server in a case that it doesn&#039;t provide also the IP from a DHCP pool. I had used a guide with Maradns but I didn&#039;t see any results.</p><p>As far for the need of static, I disagree, partially. In large environments of course the solution of DHCP is mandatory and the only way. But in a home with a NAS and 2-3 PCs the static IPs is a better, more bulletproof solution. Of course we exclude the usage of mobiles and friends laptops. No static for them. That&#039;s why I have a mixed environment.</p>									</div>
