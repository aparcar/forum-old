					<p>Hallo,</p><p>is it possible to access Samba shares via Strongswan VPN tunnel when both are running on the same OpenWRT router?

					<p>Yes it&#039;s a VPN, you can use any layer 3 service you like. OpenWrt is locked down by default so you will need to add firewall rules to allow whatever traffic you want. You can do this either by using leftfirewall=yes or by integrating the needed rules yourself. I like to do it myself, and to make it easier I create a zone for my VPN subnets like this: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt ~# uci show firewall.@zone[1]
firewall.cfg16dc81=zone
firewall.cfg16dc81.name=&#039;vpn&#039;
firewall.cfg16dc81.input=&#039;ACCEPT&#039;
firewall.cfg16dc81.output=&#039;ACCEPT&#039;
firewall.cfg16dc81.forward=&#039;ACCEPT&#039;
firewall.cfg16dc81.subnet=&#039;192.168.100.0/24 192.168.101.0/24 192.168.102.0/24&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Having the default input policy as ACCEPT will make connections to the router work, including DNS. For accessing LAN you will need forwarding rules between VPN/LAN zone.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 26 Nov 2015, 22:27)</p>

					<p>I have already enabled leftfirewall=yes (that&#039;s the reason probably why it works to LAN but without access to OpenWRT itself), if I want to define it manually (as in your example), do I need to disable it (delete it from ipsec.conf)?</p>									</div>

If it looks the same to you, then you can assume that the traffic reaches samba. Look at your config, turn on some debugging, do some tcpdumping and good luck <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 29 Nov 2015, 00:41)</p>

					<p>There is something strange.. which I don&#039;t understand.</p><p>1. If I have vpn zone, forwarding enabled and leftfirewall=no (so rules should be handled by firewall, not strongswan itself), I can access LAN&nbsp; hosts, ping OpenWRT local IP, but no access to internet nor Samba. I have all correct definitions in firewall, chain zone like yours (exactly), dnsmasq is set up to acccept all requests (not just local LAN)..</p><p>2. If I have no vpn zone, leftfirewall=yes, I can access LAN hosts (even without any forwarding rules, they are apparently created on-the-fly by strongswan), ping OpenWRT local IP, access to internet (when I have DNS other than OpenWRT local IP), but no access to OpenWRT services (LuCi, Samba, DNS) - the only responding service is ping (ICMP).</p><p>Is there something in kernel what I should check? It looks like OpenWRT is blocking everything coming 10.1.1.x/24 from wan except ping (as ipsec/strongswan doesn&#039;t create separate network interface like OpenVPN), but routing/forwarding correctly to LAN.</p><p>I talked with one strongswan guy and he confirmed, that strongswan is configured and working correctly - it must be something on OpenWRT side..</p><p>Are you running on BB, CC or some DD trunk?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been using strongSwan/OpenVPN with a VPN zone since BB, and I&#039;m currently on DD. OpenWrt version does not matter at all, this is Linux netfilter and it has worked the same ways for ages. What you need to do is this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># iptables -v -n -L INPUT</code></pre></div><p>Then traverse into the next chain like &quot;-L delegate_input&quot; and so on. Without knowing your rule set, you are basically blind as to what&#039;s going on. This goes for any kind of firewall.</p><p>Firewall rules are top down and stops at first ACCEPT/DROP/REJECT, so start at the top and work your way down. It&#039;s not a huge table by any means, so you should be able to get a better understanding how it works. Keep your source, destination, port and input interface in mind when you look at the rules to see if there is a match in your ruleset. strongSwan packets will come in through your WAN interface.</p><p>The INPUT chain decides packets arriving at the router, so this is where you will need to check for DNS and Samba being accepted.</p><p>If you are having trouble accessing LAN or internet, use &quot;-L FORWARD&quot;, as that chain decides what to do about packets going through the router to any other destination.</p><p>When you assign subnet to a zone, there should be appropriate references in the INPUT and FORWARD chains for traffic originating from that subnet.</p><p>When you use -v you will also see hit counters, so you can keep track of how many packets hit a specific rule. That way you can deduce where your traffic ends up without turning on any logging.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 29 Nov 2015, 14:46)</p>

					<p>That will work, the &quot;problem&quot; with that setup is that it doesn&#039;t allow fine grained control of your traffic as it overrides the OpenWrt ruleset. The rules strongSwan makes will accept anything, even if you have a zone that you don&#039;t want VPN clients to reach. Although accepting anything from VPN clients might be exactly what most people want <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
