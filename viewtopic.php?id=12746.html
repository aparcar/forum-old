					<p>holding down the reset button on power on till the leds flash should bring it into failsafe mode, depending on the router of course.</p><p>Before trying that look up your router on the wiki to find out how to bring it into failsafe mode under Kamikaze, also some details might help people on these forums, I&#039;m no expert sorry.</p><br /><p>-Rip</p>									</div>
