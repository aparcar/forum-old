					<p>Hello,</p><br /><p>after recognizing that my Asus WL-500gP made a max. throughput of 5.5 MB/s on NAT I googled that issue and found a thread [1] stating it could be an OpenWRT issue as the original FW would manages to route full 10 MB/s over NAT. Today I was able to verify that behaviour: indeed, the Asus does the full 10 MB/s over NAT when using the original FW.</p><p>Is this a known issue of the OpenWRT-project or is there a problem on my configuration? Can anyone provide similar experiences?</p><br /><p>Best regards</p><p>dingo</p><br /><p>[1] <a href="http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=14951">http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=14951</a></p>									</div>
