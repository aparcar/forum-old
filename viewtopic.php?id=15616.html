					<p>In the interest of progressing 7.10 and helping the developers I was thinking of searching through all the tickets to see what could be cleaned up.&nbsp; I started looking and soon realized that I don&#039;t have a clue on some of them since either a) I don&#039;t have the hardware or b) haven&#039;t seen that particular problem before.</p><p>Here&#039;s one such example that I can relate to since I have a few DG834Gv2&#039;s and have never seen <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2332">this problem</a>.&nbsp; nabcore, we&#039;ve been through a few new kernels since the last post.&nbsp; Is it still a problem?&nbsp; You&#039;ve done some fantastic testing for the project nabcore, I don&#039;t mean to single you out, but you get the idea.</p><p>So instead of going through all the tickets myself, why not help out the devs and everyone take part in researching them a little more.&nbsp; I for one think OpenWrt is by far the best embedded distro out there.&nbsp; It&#039;s &quot;use only the packages you need&quot; and &quot;CLI only&quot; approach has helped me learn more and more about the inner workings of Linux.</p><p>ar7-2.6 is nearly stable and it&#039;s about time it&#039;s included in a non-svn release of Kamikaze.<br />I think there needs to be some focus put on this ticket and we can all help out: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2024">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2024</a></p><p>Still not sure why 7.09 still has active tickets....shouldn&#039;t they all be moved over to 7.10?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi KillaB,</p><p>With respect to <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2332">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2332</a> , I&#039;ve not seen it in a while, hence it can be closed. As an aside, I don&#039;t like closing bugs because they&#039;ve not been seen in a while. I subscribe to the concept of causality; every problem has a cause and when a bug is closed because of its age, it&#039;s never known if its cause was actually solved. Conversely, I am aware that this is a real world situation and sometimes &quot;things just need to be done&quot;.</p><p>Secondly... I have a quite a few bugs in the database and I think the major issue I&#039;ve found with the AR7 section of the OpenWrt project is that of apathy. In some bugs, I&#039;ve actually offered a solution with in the ticket:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3222">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3222</a></p><p>As for others, they are just epic issues that never seem quite solved and never see an end in sight:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3124">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3124</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3047">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3047</a></p><p>And then other bugs just never get picked up:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3120">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/3120</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2999">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2999</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2988">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2988</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2555">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2555</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2378">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2378</a></p><p>Some of these could be closed with, &quot;not seeing any more, hence close it&quot;, but I rarely run the latest trunk any more since I sick of breakage. I&#039;m trying to make some progress with acx-mac80211, both in being a test bed and providing patches back to the main acx-mac80211 devs. I cannot do this if my development platform works one day and then does not the following day: the move from 2.6.23 to .24 caused two months of issues with the ethernet support. If I&#039;m messing around with a regression issue, it takes time away from helping some new along and I think getting the wireless to work on this device is a good target.</p><p>Returning to the point at hand, it may be worth triaging bugs on whether they actually hold up the next release.</p>									</div>
