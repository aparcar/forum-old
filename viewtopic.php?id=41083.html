					<p>Hello to all,<br />3 months have passed since the package &quot;luci-app-openvpn&quot; has been marked as broken (<a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/ticket/489">http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/ticket/489</a>). I am well aware of the difficulties and commitment that requires the development of applications, so it is not in my intention to ask that someone have to repair that package, but I&#039;d just like to know if someone is working to repair luci-app-openvpn.<br />Thank you for any replies.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>grzmrc</strong> on 14 Dec 2012, 00:32)</p>
