					<p>I have a problem when I try to access the router TP -Link TL - WR841ND v8 . What happens is this , I do the configuration of the router to work as a repeater . Everything went as planned , but I wanted to wear this router &#039;s DHCP server access point . So I configured the LAN interface of the repeater to DHCP Client , to point to the address of the Access Point . And on the side of the access point assigns the address of the repeater to stay in a fixed IP . By applying these new definitions , I&#039;m not getting more access to the repeater . I tried to access the repeater via SSH , Telnet , WEB GUI , but I have no success. Realizing the &quot; ping &quot; or performing a scan on the local network , he acknowledges , but connect to the administrative console , I can not . Below is some information about my problem :</p><p>* The Repeater is : TP -Link TL - WR841ND v8<br />* The fixed IP assigned to the repeater on the Access Point is 192.168.0.50<br />* The IP address of the Access Point is 192.168.0.1<br />* I tried to access Telnet , SSH , Web GUI with RJ 45 cable or wifi , but I can not .<br />* The only change to the Access Point was assigning fixed address repeater .<br />* The configuration I took to make the router into a repeater worked. But I changed the LAN interface for DHCP Client .</p><p>I know I fucked up , but I&#039;m trying to fix this my mistake .</p><p>Sorry for my english .</p>									</div>

					<p>Dhcp should work, but if your router somehow fails to connect, you won&#039;t ever reach it, because it does not get ip. Strange is that it responds to ping, but you should use static ips for devices reachable only via network. What I&#039;d recommend: now get your v8 router in failsafe, firstboot, set by &quot;dumb ap&quot; recipe and set wifi again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, okay complicated the situation: S. <br />According to this tutorial <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a> failsafe, I come to the second step. After her, I can not log into anything (Telnet, SSH or Web GUI) to continue the procedure. The application that this tutorial asks to download and run, nothing appears on the screen (recvudp.exe). </p><p>At the moment the router is connected with two lights, where the first is the power and is turned on, and the other is the SYS and blinks rapidly </p><p>I put the ip of your computer to 192.168.0.70 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 to try to connect, but still can not &#039;-&#039;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Finally I managed to access and reset the router settings. What my problem is that I connected the cable to the LAN port, rather than WAN. </p><p>Thanks to everyone who helped me ^ ^</p>									</div>
