					<p>Hello I have a (I think) quite simple task, which I cannot seem to figure out.</p><p>I want dropbear access on 192.168.1.1 and on 10.8.0.6 (my router is a vpn-client of my nas) but not on my wan. I tried opening up dropbear on only those ip&#039;s but it seems that is not possible unless I run 2 dropbear instances. So I tried to configure openwrt&#039;s firewall so that it blocks wan access on port 22, but thusfar unsuccessful.</p><p>This is my first rule in /etc/config/firewall, which I think would be sufficient, but it isn&#039;t:</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;Reject-WAN-SSH&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;22&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;*&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply, I changed the rule and zone, but got the same result. If I nmap my wan ip, it still shows port 22 (and port 53) open. </p><p>I nmapped my wan ip from within my own lan and thought maybe that had something to do with it. So I tried nmapping my wan ip while being connected to my neighbours&#039; wifi to test if ports 22 &amp; 53 are really open from the outside, and they are not.</p><p>There&#039;s probably a good reason for this behaviour, do you by any chance know why ? Does the router &#039;know&#039; that the nmap to the wan ip is actually coming from an ip inside the lan and therefore treat it as going to the lan-ip of the router instead ?</p><p>Anyhow since all the ports on the wan-side are closed when coming from the wan-side, the end result is okay with me...</p>									</div>

					<p>you cant see wan side from lan side.. you in fact nmaped lan side which is wide open.. see firewall &gt; lan zone<br />for you to nmap wan side connect pc to wan port set static ip on pc and router wan but in same subnet (ex: pc: 192.168.1.10 and router wan: 192.168.1.20) then you can check wan side</p><p>or use a router in fron of both your pc and test router wan side so you can take dhcp ip for both</p>									</div>
