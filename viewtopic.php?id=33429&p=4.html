					<p>Hi guys, <br />I am a big fan of your work and the MR3020. Currently I am trying to use it as a cheap&amp;tiny squeezebox client with squeezeslave and a usb-audio-card. <br />Till now I managed to get the audio card installed (madplay can play mp3 files), but I am struggeling with the installation of squeezeslave. There is are two builds of this tool: &quot;OpenWrt ar71xx OSS Package - Built for Backfire&quot; and &quot;OpenWrt ar71xx ALSA Package - Built for Backfire&quot;. In both cases I get an error &quot;bus error&quot; when trying to run squeezeslave. <br />Can somebody give me a hint why it is not working?<br />Cheers, <br />bonagel</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, i&#039;m new here and i want to tell everybody just keep up the good work !<br />I&#039;m in for buying a mini router (for a wifi repeater) like mr3020 or wr703n and i wanna ask what is the diffrence between them ? only the slide for mode switch ? i was looking in the compatibility list under tp-link for mr3020 but i cannot find it, tplink wr703n seems to be in the list. Which one is better? in my market mr3020 it&#039;s easier to find.<br />Thank you in advance !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>n3o</strong> on 17 Mar 2012, 12:17)</p>

					<p>Hi, <br />I know this is far away from what it should be done but as a temporary workaround for the buttons I think it would be possible to use something like this in a file next to 00-button in /etc/hotplug.d/button</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if [ $BUTTON == &quot;BTN_0&quot; ]; then
if [ $ACTION == &quot;pressed&quot; ]; then

(
for i in `seq 1 2500`; do true; done
if [ -f /tmp/var2 ]; then

logger Left
####
else
#### INSERT YOUR CODE FOR RIGHT POSITION HERE
logger Right

fi

#### CODE END
if [ -f /tmp/var2 ]; then
rm /tmp/var2
fi
fi
else
if [ $ACTION == &quot;released&quot; ]; then
touch /tmp/var2
fi
fi</code></pre></div><p>I dont think this would behave well under heavy load, but maybe for changing between mpd and some other app (although not switching back and forth very fast) it works. It relies on delaying by counting so basically it is highly unreliable, but I dont know other way of producing a delay.<br />As I said earlier, it could be something to use until someone find a way of handling the slide switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>@sophitus, look at this:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=155151">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=155151</a><br />I dont understand why it says you have to reflash using webGUI of stock firmware after using mtd -r write. It doesnt make any sense, does it? <br />Also, /tmp is RAM so check you have enough available free memory with the free command before uploading the image.</p>									</div>

					<p>maybe you just have to do a factory default reset once you flashed the stock firmware with mtd -r..</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there, I just found the MR3020 cheap on the net on my search for a piece of hardware that I can use to get a VPN-server at home for use with netbook and mobile phone.</p><p>Can somebody tell me if it can work as a VPN-server with DD-WRT and if it will work behind another router? Sadly my Linksys WRT54G (v5) and AVM Fritzbox 7170 <br />lack the support... and running the PC 24/7... nah. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Would be nice to hear a word about VPN. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Everbody,</p><p>I&#039;m an openwrt newbie, and I have a few generic questions. Thank you in advance if you can answer any of them.</p><p>Fist of all, I installed openwrt without problem. Logged over telnet and changed password. Left the device for a few days and forgot the password. I was able to recover by entering failsafe mode by powering the MR3020 with the WPS button pressed until it began blinking fast. This was VERY convenient. Thankyou whoever thought of this!!.</p><p>I then tried to install some packages to install a 3G modem with opkg following the wiki. Most of them installed OK, but 2 gave errors, as the version of the kernel I have installed and the version downloaded by opkg where not compatible. I gess I have to upgrade the kernel somehow.</p><p>What I&#039;ve done is build the complete Buildroot and images for the MR3020 following the wiki and selecting the MR3020 as the build target and some packages that I wanted either as modules or &quot;inline&quot;. I seem to have an image which presumably I can flash. Before I do this, i&#039;d like to know:</p><p>- When I select the MR3020 target in the menuconfig, are model specific things, such as hardware (say ethernet card driver, usb controller,...) or for example the custom failsafe mode script which responds to the WPS button automatically installed in the image?</p><p>- If not, iIs there somewhere where I can download the whole configuration, feeds, scripts,... used to build the binary distribution that is linked from the wiki page of the MR3020? I&#039;d like to use it as a base to customize it for my needs.</p><p>- Am I doing it the right way, or is it preferable to download a newer image and just customize and compile the packages with opkg?</p><p>Thank you,<br />Marcos</p>									</div>
