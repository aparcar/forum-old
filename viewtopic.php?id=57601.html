					<p>I&#039;m writing a bash script that depends on the ability to run the &quot;arp&quot; command and capture it into a variable or temp file but since this is a built in function of BusyBox it doesn&#039;t work. </p><p>Is there away around this? Can a full arp tool be installed?</p><p>All I really need to be able to do is check to see if a mac (the wifi of my iPhone) is on the network with a command like:</p><p>device1present=$(arp | grep -i -c xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)</p><p>But the arp command fails everytime I attempt to run it inside of a bash or ash script.</p>									</div>
