					<p>I&#039;m thinking about connecting a mmc or sd card to my se505 v1 router. <br />I looked for the gpio pins and that is what i found out:<br />gpio - function<br />0 - not soldered in led D26 left pin<br />2 - disabling causes reset<br />3 - wlan led<br />4 - www led<br />7 - disabling causes reset</p><p>As I read, I need 4 gpio pins and one of those should be input... had anybody found another gpio pin in this router?<br />Or maybe somebody connected a card to it?<br />The second not-soldered-in led is useless because it isn&#039;t nowhere connected.</p><p>I thought also about connecting a card to the pins, which are dedicated for a rs232 uart... As far I know it shoud be possible... but could somebody check it theoretically?</p>									</div>

					<p>In my opinion the best approach is to get the pin-out of the switch chip (you could update the Wiki page in the progress ;-) ), and to check for the SDI, SDO and the SCLK pins using the &quot;gpio&quot; tool. After that you know 3 of the 4 needed signals. Using the GPIO assigned to the www-LED for the select signal,&nbsp; you can make a matching MMC kernel module.</p><p>Alternatively you could sell your SE505V1 at ebay, get a SE505V2, upgrade the memory to 16, 32 or 64MB, and add a USB port. Even USB1.1 is much faster than the MMC mod :-)</p><p>I&#039;ve got a spare Belkin F5D7230-4 V1000 here, which might be basically the same hardware as the SE505V1. It would be nice, if you could post an IC list and a picture of the PCB. It would be even better, if you could update the Wiki page.</p><p>Cheers<br />/T</p>									</div>

					<p>I compared the pictures you published with the PCB of my Belkin F5D7230-4 V1000, and I think that it&#039;s basically the same board.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I also like to add a SD or MMC Card to my Belkin F5D7230 V1000 and V1010. They have exactly the same PCB like your SE505.<br />Did you find the GPIO Pins ? Or did you find a possibilty to connect a card to J1 2x10 Pin connector ?</p><p>I&#039;ve searched for hours to find somebody who has done the sd mod with this routers, but sadly I havn&#039;t found anything.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Elektron</p>									</div>
