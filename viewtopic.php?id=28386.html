					<p>not 100% certain but as far as I know the routing is done on basis of ip addresses and the FQDN gets translated at the beginning of the process.<br />But what you could do is write a script that is started as a crond job at regular time intervals and that retrieves , using nslookup, the current ip address of the FQDN, compares it to the one thusfar used that is stored in //tmp not to fatigue flash memory, and that when the two do not match updates the storage, removes the old one from the routing table, introduces the new one, and flushes cache to activate the new settings. <br />I do something similar to check whether a dynamic dns server is still giving out the proper address or needs updating. Here is an example shell script, untested, that could be a starting point. But very robust it will never be. Example: the target is a webserver that issues a redirect; only the first contact will follow the VPN, the rest not. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
