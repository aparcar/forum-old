					<p>Hi everybody.&nbsp; Wanted to report two issues with links on the web site; I&#039;m sorry if this is the wrong place to do it, but it seemed reasonable to do in the community documentation forum since it&#039;s about docs. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>1. I&#039;ve contributed to the wiki in the past, but I am a little confused as to the status of it.&nbsp; Does anybody know what&#039;s up?<br />&nbsp; a. There&#039;s no longer a login button when you get to it from the main page.&nbsp; Also, while the Wiki link on the <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a> links to &quot;wiki.openwrt.org&quot;, it redirects to &quot;oldwiki.openwrt.org&quot;, leading me to believe that there is a &quot;new&quot; wiki in the works.&nbsp; True?<br />&nbsp; b. Also, when you click on the &quot;Documentation&quot; link from the main page (<a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a>), you get linked to <a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html">http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html</a>.&nbsp; This has a link for the wiki, (2.6.2&nbsp; Where to listen and talk), but again, the wiki.openwrt.org link (specifically, wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs) redirects to oldwiki.openwrt.org (<a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs</a>), and that link is broken (404 not found)</p><p>2. On the main page (openwrt.org/) currently, the top item is &quot;What is OpenWrt?&quot;.&nbsp; There is a link, &quot;&gt; Supported Devices&quot; that leads to &quot;http://toh.openwrt.org/&quot;.&nbsp; However, this link seems to lead right back to the front page.</p><p>Does anybody know what&#039;s up?</p><p>Thanks mucho!</p><p>--JF</p>									</div>

					<p>I too am wondering what is going on. The information in the forums is great, but community sourced documentation in the form of a Wiki would be much better.</p><p>TOH being broken is a more substantial issue for me as I need to acquire additional hardware in the near future and have used TOH to figure out which devices are known to work.</p><p>Anyone have info?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am just catching up to this problem.</p><p>For a while I saw a new Wiki site with hardware grouped by model in seperate pages.&nbsp; Now I see wiki points to oldwiki.</p><p>If I update the oldwiki, will I be wasting my efforts?&nbsp; Will things switch back to the new one again?</p>									</div>
