					<p>I cannot exceed ~400 KB/s with an scp (blowfish) from LAN to /tmp which is not enough for my requirements and my 16Mbit adsl2+ connection which is going online tomorrow (using an WL500gd). If it is not too much effort, could someone build a faster package for me?<br />In dropbear&#039;s option.h there is an option called DROPBEAR_SMALL_CODE, which can be undefined to accelerate things. Maybe gcc&#039;s optimization flags would also help to some extend. I can live with a larger binary.</p><p>/* Set this if you want to use the DROPBEAR_SMALL_CODE option. This can save<br /> * several kB in binary size, however will make the symmetrical ciphers (AES,<br /> * DES etc) slower (perhaps by 50%). Recommended for most small systems. */<br />#define DROPBEAR_SMALL_CODE<br />&nbsp; <br />Thanks in advance<br />J.Ruhe</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jruhe</strong> on 23 May 2006, 00:50)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s relatively easy to build your own packages using the SDK. Anyways, why not use ftp or ttcp if you need high transfer-rates?</p>									</div>

					<p>If someone else could do it I would prefer this way, because I had to install Linux, the SDK and get used to the build process. My knowlege about Linux, gcc and make is also limited as I am a Java devoloper since years. Yes, I could run a normal FTP server but would prefer sftp or scp.</p><p>J.Ruhe</p>									</div>

					<p>You need a router with more powerful CPU if You want high transfer rates with encrypted traffic (or simply do the crypto stuff on your desktop and not on the router).</p>									</div>

					<p>The annoying point is, that the WL500gd has a on-chip 75Mbit/s cryto-accelerator&nbsp; but I am afraid we will never see a driver for it (ubsec e.g.).<br />I think with a little bit of optimization (see first posting) one can double encrypted throughput without hardware-acceleration. A 200 Mhz CPU should be able to&nbsp; achieve this. </p><p>j.Ruhe</p>									</div>
