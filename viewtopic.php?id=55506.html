					<p>I was asked if I could use openwrt to build a set of vm routers to simulate a network path with failing hops and other problems. The idea being building a tiny openwrt router with virtual dual nic then copying as many of them as needed to simulate a network of routers.</p><p>So, the idea would be something like. All of the routers would be vms on the 172.16.30.x network so that we could reach them.</p><p>Say I want to ping router-6 from a vm which has it&#039;s gateway set to 172. 16.30.10.</p><p>nic0 - 172.16.30.10 gateway<br />router-1<br />nic1 - 172.16.30.11 - routes to router-2</p><p>nic0 - 172.16.30.20<br />router-2<br />nic1 - 172.16.30.21 - routes to router-3</p><p>nic0 - 172.16.30.30<br />router-3<br />nic1 - 172.16.30.31 - routes to router-4</p><p>nic0 - 172.16.30.40<br />router-4<br />nic1 - 172.16.30.41 - routes to router-5</p><p>nic0 - 172.16.30.50<br />router-5<br />nic1 - 172.16.30.51 - routes to router-6</p><p>nic0 - 172.16.30.60<br />router-6 target</p><p>Something along these lines. I don&#039;t know... maybe it&#039;s too complicated and not worth it but thought I would ask.</p>									</div>
