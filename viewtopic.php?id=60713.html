					<p>If your router is doing NAT properly, I do not see how can they see any internal IP address on the cell tower; you should not need to add any specific filter.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your reply</p><p>So the story is I have the default firewall&nbsp; and Verizon keeps dropping me under heavy traffic, now I have a technician friend who has access to verizon network. </p><p>He told me when I get dropped he can see my laptop lan ip on the cell tower (clear violation) and during ip packet rewrite is when the tower is dropping me. he went on to tell me you should never see the private ip&#039;s outside of your router. and that some routers due leak private IP&#039;s.</p><p>So after some research I came across Bogons. I don&#039;t know how to filter my network to stop my lan ip from getting out.</p><p>As for NAT I have not made any changes to openwrt.</p><p>and it doesn&#039;t make sense that my IP from the CELL provider has my laptop internal ip within the packet.</p>									</div>

					<p>Perhaps there is something wrong with your configuration after all... could you post your configuration files (/etc/config/network and /etc/config/firewall) here to be sure, please?</p>									</div>
