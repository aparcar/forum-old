					<p>A few suggestions, in no particular order:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Write down a list of what you REALLY need to have on the router and stick to it!!!</p></li><li><p>Use a graphical disk analyzer like <a href="http://www.marzocca.net/linux/baobab/baobab-usage.html#baobab-folderscan">baobab</a> to analyze where is the bloat in the &quot;<em>build_dir/target_xxx/root-yyy</em>&quot; directory which contains an image of the device filesystem</p></li><li><p>There are tuning options in the menuconfig to strip unnecessary export from the kernel/functions from libraries in the &quot;Global Build settings&quot;, with the drawback that you will not be able to extend the system without reflashing it completely (no support for add-on kernel modules/new executable programs)</p></li><li><p>In the same menu, check the option &quot; Remove ipkg/opkg status data files in final images&quot;, with the drawback that you will not be able to remove the basic packages one by one using &quot;opkg&quot;</p></li><li><p>Build a kernel with only the minimal required features, removing all debug options, core dump support, shadow password support</p></li><li><p>If possible, try to use the busybox equivalent of a standalone program, they are usually much smaller</p></li><li><p>In busybox, remove all bells and whistles, like verbose messages, history in shell, fancy prompts, large file support, obsolete features, locale/Unicode support, tab completion, use of ioctl names rather than hex values</p></li></ul><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.marzocca.net/linux/baobab/figures/baobab_fullscan.png" alt="Baobab Graphical Disk Usage Analyzer" /></span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 11 Nov 2012, 17:47)</p>

If not, I agree that you can find smaller, cheaper and more capable TL-WR703N routers with 4+32MB for $21 on eBay!</p>									</div>

					<p>By the way, the build i am making is for using as a <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Repeater_Bridge">repeater bridge</a>, in other words for 1) a reverse access point (lan accesses via wlan), 2) a wifi repeater. Currently I am using dd-wrt for this but having some issues, and want to put openwrt on it. That is why I took out things like ppp, dnsmasq, even iptables (which i dont know if is a good idea but can always change it :-) ).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hhm1</strong> on 13 Nov 2012, 05:58)</p>
