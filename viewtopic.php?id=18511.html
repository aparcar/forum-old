					<p>Hi Salepo,</p><p>let me try to help you come to a solution. (I am running an OpenWRT 8.09 system here, so not everything I describe here might work on a version 7 system)</p><p>First, log on to the router with SSH. Then search for the place where syslogd gets started on boot:</p><p>grep -ir syslog /etc</p><p>This will show that it gets started in /etc/init.d/boot. Open the file in vi and see where it gets called. You will find a line similar to the following:</p><p>syslogd -C${log_size:-16} ${log_ip:+-L -R $log_ip}</p><p>As we can see here, syslog gets called with a couple of parameters supplied. But none of them describe a log file. So it seems that using the default configuration system of OpenWRT, you are not able to define a log file. If you would want to use a log file, you could modify the startup script yourself. To find out what parameters syslogd accepts, try running &quot;syslogd --help&quot; . You could make the line that calls syslog look like this:</p><p>syslogd -C${log_size:-16} ${log_ip:+-L -R $log_ip} -O /tmp/syslog.log</p><p>Remember to reboot after modifying the file. But this is probably not what you want, because the logfile will eventually fill up the device on which /tmp is mounted. The smart thing to do would be:</p><p>- install a syslog server on some machine with enough storage;<br />- configure OpenWRT with the remote syslog server to which the logs would be sent;</p><p>The easiest way to configure OpenWRT to use a syslog server is to use the Luci or X-WRT webinterface. You can find it somethere in the system settings. Alternatively , you could do it using SSH: (the following example is for 8.09)</p><p>- Log in to the router<br />- Check the system settings (not necessary, but usefull to see what you already have configured):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci show|grep system <br />&nbsp; You should see something like:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; system.@system[0]=system<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; system.@system[0].hostname=sokko2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; system.@system[0].zonename=Europe/Amsterdam<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; system.@system[0].timezone=CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ucitrack.@system[0]=system<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ucitrack.@system[0].init=led<br />- Now set the logserver address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci set system.@system[0].logip=&lt;ipofyoursyslogserver&gt;<br />- Commit the changes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; uci commit<br />- Reboot</p><p>This should work (untested). Another option: If your machine running OpenWRT supports USB devices, then you could plug in a USB flash disk, mount it and log to that device.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>Johnny</p>									</div>
