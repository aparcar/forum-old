					<p>The LEDE project has support for TD-W8968 (See <a href="https://lede-project.org/toh/hwdata/tp-link/tp-link_td-w8968_v3)">https://lede-project.org/toh/hwdata/tp- â€¦ -w8968_v3)</a></p><p>You could check the device page, see what ICs and components are used, and then compare these to the hardware that is on your own router. Who knows, perhaps it is a simple process of porting the current v3 implementation to work on the v4.</p><p>You will also need to understand that neither OpenWRT nor LEDE specially employ people who port these firmwares to new platforms. Most of the time it is individual people who want to use either firmware on their own router, and they wrap up the sleeves and Get It Done(tm).</p><p>Thus, your best bet in getting OpenWRT to your router is to do it yourself.
