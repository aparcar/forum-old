					<p>Hi there, I came up with the idea of porting linux to a home router for a project at my university, and then i found out about the open- and dd-wrt projects (personally i&#039;m a fan of open-wrt).</p><p>while i could get all your source code and compile it, it doesn&#039;t give me a whole lot to write about when i&#039;m done. What I want to know is any tips or pitfalls i might encounter when compiling a kernel for a router eg. Linksys WRT54GL completely from scratch. As in source downloaded from kernel.org and then using buildroot to create the cross compilers.</p><p>Also what&#039;s the best method for flashing this kernel and any attached filesystem to the device itself?</p><p>What are the details of the BIOS or BSP for this particular board?</p><p>Anyone&#039;s thoughts are appreciated<br />Thanks</p><p>Will</p>									</div>

					<p>If you look at the OpenWrt sources you&#039;ll find fairly new kernels in the 2.6 branch, so I don&#039;t really know what you are trying to achieve (since it&#039;s already been done by others and all you&#039;d do is more or less replicate their efforts).</p>									</div>

					<p>Because I want to do it? I don&#039;t see why everyone&#039;s solution to this so far has just been &quot;use the openwrt kernel&quot; thats exactly what i&#039;m trying not to do.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not just the kernel. You need the whole ecosystem. I hope you realise that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. You could take a look at Cross Linux From Scratch, I believe they have a MIPS branch.</p>									</div>

					<p>i&#039;m not sure i know what you mean by ecosystem, but as far as the filesystem and driver modules etc go, i&#039;m up for doing it totally from scratch. i just wanted some pointers from anyone who might have had a go before. (by pointers i don&#039;t mean char*)</p><p>if i compile kamikaze from source and then flash it to my router using the included script, that isn&#039;t exactly a lot of work you know?</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re right. But building a kernel will get you only halfway, and to build a kernel you&#039;ll need a suitable environment. x86 kernels are built in x86 environments, MIPS kernels are built in MIPS environments - be they chroots or emulators or real MIPS systems;</p><p>By the sound of it you have some reading up to do.</p>									</div>
