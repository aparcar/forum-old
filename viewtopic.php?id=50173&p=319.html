					<p>Is there a way to do a &quot;reset to factory defaults&quot; with the WRT1900AC without using the reset button? Ever since I unbricked my router a few months ago, the reset button on the back doesn&#039;t do anything. I did try flashing 15.05-rc3 after seeing references to it having more stable wireless than the final, and found that when I went to set the keyphrase for 5GHz. security, it was already set to the root password, and would not allow me to change that keyphrase from the router&#039;s root user password. No problem with the 2.4GHz. security keyphrase, it just took what I typed, as it should. </p><p>I tried lots of different things, including going back to the stock firmware on boot partition 1, and using the GUI there to reset back to factory defaults. Then reflashed rc3 before doing any configuration in the stock firmware, and found that when the time came to set the keyphrase for 5GHz. security, same problem. The 5GHz. wireless security keyphrase was already set to the root user&#039;s password, and I couldn&#039;t change it. I even tried changing the root password, but it would still only let me use the old root password for the 5GHz. for the keyphrase, and was preset in the field. Never seen anything like that before. I also tried flashing the latest stock firmware from stock firmware in boot partition 1, and then when that came up, resetting to factory from the GUI in it. And then going back to the boot partition 1 stock firmware and re-flashing rc3. Again, same problem in setting the 5GHz. security keyprhase. Spookie stuff.</p><p>So the only thing that I can think of is to return to factory defaults while using OpenWRT on the router, but I don&#039;t have a working reset button.</p><p>Just on the chance that I used the wrong flash image, this is the one that I used:</p><p>openwrt-15.05-rc3-mvebu-armada-xp-linksys-mamba-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>md5 checksum:</p><p>db80d2c26c02eb400b926e8f055de940 *openwrt-15.05-rc3-mvebu-armada-xp-linksys-mamba-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>Although I&#039;d probably have just bricked the router if I had used the wrong image, and it isn&#039;t bricked. Just really weird when I try to use this version of OpenWRT.</p><p>Any ideas on how I could do a reset to factory defaults in Openwrt rc3? Stock firmware still works fine, this problem with not being able to change the 5GHz. security keyphrase in OpenWRT away from the root user&#039;s password just has me totally stumped.</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RogerSC</strong> on 4 Oct 2015, 11:48)</p>
