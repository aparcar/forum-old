					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am trying to compile the newest Trunk but the image file for flashing is not being created for my DIR-615 C1 (only the generic one). No errpr seems to be happening, my revision is 31468.</p><p>The r31441 compiled with no problems, but it is lacks active connection tracking.</p><p>Any idea what is the problem?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>From what I have seen on here for a while now it is unlikely someone will post to help you with such an issue as it&#039;s usually down to you to figure out the problem or possibly such an issue has been previously discussed enough that a search should find the answer.</p><p>Of course with OpenWRT having such a steep learning curve it can be difficult to diagnose problems or search for relevant posts.</p><p>I have learned that sometimes it is necessary to try cleaning up when problems arise. I know very little about your problem so I don&#039;t know if it is necessary. You must decide if it is necessary. You can read about cleaning up:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#cleaning.up">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#cleaning.up</a></p><p>Also keeping a copy of source downloads is a time saver when you feel it is necessary to try a distclean so before trying it you would move the dl folder to the parent folder for example:</p><p>~/openwrt/trunk$ mv dl ..<br />~/openwrt/trunk$ make distclean<br />~/openwrt/trunk$ ln -s ../dl</p><p>Sometimes you will decide a clean up isn&#039;t necessary and you can choose to revert back to a known working version in case the latest trunk is currently broken. You can choose to wait until the next day and update to the latest again with the hope it is working again.</p><p>Also you can browse the latest changeset by going here:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset</a></p><p>You can work backwards by clicking &quot;? Previous Changeset&quot; and hopefully you will get an idea of what may have caused a problem for you.</p>									</div>
