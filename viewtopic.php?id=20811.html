					<p>Hi, the solution is to do a:<br />make distclean</p><p>After switching from trunk revision &lt;16606 to one &gt;16606.</p><p>Florian further explained the change to the floating point emulation:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hi,</p><p>Since changesets 16606 and 16607 we have switched to using software floating <br />point emulation in the toolchain and we disabled the in-kernel FPU Emulator <br />in the MIPS kernel by default.</p><p>The rationale behind this is :<br />- the FPU emulator of the kernel is slow and works by catching floating point <br />operations exceptions, emulating them and continuing its work<br />- software floating point emulation is only added when a program needs it and <br />will not bloat fixed point programs (most) with software floating point code, <br />additionnaly software floating point is faster due to the absence of the <br />exception mechanism<br />- for consistency, other targets (arm, powerpc) also use software floating <br />point</p><p>This allows us to have a kernel which is slightly smaller (~ 1%) and faster, <br />and since most programs do not use floats, their memory footprint do not <br />change while programs using float have a slightly bigger one as they require <br />software floating point emulation. Still the tradeoff is worth <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>The &quot;bad&quot; effect is that you have to recompile your mips/mipsel toolchain AND <br />kernel otherwise you will get a device which boots the kernel then silently <br />fails while running busybox (the later using floats).</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention.<br />-- <br />Best regards, Florian Fainelli</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>Yes, Gabor dumped the whole firmware and made a bin file of the bootloader. But i still haven&#039;t found a way to write it over the &quot;edimax-style&quot; bootloader we used until now. If you know how to do it, please post it here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>However, today i built an image with madwifi and parprouted, removing some busybox applets.

					<p>Hi hede2,<br />I don&#039;t think anyone is actually using OpenWRT on 5GXi. Unfortunately, the only way is to reduce the readonly patition of OpenWRT... removing kernel components, some busybox tools, etc... but doing so would make OpenWRT useless (no iptables, no wpa-supplicant or something else).</p><p>An alternative could be soldering a USB port and to connect a mass storage device to have plenty of space for jffs2 partition. But there&#039;s no USB pin headers on the board.</p><p>Maybe a SD over GPIO? Or something like a storage over the serial port (but it would be probably too slow)... any ideas dudes?</p><p>Mattia</p>									</div>

					<p>What a pity.</p><p>But it&#039;s some kind of device not suitable to be a primary routing device. So there&#039;s a high chance there are other network devices in range with plenty of space.
