					<p>Hai,</p><p>I read from Wikipedia that OpenWRT is a linux distribution and is used in Routers and all. can any one please tell me whether it is a firmware or an RTOS. Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure what you mean with your question. Firmware or RTOS?<br />Openwrt uses the linux kernel and the linux kernel is not optimized for realtime operations. There are some ways to optimize it for (at least soft) realtime operations, but I think openwrt is optimized for performance. So, openwrt is not a RTOS. <br />And if openwrt is a fimware?? For my unterstanding/definition of firmware, I would say it depends on where the systemfiles are stored. If you have a device where you flash openwrt into the internal flash, you could say openwrt is a firmware. If you run it from the harddrive of an i386-pc-hardware I would say it&#039;s an operatingsystem.&nbsp; ... but in my opinion it doesn&#039;t really matter how you call it, just enjoy that you can install it almost everywhere <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hai @eleon216,</p><p>Almost all embedded RTOS will be ported to device Flash memory(NOR or NAND). so how can you say that it is firmware simply because it is loaded in the flash memory of a device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mostly the definition of firmware is &quot;software stored on hardware.&quot; such as on a ROM chip. I&#039;d consider OpenWRT a firmware replacement for most devices, sure. Since if you&#039;re having issues with your Linksys you&#039;d download a &quot;Firmware upgrade&quot; from the manufacturer. The memory is mostly read-only with the exception that it&#039;s electronically erasable and re-programmable.</p>									</div>

If it is an embedded device you could say openwrt is a firmware, and if it is a pc you will say it is an OS. But that are just names, and this defininitions were more destinctiv 20 years ago, when you were not able to run a full featured operation system on a&nbsp; so called &quot;embedded device&quot;. <br />And especially with openwrt it is hard to draw this line. Most users consider their wifi-router as some embedded device on which some &quot;firmware&quot; is running, and they have limited control over the hardware.&nbsp; If you put openwrt on it you get a full featured operating system and you have full control over your hardware, but it is still an embedded device and the programmcode running on it can still be called its firmware. so in this case you can say openwrt is a firmware. but where is the point?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 21 Jun 2011, 00:00)</p>

					<p>&quot;Optimized for performance&quot; = written to be fast as possible. But slowdowns can happen.<br />RTOS = written to react at&nbsp; events in very strict time constraints. If slowdowns happen = catastrophe.</p>									</div>
