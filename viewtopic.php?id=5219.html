					<p>I have a working dual serial port mod. My goal here is to send serial data to some embedded applications, like a PIC or Basic Stamp for general development. Basically they need 9600 bps. I can get this fine by default from serial port 1, having successfully communicated to a PIC controlling an LCD. However, this is not the case on serial port 0. My initial response was I hooked something up wrong, so I used my oscilloscope and saw a faint spike when I sent commands via port 0. I changed my timing and when my window was made much shorter, I got what looked like normal serial data. This means the port is configured to run at a much faster setting, and may realted to the serial console. To change the speed I tried typing stty or setserial, but neither exist in OpenWRT, so I&#039;m at a bit of a loss here.</p>									</div>
