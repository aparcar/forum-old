					<p>i can connect to bt wifi x hotspot using theese instructions but lede not working with settings<br />Configuring the 802.1X connection on Windows<br />In order to enable the automatic BT Wi-Fi login from a Windows machine, you need to manually create the wireless profile.</p><p>To start with, you will need to add the BT 802.1X certificate to your trusted certificate store:</p><p>Double-click the &quot;8021x.bt.com.cer&quot; file in Windows Explorer.<br />The certificate will be shown. Verify that it is issued to &quot;8021x.bt.com&quot; and that it is issued by &quot;Symantec Class 3 Secure Server SHA256 SSL CA&quot;. <br />If you downloaded the certificate from above and you wish to perform a further check on the certificate, then go into the Details tab and check that the Signature is &quot;68 fe 1a 76 fc 2c ef a2 05 22 3f e4 7b 39 0a 9c&quot;. <br />Please note that this is correct as of the time of writing, but the certificate is only valid until Sunday 16 December 2018. At this time, BT will likely issue a new certificate and the above serial number will change.<br />On the &quot;General&quot; tab, click the &quot;Install Certificate...&quot; button.<br />In &quot;Store Location&quot;, select &quot;Local Machine&quot; and click &quot;Next&quot;. You may be presented with a UAC privilege prompt. Confirm that you wish to continue.<br />When asked, select &quot;Place all certificates in the following store&quot;.<br />Click &quot;Browse&quot;, and select &quot;Trusted Root Certification Authorities&quot;.<br />Click &quot;OK&quot;.<br />Click &quot;Next&quot;, and then &quot;Finish&quot; to confirm.<br />Now that you have the BT 802.1X certificate installed and trusted, you can now configure the wireless profile to connect to &quot;BTWifi-X&quot; hotspots: </p><p>Go into &quot;Control Panel&quot;, and then into &quot;Network &amp; Sharing Center&quot;.<br />Click &quot;Set up a new connection or network&quot;.<br />When prompted, select &quot;Manually connect to a wireless network&quot; and then click &quot;Next&quot;.<br />In &quot;Network Name&quot;, enter: BTWifi-X<br />In &quot;Security Type&quot;, select &quot;WPA2-Enterprise&quot;. <br />Make sure that &quot;Start this connection automatically&quot; is checked, and click &quot;Next&quot;.<br />When prompted, click &quot;Change connection settings&quot;.<br />In the &quot;Security&quot; tab, under &quot;Choose a network authentication method&quot;, select &quot;Microsoft: EAP-TTLS&quot;.<br />Click the &quot;Settings&quot; button next to &quot;Microsoft: EAP-TTLS&quot;.<br />Under &quot;Connect to these servers&quot;, enter: 8021x.bt.com<br />Under &quot;Trusted Root Certification Authorities&quot;, place a checkbox next to &quot;8021x.bt.com&quot;.<br />On the same dialog box, uncheck &quot;Enable identity privacy&quot; so that it is disabled.<br />Make sure that &quot;Unencrypted password (PAP)&quot; is selected under &quot;Select a non-EAP method for authentication&quot;.<br />Click &quot;OK&quot; to return back to the &quot;BTWifi-X Wireless Network Properties&quot; dialog.<br />Click the &quot;Advanced settings&quot; button.<br />Place a check in the box next to &quot;Specify authentication mode&quot;, and then select &quot;User authentication&quot; in the drop-down box.<br />Click the &quot;Save Credentials&quot; button.<br />When prompted, enter the full username and password that you extracted from the &quot;mobileconfig&quot; file above. The username starts with 8021x:BTRcon/ and ends with some variation of your BT username. <br />Click &quot;OK&quot;, and then click &quot;OK&quot; twice more to close each dialog box. Finally, click &quot;Close&quot;.<br />You should now be able to connect to &quot;BTWifi-X&quot; from the wireless networks list. </p><p>Configuring the 802.1X connection on other platforms<br />I am unable to provide specific instructions for other platforms, such as Android, but the following configuration settings should be of use to power users wishing to configure this on their devices:</p><p>Wireless Service Set Identifier (SSID): BTWifi-X<br />Wireless authentication method: WPA2 Enterprise<br />Wireless authentication EAP protocol: EAP-TTLS<br />Inner EAP-TTLS authentication protocol: PAP<br />Identity Privacy: Disabled<br />Username: 8021x:BTRCon/newprof/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX:XXX-XXX (as above)<br />Password: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (as above)<br />Trusted Certificates: &quot;8021x.bt.com&quot; certificate (as above)<br />Trusted Server Certificate Names / Connect To Names: 8021x.bt.com</p>									</div>
