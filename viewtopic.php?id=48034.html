					<p>I didn&#039;t see this in the Wiki page, so I thought I&#039;d ask here. A while back I tried OpenWRT on the Kamikaze release and because it didn&#039;t have drivers for my switch it seemed to have been a brick since I don&#039;t have any soldering stuff available to me. So that meant no JTAG. Anyways, the router model was a WRT310N V1 and I have been waiting since. Does anybody know if this router does indeed function with the latest stable version of OpenWRT now? I have tried to find the information but as a huge newbie to this, it&#039;s all a bit daunting/deep.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
