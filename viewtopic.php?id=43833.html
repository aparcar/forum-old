					<p>I have a tecnical challenge for you guys and was wondering if you could me please.</p><p>I am trying to connect my camera, wirelessly from my camera to my IPAD.</p><p>There is a product called camranger which does this but costs Â£300 and the equipment they use is identical to the TP-Link MR3040 wireless router</p><p>My camera is a Nikon D3S (not the new D4 - which has an ethernet port).<br />The camera has the following connections - HDMI mini-pin connector, USB connector.</p><p>The TP-Link MR3040 wireless router has, 3G/4G USB port, ethernet port and micro USB connector.<br />Firmware 3.14.4 Build 121017 Release 62268n <br />Hardware version MR3040 V2 00000</p><p>I have an IPAD4 with retina screen, but it is NOT jail broken</p><p>What I want to do is to connect the router to the camera, take photos and have them appear on the IPAD - wirlessly</p><p>I have managed to connect the router to the IPAD - no problem there.</p><p>Where I am having difficulty is trying to get the photos transfered to the IPAD wirelessly.</p><p>Looking on the net, it seems that it is possible but it is not clear how. There seems some discussion on using openwrt but Im afraid I am not a tecchie Let me repeat, I am NOT a techie!!!</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><br /><p>Cheers</p><p>Pierre</p>									</div>

					<p>I am very much over my head on this, but I think I&#039;m getting an understanding...</p><p>If I get the TL-MR3040, and install OpenWRT, then gphoto it should - in theory - configure the device to control the camera and fetch images to my iPad.</p><p>The issue becomes software on the iPad that can make use of it.<br />What about using iUSBport or weyefeye&#039;s apps?<br />From what I understand, the CamRanger app is out because it requires a code from the device to work.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>
