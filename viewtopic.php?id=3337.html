					<p>I am having trouble calling ARP from my shells.&nbsp; I can call it fine from my command line, but once I put it in a shell, it doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Example of shell:</p><p>___________________________<br />|#!/bin/sh<br />|<br />|arp<br />___________________________</p><p>Obviously I want to do more with arp, but I need to be able to call arp first.&nbsp; On my Debian box, I can run that script fine and I know that arp is located at /usr/sbin/arp</p><p>However, I can&#039;t find the location on my Linksys.&nbsp; if I do a &quot;find / -name arp&quot; the only thing I get back is /proc/net/arp which is an empty text file as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; I am trying to write a simple script that will give back the Mac address of the wan gateway on IP up. </p><p>Maybe I need to change the heading of my script from #!/bin/sh to something else, but I am not sure what that something else is.</p><p>Thanx in advance for any help.&nbsp; I promise to post this to the mini howtos once I get it all figured out.</p>									</div>
