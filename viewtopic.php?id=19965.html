					<p>Hello everybody, today we can buy a Fonera 2.0 with the USB connector for 50 euros: <a href="https://shop.fon.com/FonShop/shop/ES/ShopController?view=product&amp;product=PRD-020">https://shop.fon.com/FonShop/shop/ES/Sh â€¦ ct=PRD-020</a></p><p>I think it is a good device for that price.</p><p>Has someone tested? I want to buy one, but first I want to be sure that is posible to install Openwrt.</p><p>Thanks for all!</p>									</div>

					<p>If this device still uses the same Atheros chipset with 16MB RAM, then I wouldn&#039;t recommend to invest your $$$ on it. I tried <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org">FreeSwitch</a> on my FON2100 and it crawled to a halt. With Asterisk-1.6.x, I encountered similar problem. On both counts, the <em>mtdblockd</em> process ate up all the CPU resources.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have one. I bought it when it was BETA and paid 39 euro. <br />Yes you can flash openwrt. It has 32 MB RAM and same cpu as fonera 2100, 2200 and 2201 (180Mhz).<br />You can find more details on openwrt wiki page.<br />I think 50 euro is too much for such a device. You can find newest N router with best cpu, 4 eth port starting from 60.</p>									</div>
