					<p>Hey guys, I&#039;m looking to replace the antenna with an external RP-SMA connection. I&#039;m comfortable with the solder of the coax but I don&#039;t know where to do it. On the front of the mainboard appears to be a ceramic chip antenna and on the back looks like a place where a UF.L connection would have gone. Any recommendations on which place I should start? </p><p>I&#039;ve included pictures of both. I have more pictures if anyone is interested. </p><p>Front<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.vsoutherner.com/images/front.png" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>Back<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.vsoutherner.com/images/back.png" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p>									</div>
