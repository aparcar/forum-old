					<p>I just tried to revert to original firmware from Chaos Calmer and bricked my router by the look of it.<br />I did read about the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#go_back_to_original_firmware">&quot;boot&quot;</a> images to avoid and used a stripped file.<br />But instead of using the &quot;sysupgrade&quot; command, I used the Web GUI. Is this what I did wrong? Or maybe I should have waited for more than two minutes?<br />I&#039;ve followed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#debricking">these instructions</a> but I couldn&#039;t connect to the router with telnet. I&#039;m not even sure if I can enter failsafe mode.<br />I know this is a serious problem because OpenWRT was mostly overwritten, but I&#039;m asking before I throw my only OpenWrt-capable router in the garbage.<br />Thank you for your attention.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Slackware</strong> on 8 Sep 2015, 23:35)</p>

					<p>Solved! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/cool.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cool" /><br />I had tried the TFTP method, but your answer made me try again more carefully, and it worked this time.<br />Thank you.</p><p>Details:<br />I pressed the reset button for 5 seconds after powering on the router.<br />I used Tftpd server. It was silent all the time. Only the LEDs signaled something different was going on.<br />The firmware file was named &quot;mr3420v2_tp_recovery.bin&quot;, as instructed on the wiki.<br />I started the server <strong>after</strong> setting the static IP configuration.<br />In the server GUI window, I selected &quot;192.168.0.66&quot; as &quot;Server interfaces&quot;.</p>									</div>
