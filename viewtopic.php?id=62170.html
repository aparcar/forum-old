					<p>Hello all..<br />I am implementing multiple language support in my OpenWRT based router.<br />I added support of both Russian and Chinese language by editing /etc/config/luci.<br />But, the problem is that only OpenWRT&#039;s built-in pages are being translated and not those lua pages and tabs which i have added in the router ..<br />How can i overcome this problem??</p>									</div>

					<p>Have a look into LuCI source tree on Github <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/luci">https://github.com/openwrt/luci</a> .<br />Every &quot;module&quot; and every &quot;application&quot; has it&#039;s own po/[LANG] directory with it&#039;s standard .po file for the given [LANG] and a template directory.<br />There is available LUCIPATH/build/i18n-scan.pl script which can scan the lua code for strings and create a standard .pot (PO-template) file.<br />This template can be used to create the final .po file.<br />Tools like &quot;poedit&quot; or others can handle and edit this files via GUI. There are a lot for Linux, OSx and Windows.<br />During build these .po files are &quot;compiled&quot; into the final *.lmo files using &quot;po2lmo&quot; tool.<br />This final *.lmo files are copied into usr/lib/lua/luci/i18n directory on the OpenWrt box.<br />That&#039;s the magic.</p>									</div>
