					<p>I am trying to take a backup firmware and trying to restore that same file again. But it seems current openwrt is not supporting restore functionality.&nbsp; System is just rebooting without applying the settings.<br />Could some one help me out with this, Is there any piece of code available to take a tar file from UI, save it in local machine and apply same tar file to the current config (restore functionality). It seems this piece of code is missing in openwrt. Please help me ASAP as i need to do this very urgently</p>									</div>
