					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I&#039;ve extracted the flash data from a couple of RT5350 routers, and now I&#039;d like to take a look around in the filesystem to see how they can get so much functionality in 4MB of Flash and 16MB of SDRAM.&nbsp; The devices in question are</p><p>HAME MPR-A1 clone (MPR-L8, such as Squonk was working on)<br /><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-MPR-L8-3-in-1-MPR-A1-3G-Wireless-Router-Mobile-power-supply-MINI/639608843.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shi â€¦ 08843.html</a></p><p>Hi-Link HLK-M04 <br /><a href="http://www.hlktech.net/product_detail.php?ProId=39">http://www.hlktech.net/product_detail.php?ProId=39</a></p><p>I&#039;ve dumped the SPI flash, binwalked it and extracted the squashfs filesystem, but they do not extract with any of the squashfs tools available in the firmware mod kit located at<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit/">http://code.google.com/p/firmware-mod-kit/</a></p><p>From a little browsing, I found Michael Coppola&#039;s post here about his device&#039;s filesystem with a similar shsq magic entry, and also his blog entry about a special version of unsquashfs made by netgear which could unpack it.&nbsp; See his post here:<br /><a href="http://www.poppopret.org/?p=204">http://www.poppopret.org/?p=204</a></p><p>But I cannot get this netgear tool to build.&nbsp; So - is anyone else working on a device that has the shsq style squashfs filesystem, and are able to unpack it with a commonly available tool?&nbsp; Or, has anyone had success building that netgear tool?&nbsp; Thanks in advance, I&#039;m out of ideas at the moment.</p>									</div>
