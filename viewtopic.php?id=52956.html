					<p>Hello,</p><p>I got into my hands a couple of Teacom GW600.<br />It seems to me a good hardware, and I&#039;d like to play with them.<br />I have already found the serial console and the USB storage direct access.<br />JTAG access seems to be more difficult.<br />I have few experiences with JTAG related stuff, so I&#039;d like to pose some questions.<br />I&#039;m quite sure to have found TMS, TDI, and TCK; but it seems there&#039;s no TDO.<br />Looking at the PCB, there&#039;s no JTAG header, and the PINs I think have found, are on some resistor connected to the 3.3v, which I identified as pullup resistors. <br />Question is: is it possible the resistors I have found are not pullup resistors, but just resistors which their only mean is bind these pin to high level, and therefore there&#039;s no TDO? Is it possible this PCB left TDO floating?<br />In this case, how can I to access the main flash?</p><p>Using OS, mtdblock0 is the only block device I can access, and it seems to me it is only a part of the whole flash memory. <br />In fact I can not see any place where the linux kernel image is stored. Also the flash chip is 4MB and the mtdblock0 image is just 3.2MB. <br />Main processor is a BCM6348, which I think have it&#039;s own flash memory within the SoC where the CFE Bootloader may be located, but kernel image still have to be somewhere else, and the only place, have to be the 0.8 MB I can&#039;t access using mtdblock.<br />Can someone point me where my thoughts fail or give me any direction on how to proceed?</p><p>Thank you fo any help<br />Regards <br />AC</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>acarminati</strong> on 26 Sep 2014, 23:08)</p>
