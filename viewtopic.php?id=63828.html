					<p>I have now enabled lots of things (much more than is certainly required) in the configuration and built again. The PCMCIA card is now recognised and works. The WIFI device is now recognised, I can see it in luci, and I can perform a network scan and see many WIFI networks. However I am unable to connect to any of them and it doesn&#039;t work when I enable it as an AP.

					<p>I have been back into the configs and disabled everything that I think is unnecessary for my hardware, and anything else that I don&#039;t think is being used. I changed a number of &#039;m&#039; settings to &#039;*&#039; and added &#039;wpad&#039;.I think that is about it. Built and loaded onto the laptop and now all the interfaces appear to be working, I can connect it as a client onto my existing WIFI network and it also seems to be working as a WIFI AP. I will be doing some more testing to check everything. Here is my current config.</p><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/LPpkPfxY">http://pastebin.com/LPpkPfxY</a> </p><p>I&#039;d like to get it back to generic x86, rather than a custom build. I guess I will need to go back to the generic config and then just enable the bits that seem to be required for the hardware and then perhaps some of these defaults could be incorporated into the official build? And how to go about requesting it?</p><p>As a note, I am connected with my laptop to the internet via OWRT on the mentioned laptop (as a WIFI router) as I write this. So I can say that this is some what a success.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 1 Apr 2016, 19:57)</p>

					<p>I have since ditched the HDD out of this machine (has a problem with &#039;waiting for /dev/sda2&#039;), and now have a 4GB USB memory stick. I didn&#039;t think that this laptop would boot from USB but it does. Since doing this I am no longer compiling the sources from scratch and have moved over to the Image Builder which is far better/less time consuming/more generic&nbsp; than compiling the sources and I can get all of the hardware working with the appropriate &#039;kmod&#039; files and &#039;opkg&#039; works for release builds of packages (which used to complain about the source build kernel). I would recommend this as the way to go if you are building an image for a laptop.</p>									</div>
