					<p>OpenVPN can make use of kernel modules if you enable cryptodev. So you can take them in your setup too. Especially on devices with hardware crypto this will unleash a lot of power.</p><p>As openssl tries to avoid cache timing attacks (in case of multiuser environments) its AES software implementation usually is optimized for constant time and not speed. If you have a look at the comments at <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/aes/asm/aes-ppc.pl">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/aes/asm/aes-ppc.pl</a> you will see that AES is throttled at 50% for PPC implementation (e.g. WDR4900v1). Even the basic aes-generic kernel module should be faster. The same should apply for other architectures.</p><p>That said comparing the new modules with the openssl benchmark page the to be expected raw speedup factors (without network) for 1K blocks on WDR4900v1 should be: </p><p>AES: 2x faster - because of constant openssl implementation<br/>SHA1: 2.6x faster - not prone to timing attacks<br/>SHA256: 2x faster - not prone to timing attacks</p>									</div>

Though adblock plus slows things down, it does allow me to go to all the websites I want to browse. The biggest problem for me is that sometimes I do need links to things as hotels, plane tickets and such and a lot of times the addblocking in the router blocks those sites as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>A much bigger issue i&#039;m having is that sometimes pages dont complete their request successfully. I get &quot;error empty response&quot; or just nothing.. This usually happens in Wordpress admin.</p><p>First i thought it was my hosting provider and it frustrated me a lot trying to solve it from their end. Anyone else noticed this? Im on wndr3700.</p><p>BTW does anyone know a firmware likes this for the wndr3700 but 100% stable without major issues? Thanks!</p>									</div>
