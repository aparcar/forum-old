					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m a newbie, so please be patient.</p><p>A bit of history first<br />I&#039;ve got a TL-WR1043ND which I bricked last night. I tried to install OpenWrt, but the WAN port would not work. I did not want to work on it the whole night, so I wanted to restore the factory firmware.<br />On the Wiki page (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a>) it says that you need to shorten the factory file if it starts with boot (which it does), but that did not work.</p><p>From the related forum topic (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=110583#p110583">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 83#p110583</a>) supertom64 wrote that the firmware started at 0x20200 with a specific code. When I opened op my file, that code was at 0x00000 in my file, so I tried to flash the router with the complete firmware file.<br />As could be expected, my router is now bricked <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>While searching for a solution, I came across this topic on the DD-Wrt forum: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.de/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=730069&amp;sid=7194a9750de1ec5caf2b527fd040ab2a">http://www.dd-wrt.de/phpBB2/viewtopic.p … 7fd040ab2a</a></p><p>I&#039;ve got the same problem and I want to try the duplicate the solution.</p><p>My questions are:<br />Do you have any advice on the cable I should use (and if you&#039;re from the Netherlands, where I could buy one) or if I could make it my self?<br />Do you have any other advice?</p><p>I&#039;m first going to fetch my old WiFi router from my parents house, so my wife won&#039;t kill me when she wakes up.</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gbsmulders</strong> on 5 Jan 2013, 13:33)</p>

As most PCs don&#039;t have serial ports any more, you need to get one. Probably easiest and quickest is to buy a cheap USB-to-serial converter with cables.</p><p>When I had to debug my router in November, I bought a cheap serial converter from Ebay. Look for something like that.<br /><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/290526138405">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/290526138405</a><br /><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/270805125757">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/270805125757</a><br />(separate cable threads with individual headers is probably better than a single cable with 4-5 pin connector, as the pin orders vary.)</p><p>You might also find something similar in local computer shops/e-shops.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 5 Jan 2013, 14:34)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the advice.</p><p>First of all, I&#039;ve installed my old WiFi router and my wife didn&#039;t kill me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I ordered a converter on eBay for € 4,20 (inc. shipping).<br />When it&#039;s in, I&#039;ll try to debrick my router.<br />I hope it works. My current router works fine, but it&#039;s a lot slower.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>
