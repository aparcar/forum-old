					<p>i was wondering if i could just but the WRTSL54GS and have all the options that i would get if i had bought the NSLU2 and a WRT54GS.<br/>i like the idea of having network attached storage with multiple HDD configured in a big raid.&nbsp; running samba, pbx software, slimbox, and routing fuctions such as QOS.</p><p>if that sounds like it could work could someone point me in the right direction to get me started.</p>									</div>
