					<p>Hi there. I have created my own AA build using OpenWRT Buildroot. It works great, however there are dependancy problems. I can fix them by also compiling the packages that I require at the same time that the AA is built. However, there are like 3000 packages and the only way I can see to compile every package is to manually select EVERY package during the build process (in menuconfig). This will take forever :-( Is there an easier way to compile EVERY package, as an OPKG, during the build of AA? Or is it a completely manual process to select every OPKG!?</p><p>Thanks in advance.<br />DJ</p>									</div>
