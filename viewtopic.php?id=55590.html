					<p>Found a link to this and it sounds pretty interesting. There&#039;s a reddit discussion where one of the firmware developers claims that OpenWrt builds will be available for those that don&#039;t want to use their cloud-based firmware. That makes me think their own firmware probably is also OpenWrt-based. Hardware sounds pretty powerful too compared to most of the current market. Preorder price is $125, which is really not bad. Retail will be $199.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://www.eero.com">http://www.eero.com</a><br />Specs:<br />- 1.0 GHz dual core processor (ARM, probably according to Wired)<br />- 512MB RAM<br />- 1GB Flash<br />- 2x Gigabit ethernet<br />- Dual 802.11a/b/g/n/ac radios (confirmed: two separate 5GHz radios, not just 2.4GHz+5GHz)<br />- Bluetooth 4.0/Low Energy</p><p>I&#039;m not affiliated with this company in any way, but thought there might be some interest here. It really is aimed at simplifying things, while being a lot more stable and reliable than most manufacturer stock firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Formal confirmation of OpenWrt support:<br /><a href="https://www.eero.com/developers#">https://www.eero.com/developers#</a></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Every eero also has OpenWrt compatibility. Use the USB port to quickly switch to running OpenWrt. We believe that you should have the freedom to do anything on the hardware. If simple setup and automatic configuration isn&#039;t your style, do your own thing on our awesome 802.11ac hardware. It has the guts you need.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
