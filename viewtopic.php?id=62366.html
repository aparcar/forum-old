					<p>Hello community,<br />I have three routers to send to someone in Germany. As a present for your great work. These three routers are at the moment &quot;free&quot; like free beer, but you have the abilities to make them &quot;free&quot; as in freedom!<br />The three routers are: Telekom Speedport W303V Typ B, Telekom Speedport W504V Typ A, Vodafone DSL EasyBox 802. All of them have AC adapters. The W303V bricked itself, when this thing tried to update automatically. Maybe your command line skills can revive it. I own the boxes with manuals, so tell me if you need them. Do you need the extra cables like short LAN cables, telephone cables? If there is place in the package, I put them in.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Adra</p><p>Edit: I will send the package to European Union countries. I pay for the package.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adra</strong> on 7 Feb 2016, 23:37)</p>
