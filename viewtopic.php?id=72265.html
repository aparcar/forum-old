					<p>I&#039;ve been messing with that for a couple of days on and off using mjpg_streamer and it&#039;s totally flaky. <br />Any time I try to hit the url of the web server, I get a segfault. <br />If I connect the camera after the router is booted, it crashes it and it reboots again.</p><p>Just flaky and cannot find enough information to fix the problem. Besides, mjpg_streamer is a jpeg method and I&#039;d like to find a real streaming method. I figured if there is a camera already on the market that can run openwrt, that would be a head start.</p><p>The two things I wanted to play with are using the mini router with a usb cam broadcasting h.264 over IP. <br />The other thing I wanted was to try and find a usb device that has A/V inputs which can work with openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>tmo26, is there any chance you might have some links to share?<br />What I&#039;m looking for is a way to use an openwrt based device to convert USB video to an h.264 stream to be used with something like zoneminder.</p>									</div>

					<p>I read a lot of older posts and other forums about using mini routers with usb cams for example but maybe these days, people don&#039;t bother and go directly to IP cams and video servers.</p><p>Basically, I just wanted to try using openwrt as the OS to convert USB video to Onvif IP to be used with external controls such as zoneminder.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projects</strong> on 11 Oct 2017, 01:21)</p>
