					<p>I know.<br />There&#039;s at least 3 raised topics so far.</p><p>However I am badly needing arp-scan.</p><p>According to all the resources online, this tool exists as a precompiled package in the repository.</p><p>However I was not able to find it for neither version of OpenWRT and for neither arch.</p><p>Moreover when I tried to configure it using the toolchain (for MIPS &amp; x86), I&#039;ve got tons of errors for missing libraries.<br />So far so good.</p><p>Tried to configure with the SDK: got error messages for missing libpcap_open_live support. The libpcap headers are in place... so there&#039;s no reason to complain.</p><p>Tried the buildroot as a last option. The package is totally missing from the feeds. Once I edit the feeds.conf like this:</p><p>src-git packages <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages.git">https://github.com/openwrt/packages.git</a></p><p>the package shows. However I am not able to compile it. The compile process just enters directory, then leaves it.</p><p>And that&#039;s all.</p><p>I&#039;ll be grateful if someone compile that one statically for x86 &amp; MIPS. (I&#039;ll be running it on various platforms and OpenWRT versions)</p><p>Or at least give me step-by-step guide how to do it myself.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
