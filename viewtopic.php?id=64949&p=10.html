					<p>David, I switched from DD-WRT to your LEDE build, and I want to say thanks for all the work, as I favor LEDE/OpenWRT over DD-WRT. As I have read, you now build packages by request. I saw your newer build, and saw that some packages that I used are no longer in the repo. As such, I have not updated yet. Could you add the zabbix_agentd package, the 3 zabbix_extra packages, and the full edition of wpad to the repo? I use Zabbix for monitoring and WPA2-Enterprise for my network.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>By the way...&nbsp; Simple testing I&#039;ve done around the house shows Wifi working better than the last build. Not that it was bad before, far from it.

					<p>@moccolo</p><p>Depending on where you are in the AC frequency spectrum, some frequencies are licensed for additional power. I believe the last 2 or 3 channels at the end of the spectrum are rated legally for 1000mW or 1Watt. This would be US regulations, but am assuming you are USA.</p>									</div>
