					<p>I have a Mikrotik RB2011 on which I have, after a certain amount of hassle, managed to install OpenWrt 14.07 from trunk.</p><p>It&#039;s running OK except that I can&#039;t work out the mapping between the OpenWrite names for the ports and the actual physical ethernet connectors. In particular I can&#039;t work out which is the WAN port.&nbsp; As the RB2011 has 10 ethernet sockets this makes things a bit confusing!</p><p>I can understand that br-lan is a &#039;logical&#039; name for the ports on the LAN, then there&#039;s several VLAN interfaces.&nbsp; eth1 seems to be the five &#039;fast ethernet&#039; sockets but I can&#039;t really work out what eth0.1 (LAN) eth0.2 (WAN) and eth0.3 (SFP) are.&nbsp; Well, eth0.3 is presumably the SFP interface I guess. However how do eth0.1 and eth0.2 map onto the five Gigabit connectors and where is this configured?</p>									</div>
