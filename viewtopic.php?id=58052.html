					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have installed an OpenWrt on TP-Link MR3020 and I&#039;m using it together with Vodafone K4505 USB 3G dongle. Both are supported officially.</p><p>However, when I try to connect to the Internet, it doesn&#039;t go further than &quot;Connecting...&quot;. The modem flashes as it registered in the network, the modem is listed in the GUI as Vodafone (Huawei), I even can see a signal strength and work with SMS messages on the SIM card... In the system logs I see &quot;Attemping to connect...&quot; and that&#039;s all. Have tried different providers (SIM cards) and also custom builds e.g. ofmodemsandmen.</p><p>The only thing I need to specify is an APN, others my provider requires to leave blank. I&#039;ve played with Authenication method but no luck.</p><p>It is worth to mention the stock firmware for my rooter works flawlessly with this modem.</p><p>Any ideas are much appreciated.</p>									</div>
