					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I have been messsing with Kamikaze 7.09 of OpenWRT on my recently bought Buffalo WHR-G54S and cannot seem to get wireless with DHCP to work.</p><p>I have changed in /etc/config/wireless the line of &quot;option disabled 1&quot; and commented it out, now wireless shows up.</p><p>I can connect to it, but i cannot get an IP address.</p><p>If i manually specify an IP address on the laptop/psp, etc. i can connect to the internet and browse etc, but without manually specifying, i get nothing.</p><p>What do i need to change to get DHCP working for wireless?</p><p>--</p><p>Also on another note, i am also unable to find any information on how to change the device into pure AP mode, so that my other router dishes out the IP&#039;s, etc via DHCP and this Buffalo just passes it on instead of using router mode and just dish out its own ip range, etc.</p><p>Also, i cannot manage to change the IP range/subnet for when it is in router mode.</p><p>This is probably documented elsewhere but i have wasted countless hours at work, at home &amp; while travelling to try and find this information out with no success <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>--</p><p>Also does anyone have scripts to be execute upon side &quot;Mode&quot; button change between AP &amp; Auto?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>morphix</strong> on 27 Apr 2008, 06:18)</p>
