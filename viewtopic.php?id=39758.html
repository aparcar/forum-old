					<p>Hi</p><p>I am currently using openwrt backfire x86 on an intel atom system with a couple of 82574 ethernet controllers as lan and wan.</p><p>I have an external adsl modem (a dgn3500 used as modem) and I access it from openwrt in the standard way (lan network is set to 192.168.0.0/24, modem network is 192.168.2.0/24, wan has an alias with address 192.168.2.1, modem ip is 192.168.2.2).</p><p>My problem is that if the adsl connection on the modem is down, e.g. for some reasons it went down or I restarted it, I can&#039;t any longer access the modem, because any wan alias is shut down; I have to wait for the adsl to be up again or manually ifconfig the modem alias on wan</p><p>What can I do to prevent the eth0:1 modem alias of wan to be shut down when there is no adsl connection on the pppoe wan? Or might I automatically ifconfig eth0:1 somewhere?</p><p>thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alfie</strong> on 1 Oct 2012, 17:55)</p>
