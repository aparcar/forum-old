					<p>Hi all,</p><p>This is my first post and I realize it&#039;s a very noob question, but I&#039;m having a difficult time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using &quot;Image Builder&quot; that I compiled from Barrier Breaker to include custom scripts into my images.&nbsp; However, on my WDR3500 I have a known reboot issue that I can&#039;t wait for a fix to come into the main release.. I read up on it and there&#039;s a patch in place that works : <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17839#comment:58">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/17839#comment:58</a></p><p>However, I don&#039;t know how to apply the patch.&nbsp; In another forum someone mentioned just throwing it in the &quot;patches&quot; dir, but I don&#039;t have one.&nbsp; I also tried to apply the patch before compiling Image Builder with the patch -p0 &lt; *.patch command but it didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; </p><p>My main question is this.&nbsp; Is it even possible to apply a patch for &quot;Image Builder&quot;?&nbsp; If so, how can I go about doing it.&nbsp; Also, if the fix is in a .c file instead of .patch, how can that be used?</p><p>Thanks for your patience with me, I know it&#039;s a very beginner question!</p>									</div>

					<p>You cannot apply source code patches to the imagebuilder, as this merely repacks the final image from precompiled components.<br />To apply source code patches you need the entire buildroot environment and compile OpenWrt from ground up.</p>									</div>
