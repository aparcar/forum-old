					<p>Hi fellas.</p><p>Just got my buffalo AG300H upgraded to openwrt for using udpxy for my IPTV.</p><p>My Isp has provided me with a fiber internet connection ( static IP with 2 VLANs + 1 modem) , I have config my system like this :</p><p>Modem : DHCP server disable , IP = 192.168.100.1</p><p>Port 1 Modem (internet - no bridge) to AG300H WAN ( IP = 192.168.100.10)</p><p>Port 4 Modem (IPTV - bridged) to AG300H PORT 4 LAN , DHCP for LAN is enable and the range of IP is (192.168.1.x / pool=20) ; AG300H ip is 192.168.1.199</p><p>I have successfully installed udpxy on my AG300H ( checked with /status and its working fine with AG300H Ip accordingly) </p><br /><p>Now here is the problem, I have only managed to get udpxy work for once, but after that everytime I connect my computer to AG300H Lan port from 1-3,&nbsp; my PC always get IPTV which are (10.x.x.x) and not my supposed local IP (192.168.1.x) provided by AG300H LAN DHCP. Therefore, I can only watch IPTV through rtp:// link but not udpxy link.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to Force DHCP server on AG300H LAN but does not change anything, still my PC got IPTV ip. I think I might have done something wrong here so please shed me a light. I&#039;m a newb at this so sorry if my post is not clear.</p><p>Any help is appreciated, thanks.</p><br /><br /><p>PS:&nbsp; This is my setup script for udpxy :</p><p>START=99<br />STOP=10</p><p>IGMP_OPTS=&quot;-p 4022 -a 192.168.1.199 -m 192.168.1.199&quot;<br />IGMP_BIN=&quot;/usr/bin/udpxy&quot;<br />PID_F=&quot;/var/run/udpxy.pid&quot;</p><p>start() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo &quot;Starting udpxy&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; start-stop-daemon -S -x $IGMP_BIN -p $PID_F -b -m -- $IGMP_OPTS<br />}</p><p>stop() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo &quot;Stopping udpxy&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; start-stop-daemon -K -x $IGMP_BIN -p $PID_F -q<br />}</p><br /><br /><br /><p>And the firewall rules:</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;igmp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;udp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;224.0.0.0/4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _name &#039;multicast&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;all&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;224.0.0.0/4&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>It sounds like you bridged the IPTV VLAN onto your LAN (via both the modem and your openwrt router). So you&#039;ll be getting DHCP replies from your ISP&#039;s DHCP server on this VLAN. You&#039;re also running your own DHCP server. So you&#039;ve got two DHCP servers on the same broadcast domain: openwrt and your ISP. <strong>Don&#039;t do that. It&#039;s bad.</strong></p><p>You may want to remove openwrt port 4 from your LAN bridge/switch config, assign it to its own VLAN and run a DHCP <strong>client</strong> (not server) on this interface. Then you can bind udpxy to that interface, and your ISP&#039;s DHCP server won&#039;t leak onto your LAN.</p>									</div>
