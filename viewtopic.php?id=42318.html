					<p>Hi,</p><p>Has anyone here had any experience in working with a router manufacturer to preload a custom OpenWrt image in the factory? We have a need to buy several thousand routers at a time and would like to make our own image, supply it to the factory where it can be loaded before it is shipped to us. If anyone has had any experience with this I would love to hear about it. Is it a service that many manufacturers offer, or do they avoid this type of thing? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you will not succeed, I can write you a curl based scipt, which will flash the router automatically once you connect it. All you will have to do is to connect a router to computer and wait for leds to blink, but you will need about 4 minutes per router including unpacking, connecting and packing back anyway, but you can hire some loser who could do this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> With more ethernet cards it should be possible to make more.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for those replies, I will try some of the manufacturers directly to see if they can offer that service. I would like to know what is involved in the curl script, if you have anything that you can share with me it would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s challenging, but doable within one days shift, even for a small company with 10 computers and 10 people willing to make such a work. With multiple NICs you can reduce the time/people needed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Maybe chris won&#039;t need them at once, but noone tells you can beat those chinese and indians <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Theres not much to share, because each script is device specific. Curl is a great tool for automatizing http requests, see <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">http://curl.haxx.se</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, thanks for the replies. I get it now, and I think the best approach is to buy 1000 as is and then update the firmware. No need to involve the manufacturer at all. I&#039;ll check out curl and I&#039;m pretty sure I can write some scripts for it. Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are still interested, maybe I can help. We are making routers for our own purpose and if our device fits your use, you could buy it and have it preloaded with your own firmware.</p>									</div>
