					<p>I&#039;m building my own Backfire images from SVN. One of the packages I&#039;ve select, miniupnpd, does not get enabled by default when the image is first booted. Specifically, no entry is created in /etc/rc.d/ for it. All the other packages are correctly enabled, even ones that I&#039;ve custom made (qos functionality) and placed in etc/init.d in my build_root. I&#039;ve been digging for a while but I can&#039;t seem to determine what would cause this one particular init script to not be enabled automatically?</p><p>I can enable it manually, and it stays enabled, but I&#039;m under the impression that the script should be enabled automatically.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmm...did some more digging. /rom/etc/rc.d shows that appropriate S95miniupnpd file. So, it is getting built properly. It looks like it is getting disabled by the luci-app-upnp application:</p><p><a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/changeset/6745/luci/branches/luci-0.10/applications/luci-upnp/root/etc/uci-defaults/luci-upnp">http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/changese â€¦ /luci-upnp</a></p><p>Not sure why LuCI is disabling this one?</p>									</div>

					<p>That once was due to security considerations but in the prebuilt case its not really useful, will see whether I can change it.</p>									</div>

					<p>jow, I&#039;ve filed a luci ticket. Its pending moderation. I also went ahead and filed an openwrt ticket as well, see:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10177">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10177</a></p><p>This proposes a change to the default upnpd.config file that will address the security concern I think the LuCI change was attempting to enforce, without the side effect of disabling it on prebuilt images where it is desirable to have it enabled by default.</p><p>Thanks for taking a look.</p>									</div>
