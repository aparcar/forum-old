					<p>I&#039;m a beginner with OpenWrt and I&#039;m wondering how to find out what the changes are between two versions of a package. For example, Barrier Breaker bundles version 2014-06-03-1 of the <em>hostapd-common</em> package and I see that an upgrade to 2014-06-03.1-1 is available. Given limited flash memory resources, I&#039;d rather not upgrade unless the changes are worth the cost. But where do I find the release notes for any given package (whether included in the base collection or not)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Generally speaking, there is no &quot;changelog&quot; for packages, packages&#039; code can come from all sort of maintainers keeping track of changes in various ways -- sometimes even not at all. Not all of it -- in fact only a small part -- is maintained by OpenWrt.</p><p>hostapd-common, however, is maintained by OpenWrt itself, and its changes can be tracked through the comments to the respective changesets. The change you are looking for is <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/42942/">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/42942/</a> -- that new revision you are seeing fixes <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3686">https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/deta â€¦ -2014-3686</a></p>									</div>
