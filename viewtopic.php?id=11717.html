					<p>I installed all of the firmware versions of Kamikaze that I could find last week (including the July 20th snapshot) on my wrtsl54gs and I could not get any of them to initialize the WAN port.&nbsp; I think that it has to do with the following two threads (http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8435 and <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10528">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10528</a> ).&nbsp; I added both serial and JTAG to the box last week and both work great (serial for seeing what is going on and JTAG for a new CFE as discussed here: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9101">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9101</a> .&nbsp; Although you probably do not need to go to the extent of adding JTAG in your case.&nbsp; For the mean time until Kamikaze gets fixed for the wrtsl54gs I have switched back to White Russian.</p><p>Your router is most likely NOT bricked, and I think you may be able to get to it at 192.168.1.1 on the LAN side using telnet.&nbsp; If you cannot telnet you should still be able to recover by tftp&#039;ing White Russian to it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Unfortunately, I&#039;m not able to recover anything...

					<p>Hi LoloMc,</p><p>&quot;SS-2.0-dropbear_0.49 in the command line terminal and the underscore blinking&quot; this is SSH and clearly indicates that your router is not seriously bricked.&nbsp; Try using putty (<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgta … nload.html</a>) from your XP box to connect to 192.168.1.1 (22=ssh 23=telnet).</p><p>As for tftp&#039;ing a new firmware you should read: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP?action=show&amp;redirect=OpenWrtViaTftp">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins … WrtViaTftp</a> (specifically section 1.3).&nbsp; The key is that there is basically a very small window of time that tftp will succeed without a timeout (what I did was to plug in the power supply of the router and then I immediately hit enter on the keyboard to start the tftp, if the tftp does not complete within 5 seconds of hitting enter then you were not quick enough, unplug and try again).&nbsp; If you watch for a successful ping then you will likely be to slow.&nbsp; I had a switch between my pc and my wrtsl54gs.&nbsp; I also set my pc to static 192.168.1.10 and default route to 192.168.1.1</p>									</div>
