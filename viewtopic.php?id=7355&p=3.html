What I would like to know is: am I able to somehow run SABnzbd (that&#039;s a linux newsreader) on it and to send nzb download url&#039;s to it from outside. I read the device runs on linux so I figured this might work. The thing is I know nothing about linux or the WL 600g yet and I have no idea how it compares to the WL 500g. Could you please give me some directions to were to start reading/learning about these modifications.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve been playing around with the wl600g and have had limited success in getting new software running on it - I now have a torrent client (transmission) running on the router, but unfortunately it&#039;s not too stable and has a habit of crashing the entire router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>The wl600g doesn&#039;t seem to be binary compatible with the 500g series, so unfortunately the package repos for the 500g routers aren&#039;t able to run - I&#039;d love to be proved wrong on this, though.</p><p>To get the newsreader running on it, you&#039;ll definitely need to know your way around the linux build tools, and you&#039;ll need to get the newsreader to cross-compile to the mips chip that the router uses instead instead of using the normal build tools for your linux distribution.</p><p>To start with, make sure you can rebuild the kernel from source, as described in the posts above. If you can get that sorted, you&#039;ll be on your way. Then you&#039;ll need to rewrite (or create from scratch) the makefile for the newsreader so it uses the mips tools used to build the firmware image. </p><p>Once you&#039;ve done that and have managed to sort out all the errors, you&#039;ll have a binary which can either be packaged into the firmware and flashed, or ftp&#039;d to the harddisk and run from there, which is my preference.</p>									</div>

I did not want to screw <br />my box without knowing how to fix it (see above). And I only wanted to <br />share some data on LAN.</p><br /><p>&gt; * You used the EXT2 filesystem, why not EXT3? And wouldn&#039;t it be <br />&gt; possible to use the NTFS filesystem on it WITH WRITE abbility when <br />&gt; compiling your own firmware?</p><p>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea to use ext3 on a relatively small USB <br />flash memory. And I do not need journaling there.</p><br /><p>&gt; * How fast are you able to use the harddrive over your network <br />&gt; compared to a normal drive accessed through the network?</p><p>I did not run any benchkmark. It is slower then using the USB flash disk <br />locally. Data throughput is not my top priority.</p><br /><p>&gt; * Do you think it&#039;s possible to run a service like SABnzbd (which is <br />&gt; a linux newsreader) on it?</p><p>As far as I know SABnzdb is a bunch of Python scripts... Python is not <br />included in the firmware, so you would have to provide it yourself. <br />Maybe it&#039;s part of OpenWRT and you would be lucky with running it on <br />WL-600g. Of course, you can &quot;simply&quot; compile Python and run it from <br />memory stick...</p>									</div>

					<p>By the way, I now know for a fact (unless the hardware just doesnt support it) that it&#039;s possible to run this newsreader service on the 600g. A guy on another forum wrote this:</p><p>Problem compiling programs requiring libstdc++ </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Hi all,</p><p>I am currently trying to create my first ipkg package, one that would install the &quot;par2cmdline&quot; application (used by SABnzbd, a server based usenet downloader that I have running on my WL-500g). It is a C++ application and requires stdlibc++.</p><p>Now it&#039;s not very clear to me how to compile applications using libstdc++ for the WL-500g. In the forum there are a number of threads from different dates saying different things. I know hwoever that other packages that work depend on it (e.g. nmap) so there should be a way... Now I managed to get the application compiled using the cross-compile environment as explained on the Unslung homepage (had to include a &quot;make libstdc++-staging&quot; in the Makefile) and it packages correctly, it installs OK on my WL-500g but when I run it I get the message &quot;cannot find libstdc++.so.5&quot; (I have both the libstdc++ wrapper package and uclibc package installed). Could someone provide me with a short overview on the best way to compile programs requiring libstdc++ based on the current Unslung state?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Peter.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>are there any news regarding the&nbsp; and OpenWRT?</p><p>I bought an Asus WL-WL600g wireless ADSL2+ router a couple of days ago, and now I am a bit unhappy with the original firmware. First I thought that even DynDNS is not supported, but it seems that I just missed to find it on the configuration website. But when choosing this product I hoped that it would be supported by OpenWRT soon, because I like the idea of having a fully configurable router very much.</p><p>So, has anyone had success installing OpenWRT on this device recently, with support for ADSL2+ and WiFi of course? The device is still listed as &quot;untested&quot; on the OpenWRT website. How could I help you to get it working? The GPL source code of the router was on a CDROM (also an older version is on the Asus website), therefore it should be possible to include the needed stuff in OpenWRT. I don&#039;t know anything about the binary module stuff though. Maybe I can help you with my programming skill, if the tasks are not to complex.</p><p>Best regards,<br /> Eike</p>									</div>

					<p>openwrt image is ready to flash (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/brcm63xx-2.6">https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/brcm63xx-2.6</a>). <br />only <strong>basic and most important detail </strong> is that openwrt cannot support propietary <em>binary</em> drivers for </p><p><span class="bbu">network drivers for the on-boards DSL, Ethernet and USB</span></p><p>So one possibility is to use ASUS tarball and crosscompile programs you need. Main problem is that i&#039;ve got problems <br />runing RW filesystem overlay with mini_fo.ko, but USB storage works well as storage. </p><p>To use openwrt enviroment with those stupid binary drivers, new target must be created with same kernel and gcc<br />(Linux version 2.6.8.1 (root@localhost) (gcc version 3.4.2) #3 Wed Aug 22 21:25:06 CEST 2007)<br />because current target works with latest (2.6.22.4). But then there will be problem configuring ASUS propietary stuff</p><p>ASUS GPL tarball does not have libstdc++ so it must be ported prior porting ctorrent or rtorrent.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi <br />I flashed the device with my own custom build. &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately the build broke my device. Now i have a problem with puting oryginal firmware (or any other firmware) on the device. After the device starts the power led is red and the device dosent respond (i have ping but the tftp server always returns a timeout error when i try to flash it). I&#039;v tried to hold the reset button while turning the power on but the device behaves the same.<br />I&#039;v been trying to find a solution for this problem for nearly two days so any suggestions are welcome.</p>									</div>
