					<p>I can&#039;t seem to find ebtables. I find several tutorials showing how to just type &#039;ipkg update; ipkg install ebtables&#039; but whenever I do opkg update then opkg list, ebtables is not listed among the 1439 available packages.</p><p>And of course &quot;opkg install ebtables&quot; just yeilds&nbsp; the line &quot; * Cannot find package ebtables.&quot;</p><p>Am I doing something wrong?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-Jesse</p>									</div>

Pardon the engineer in me for a second (the one who always wants things to make sense :-)). A couple of years ago or so, I set up an old motorola router (WR850Gv3, 200Mhz) with whiterussian (0.9) and ran ebtables on it and it really worked great. I could get like 17mbit/sec through it - which is ample for what I needed.</p><p>I also run ebtables on a ~400Mhz x86 which handles all of our customer&nbsp; traffic, which often hovers around 30 mbit/second at peak usage, and it has no trouble that I&#039;ve noticed...</p><p>Also, couldn&#039;t the ebtables code for the kernel be a module so that it could be loaded if it was needed, but not loaded if it wasn&#039;t needed, thus not slowing things down?</p><p>ebtables is just such an amazingly powerful tool for those times when you need it - and whatever slowness it adds sure isn&#039;t so bad it makes it useless. Maybe you&#039;d need a bit faster hardware - but that&#039;s not hard to do!</p><p>If you happen to know of a technical discussion of the problem, I would be most grateful if you could direct me to it.
