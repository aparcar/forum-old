					<p>THIS BUILD IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED SEE <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50914">HERE</a> FOR MY LATEST BUILDS</p><p>I&#039;ve spent some time rolling my own builds of trunk for a while and after a lot of requests decided to share the build since a lot of people are normal and don&#039;t necessarily know what a compiler is... The WNDR3700 is a great router and I think everybody deserves to have a taste of OpenWrt. For this build I aim to include everything that makes sense for this type of router, and also to have a working default configuration for all services.</p><p>I recommend using the TFTP method to flash (basically hold reset button while turning on until power flashes green then TFTP the factory image, look in wiki for detailed instructions). From stock just flash the factory image through web.</p><p>Feature list:</p><p>- <strong>Luci</strong> web interface<br />- <strong>Default SSID</strong> OpenWrt on both 2.4GHz/5GHz (password is changeme) <br />- <strong>WPS</strong> and <strong>WiFi</strong> on/off buttons enabled<br />- <strong>Reset button</strong> enabled (default settings)<br />- <strong>EXT2/3/4</strong> file system support<br />- <strong>Block-mount</strong> (auto mount USB storage and extroot functionality)<br />- <strong>GPT disk support</strong><br />- <strong>HD-idle</strong> (spins down USB disk after inactivity)<br />- <strong>Dynamic DNS</strong><br />- <strong>SFTP/FTP/NFS/SMB/AFP</strong> network filesystems<br />- <strong>NFS/SMB/FTP/AFP</strong> shares /mnt/sda1 and maps everyone to root with R/W access (WARNING, ANYONE ON THE LOCAL NETWORK CAN READ/WRITE TO YOUR USB STORAGE)<br />- <strong>Avahi/Bonjour</strong> service discovery (nice if you have a Mac or Linux system)<br />- <strong>Time Machine support</strong><br />- <strong>UPNP/NAT-PMP</strong> port forwarding<br />- <strong>MiniDLNA</strong> (latest CVS) for streaming media<br />- <strong>minissdpd</strong> allows for both miniupnpd and minidlna to run at the same tim<br />- <strong>PPTP VPN</strong> (issues IP&#039;s in same range as LAN), all you need is a user in /etc/ppp/chap-secrets like &quot;user * password *&quot;<br />- <strong>IPv6</strong> supported (6in4, 6to4, aiccu, radvd)<br />- <strong>QoS</strong> (scripts and luci app)<br />- <strong>Jumbo frame</strong> passthrough support<br />- <strong>Useful tools</strong> (at daemon, ip, dtach)<br />- <strong>Config included</strong> (openwrt in /etc/openwrt-config.gz and kernel in /proc/config.gz)</p><p>Extra alternate build features:</p><p>- <strong>Removed MiniDLNA/PPTP</strong><br />- <strong>L2TP/IPSec VPN</strong> (issues IP&#039;s in same range as LAN), all you need is a user in /etc/ppp/chap-secrets like &quot;user * password *&quot; and a PSK in /etc/racoon/psk.txt.<br />- <strong>NZBget</strong> (latest SVN) usenet downloader, postprocessing script included<br />- <strong>Transmission daemon</strong> torrent downloader<br />- <strong>vnStat</strong> traffic monitor<br />- <strong>tcpdump</strong> traffic inspector</p><p>If you have USB storage, format the first partition as ext2/3/4 and it will automatically be mounted when connected. To mount on boot edit /etc/config/fstab.</p><p>You can find the build here:</p><p><a href="http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/archive/">http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/archive/</a></p><p>OpenWrt changelog:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/log/trunk">https://dev.openwrt.org/log/trunk</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/log/packages">https://dev.openwrt.org/log/packages</a><br /><a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/log/luci/trunk">http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/log/luci/trunk</a></p><p>Useful links:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arokh</strong> on 7 Jul 2014, 09:14)</p>

					<p>Thanks you for your great work.<br />I have Netgear WNDR3700 with stock 1.0.4.68 firmware. What is the procedure:<br />1. From stock flash the factory image through web - this firmware: openwrt-wndr3700-r24556-squashfs-factory.img<br />2. Then using the TFTP method flash with this firmware: openwrt-wndr3700-r24556-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin. Right ? It&#039;s need to be applied both firmware ?<br />The link to <strong>openwrt-wndr3700-r24556-squashfs.config</strong> not working.

					<p>This build seems to have some performance issues, I&#039;m downgrading kernel and uClibc to trunk default. That way you can install binaries and kernel modules from the repo&#039;s without trouble also. New build coming up as soon as it finishes compiling <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>EDIT: All you need to flash from stock is the -factory.img file.

I installed it fine anyway. Just trying out some stuff at the moment, I have A LOT OF OPTIONS now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Okee, another questions:<br />How can I use channels which are not legal in my country(Netherlands)? I have a HP notebook from the US which doesn&#039;t see 2.4GHz frequencies on channel 11 and higher, with a Sitecom dual-band wireless adapter, which doesn&#039;t see any 5GHz frequencies with a higher channel than 48. And how does HT mode work?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>japperrrr</strong> on 15 Dec 2010, 19:15)</p>

					<p>My device just crashed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I wanted to know how many wireless networks I could create on the 2.4GHz band, so I made Network, Network1, Network2 and Network3(not exactly sure how it went but it was something like this). When I created Network4 I lost connection with the router and couldn&#039;t connect anymore. I can still see Network, Network2 and Network3, but they all return an error message. I also tried to connect with a cable but that doesn&#039;t work either. It just shows &#039;Unidentified network&#039;. How can I reset my router or fix it so that I can use it again?</p><p>Uhm, I&#039;m just screwed now aren&#039;t I?</p><p>Fixed it already, I reset my device using recovery mode <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>japperrrr</strong> on 15 Dec 2010, 21:24)</p>
