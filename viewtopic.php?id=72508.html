					<p>I am looking at building an image for the Netgear 6100d to replace the stock sprint firmware, I was curious though if OpenWrt was able to handle integrated sim card readers?</p><p>I am quite a noob at OpenWrt so all help is appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t confuse the 6100d LTE modem / router with the R6100 (regular router, no modem, supported) or the D6100 (router / DSL modem, unsupported).&nbsp; It appears all three are completely different hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>I understand, that is why I am building my own custom version following the guide on the site. Would OpenWrt support the hardware of the sim card reader present in the 6100d?</p>									</div>

					<p>I would expect the modem section is a separate module with its own proprietary firmware.&nbsp; That is what links to the SIM card and you won&#039;t be changing that.</p><p>Have you looked inside the case?&nbsp; Wikidevi doesn&#039;t have any details on the 6100d.</p>									</div>
