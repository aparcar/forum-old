					<p>Hi,</p><p>I owned an ASUS WL-500 premium router (V1).<br />My &quot;project&quot; is to connect a webcam and an usb-stick to the ports and</p><p>1) let the router take a snapshot at high resolution (maybe 1600x1200 (2mp), but 1280x1024 will do the job, too) every XX minutes and stores the image (jpg?) to the stick<br />2) use a lowres version of that picture to provide a traditional (password protected) webcam-page to the internet</p><p>the connection from the WL-500 to the internet must initiated by wlan (WPA encrypted possible?) to an access-point or a second WL-500 (this one can take another picture from another view as a second step)</p><p>My questions:<br />- is this possible?<br />- which firmware (e.g. asus original, openwrt, dd-wrt, oleg, others) would be the best choice for these requirements (I am not aware of cmdline and vi editing, but if there is a fast solution... ;-) ?<br />- which (actually in stores, not that expensive plz) webcam will work and fulfill my needs (high resolution that works with the router)?</p><p>thank you for your attention and your answers in advance</p><p>regards,<br />bit</p>									</div>

					<p>Everything should work, you want a 1.3 megapixel webcam. You can look up webcams supported by Linux according to drivers on google. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>@kupesoft: thank you for your answer. Is there a problem with high resolution support in linux/openwrt or is 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 possible?</p><p>@all: I put the MSI Starcam racer (1.3MP) and the Logitech Quickcam pro 9000 (2MP) into choice, does anyone have any experiences whith these devices and openWRT?</p><p>thanks in advance,<br />bit</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>Proposed hardware:<br />Buy a Logitech Quickcam Sphere AF or a Quickcam Pro 9000. Both support up to 1600x1200 pixel (in YUYV mode, 5 fps).</p><p>Install the most recent version of MJPG-streamer:<br />* Apply and update it to get the revision &gt;= 78 (see tickets, I submitted a patch a while ago for revision 73)<br />* start MJPG-streamer from one of the init-scripts.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mjpg-streamer -b --input &quot;input_uvc.so --yuv --device /dev/video0 --resolution 1600x1200 --fps 5&quot; --output &quot;output_http.so -w /tmp/&quot; --output &quot;output_file.so --folder /tmp --delay $((XX*1000*60)) --size 1000&quot;</code></pre></div><p>One input plugin grabs the pictures from of the webcam. Two output plugins care for output, one is for the webserver, the other one for the file ringbuffer (or FiFo, first in, first out). In order not to damage your flash, I would recommend to start with &quot;/tmp&quot;. You can adjust this path to your flashdrive afterwards and adjust the ringbuffer size to the number of pictures you would like to keep.</p><p>The patch is listed here, update it to the most recent revision (just one number to edit):<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4347">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4347</a></p><p>This way there will be no low res version, but if you find a command line tool like imagemagik you can make the fileoutput plugin execute a command for each stored picture. The filename is passed as first parameter.</p><p>Viel Spass,<br />Tom</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tom</strong> on 21 Jan 2009, 22:39)</p>
