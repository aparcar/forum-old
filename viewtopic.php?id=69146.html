					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am working on a command line script to automate certain actions on radio1 (a second wifi adapter, radio0 provides the connection/AP to the router).</p><p>When using Luci to make changes to radio1 and doing Save &amp; Apply, it never drops connection on radio0 (the radio I am connected with to access the router/luci).</p><p>When I use UCI and/or edit /etc/config/wireless directly (only modifying radio1), when I issue &quot;wifi&quot; to reload the settings it essentially restarts all of the wireless services which causes me to be disconnected from the router and requires reconnecting. </p><p>I tried looking in the source of Luci but it seems like it also issues the &quot;wifi&quot; command, so I&#039;m not sure if there is a method I&#039;m overlooking to apply changes to radio1 only via UCI without causing the entire wireless stack to be reloaded (specifically radio0).</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe &quot;uci commit&quot;?</p><p>You could use iw to poke settings directly into the radio1 driver, but if you&#039;re doing anything involving encryption it needs to be coordinated with hostapd / wpa_supplicant.&nbsp; The uci system generates a file in /var/run (which is a RAM disk) for each encrypted interface then launches an instance of wpa_supplicant to run it.&nbsp; You could try to modify those files then restart the supplicant processes.</p>									</div>
