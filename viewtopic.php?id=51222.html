					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I am currently running OpenWRT on my TP-link TL-WR1043ND V2,</p><p>I would like to reach the following: <br />OpenWRT serves as Accesspoint and switch:<br />&nbsp; - SSID public is bridged to VLAN 3<br />&nbsp; -SSID Private is bridged to VLAN 4, and the LAN ports.<br />There&#039;s a trunk set up via either WAN or LAN-1 port, to another router<br />this router also does DHCP, DNS, Routing, Firewalling(Basic router functions), for both VLANs.</p><p>from what I understood,<br />I need to create 2 SSIDs, and bridge them to VLAN&#039;s Eth0.3 and Eth0.4<br />When I try to add the LAN-ports to VLAN 4, I instantly lose access to the router</p><p>please advice..<br />I could net set up trunking: the WAN interface never came up.<br />What I did so far, in different variations(can&#039;t show my config files, I just had to do my 4th factory reset).<br />On the other router I&#039;ve set up both VLAN 3 and 4, with DHCP+DNS access, routes to the internet, and everything I need.<br />then, on OpenWRT, i made my wireless networks<br />I made the VLAN&#039;s,<br />I made the bridges between VLAN and SSID<br />how do I continue from here??</p><p>I cannot find any WORKING, well-documented example on how to use a second router..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>frankbarmentlo</strong> on 21 Jun 2014, 18:05)</p>
