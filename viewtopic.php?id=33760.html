					<p>Hey, new here. Not sure if this is the right section for this or not.</p><p>I&#039;m hoping to someday build my own home router using a Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX and a AMD Opteron. But to my current knowledge OpenWRT doesn&#039;t have pre-existing builds for the Opteron so I would have to compile it myself (Which I don&#039;t know how to do); in addition I&#039;m also a Windows junkie and had a bit of trouble switching to Linux in the past. So I was wondering what would be the best way to go about doing this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Where to start... that&#039;s always a difficult question. As you said yourself you&#039;re more a windows guy, you&#039;ll find the learning curve to be quite steep. Only advice i can give you is read read and read. Try the setup a build environment for OpenWRT by installing Ubuntu on a virtual machine. Use the wiki and google and don&#039;t give up.</p><p>As for the opteron part, as it is a x86 architecture, x86 pre-built images should probably work.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>
