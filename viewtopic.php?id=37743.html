					<p>Hi! i&#039;m new in OpenWrt! I have to do a project for my school. I have to send packages or files from my router to a pc (for example). I have read about an experiment that consisted in sending a series of packets of about 500KB every 0.4 seconds through a series of paths more or less &quot;hard&quot;, starting from two nodes of the network and measuring lost packets (&quot;packet loss&quot;). I have to do the same but I don&#039;t know how to do it. Is there anyone that can help me? thanks</p>									</div>
