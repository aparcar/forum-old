					<p>I have some other suggestions:</p><p>+ I think that the default access after just installing should be ssh instead of telnet, or should have them both by default (ssh and telnet).&nbsp; Off course, this could lead to a question: OpenSSH or Dropbear by default.</p><p>If somebody doesn&#039;t like to have ssh installed by default, maybe you can remove the ssh from the default via a parameter to make.</p><p>+ For upgrade.&nbsp; Well, due to the size of the distro, and the configs (not too much of them), I don&#039;t think this can be a terrible problem, but: shouldn&#039;t there be a way for having the whole system as jffs2?, and have just one &quot;partition&quot; for the kernel (maybe fixed size, say: 1.4Mb).&nbsp; This way, the whole system could be made of packages, and be easier the upgrades.&nbsp; Well, the drawback could be the great advantage that squashfs gives: compressed files (does jffs2 support such a thing?).&nbsp; I think this could be of less importance on the wrt54gs (due to the extra flash).</p><p>Any comments are wellcome,</p><p>Sincerelly,</p><p>Ildefonso.</p>									</div>

					<p>that is what I am after in another thread.</p><p>I wish that all the .mk files(except a few real essentials like busybox, uclibc) has an option to &quot;get into rootfs&quot; in addition to ipkg.</p><p>This way, anyone can control it from the master Makefile and pick what they think is &quot;essential packages&quot; that will go into squashfs rootfs.&nbsp; So we can preserve the spirit of openwrt, minimalist but give us some flexibility on what should be in this &quot;minimal set&quot;.</p><p>Another thing I don&#039;t know is I have done a &quot;ldd busybox&quot; under the hosting system(i386) which said busybox built for openwrt is not a dynamic executable. Since we need to put uclibc there anyway, can all the package build as dynamic instead of static to save some space. I could be wrong though as I don&#039;t know too much about these cross compiling thing and not sure if &quot;ldd&quot; is valid in this case.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I don&#039;t know either.&nbsp; In Agenda, people compiled everything statically in order to save RAM, and also made the processor run code directly from the flash (a feature of the NEC processor used).</p><p>I&#039;m not sure, I think all of these should be dynamic, but I&#039;m not sure if busybox is compiled statically by default (due that it is most oftem used to recovery and installation disks).</p>									</div>
