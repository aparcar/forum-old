					<p>I have a configured my network such that an OpenWRT router runs at 192.168.2.1. I want to be able to switch between two internet connections:</p><p>- A TL-WA5210G at 192.168.2.254 runs in client router mode connected to another wifi network<br />- A (E367) 3G modem attached to the openwrt router.</p><p>My router (MR3020) has a switch for changing between 3G and AP, and I&#039;ve managed to call a script when it changes position.</p><p>If my clients set their gateway as 192.168.2.1 they get the 3G modem connection, if they set to 192.168.2.254 they get the wifi internet connection - and both work.</p><p>Is there a way to have the default gateway for clients always set as 192.168.2.1, but somehow forward to 192.168.2.254 when not using the 3G modem? I can change the gateway provided by the DHCP server, but that requires clients to renew their IP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trsaunders</strong> on 26 Aug 2014, 03:09)</p>

					<p>create some route rule on MR3020. For example 10.0.0.0/24 network located behind 192.168.2.254. So all traffic to 10.0.0.x goes throw TL-WA5210G and all other throw 3G default route.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the tip but I&#039;m not sure how that would achieve what I want - how can I dynamically change all traffic to go through 10.0.0.x? My networking knowledge is not great!</p><p>I think the ideal solution would be to have NAT running on the MR3020 (with OpenWRT) and to have two possible WAN interfaces defined:<br />- TL-WA5210G<br />- E367 3G modem</p><p>But I&#039;m struggling to get the first option setup. The TL-WA5210G has a static IP (192.168.2.254). My current network config is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;
        option ifname &#039;lo&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;

config interface &#039;lan&#039;

        option gateway &#039;192.168.2.254&#039;
        option dns &#039;8.8.8.8&#039;</code></pre></div><p>and wireless:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

There&#039;s only one network port on the MR3020 and that&#039;s being used to connect directly to the WA5210G.</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>
