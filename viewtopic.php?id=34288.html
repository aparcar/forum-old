					<p>I had TP-LINK WR1043ND setup just the way I like it, and it was performing just great.</p><p>Then two days ago I got a brilliant idea, why not move my iphone charger to other my work room and I&#039;ll charge iphone when in living room from WR1043ND USB port. Cool idea, right? Well it worked for two days.</p><p>Now my WR1043ND is bricked with all LED lights flashing continuously, my guess is that somehow iphone charging was cause of this, and I can blame only myself.</p><p>I&#039;ll try to fix it and report back how I&#039;m doing. I&#039;ll first try just to reflash it via serial cable, if that doesn&#039;t help I&#039;m open to suggestions.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Valent.</p>									</div>
