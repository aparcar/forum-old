					<p>I had an issue once already and this is my second time encountering it. The issue is wifi breaks, and the WAN breaks. LAN still works, just not WLAN.</p><p>I got a log from logging in with another wifi router I have in my home and the results are at <a href="http://p.gecko.im/4b">http://p.gecko.im/4b</a> which also contains the revision and version of OpenWRT I&#039;m using on this router.</p><p>Is this a known issue to have the whole router crash after about a week? What can I do next time it happens to get better information for people here? Should I upgrade to a later version? I know this is a nightly.</p>									</div>

					<p>I ran the stock Linksys image for a few weeks, and wifi locked up on it about every 7 to 12 days. At least with Openwrt you have the ability to set up a cron job and just reboot the router once a week at the time of your choosing.</p><p>I&#039;m just thinking about buying a different brand router, and get off of this crappy Marvel hardware found in the 1900ac.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds like my situation. My WRT1900 is quite brickable, whereas my Buffalos do brick, but reviving them is easy. I need a pro to revive my 1900, ha.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>grmrgecko wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>WRT1900AC is now setup as a bridge for my AC devices. the WZR-600DHP (a router I had before this one) is now setup as the main with a freshly installed OpenWRT.
