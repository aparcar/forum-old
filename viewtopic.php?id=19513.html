					<p>Hello everybody.This is my first post in this forum and forgive me for any mistakes.<br />Straight now to the point.A friend of mine gave to me a Linksys WAG200G EU modem/router/gateway and it said to me that is dead.<br />The first thing i noticed was that the main (I think) chipset was overheating so I putted an aluminium heatsink and a small cooler and i think It&#039;s better now .I just mentioning this about the overheating of the chipset cause I don&#039;t know if it envolving with the problems i have.<br />Now the main part.The router when i type in mozilla the ip adress takes me to it&#039;s web interface but i&#039;ve tried any know combination of username and passwords but nothing.The next step was to reset it but also nothing!!I&#039;ve contacted linksys support and told me about the 30-30-30 procedure and all the other known procedures (i was speaking to him almost an hour) but also nothing.From cmd i pinged it and it&#039;s working ok!When i put the mains it seems to work ok.</p><p>Is my router bricked?<br />How can i reset it? or better shall i put a new firmaware to it?<br />Which way would i prefer? jtag?tftp?</p><p>Ive searched a lot over the internet and read a lot of topics and articles.</p><p>Please as i&#039;m an almost newbee in this any help would be appreciated!!!</p><p>Thanks in advance and greetings from Greece!!!</p>									</div>
