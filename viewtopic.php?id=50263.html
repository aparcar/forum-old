					<p>Hi to all the community. </p><p>I&#039;m with the purpose of developing a package not defined in the public repositories to be executed on my routers. Is written in C/C++ (the dependencies are Openvswitch and Click Modular Router). I have a Linksys WRT45g (backfire) and a TPLink1043nd (barrier breaker).</p><p>I have followed the toolchain steps <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a></p><p>But now, where I have to put my code? in which directories of the toolchain tree structure I have to put? or this is not the correct action?<br />The toolchain process made me to construct: /home/nameofuser/openwrt/openwrt and then here I have the following directories:</p><p>BSDmakefile, build_dir, config, Config.in, dl, docs, feeds, feeds.conf.default, include, LICENSE, Makefile, package, README, rules.mk,scripts, staging_dir, target, tmp, toolchain, tools</p><p>What is the next step? I have to do a Makefile? does the toolchain generate an .ipkg file? Before trying the toolchain option I tried with the SDK <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm47xx/</a> but I had no succes.</p><p>Sorry for my basic level of english/openwrt/linux.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>adrianux</strong> on 22 Apr 2014, 19:44)</p>

					<p>In that link, you will see there is a sub-section called <em>package</em>. That is the one you will need. However, I strongly recommend you peruse each subsection.</p>									</div>
