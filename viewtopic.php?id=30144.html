					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to setup some Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH devices with OpenWRT.</p><p>Until here all my attempts to setup OpenWRT failed.</p><p>Short Story:</p><p>After flashing, the device seems to reboot correctly: the red diag leg turn on, then the wireless led blinks and finally turn on permanently.</p><p>Once booted the device sits there like a brick: I can&#039;t telnet on 192.168.1.1 (it doesn&#039;t even respond to arp requests and setting up my arp cache manually doesn&#039;t help).</p><p>Long story:</p><p>I started from the original Buffalo&#039;s dd-wrt setup and used mtd to install 10.03.1-rc4 (squashfs). The device reboots like explained.</p><p>I re-flahsed it using tftp, same result. Then I tried 10.03 to end up with the same symptoms.</p><p>Then I flashed it back to the Buffalo&#039;s AirStation firmware successfully.</p><p>Finally, I tried 10.03.1-rc4 again (using tftp), and I&#039;m back to my starting point.</p><p>Each time I rebooted it and tried to connect to it with the &quot;Router&quot; switch in a different position (i.e on/off/auto). Also I tried the lan ports 1 and 4 each time.</p><p>Interestingly enough it seems that I can launch the failsafe mode: when the wireless led start to blink I press the &quot;AOSS&quot; button several time and the wireless led start to blinks very quickly. Unfortunately the failsafe mode doesn&#039;t change anything.</p><p>I can&#039;t understand what goes wrong or where I made a (stupid) mistake. Any advice will be appreciated. Maybe I can try the jffs2 image? (even though, I don&#039;t see what it cans change here).</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

I am talking about the ethernet switch chip on the device. See <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/9427">this ticket</a> for someone with a 300 working only with the 301 image. As long as you can tftp a new image through the bootloader, you shouldn&#039;t be able to break anything <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br /> i&#039;m having 2 buffalo g300nh routers. the first one was bought in India<br /> having the version number as b0 c0, the second one was bought in US having<br /> the version as A2 A0.</p><p> i have built the firmware from source (SVN Version 27291- built from<br /> scratch) with additional packages. i was able to upgrade the firmware<br /> using tftp on the router which was bought in India. however, the router<br /> which was bought in the US is not working after updating with g300nh<br /> firmware. the ethernet is defunct as i dont see any dhcp packet on lan/wan<br /> and the red light stays on.</p><p> Based on jow&#039;s input instead of g300nh firmware i used g301nh firmware on<br /> the US router. the ethernet started to work.</p><p> The only issue with g301 firmware is although the ethernet is working i<br /> dont see the green router icon flashing which is actually flashing in the<br /> router that was bought in India running g300 firmware.</p><p> Also, the red diag light is always On on the g301 firmware. i tried to<br /> change the status on the LED configuration, still no use.</p><p> Could you please let me know why the US router requires g301 firmware as<br /> opposed to g300 firmware. what is causing this issue.</p><p> Thanks,<br /> Aswin</p>									</div>
