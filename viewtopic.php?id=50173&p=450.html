Including error message and descriptions what I like to do / have.</p><p>I am not using openwrt the first time and went over to build my own due to the standard once don&#039;t work as I like it or causing problems. One of the important things for me is not to use the &quot;old&quot; kernel and driver since I had a lot of trouble with it regarding wifi and performance. <br />Before I got the wrt1900acs I had a Netgear R7000 but was forced to use dd-wrt due to wifi drivers not accepted in openwrt (no FOSS driver support). DD-wrt is full of unnecessary stuff and slow or even older in kernel and so on. After 3 month having trouble with it I purchased the 1900acs. </p><p>The snap shot image makes problems with the USB2/esata combo port. USB2 is not working with this image. I posted it here and after a while I also open a case to dev. Didn&#039;t got feedback yet or for sure there is something wrong with my case. How ever. I really like to build my own image with newer kernel and wifi driver, nfs, samba, minidlna, qos, astarisk13, sftp and openssh to backup my vps to local.</p><p>I used now three weeks, flashing by flashing. Always is something wrong with the images. So I need my own build I guess. I don&#039;t know what I am doing wrong...</p>									</div>
