					<p>Hello!<br />I bought this &quot;wifi repeater&quot; 2 years ago. I would like to mod it to use USB flash drives (in order to &quot;extend&quot; the memory).<br />This repeater is very very similar to WNR2000(v3?), and it has the &quot;AR7241&quot; CPU (I will upload some photos later).<br />I did the &quot;hardware&quot; part, soldering the USB connector to CPU like other usb mods (something like this: <a href="http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6154/usb740nv4png.jpg">http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6154/usb740nv4png.jpg</a>)<br />I checked all voltages with a multimeter, and 5v is ok! (I used a 7805 regulator from 12v source), so I think I need some software tricks to make it recognizable.<br />I successfully flashed it with an OpenWRT pre-built image for the WNR2000v3, and it works!<br />My question is: How can I add the USB support to this router? I configured my linux machine to build an OpenWRT image.<br />P.S: can I use an SD card to extend the memory? I would like to install Luci but the SPI flash memory is only 4MB...</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Alessio.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alex.d93</strong> on 4 Apr 2015, 07:04)</p>
