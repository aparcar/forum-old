					<p>I think you are mixing up two completely different things. For the SD card, your board usually has a SD card reader, which is detected automatically by the USB bus host. Now, whether the SD card reader itself can notify the system of card insertion and extraction is a whole another matter.</p><p>If the reader can notify the system of these events, then you&#039;ll need to figure out what device management method (hotplug, udev, or something else?) you are using. Once you&#039;ve figured that out, you&#039;ll need to find the correct script, rule or configuration file that is either called during the SD card insertion/extraction, or which can manage the commands that are executed when either of these events occur.</p><p>After finding these out, your last step is to just add the &quot;block mount&quot; and &quot;block umount&quot; commands to the queue of commands that are executed for the related events.</p>									</div>

					<p>When you have a SD card controlled through a SD to USB bridge chip, the chip often will not detect the hot-plugging of a new SD card.&nbsp; There is not much you can do about that.</p>									</div>
