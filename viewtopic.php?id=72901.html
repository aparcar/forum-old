					<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>I would like to use my GL-AR300M with OpenWrt [1] as a mobile travel router. My notebook connects to the router via wifi (master mode, SSID GL.iNet). The router itself connects to the internet via the hotel&#039;s wifi (routed client mode, SSID PFALZconnect-hotspot):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Generic 802.11bgn Wireless Controller (radio0):

SSID: GL.iNet
Mode: Master
Channel: 6 (2.437 GHz)
Bitrate: 130 Mbit/s
BSSID: E6:95:6E:42:A9:DE
Encryption: mixed WPA/WPA2 PSK (CCMP)

SSID: PFALZconnect-Hotspot
Mode: Client
Channel: 6 (2.437 GHz)
Bitrate: 117 Mbit/s
BSSID: 6C:FA:89:90:31:43
Encryption: None</code></pre></div><p>Basically, this setup works, but I have two problems with it:</p><ul><li><p>The router only connects to <strong>one</strong> specific AP (BSSID 6C:FA:89:90:31:43 in the example above). But I want it to connect to <strong>any</strong> AP with the same SSID (SSID PFALZconnect-Hotspot in the example).</p></li><li><p>I cannot connect to the router via wifi (master mode, SSID GL.iNet) as long as it is not connected to the hotel&#039;s wifi with client mode. This is bad for a travel router since I cannot configure the device without connected client wifi.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, what I want is simple: always have access to the router via wifi independent of the status of the client mode connection. For client mode I want it to use all APs with identical SSIDs. Is that possible? How?</p><p>Help would be very much appreciated!!</p><p>THX</p><p>[1] OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 r47065 / LuCI for-15.05 branch (git-17.136.58961-13aa5ff)</p>									</div>

					<p>The first one is easy: delete the BSSID specification (delete the line in /etc/config/wireless, or leave the box blank in LuCI) and it will connect to any AP with the matching SSID.</p><p>The second one is a limitation of using the same radio for two functions.&nbsp; While a STA interface is searching for its AP, the AP mode interfaces on the same radio go off the air.&nbsp; There are scripts such as Travelmate to work around this, by disabling the STA when signal from the AP is not present.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cool! Thanks a lot for your answer!</p><p>The first one is really easy. It seems to be enough to leave the BSSID box blank in LuCI. It seems to work quite well. So far, I did not figure out if roaming works, but I will test soon...</p><p>The second one was the perfect hint! I was not sure whether or not travelmate will work with OpenWrt since it says LEDE 17.01 on their website. I just tried and it seems to work! Perfect!</p><p>For further reference I wanted to post the link to the travelmate website but unfortunately, I am not allowed to... :-(</p><p>THX for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you look for a up-to-date version of a open source firmware use LEDE 17.01.04 from October 2017 instead for the outdated OpenWrt binary. You can update from OpenWrt to LEDE.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, thanks, I know. But I have a GL-AR300M router with NAND flash (ar71xx/nand target). So far I was not able to find&nbsp; LEDE 17.1 for the NAND flash of this router. I tried to compile the source from <a href="https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01">https://github.com/gl-inet/lede-17.01</a> myself, but so far without success. Can I find a working image for the NAND flash somewhere? Or is it better to wait until the two projects are merged again? Or maybe I should try to compile myself again? Hmmm....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tom7320</strong> on 3 Jan 2018, 21:43)</p>

					<p>While the stock GL.iNet 2.264 firmware is not on LEDE, I believe it has been KRACK patched and will address the lock out issue (No AP when STAtion is unavailable). It also has a Station Manager tool built in.&nbsp; &nbsp;There even is some advice in the forums as to how to deal with the Portal issues typical in many hotels and hot spots.&nbsp; </p><p>Travelmate is now at 1.01 (see LEDE forum) and is not kernel dependent, so should work on all versions of firmware.<br /><a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/travelmate-support-thread/5155/41">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/travel … ad/5155/41</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I managed to compile LEDE with NAND flash support and it - somehow - worked. Unfortunately I wasn&#039;t able to compile with LuCI and tun/tap kernel drivers (build process stopped with an error). But I&#039;m really looking forward for the merge and official NAND support on this platform... :-)</p>									</div>
