					<p>Hello fellow wirelles freedom activists:P</p><p>Ok i have a few questions about openwrt firewall cuz i dont completely understand it. So the thing is: i flashed my wrt54gl with openwrt, because i need that wpa_supplicant thingy for wired 801.x authentication for my dorm internet. I have managed to configure wpa_supplicant so now my router authenticates and receives all necesary adresses from dhcp. </p><p>However when i ran bittorrent and tested the connection it said that port XXXXX is closed. I tried to open ports following some forum examples i found. First i tried with &#039;rule&#039; option:</p><p>config &#039;rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;XXXXX&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</p><p>Well that didn&#039;t do the trick. I than tried several options and finally i got my bittorrent to confirm the port is open by using &#039;redirect&#039; option:</p><p>config &#039;redirect&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src_dport&#039; &#039;XXXXX&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_ip&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;192.168.1.185&#039;</p><p>So now port XXXXX appears to be open/forwarded to dest_ip. I allso run COD6 server on my second computer so i set another &#039;redirect&#039; option:</p><p>config &#039;redirect&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src_dport&#039; &#039;28970&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;udp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_ip&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;192.168.1.233&#039;</p><p>Now my server appears in alteriwnet server list, some peaple even connected to it and also i can connect to server to its internal ip, even if server isnt shown in my ingame server list, so i assume these ports are open/forwarded. Im a bit new to this port thingy so i would appreciate some explanation about these things:</p><p>Was my way of opening/forwarding ports the right way?<br />Why did i have to forward/redirect the traffic? Isnt just assigning &#039;rule&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039; for specific port enough?<br />And why do my other programs like browser or skype connect with no problem thou i havent open/forwarded ports (80 or ports skype uses)?<br />Is it possible to completely disable the firewall or open/forward all ports to all hosts on router?<br />What is the difference between opening and forwarding a port?<br />Will i have to forward ports to ip of any other computer i connect to router via wlan for example to use bittorrent and other services?</p><p>As i undestand it port forwarding is necessary because computers outside LAN cannt see computers inside LAN, they only send data to external ip, which is ip of wan on router. So when data comes to external ip to specific port a router must decide to which computer in LAN the data needs to be sent. So we have to tell router to forward data that is directed to specific port to the right computer in LAN (as i did with &#039;redirect&#039; option for bittorrent and cod6). That makes sense. But how come some services like browsing and skype run without the need to tell the router to which computer in LAN the traffic is send to?</p><p>Tanks for any enlightning explanations:)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>godina</strong> on 14 Apr 2011, 13:18)</p>

So if you were running a http server on your PC (not on router), you would add a <strong>redirect</strong> for TCP, port 80<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>godina wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Why did i have to forward/redirect the traffic? Isnt just assigning &#039;rule&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039; for specific port enough?</p></blockquote></div><p>As I said, rules allow the traffic to go through the firewall and into the router. It didn&#039;t know what to do with the traffic you allowed (rules have neither dest_ip nor dest_port, where could it go?) so it just kept dropping those packets.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>godina wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>And why do my other programs like browser or skype connect with no problem thou i havent open/forwarded ports (80 or ports skype uses)?</p></blockquote></div><p>Most likely because skype doesn&#039;t need open ports to function. You open ports when you want to <strong>grant a service</strong> to outside world. It&#039;s basics. Your browser is a client, it connects to servers. Skype is a client, it also connects to servers (unless you have ports open, then you can be a server). uTorrent works kinda like a service, because people want to download stuff from you and they ask your client if it has the data they need.<br />Basically open ports = people from the outside world can initiate connections - it&#039;s dangerous because apps can have bugs and bad people can use it against you - that&#039;s why incoming traffic is blocked by default<br />closed ports = they can&#039;t.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>godina wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Is it possible to completely disable the firewall or open/forward all ports to all hosts on router?</p></blockquote></div><p>What? How? How would it know what data should go to YOUR PC, and what to another PC? It&#039;s not the way Internet and LAN network work. There is something called DMZ (demilitarized zone) though. It allows one (only one) computer in your LAN to be fully visible to the Internet (no firewall at all, all ports open)<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>godina wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>What is the difference between opening and forwarding a port?</p></blockquote></div><p>As I said already: open=allow incoming traffic to the device where the port is open, on that particular port. forwarded=the device (gateway) redirects traffic on a given port to another device in LAN<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>godina wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Will i have to forward ports to ip of any other computer i connect to router via wlan for example to use bittorrent and other services?</p></blockquote></div><p>Yes. But you could just enable UPnP (package: miniupnpd), both skype and uTorrent are taking care of port forwardings using UPnP (forwarding automatically) so you won&#039;t have to worry about it ever again.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>godina wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>As i undestand it port forwarding is necessary because computers outside LAN cannt see computers inside LAN, they only send data to external ip, which is ip of wan on router.

But how come some services like browsing and skype run without the need to tell the router to which computer in LAN the traffic is send to?</p></blockquote></div><p>Because both browser and skype _initiate_ a connection from behind the router (LAN). Clients are not waiting for someone to connect TO them (unless as I said, skype has open ports, then it might act as a server). There are many articles about incoming and outgoing traffic, just google.</p><p>Packets that get sent consist of Ethernet header, IP header and TCP header. Ethernet header includes source and destination MAC addresses, IP header - source and destination IP, TCP-ports used. Therefore if a packet gets sent and it returns to your router, it analyzes those headers and knows exactly where the returning packet should go. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>godina wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Tanks for any enlightning explanations:)</p></blockquote></div><p>yw</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dark_skeleton</strong> on 24 Apr 2011, 16:24)</p>

					<p>Well that explained a lot of things. Now I see that it really all makes sense, I can&#039;t belive I study telecommunication technology and didnt know TCP/IP basics:P It&#039;s just we dont to much practice which is very important when learning this stuff...</p><p>Thanks again for your answer now I know something more:)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I did exactly the same thing - even tried the same configuration that godina mentioned here in his first post. With absolutely no luck.<br />I tired to open some ports through CLI, and then on LuCi - still no results. <br />Even enabled upnp and tried to configure following the basic guides on the wiki site - again no luck.<br />I am running transmission on the router, and it seems like it is able to open it&#039;s required port to itself through NAT...</p><p>Port opening on the stock firmware was a breeze, but for obvious reasons (need to run torrent 24/7) I am not willing to go back to the stock firmware. I want to host listen servers in KF and to do that I need to open a handful of ports.<br />I am running &#039;OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07&#039; on my 1043ND if that matters.</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>
