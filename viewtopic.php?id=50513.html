					<p>Hello,</p><p>This is my first post here.</p><p>Been using OpenWRT for a while now, I am loving it. Moved to a new piece of hardware I recently purchased (TL-720N, chinese version) - been working nicely on the latest trunk versions. (please note that before posting this I&#039;ve updated to latest trunk, and repeated my tests)</p><p>However, I&#039;ve run into an issue - I can&#039;t seem to use the USB port. I&#039;ve gone through the usb guides, and ensured all the essential modules are installed, however the USB port seems to have no power.</p><p>A lsusb shows the following:<br />Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub</p><p>and if I leave a device plugged into the USB port while I boot the unit - the power light on the thumbdrive blinks (very briefly) - and then goes back out. dmesg will typically show something along the lines of:<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.720000] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci-platform<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.920000] eth1: link up (1000Mbps/Full duplex)<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 7.320000] usb 1-1: device not accepting address 2, error -71</p><p>If I plug anything into it after the fact, the port remains dead (no power). I tried the same thumb-drive in a &#039;dumb&#039; wall-charger that just supplies 5v, and it lights up continuously (so it isnt going dim just because it isnt mounted or active).</p><p>In my google search for answers (before posting this) I came across an article for a different router (a Buffalo router I believe) - where it turned out that a certain GPIO pin had to be high in order for its USB port to be provided with power. Might that happen to be the case with this piece of hardware (TL-720N) as well? It would seem to make sense, what with the fact that the port (very very briefly) gets power at boot-up..</p><p>Any assistance appreciated!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FOSS_FTW</strong> on 19 May 2014, 21:58)</p>

					<p>As a bit of an update (and I suppose a somewhat shameless bump):</p><p>Looking at:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/ar71xx/files/arch/mips/ath79/mach-tl-wr720n-v3.c?rev=36456">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/t â€¦ ?rev=36456</a></p><p>This lists GPIO8 as the USB power.

Looking across the hardware definitions for other TP-Link units, most of them seem to use GPIO8 for USB power. However, a few don&#039;t (such as the MR3040 which uses 18).</p><p>Does anyone know if USB&#039;s been confirmed working on the 720n? I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s possible that its actually on a different pin.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of trying to flip a few random GPIOs to high outputs later tonight and see if USB power comes alive - perhaps GPIO 8 is not actually the USB power...</p><p>If anyone has successfully used USB-host on a 720n running trunk - let me know please, so I don&#039;t chase this red herring and risk blowing something up by flipping random GPIOs. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> (for that matter, I&#039;m new to this GPIO-on-routers business and learning as I go - is it typically dangerous to flip GPIOs randomly? As long as I avoid the two that are connected to the switches - I imagine everything else would either be floating, or protected by resistors?)</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you really *measured* that USB power goes down or are yo just guessing this from the thumb drive LED behaviour? Please measure this (multimeter) or test it with a pure USB-power consumer (USB fan, USB light, ...). Just to make sure.</p><p>Have you tried to reset the root hub via usbreset? I&#039;m not sure if this helps, but I&#039;m too having a problem with trunk + USB where resetting the hub helps (in my case it&#039;s not the root hub, but a hub that&#039;s attached to the root hub that needs to be resetted after booting).</p><p>Edit: Have you tried a different thumb drive?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 12 May 2014, 19:18)</p>

					<p>Valid point - I will take a multimeter to the port once I am back home later tonight so as to 100% confirm power&#039;s going dead. Plugging the thumb drive into a &#039;dumb charger&#039; satisfied my curiosity in the moment - but that&#039;ll be more definitive. I&#039;ll also grab the lsusb output.</p><br /><p>I did try different thumb drives as well (3 or 4 different models)- On the hub, as well as directly connected. I also tried a PL2303 serial adapter that I&#039;ve successfully used on my 703n running OpenWRT - it does the same thing as the thumb drive (as observed from dmesg - briefly enumerates then fails).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FOSS_FTW</strong> on 12 May 2014, 19:39)</p>

					<p>Ok - I plugged a cut-up cable into the port and metered it - it does not have 5v on it. I was sure I was seeing things - it seemed to be jumping between 0 and 0.2v - I suspected meter jitter or skin galvanics, etc - but I couldnt reproduce it after I saw it the first time. I plugged the cable into a known-good port on another device and got the expected 5v, after which I tested the port on the 720n again, and got 0v still.</p><p>Here is the output of the lsusb -v -s 001:001:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

					<p>Just to make sure: You measured 0...0,2V directly on the router, not on the external USB hub? Also 0...0,2V when booting?

					<p>Interesting result:</p><p>I hooked the test cable up with a set of clip leads (so I didnt have to hold the meter probes on). I restarted the unit - and observed the fluctuating voltage again on the host port, around a couple volts.</p><p>I decided to try a different USB power source (the one powering the 720n) - plugged it into a different machine. Voltage was still fluctuating, but higher, around ~4.0 volts.</p><p>So I grabbed a higher current USB supply (110v adapter), and this time it stayed steady at ~4.8. Now the USB port also works correctly, the thumb drive powers up, and enumerates!</p><br /><p>I didn&#039;t think the unit negotiated upstream power, it was just a dumb leech of sorts - not the result I expected. And if upstream power was fluctuating that badly, I don&#039;t imagine the unit would have continued running at all. In any event - problem solved. Thanks for the help, and I hope this information can help someone else in the future - the 720n doesn&#039;t seem to power downstream devices properly when powered off of (some?) PC USB ports. (my 703n didn&#039;t have this issue)</p>									</div>
