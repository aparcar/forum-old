					<p>How much business do you guys think he does? Is there a total forum members display at Sveasoft? I understand how he could be making so much money, when I heard of the WRT I only heard of Sveasoft. I learned about everybody else after a long while of looking into it. I think a lot of people go straight to Sveasoft and don&#039;t mind paying the 20$ because&nbsp; they don&#039;t know they can get something like HyperWRT for nothing. I think the best thing to do is promote you firmwares more (although less so for OpenWRT because it&#039;s not a good introduction to it) and then he&#039;ll have fewer bites.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well next time you log onto the forums at SveaSoft, there&#039;s a number for registered subscribers. I don&#039;t know whether that number is active paying accounts or not, but last time I looked at it a year ago, multiplying it by $20 made him a millionaire.&nbsp; However this is hardly a concern to me. I don&#039;t mind greed.&nbsp; I do mind a lot what he is doing with hiding his source, after having willingly based it on GPL.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes his customer service and support skills are on a scale of 1 to 10..... about a -5.&nbsp; As you&#039;ve witnessed, he has a stunningly keen interest for searching other websites, remembering usernames of his subscribers and cross-referencing those against any possibly negative comments made about him. Unless you have consistently a brown-nose on all his searching, you are in the long list of suspected enemy agents.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing his list of trusted friends and fools is pretty short these days.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 16 Mar 2006, 19:35)</p>

I would join their team full-time for half that money (per person) but it wasn&#039;t enough for sveasoft so they often pointed out that it is a &quot;part-time&quot; or &quot;spare-time&quot; job for (at least some of) them...</p><p>I am still willing to pay similar ammount of money, but unfortunately, there are so many different versions of third-party firmware I can&#039;t decide which one to choose.

Imagine a web page with lot&#039;s of questions like &quot;what hardware do you have&quot; &quot;do you need pppoe&quot; &quot;do you need vpn&quot; &quot;do you need ipv6&quot; and so on ... and when you finish - voila - there is firmware customized just for you.

					<p>I overlooked the LinksysInfo story has the earlier version. So now you&#039;ll know how he feels about the GPL:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>SveaSoft wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The GPL itself is an &quot;all or nothing&quot; license based on the economic and political theories of Karl Marx. It claims it can subsume any other license if a single line of &quot;GPL&quot; licensed source code is used anywhere in the source files. Should this occur, all source code files become magically GPL licensed in their entirety. Naturally this claim by the GPL has never been tested in court and the GPL folks have adroitly avoided any and all court cases that might lead to a thorough legal review of the GPL license terms.</p><p>The Broadcom source code used in parts of our firmware and many other firmware distributions contains this clause specifically forbidding any relicensing of Broadcom copyright source code under the GPL.</p><p>Quote: The license and distribution terms for any publicly available version or derivative of this code cannot be changed. i.e. this code cannot simply be copied and put under another distribution license [including the GNU Public License.]</p><p>Projects like OpenWRT have &quot;re-licensed&quot; large portions of Broadcom copyright source code (and Sveasoft copyright source code) as GPL licensed source code. Since the above license terms specifically and clearly forbid this, this means the entire distribution&#039;s copyright and license terms are in doubt. Since the GPL is &quot;all or nothing&quot;, according to the terms of the GPL none of OpenWRT is covered by the GPL license anymore. Quite a catch-22.</p><p>Hopefully a US court will decide the validity and legal reach of the GPL sometime soon (GNU is a US-based organization).</p></blockquote></div><p>From the editorial here:<br/><a href="http://www.linksysinfo.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=497&amp;mode=nested&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0">http://www.linksysinfo.org/modules.php? … mp;thold=0</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 17 Mar 2006, 02:54)</p>

					<p>Yep.</p><p>James is unable to reconcile that he willingly chose GPL-based code, so he&#039;d rather it just &quot;went away&quot; so it would stop annoying him.&nbsp; Rather like users. James likes them best when they give him money, take what he gives them, and don&#039;t complain about anything. If you complain you must be a Commie.</p><p>Anyhow, I believe the original point was the possibility that he is continuing to rip off the work of GPL projects and include it in his firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp;If true, just handing out source might be out of the frying pan and into the fire. Likely he&#039;ll have plenty of opportunity during this time to cover his tracks, removing or replacing the allegedly offending code.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yep, quite a number of people have an axe to grind with James Ewings.&nbsp; Reasons vary, some petty, some not so petty.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally I watched the guy turn a fun little firmware project into an increasingly intolerant place. It seemed like as success mounted, his &quot;Captain Queeg&quot; character manifested itself more and more. What was once fun became more and more about control over the code. Code that he had not originated mind you, so control over it seemed a slippery problem.&nbsp; How do you claim control over territory that is not your own to start with?&nbsp; His solution for it was to sell himself as a service organization.&nbsp; But his customer service skillset is quite poor.&nbsp; And the only other solution in his toolbox which is control of the code is increasingly what he turns to.</p><p>I don&#039;t think anyone would notice his diminishing project at this point, all the other projects that grew up afterward have surpassed it and accelerating.&nbsp; Do you think James Ewings inspires developers to contribute to his project? No he scares them all off.&nbsp; No the big problem is he&#039;s grasping at anything and like a drowning man he&#039;s not too particular about what he does to stay alive.&nbsp; It&#039;s all kinda sad really.&nbsp; If he weren&#039;t such a big butthead about the whole thing I&#039;d feel sorry for him.&nbsp; Most people would apologize if they done wrong, or try to find some way to make amends and make things right. That&#039;s also good business I think. But he doesn&#039;t do that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 17 Mar 2006, 07:42)</p>
