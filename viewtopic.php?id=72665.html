					<p>I want to connect 2 routers without cables... the main router has configurations (mac restrictions, dhcp, QOS rules), and the second router should use the restrictions from the main router.</p><br /><p>I found the solution here.... I tried this document for dumbAP and it works as expected.<br />wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</p><p>The problem is that it needs to be wired.... i want to do the same dumbAP in wireless mode.</p><p>Any guide please?</p>									</div>

					<p>I just went through a similar situation.&nbsp; I have a main router with several switch&#039;s that have to be connected.&nbsp; So I use a pair of AP&#039;s.&nbsp; I have (3 WDS enabled devices).&nbsp; So I hooked one to my main router as the WDS AP and the other 2 are WDC clients.&nbsp; This is all default config.&nbsp; All I did was setup a wireless network on the main and then connect the other 2 two it.&nbsp; I am done.&nbsp; I know I can do more but, it is doing what I need to.&nbsp; </p><p>BTW I have $24 in three AP&#039;s.&nbsp; That&#039;s not a bad deal.</p><p>The only thing I need is reporting, and a central console.&nbsp; Having to manage them independently is a pain.&nbsp; But really not having to pay the huge management, &amp; license fee&#039;s is the big pay off.&nbsp; </p><p>Just off the subject why two routers?<br />RC</p>									</div>
