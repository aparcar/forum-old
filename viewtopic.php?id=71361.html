					<p>I&#039;m trying to configure rtorrent on GL.iNet GL-MT300A (manufacturer stock firmware). After futzing with opkg a bit, I got all 3 relevant packages (rtorrent, rtorrent-rpc, and luci-app-rtorrent). Then I proceeded to follow issue 5 on luci-app-rtorrent github. Among other things, it said to check that rtorrent is using port 5000 with</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>netstat -pantu | grep 5000</code></pre></div><p>When leaving rtorrent config with the default value (port 5000) netstat returns</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tcp 0 0 :::5000  :::*    LISTEN 1951/miniupnpd</code></pre></div><p>Whereas, if I change rtorrent port to 5001 I get</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:5001 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 8330/rtorrent
tcp 0  0 :::5000   :::*   LISTEN  1951/miniupnpd</code></pre></div><p>I googled around a bit, seems 5000 is requested occasionally by winxp systems. Because there are xp systems on the network I am on right now, this makes some sense. I will test more when I get home. But, now I would like to know, is there some way to carve out ports from upnp? For instance, can I set option ext_ports in /etc/config/upnpd to something like &#039;0-3,5-6&#039;?</p><p>This is somewhat academic, btw - I would not cry too much if I had to turn off upnp altogether - but, still, curious</p>									</div>
