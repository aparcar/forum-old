					<p>I need to calculate how much flash memory I need to install the packages I need. I went to the page that OpenWrt downloads from and found all the package sizes, but I don&#039;t know which packages are prerequisites for other packages.</p><p>For example, how do I find the dependencies for dnsmasq-full? When I tried to install it, OpenWrt just errored and told me I didn&#039;t have enough space. To know how much flash memory I need in the new router I&#039;m buying, I have to know all the dependent packages so I can calculate the total.</p><p>Please help</p>									</div>

					<p>I do not think they are readily available, but the problem is easy to solve if you are buying a new router.&nbsp; Just go for 16mb flash or something with a card in it. You can probably get by with 8, but why?</p><p>See the new ToH and sort by the flash column.&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_supported">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_e … _supported</a>&nbsp; As of CC many 4mb devices are no longer supported off the shelf.&nbsp; If you roll your own you may be able to get there.&nbsp; I have an 8mb device and with a few adds (USB, VPN) still have about 30% free.</p><p>This sort is Supported and Available items.&nbsp; Be careful, the table is not fully updated so there may be more Available products than in this list.&nbsp; Just clear the filters to left.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_supported?dataflt">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_e … ed?dataflt</a>[Availability*~]=Available</p>									</div>
