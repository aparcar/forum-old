					<p>Unless you want to script the IP update with v4, looks like dns-o-matic is the easiest option.</p><p>You&#039;ll need to set up dns-o-matic account for cloudflare support and your router for dns-o-matic support. </p><p>It seems to be trivial with minor googling.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m interested in rewriting &quot;update_cloudflare_com.sh&quot; as part of &quot;ddns-scripts&quot;.<br />I personally have no account at cloudflare so I&#039;m looking for users who like to help me during development, testing the new script before publishing.<br />Have a look into /usr/lib/ddns/update_cloudflare_com.sh for my direct mail and contact me directly.<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
