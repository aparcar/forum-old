					<p>I just installed OpenWRT 12.09 on my NSLU2.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am having troubles configuring IPv6.&nbsp; I referenced the following page:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6</a></p><p>12.09 is the latest, build on the website.&nbsp; So what in the world is this documenting referencing as &gt; 12.09?</p><p>In any case there does not appear to be an ipv6-support package, so this document must be referencing things that are not yet available...</p><p>So I go to:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6</a></p><p>None of the options listed are what I want.&nbsp; I want the nslu2 to just read the radvd broadcast and configure it&#039;s IPv6 address, just like my desktop computers, laptops, tablets, etc do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could configure a static IPv6 address.&nbsp; But currently I have two IPv6 tunnels available (one for each internet connection).&nbsp; Only one of them is advertised from a router at any given time.&nbsp; I would like my NSLU2 be on the current one I have advertising.</p><p>Any suggestions how I can achieve this?</p><p>Is there any way to make my IPv6 configuration appear in the web interface?</p><br /><p>Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>Turns out this was trivially easy.</p><p>opkg install kmod-ipv6</p><p>reboot</p><p>It works.&nbsp; No additional configuration necessary.&nbsp; There appears to be a bug in the web interface where it then reports IPv6 WAN as not connected.&nbsp; But when I look at the network device I see it has indeed configured itself with a correct IPv6 address, and when I go to a commandline prompt, I see I can successfully do &quot;ping6 ipv6.google.com&quot;.</p>									</div>
