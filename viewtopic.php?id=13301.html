					<p>1) Is there ahdemo for broadcom as I cannot seem to find any reference to it in any document on broadcom<br />2) If not will there ever be ahdemo on broadcom?<br />3) I have managed to create two interfaces per device on atheros, one adhoc and one virtual ap. 11a devices seem stable and ok with this but 11bg devices crap out after about a minute or two. Sometimes even the whole thing reboots. Any ideas on this? This is all using only /etc/config/wireless, so it works (if specified in correct order - first adhoc then ap) albeit only for a minute or two. 11a stays up and is stable though.</p>									</div>
