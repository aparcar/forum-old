					<p>Greetings,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am new to the forum but not new to OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have been researching using my Asus WL-520GU as a media streamer.&nbsp; I have enabled usb-audio and related functions, following much of the ideas behind mightyohms wifi radio ala:</p><p><a href="http://mightyohm.com/wifiradio/">http://mightyohm.com/wifiradio/</a></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, I would like to use the sound card to stream the audio from my scanner to provide a stream off of an amateur radio channel.&nbsp; I found that icecast could easily serve up the stream, but I would need Ices to be the source of the stream.&nbsp; I have been reading about cross-compiling programs, but I haven&#039;t quite grasped the concept yet.&nbsp; Searching the forum&#039;s here and google haven&#039;t yielded much information about getting ices (0 or 2) working on openwrt.</p><p>radio----&gt;usb-soundcard----&gt;encoded and served by openwrt using icecast----&gt;client</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>
