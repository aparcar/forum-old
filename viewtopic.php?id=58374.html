					<p>Hello WRT guys,</p><p>I bought a NEXX WT3020H model with 8MB ram. The default NEXX-software is installed.

					<p>Hey Larz, <br />I&#039;m a newbie myself , (and also Dutch) </p><p>The H version (WT3020H) also has 8MB flash so you should be safe if i understand it correct. <br />Some people who have the 4MB flash (the WT3020A) have bricked the NEXX because they tried to flash the 8M firmware onto a 4M flash, that doesn&#039;t fit, and then they have a nice hockey puck...</p><p>I&#039;m myself trying to figure out if it is worth the risk to also flash a new U-BOOT on it. The way it is written in the wiki is not fully clear to me yet.</p><p>Again, i&#039;m new to this myself so i hope someone can confirm if i&#039;m correct or giving bad advice.</p><p>--------EDIT------<br />one more question, are you planning to flash OPENWRT trough the web interface, or with a serial cable connection?

					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I think Larz is right, the latest trunk seems to brick the device.<br />Luckily I flashed the patched U-Boot, mentioned in the wiki earlier:</p><p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!jdRECSxA!tq4kk0zHI6aVbDfXVdNBYf5sXXbu7xw4SsvxoP9gYe4">https://mega.co.nz/#!jdRECSxA!tq4kk0zHI … svxoP9gYe4</a></p><p>So I could easily recover the old System image which came with the modified U-Boot archive (see the link).</p><p>I have no Idea what&#039;s wrong with the current trunk version, since I don&#039;t have a serial Terminal connected :-(&nbsp; After the latest Trunk <br />or the 15.02 RC-2 is flashed, the device is non responisible on 192.168.1.1 -&nbsp; only if you get into the patched U-Boot-Loader (press reset, hold reset, power on until the LED blinks fast) I can connect to 192.168.1.1 again :-(</p><p>The bummer is, I don&#039;t find any&nbsp; package-sources whicht are useable with the openwrt version which was included with the u-Boot archive (see link).</p><p>Does anyone know more about this?&nbsp; Or what I have to do to compile a WORKING version myself? (seems to be some options which confuses the boot process...?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>att15</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey,</p><p>just figured something out....: Its the bootloader mentioned in the wiki whicht causes the Problems.<br />THAT Bootloader was only able to start the included openwrt firmware - any other firmware which should work, did not.</p><p>Now, after I loaded (with the bootloader mentioned in the wiki) the gpl-vioated &quot;breed&quot; version mentioned here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55180">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55180</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;and flashing the latest 15.02 RC2 for this device, it boots without any problem.</p><p>But be aware... the &quot;new&quot; breed bootlader works.... but the webinterface is in some hieroglyphic like characters.... my firefox did only display some &quot;Dice-like Blocks&quot; - but since I new the menu structure from the other bootloader i got along....</p><p>Its a real bummer that the &quot;hack pascal&quot; does not release the sources... not only the GPL demands it; I also demand it.... english pages are not as bad as their reputation... nearly anyone understands at least the characters:-)))</p><p>Just another thought... I wanted to install the gw6c client, but I can&#039;t find it....<br />neither under </p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc2/ramips/mt7620/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm … ps/mt7620/</a> <br />nor any hints why in chaos chalmers Ralink variant the gw6c client is not included any more... (only a real old bug which was fixed a long time ago, a troubleticket said....)</p><br /><p>Cheers,</p><p>ATT15</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>att15</strong> on 11 Jul 2015, 22:45)</p>

					<p>Hey, <br />greetings,</p><p>my first post, first of all this a very good forum and openwrt is a good platform.</p><p>I was looking for download link for modified bootloader with some failsafe features, so that I can play with my nexx wt3020h, also please suggest ways to flash it, currently have no serial reader 3.3v with me, already installed openwrt CC on my box.</p><p>Regards<br />aadhyatm</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aadhyatm</strong> on 17 Apr 2016, 07:10)</p>
