					<p>Hey,<br />I&#039;ve just installed openWrt last week and everything was working fine until yesterday. My WIFI doesn&#039;t want to work anymore. The last thing I changed was the channel (from standard 11 to 9) and I didn&#039;t encounter any problems right after this. WIFI was still working fine, so I don&#039;t think that changing the channel caused the problem (and I tried setting it back, but that didn&#039;t help either).</p><p>But since the evening my Laptop doesn&#039;t find the WIFI anymore.<br />The LuCI Webinterface shows me &quot;Bitrate: ? Mb/s&quot; and &quot;Signal: 0 dBm / Noise: -60 dBm&quot; and the AIR-LED on the Router is off.</p><p>After having no luck fixing it yesterday I just did a fresh install of the Firmware 10.03.1 (the same which was installed before). Problem persists. Last week it worked out of the Box. I just enabled WIFI.</p><p>My /etc/config/wireless looks as follows</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039;
    option &#039;type&#039; &#039;mac80211&#039;
    option &#039;channel&#039; &#039;9&#039;
    option &#039;macaddr&#039; &#039;00:1E:8C:D0:74:76&#039;

config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;
    option &#039;device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039;
    option &#039;network&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
    option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;ap&#039;
    option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;OpenWrt&#039;
    option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;none&#039;</code></pre></div><p>As I read the option macaddr is used to identify the device, I&#039;m a bit confused that all my network devices - shown by ifconfig - are using the same macaddress. Might this be the problem? But removing the option macaddress and using the option phy with phy0 didn&#039;t solve my problem.</p><p>After clicking enable in the WIFI webinterface dmesg shows the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>b43-phy0: Loading firmware version 508.1084 (2009-01-14 01:32:01)
b43-phy0: Loading firmware version 508.1084 (2009-01-14 01:32:01)
device wlan0 entered promiscuous mode
br-lan: port 2(wlan0) entering forwarding state
device wlan0 left promiscuous mode
br-lan: port 2(wlan0) entering disabled state
device wlan0 entered promiscuous mode
br-lan: port 2(wlan0) entering forwarding state</code></pre></div><p>As written I&#039;m using openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx 10.03.01 on an Asus WL500G Premium v1.</p><p>I&#039;d appreciate any help as WIFI is kind of important to me.</p>									</div>
