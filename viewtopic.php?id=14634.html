					<p>I can&#039;t quite understand what constitutes a &#039;complete&#039; openwrt build configation so I can back it up.&nbsp; For BR-6104KP I know I need the top level .config, and also /target/linux/adm5120/router_le/config-*, and it seems also /target/linux/generic-2.6/config-*, but whenever I replace&nbsp; kernel options, even if I replace them in all these files and rebuild from scratch I frequently get kernel config prompts on the next build (and of course, you don&#039;t see them if you are running &#039;make&#039; without V=99, so it just waits forever).</p><p>Any ideas why this happens and what I can do to avoid it?</p><p>thanks.</p>									</div>
