					<p>Hi.</p><p>A couple of years ago, I participated in an experiment as follows.</p><p>Place: between Okinawa Islannd and Kudaka Island<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.ocvb.or.jp/card/en/0120290901.html">http://www.ocvb.or.jp/card/en/0120290901.html</a><br />Distance: over 5km<br />Device: Buffalo WLA-G54C x2, worked as WDS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; These were attached sma connector for antenna.<br />Antenna: 15dBi Yagi antenna x2</p><p>We pinged from the side of Kudaka to the opposite shore. Packets were returned about 2 or 3 ms average.<br />I was under the impression that the airwaves had a good condition on the sea.</p><p>Sorry to say, We didn&#039;t test further. And I don&#039;t know about your condition on the lake. You may need more directional antenna.</p><p>I hope this encourage you.</p><p>regards,</p><p>zukky</p>									</div>

					<p>* line of sight is necessary, with ample diameter (&#039;fresnel zone&#039;) through which the wavefront can propagate. So just over a balcony or roof, or through a slit between buildings is bad news.</p><p>* for just 5 km a 1 mtr yagi on both sides will do; you may also use a 60-70 cm parabola with short yagi feed on both sides. Use very short coax cables, or really good quality SHF coax if it has to be longer (e.g. aircom+); a few meters of ordinary TV coax cable or the thin kind used inside wlan routers will cut the energy by half or worse.<br />To do the &#039;link budget&#039; in a bit more scientific way have a look here:<br /><a href="http://huizen.deds.nl/~pa0hoo/helix_wifi/linkbudgetcalc/wlan_budgetcalc.html">http://huizen.deds.nl/~pa0hoo/helix_wif … tcalc.html</a></p><p>* set &#039;distance&#039; in the radio parameters on both sides to 5000 m (the standard 802.11 protocol timing collapses from a few km onwards and you are left with the minimum 1 Mbps speed); this setting makes the radio wait a a little longer for reception confirmations after having sent something; the radio waves need a tiny bit of extra time due to the distance.</p><p>* in a wrt54g(l) the maximum momentary output RF power is about 80 mW; setting it higher may actually reduce performance as the power amplifier saturate and causes distortion which hampers proper demodulation by the receiver. You&#039;ll have to reduce it quite a bit to not exceed the regulatory limits; but even when reducing power to not exceed limits the link budget will improve by a better antenna because the antenna gain also helps reception.</p><p>If there is no interference, 54 Mbps is totally feasible and ping delays of 1.9 ms. Such a link can transport at ease two 8 Mbps adsl accesses at the same time (useful bitrate in file transfer &gt; 20 Mbps).</p><p>Success !</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 14 Jun 2007, 11:14)</p>

					<p>I was able to achieve a few long-distance links with with some ISP grade antennas and a very long link with a horn antenna I made out of cardboard and aluminum foil... of course the other end was a WiFi ISP so they would have had better equiptment than I did but the results were still impressive:</p><p><a href="http://hastingswireless.homeip.net/index.php?page=man&amp;stage=01">http://hastingswireless.homeip.net/inde … p;stage=01</a></p><p>I&#039;m not sure how well your link will work, going over a lake, since the 2.4 GHz band is in the center of the water absorption spectrum (the reason why microwaves use 2.4 GHz).&nbsp; If your lake has a large number of boats crossing it, try to go for horizontal polarization instead of vertical.&nbsp; While testing my equipment with GTMC, I noticed a significant drop in signal strength every time a vehicle passed on the road to the south.&nbsp; When I switched to horizontal polarization, hardly any drop in signal strength was noticeable.</p><p>Also, try to make the positioning of your antennas result in little to no chopping of the Fresnel zones... do a little research on what they are and how their geometry looks... they are very important to successful transmission (as doddel alluded to).&nbsp; The entire Hastings Wireless project died because of all the (deciduous) trees in town absorbing the signal and chopping the Fresnels.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much for the infos, but the topic is really hard, for some infos in german I would be really glad.<br />But, I want not just a 1MBit/s connection, what I want is a 54MBit/s connection over 5km. Is this with a normal Linksysrouter and Cantenna possible? Of course with LOS and fresnel zone.<br />How can I change the polarization of the antennas?<br />What is about 802.11a instead of b/g? How much are antennas for these devices.</p><p>Offtopic. If I want to set up point-to-point between two houses which are 100-300m far away with antennas (802.11a or b/g) on the roof (LOS): Do I need directional antennas or can I even reach 54MBit/s with normal omni antennas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fabske</strong> on 15 Jun 2007, 11:15)</p>

					<p>The antenna you use will make all the difference.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend either _Parabolics_ or _Yagi_.&nbsp; I&#039;d tip toward Parabolics, since they have the special function of focusing signal at a narrow region (which is where your receiver will be).&nbsp; 21 or 24dbi Parabolics should do.&nbsp; Might try: <a href="http://www.confero24.com/product_info.php?pName=21-dbi-parabolic-grid-antenna&amp;cName=24-ghz-parabolic">http://www.confero24.com/product_info.p … -parabolic</a></p><p>If that&#039;s doesn&#039;t cut it, include a booster at transmitter or receiver end (or both!).&nbsp; Try: <a href="http://www.confero24.com/index.php?cName=500mw-boosters">http://www.confero24.com/index.php?cName=500mw-boosters</a></p><p>Whatever you do, try not to lose too much signal in to things like cables connectors etc.</p><p>Any yes, of all the affordable router-radios out there - Linksys wrt54g(l) products have most powerful output - safe bet.</p><p>Good luck! / <a href="http://www.confero24.com">www.confero24.com</a></p>									</div>
