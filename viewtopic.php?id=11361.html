					<p>I tested on a Meraki mini about a month ago with madwifi.&nbsp; The link was only about 1/4 mile, had an rssi of -61, but the link had horrible packet loss.&nbsp; (10 to 20%)&nbsp; &nbsp;The same link with a Buffalo WHR-G54S maintains less than 1% packet loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is some interference in the area, so some packet loss is expected.&nbsp; </p><p>As of that testing (r7262) I would consider it unusable.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will test again soon and post in this forum my results.</p>									</div>
