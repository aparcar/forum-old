					<p>Hi,</p><p>i am using an asus WL-HDD as a UPnP music server (twonky) in combination with SLA5500 music clients. For controlling these clients i use an ipaq with rudeo control.<br />When a song has ended the rudeo control very often does not advance to the next song. Rudeo says that this is because of lost UDP messages from the music client telling the rudeo control software that the current song has ended.</p><p>What can I do about this, any ideas? The WL-HDD is exclusively for mp3 streaming so there isn&#039;t very much wlan traffic that could jam the udp messages.</p><p>Konrad</p>									</div>
