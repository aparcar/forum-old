					<p>Please help me with the interfaces of Kamikaze and Chillispot in Meraki. </p><p>I have tried pretty much everything but I cannot make it work. My PC gets IP-address from Chilli, but then gets directly to net or then does not go anywhere. The splash page persistently stays out of my reach. The page itself works OK when connected directly with the browser.</p><p>I know that I should somehow separate eth0 and ath0 to get them connected by Chilli only, but cannot find the trick. Somebody please help me out, as I have spent a very long time to this and I am pretty close to desperate here.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I am using 7.09. </p><p>Should I downgrade to... which build? Or is there some other known workaround?</p><p>Now I have also noticed that brctl does not save the changes in bridging. The changes do take place but they are lost after restart. Any ideas about that?</p>									</div>
