					<p>Hi guys, sorry if this isn&#039;t the right section to post in. </p><p>I&#039;m currently trying to capture an open wireless access point that I do not have hardware/admin access to, providing free (legal) internet. I&#039;d like to run a long cable inside my house, then provide another AP for devices to connect to the internet. </p><p>I have been using Gargoyle 1.9.2 on a WNDR3800 with some success as a totally wireless repeater, but I was wondering if openWrt might be better suited/have more options for the full system. </p><p>I intend to use an old router-modem inside the house. I am assuming this can be simply bridged without needing to install openWrt.</p><p>If this sounds possible so far, what specific modes/configurations would you recommend for openWrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jocogi</strong> on 19 Jun 2017, 17:21)</p>

					<p>Use a routed client on the outdoor unit.&nbsp; All routing decisions will be made there.&nbsp; Then as you said, you can connect an Ethernet cable and bridge in almost any router with stock firmware (you need to be able to turn off DHCP) as a dumb AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Of course you can do as mk24 said, adding the internal router as &quot;dumb AP&quot; and let the external router do everything.<br />But from a security point of view, I&#039;d rather not have an unsecured rj45 wire across my backyard which belongs to the &quot;Windows Home Zone&quot; and all my personal devices respond to pretty much unrestricted.</p><p>I&#039;d suggest to have the external device just as mk24 suggested and add an internal router that uses the rj45 uplink coming from the backyard as regular WAN connection. You can avoid NAT since you control both OpenWRT devices, but I&#039;d definitively not put my primary gateway out in the open ragen.</p><p>And yes, I hate wifi cameras mounted outside of my house for the very same reason: They usually provide link access to a network that should not be exposed.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
