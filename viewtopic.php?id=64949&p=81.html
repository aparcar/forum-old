					<p>There was a commit 6 months ago or so that IMHO has screwed the flashing process by LuCi up.&nbsp; Sometimes flashing using .bin works, and other times it doesn&#039;t. We used to be able to flash with LuCi using .img, but now that never works (From Stock to Lede works). So, most of the times I end up needing to sysupgrade -F from command line.</p><br /><p>BTW -- No issues putting this on the site if most think this makes the most sense?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>2.

					<p>I leave the downstream set to 0 (disabled) as my provider is rock solid down. Then I set the upload to a value that gives me good speeds without buffer bloat when tested on dslreports. With that setup I get all A&#039;s and if I play with the upload I can get A+. Being lazy I let all A&#039;s be good enough.<br />Got the downstream tip from somewhere, don&#039;t remember where.
