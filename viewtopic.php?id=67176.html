					<p>Hello</p><p>Looking for some help/advise, my current setup is as follows:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>wlan0: mode &quot;ap&quot;, network &quot;wan&quot;<br />wan: ifname &quot;eth0&quot;, proto &quot;dhcp&quot;, type &quot;bridge&quot;<br />Basically a straight up bridge between eth0 and wlan0, which is facilitated by the interface &quot;br-wan&quot;</p><p>wlan1: mode &quot;ap&quot;, network is &quot;lan&quot;<br />lan: type &quot;bridge&quot;<br />Standard lan setup, resulting in the interface br-lan, but I have configured iptables masquerades outgoing packets from br-lan and sends them to br-wan (probably will change this at some point as this setup doesn&#039;t make sense for what I&#039;m doing, but it works so oh well)</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve just setup a new interface wlan2 in station mode, and this is where I&#039;m looking for some assistance. I&#039;d like to change my setup so instead of having all packets from the wlan interfaces come out on the &quot;wan&quot; interface (eth0) I&#039;d like to use the &quot;wwan&quot; interface (which I&#039;d like to link to wlan2).</p><p>So far I&#039;ve created the interface &quot;wlan2&quot; in the wireless config, set it&#039;s mode, provided the ssid and key of the hotspot to connect to, and set the network option to &quot;wwan&quot;.&nbsp; The &quot;wwan&quot; interface has it&#039;s proto set to &quot;dhcp&quot;, and so far that seems to work, ifconfig shows wlan2 received an IP Address and the device is reachable on the network at that IP Address.</p><p>I then tried adding &quot;type &#039;bridge&#039;&quot; to the &quot;wwan&quot; interface, which did create the interface &quot;br-wwan&quot;, but while &quot;br-wan&quot; has DHCP information, &quot;br-wwan&quot; does not and neither does &quot;wlan2&quot; anymore.</p><p>So how would I move past this issue so that I can bridge &quot;wlan0&quot; with &quot;wlan2&quot; (assumedly using the &quot;br-wwan&quot; interface) and thus allowing me to change my iptables rules so traffic from &quot;wlan1&quot; is forwarded to &quot;br-wwan&quot;?</p><p>Thank you<br />Aaron</p><p>Note that I have the firewall service disabled and am managing iptables rules myself due to the complexity of the rules.</p><p>Bellow you&#039;ll find extracts from the relevant config files, I&#039;ve excluded sections and options which are not relevant or should not be shown (ssids and keys for example).</p><p>wireless config:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-iface
