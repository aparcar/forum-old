					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to create a fw rule on Barrier Breaker to allow imap traffic for Google mail.<br />As the host name is resolving to multiple IP address, I would like to make use of ipset-dns which has been superseded by dnsmasq-full. </p><p>However, I found no guide or doc explaining how to create an ipset rule allowing imap traffic and this with dnsmasq creating the ipset-dns object.</p><p>Has anyone any link to a doc explaining how to do this ? Or if you can provide example <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks in advance for the help,</p>									</div>
