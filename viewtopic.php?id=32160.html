					<p>I e-mailed you an explanation, but I wanted to take a moment to answer your post.</p><p>The short answer is this:</p><p>The APs should only carry the same SSID if they share the same ethernet address space, such as by bridge mode (see fyi&#039;s link to Dumb AP below). </p><p>If your WNDR3700 can do bridge mode, then this should work. If it cannot do bridge mode, you should configure three separate SSIDs for the three APs.</p><p>There are a lot of technical reasons for this. I won&#039;t bother to explain further unless someone asks me to. By all means, ask if you wish.</p><p>Otherwise, if you are satisfied with this answer I&#039;ll leave well enough alone. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>v.90</strong> on 30 Sep 2011, 21:32)</p>
