					<p>I got further, now i am able to ping the router and tranfser via tftp. I had to reset flash by opening the box and shorting pins 15 and 16.</p><p>Even after i transfer the firmware, including the 4.03 firmware from motorola, i get red power LED and nothing else. It never boots normally. Seems like there is something i can do like, resetting flash memory to bring this back online.</p>									</div>

					<p>finally i got it fixed. I had to flash via the console using the flash -noheader option.</p><p>I used the firmware &quot;openwrt-generic-jffs2-4MB.trx&quot;</p><p>This seem to have solved the problem of getting the openwrt on to the router. Now all set to play with the new open source firmware.</p><p>Also how do i get back to the OEM firmware if i have to. When i try to load it using the same flash -noheader option, it flashes fine but at reboot it says &quot;Invalid boot block on disk&quot;.</p><p>thanks for all the efforts of the people on thsi forum.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!<br />If it is still relevan to you , wen1 , I&#039;ll tell you what I have done to return the original firmware.<br />I&#039;ll open with a fact that I also had same problem with tftp and so on...<br />Someone on the irc suggested me to take the brcm-openwrt&nbsp; image , and I was surprised to find out that it worked.Then I started checking why the motorola-openwrt and original wr850g_v403 don&#039;t work.<br />Well, the reason is in a file format, or actually in a file header. Brcm image is a real .trx image and that is a reason for successful TFTP for it.Motorola-openWRT and original motorola firmware are in a .bin format, and that is why router didn&#039;t &quot;understand&quot; them.<br />Now, to the part you were waiting for. In order to go back to your motorola firmware you should do the following :<br />1)Obtain some hex editor and run it .<br />2) Open both brcm-openwrt image and your wr850g_V403 image.<br />3) Compare the file headers and remove unneeded prefix (32 bytes if I recall right) from wr850g image.<br />If you compare the headers, you&#039;ll see what I mean.<br />4)Save modified wr850g firmware.<br />5 a)TFTP it to router (that one I didn&#039;t try , but it should work).<br />5 b) Tested one:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |)Setup an ftp server on your computer (192.168.1.2 for examle).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;||)Open telnet to your router (that now runs openWRT firmware) and type:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wget <a href="ftp://192.168.1.2/wr850g.trx">ftp://192.168.1.2/wr850g.trx</a> (for instance).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; |||) After successful file transfer (hopefully) , you should type :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mtd -r write wr850g.trx linux<br />6)If all went ok so far , then now you have your original motorola firmware running on the router.<br />7)Enjoy!</p><p>I&#039;ll be glad to hear if it worked for you,<br />Fox Mulder.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found some interesting things about the wrt54g debrick utility when trying to erase or flash the NVRAM on the Motorola WR850G v3.&nbsp; </p><p>The program will not ERASE the flash in that location of the NVRAM 1fff0000.&nbsp; If you attempt to flash that area it does try to erase it but really does not and then will only overwrite the nvram area with your nvram.bin by changing any 0 bits to a 1.&nbsp; Trying to erase the NVRAM with the command wrt54g.exe -erase:nvram will not erase anything.&nbsp; Trying to flash the NVRAM will result in a corrupted NVRAM because the program does not erase before flashing.&nbsp; &nbsp;The -erase:nvram should change all bytes in the nvram area to FF but it doesn&#039;t - just gives the 0 blocks erased message.&nbsp; </p><p>I believe this is happening because the minimum block size for the debrick utility is 128K and the flash area is only 64K.&nbsp; </p><p>To get around this, I used a custom erase of <br />wrt54g.exe -erase:custom /window:1fc00000 /start:1ffe0000 /length:1&nbsp; This will erase the upper 64K of the kernel (which isn&#039;t being used anyway) along with the entire 64K of NVRAM in flash memory.&nbsp; Then I&#039;ve been able to flash a new NVRAM.BIN or just let the CFE create a new one. </p><p>Jeff</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dobkin</strong> on 29 Dec 2010, 02:36)</p>
