					<p>Hello, I&#039;d like to get an automatic wake on LAN, which means that the router itself wake up asleep clients when a service is required from them.<br />Then, I need to modified some package to get this point. I need some help with which package should I modified, maybe &quot;iptables&quot;, or maybe &quot;bridge-utils&quot;. I don&#039;t really know.</p><p>Which package should I study in order to understand the code and be able to modified it. The ideal one would be that package where all the frames are filtered.</p>									</div>
