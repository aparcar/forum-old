					<p>I just upgraded to the openwrt (experimental)&nbsp; firmware from the sveasoft alchemy firmware. I have a wrt54g v 3. I noticed that the ip adress of the router did not change. I ran firstboot and if said it had already been run. My problem is I have it plugged into my wrt54gs router right now and i want to get out to the inter net from the g (wrt54gs switch port 4 &lt;==&gt; wrt54g port 1)</p>									</div>
