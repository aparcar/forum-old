					<p>This problem is some what strange! <br />My Linksys WRT350N&nbsp; sets wifi and network settings to defaults after each reboot.&nbsp; All other settings (root password, firewall rules, qos settings ...) won&#039;t change.<br />The funny thing is, if I reflash the firmware without keeping the configurations, after the reboot, those settings that won&#039;t change on reboots are still set!<br />For example, after a clean flash,when the luci login interface shows up, It shows the red box with the message &quot;set a root password&quot;, but if I refresh the page, the message is gone and I can login using my old password.<br />I&#039;m using backfire 10.03.1 lastest svn.</p>									</div>

					<p>check to make sure that your image is not too large and causing some sort of read-only state.&nbsp; I had this happen to me in&nbsp; a trunk I made that was too large by a very small amount, the image built but I could not correctly save config changes.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did check that, I even stripped out some of the default packages from image, but the problem still exists.<br />One of the things I didn&#039;t mention in my first post is that if I install a package, then flash the router with the same image (which obviously didn&#039;t have that package) after reboot, the package is still there as if I installed it again!!<br />You see, this problem is some what confusing, I think there is a problem with the /overlay mapping but I can not pin point the problem. Why on the earth, even packages keep their states between reflashings, but these two config files revert back to their original after just a reboot?</p>									</div>
