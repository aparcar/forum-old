					<p>Hi wvdakker, thank you very much for answering!<br />Today I had the time to try your instructions, but still without success :-(<br />I successfully loaded the u-boot.asc in ram, then tried to follow the instructions in the wiki, &quot;U-Boot CLI commands&quot; using the image from trunk. The tftp seemed to work, but then I tried to disable uart and boot and it still doesn&#039;t boot, stays at &quot;ROM VER: 1.0.3...&quot; like before.<br />Maybe the procedure wasn&#039;t right?

					<p>The problem is that the kernel (+squashfs) is not flashed at the address where the kernel expects it to be, and so it cannot find the beginning of the squashfs to mount it.<br />According to the bootlog, the kernel expects uImage to start at 128kB. You can change the file target/linux/lantiq/dts/GIGASX76X.dts to make the internal partition table match the actual situation. (On my box my u-boot was more than 128kB, when I remember well, so my uImage had to start on 256kB).</p><p>When you are editing this table, maybe you&#039;d better leave the last 64kB. I never got my wireless working, and maybe it needed some data from that last 64kB.</p>									</div>
