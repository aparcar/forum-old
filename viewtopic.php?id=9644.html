					<p>I am working on porting Kamikaze to the Routerboard 100 series of boards by Microtik.&nbsp; Using a patch from Microtik for the 2.4.31 kernel, I can get the system up and booting.&nbsp; However there are still several issues I need to resolve:</p><p>1) Some of my packages are not getting adding to my filesystem tarball. Specifically ebtables is getting built and generating an ipkg, but the modules don&#039;t show in my build_mipsel/root directory.</p><p>2) I don&#039;t have any device nodes in /dev&nbsp; I have created those by hand in order to get the system to boot.&nbsp; Am I supposed to be using devfs to create them or is there a script that does it or do I need to write my own script?</p><p>3) I don&#039;t get a serial console.&nbsp; rcS seems to hang after all the startup scripts finish and the output gets passed to logger.&nbsp; If I comment out the logger and start /bin/ash from rcS, I get a console.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t run ash from rcS, it just hangs and never returns to inittab.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Hampton</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cobar</strong> on 28 Feb 2007, 00:57)</p>
