					<p>Support for devices with only 16 MB RAM has officially been discontinued with Attitude Adjustment 12.09 (even 32 MB RAM is very borderline today), although that formal declaration only happened after the fact that this little amount of RAM was posing serious problems before already. While it is still possible to create a very targetted and stripped down build for 4/16 devices today, using current LEDE master, the results are definately not a full-featured firmware (luci is definately not possible, but it doesn&#039;t stop there) and still hitting out of memory conditions (or more colloquial, crashes and freezes) left and right.</p><p>While reverting to older firmware builds is technically possible, their security status precludes this from being a serious option (8+ years of known and unfixed/ unfixable security bugs, including remote ones), at some point it&#039;s no longer sensible to use 14 years old devices with very limiting system specifications. See <a href="https://lede-project.org/meta/infobox/432_warning">https://lede-project.org/meta/infobox/432_warning</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 8 Jan 2018, 00:10)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the pointer @slh</p><p>The page brings up the possibility of generating images of various sizes.

					<p>1) No.</p><p>2) Yes, the fixes are in LEDE 17.01.x/ OpenWrt master - but not in any earlier version, those haven&#039;t been touched since their release. The problem just is that your 14-year-old 16 MB RAM device doesn&#039;t meet minimum system requirements (&gt;32 MB RAM) for current (&gt;2010)/ fixed firmware images anymore and would just crash and burn if you tried a release build.</p>									</div>
