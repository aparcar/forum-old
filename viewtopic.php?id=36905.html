					<p>Hello,</p><p>I had a lightning stike on my house and it seems the wan port of my WRT54GL has taken a bit of a hit. I had an ethernet modem connected to it (its port seems dead too)</p><p>However the router is very much alive and I can log in using ssh. The other ethernet ports are fine too. So i&#039;d like to know if it&#039;s possible to change the wan port to use one of the LAN port instead. (the current WAN port is called eth0.1 in LUCI).</p><p>On my own i stayed on luci (without success) in order not to mess up the config too bad, but I&#039;m not afraid to go $vim if you want me to edit config files.</p><p>Oh, and if I do manage to change the interface port, will the firewall follow, or will there be a direct connection with WAN and LAN. (I tried reading the manual but lost myself in the LAN/VLAN/Bridge etc)</p><p>[Version infos]<br />when i log in with ssh I get :</p><p>BusyBox v1.15.3 (2010-05-10 18:32:01 CEST) built-in shell (ash)<br />Backfire (10.03) mod by tytan</p><br /><p>regards<br />tutux</p><p>PS : please excuse my english, i&#039;m french.</p>									</div>
