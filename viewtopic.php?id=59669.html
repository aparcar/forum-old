					<p>uci doc says that uci state vars are deprecated and shouldn&#039;t be used, however some uci defaults scripts are still using them.</p><p>Should I be using them as well or should I switch and start using /lib/functions/network.sh for uci defaults script?</p><p>thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 16 Sep 2015, 13:37)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your contribution. Now I&#039;d like to hear from one of the developers or someone who has used the network.sh functions in uci-defaults scripts.<br />I know that a lot of things are not available for uci-defaults scripts so I&#039;d like to confirm that the new suggested method works.</p>									</div>
