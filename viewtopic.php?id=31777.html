					<p>Hi. Router is a WRT54GL, is in my room, and roommates are all on wireless. Talking to them is not an option.</p><p>I currently have Tomato with QoS enabled, but is does nothing. I only enabled the very basic default settings because I simply use my desktop&#039;s MAC address set to high and everything else to low. Specifically, here are my settings: </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1).Under &quot;QoS&quot;, &quot;Classification&quot; tab:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A).Outbound Direction<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; B).Match Rule&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Class&nbsp; &nbsp; Description<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; C).From (my MAC address)&nbsp; &nbsp; Highest&nbsp; &nbsp; Name</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2).Under &quot;QoS&quot;, &quot;Basic Settings&quot; tab:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A).(ACK&nbsp; &nbsp;SYN&nbsp; &nbsp;FIN&nbsp; &nbsp;RST&nbsp; Prioritize ICMP) are all not enabled. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; B).Outbound rate/limit: Max bandwidth: 25000kbit/s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; C).Lowest 1% - 100% (=250-25000 kbit/s)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3).Inbound Limit: Max Bandwidth: 5000 kbit/s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A).Lowest 100% (=5,000 kbit/s)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4).&quot;TCP Vegas&quot; is not enabled.</p><p>I still get quite poor pings (500ms-1,000ms at times) when they are online doing their thing. I honestly see no difference between when QoS was not enabled. I would like very much to install custom firmware that lets me limit each of them to only 10% each, leaving me with 70%. If that&#039;s not possible I would just like QoS to at least do something... why isn&#039;t setting all traffic to my MAC address to the highest class and everything else to low not working? Should I instead set everything to normal and set their MAC addresses to lowest? Please help and TY for reading.</p>									</div>

					<p>Try using <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com">www.gargoyle-router.com</a> (based on OpenWRT).&nbsp; It has advanced QoS and active congestion control which can maintain your ping times.&nbsp; Please use v1.4.0 as the lastest version 1.4.1 has some minor issues with QoS that cropped up. (Now fixed in v1.4.2)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pbix</strong> on 19 Sep 2011, 15:03)</p>

					<p>Thanks, I&#039;ll probably go ahead and install it anyways, but.... my WRT54GL v1.1 router has only16 MB RAM, 4 MB FLASH, which is the minimum req, but Gargoyle recommends: &quot;at least 32MB of flash and 8MB of RAM&quot;. </p><p>Tbh, I&#039;m not sure what difference more memory would make in a router? Don&#039;t they both still perform the exact same way? Would my bandwidth or connection be slower compared to a router with more memory? Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Gargoyle can run on your WRT54GL but with limited FLASH/RAM you will not be able to install many of the cool optional packages available for OpenWRT.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you run out of memory on your router you will experience reboots, loss of connections and/or the inability to make new connections.&nbsp; The top end speed of the WRT54GL with Gargoyle is around 8Mbps through the WAN link and not strongly affected by RAM or FLASH size.&nbsp; Top end speeds are strongly affected by the CPU in your router and the software you load (ie Tomato, DD-WRT, OpenWRT etc).</p><p>For you and a couple of roommates and a 5Mbps link I think you have a good chance of success with Gargoyle and the WRT54GL.</p>									</div>
