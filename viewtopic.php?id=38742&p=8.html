					<p>Okay, you have two options. D-Link recovery and OpenWRT Generic Failsafe Mode.</p><p>For the D-Link recovery you have to press reset while powering the DIR-505 up. After that you can open <a href="http://192.168">http://192.168</a>.<strong>0</strong>.1 where you can upload the original D-Link Firmware or an OpenWRT bin. This procedure is described here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-505#debricking.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-505#debricking.</a></p><p>For the generic failsafe mode you can follow <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a> You can use the WPS button for that. While booting up, just press it several times until the LED flashes very quick. If you&#039;re still not able to telnet it on 192.168.<strong>1</strong>.1 maybe there&#039;s something wrong on the client-side. May I ask which operating system you are using?</p><p>In OS-X for example, you can rearrange the priority of the interfaces. Usually I&#039;m connected via WiFi and the IP 192.168.0.x. My ethernet (non-WiFi) interface is in the 192.168.1.x range. Each interface needs to get its own gateway and dns setting, lets say 192.168.0.1 for wifi and 192.168.1.1 for ethernet. However, sometimes this doesn&#039;t work. So when I try to reach the DIR-505 from my browser or from the terminal, I get a &quot;No route to host&quot; error message. After changing the interface priority (ethernet over wifi) it works. Maybe this helps you, though I don&#039;t know how this is done with windows.</p>									</div>

As I mentioned earlier, I can get the unit into an apparent emergency recovery mode where the LED flashes red 2 seonds, off one second. Once it&#039;s doing that, I set the IP of my PC to 192.168.0.10 and the interface comes up. I can never ping 192.168.0.1 nor can I reach a web interface. I&#039;ve tried multiple times and veried various things to get something to happen. I put a switch between my pc and the 505, which didn&#039;t change anything, and I&#039;ve run wireshark while connecting, and power cycling the 505, and cannot see it doing anything that gives me any clues.</p><p>I&#039;m just about to call D-Link support but I feel like I&quot;ll be chasing my tail on that endeavor. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks for not giving up on me yet!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Just an update for anyone else who may have a similar issue. It seems that the static IP addressing I was doing on my test machine was being somehow wrecked by the virtualization layer in the network adapter. Everything looked good in the network config and wireshark, but somewhere in the network subsystem, it was not operable.</p><p>I switched to a different machine and everything started working as expected.</p><p>Thanks to everyone for all for the help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright. I just bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-Systems-SharePort-Companion-DIR-505L/dp/B009LENJ90/">DIR-505<strong>L</strong></a> on a whim because it was cheap ($25) and because I saw I could install OpenWrt on it, from this thread. There are three versions of this thing, as far as I&#039;ve been able to tell by Googling. These are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>DIR-505LA1</strong> - This is what I got. It&#039;s the current standard US model.</p></li><li><p><strong>DIR-505LA2</strong> - Judging from what I&#039;ve read, this is identical to the US model, but it has exchangeable electric plugs for the European market</p></li><li><p><strong>DIR-505</strong> - This is the older model. It doesn&#039;t have the &quot;<em>Charger</em>&quot; mode on the side.</p></li></ul><p>Now, I&#039;ve installed DD-WRT on a couple routers in the past, but that was cakewalk compared to OpenWrt. I&#039;ve never used OpenWrt, before, so this was my first time trying to get it installed. After screwing up the network settings multiple times requiring factory resets/reflashing, I made a guide for myself and my friends on how to get OpenWrt up and running on this little device. I figured that since I already made the guide for my own use, I might as well post it here for others who are new to OpenWrt. I&#039;m happy to say that this thing is up-and-running perfectly for my setup; but even if you have a complicated environment for yours, by the time you finish my guide, you should be in a good position to understand how to setup and configure your new OpenWrt DIR-505L device.</p><p>I actually wrote my guide just as a simple .txt (which I&#039;ve uploaded to <a href="http://pastebin.com/iw3eRHNP">pastebin</a>), but I&#039;ll try to reformat it with BBCode for the forums, here.</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Oh, and if anyone wants to know what the throughput on this little thing is, here are some of my speedtest results.</p><p>Ethernet cable plugged directly into my computer:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/3445742161.png" alt="http://www.speedtest.net/result/3445742161.png" /></span></p><p>Ethernet cable plugged into my router; my computer connected via 802.11n wifi:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/3445739156.png" alt="http://www.speedtest.net/result/3445739156.png" /></span></p><br /><p><strong>-----------------------------</strong></p><h5><strong><span class="bbu">How to install OpenWrt on a D-Link 505L:</span></strong></h5><br /><h5>A.

If you get a &quot;<em>connection refused</em>&quot; error, see the <strong><span class="bbu">NOTE</span></strong> below.</p></li><li><p>It&#039;s time to set up the network. In your SSH terminal, run the following commands to set up your router&#039;s ethernet (<em>eth1</em>) to connect to the internet and split your router&#039;s LAN and WAN.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>uci set network.wan=interface</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>uci set network.wan.proto=dhcp</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>uci set network.wan.ifname=eth1</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>uci del network.lan.ifname</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>uci commit</em></p></li><li><p>Now enable wifi by running these commands.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>uci set wireless.@wifi-device[0].disabled=0</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>uci commit wireless</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>wifi</em></p></li><li><p>You can disconnect the ethernet cable from the router to your computer. Plug your internet ethernet cable into the router, and then connect to the new &quot;OpenWrt&quot; wifi hotspot.</p></li><li><p>You may have to power cycle the router, your modem, or both, but eventually you should have the internet plugged into the DIR-505L via ethernet, you should be connected to the &quot;<em>OpenWrt</em>&quot; wifi hotspot, and you should be able to use the internet. Now it&#039;s time to install the web gui, <em>LuCI</em>.</p></li></ol><p><strong><span class="bbu">NOTE:</span></strong> If you get a &quot;connection refused&quot; error, wait a few minutes and try, again. It can take a few minutes for the SSH server to begin working after telnet shuts down. If you can neither connect through telnet or ssh, you may need to do a factory reset. You can try to repeat the steps to get to the <strong>EMERGENCY FLASH page</strong>, or you can use OpenWrt&#039;s built-in failsafe mode. Activate failsafe mode by repeatedly pressing the WPS button on the DIR-505L as soon as you plug it into a power outlet. Failsafe mode will ~NOT~ activate if anything is plugged into the router&#039;s ethernet port, so make sure you unplug your ethernet cable before trying to activate failsafe mode. If failsafe mode activates, the green power LED should begin to flash ~very~ rapidly. You will then need to change your ethernet adapter&#039;s IP address, similar to before. Set your IP address to <em>192.168.1.2</em> with subnet mask <em>255.255.255.0</em>. You should be able to open a telnet session with <em>192.168.1.1</em>. Once in failsafe mode with a telnet session open, you should follow the steps, here.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe#in.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/gener … lsafe.mode</a></p><p>Use these commands in the telnet session to factory reset and reboot your OpenWrt router.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>mount_root</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>firstboot</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>mtd -r erase rootfs_data</em></p><p>When the router reboots, you&#039;ll repeat the process like you just flashed a new OpenWrt. Return your ethernet adapter settings to <em>obtain an IP address and DNS automatically</em>, open a telnet session, use <em>passwd</em>, and try to open an ssh session, again. Continue from the ssh session. If you get &quot;<em>connection refused</em>&quot;, again, you may have to delete your SSH authentication certificates. On a *nix system, these might be found in the folder, &quot;<em>~/.ssh/</em>&quot;. I had this problem, and I was able to connect via SSH once I deleted <em>~/.ssh/known_hosts</em>.</p><br /><h5>F. Install the web GUI, LuCI</h5><ol class="decimal"><li><p>You should be connected to your router via wifi. SSH to your router, located at <em>192.168.1.1</em>, and run the folllowing commands to install LuCI.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>opkg update</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>opkg install luci-ssl</em></p></li><li><p>When the installation is successful, run these commands to start the web gui and enable it on router boot.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>/etc/init.d/uhttpd start</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable</em></p></li><li><p>Open your browser to <em>192.168.1.1</em>, and login to your new web GUI. We&#039;re going to update the version of OpenWrt, now by using LuCI to flash the <span class="bbu">*dir-505*-sysupgrade.bin</span>.</p></li><li><p>Once logged into the web gui, go to <strong>System &gt; Backup / Flash Firmware</strong>. Flash your <span class="bbu">*dir-505*-sysupgrade.bin</span>, and make sure to check, &quot;<em>Keep settings</em>&quot;.</p></li><li><p>When the firmware is flashed and the router reboots, you need to re-enable the LuCI web gui. After reconnecting to the &quot;OpenWrt&quot; wifi hotspot, simply open an ssh connection to your router (<em>ssh root@192.168.1.1</em>), and run these commands, again.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>opkg update</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>opkg install luci-ssl</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>/etc/init.d/uhttpd start</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable</em></p></li><li><p>Finally, you can exit the ssh session, point your browser to <em>192.168.1.1</em>, login to your web gui, and configure your router to your liking.</p></li></ol><br /><h5>G. Set your router to reboot once per week</h5><ul><li><p><a href="http://www.smallbusinesstech.net/more-complicated-instructions/openwrt/configuring-openwrt-to-automatically-reboot-every-week-1">http://www.smallbusinesstech.net/more-c … ery-week-1</a></p></li></ul><ol class="decimal"><li><p>If you don&#039;t need the router to be connected to the internet without interruption, I recommend setting it up to reboot once per week to maintain stability. To do that, login to LuCI and browse to <strong>System &gt; Scheduled Tasks</strong>. This page allows you to edit the <em>crontab</em> file. Add the following line to the scheduled tasks textbox (i.e., crontab file),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>0 3 * * 0 reboot</em></p></li></ol><ul><li><p>The first number denotes the minute (0-59). In this case, 0 represents the top of the hour.</p></li><li><p>The second number denotes the hour (0-23). In this case, 3 represents 3 AM.</p></li><li><p>The third number denotes the day of the month (1-31). In this case, * matches any day of the month, so this field is ignored.</p></li><li><p>The fourth number denotes the month of the year (1-12). In this case, * matches any day of the month, so this field is ignored.</p></li><li><p>The fifth number denotes the day of the week (0-6) beginning with Sunday. In this case, 0 represents Sunday.</p></li><li><p>The final item is the command to be run. The crontab runs with root privileges, so it has power to reboot the device.</p></li></ul><br /><h5>H. Use alternate DNS servers</h5><ol class="decimal"><li><p>You may be interested to use alternate DNS servers instead of your default ISP ones. To do this, open up your LuCI web gui and go to <strong>Network &gt; Interfaces &gt; WAN &gt; Edit &gt; Advanced Settings</strong>. Uncheck the &quot;<em>Use DNS servers advertised by peer</em>&quot; box, and then enter whichever servers you want in the &quot;<em>Use custom DNS servers</em>&quot; box. Some recommendations include:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Level 3:</strong> <em>4.2.2.1</em> and <em>4.2.2.2</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Google DNS:</strong> <em>8.8.8.8</em> and <em>8.8.4.4</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>OpenDNS:</strong> <em>208.67.222.222</em> and <em>208.67.220.220</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>DNS Advantage:</strong> <em>156.154.70.1</em> and <em>156.154.71.1</em></p></li><li><p>Also try GRC&#039;s DNS benchmark tool.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.grc.com/dns/Benchmark.htm">https://www.grc.com/dns/Benchmark.htm</a></p></li></ol><br /><h5>I. Install more packages</h5><ol class="decimal"><li><p>You might want to install some packages to further enhance your router&#039;s features. Useful packages might include:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>UPnP</strong> (<em>luci-app-upnp</em>, <em>miniupnpd</em>)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Dynamic DNS</strong> (<em>luci-app-ddns</em>, <em>ddns-scripts</em>)</p></li></ol><br /><h5>J. Other Notes</h5><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Some people are having problems resolving hostnames from their internal network. For instance, if they plug their network ethernet cable directly into their computer, they can access hostname &quot;<em>example</em>&quot;, but if they try to connect to that hostname from their OpenWrt router, it doesn&#039;t work. Instead, they have to use the whole domain name, &quot;<em>example</em>.<strong>domain.com</strong>&quot;. To fix this, people have been going to their LuCI web GUI, then to <strong>Network &gt; DHCP and DNS</strong>. In <strong>General Settings</strong>, uncheck <em>Domain required</em>, <em>Authoritative</em>, and <em>Rebind protection</em>. Then in <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> uncheck <em>Filter private</em>. I personally have this hostname resolving problem, but unchecking these options didn&#039;t fix it. It seems like it fixed a lot of other people&#039;s, though. Your mileage my vary.</p></li></ol>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>masamunecyrus</strong> on 21 Apr 2014, 00:56)</p>

					<p>thanks.&nbsp; I did set a static IP on my computer&#039;s NIC of 192.168.1.2.&nbsp; It still doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this dance a couple times now.&nbsp; I tried the WPS button pressing to try and get it in to failsafe mode, but that doesn&#039;t affect the LED, so I&#039;m thinking something might be up with the current version in trunk?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so I got this working after many flashes.&nbsp; &nbsp;It took me a couple hex editors and two operating systems.&nbsp; The thing that wasn&#039;t apparent to me is that the number of&nbsp; periods/dots/etc between the two pieces of text is somehow important(maybe for image size or offsets of various pieces of code).&nbsp; Make sure that after you edit the hex for the right model number that you have the right number of periods/dots/nulls between the two pieces of text.</p>									</div>
