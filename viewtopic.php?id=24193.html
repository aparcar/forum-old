					<p>Hello</p><p>I have t-sinus 154 dsl. I bought it without the sticker on its cover, and I don&#039;t know witch exactly model I have.<br />So I have two problems.<br />One is how to find witch model I have ? When Im logged in I see sign t-sinus 154 dsl (and nothing more), and in software version&nbsp; is 0.81.<br />Second problem is how to choose suitable bin file to load.<br />I found that propably i should use file for ar7&nbsp; <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar7/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar7/</a>&nbsp; but I don&#039;t know whitch bin file to choose.<br />If its not ar7 please correct me.</p><p>And in this I have one more question.<br />Normal version of t-sinus 154 could route between lan and wifi, but now I changed my provider. I have to share iternet signal (from lan cable) to <br />two other comuters connected (with normal lan cable) to t-sinus. Wifi is not used (in fact wifi card is not working).<br />In oryginal software there was no way to route between rj45s. <br />At the back of device I have four lan ports and one dls. <br />Those lan ports work as an switch (one interface and one mac) or four interfaces ?<br />I am wondering is it posiible to do routing on one interface, I could do aliases but all of them will have the same mac address.</p><p>EDIT:<br />Ok. I found that I have normal sinus 154 dsl on ARM processor.<br />It might be a problem with routing (if there is one lan interface) but I can try on aliases, if not work i can try with vlans and it should work.<br />Now I need help with choosing right bin file to load to device.</p><p>I found my device in table of hardware (the second one on the list)<br /><a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/Hardware%282f%29TCom.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/Hardware%282f%29TCom.html</a> <br />but I stil dont know how to find right bin file in download section.<br />I need a manual or something like that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bullet_0</strong> on 9 Apr 2010, 20:31)</p>
