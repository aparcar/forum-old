					<p>Greetings.</p><p>I work for a company that wants to add a wireless control feature to their product in a short time frame.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a &quot;module&quot; that run OpenWRT and has a hardware I2C controller (I&#039;d rather not use i2c-gpio-custom).&nbsp; I notice that Ralink/Mediatek chips seem to have i2c controllers .</p><p>I like the Atheros / Qualcomm AR9331 modules, but they don&#039;t seem to have a hardware I2C controller.&nbsp; I see announcements from Qualcomm about a QCA4531 module (with hardware I2c ? ), but don&#039;t see where to buy an eval module.</p><p>There seem to be a few modules in the OpenWRT build tree, such as Vocore , RT5350F-OLinuXino , WRTnode &amp; &quot;MicroWRT Core&quot;.&nbsp; I also see &quot;NixCore X1&quot;, that seems to run OpenWRT “Chaos Calmer”.&nbsp; Also &quot;LinkIt Smart 7688&quot;.</p><p>Do you have opinions / experience with any of these modules / chipsets ? How robust is the WiFi &amp; I2C ? How reliable / quick is the vendor to provide samples , production runs&nbsp; and support ?</p><p>Can you recommend any other modules (w/ hardware I2C) ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
