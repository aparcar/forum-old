					<p>Dear list,</p><p>Simulating an AP in a Windows environment proofed impossible as I tried so many (free) software packages promising to share my internet connection with multiple clients...</p><p>At some point, I hit this blog entry:<br /><a href="http://macbruins.com/category/linux/openwrt-linux/">http://macbruins.com/category/linux/openwrt-linux/</a></p><p>Perfect! As I have come to understand: hardware virtualization, and USB redirection into that virtual environment, is the only means to have a WiFi device operate in &#039;infrastructure mode&#039; &quot;under&quot; (but isolated from) Windows. Well.. Good luck with it!</p><p>With all respect, I found support for USB WiFi hardware by OpenWRT poorly documented -- that is: which hardware, **currently available in (web)shops**, can be used? Hard question to answer by Googling.</p><p>After a first failure (D-Link DWA 160, not supported / dectected by OpenWRT), the next was a hit: Conceptronic C300RU. It was only after unwrapping the packaging that I found out I was shipped version 3. It is not listed on Linux Wireless, but works fine. Well... Almost. I got some driver error, suggesting the invocation of unsupported functions on the driver when operating in the 11ng hardware mode (11b worked fine, but is rather slow)</p><p>It was by this forum post:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27226">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27226</a><br />that I ended up replacing the rt2870.bin, downloading the latest version from:<br /><a href="http://www.ralinktech.com">http://www.ralinktech.com</a></p><p>Virtualising a Wireless Access Point comes in handy in situations where you don&#039;t have a power grid available. Archaeological fieldwork is one of many examples of this type of working environment. Yet, using OpenWRT + VMWare + a Wifi USB dongle makes connecting more-than-two devices possible.</p><p>Now, that&#039;s what I call Wireless Freedom. Thank you guys.</p>									</div>
