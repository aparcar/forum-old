					<p>I&#039;m observing similar memory leaks on an Asus WL500g Premium, with Kamikaze 7.09. I suspect that this might be related to the following problem: when I connect to the wireless network of the router from my Windows XP laptop, using either WPA or WPA2, everything seems fine for the first time. The wireless client reports a signal strength of Excellent and a speed of 54 Mbps. From this point the speed starts dropping till 1 Mbps, with a constant signal strength of Excellent or Very good. When 1 Mbps is reached reauthentication occurs and a new DHCP request is also issued. The reauthentications occur with such frequency so that the wireless network is rendered completely useless. It seems that every reauthentication sends a wl0: invalid argument to the console. The same story can be observed on other clients as well. Has anybody seen and been able to solve such a problem? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>if you bring down the interface and then back up, does the memory get restored?&nbsp; If yes then this may be a temp workaround to this serious problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your answer! The memory, or at least a great chunk of it, seems to get restored - however, the reauthentications remain. I have tested with WPA{1|2}/{Enterprise|PSK} (all combinations, that is), but no joy. I&#039;ve already found a dev ticket discussing similar issues, but nothing useful for me so far. Luckily, I only have to resort to wifi about once in a leap year, but still...<br />EDIT: I&#039;ve just read this thread: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14540">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14540</a> I also seem to have a high Tx excessive retries number (3235) while Rx invalid is 0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>neutron</strong> on 5 Apr 2008, 20:38)</p>
