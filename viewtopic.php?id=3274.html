					<p>When I first got my router and loaded OpenWrt on it the first package that I installed was iftop.&nbsp; I was new (newer) at this then and was just fooling around looking at the various packages.&nbsp; I wound up re-flashing OpwnWrt after I had severely borked it, losing iftop and a few other nifty packages.&nbsp; I just tried to re-load iftop and the installation goes without errors.&nbsp; However, when I try and execute the program I get the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ iftop
interface: br0
IP address is: 192.168.1.1
MAC address is: 00:13:10:xx:xx:xx (edited)
Open RING [fd=-1]
Error opening terminal: xterm.</code></pre></div><p>Any idea?&nbsp; I have tried to remove the package and all its dependencies but still get the error.</p><p>Thank you,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Duffin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Duffin444</strong> on 15 Nov 2005, 06:57)</p>
