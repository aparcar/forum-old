					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m using openwrt for quite some years and in order to take most benefit of it, I&#039;m using the root file system on an USB stick (my routers are tp-1043nd&#039;s).</p><p>I have loads of logging (lots of foregin port scans, etc.) constantly being written, which means that from time to time, the USB stick gets damaged for so much use (wearing) and needs to be replaced. </p><p>In the past, I tried to implement a <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50572">OpenWrt RAID1 solution </a> (two USB sticks in mirror), where I could replace a damaged USB stick without loosing the information (and with no downtime), but had no success...</p><p>Recently in another personal project I implemented a DIY NAS based on <a href="http://www.openmediavault.org">OpenMediaVault</a> (OMV). I&#039;m using an old PC and the NAS OS is running on an USB stick as well. However, OMV seem to be sensitive to the USB wearing issue and use a plugin called &quot;OpenMediaVault flashmemory&quot; (AKA Folder2RAM), which I believe it creates some virtual folders in the device&#039;s RAM in order to avoid excessive writing on the USB stick.</p><p>I realised that a similar solution would also be useful for OpenWRT, although I know that typically OpenWrt&#039;s Router RAM is much more humble than a PC (even though old). </p><p>I imagine lots of OpenWRT users also use a USB stick in their routers and would also have similar problems and would therefore be interested in something like that.</p><p>Would it be easy to somehow port this functionality to OpenWRT? Would it make sense? I mean, how many people would actually benefit from it?</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Jabss</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you v10lator, I will check that out.</p><p>For the record, this is what I did to reduce flash wear on a battery-backed TP-LINK MR3040.</p><p>I booted into a Linux recovery CD, and used GParted to create a partition table on /dev/sdb (the card), with two MiB-aligned entries: a 500 MB swap, and a non-formatted one using the remaining space. Then I opened a terminal and ran the following commands.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># mkfs.ext4 -O ^has_journal /dev/sdb2
# tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback /dev/sdb2
# e2fsck -f /dev/sdb2
# dumpe2fs /dev/sdb2 | grep features</code></pre></div><p>This creates an ext4 file system on the second partition, with no journal. You can check the absence of &quot;has_journal&quot; in the last command&#039;s output to make sure everything went okay. Some people go the extra mile and tweak RAID stripe options to align clusters with erase block sizes, which provides extra performance at no cost, but I haven&#039;t tried that yet.</p><p>In OpenWRT, I added the following mount options to my fstab. <em>noatime</em> implies <em>nodiratime</em>, so you don&#039;t need to add them both.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>async,commit=30,noatime,data=writeback,barrier=0,nobh</code></pre></div><p>These give the best performance, at the cost of greatest data loss should there be a power failure (but with a 2000 mAh battery, you&#039;d need a ~4 hour blackout for that). Whenever I need to turn the router off, I SSH into it, stop all processes writing to disk, sync and only then flip the power switch. The rOOter firmware has a &quot;Power Off&quot; page in LuCI; it&#039;d be nice to see how they did it and if it can be turned into a package.</p><p>More ideas:<br /></p><ul><li><p>jabss could compress his logs by piping them through gzip.</p></li><li><p>tweak the swappiness value if you also use a swap partition, I set mine to 10.</p></li></ul><p>Furthermore, you can change the I/O scheduler to noop to avoid wasting CPU time in reordering requests, which has no benefit on USB thumb drives or memory cards. Ideally, this should be done by adding <em>elevator=noop</em> to your kernel parameters, but on OpenWRT that requires recompiling the image, which some may not be able or willing to do. A workaround is adding the following at the top of your /etc/rc.local.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sync
echo noop &gt; /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
# Add lines for sdb, sdc, ... if you have them</code></pre></div>									</div>

For a first step follow the links in my previous post, they&#039;ll give you a great starting point (this f2fs kernel module was also my first &quot;contribution&quot; to OpenWrt).

Ofc. my &quot;porting&quot; of the poweroff luci app was there, too (I&#039;m trying to adapt it more to OpenWrt by making it just like the reboot app is done). So now I&#039;m sad + don&#039;t know what to run as extroot: f2fs won&#039;t run for long with just 32 MB RAM (OOM kills even when there&#039;s much swap free) and your tuned ext4 is a data bomb.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>v10lator</strong> on 2 Apr 2016, 10:15)</p>

					<p>Didn&#039;t notice your edit until now! Thanks for the luci-app-systemstop package.</p><p>Also, sorry to hear about your data loss. I&#039;ve been running extroot on the same USB stick for some months now, without any problems (always taking care to sync before rebooting or shutting down as I mentioned). To my credit, I did warn that these are &quot;extreme&quot; settings that were being used with a battery backup...</p>									</div>
