					<p>Hello</p><p>I&#039;m testing a router based on the BCM5356 chip, and it is based on TomatoUSB. It has 32MB RAM and 8MB Flash. Is this chip supported by OpenWRT?&nbsp; I found some discussions about the Asus RTN10 and RTN12, using similar chips, so the target that should be considered is the brcm47xx, but I didn&#039;t find any post about it is really working (at least the ethernet interface). In this thread (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10987">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10987</a>) it seems that the router boots but the ethernet dooesn&#039;t show any packets, but in the last post says that the current trunk has some changes, including a new switch driver, but it seems that there are no test results yet. I have been using OpenWRT with Atheros chips and I&#039;ll prefer to have a solution based on it instead of Tomato.</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Fernando</p>									</div>

					<p>There is some problem with network/switch driver affecting some GBit MAC/BCM5325 devices. For example network doesn&#039;t work on my Linksys E900. It doesn&#039;t matter if I use old (switch) or new (b53) switch driver.</p><p>This issue is coming to the top of TODO list, but I still have to take a look at different bgmac issue (performance).</p><p>You can ping me in a ~2 weeks for update.</p>									</div>
