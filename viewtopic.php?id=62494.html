					<p>I was wanting to setup the device as RoutedAP instead of BridgedAP. Under the interfaces page I unchecked &quot;creates bridge over specified interface&quot; under LAN1 and then clicked &quot;Save &amp; Apply&quot; accidentally before finishing the other necessary parts.</p><p>It is now not possible to access the router.</p><p>After a normal boot the ESSID is visible and if I statically assign an IP I can associate to the AP, but the device does not have DHCP configured and is not forwarding to the standard network and has no IP itself AFAIK.</p><p>Attempting to put the devcie into failsafe mode appears to work, but I cannot communiate with it. I see the broadcast go out to 192.168.1.255 port 4919 saying to press the button, which I do, and then the router light blinks very rapidly. However, I cannot reach the device via 192.168.1.1/24. I have my system configured manually as 192.168.1.2/24 and have also added a second device (192.168.1.3) on a local switch just as a sanity check. Both of the other devices can communicate just fine.</p><p>The device is running openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-wmr-300-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin with few changes. I have uploaded an ssh key, changed the default ssh port, and renamed the ESSID only.</p><p>What would be the best next steps to recover the router?</p><p>Thank you for any assistance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to fix this problem by re-flashing using a tftp server, as done in the initial setup on these devices.</p><p>NOTE: This must be done with firmware compiled with *ramdisk* rather than SquashFS.
