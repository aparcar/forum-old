					<p>Dear experts,</p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWRT for years and try to migrate from Attitude Adjustment to Chaos Calmer. After the first try was greatly failing, I setup from scratch in a test environment. However, there seems to be sometjing wrong with the zone_wan_prerouting rules.</p><p>Setup: WAN, LAN, DMZ</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;dmz&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth0.100&#039;
        option ipaddr &#039;192.168.100.1&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>For testing haproxy statistic interface is bount to 192.168.100.1:8888<br />Checked with lsof.</p><p>Port forwarding rule:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect
        option target &#039;DNAT&#039;
        option src &#039;wan&#039;
        option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
        option dest_port &#039;8888&#039;
        option dest &#039;dmz&#039;
        option dest_ip &#039;192.168.100.1&#039;
        option name &#039;test port forward dmz&#039;
        option src_dport &#039;4488&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Resulting ipfilter rule (iptables-save)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>A zone_wan_prerouting -p tcp -m tcp --dport 4488 -m comment --comment &quot;test port forward dmz&quot; -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8888</code></pre></div><p>Same setup in attitude adjustment for port 443:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>A zone_wan_prerouting -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.5.1:443</code></pre></div><p>So somethings goes really wrong in chaos calmer! There is no destination IP in the prerouting rule specified in the port forwarding ...</p><p>Or did I miss something, even debugging for days?</p><p>Any help would be appreciated? </p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Suggestion:</p><p>If you want to enable external access to some service that is hosted in the router, configure the server to listen on 0.0.0.0 (any interface) and use Open Ports on Router instead of port forwarding to the router itself.</p>									</div>
