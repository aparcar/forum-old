					<p>Hello! yes, it is a bit dead but just a few days ago came to my hands a nice thomson tg585v7, i would like to use it as a router on my network so don&#039;t really care about the dsl, however I would like to use wifi. Is there anything new on wifi? Could someone help to make it work with closed drivers and an older kernel? As i saw it could be able to work with kernel 2.6.8.1, so could i flash it (using jtag, as i suppose there is not other solution on that),&nbsp; using this kernel and having the ability to use adsl and wifi too ?..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cshark</strong> on 7 Dec 2011, 11:40)</p>
