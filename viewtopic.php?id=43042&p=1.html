					<p>to really comment if the driver for the flash is missing, we would need the bootlog. another reason for not being able to mount the rootfs is that openwrt uses a different partition layout than the original firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Going to old kernels is barking up the wrong tree, in my opinion.&nbsp; &nbsp;the move to 3.x kernels wasn&#039;t even a big change it was just the whole Chrome version numbering system (which 15 years ago happened with Solaris) also apparently Linus&#039; mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because bigger numbers are impressive, apparently.</p><p>Also, if you have one of these you should take it apart and&nbsp; take pictures and put them on the wiki.&nbsp; </p><p>The flashing the rootfs route is HIGHLY unlikely to work because you&#039;d have to build matching kernel modules for that particular kernel. bleh.</p><p>I&#039;m still not 100% on all the different moving parts that it takes to get openwrt support going, but they have (some of) the code available for this thing at <a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2649">http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2649</a> </p><p>For the life of me i don&#039;t understand why they pack it the way they do ...&nbsp; (are they trying to defeat search engines or something ? ) </p><p>it&#039;s tar -&gt; tar -&gt; bzip2 -&gt; zip&nbsp; &nbsp; i thought it was some sort of error... but once you get it open the README.txt actually does have that in it:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Unpack the open source distribution into a separate directory using the<br />follwoing command:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ unzip wndap360_v&lt;version&gt;_ww_src.tar.bz2.zip<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ tar xvjf wndap360_v&lt;version&gt;_ww_src.tar.bz2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ tar xvf wndap360_v&lt;version&gt;_ww_src.tar</p></blockquote></div><p>To my eye it doesn&#039;t look TOO much is patched.&nbsp; i.e. nothing that adds whole drivers (though i could just be missing it).</p><p>BTW, i think this thread actually belong in&nbsp; the Dev section.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hardware Hacking&quot; is, i think , for people cutting things and soldering things.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My impression is that the dev forum gets a bit more traffic too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for a lot of information.<br />In terms of flashing rootfs only I am aware that I need modules from old rootFS but this isn&#039;t too much of a problem really, I can just replace original and than flash that in.<br />I will have a look at netgear original firmware, this is good path <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />As I said tomorrow, I will post more output here with details of problem.</p><p>In terms of going for old kernel... well tbh anything will be better than original firmware, and I mean anything.

I found this guy with identical problem: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15423264/ping-100-packet-loss-under-openwrt-driver-relevant-issue"> LINK TO THREAD</a> but there isn&#039;t solution... any help on this? I am not sure where to start... I can provide all logs if needed.</p><p>Other than this, flash, radio etc all seem to work, so I feel only this left.</p><p>btw if ANYONE owns WNDR3700 -&gt; could you connect a network cable to a WAN port with 1000meg speed and do dmesg | grep pll ? it has same SOC with same clock so pll value from it should work for me too...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jaceq</strong> on 2 Apr 2013, 18:05)</p>

					<p>So I managed to fix this!<br />This was due to wrong pll setting, my build was using default setting(from AP96), I noticed that wndr3700 (same CPU / same clock) had a different pll setting for eth0, so I decided to do things properly and rather than hacking I added proper support for my AP, than in my own new mach file, I used pll setting from wndr3700 and voila! interface works at 1Gbps, no problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I will test things a bit more, and then I will submit the patch.<br />Currently not working things are:<br />Wifi LEDs (didn&#039;t have time for this as this isn&#039;t important for me)<br />/etc/config/network has wan interface defined with eth1 which doesn&#039;t exist on this device<br />sysupgrade doesn&#039;t work (should be pretty easy to add this).</p><p>Other than this device seem to work, trick is that inital flash has to be done via tftp as original software accepts .tar file that has seaprate kernel image and rootfs image in them, and since I had to alter original partition layout (kernel is 1,4megs and original partition for kernel was 1 meg) so flashing in uboot is mandatory to put things in right place.</p><p>Once I will put my patch out in public I will put whole procedure on wiki so others will be able to use this <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jaceq</strong> on 3 Apr 2013, 11:18)</p>

					<p>Update here:<br />I made final modifications and submitted patch we will see how will this go <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />One more interesting this, I managed to screw my ART partition, I was lucky as we have 4 APs like this so I took a copy from other one...<br />But changing a MAC was a must (since I&#039;d have same macs on same network -&gt; not good), it was a hassle but I made it (with fixing check summing etc), also I wrote a manual how to do it and was wondering what&#039;s the best place to put it?<br />Should I put it on wiki page to that access point? This is done on my example but I am pretty sure similarities are major on other routers based on atheros...</p>									</div>

					<p>Good stuff.<br />Not great about the ART partition.&nbsp; I believe it (at least partly) contains per device calibration data.&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually is that something you can verify?&nbsp; &nbsp; If you diff the data from the ART partitions on your devices how different is it ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>So I dumped 3 of them and they do differ in more places than just MAC and checksum... saying that my radios work so I think in the end it&#039;s better to have radios working a bit worse than not working at all...
