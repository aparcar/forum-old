					<p>I had similar situation when support for my Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H was broken in trunk. I was forced to use tftp flash (thankfully it&#039;s easy and does not require additional hardware with WZR-HP-AG300H).</p><p>This being said: are you sure you are doing it right? In my case (on firmware with working failsafe mode) I need to press button repeatedly for a long time (over two minutes) for the thing to react (it reacts somewhat differently in my case: all lights on Ethernet connectors go away for a few seconds and when they are back - and it&#039;s in failsafe mode).</p><p>169.254.*.* means you router does not respond: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address</a> ... This is normal for tftp reflash mode (at least on WZR-HP-AG300H) but is NOT normal for failsafe mode.</p>									</div>
