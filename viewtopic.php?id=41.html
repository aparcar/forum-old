On a debian you have these options:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /etc/init.d/iptables
/etc/init.d/iptables options:
  start|restart|reload|force-reload
     load the &quot;active&quot; ruleset

     save the current ruleset
  load &lt;ruleset&gt;
     load a ruleset
  stop
     load the &quot;inactive&quot; ruleset
  clear
     remove all rules and user-defined chains, set default policy to ACCEPT
  halt
     remove all rules and user-defined chains, set default policy to DROP

Saved rulesets:</code></pre></div><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>... web administration package (anyone want to write one?)</p></blockquote></div><p>IMHO that should be last thing to be added. The basic stuff (e.g. SysV style init scripts) should come first. And in the end a web interface is just a thing of convenience. All the things you can do with it can also be done on the command line. So if there is a more complex issue, one could also write a small HOWTO about which commands one needs to run to get it working, no need for a web interface.</p>									</div>

So long as there is good documentation for dummies, I&#039;ll be happy. A great start would be one explaining all the vlan stuff and how to get the ports to function individually. I&#039;ve read all the posts, and just can&#039;t seem to wrap my brain around the whole vlan setup in this router.</p>									</div>
