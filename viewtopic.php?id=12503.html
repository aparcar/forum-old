					<p>Hi, hope I got the right forum for this 1st post.</p><p>Background: Previuosly I&#039;ve worked with the LinkSys WRTs and used SVEASoft firmware and I&#039;ve watched this forum when time permitted. Given the release of the V5 firmware this option has gone tits up for my next project. (Though I&#039;m still considering the GL option).</p><p>Current Situation: I have a project that requires about 1000 units. The project is more of a routing issue than WiFi and the problem I am having is trying to source cheap hardware. SBCs are just silly money. So I thought a better approach might be to buy COTS hardware and install something like OpenWRT. We essentially just need a linux platform on the cheapest hardware we can source that provides two or more Ethernet interfaces.</p><p>We would disable the WiFi part and then code up our own requirements for the project. Likely 90% of the requirements can be addressed using shell script.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1. Can we take the OpenWRT source, modify it etc and sell on to our customers?</p><p>2. Can someone recommend the cheapest platform that we can buy, rebox and sell on?</p><p>Many thanks for your help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I do think you can modify the OpenWRT source code and sell the binaries that you make. You cannot sell the source code though - it has to be made available under the GPL v2 terms (i.e. at a reasonable price that covers the costs of the infrastructure you need to offer the source code - a download server, or a mail service).</p>									</div>

					<p>Could I politely enquire as to who I might contact regarding offering a contract to get my application developed? (I don&#039;t know the people on this forum enough to make direct contact)</p><p>The project will involve sending AT command over Ethernet to a modem. I need the solution to be able to intelligently route IP packets through a default gateway, if the gateway is not available then the box needs to establish a connection via a 3GPP modem and then route all packets over this connection.</p><p>Specifically I need to know your daily rates (in Euros please), I will provide design documentation and requirements matrix for the project.</p><p>We are based in Ireland, but my Customer is based in London UK. We would need to meet prior to getting a contract agreed, I can travel to the UK without much inconvenience.</p><p>I would expect the project to take about one month to complete.</p><p>The final solution will need to go through type-approval at my Customer&#039;s premisses in London, so likely there will be a little follow on work to achieve this.</p><p>Anybody interested?</p>									</div>
