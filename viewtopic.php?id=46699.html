					<p>Hi all</p><p>I want to redirect my guest user on a guest wifi network using nocatsplash. </p><p>Currently I get an IP (dnsmasq is working as expected), I can ping to several websites. But I see some strange behaviour<br />1. When I surf to <a href="http://www.c2root.be">www.c2root.be</a> it works as expected and lets me run through. <br />2. When I surf to e.g. <a href="http://www.homerecording.be">www.homerecording.be</a> it redirects me to the splash page. <br />3. when I don&#039;t accept and surf to another website, it appears to be stuck???<br />4. When I open a browser (restarted the services) and surf to <a href="https://www.Facebook.com">https://www.Facebook.com</a> it does not redirect and keep waiting for a server reply.</p><p>I have added my /etc/config/firewall<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config defaults

#
# See the bottom of this file for options for logging to syslog.

##### Gateway application settings.
#
# GatewayName -- The name of this gateway, to be optionally displayed
#   on the splash and status pages. Any short string of text will do.
#
GatewayName    Studentmesh Options
##
#
# GatewayMode -- Determines the mode of operation of the gateway. Possible
#   values are:
#   
#   Open    - Simply require a user to view a splash page and accept 
#            a use agreement.
#
# Only Open mode is currently supported.
#
GatewayMode    Open

##
# GatewayLog -- Optional.  If unset, messages will go to STDERR.
# (currently unused!)
#
#GatewayLog    /tmp/nocat.log

##
# LoginTimeout - Number of seconds after a client&#039;s last
#   login/renewal to terminate their connection. Probably
#   don&#039;t want to set this to less than 60 or a lot of 
#   bandwidth is likely to get consumed by the client&#039;s
#   renewal attempts. 
#
# For Open Mode portals, you probably want to comment out
#   the preceding and set LoginTimeout to 
#   something large (like 86400, for one notification
#   per day).
#
LoginTimeout    86400

###### Open Portal settings.
#
##
# HomePage -- The authservice&#039;s notion of a default
#   redirect.
#
HomePage    http://www.c2root.be/

# DocumentRoot -- Where all of the application templates (including
#   SplashForm) are hiding. Can be different from Apache&#039;s DocumentRoot.
#   Defaults to /usr/share/nocat/htdocs via compile-time option.
#
# DocumentRoot    /usr/share/nocat/htdocs    

# SplashForm -- Form displayed to users on capture.
#
SplashForm    splash.html

# SplashURL -- URL to fetch remote splash page from. You must compile
#   with --with-remote-splash for this to work. SplashTimeout specifies
#   the reload period of the remote splash page.
#
# SplashURL    http://example.com/get_splash_page.cgi?node=$NodeID
# 
# SplashTimeout    21600

###### Active/Passive Portal settings. 
# None of these settings affect open mode operation.
#
# TrustedGroups - A list of groups registered with the auth server
#   that a user may claim membership in order to gain Member-class
#   access through this portal. The default magic value &quot;Any&quot; indicates
#   that a member of *any* group is granted member-class access from
#   this gateway. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
#
# TrustedGroups    NoCat NYCWireless PersonalTelco
#
TrustedGroups Any

##
# Owners - Optional.  List all local &quot;owner&quot; class users here, separated 
#   by spaces.  Owners typically get full bandwidth, and unrestricted
#   access to all network resources. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
#
# Owners rob@nocat.net schuyler@nocat.net

##
# AuthServiceAddr - Required, for captive mode. Must be set to the address of
#   your authentication service. You must use an IP address
#   if DNS resolution isn&#039;t available at gateway startup.
#
# AuthServiceAddr 208.201.239.21
#

##
# AuthServiceURL - HTTPS URL to the login script at the authservice. 
#

##
# LogoutURL - HTTP URL to redirect user after logout.
#

##
# PGPKeyPath -- The directory in which PGP keys are stored.
#   NoCat tries to find this in the pgp/ directory above
#   the bin/ parent directory. Set this only if you put it
#   somewhere that NoCat doesn&#039;t expect.
#
# PGPKeyPath    /usr/share/nocat/pgp


### Network Topology
#
# FirewallPath - Where to find the firewall scripts.
#   Defaults to /usr/lib/nocat via compile-time option.
#
# FirewallPath    /usr/lib/nocat

#
# ExternalDevice - Required if and only if NoCatAuth can&#039;t figure it out
#   from looking at your routing tables and picking the interface
#   that carries the default route. Must be set to the interface
#   connected to the Internet. Usually &#039;eth0&#039; or &#039;eth1&#039;
#   under Linux, or maybe even &#039;ppp0&#039; if you&#039;re running
#   PPP or PPPoE.
#
# ExternalDevice    eth0

##
# InternalDevice - Required if and only if your machine has more than two
#   network interfaces. Must be set to the interface connected to your local
#   network, normally your wireless card.
#
InternalDevice    br-guest
##
# LocalNetwork - Required if and only if NoCatSplash can&#039;t figure it out
#   by polling the InternalDevice. Must be set to the network
#   address and net mask of your internal network. You
#   can use the number of bits in the netmask (e.g. /16, /24, etc.)
#   or the full x.x.x.x specification.
#
 LocalNetwork    10.0.0.0/24

##
# DNSAddr - Optional. *If* you choose not to run DNS on your internal network,
#   specify the address(es) of one or more domain name server on the Internet
#   that wireless clients can use to get out. Should be the same DNS that your
#   DHCP server hands out.
#
 DNSAddr 8.8.8.8
##
# AllowedWebHosts - Optional.  List any domains that you would like to
#   allow web access (TCP port 80 and 443) BEFORE logging in (this is the
#   pre-&#039;skip&#039; stage, so be careful about what you allow.)
#
AllowedWebHosts    www.c2root.be www.linux.com

##
# RouteOnly - Required only if you DO NOT want your gateway to act as a NAT. 
#   Uncomment this only if you&#039;re running a strictly routed network, and
#   don&#039;t need the gateway to enable NAT for you.
#
# RouteOnly    1

##
# MembersOnly - Optional.  Uncomment this if you want to disable public
#   access (i.e. unauthenticated &#039;skip&#039; button access).  You&#039;ll also want to
#   point AuthServiceURL somewhere that doesn&#039;t include a skip button (like
#   at your own Auth server.)
#
# MembersOnly    1

##
# IncludePorts - Optional.  Specify TCP ports to allow access to when 
#   public class users login.  All others will be denied.
#
#   For a list of common services and their respective port numbers, see 
#   your /etc/services file. Depending on your firewall, you might even
#   be able to specify said services here, instead of using port numbers.
#
#IncludePorts    80 443

##
# ExcludePorts - Optional.  Specify TCP ports to denied access to when
#   public class users login.  All others will be allowed.
#
#   Note that you should use either IncludePorts or ExcludePorts, but not
#   both.  If neither is specified, access is granted to all ports to
#   public class users.
#
#   You should *always* exclude port 25, unless you want to run an portal
#   for wanton spam sending. Users should have their own way of sending
#   mail. It sucks, but that&#039;s the way it is. Comment this out *only if*
#   you&#039;re using IncludePorts instead.
#
 ExcludePorts 23 25 111
#
#ExcludePorts    25

####### Syslog Options
#
# Log Facility - syslog or internal.  &quot;internal&quot; sends log messages
#    using STDERR. &quot;syslog&quot; sends all messages to the system log.

 LogFacility    syslog
##
# SyslogIdent - The ident of the program that is calling syslog.  This will
#    be prepended to every log entry made by NoCat.  Defaults to NoCat.
#
 SyslogIdent NoCat

###### Other Common Gateway Options. (stuff you probably won&#039;t have to change)
#
# ResetCmd, PermitCmd, DenyCmd -- Shell commands to reset,
#   open and close the firewall. You probably don&#039;t need to
#   change these.
#
# ResetCmd    initialize.fw
# PermitCmd    access.fw permit $MAC $IP $Class 
# DenyCmd    access.fw deny $MAC $IP $Class 

##
# GatewayPort - The TCP port to bind the gateway 
#   service to. 5280 is de-facto standard for NoCatAuth.
#   Change this only if you absolutely need to.
#
# GatewayPort     5280

##
#
# IdleTimeout -- How often to check the ARP cache, in seconds,
#   for expiration of idle clients. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
#
# MaxMissedARP -- How many times a client can be missing from
#   the ARP cache before we assume they&#039;ve gone away, and log them
#   out. Set to 0 to disable logout based on ARP cache expiration.
# 
# MaxMissedARP    2
#
# IdleTimeout   300

					<p>In case some of you might come into the same problem: <br />You can overcome this problem as follows<br />1. use ipset in dnsmasq to add some domains to an allowed_ips set<br />2. mark (using prerouting) all the packages which are running from the guest to this set<br />3. redirect all packages which are not marked.</p><p>Use both https and http on your redirection server as it will redirect port 80 / 443 to the new destination server. </p><p>Compare it to a reversed DMZ system</p>									</div>
