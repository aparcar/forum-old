					<p>Hello,</p><p>I know this isn&#039;t exactly on topic, but I&#039;m not sure where else to post as I can&#039;t find any other posts regarding the dir-510 l.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had this router for a year or so now and I&#039;ve loved it but recently I switched it to the USB modem mode within the web ui and saved the setting. It started to reboot and never came back up... and hasn&#039;t been usable since.&nbsp; I&#039;ve of course tried all the standard reset procedures but nothing seems to work. I can&#039;t seem to get mine into recovery mode as was posted earlier in this thread either.&nbsp; I&#039;ve set a static IP and plugged directly into it and attempted to reset it but I can&#039;t get it to respond to anything.&nbsp; The power light remains orange and nothing ever happens... can&#039;t ping or access the webui to do anything.&nbsp; Is there any way I can reset this/ flash a stock firmware over the ethernet port, or am I going to have to do someting more involved?&nbsp; </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as it seems I&#039;ve somehow bricked the device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aeichberger</strong> on 21 Mar 2017, 20:21)</p>
