					<p>I have this router which was custom flashed and paired with a 4gb usb external root.

If I run `md.b 0x9f020000` by itself it prints something like the first 40 bytes. If I supply a [# of objects] variable in hex it does read more, but how can I tell it to read only the full firmware image and not any further into memory, because I have a feeling if I supply to large of a hex number it will start reading past the firmware into other regions of memory.</p><p>Any help is appreciated!</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Edit:: Would it work if I specified the beginning of the firmware image, and then the total size of the flash memory on the router? Or is the beginning of the firmware image where it boots, not the real beginning of the flash. I am basically only wanting to extract the firmware binary.</p><p>Edit2:: The router seems to be a unmodded mr3020 if it matters. </p><p>I found this on the wiki page</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Bytes transferred = 3932160 (3c0000 hex)

It&#039;s not that the firmware itself is encrypted, but the files on the thumbdrive it came with have encrypted partitions that it mounts at boot.
