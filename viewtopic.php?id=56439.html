					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have a network running OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment at the router with Routed AP configuration, and at the client with Routed Client configuration. The network worked perfectly fine for about 2 weeks. For the past couple of days, there seems to be a problem with port 80 traffic.</p><p>My topology is as follows: </p><p>Internet (Public IP) -------- | Openwrt Routed AP (192.168.1.1) | ------WiFi interface---- | OpenWrt Routed Client (192.168.1.6) | ---- LAN interface </p><p>The problem:<br />- Everything works perfectly fine at the Routed AP. I am able to ping <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, wget <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> just perfectly!<br />- Problem starts at the OpenWrt Routed Client (192.168.1.6). I can do an nslookup <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> . I can ping <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, but wget <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> is the problem.,.. The page takes too much time to load (order of 10-20 seconds).<br />- My wireless link seems to be working fine. I ran iperf server on the AP and an iperf client on the STA, and I get good throughputs... </p><p>Just to repeat myself - the entire setting was working just fine until a day or two. I am using NAT at the Routed AP to translate from 192.168.1.0/24 to the public IP. Could this cause some problem?</p><p>Also, I enabled logging on firewall. It seems like my firewall blocks the first packet during every wget request. Could this be the source of the problem? And if so, how can i fix it? The log for firewall blocking is pasted below.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> Mar 23 19:37:53 OpenWrt kern.warn kernel: [10134.490000] MSSFIX(wan): IN=wlan0 OUT=eth0 MAC=00:30:1a:46:09:53:00:30:1a:46:09:41:08:00 SRC=192.168.1.6 DST=74.125.236.191 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=62 ID=10203 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=32854 DPT=443 WINDOW=29200 RES=0x00 SYN UR </code></pre></div><p>Any help is appreciated!</p><p>Thanks,<br />Gaurang.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gaurangnaik90</strong> on 23 Mar 2015, 21:55)</p>
