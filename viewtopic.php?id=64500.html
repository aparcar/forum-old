					<p>Please check if kernel module is loaded in OpenWrt. By default it isn&#039;t build into OpenWrt official releases AFAIK.<br />With buildroot environment you can easily build your own release that would include all dependencies.</p><p>By the way... what expect do you from that? Higher network throughput or some kind of failover? I think a use case for bonding with such an embedded device are very rare.</p><p>This link was also somehow helpful to me:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34342">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34342</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Juni asked above about the usecase. I am looking into this because right now the ethernet port on my Archer C2600 is my bottleneck. I am seeing ~900Mb from my main PC alone using its mapped drives to my NAS and I have 5 or 6 other wireless devices so my PC is consuming most of the ethernet ports bandwidth. I have an LACP capable switch and would love to put Openwrt with LACP on my Archer C2600. Its a shame TP-Link does not allow this on its firmware.</p>									</div>
