					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have a couple of ZyXEL 2602-D1A routers here. I am hoping to get OpenWRT working on them. They&#039;re pretty nice, AR7 with 32MB flash and 32MB RAM. They also have two voice channels for connecting POTS phones for VOIP, so an asterisk setup could be interesting if I get them working.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;ve run OpenWRT before, but not on AR7 hardware. I&#039;ve heard that OpenWRT has been run on ZyXEL&#039;s 660HW router, but found no information on how. Essentially, my problem is that ZyXEL&#039;s firmware images seem to have an identifying header. I&#039;ve pretty much figured out the variable parts of it, but there&#039;s a two-byte number (probably a checksum of some sort) that I don&#039;t know how to calculate. This precludes ftp/tftp/web firmware uploads. The wiki points to a site describing how to upgrade the firmware through a serial console. I tried that (the 660HW &quot;dangerous-command&quot; password calculator seems to work for this router too), but after sending an OpenWRT image through XModem, I get:</p><p>Total&nbsp; 1468672 bytes received.<br />File signature error!!</p><p>So, BootBase itself seems to also check for this header.</p><p>What I want to know is if anyone here has run OpenWRT on a ZyXEL, and can tell me how to make bootbase play nice. Are there any other methods I could try to get new firmware in there other than building a JTAG cable?</p><p>Of course, any other info (if someone knows how that checksum is calculated, for example) would also be appreciated.</p><p>Cheers,<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Sorry to resurrect an old post, but I&#039;ve been doing some similar stuff to you that I thought you&#039;d like to know about.</p><p>You can find the layout of ZyXEL firmware headers, as well as how to upload a non-firmware image, here:<br /><a href="http://www.ixo.de/info/zyxel_uclinux/">http://www.ixo.de/info/zyxel_uclinux/</a></p><p>(This wasn&#039;t me, but I found it very useful.)</p><p>.. basically, if you upload the boot image directly to the booting address (as displayed by ATSH) using the &#039;ATUP&#039; command, it should bypass the &#039;ATUR&#039; firmware upload mechanism and should just work (hopefully.)</p><p>(The model he&#039;s using is running an ARM chip but the bootloader works the same way as my 2602HWL-61C, here.)</p><p>He also provides some checksum algorithms if you wanted to roll your own firmware, although you have a newer BootBase version so the algorithms it uses may be different.</p><p>Also, I was wondering if I could please ask for some info about the 2602-D1A (all from the debug console):</p><p>- Output of ATSH command<br />- Output of ATMP command<br />- What Wireless chip does it use? Is it still on a MiniPCI daughterboard?</p><p>Thanks heaps!</p><p>- Angus</p>									</div>
