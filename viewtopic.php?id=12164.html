					<p>Hi all,<br />I got a new notebook some weeks ago and I was unable to connect to the wifi network wih the new machine in Windows XP and Linux. The wifi card in the notebook is a Intel 3945 ABG card. Everything with WPA-PSK.<br />In Linux I got always (start wpa_cli):<br />&lt;2&gt;Trying to associate with XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (SSID=&#039;NETWORK&#039; freq=0 MHz)<br />wpa_state=ASSOCIATING<br />&gt; &lt;2&gt;Associated with XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX<br />status<br />bssid=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX<br />ssid=NETWORK<br />pairwise_cipher=CCMP<br />group_cipher=TKIP<br />key_mgmt=WPA2-PSK<br />wpa_state=ASSOCIATED<br />&gt; &lt;2&gt;CTRL-EVENT-DISCONNECTED - Disconnect event - remove keys</p><p>In Windows the Client seems to be associate but no address could be assigned.<br />All other wifi clients are working fine (Atheros and Broadcom cards).</p><p>After weeks of debugging, firmware flashing and tons of google searches I didn&#039;t found any solution. I made bugreports to Intel and the Linux distributor but no solutions.</p><p>Yesterday I found it!<br />I simply disabled (because of problem with another Client with Speedbooster card) the Speedbooster of the WRT54GS:<br />nvram set gmode=1<br />nvram set afterburner=off&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>And the last one was the solution. After restarting the AP my new Intel card connects to the AP and everything is working fine.</p><p>So if you have similar problems with Intel cards, try to disable afterburner. </p><p>I can find a lot of reports with similar problems but this seems to be the first solution for this problem!</p>									</div>
