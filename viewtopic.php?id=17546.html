					<p>Hi,<br />I have the same problem!!! beside, I tried various firmware, even the original updated firmware from Linksys for my WRT54GL. Does anybody know how to come back to a normal firmware? It seems like a bug in the current kamikaze firmware!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>You need a trx image, all other image types are rejected. Which version of Kamikaze is installed right now? The bcm47xx or the brcm-2.4 image?<br />If you installed the brcm-2.4 image, log in with ssh and use the nvram command to set boot wait. </p><p>If you have the brcm47xx variant, flash the Kamikaze brcm-2.4 trx image first, then login after reboot and set boot wait using the nvram command.</p><p>After that you can flash using tftp.</p><p>Another variant to obtain a trx from vendor firmware is to strip the first 32 bytes of the firmware image. This is possibly dangerous and may temporarily brick the device. So only do that if you have no other options.</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>hi</p><p>i found a solution how to flash another firmware. i had the same problem.</p><p>use putty.exe to login to your router.</p><p>then on the command line use following commands.</p><p>nvram set boot_wait=on<br />nvram commit<br />nvram set wait_time=&quot;20&quot;<br />nvram commit</p><p>this will give you enough time to upload the image.</p><p>open up two terminal windows on your client (this is only windows sample should work with any client you just have to adjust tftp and ping commands)<br />this assumes that the router has ip address 192.168.1.1</p><p>in one window you enter </p><p>ping -t -w 10 192.168.1.1</p><p>in the other you prepare your tftp</p><p>tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT &lt;imagename.bin or trx&gt;</p><p>go back to your web interface of the router and reboot</p><p>as soon as there is no more ping being returned by the router hit enter in the second terminal window and upload the image.</p><p>worked for me.</p><p>cheers</p><p>ced</p>									</div>
