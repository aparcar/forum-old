					<p>I was searching forum for info about Huawei HG255d router, and from what I have read so far I concluded this:<br />- there is fully functional OpenWrt supprt from this router<br />- it comes with OpenWrt but a really old version<br />- it includes closed source blobs for wifi drivers<br />- there is no was to build current trunk image what would work on this router</p><p>Are these conclusions correct? If not please correct them.

I searched before asking and this was only active thread where HG255d was mentioned. So there is no other active thread. This thread is generally speaking about many chinese routers that are sold on alibaba and ebay, so I don&#039;t see why are you trying to exclude HG255d from this discussion?!?</p>									</div>
