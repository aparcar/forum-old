					<p>I want to configure double tagged for my router. For example, eth0.1.100, <br />vlan 100 is to distinguish different service like web access or voip and vlan 1<br />is to dispart WAN interface from LAN interface on switch.<br />My question is how to configure double tagged for interface and do openwrt<br />support double tagging?</p><p>Any help will appreciate.</p>									</div>

					<p>Standard 802.1q VLAN tagging does not support double tagging. There is a standard for service providers offering Ethernet WAN connections called 802.1ad which supports double tagging &quot;Q-in-Q&quot; but that is a bit of a special case and I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s supported by most (any?) of the OpenWRT switch architecture.</p><p>I think you might want to try re-phrasing your question by describing more clearly what you are trying to achieve because it sounds to me like you simply want more VLANs and they don&#039;t have to be double tagged for any reason.</p>									</div>

					<p>First, I do not see a vlan 100 in you configuration at all. I only see a VLAN 1, VLAN 2 and VLAN 1001.</p><p>Second, VLAN 1001 is untagged on port 0 but you already have VLAN 1 untagged on port 0. You can only have one untagged VLAN per port.</p><p>Describe what you are trying to DO with VLAN 1001. What kind of traffic it will carry from where to where, how it will be firewalled etc. How do you want VLAN 1001 to be different from VLAN 1 and VLAN 2?</p>									</div>
