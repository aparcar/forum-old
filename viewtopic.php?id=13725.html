					<p>I&#039;m trying to debug an AR7 kernel on a DG834G with a very recent trunk build. I&#039;ve enabled remote debugging via:</p><p><strong>make kernel_menuconfig: &quot;kernel hacking&quot; --&gt; &quot;Remote GDB kernel debugging&quot;</strong></p><p>I&#039;ve also modified to the kernel boot cmdline and appended &quot;nokgdb&quot;. In this way the debug kernel will boot normally, but if I want to debug it, I can pass a cmdline to the kernel from the ADAM2 serial interface via the &quot;go&quot; command that does not have this option.</p><p>Using the cross compiled gdb build within openwrt&#039;s tool chain, I can connect to the kernel:</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code> 

$ cat gdb_commands.bat
shell echo -e &quot;\003&quot; &gt; /dev/ttyUSB0
set remotebaud 115200
set remotebreak on
target remote /dev/ttyUSB0

$ gdb --command=gdb_commands.bat ./vmlinux</code></pre></div><p>This is all fine and good... things work well up to this point. The problem occurs when I try to stop kernel execution using cntrl-c:&nbsp; (ignore the No such file or directory, I was running gdb on another machine with only vmlinux present, the rest of the source tree was not)</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>
