					<p>Hello! I have successfully installed openwrt as a kvm guest using the excellent guide found here. Now that I got a working network around the openwrt router, is there a way I can use a pci wireless adapter on the host machine solely for the kvm guest as the wlan interface. I have searched so many places but I guess some users can get a wireless card to work on a kvm guest as a wlan adapter but I&#039;m looking to use the wifi card to make my openwrt a wireless router. Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want a practical, reasonable answer, it would be a firm &quot;no&quot;. An easier approach would be to just add a <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">dumbap</a> using a hardware router/ AP to the mix.</p><p>For a theoretical answer, involving lots of pain and very special preparations and hardware, there is an option to pass through PCIe devices via VT-d (needs a CPU and mainboard/ BIOS explicitly supporting this) to kvm guests (this is not an really option for USB devices).</p>									</div>

It looks like I have a board and cpu that supports vt-d. Among the additional requirements necessary to perform a PCIe pass through to kvm guest, I&#039;ll also need to enable iommu. I can&#039;t seem to identify that anywhere in the chipset settings. Would iommu just be an alternative to vt-d?

					<p>Or could I setup hostapd on the host machine and have it somehow bridge that device in openwrt?</p>									</div>
