					<p>Hi!!</p><p>I have builded up a trunk image for the Tplink mr3220 with openvpn included by default. That has resulted in removing some packages from the image for making space. One of the packages I had to remove was dnsmasq.</p><p>The router is working correctly right now and the devices which are connected to the router through the LAN/WIFI interface have internet connection through the 3g modem, but the dns doesn&#039;t work and I don&#039;t know if I can configure it manually or use any trick to get it. I know the devices has internet because I can ping 8.8.8.8 but I can not ping google.es for example. </p><p>Thanks!!</p>									</div>

What happens if you configure your clients to directly use 8.8.8.8 as their DNS server?<br />I could be wrong, but think that dnsmasq is actually the part responsible of distributing the router&#039;s DNS server (either configured locally or passed in from the router&#039;s upstream) to the clients connected to the router, so without dnsmasq that exact service is missing. Have a look at <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html</a> where it states:<br />&quot;The DNS subsystem [of dnsmasq] provides a local DNS server for the network, with forwarding of all query types to upstream recursive DNS servers and cacheing of common record types (A, AAAA, CNAME and PTR, also DNSKEY and DS when DNSSEC is enabled).&quot;</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Now I understand how dnsmasq works. I am going to try to include it in the image.</p>									</div>
