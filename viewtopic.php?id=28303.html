					<p>I recently switched over from buggy dd-wrt to openwrt on my buffalo wzr-hp-g300nh. <br />All was going fine as I was tweaking the settings and getting familliar with luci when I changed a setting in the network protocol section i think it was from static to dhcp. <br />Anyway, the router has not worked since then. I have reset 30-30-30 and I can access cli from telnet but I cannot access from ssh after using passwd command. Half the time I get a read only error on changing pswd, the other half goes through but I get connection refused by ssh client. I get what seems to be a normal response from www/cgi-bin/luci command from cli but cannot get GUI from browser. I have tried every way I could find to reload backfire rc4 but after a week at this I&#039;m losing hope I can do thus in my own. I have tried tftp for hours as well. I have been trying to find a cli command to restore default values but no joy there either. </p><p>I need help. <br />Thanks for any advise you can offer. <br />Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>30-30-30 reset does not help, as Openwrt does not store settings in NVRAM as variables. Instead they are in config files in the Linux filesystem.</p><p>Have you tried /sbin/firstboot ? It should reset the settings be removing the writable file partition. (Never tested it myself, though...)</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/preinit_mount?#first.boot">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/pre … first.boot</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/troubleshooting?#what.should.i.do.in.failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt … lsafe.mode</a></p><p>Alternatively, as you have console access, you might edit the /etc/config/network file with &#039;vi&#039;.

					<p>Like hnyman said, if you have console access you can run /sbin/firstboot to wipe out your jffs2 partition and restore default settings.&nbsp; Also, you can reflash the firmware from CLI using mtd or sysupgrade.&nbsp; Use wget to fetch the binary image from the web to your /tmp folder, then sysupgrade -n /tmp/&lt;imagefile&gt;.</p>									</div>

So, most likely you will need to edit config files manually also later. As &#039;vi&#039; is somewhat difficult to use, I suggest that you install the &#039;nano&#039; editor module to make text editing easier.</p><p>...and remember to take backup copies of the config files regularly.
