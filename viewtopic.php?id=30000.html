					<p>Hey there,</p><p>I have been running an IPv6 tunnel from SixXS for quite some time now mainly for experimenting with the new protocol. While I was setting everthing up, I searched the OpenWrt Forums and numerous other forums for some nice IPv6 firewall configurations I could build on my own settings.</p><p>So I&#039;d like to use this thread to give and seek for best practices on IPv6 firewall configurations and to discuss eventual flaws in posted configurations, to make them solid.</p><p>The following code block contains my current configuration. It&#039;s still a simple shell script but it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to port it into a nice UCI configuration file.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/ash

# Only edit these in case something has changed and if you know
# what you are doing.

#         IPv6 connectivity are connected

# some kind of special configuration, like port forwarding.

# have been properly set.

					<p>The ip6tables config depends quite a lot from the Openwrt version you are running:</p><p>The current Backfire and Attitude Adjustment trunk versions have a dual-stack firewall, where your &quot;default rules&quot; are pretty much built-in and configurable from Luci interface, if necessary. So, you have unnecessary rules in the config, if you target running on current Backfire or Attitude Adjustment trunk. </p><p>Your default rules were needed for &quot;firewall v1&quot; used in Backfire until February 2011 (before r25353) and for running ancient releases like Whiterussian.</p><p>The &quot;custom rules&quot; are still needed even with the current versions for opening selected ports for forwarding.</p><p>Some pointers to earlier discussion on IPv6 firewall rules:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6#protect.your.lan.with.ip6tables">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6# … .ip6tables</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27541</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=127621#p127621">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 21#p127621</a></p>									</div>
