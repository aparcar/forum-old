					<p>I have openwrt working when I open up an ssh session to my router and manually run openvpn from the ssh/bash command prompt.&nbsp; I&#039;m running it in bridge mode. I can connect from my client and ping lan addresses.</p><p>So removed the &quot;#&quot; in column one that I had inserted earlier in /etc/init.d/S60openvpn so it would start in deamon mode with the following command. Here is the original command the ipkg installation put in /etc/init.d/S60openvpn:</p><p>openvpn --daemon --config /etc/openvpn/wlan_home.conf</p><p>The installation procedure created this file, (I did not), so I assume the syntax is correct.</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Siegfried</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh my, I must remember to proof read my postings. The title should read &quot;openvpn works from ssh session, but not as deamon&quot;. Sorry.<br />When I use reboot with the &quot;open --daemon --config /etc/openvpn/wlan_home.conf&quot; inside the /etc/init.d/S60openvpn file, I cannot connect.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Siegfried</p>									</div>
