					<p>Dear developers!</p><p>I am not sure whether this qualifies as a developer question, but I am pretty sure OpenWRT developers can answer it. I&#039;d like to know whether it is possible to capture TCP packets and hold them back for a while on the router? I want a computer on the LAN to sleep by longer inactivity and I&#039;d like to wake it up with WOL from the router, when TCP packets addressed to it arrive. Is this possible with a shell script? Is there any API to help in this? Is there any possible workaround you can think of if not?</p><p>Note that Apple routers support a similar feature: &quot;Wake on Demand and Bonjour Sleep Proxy&quot;, but I&#039;d like to buy a Linksys WRT1200AC and use it with OpenWRT if it is possible somehow to solve this.</p><p>Many thanks!<br />inf3rno</p>									</div>
