					<p>Hi, i&#039;d like to piggyback on this thread with a question about static route..<br />(btw I&#039;m, also running CC RC2 but on a Xiaomi miwfi mini)</p><p>in a nutshell: <br />-in switch config i connected all ports to eth0.1 (and deleted the eth0.2 config)<br />-set the LAN interface to a static IP, and created a bridge with the wlan.(deleted the WAN/WAN6 interfaces)</p><p>AP-wise everything is fine, yet OpenWRT itself cannot access the internet, but it can connect to other devices on the LAN.<br />to solve this i had to add a static route to the gateway.</p><p>my question is *why* that route needs to be added *manually*<br />- ie the LAN interface settings are configured with a netmask and gateway, shouldn&#039;t that be sufficient?</p><p>tnx.jo</p>									</div>
