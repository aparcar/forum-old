					<p>Hi,<br />I need to cover a pretty large area with wifi and I have one 4G connection at one end of this area. I have used Openwrt with sta bridges from the router with 4G and it has been working for a while but after some time it just slows down, probably because there is a lot of users. Too much traffic at the same channel might also be the problem. There can totally be around 50 users at the same time on these 10 routers. The range/coverage seems to be no real problem. I have looked around and I think a mesh would work better than repeater mode. I have read this <a href="http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/Quick-start-guide">http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batma â€¦ tart-guide</a> and even tried some preconfigured Freifunk firmwares but I didn&#039;t really get it to work for me. I need WPA2 encryption and I don&#039;t need any login page. Is there any clear guide for batman-adv or olsr?</p><p>Edit: The routers I have are TP-Link TL-MR3220 V2 and TL-WR841N. Is it possible to use the router also to distribute the wifi signal to clients or would it be better to have a separate router connected through the ethernet port, if I use batman-adv for example?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>monotube</strong> on 7 Jun 2015, 18:10)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve had good success with simply using 802.11s around the house.&nbsp; The advantage is it&#039;s already built into the ath9k wifi driver and most of the others.&nbsp; BATMAN and Freifunkt are kind of a different approach that is optimized for city-wide networks with many more nodes.</p><p>Unfortunately LUCI doesn&#039;t quite know how to configure an 11s mesh point interface so you will have to do it manually in /etc/config/wireless.&nbsp; A basic unencrypted mesh looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-iface
    option device   radio0
    option network  lan
    option mode     mesh
    option mesh_id &#039;mymesh&#039;</code></pre></div><p>It is essential to set all the routers to the same RF channel of course.</p><p>Putting the mesh interface into the lan network makes things work (ideally) as if you had linked all the routers together with ethernet cables between the lan ports.&nbsp; So you want to give each one a unique static IP, and turn off the DHCP servers on all but the one that is connected to the Internet.</p><p>You can make AP interfaces on some or all of them for your users, and/or connect wired devices to the LAN port.&nbsp; Using another router to provide wifi access may reduce congestion on the mesh channel, but unless you get several feet away, two routers on the same band though different channels are likely to jam each other&#039;s reception.</p><p>To encrypt trraffic on your mesh, install the authsae package.&nbsp; This brings in the whole libopenssl library, which is a problem on 4 MB flash routers.&nbsp; Anyway once you get it to fit somehow, configuration is amazingly simple though not easy to find.&nbsp; Add these 2 lines to your interface:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    option encryption &#039;authsae&#039;
    option key &#039;Thisisabigsecret&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Luci will show &#039;disabled or not associated&#039; status for the mesh interface even when things are working perfectly.&nbsp; You can check mesh status with the iw command for example &#039;iw dev wlan0 mpath dump&#039;&nbsp; This will show all the nodes that this node knows about, even if they don&#039;t have a direct path.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 7 Jun 2015, 22:41)</p>
