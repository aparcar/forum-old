					<p>Hi experts,</p><p>I have two TP-Link TL-WR841N v5.1.<br />Before i tried to uploading OpenWrt to them. First tried backfire 10.03, later on 10.03.1, then attitude adjustment 12.09-rc1.<br />All images got installed successful, but i have one big problem with all of them:<br />depending on version the images have no LuCi installed. No Problem so far. Installed it if needed and yeah it works. All the time WLan Interface is off.</p><p>When i now try to setup a wpa2 network and save the changes, success message appears. Now pressing apply changes and enabling the wlan interface brings the router into a reboot loop. Shortly all Lights light up, then the sys led starts blinking (rebooting). At this Point rebooting will fail after some time and jump into next reboot.</p><p>I can access the device when entering the failsafe mode on booting. now i enter firstboot to the console and powercycle the device afterwards. It is now defaulted, but accessible.</p><p>Does anyone have an idea about this?</p><p>Best Regards,<br />redflag237</p>									</div>
