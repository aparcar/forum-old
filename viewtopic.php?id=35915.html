					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I am trying to run nginx 1.0.14-1 on Kamikaze-7.09 (no other Version correctly rebooted) on my NSLU2. Anything looks fine nginx was installed under /opt/sbin the start-script is /opt/etc/init.d/S80nginx my nginx.conf is at /opt/etc/nginx - so far so good.</p><p>But when I try to start nginx like this: /opt/etc/init.d/S80nginx start I get: &quot;/opt/etc/init.d/S80nginx: /opt/etc/init.d/S80nginx: 46: /opt/sbin/nginx: not found&quot;.<br />Using Google I also found this: /opt/sbin/nginx what openwrt responses with not found also.</p><p>I tried to fix it by changing the PATH in S80nginx to PATH=/opt/sbin without success. <br />Now I feel a bit like not to see the wood for the trees, because the same error I have with lighttpd even though /sbin/nginx respectively /sbin/lighttpd definitely exist. </p><p>Could you give me a hand to fix this problem?</p><p>Thanks a lot in Advance</p><p>hcx</p>									</div>
