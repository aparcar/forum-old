					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>i got a problem and thats it. It got a wifi connection with ~30 Mbit sometimes more sometimes less.<br />Now i got the problem that the ubiquiti device makes QoS fine ... no bufferbloat at all becuase the ubiquiti knows his connection speed. Now i must have a router behind this device but there i dont get stable buffers from +500 ms on heavy load.</p><p>Internet &lt;-----&gt; Wifi1 &lt;-----&gt; Wifi2 &lt;----&gt; OpenWRT Router &lt;-----&gt; LAN</p><p>To the Wifi devices i got no access only the OpenWRT device but got voip problems under load ... so i Know about QoS but this does not work because the Wifi2 already does and the OpenWRT dont know the connection speed.</p><p>So is it possible to keep the DSCP header of the packets over the LAN from The OPenWRT to the Wifi ?<br />With that the Wifi2 should work with DSCP headers correctly ?!</p><p>Regards,<br />Snot</p>									</div>
