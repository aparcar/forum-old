					<p>(I&#039;ve also posted this to various OpenWRT lists, sorry about the spam)</p><p>I&#039;ve been struggling to get /overlay to work on x86.&nbsp; I&#039;m using an<br />initramfs filesystem and I want my changes to persist across reboot.<br />For some reason I&#039;ve been completely unable to get /overlay to work.<br />I&#039;ve tried asking here before, I&#039;ve tried asking on the forum, and<br />I&#039;ve tried it myself - all to no avail.</p><p> This post to the forum (from October) is a good summary of what I&#039;m<br />trying to do:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=169868">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=169868</a></p><p> To verify I&#039;ve tried a native ext2 filesystem and bind.&nbsp; I can&#039;t get<br />either to work.&nbsp; I&#039;m offering $500 to someone who can get this<br />configuration to work (bind fs) using openwrt trunk with an initramfs<br />filesystem on x86 as cleanly (/overlay UCI config) as possible.&nbsp; Any<br />changes made to OpenWRT sources (scripts, functions, etc) must be<br />contributed back and accepted into openwrt trunk.&nbsp; Payment to be<br />delivered via PayPal or some other means we can agree upon.</p><p> Any takers?</p>									</div>
