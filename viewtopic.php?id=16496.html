					<p>I have Broadcom and Atheros wifi mini-pci cards in my RB192 (ADM5120). The Atheros 9160 based card works fine with Ath9k, but the kmod-b43 module isn&#039;t listed in Kernel Modules/Wireless (where it&#039;s listed for my WL-500) so the Broadcom card is useless. Is there a reason the kmod-b43 option isn&#039;t listed?</p><p>On a related note, is the madwifi module still required when using the Ath9k module?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Rob</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robrob</strong> on 1 Aug 2008, 23:07)</p>

					<p>I am having issues with trunk and finding kmod-b43 in the menu.&nbsp; I have selected brcm47xx 2.6 target, but kmod-b43 doesn&#039;t show up under kernel drivers/wireless.&nbsp; I modified the brcm47xx makefile to use kernel 2.6.28 kernel.<br />My builds work except b43 doesn&#039;t seem to be on the firmware when i boot.&nbsp; &quot;rmmod b43&quot; &quot;insmod b43&quot; fail.&nbsp; The b43.ko file is in my build tree and i can scp it over and insmod it fine... but why isn&#039;t it appearing in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; nor being built into my .bin file?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if it was this or something else I did, but I edited the .config and added CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-b43=y before running make - and it worked automatically on boot.</p>									</div>
