					<p>It sounds like your VLANs are not set up when the router is booting, so all the ports are on the same subnet.</p><p>Maybe you can put some sort of MAC address filtering on your ADSL modem, or whatever the router is plugged into so that it only allows requests from the router.&nbsp; Otherwise, give the router a fixed IP address and turn off DHCP on the upstream device.</p>									</div>

					<p>All I get in here is an Ethernet port with dynamic IP, so I can&#039;t do any filtering on it without another device.</p><p>I can&#039;t believe this is not a known issue.

					<p>I have never used a WR850g.&nbsp; I was just commenting based on your description of the problem.</p><p>Does the PC automatically get a WAN IP every time the router reboots?&nbsp; Or is it just if you renew the lease on the PC at the same time as the router is rebooting?</p>									</div>

					<p>ASUS WL-500gd models had this problem too, with an older boot loader, which was fixed later. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a problem of OpenWrt.<br />Does this occur when you router runs the original firmware?</p>									</div>

					<p>No, of course the original firmware doesn&#039;t have this issue, only with OpenWrt I have to renew my IP manually to get Internet working.. </p><p>And BTW the latest Kamikaze doesn&#039;t even recognize wi-fi on wr850g v3..</p>									</div>
