Perhaps you should upgrade to a newer version? Or is this some OEM&#039;s own firmware version that you&#039;re using?</p><p>Also, if you can open an SSH connection to the router, you should post the content of /etc/config/network, /etc/config/firewall, /etc/config/dhcp, /etc/config/wireless, /etc/config/uhttpd and whatever configuration file your VPN is using. This allows us to understand your network topology a bit better.</p>									</div>
