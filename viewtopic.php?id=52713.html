					<p>I bought TP-Link TP-WR703N from China in order to use it with my USB dongle with mobile SiM card (internet) as a wi-fi router. I connected to iP address 192.168.1.1, but there was only chinese menu. I searched internet and found this page: <a href="http://wiki.villagetelco.org/Flashing_the_TL_WR703n_for_the_first_time">http://wiki.villagetelco.org/Flashing_t â€¦ first_time</a> </p><p>I followed instructions for installing VT SECN firmware and istalled file: openwrt-SECN-2_0-GA-01-wr703n-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</p><p>When I tried to connect to default IP address for SECN firmware 10.130.1.20, nothing happens. </p><p>I use PC with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and in my Network menu I get 3 wireless connections:<br />1. TP-LINK_4665CC, which is out of range (this is connection that I used to get to address 192.168.1.1, but now I can not connect to that address anymore, also)<br />2. vt-mesh, which I can not connect to<br />3. VT-SECN-AP, which is password protected and I can not connect to it (I tried default password potato-potato, but it does not work)</p><p>So I&#039;m totally lost...how can I get my wi-fi internet working (mobile usb dongle connected to TP-WR703N)???</p>									</div>
