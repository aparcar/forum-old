					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m developing some code that so far has run on linux, but I&#039;m increasingly finding differences and need to test on the target (a linksys 54g). I have a package that builds into kanikaze and tftps and runs, but it takes ages and is really slowing me up. </p><p>I have tried wgeting the new native module (from build_mipsel) from my dev machine, but even though I delete the old on my linksys, it still seems to run the old even though its definetly overwrittten with the new, as far a I can tell - really wierd - a flash update/squashfs issue?</p><p>What is the best way to do these adhoc runs of modules without going through the whole build/tftp?</p><p>Thanks very much for any tips.</p><p>Regards</p><p>nick</p>									</div>
