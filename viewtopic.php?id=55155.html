					<p>Running BB 14.07 on a TP-Link TL-WDR4300.</p><p>I was able to get the openVPN server working on the router and I successfully connected to the router from my Ubuntu 14.04 PC&nbsp; using these instructions: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a></p><p>My goal is to have a HUB-SPOKE openVPN network.&nbsp; Several sites (clients) will connect to our primary site (server). But, I want to configure a back-door openVPN access to each of the remote sites just in case the primary site goes down. <strong>My goal is to get openVPN running as a client (to the primary site) and a server (to accept connections) on the same router.</strong> However, when I try to configure both the client and server options on the router, I get the following:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Options error: --server-bridge and --client cannot be used together</p></blockquote></div><p>That makes sense but now I am wondering how to configure this. According to the openVPN docs, my desired configuration is possible using two different configuration files and starting two separate daemons.</p><p>Anyone have any experience on how to do this in openWRT?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>amenra</strong> on 15 Jan 2015, 20:36)</p>

					<p>Having two deamons? Dead easy. For each instance create a file in /etc/init.d/ like so:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
START=90
STOP=10
start() {
        echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        /usr/sbin/openvpn --daemon --config /etc/openvpn/openvpn_configuration_file.conf
}
stop() {
        killall openvpn
}
restart() {
        stop
        sleep 3
        start
}</code></pre></div><p>Then plug the OpenVPN-native config file into /etc/openvpn/ and reference it in the file. Afterwards, enable and start the daemon, done.</p><p>(JFTR: stop and restart are useless with this init file because it does not keep track of individual openvpn instances and kills all of them, restarting only itself though. It works for a shutdown but not for controlling single instances in a running system. You&#039;d have to ps / kill PID. I never bothered to correct this because, well, once OpenVPN is started, it runs for just about forever without problems.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 16 Jan 2015, 00:00)</p>
