					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am using TL-WR941ND and want to turn off the antennas in order that the router may not emit radiation. The model does not have a way to switch off the antennas.</p><p>From what I understand, a router with the antennas removed manually will emit more radiation at close range than a router with antennas on, because it seems that the radiation field will be more focused at close range, although it will be weaker at a longer distance.</p><p>If I open the case of the router and cut the wires of the antennas at the places where they are attached to the internal part of the device, will the radiation be totally removed, or will it become stronger (more focused) at close range?</p><p>If new firmware is installed in the router, will it have the option to turn off the radio signal from the antennas?</p>									</div>

					<p>A person who repairs routers once told me that turning off the WiFi prevents any data from being transmitted, whereas the antennas continue emitting radio waves without data.<br />Do you know whether the DD-WRT firmware can disable the radiation completely, or will it only turn of the transmission of data, whereas the antennas will continue emitting radio waves as usual but without data?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Could you please explain what you&#039;re trying to do?<br />If you&#039;re on your way cutting wires to prevent the router from sending, I get the feeling you&#039;re pretty close to wrap yourself in thin foil like Charles „Chuck“ McGill does o_O.</p><p>I have a TP-Link 4900 which is wall mounted 10cm away from the back of a cheap Toshiba flat screen TV. It&#039;s not the wireless broadcast of my router that conflicts with that TV but the CPU. When I get the routers CPU to 100% (a simple bash loop counting to infinity is enough) I see the signal quality meter of the TV decrease to 15% and experience MPEG artefacts all over the place down to completely shutting down the signal and blacking the screen out. When the CPU stops counting, signal quality gets back to previous high value and everything is fine again.</p><p>There&#039;s no difference between attached antennas and detached antennas.</p><p>I ended up wrapping both, the router box as well as the back side of my TV in thin foil. Now everything works like a charm.</p><p>Here&#039;s what the thing looks like:</p><p><a href="https://ibb.co/gKjSca"><span class="postimg"><img src="https://thumb.ibb.co/gKjSca/router_thin_foil.png" alt="https://thumb.ibb.co/gKjSca/router_thin_foil.png" /></span></a></p><p>The thing is: Maybe there are better ways then cutting antenna wires?</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the explanations. I am trying to remove radiation from the router, since some sources say that that it is harmful to be very close to a router all day long.

In other words, the transmitter is on when data is being transferred back and forth. If you&#039;re not transferring data between clients and the wifi router, the transmitter isn&#039;t emitting radiation all the time anyway.</p>									</div>

You can wrap your router in an aluminum thin foil to ground.</p><p>OTOH, I don&#039;t know if the total transmission power from thousands of satellites hovering above the earth with their antennas pointed to earth and millions of radio stations is more of a concern than the power emitted from your WiFi router. In this case, you may also wanna coat your room and/or whole house with a heavy led pain and be sure to ground it too. This way, radiation from any radio sources, including satellites etc., won&#039;t be able to penetrate into your room or whole house, respectively. Please be sure to read all warnings on any led base paints. Failing that, perhaps moving into a cave may be safer!</p><p>BTW, did you also take into consideration that any electrical wiring inside your house also radiates electrical waves that may be harmful to one&#039;s health?</p>									</div>

					<p>All electronic devices apparently emit radiation. But it is so small that there is no concern about that. The reason why some have been concerned about WiFi routers is because they have antennas designed to emit radio waves.</p>									</div>
