					<p>You probably already know this but I think with the MR3020 you may need to hit &quot;tpl&quot; really quickly into the serial at just the right time during boot to get to the UBoot menu.&nbsp; Took me a couple days to figure that out on my WR703N anyway.<br />Kevin</p>									</div>

					<p>Just flashed r31650 again to MR3020 Ver 1.7, still no Ethernet connectivity, link never comes up, tried setting external switch port to 10F, 10h, 100f, 100h etc, the switch says connected but no traffic. WiFi works. I guess Ver 1.7 is different somehow.</p>									</div>
