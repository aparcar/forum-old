					<p>Hello,</p><p>I configured my TP-link wr703n as a client, and yesterday it all worked fine (I was connect to my home wifi network). Today I booted the device up (didn&#039;t change anything to my home router DIR-655, or my Openwrt WR703N router), and now the Wifi can&#039;t get an ip adress and doesn&#039;t find my network at all. <br />Running a scan list other wifi networks around here, but not my own.</p><p>I am using the&nbsp; BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge, r36736).</p><p>This problem was also in the stable version of openwrt. I can&#039;t find any errors in dmesg, or wifi...</p><p>I hope somebody can help me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmz, it looks like that my main router selects the best channel. So today it was on channel 13 (I&#039;m in Europe), and I saw that openwrt can&#039;t select that option. </p><p>I changed the setting in my main router (dir-655) and set auto channel to channel 10. And all works fine.</p>									</div>

					<p>nebbia88, thank you. About two minutes ago I figured it out myself. </p><p>Do you think it is possible to get openwrt working with channel 12 or 13?</p>									</div>
