					<p>Sure it could.&nbsp; NSLU2 runs an IXP 42x processor like several other devices that are being worked on.&nbsp; Personally I don&#039;t think it makes much sense to port OpenWRT as the NSLU2 only has one network interface and there are several popular existing projects (Unslung, OpenSlug, and Debian Slug for example)<br />These projects will probably provide all the functionality you would need, but the NSLU2&#039;s routing potential is limited to the single ethernet port and USB ethernet/wlan dongles, which doesn&#039;t make it an ideal platform for openWRT in my opinion.</p>									</div>

					<p>Also, for star882 I would suggest compiling just once your own firmware in openembedded.

The only caveat is we need to squeeze its firmware to within 2MB. I recently posted this <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=7324">article</a> looking for some helps trying to idenfity which scripts on openwrt package are responsible to generate each firmware packages. This way, I was hoping to be able to add additional scripts, obtained from the <a href="http://www.usr.com/support/gpl/5461_v3.93.35.0.6_rel2.0.tar.gz">GPLed firmware source</a> (please don&#039;t click unless you want to download the 57MB firmware source) of USR5461, to generate the proper openwrt firmware for this router. As you can see, no one seemed to have responded to my post. I am hoping some of you may be able to provide some helps here to get me started.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mind you this is an open forum and everyone is welcome to voice his/her opinions. I never have such an intention of hi-jacking any thread. The OP did mention NAS and I Just jumped in to voice my concerns with other router. How knows we can kill two birds with a single stone and what&#039;s wrong with it. I haven&#039;t violate any OpenWRT forum rules and regulations here. If you don&#039;t like it, you certainly are welcome to pack/leave; however, making such an accusation is certainly not welcome and it violates the open-forum rule here!</p><p>BTW, thank you for pointing out the FAQ.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 14 Sep 2006, 21:14)</p>
