					<p>Kaloz&#039;s build is on 15.05.1 and the latest driver relevant for the 1900 models. He also offers a build for the 3200, but the driver there is a little outdated now as there have been some commits over the past two weeks which he has not added in yet into his releases.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cybrnook2002</strong> on 27 Nov 2016, 19:36)</p>

At first I thought it might be the HDD but SMART + badblock -wsv showed no problems (I still have 1 year left on the warranty). Then I suspected the enclosure but I tried with another enclosure and another drive and the issue persists (Should the kernel only be built with one fs module?). Despite this i went out and bought a new esata cable and formatted the drive in ext4 yet the errors seems to persist, so I am left wondering if maybe the issue is the esata controller on my WRT1900AC or the code in the kernel (any changes made between .32 and .35?)

However my sata drive was being seen by bios as a internal drive (makes sense)<br />4) I continued to boot up my PC and alas journald -rk showed no error (as it initialized the libata and negotiated the speed all at boot along with the other ssd&#039;s and hdd&#039;s). Continued to use the drive with no problem and the error would not show up again until i purposefully unplugged and replugged the esata from the port (all of this on an Arch kernel 4.8) then the error would show up when unplugged and show up again when i replugged but only once per action!!!! I&#039;m assuming the bios is not set so the esata port is hot-swappable or libata is not used to removable sata drives.<br />5) did the same thing on the router and poof the error disappeared from the first 20 seconds on the boot and the drive seems to have initialized correctly. But after the 30 second mark more of the errors showed up culminatting on a negotiation speed of 1.5 Gbps and so far no other error message. <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   31.696706] ata1: exception Emask 0x10 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x100000 action 0x6 frozen
