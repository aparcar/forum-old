					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to boot a device and get a writeable root file system and cannot get it to work successfully.</p><p>Details are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Device is Cavium Octeon III MIPS64</p></li><li><p>I am using a suppled kernel image from Cavium (includes their proprietary drivers etc)</p></li><li><p>OpenWRT: CHAOS CALMER (Bleeding Edge, r46194)</p></li><li><p>I can boot the image ok, and get it running in RAM with tmpfs mounted</p></li><li><p>I have an SD card with a single partition /dev/mmcblk0p1of type EXT4</p></li><li><p>I have a folder named &quot;kernel&quot; on the partition and inside I have placed the supplied &quot;vmlinux&quot; kernel from cavium</p></li><li><p>I have copied all the files required rootfs files for the OpenWRT OS onto the EXT4 partition.</p></li><li><p>When the image boots, I can see it looking for the root partition at /dev/sda2 as I imagine this was configured in the supplied image from Cavium.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Question: </strong>Is it possible to override this as a boot parameter rather than needing to re create the supplied kernel?</p><p>I see the following error on boot up</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Waiting for usb rootfs dev : /dev/sda2 : 0</code></pre></div><p>I am using uboot as the boot loader with the following commands to boot the image</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ext4load mmc 2 $(loadaddr) kernel/vmlinux

					<p>Just follow exactly what the wiki says, IIRC it&#039;s as simple as: create a partition and mount it, tar the root partition and extract it to the mounted partition, make the fstab changes and reboot.</p><p>I just did it a week or two ago but my router is currently soft-bricked, technically the root parttion is still read-only and it&#039;s still squashFS, but the router sees the overlay as the root and whenever changes are made, they exist only on the overlay (if you make a bunch of changes, then shutdown, remove the sdcard/USB drive and boot up, you&#039;ll be left with whatever was done before you created the overlay.) </p><p>Read this if you haven&#039;t already: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot</a></p>									</div>
