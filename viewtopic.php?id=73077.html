					<p>Hi guys, I have a script written a few years back for one of my devices which seems to fail now on the same device. It was to setup a transparent relay from a wireless network to my LAN. I used it in Barrier and Chaos but even if I load up those same firmwares (that I had saved) now the script no longer works and its because the packages can no longer be found.</p><p>My script was originally put together from <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><p>The first few lines in my script are...<br />opkg update<br />opkg install relayd<br />/etc/init.d/relayd enable<br />opkg install luci-proto-relay</p><p>When I run it today on Barrier or Chaos or even LEDE I get errors...<br />...after opkg update....<br />root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install relayd<br />Unknown package &#039;relayd&#039;.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package relayd.</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install luci-proto-relay<br />Unknown package &#039;luci-proto-relay&#039;.<br />Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package luci-proto-relay.</p><p>Why can I no longer find these packages? Is there a new packages URL that I need to add to be able to find them again.</p><p>Similarly I was trying to find wpad and hostapd-utils and I could not find either of them.</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brimur</strong> on 24 Jan 2018, 15:53)</p>
