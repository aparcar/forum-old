					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>i&#039;ve set up IPsec with the files /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.user and tried to follow your IPsec firewall tutorial to archive a Site2Site VPN connection between my OpenWrt Designated Driver 49971 and a Sonicwall and Fritz Box:<br />wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.firewall<br />wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.site2site</p><p>At the moment the IPsec connection is established and my OpenWrt can be pinged from the other site, but from OpenWrt site the other site is unreachable.</p><p>From my understanding there seem to be some errors&nbsp; in the VPN Firewall Script.<br />I tried to start that firewall script manually and it showd mainly errors which i tried to correct as follows:</p><p>1. include . /etc/functions.sh -&gt; should be . /lib/functions.sh as . /etc/functions.sh is not there</p><p>2. take care of the case sensitive tables &quot;input&quot; and &quot;forward&quot;.<br />In the script they are all mentioned in lower case letters, which throwed errors like <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc# iptables -I input -j zone_vpn_gateway
iptables: No chain/target/match by that name.</code></pre></div><p>when &quot;input&quot; is replaced by &quot;INPUT&quot; in the script, the command works.</p><p>sadly I don&#039;t know how to fix the nat related commands in the script:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc# iptables -t nat -F zone_vpn_nat
iptables: No chain/target/match by that name.
root@OpenWrt:/etc# iptables -t NAT -F zone_vpn_nat
iptables v1.4.21: can&#039;t initialize iptables table `NAT&#039;: Table does not exist (do you need to insmod?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
root@OpenWrt:/etc#</code></pre></div><p>What can I do to get the VPN Firewall script in the tutorial fixed and my Site2Site connection working?</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />ND</p>									</div>
