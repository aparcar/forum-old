					<p>Hello,</p><p>Can someone explain to me how to get my UML295 to work in OpenWrt? I have my network cable connected to the Pi so I can manage/make changes from my PC. When I connect the 4G modem, the scrolling text shows the manufacturer and Pantech and the product as Pantech UML295. It also show the serial number.</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWrt and working with the CLI of Linux, but I have no problem following directions. If someone wouldn&#039;t mind helping me out, I would appreciate it.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
