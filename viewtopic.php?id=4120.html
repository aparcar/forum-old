					<p>Okay,<br />I had to get different stuff than reccomended on the serial port how-to page, and some of it is pretty ghetto.&nbsp; The guy at the electronics shop assured me that this will do the job, but I wanted to make sure and ask some questions before starting on it.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to follow the guide found here:</p><p><a href="http://www.rwhitby.net/wrt54gs/serial.html">http://www.rwhitby.net/wrt54gs/serial.html</a></p><br /><p>This is the requirements for the serial port on mod page:</p><p>AD233BK 233A Serial I/O Kit w/CTS-RTS - I don&#039;t have this kit.&nbsp; I do have a chip (A Sipex SP232ACP with numbers 0039 under the name) that the guy said would work, but it only has 8 pins instead of 10.&nbsp; I notice in Ron Whitby&#039;s page, only 8 of the pins are used.&nbsp; Will this thing do what I need?</p><p>Edit:</p><p>Here&#039;s a link to the data sheet for this chip, comparing it to the 10 pin version &quot;I Think.&quot;<br /><a href="http://www.sipex.com/Files/DataSheets/sp232_312a.pdf">http://www.sipex.com/Files/DataSheets/sp232_312a.pdf</a></p><p>Hoping there is a talented electronics someone out there lurking.</p><p>I don&#039;t have the circuit board for it either, but I do have a socket, so I don&#039;t have to solder directly on to the chip&#039;s pins.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me if this chip will do the job it needs to do?&nbsp; What I want most out of this is a console, because my router is bricked and I can&#039;t seem to get it unbricked any other way.</p><p>DSUBPCSF9 9-pin female PC straight connector - I have this<br />IDCMH10 10-pin shrouded male IDC header - I do not have this, I have some ribbon cable, which the guy said I could solder directly to the serial port on the router&#039;s board.&nbsp; Will that be okay?</p><p>IDDC10 10-pin contact female IDC socket - Don&#039;t need this because I don&#039;t have the 10 pin shrouded male IDC header.&nbsp; I do have one of these though.</p><p>POLHDCON6 6-pin header connector <br />PLHDPIN Crimping pins for POLHDCON6 (includes 10 pins) <br />MCCABLE10 10-pin flat ribbon cable (multi-colour) - I have this</p><p>Any suggestions on where to get started?</p><p>Thanks all,<br />Jim</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gdijim</strong> on 17 Jan 2006, 06:53)</p>
