					<p>First time out with this ROM (r42039 on wndrmacv2) for me and it&#039;s looking fine with one exception, so I thought I&#039;d ask here if there&#039;s a known issue before burning too much more time on figuring this out.</p><p>In short, no matter what I do, 5GHz (Atheros AR9220 802.11an (radio1)) never shows up outside of the router (i.e. no SSID). 2.4Ghz (Atheros AR9223 802.11bgn (radio0)) always does. They&#039;re each configured as similarly as possible, and I&#039;ve deleted/recreated many times, as well as trying 5Ghz alone. Specific channels vs auto don&#039;t seem to matter (no other 5Ghz devices in range anyway). It&#039;s enabled in the UI, so this is puzzling.</p><p>The log even shows the wlan1 link &quot;up&quot; just as it does wlan0.</p><p>Edit: I should add that my phone, which is my wifi client, is 5Ghz capable. It uses the Broadcom BCM4330. A tablet that I have also uses that chip. However, a laptop I have uses a Ralink RT2870, which like the Broadcom supports 5Ghz and also can&#039;t see the SSID.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rseiler</strong> on 13 Aug 2014, 10:00)</p>

					<p>@mk13139: may I ask you for a favour: can you prepare one build with unlocked &quot;u-boot&quot; partition?

I&#039;m planning to test <a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod">this u-boot mod</a> on my second router WR841N V8 and writing the bootloader through OpenWRT would be safer than writing it through the serial port.

					<p>You&#039;re not really reverting since you are upgrading! But yes, you can use Luci sysupgrade functionality. I would recommend clearing all settings and reconfiguring though, as many things have changed since 12.09 in terms of config files.</p>									</div>

Unfortunately, sysupgrade doesn&#039;t preserve packages, in part because anything that was dependent on a specific kernel version would break. Hopefully at some point in the future, openwrt can run sysupgrade and update any installed packages in one swift motion. The alternative is to build your own image, either by compiling it or using the image builder, that includes all of the packages you want. A sysupgrade built in this way would not need any reinstallation.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, which one can you suggest to test IPv6 (Dual-Stack), better if it includes PPPoE on the WAN Ethernet interface, and DS-Lite?</p><p>Is this one TP-Link WDR3600 useful?</p><p>Thanks for your time!!!</p>									</div>

Or maybe an installable package and this would be the only package that you would have to manually reinstall after an upgrade? Certainly makes running trunk with frequent updates much nicer.</p>									</div>
