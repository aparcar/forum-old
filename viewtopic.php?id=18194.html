					<p>I&#039;ll be installing Kamikaze 8.09 and Samba on an Asus WL-520gu.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to set the system up as a File and Print server.&nbsp; The print server will be set up first.&nbsp; I&#039;ll set up the file server (USB HD probably).&nbsp; I&#039;ve started searching for tips on installation but I can&#039;t find answers to some questions:</p><p>1. Can I attach a USB hub to the USB port on the Asus?<br />2. If so, do I need special drivers for the hub or will it work &quot;as is&quot;?<br />3. Can I attach a USB Flash drive to the hub for use as swap space for SAMBA?<br />4. If so, what size Flash drive would be ideal?&nbsp; I have a 512MB drive and a 1GB.&nbsp; Are these too small (or overkill)?&nbsp; The drive won&#039;t hold any other data files.<br />5. Given the above configuration, what version of Samba would work best with Kamikaze 8.09?</p><p>Many thanks for your help!</p>									</div>
