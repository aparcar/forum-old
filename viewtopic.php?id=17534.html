					<p>In Spain, it should be very easy to obtain any UK model. Most will have either Texas Instruments or Broadcom inside. If it is sold as a router rather than just a modem, then there should be a way to make it work. Units sold simply as modems usually do not have enough RAM or flash.</p>									</div>

I have the 624t version, and a lot of trouble handle the modem line stable with the actual trunks 13xxx. With 11xxx is was better, but I had also some drops from time to time. AR7 devices do not seem have the best modem build in. I than switched to usr 9107, that one is broadcom based. Rocksolid with my line, but still running on the branded fw.<br />It has a bcm63xxx inside, so should be openwrt capable with the new trunk. Did not tried it yet for myself.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello David,</p><p>sorry I read your question to late. I try also at first wag200g but it was not a good solution. OpenWRT does not work out of the Box, only 4 MB flash and 8 MB RAM. But it works on Telefonica ADSL. Have a look to <a href="http://woytekm.googlepages.com/linksyswag200g-eu">http://woytekm.googlepages.com/linksyswag200g-eu</a></p><p>I believe the best solution for spain is a router with USB but without any DSL modem. For example ASUS WL-500gP or a ALIX Board. This routers can be used with a USB ADSL Modem: Conexant USB with cxacru driver or Speedtouch. Both drivers are working and a firmware package for speedtouch is in the package tree. Only the firmware for the cxacru driver must be installed manually. The configuration is very easy:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;

					<p>The WAG200G works well enough with the woytekm firmware mentioned above. That firmware also adds an SSH daemon, so you can log on to the router directly.</p><p>The big downside to working with the WAG200G that I have found is that the ADAM2 bootloader appears to be crippled. By that I mean that it refuses to be interrupted before booting the kernel, and does not pause to allow upload of a replacement firmware by TFTP.</p><p>My plan at this stage is to get my JTAG cable working, back up the existing bootloader, and then experiment with rebuilding a new bootloader from the sources on Linksys&#039; FTP server, including the TFTP and interrupt capability. After that, it will be a lot more comfortable to experiment with OpenWRT, knowing that it is possible to recover without a 16 hour JTAG session rewriting the entire flash chip.</p>									</div>
