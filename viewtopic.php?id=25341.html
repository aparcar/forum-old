					<p>I&#039;m running Kamikaze 8.09.2 and would like to offer SSH access to it on a non-standard wan port while keeping good old port 22 for SSH from the lan side. Dropbear&#039;s config file /etc/config/dropbear doesn&#039;t seem to support this directly. So, is it possible to accomplish something along these lines with iptables port forwarding?</p><p>So far, my tests of forwarding tcp traffic from a non-standard port on the wan interface to port 127.0.0.1:22 have not been successful. I might also have to open one of the ports. If so, which one? I&#039;d think forwarding takes place before any local accepting, but I can&#039;t accept traffic on port 22 or that port would be exposed to the outside world directly. Or am I wrong? I&#039;m confused...</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>I do this exact thing at home.&nbsp; Add something like this to your /etc/firewall.user:</p><p>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p tcp --dport 20022 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1:22<br />iptables -A input_wan -p tcp -d 192.168.1.1 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</p><p>This opens up port 20022 on the WAN side for SSH and leaves it at port 22 for the LAN</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your super fast answer! Since I&#039;m trying to stick to Kamikaze&#039;s config system as much as possible I translated your instructions into this (goes into /etc/config/firewall in case anybody&#039;s interested):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect
    option src    wan
    option src_dport    20022
    option dest    lan
    option dest_ip    192.168.1.1
    option dest_port    22
    option proto    tcp
config rule
    option src    wan
    option proto    tcp
    option dest_ip    192.168.1.1
    option dest_port    22
    option target    ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>It&#039;s still strange to me that port 22 is closed on the wan in the end even though the second block seems to open it specifically. Needless to say, this is exactly what I wanted. Tanks again for your help!</p><p>Edit:<br />Ah, I see, the destination ip part in the second block restricts access to requests originating from within the lan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>penkert</strong> on 20 Jun 2010, 05:51)</p>

					<p>That&#039;s also an interesting option----especially in terms of security. However, since RAM&#039;s a scarce resource on my WRT54GL, I&#039;m trying to run as few services as possible in order to maximize headroom for contrack etc...</p>									</div>
