					<p>Hi! I&#039;m trying to install a strongswan ipsec server on my barrier braker. So far everything went fine, I could connect from my phone (it&#039;s a roadwarrior config) and the payload got encrypted as it should. </p><p>My only problem is configuring the firewall. There is a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.firewall">relevant wiki page</a> on the site , but I have a feeling that there should be an easier way to simply put the dial-in user into the already existing secure zone (which is &#039;lan&#039; in my case). I&#039;m no expert in netfilter, so please excuse me if I assume something stupid.</p><p>As far as I could debug I realized that now the firewall processes the vpn-originated connections like they were coming from the wan interface, which is obviously not what I want. I could install a rule which accepts every traffic from the wan zone coming from the VPN-assigned virtual ips, but it doesn&#039;t look like the most elegant way to go to me. </p><p>Is there any way to force strongswan to install my vpn tunnel like it was inside my lan?</p>									</div>
