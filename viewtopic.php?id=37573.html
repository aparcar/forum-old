					<p>Hi OpenWRTers, i&#039;ve just moved to China from the UK and i&#039;ve picked myself up a Dlink DIR-612 (only available in china <a href="http://www.dlink.com.cn/products/?pid=DIR-612">http://www.dlink.com.cn/products/?pid=DIR-612</a> ) </p><p>Other than the management interface being in Chinese, it&#039;s working just fine to provide my PPPoE and NAT.</p><p>I&#039;v telneted to it and had a poke around, it seems to be a pretty standard BusyBox based system with a squashfs file system.</p><p>Id love to put OpenWRT on it so I can make it selectively proxy or route traffic through my VPN (through the great firewall of china) so I don&#039;t have to use cumbersome VPN clients or proxy configurations separately on each of my home PCs</p><p>I&#039;d really like to minimise the risk of bricking the box before trying anything so I was hoping you guys might be able to help me identify the internals and work out the chances of OpenWRT being compatible.</p><p>I&#039;m happy to share my findings (it seems to me that it might be rather nice to have a simple &quot;bypass the great firewall&quot; solution for others to use.)</p><p>Here&#039;s what I know now. If there&#039;s anything I can do to help work out if this box is compatible please let me know.</p><p># cat /proc/cpuinfo<br />system type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: RTL8196C<br />processor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 0<br />cpu model&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 52481<br />BogoMIPS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 389.12<br />tlb_entries&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: 32<br />mips16 implemented&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : yes</p><p># cat /proc/meminfo<br />MemTotal:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11500 kB<br />MemFree:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;896 kB<br />Buffers:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;408 kB<br />Cached:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2296 kB<br />SwapCached:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 kB<br />Active:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2584 kB<br />Inactive:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1904 kB<br />Active(anon):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 844 kB<br />Inactive(anon):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1056 kB<br />Active(file):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1740 kB<br />Inactive(file):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 848 kB<br />SwapTotal:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 kB<br />SwapFree:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 kB<br />Dirty:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 kB<br />Writeback:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 kB<br />AnonPages:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1916 kB<br />Mapped:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1120 kB<br />Slab:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5356 kB<br />SReclaimable:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 296 kB<br />SUnreclaim:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5060 kB<br />PageTables:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 228 kB<br />NFS_Unstable:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 kB<br />Bounce:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 kB<br />WritebackTmp:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 kB<br />CommitLimit:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5748 kB<br />Committed_AS:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4052 kB<br />VmallocTotal:&nbsp; &nbsp; 1048404 kB<br />VmallocUsed:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;160 kB<br />VmallocChunk:&nbsp; &nbsp; 1022724 kB</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>-sam</p>									</div>
