					<p>My router was made only to get the internet connection through a DSL modem/phone so it doesn&#039;t have a WAN port, so I wanted to ask if it is possible to use one of the LAN ports as a WAN port? On the router&#039;s stock firmware, I was able to redirect all WAN traffic through a LAN port after following a certain URL, but I&#039;m not sure how to do that with OpenWRT. I don&#039;t want to fiddle myself too much with the interfaces in luci, as last time I tried that I was unable to get back into the web gui, and I cannot do a hard reset on this router (as it kicks me into the failsafe mode).<br />If it would be possible, I would prefer to set WAN to LAN4 instead of LAN1<br />Also could not find any relevant threads around these forums.<br />Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>andoru</strong> on 12 Jan 2015, 18:02)</p>

					<p>I would try to create a VLAN (in Network &gt; Switch) for the CPU plus the port where the modem is connected, and another one for the CPU plus the other ports. Then, create an interface on the first VLAN, as a DHCP / PPoE clent, and another interface on the second VLAN, as static private IP address and DHCP server. Then create a forwarding rule from VLAN2 to VLAN2.</p><p>Be careful not to lock yourself out of the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes those are the settings, but I think you should have 3 ports connected to VLAN 1 and one to VLAN 2.</p><p>With a regular router, if you just want a conventional routing for an external DSL modem, use the default settings except set up the switch so you have a wan port and change the WAN mode to pppoe.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure though what the defaults are for a modem/router combo.&nbsp; Are you going to use a separate DSL modem for the wan or some other service like cable?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing you just go to network -- interfaces and edit the WAN physical settings so it is connected to the VLAN instead of the internal modem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 7 Dec 2014, 05:21)</p>

					<p>Settings on the last picture seem OK to me (or perhaps you want to switch VLAN ID&#039;s so 1 is for LAN and 2 for WAN). Yous should now have two separate interfaces called eth0.1 and eth0.2, and it is up to you to decide what to do with each one. If you need to use PPoE to connect to the internet, just configure a new PPoE interface, and link it to the appropriate eth0.x; we will deal with the forwarding part later.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you can connect to some sites, I would bet you can connect to any site; but remember that some/most sites block incoming ICMP ECHO requests, so they just do not respond to PINGs. So, let&#039;s assume you have both interfaces properly configured, and move on to the forwarding part:</p><p>In &quot;Netowrk &gt; Firewall&quot;, create two zones called &quot;WAN&quot; and &quot;LAN&quot;, and attach each one to the corresponding interface. WAN should be configured to &quot;Accept&quot; on &quot;Output&quot;, and &quot;Reject&quot; on &quot;Input&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot;, but &quot;Masquerading&quot; must be active. LAN should be configured to &quot;Accept&quot; on &quot;Input&quot;, &quot;Output&quot;, and &quot;Forward&quot;, but leave &quot;Masquerading&quot; inactive here. Now, allow forwarding from zone LAN to zone WAN (either in &quot;Allow forward to destination zones&quot; in LAN&#039;s configuration, or in &quot;Allow forward from source zones&quot; in WAN&#039;s configuration).</p><p>And that should be it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, now it partly works, I can access Google, Reddit, OpenWRT (and these forums, am connected right now through the router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />) but I can&#039;t access other sites. Also seems I can upload/download over torrents (although very slowly, not sure if it&#039;s the torrents that are slow or here at my end)</p><p>This time I don&#039;t get any errors either, just hangs indefinitely.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>andoru</strong> on 13 Dec 2014, 13:24)</p>
