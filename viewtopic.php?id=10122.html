					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I have a WRT54GL with SD Card Mod, running Kamikaze.&nbsp; I compiled the mmc.o driver with the following gpio definitions:</p><p>#define SD_DI (1 &lt;&lt; 2)<br />#define SD_DO (1 &lt;&lt; 4)<br />#define SD_CLK (1 &lt;&lt; 3)<br />#define SD_CS (1 &lt;&lt; 7 )</p><p>I know the SD Card Mod works as I have used it before with DD-WRT.&nbsp; When I load the mmc.o module and the ext2.o module (SD Card was formated as EXT2), I can mount and read the card correctly without issues, however, within a few seconds, the load on the router goes up to 18+, and there are a log of &quot;/bin/sh /sbin/hotplug button&quot; processes going on.&nbsp; I am assuming that someone the mmc.o driver might be causing hotplug to trigger thinking there the button on the front of the unit was pressed.&nbsp; </p><p>Has anyone had this issue before with any mod to the WRT54GL router and hotplug interfering?&nbsp; Is there a way to tell hotplug to ignore specific actions like the pressing of the button on the front of the router?</p><p>Anything else I can try, do?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>William.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, it appears I had the wrong gpio pins defined.&nbsp; I recompiled the mmc.o driver using the following gpio definition:</p><p>SD_DI&nbsp; 0x04&nbsp; GPIO 2<br />SD_DO&nbsp; 0x10&nbsp; GPIO 4<br />SD_CLK 0x08&nbsp; GPIO 3<br />SD_CS&nbsp; 0x80&nbsp; GPIO 7</p><p>and ran the following command on the router:<br />echo &quot;0x9c&quot; &gt; /proc/diag/gpiomask</p><p>Loaded the mmc.o module and mounted the sd card... no issues with hotplug anymore... read/write to the sd card works perfectly.</p><p>-William</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,<br />just a question for wcastillo, where did you get source code for mmc module ?<br />I&#039;m using kamikaze with 2.6 kernel, today i&#039;ve just synced and i&#039;ve found broadcom-mmc package inside trunk repository, did you used that source code or do you have your own ?<br />I&#039;m very interested in your work, i&#039;ve made a lot of questions to everybody but a real mmc driver doesn&#039;t seems to be present (of course i need to test this new broadcom-mmc package).<br />Can you provide us more details on your job ?</p><p>Thank you in advance for your reply<br />Andrea (Ben) Benini</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Santosh0705,</p><p>The command&nbsp; &#039;echo 0x9c &gt; /proc/diag/gpiomask&#039; is to avoid hotplug issues.&nbsp; The 0x9c could also be 0x8e, it all depends on which gpio pins you use for your mmc module.&nbsp; Basically you can determine the hex value by using the bitwise left shift of the gpio pins you used. Example, on my setup:</p><p>SD_DI&nbsp; 0x04&nbsp; GPIO 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 &lt;&lt; 2 =&nbsp; &nbsp;4<br />SD_DO&nbsp; 0x10&nbsp; GPIO&nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &lt;&lt; 4 =&nbsp; &nbsp;16<br />SD_CLK 0x08&nbsp; GPIO 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 &lt;&lt; 3 =&nbsp; 8<br />SD_CS&nbsp; 0x80&nbsp; GPIO 7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &lt;&lt; 7 = 128<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 156 in hex is 0x9c&nbsp; </p><p>Source (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8543">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=8543</a>).&nbsp; When I missed this step, my router kept acting strange, can&#039;t remember the error that I got in dmesg, but it was annoying and prevent me from being able to read/write to the sd card.</p><p>Hi ben72,</p><p>The mmc source code I used was found in one of the how-to&#039;s in google.&nbsp; Its been a while, but I believe it was &quot;<a href="http://kiel.kool.dk/mmc.c">http://kiel.kool.dk/mmc.c</a>&quot; (source: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing/Hardware/MMC)">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Cus â€¦ dware/MMC)</a>.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there is an official mmc driver.&nbsp; When I first did this, I was a new to openwrt (whiterussian and kamikaze).&nbsp; I need to re-do this for both of my new wrt54gl routers.&nbsp; I should have them done by Friday at which point I will post more information.&nbsp; FYI there are plenty of how-to&#039;s on this subject.</p><p>Hi Rizzi,</p><p>I don&#039;t have the module at this moment, but as soon as I compile it, I will send it to you.</p><p>Thanks all, if I missed something or didn&#039;t answer your question, I do apologize, my workload increased rapidly in the past few minutes while I was replying.&nbsp; Let me know if you guys need anything else.</p><p>William</p>									</div>
