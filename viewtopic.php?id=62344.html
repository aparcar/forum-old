					<p>posting this after searching and digging for long time, though my problem seem simple I think my poor ability to know what to look for is also a problem. </p><p>so ... <br />Yesterday, I connected my archer c7 (openwrt) to serial (uart pl2303h) and successfully fixed a problem that I created when playing with one of the configuration files (/etc/config/network). <br />after the successful fix I unplugged the serial and immediately connected the power supply (12v, 3A) to the socket , I noticed a small surge and after that the archer wont even light up, lying dead on my table. yes, I know... I am talented. </p><p>status <br />1) when connected to power line, nothing happen. <br />2) still, when connected to serial the archer turns ON and works flawlessly</p><p>after searching I found this a <br /><a href="http://www.kphonline.co.uk/2012/12/repairing-a-dead-tp-link-pa211-powerline-ethernet-adapter-part1/#.VqSfSLMvDRY">http://www.kphonline.co.uk/2012/12/repa … qSfSLMvDRY</a></p><p>making me believe that it might be a capacitor issue, so my questions&nbsp; - <br />is it the capacitor ? how can I test the electric parts ? is there hope ?</p>									</div>
