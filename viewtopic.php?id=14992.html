					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m using Whiterussian for a long time now and want to switch to Kamikaze.</p><p>My Router is a ASUS WL-500GP.

					<p>Dear Zanthos</p><p>In many ways the best thing you can do is to start playing around with the build-system - which again requires that you have a functional Linux system (either as a stand-alone or virtual system, as suggested by forum2008). It should not be a major problem for you to install a dual-boot setup, if you can insert a MiniPCI card then you can also install one of the major Linux distributions.</p><p>But, I&#039;m at the moment working on a &#039;small book&#039; on how to use the OpenWrt buildsystem and you might as well help me with some feedback on the present alpha version. Send me an email and I&#039;ll forward you a copy, and in return you tell me if it works.</p><p>Chz</p>									</div>
