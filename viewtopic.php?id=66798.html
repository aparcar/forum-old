					<p>I was just wondering, from those who follow the dev branch closely, whether it&#039;s shaping up nicely or if there&#039;s a long way to go yet. I&#039;m thinking of this as we&#039;re coming up on the anniversary of CC.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWRT is probably dead. They might do a DD release some day, but you have to ask what the release objectives were in the first place. There wasn&#039;t any. They just pooped out releases whenever a couple of the devs were happy with progress or people complained that it had been 1.5 years since the last release and they felt forced to do something.</p><p>Most of the development is now going on in LEDE. However, they are not doing a good job of bringing over the end-user community. They don&#039;t have a user mailing list, message board, release statements, wiki, etc etc. That&#039;s something they need to fix. However, the LEDE builds are unstable enough right now that it&#039;s not worth bringing the user base over, so everything is kind of in limbo right now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jmomo</strong> on 13 Aug 2016, 12:46)</p>

					<p>I think we all have to wait and see what happens.&nbsp; Lots of speculation, and &quot;factual&quot; statements don&#039;t really help anyone.</p><p>Both OpenWRT and LEDE are being worked on currently.</p><p>What the future is, I think we can all agree, is a bit unknown.&nbsp; Implying OpenWRT is finished however, is based purely on speculation at this point, since dev&#039;s are working on it as I type this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks all, somehow I&#039;d overlooked LEDE.&nbsp; Their &quot;About&quot; page looks very, very encouraging to me, with phrases like &quot;stability and functionality&quot; and &quot;regular, predictable release cycles.&quot;</p>									</div>
