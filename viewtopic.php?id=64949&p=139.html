Win7 well-known of it&#039;s ipv6 incompatibility. Disable ipv6 on wired NIC and see what happened.<br />2. Some network adapters, all-time-bugged Atheros especially, can be simple incompatible to others. Try to play with NIC drivers (upgrade to latest or downgrade to early).<br />3. Sometimes, devices can make real ARP-storm at the network - i have a situation before, then 5 Linksys AP devices trashed all wired network segment completely. So, keep you eye at ARP list at the router - look for wired/strange entries there (it&#039;s under /status/routes in LUCI).</p><p>I think p1 is most probably the source of this problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>T-Troll</strong> on 2 Oct 2017, 09:51)</p>

					<p>Hello!&nbsp; I have a very strange issue.</p><p>I have a single SSID broadcasting on both 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies.&nbsp; I have a printer that connects using 2.4 as that&#039;s all it supports.&nbsp; That printer is unreachable via other clients on the same 2.4Ghz frequency.&nbsp; However, my clients on 5Ghz have no problem accessing the printer.&nbsp; So my laptop (5Ghz) can print to the printer with no problems, but my daughter&#039;s laptop (2.4Ghz) cannot.</p><p>My first thought was I must have set the &quot;Isolate clients&quot; advanced setting, but that&#039;s unchecked on both frequencies.</p><p>Is this some sort of bug?&nbsp; I recall it being discussed weeks, if not months, ago.&nbsp; It&#039;s been driving me CRAZY trying to find a solution other than buying either a new printer or new laptops.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m running a WRT1900AC with Lede Reboot SNAPSHOT r4901-ab26fc6c8d / LuCI Master (git-17.260.43176-678c15c).</p><p>//Brew</p>									</div>
