					<p>I&#039;m not sure I understood your question correctly, but you need basically kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan, usb-modeswitch, and uqmi. I&#039;ll add documentation to wiki on how to configure qmi during the weekend.

Most of these are managed using a mix of standard GSM AT commands and vendor specific AT commands over a serial function.&nbsp; But some of the Huawei devices use an in-band management channel, like QMI and MBIM, but still use AT commands over this channel.</p><p>BTW, thanks for your work on getting QMI support in OpenWRT.&nbsp; It is fun to see how things can get moving once we get a simple driver like this into mainline Linux :-)</p>									</div>
