					<p>Hi folks, I&#039;d like to build my own patches for the openwrt kernel so I&#039;m trying to reproduce the same steps of the automated build.</p><p>I am currently working with the ar71xx platform on the TRUNK (kernel 3.18.11). So, from what I have peeked during the kernel build, the system : </p><ul><li><p>Downloads the kernel offical sources</p></li><li><p>applies the linux/generic patches</p></li><li><p>applies the linux/ar71xx patches</p></li></ul><p>After downloading the tarball of the sources from kernel.org, I put in one folder the uncompressed kernel sources and the generic-3.18 and ar71xx-3.18 patches. Then after browsing into the kernel sources folder, I run a simple for control loop <strong>--dry-run</strong> one-liner :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>for i in ../generic-3.18/*.patch
do
    patch -p1 --dry-run &lt; $i
done</code></pre></div><p>However, I get a lot of mismatches/FUZZ....where am i wrong ? I also think that before applying the patches, some files are copied/overwritten into the sources kernel folder. I have the hunch that they are the contents of every files folder of every specific platform....</p><p>woud you be so kind to help me ? Can you guide me step-by-step ?</p><p>thanks in advance, Arturo</p>									</div>

If you wanna create your own patch, I strongly suggest you read this <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/patches">Working with patches</a> and be familiar with quilt.</p>									</div>
