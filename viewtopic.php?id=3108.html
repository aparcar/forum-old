					<p>I want to install open wrt on a WAP55AG. It has an atheros chip 5312 onboard. What open wrt will work on it? Does anyone know the best smallest packet for thta chipset? How can i find out how much memory my wap has? </p><p>ps1. I don`t care about 802.11a in the moment only make the WAP55AG work as a bridge in b or g mode but being able to lower the tx power. </p><p>ps2. Sorry for asking to many questions </p><p>ps.3 <br />The flash chip is MX 29LV160BBTC-90 (1M x 16) does this means it is 1MB? <br />The RAM chip is ISSI IS42S32200B-6T</p>									</div>
