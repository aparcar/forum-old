					<p>I&#039;ve just installed OpenWRT on my TP-Link MR3020 router, and by some great luck, I&#039;ve managed to get it set up over ethernet to my laptop, and now that I&#039;ve plugged it into my cable modem, I&#039;m happily browsing the web over wifi via the new router.</p><p>Maybe you can help me with this problem, though:</p><p>I can no longer access the router over telnet, SSH, or Luci (via the browser). I&#039;m trying to get to it at the 192.168.1.1 address, and I can&#039;t rouse it at all. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s something simple like me having the wrong IP address or something.</p><p>Much obliged if you can point me in the right direction,</p><p>Jacob</p>									</div>

					<p>If you unplugged from your modem and plug it back to computer can you access<br />after you set a password the telnet daemon will be disabled, type exit into the prompt<br />without reboot, SSH is now available; so is HTTPS if the WebUI (LuCI) is installed with it&#039;s TLS-modules</p>									</div>
