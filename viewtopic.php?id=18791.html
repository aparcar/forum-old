					<p>Hi and welcome,</p><p>dgi has linked to another post in a forum that he has OpenWrt booting but it was lacking support for the IDE and/or SATA hard drive.<br />Without support for that there is not much use to put openwrt on the device except to use the USB ports possibly.<br />Reference: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=75503#p75503">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=75503#p75503</a></p><p>I have been using the stuff from here (http://mgb111.pradnik.net/) and the web interface isn&#039;t any better looking but it has the ability to run scripts and compiled code on it easier than the stock firmware. ie. telnet, ssh, tftp, webserver etc</p>									</div>
