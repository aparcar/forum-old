					<p>I&#039;ve got a WRT54G v2.2 running Backfire 10.03.&nbsp; I wish to configure it to use an Android device as a WAN gateway (via WiFi) for computers connected to the LAN (via the ethernet ports).&nbsp; The Android device seems to provide NAT and DHCP, and uses the Ad-Hoc type of network (It&#039;s Barnacle WiFi Tether: <a href="http://szym.net/barnacle/">http://szym.net/barnacle/</a> ).&nbsp; Its encryption can be none, or WEP.</p><p>(Please forgive me if I use the wrong terminology here and there for this network stuff--it&#039;s not something on which I have a strong grasp.)</p><p>I&#039;ve spent some time reading OpenWRT documentation and exploring the shell and http interface, but I&#039;m still not quite confident on where to begin.&nbsp; Am I correct in thinking I can do the configuration largely by editing the files in /etc/config?</p>									</div>

					<p>Does the device broadcast an SSID? In other words, if you use another wifi enabled device can you see the Android as a wifi point?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, philchetcuti.&nbsp; Yes, the Android device can be made to broadcast the SSID.&nbsp; For example, I can see the device as an Ad-Hoc WiFi point in the NetworkManager applet on my Toshiba laptop running Ubuntu Jaunty.</p>									</div>

					<p>you are right about the /etc/config, in fact you need to start with /etc/config/wireless<br />full description of that file and its settings is at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a></p><p>roughly you need to make your /etc/config/wireless look somewhat as follows</p><p>config &#039;wifi-device&#039; &#039;wl0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;type&#039; &#039;broadcom&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;channel&#039; &#039;5&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;disabled&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;wl0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;AndroidSSID&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;network&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;sta&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;wep&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;key&#039; &#039;wepkeyforandroid&#039;</p><p>Make sure you set channel to the channel that android is broadcasting on.</p><p>If you are currently using your WRT54G as a wireless device then you need more settings in that file which will allow you to use AP and STA modes at the same time.
