					<p>Hello all;</p><p>I have just discovered OpenWRT a week or two ago, and I like it a lot as a platform for embedded linux application.<br />I am testing it in a Banana Pi without problems so far.<br />However, my question comes related to the use of OpenWrt (or any other elinux distro, I presume) in not supported HW.<br />For example, if a my company develops HW based on ARM v7, with its memory, buses, GPIOS, and communications....<br />How can I specify all this hardware to create a boot capable of running the kernel and OpenWrt, with possibilities to access all my hardware in a correct way?<br />To make things short, what could be de process to make an U-Boot for a propietary designed board? Could this boot and OpenWrt be loaded in Flash memory?</p><p>Thank you very much !!!</p>									</div>
