					<p>Well IMO there is no perfect router, and firmware combo.</p><p>Looks like you have a simple needs router. Basically non remote devices are hard wired.</p><p>Wireless printers don&#039;t require a router, if using authentication to connect, unless you cloud print. My printers don&#039;t connect to the Internet, so i do manual updates if needed.</p><p>Looks like you are not even using G, or can setup with an N connection. So it looks like ASUS us the way to go, especially if you are already familiar. As ASUS has some strong N and AC routers. I chose the linksys for G in multi story house. Which few routers are better at with G.</p><p>Luckily there is one ASUS router that is one of two routers that can run Untangled, if you find OpenWrt not to your needs. I forget the model but, you may look it up on the Untangled wiki. The linksys wrt1900acs is the only other router, which I have and will try OpenWrt first before moving on to Untangled, if i find a need to.</p><p>So i would look at a router that has the greatest support offerings, and abilities. So far I only see a few wrt offerings that are worth trying, as they are more active than the manufacturer that supports the product.</p>									</div>

At first the original firmware was flaky and wiped out settings and soon was updated.</p><p>I am not sure if the hardware or nature of stock firmware, but it took a bit of messing with channels, frequency, and type (toggling wireless settings), to obtain 36 mbps on strict N&nbsp; at 20 mhz on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz, with a 72 mbps connection link established.</p><p>Contrary to what I find on the Internet i get 75% throughput on my wireless connections using my setup. I assume from early tests with 40mhz channels i got higher throughput around 85% of my 50 mbps advertised Internet connection speed.</p><p>Downstairs it drops down to 32mbps to 18 mbps, depending on connection and location with devices.</p><p>Will be upgrading my miracast to the newer AC 5 Ghz and my laptop to dual channel N for better interplay with speeds on lan. Will then move into 40mhz range.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Notsofast</strong> on 31 Dec 2017, 17:14)</p>

					<p>I&#039;d stay out of asus because of broadcom (bad radio and closed source). TP link recently swithed from atheros to mediatek, so there are many problems too. But at least there&#039;s hope it will work some day, broadcom will never work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have had the same type of issue.&nbsp; I have suddenlink in North Carolina.&nbsp; I use a provided hitron cable modem.&nbsp; So I keep running out of bandwith.&nbsp; So I just flashed 3 Meraki MR-24&#039;s.&nbsp; WIth OpenWRT on them and just a basic configuration, I have WDS master AP and 2 WDS client AP&#039;s.&nbsp; They scream and with the firmware change it seems to actually be faster.&nbsp; I paid $8.00 for each of the MR-24.&nbsp; I have a MR-26 still under maintenance and I have a guest network setup on that one. </p><p>I have extreamly detailed notes on how to setup the MR-24&#039;s.&nbsp; I will be glad to share..&nbsp; Trying to get the instructions on a web page that I can share with the forum.<br />RC</p>									</div>
