					<p>Kernel 3.18 has had it last <a href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1702.1/00296.html">update</a> and in the announcement Greg Kroah-Hartman indicates that 4.4 is a &quot;better&quot; kernel.&nbsp; Would this apply to embedded devices?&nbsp; In particular my Trendnet 732BR initially came with&nbsp; kernel 2.6.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if the device drivers and networking stack really have changed significantly for an older device such as the 732BR?</p><p>Anyone running a 4.4 based snapshot have a sense if it is worth upgrading?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 10 Feb 2017, 15:16)</p>

					<p>Hi mate I don&#039;t know specifics, but there has bin lots of changes to the WIFI from the make wifi fast folks.</p><p>1. Reduce latency on a single AP, single station connected at the lowest rate (6mbits) to under 30ms under load, down from the commonly observed 600ms or more, while not sacrificing peak throughput under real world conditions<br />2. Develop new packet scheduling and AQM techniques applicable to aggregated, parking lot network types<br />3. Improve the stack sufficiently for 802.11ac MU-MIMO to actually work<br />4. Save the world<br /><a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/make-wifi-fast/wiki/Wifi_Stack_Rework/">https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/ma … ck_Rework/</a><br /><a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/">https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/</a><br />As far as i know all the Bufferbloat stuf went in to kernel 3.18 for wired and 4.4 for wifi. It all depends on what hardware your using. Apart from that there has bin lots of bugs fixed since kernel 2.6</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the links.&nbsp; The wireless on my 732BR is &quot;n&quot; @ 300mbps.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll wait for the final 4.4 release.&nbsp; Binary size is not a big issue, 15.0.1 is padded to 8mb flash for the initial install but updates are less than 4mb.&nbsp; My current img added netstat and a simple mail program and seems to be running well.</p>									</div>
