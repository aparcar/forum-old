					<p>Hello guys. </p><p>I have a Xiaomi Wifi Mini router on its way to my mailbox and I am trying to gather either svn or git url to pandorabox&#039;s buildroot, the Chinese one that contains the proprietary xiaomi / mediatek wifi driver.</p><p>There are quite few pre-built and customized Pandorabox images out there, however even the customized ones without Chinese lang are heavily bloated, and as always I want to be able to build my bare bone minimal image. </p><p>I don&#039;t even use LUCI to mention something, and to my knowledge every pre-built Pandorabox images do comes with LUCI.</p><p>Could anybody help me out with this? Unfortunately I don&#039;t speak Chinese and after few hours of researches I decided to come here seeking for help.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
