					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m currently connected to the internet by a shared 100mbit connection. My machine is on a local network behind NAT. I would like to be able to contact my computer remotely, so I&#039;ve bought a OpenVPN-tunnel with a static IP, that forwards all traffic to my computer as long as I&#039;m connected to the VPN provider. This works very well. </p><p>However, I would like power on/off my computer using wake-on-lan. I have the idea that this might be possible by setting up a router with OpenWRT and letting it connect to the VPN provider with OpenVPN. The router should then run a webserver where i can log in a power on my machine, and forward traffic on certain ports to my machine through the router. So the router should act like a gateway where all traffic is routed through the VPN tunnel.</p><p>This leads to two questions:</p><p>1: Is this possible?<br />2: If it is, what router should i buy? Will a WRT54G do or should I go with a WL-500g Premium?</p><p>As you probably have figured out English isn&#039;t my native language, so if anything of the above is unclear, please let me know. </p><p>Thank you in advance</p><p>/Ledet</p>									</div>
