					<p>thanks; question is how to make OpenWRT&#039;s httpd server respond to any request, even if the request is originally not intended for the OpenWRT&#039;s server.<br />Have a script that tests availability of internet access via ADSL/WAN; if OK all http requests should go out onto the internet normally; if not OK would like the OpenWRT&#039;s server to respond with a page that I can define, even if the OpenWRT server is not at all the URL that the user has defined. But this requires that httpd translates whatever internet URL requested into the page defined by me in the WRT54G. How to do that ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Here&#039;s how I would do it:</p><p>1. Every x seconds or minutes, run a script which checks for WAN access.&nbsp; You could do anything here, such as:<br />- Ping an Internet server<br />- Use &quot;wget&quot; to try and connect to a webserver on the Internet<br />- Check that the WAN IP address is valid</p><p>2. If the above script returns a negative response, add an IPTables entry to the firewall which does the following:<br />- Alters the PEROUTING table to change the destination IP address of any HTTP (Port 80) packets to be the router<br />- Alters the INPUT table to allow connections to the internal webserver</p><p>After that, any connections to anywhere on TCP Port 80 will be NAT translated and redirected to the router&#039;s webserver.&nbsp; Of course, in the meantime you keep your WAN checking script running at regular intervals.&nbsp; As soon as the WAN comes back up, your script removes the IPTables entries you made.</p><p>How does that sound?</p><p>Kaldek</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt; How does that sound?</p><p>That doesn&#039;t solve the problem. The problem is that either the web server needs to respond to any request, or a redirect needs to be done. I would suppose that the earlier suggestion to use a splash like nocatsplash would work - the script would just need to turn it on/off as needed.</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>

					<p>as promised the results of experiments to show a message page to all internal network users when adsl is not available:<br />A simple solution is one on basis of &#039;nc&#039;. But nc terminates after it has been contacted one time. So it needs to be in a permanent loop that restarts nc whenever it has stopped. As I only want to show one particular html page when the adsl connectivity is not available, I used nc&#039;s option to receive input from a file, in this case a file in html format. So there is no need for the redirect script as kindly suggested by MJB if a text message is enough.<br />If a more sophisticated message is required with all html capabilities and graphics the script suggested by mjb will help out. </p><p>Had already a crond controlled script that tries the adsl connection every three minutes with three pings; if it fails I make sure via telnet that the modem is in working condition and now also call a script &#039;redirect_start&#039;.<br />That script activates nc listening on port 81, it redirects via iptables all port 80 traffic to port 81 of the wrt54g, and it starts another script that pings every second to the provider to see whether the line is back up already. If it is back up from the pinging script a script &#039;redirect_stop&#039; is called which removes the iptables entry and kills nc and the pinging script. Make sure that in the crond started script always redirect_stop precedes redirect_start to prevent accumulation of processes. After all it can happen that after three minutes the line did not come back up and this gets detected again.&nbsp; Here the simple scripts I am now using (v2.2 box, adsl is on vlan1):</p><p>***/etc/redirect_start***<br />#!/bin/sh<br />IFS=</p><p>/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to-destination **IP_of_WRT**:81<br />/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -i vlan0 -j DNAT --to-destination **IP_of_WRT**:81</p><p>/etc/spawn_nc<br />/etc/spawn_ping</p><p>***/etc/spawn_nc***<br />#!/bin/sh<br />IFS=</p><p>while :; do<br />/usr/bin/nc -l -p 81 &lt; **/www/infopage.html** &gt; /dev/null<br />done &amp;</p><p>***/etc/spawn_ping***<br />#!/bin/sh<br />IFS=</p><p>while :; do<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if /bin/ping -c 1 **ip_of_provider** | grep -q &#039;1 packets received&#039;; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /etc/redirect_stop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /bin/sleep 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fi<br />done &amp;</p><p>***/etc/redirect_stop***<br />#!/bin/sh<br />IFS=<br />/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to-destination **IP_of_WRT**:81<br />/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -i vlan0 -j DNAT --to-destination **IP_of_WRT**:81<br />/usr/bin/killall -9 spawn_nc<br />/usr/bin/killall -9 nc<br />/usr/bin/killall -9 spawn_ping</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 27 Sep 2005, 12:06)</p>

					<p>Thanks for further suggestions.<br />Have installed xinetd, no problem, but have not found a way to then get cat or nc to give a reply to the calling browser. Used port 81 for test purpose and xinetd spawns the defined answering process but it seems that the answering process has no awareness of port 81 and just sends its output to standard output. Port 81 sort of triggers the start but then cat does not get connected to that port. NC, in turn, starts listening but the opening call was already used by xinetd and further nothing happens. Am probably missing something in the setup of xinetd and its service descriptor file for the answering or redirect script to work properly but don&#039;t know yet what it is.</p><p>In the mean time the other solution works but agree that xinetd would be the more elegant way to control responses to multiple browsers and their users in a concurrent way.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 28 Sep 2005, 12:33)</p>
