					<p>Hi,</p><p>I created my own firmware image for my WRT54g, and I also have my own configuration files (like firewall.user, ssh public key, things in /etc/config/ and so on...).<br />Now I want to know: How can I include ALL these files into a firmware image?<br />I just want to flash the image and then everthing is done already, no need to transfer any files or setting up a telnet/ssh-password...</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm.. still something wierd with my image...<br />Some config files are not overwritten with my files, ex. /etc/config/wireless is keeping the original (same as if reset the device).<br />But all the other files look okay.<br />And even if I change /etc/config/wireless it after flash and reboot, the old config comes back.<br />The /etc/config/wireless is not readonly and I can save them.. but after reboot it changes back.<br />But only that file.. </p><p>Why?</p><p>Cheers<br />-Anders</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, if no match squashfs version, the message is that you say.<br />Squashfs version need be the same (4.2 on trunk), and on Ubuntu I have Squashfs-tools 1:4.2.1.<br />Try with: &quot;unsquashfs file.squashfs&quot;, i.e. with my router it&#039;s &quot;unsquashfs openwrt-ar71xx-generic-root.squashfs&quot; (on trunk/bin/ar71xx after compiling).<br />For older versions you can find the squashfs code (usually lzma-version), it&#039;s a bit more complicated but not impossible.<br />Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />&gt; Can old stuff from a previous image flash stick on the router somehow?<br />No, all is erased (AFAIK). Bin are a mix (vmlinux, squashfs and jffs2) and .squashfs becomes /rom on your router. Perhaps some initial configuration script is creating the file (maybe a bug), in my case there is no problem with wireless (that I put on trunk/files/etc/config before compiling).<br />A patch could be: create a wireless file with your settings, i.e. wireless.mimeo, put a command on rc.local for re-write wireless with your file and restart wireless. At least until you discover where the fault. Regards.</p>									</div>
