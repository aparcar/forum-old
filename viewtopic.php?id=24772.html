					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I am using the ath9k driver for Wireless N. I set up as WPA2-PSK only, and using the 2.4 GHz range. I have tried all settings I could think of to modify for the wireless -- even looking at the wiki wireless guide. However, I still have this issue: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24350">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24350</a><br />In brief, my wireless will work for a while, but then all PCs are disconnected, and no one can connect to the wireless again even though there is a strong signal. Can I have authentication done via one of the other packages, like WPAD, or Xsupplicant? If so, how do I do that? I did have hostapd installed by itself, but I recently put on WPAD and Xsupplicant because I want to try those out to see if they fix the issue. Is this possible?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was told by someone on the other forum that the wpad-midi is the drop-in replacement for both the hostapd-mini and the wpasupplicant-mini. So it should be enough just to deinstall hostapd and install wpad/wpad-mini instead. OpenWRT wifi-scripts should do the rest of the work, automatically detecting the presence of the wpad and using it instead of hostapd.</p><p>P.S. This should work with OpenWRT 10.03 or later.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>Upd.</strong> In case your firmware is not self-compiled, it should be more safe to opkg uninstall all the wpa_supplicant*, hostapd* and wpad*, and then install the only parts you&#039;re going to use. </p><p>Take a look at this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@dir825NSAHome:~# ls -la /usr/sbin/wpa* /usr/sbin/hosta*
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             4 May 17 22:44 /usr/sbin/hostapd -&gt; wpad
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             4 May 17 22:44 /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -&gt; wpad
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        421263 May 17 22:37 /usr/sbin/wpad</code></pre></div><p>This box has got only wpad-mini installed. As you can see, hostapd and wpa_supplicant are both there, but they are the symlinks to the wpad executable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lexa2</strong> on 18 May 2010, 19:28)</p>
