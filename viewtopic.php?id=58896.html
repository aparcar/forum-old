					<p>I have an IPTV box, and would like to tunnel traffic to it over a tunnel (my MoCA link limits multicast to 10 Mbps which is not good for HDTV). I have created a GRE tunnel and bridged it with the IPTV VLAN, but all large packets are dropped.</p><p>I can see the packets do have the DF (Don&#039;t Fragment) bit set. </p><p>How can I bridge large packets over a tunnel ? Is there a lightweight tunnel type that silently fragments and reassembles packets ? I know the ISPs does this over ATM over DSL, as it has a very small frame size (53 bytes).</p><p>Can I clear the DF flag and expect success ? How can I do this ? They are coming in on eth0.3, which are part of the gre-bridge curently not working.<br />I have bandwidth for overhead of fragmented packets.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if the multicast packets has the DF flag (not part of my dump this time around).</p>									</div>
