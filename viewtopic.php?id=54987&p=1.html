					<p>I&#039;ve tried to build fw with patch mentioned in openwrt wiki, got no 5ghz device and very low signal from ap on 2.4 GHz, tried compiling trunk(there is a choice for this device), got 5ghz device, but ap on 5ghz won&#039;t go up and still very low signal on 2.4 GHz. Have not tried binary from this thread, but I assume it would be the same. There&#039;s definitely something wrong with 2860 driver there (5ghz, 7612e scans for networks ok,shows good signal, but ap won&#039;t bring up). I have 128mb ram instead of 64, mentioned in wiki. There&#039;s some proprietary driver for both 2.4 &amp; 5 GHz devices,&nbsp; it is used in pandorabox(Chinese fork of openwrt) but looks like it isn&#039;t compatible with luci, I&#039;ve tried to flash pandirabox, but interface is Chinese, I&#039;ve managed to switch to Russian and stock openwrt theme, but could not bring up 5ghz neither 2.4 ap or sta mode using luci, it seems to me stock Chinese interface may be capable of that, but there&#039;s no way I could understand those symbols. So for me openwrt on this device is hardly working one. Anyone got decent performance of this device running openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dnkn</strong> on 19 May 2015, 02:12)</p>
