					<p>Hi as tittle says I have and TP-LINK TL-WR941ND V3.2 wich I flashed with OpenWrt Kamikaze Trunk. So far the router boots and I&#039;m able to telnet into de router (and SSH after changing root password) an execute commands like mtd, uci, etc....</p><p>The problem is that I can access to the web interface!!!! </p><p>To make things short:<br />I used Ubuntu 9.10 32Bits Virtual machine (VBox based) as build environment and using following command to check out source</p><p>svn checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk</p><p>then I did &quot;make menuconfig&quot; and set following</p><p>Target System ---&gt; AR71XX<br />Target Platform ---&gt; TL-WR941NDV2</p><p>I also changed OpenWrt´s default Lan IP to 192.168.0.254 (accordly to my Lan configuratio) and then exit saving changes... then I built the firmware typing &quot;make&quot;, no errors so far so I flashed my router through manufacturer web interface using the generated openwrt-ar71xx-squashfs-universal.bin(or something like that).</p><p>Doing some research through router filesystem i found that /www folder is empty so I tried to install both LUCI (first) and webif to ram but both fails even using &quot;-d ram&quot; switch fo opkg and setting option overlay_root&nbsp; to /tmp (instead of /jffs)...</p><p>My main Problem is that I&#039;m stuck right now cause I even tried to reflash a newly compiled openwrt with webif installed but flashing just won&#039;t take any effect</p><p>Using mtd -e firmware write openwrt.trx firmware doesn&#039;t through any error but after rebooting the firmware is exactly the same as before reflasing, i also noticed that any change I made to config (even root password) is lost after rebooting the router....</p><p>as a last resource I´ve tried to return to manufacturer firmware but i get the following error:</p><p>Writing from wr941nv2.trx to firmware ..... [e]Failed to erase block</p><p>I´ve also tried flashing the bin provided by the manufacturer but got same error.... so i&#039;m starting to get desperated</p><p>Sorry for the long post</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still figthing....</p><p>Right know I switched to to serial port but still unable to flash anything on my router... even using U-Boot.

					<p>Well I was able to find Intel&#039;s S33 Flash Memory datasheet (my router has an 320S33B)</p><p><a href="http://www.silica.com/fileadmin/02_Products/05_Product-News/05_Memories/ITL-S33/IntelS33.pdf">http://www.silica.com/fileadmin/02_Prod … telS33.pdf</a></p><p>It appears that this memories has a combined register/hardware protection mode that can be used to protect some sectors of the memory:</p><p>from 64 to 127 on 64M Chips<br />From 32 to 67 on 32M Chips<br />From 16 to 31 on 16M Chips</p><p>Additionally these chips has some separated sector that are OTP (One-Time Programming)</p><p>You are right, so far the only way i can think to recover our routers is to flash directly to memory, but unfortunately I was unable to find that JTAG conector, in fact I´m thinking it was removed from this revision...</p><p>Anyway my skills on electronics are limited but I think I can use an 18F2550/4550 to gain access to the memory through SPI Bus, the idea is to check an disable (where possible) write protection by driving pin 9 (W#) to high, then playing with SRWD and BP bits to see if we are able to write through normal MTD</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fzfq3m</strong> on 21 Dec 2009, 15:32)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve seen this problem with other revisions of the wr941nd, but as far as I can tell it seems to be a problem that only affects some units. I know it sounds strange but I have flashed openwrt on a lot of these and about 10-15% seem to have the problem. Also, looking at the MACs of the units that have the problem it seems some MAC-ranges are more prone to this than others.</p><p>A strange problem I must say... Could it be some bridge somewhere that is not correctly closed/open on some units? The very strange part is that the initial openwrt flash always works! It&#039;s after flashing openwrt that the flash is somehow frozen... Could it be something in the openwrt flash image? Maybe a combination of the two?</p>									</div>

					<p>As Far I can tell my router&#039;s flash memory doesn´t have hardware Write Protection enabled because W# pin (PIN 9) is driven high on normal boot... and according datasheet this pin needs to be LOW in order to enable that feature... I only need to check the status register to see if the chip is Software Write Protected by default... so I will need to use some In-Circuit SPI interface to gain direct access to the chip</p><p>I´m still waiting for an PIC18F4550 that I&#039;ve ordered, my idea is to check and modify these register to allow programming... or in the worse case to try to program the memory directly using the PIC...</p><p>One thing tha makes me worry is that these chips appears to have an OTP (One Time Programming) memory section...

					<p>fzfq3m,<br />What I&#039;m using as a USB interface is a mobile phone data cable......<br />since router voltage is 3.3V, I left the router TXD line intact as 3.3V will be recognised as a 5V logic one<br />on the TX side, I have done a potential divider, so that the 5V signal will be level translated to 3.3V or in the whereabouts.<br />Edward</p>									</div>

					<p>orodriguez, you don&#039;t need to remove black front panel... instead you need to remove top cover instead. <br />After you remove the screws you need to separate a bit the top and bottom covers (in the back side) and then you need to pull out that black &quot;U&quot; form that have the antenna port attached... do it gently and don´t pull it out to far from the case because the antenna pigtails are soldered directly to pcb... after that you should now have access to two detents that are one each side of front panel (inside)... use a small flathead screwdriver two open those detents... you need to manage to keep then open because there´s a three more detents that you need to open in order to completely remove the top cover... </p><p>The remaining detents are smaller ones and they are located in the upper part of the black front panel, you can use same small flathead screwdriver between the top cover and the black front panel (above the &quot;1&quot; Led that indicate Port One) to separate them... after that, if all went fine, you shuold have easy access to your router´s inside.</p><br /><p>DummyPLUG thanks for the advice... I&#039;m having some trouble compiling lattest trunk after doing &quot;svn up&quot; so I&#039;m downloading a fresh copy right now</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright, I compiled a fresh kamikaze trunk r19223 (no svn up) with following parameters:<br />Target System (Atheros AR71xx/AR7240/AR913x)<br />Target Profile (TP-LINK TL-WR941ND v2)<br />Target Images ---&gt; ramdisk compression (LZMA)</p><p>after saving menuconfig and executed make download it generates the following files in bin/ar71xx<br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.elf (4.009KB)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.bin (3.969KB)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.gz (2.624KB)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-gzip.bin (2.568KB)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.lzma (2.304KB)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-lzma.bin (2.273KB)</p><p>I copied these 6 files into my tftp server root directory plus the original firmware without header+u-boot part (removed with dd if=tlwr941ndv2.bin of=original.bin skip=131584 bs=1)</p><p>Not matter what file I use, I always get error booting from U-Boot</p><p>If I try to boot the following images:<br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.elf ------&gt; (iminfo returns &quot;Bad Magic Number&quot;)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.bin------&gt; (iminfo returns &quot;Bad Magic Number&quot;)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.gz&nbsp; -----&gt; (iminfo returns &quot;Bad Magic Number&quot;)<br />openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-gzip.bin ----------&gt; (iminfo returns this: <a href="http://pastebin.com/me1b90d0)">http://pastebin.com/me1b90d0)</a><br />openwrt-ar71xx-uImage-lzma.bin ---------&gt; (iminfo returns this: <a href="http://pastebin.com/d606dec8f)">http://pastebin.com/d606dec8f)</a><br />openwrt-ar71xx-vmlinux-initramfs.lzma --&gt; (iminfo returns &quot;Bad Magic Number&quot;)</p><p>then i get: &quot;Booting image at 81000000 ...

					<p>I figured out what I did wrong... the firmware I flashed into my tl-wr941nd had ipv6 enabled and I didn&#039;t include ipv6 in my last compilation... last night I conpiled with ipv6 enabled and the resultant firmware booted from uboot without problem... I was able to erase the &quot;firmware&quot; partition usinf mtd... </p><p>Great mtd is working now.. but unfortunatelly I made another mistake (agaaaaainn)... I compiled with target set, so I turned off my router and compiled openwrt again but with normal squashfs as target... but the router refuses to boot the previously image that I used (ramdisk one)...</p><p>so I&#039;m stuck with a router witout firmware (just with u-boot).... anyway, I just need to boot a minnmial openwrt to be able to restore the firmware through mtd..</p><p>I&#039;ll keep you posted</p>									</div>
