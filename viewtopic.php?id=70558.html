					<p>Does it work if you restart the miniDLNA service? Perhaps miniDLNA is scanning the disk containing the media before it gets mounted.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did several restart without solution. To works again I have to disable miniDLNA, save, turn off the system and turn on again and redo all steps to enable.</p><p>It return to work just while the system is on.

					<p>I think eduperez is correct in whats going on because I had the same problem, here&#039;s what I do for my minidlna server, I get minidlna set up to where it&#039;s working and serving media, then in Luci I go to System&gt;Startup and disable minidlna, don&#039;t disable it from the minidlna settings page, only disable from the Startup page, then in Local Startup (bottom of startup page) I put commands to mount my drive and start minidlna, so something like this - </p><p>sleep 5<br />mount /dev/sda1 -o rw,async<br />/etc/init.d/minidlna start</p><p>Change specifics for your needs of course, this way the drive will be mounted before minidlna starts and it will be able to see the files.</p>									</div>

					<p>When you said &quot;I am using the OpenWrt on my new device: Zappit One 4K&quot;, I understood you had installed OpenWRT on it. Now, is the miniDLNA server running on that device? Or is it running in another device (hopefully running OpenWRT)?</p>									</div>

					<p>the drive is probably not mounted when minidlna service is started. some usb drives have this issue, some of them not.</p><p>one solution for this is mount the drive as extroot since AA the device waits for the extroot to mount before starting the services.</p><p>or read this: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/fstab#sleep_before_startup">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/fstab# … re_startup</a></p><p>look for &quot;Wait for mount is done&quot; and follow the steps there.</p><p>or you can just file a complaint for the manufacturer and fix the issue with late drive mounting issue with the affected product.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 14 Apr 2017, 13:48)</p>

					<p>SOLVED.</p><p>I would thank the all suggestions, mainly from eduperez and nxtd. The solution is quite simple, but I lose some time because you must follow strict the command, without uppercase and with blank space. Total instruction is:</p><p>Go to Luci<br />System&gt;Startup<br />disable minidlna, don&#039;t disable it from the minidlna settings page, only disable from the Startup page<br />Go to Local Startup (bottom of startup page) and put commands to mount the drive and start minidlna</p><p>The command in my case is:</p><p>sleep 5<br />mount /dev/sda2 -o rw,async<br />/etc/init.d/minidlna start<br />exit 0</p><p>Again, all of you are an outstanding. Very thanks</p>									</div>
