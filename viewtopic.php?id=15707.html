					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I recently switched from DSL (PPPoE) to cable (DHCP), and changed the config in /etc/config/network accordingly.</p><p>My problem is, that udhcpc now runs as daemon to get the public IP address via dhcp. Although the lease time is 95 days (I sniffed some dhcp packets and took a look at them), it thinks that the lease time is only 3600 seconds, requesting/reconfirming the public IP address every hour. This is very annoying.</p><p>Is there a way to fix this behaviour? Is there perhaps a standard dhcpcd or dhclient package in a repository?</p><p>As a workaround I killed the dhcp process and requestes an IP via udhcpd by hand, telling it to quit after it optained a lease. Problem is now, that the router might loose it internet connection, when the lease expires</p>									</div>
