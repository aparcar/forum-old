					<p>Hi all</p><p>I have a power supply delivering different voltages, and in facts, the WRT seems to be able to run at only 4.5V and still 1 A current intensity. I am wondering if anyone has the same phenomenon with its machine. If so, why does linksys provide a 12V/1A power unit ?</p><p>If it works fine, and I believe it does, it would be great to make solar and/or wind autonomous units.</p><p>Thanks for your answers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t have the total schematic but there is documentation of the 1501-33 power regulator that is in my wrt54G V2.<br />See: <a href="http://www.anachip.com/downloads/datasheets/power/sw_reg/AP1501.pdf">http://www.anachip.com/downloads/datash … AP1501.pdf</a><br />With very few external components this switch-mode buck converting power supply IC can downconvert voltages and deliver up to 3 Ampere at 3.3 V. It integrates the regulating circuitry and the power transistor<br />Question is whether the raw input voltage is still also used somewhere in the WRT54G; don&#039;t know and don&#039;t fancy probing all those little solder pads, risking short circuit. But if it is not, it explains why the input voltage is not critical as long as the regulator circuit gets enough to function. The datasheet of the 3.3V IC version states that minimum input voltage should be 4.75 V ! They must have chosen a 12 V raw supply just to work with lower input currents and have less ohmic losses, or perhaps just because 12 V is the most popular and cost effective.<br />Don&#039;t understand the constant current that you see. Would expect a constant power (consumption of the circuits plus losses), i.e. input current inversely proportional to voltage at the input. But many current meters don&#039;t see the higher harmonics.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 30 Jul 2005, 21:38)</p>

					<p>I measured power consumption (including power supply losses) of Linksys WRT54G v2.0 (with ADM multiplexer) and WRT54GS v1.1 (with Broadcom multiplexer).

					<p>Experience here is that as long as above the minimum voltage of appr. 7V and under the max. voltage the power supply IC in the WRT can handle (more than 20), anything goes as long as the product of external voltage and external current is at least 4-5 W for each wrt54gl.<br />A very reliable way of power supply is from a power supply with 13.6 V output (15V regulator IC with two diodes in series from regulator ground to real ground) that supplies one or more wrts and parallel to that a dry lead-gel battery. The battery is connected to the supply and wrts via a 10 ohm resistor that has a diode in parallel. When external power is gone the battery supplies the wrts via the diode. When external power returns but the battery would by then be empty, the resistor limits charging current thus leaving enough voltage for the wrts to start (empty batteries are effectively a short circuit). Without external power the battery only supplies the wrts because the regulator IC output circuit can only deliver but not sink current, so no diode needed there.<br />Very simple and hence reliable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 26 Nov 2006, 16:57)</p>

					<p>Hello hemshia....wit regards to ur query, the adapter if not connected to any device doesnot consume any electricity. It is as good as a disconneted circuit. Only in case of a four quadrant adapter i.e. if theres any lamp on the adapter which glows while it is on, a minimal electricity is consumed.</p><p>For any further queries visit <a href="http://www.electricitychamp.com">www.electricitychamp.com</a></p>									</div>
