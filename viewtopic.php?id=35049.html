					<p>Poor thing!</p><p>All was well, router installed with Openwrt and then Luci via command line (opkg install etc).<br />Luci worked well, wireless configured and connected as a wireless client.<br />On restart though, when I go to the router IP in a web browser, I see the white on black &#039;luci configuration interface&#039; pop up briefly, then a blank white page - no login, nothing. page source code is blank. Same in Chrome and Firefox.</p><p>Using the TOP command, I can see a uhttpd process running.</p><p>I did issue the commands /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable and /etc/init.d/uhttpd start when I installed, I can see uhttpd in the init.d directory</p><p>My only &#039;custom&#039; change is to put a stty command in the rc.local file to enable a little serial board i have attached (previously all working fine on another openwrt router)</p><p>Power cycling doesnt clear the problem- but the router is otherwise ok (ping, pass traffic, ssh etc)</p><p>Any thoughts as to what I may have done and how to repair? Im more keen to understand what I did wrong!</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>you might just need to empty the cache. luci acts very strangely when you don&#039;t do that before a new build</p>									</div>

I was referring to emptying your browser&#039;s cache. It should be nothing to do with your router itself. My advice is solely aimed towards your browsers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>housesmaster</strong> on 27 Feb 2012, 20:44)</p>
