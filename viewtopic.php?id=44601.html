					<p>Dear All,</p><p>Since I upgraded my TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v1 to OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1) I entered the following problem<br />I can access all my services or devices from my LAN and from my WAN IP.<br />But when I want to access a device from my LAN with my WAN IP it got a time out.<br />Normaly this is not a problem but some programs do not allow to enter a WAN and LAN IP.<br />Furthermore it becomes anoying to switch all the time to LAN or WAN IP when I want to access one of my devices.</p><p>So the situation for my cam is now as follows<br />Lan router :192.168.2.1<br />Lan IP cam: 192.168.2.13:7501<br />WAN: mydomain.no-ip.org</p><p>In my router&nbsp; I forwarded port 7501 to 192.168.2.13:7501<br />When I want to access my cam from WAN I enter<br />mydomain.no-ip.org:7501 and voila there is my cam.</p><p>But when I try to access my cam from my LAN I cannot use mydomain.no-ip.org:7501(only via the direct LAN IP)</p><p>With the previous version of OpenWrt I was able to access my devices by my WAN and LAN ip when I was connected to my LAN.</p><p>I assume I have to add a route or something.<br />Can someone help me out</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok I found two older topics<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=109259#p109259">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 59#p109259</a><br />and<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=190905#p190905">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 05#p190905</a></p><p>The last one simply describes unchecking &quot;Discard upstream RFC1918 responses&quot;<br />But unfortunately this doesn´t work</p><p>Regarding the first topic I cant figure out where to add the extra line, I hope someone can tell me more how to implement this</p>									</div>
