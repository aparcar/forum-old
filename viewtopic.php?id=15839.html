					<p>I am using a WRT54G v4 with openWRT Kamikaze 7.09 as a DNS server, because the WAN port is broken and I have no reason to use it as a router, but I do have a need/want for a server.&nbsp; I would like to add another interface to it for a mail server, and have it on the LAN ports.&nbsp; I would like to have one interface called &quot;dns&quot; with the ip 192.168.1.1 and another interface called &quot;mail&quot; with the ip 192.168.1.3. Please don;t ask why I have chosen those ip&#039;s, they just work with my setup!&nbsp; how do I do this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Do these services have to actually be on different ports? If not, then you can use IP Aliases to set up both addresses, and have the DNS server only listen to ...1 and the mail server only listen to ...3 - you could even use iptables to enforce those restrictions, but that seems like overkill.</p>									</div>
