					<p>Has anybody, really, managed to get mpd to decode AAC radio streams<br />I can get mini-mpd to decode ogg radio paradise, mpd-full just stutters ..<br />there&#039;s lots of chatter about floating point disable, soft point etc - but I am confused by it all.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I enable AAC decode in mpd-mini makefile, it basically turns mpd-mini back into a bloated mpd and AAC still stuttering</p><p>So can anybody get it to work?&nbsp; Is it possible on a Orange Livebox with memory upgrade??</p><p>paradise mp3 by the way plays beautifully with attitude stable, even with the trunk.</p>									</div>

					<p>A short answer to the floatingpoint topic:<br />most CPUs used in routers don&#039;t have hardware-floatingpointunits, and for network stuff you don&#039;t need it anyway. So if you run code with floatingpoint operations (and most audio/videos-codecs do) the system have to emulate a&nbsp; FPU (=softfloatingpoint) with really bad performance. So the best way is to run codecs which only use fixedpoint-operations. <br />For ogg you have the codec tremor and for mp3 you got libmad as fixedpoint-implementation. <br />For aac (faad2) seems to be some build option to compile it as fixedpoint-codec.<br />In AA faad2 is compiled with floatingpoint support, but there is a <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/34527">changeset</a> in trunk, so faad2 should be fixedpoint-code there.<br />So try trunk, or apply the changeset to AA, and make sure you compile mpd-mini (with tremor, libmad and faad2). mpd-full uses vorbis-codec for ogg (floatingpoint-implementation)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 9 Mar 2013, 09:13)</p>
