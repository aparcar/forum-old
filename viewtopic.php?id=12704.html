					<p>I was wondering if anyone else had seen the problem I&#039;m having :</p><p>On Gateworks Avila boards I&#039;m running 7.07. Mostly everything works<br />perfectly. However once in a while, after boot up the Ethernet interface<br />doesn&#039;t work. By that I mean that I am unable to successfully arp<br />either in or out. Wireless interfaces continue to work ok. Then, without<br />changing any config whatsoever, I can reboot the board and find that<br />eth0 is working ok. Once it gets into the &#039;broken&#039; state it seems to need<br />a power cycle to cure it. I don&#039;t see anything strange in dmesg<br />or from ifconfig when it&#039;s broken. Everything looks fine, it just doesn&#039;t<br />transmit any packets after the boot is finished. ifconfig usually<br />shows a few packets tx, but the count never increases.<br />I&#039;ve used tcpdump to determine that the kernel isn&#039;t doing something<br />crazy like transmit the arp responses on the wrong interface.<br />I&#039;ve removed the openwrt bridge configuration (sysctl directives<br />that disable arp). </p><p>As I said above, the boards work 90% of the time, so I am suspecting<br />some race condition in the driver initialization. The hardware has two<br />ethernet ports but I&#039;m only using one. </p><p>Thanks for any pointers.</p>									</div>
