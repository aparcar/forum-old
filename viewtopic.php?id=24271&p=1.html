					<p>Hi all!</p><p>Now with backfire trunk, we have partial support on Broadcomm 63xx chips. I&#039;d like to work on adsl line. Is there any tech doc I can access (googled it without luck)?</p><p>All he have at now is binary code to be reversed?</p><p>I have a lot of AG241 (linksys AR7) working, and I need a substitutive all in one router with an affordable cost. So I can make some effort on 63xx adsl supporting. But first of all I&#039;d like to know if there&#039;s someone else working on this. I have previous experience on net drivers writing so with a tech doc it&#039;s only a &quot;seat &amp; code&quot; matter. If I have to reverse BC binary it could take a longer effort.</p><p>Best Regards.</p>									</div>

That&#039;s right. I think a lot of new adsl routers are broadcom based, so it would be amazing if we work a little on make it work. If I need to buy a modem for connect an adsl router to inet it&#039;s a little nonsense. I prefer making an effort on this than live buying used ag241 routers on ebay.<br />And I prefer develop adsl driver for OpenWRT better than OpenVPN support for stock firmware</p>									</div>

					<p>Apop:</p><p>I doubt that a clean room attempt would work in this case because that would depend on a clear view and understanding of the chip internals, which you don&#039;t have.</p><p>Yes; ADSL is a standard but the implementation is very complex and troublesome. That is why there are no &quot;free&quot; implementations.</p><p>Broadcom has many patents including some primary ones on ADSL.
