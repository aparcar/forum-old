					<p>Hi all,</p><p>just received 3pcs of Ubquiti´s Airrouter. It has ar7241 chipset and i can´t really get it to work. With bullet-m-image at least i got an ip (192.186.1.1) on the wan port and can telnet to the device, but the lan is on the wan port and wan is missing... What i found so far:<br /><a href="http://patchwork.ozo.com/patch/567/">http://patchwork.ozo.com/patch/567/</a><br />but that didn´t work.<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/23132">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/23132</a><br />suggests to me the second interface should be known?!</p><p>What needs to be done to add support for this device to OpenWRT? It has UART pins and i have a TTL converter so i can do testing but need directions on what to do/try...</p><p>Regards <br />Gregor</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>glahue</strong> on 9 Aug 2011, 23:42)</p>

					<p>Hm, a friend found out that an image from the snapshots-directory of openwrt for ubnt-nano-m works almost perfectly out of the box whereas a custom compiled image of trunk for the same target doesn´t work. I don´t think i changed anything relevant in make menuconfig besides choosing the target system (ar71xx) and target profile (ubiquiti products). We´re stuck in finding out what is done differently producing the precompiled images. Anyone a clue?</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>What version is that snapshot, and which version is your custom image? If they differ, then you could pull the snapshot version and try that. Besides that it would help a lot get to know what is not working (compiling/booting), so providing the logs with your errors would be necessary.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for all your support, i found out it all were only configuration issues. Building without a firewall i got access to the wan port (the only one that was configured out of the box), from there everything was easy.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Povi,</p><p>i have a custom OpenWRT Trunk image running on our airrouters, but honestly i can´t recall what i did to make it work :-D<br />I tried in vain with backfire, and think it worked out of the box with a trunk buildroot, but i can´t see any *-ubnt-airrouter-* image in <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a> as i do in my own buildroot :-/<br />Try building trunk yourself and if it doesn´t work come back and post, ok?</p><p>Regards<br />Gregor</p><p>--<br />Partykeller<br /><a href="http://www.meineparty.at">www.meineparty.at</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Serial port is working, tried with old Siemens mobile phone cable.<br />Installed DD-WRT easely, didn&#039;t like activation, put OpenWRT on. A bit scary, it doesn&#039;t respond at first, but you reset it once more and it is done. I have a feeling that AirRouter will be my favorite router. It couldn&#039;t NAT thru full 100Mbps with AirOS or DD-WRT, but it did 91. Now need to rest, will continue trolling later <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />If I am not mistaking, I used <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-jffs2-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a></p>									</div>
