					<p>I bought a bunch of used 703&#039;s on ebay from a seller who kept getting them back as returns. They are all running the following openwrt firmware/software.<br />Problem is, trying to convert them back to standard openwrt so I can then use my own Image Builder build simply keeps bricking the units. Once they are sysupgraded, they always die. I re-power the units, they blink the LED once and that&#039;s it, nothing more from it. It doesn&#039;t try to get a DHCP address, doesn&#039;t set it&#039;s own address, it&#039;s just gone. </p><p>So far, I had done the upgrade using the my own sysupgrade and factory file. Both killed the device. I then used a default factory build mentioned in the wiki (can&#039;t recall which though, should have kept better track) and that just killed another one.</p><p>I&#039;m using the image builder with pre-built images to make my own build. The build works perfectly on new devices which come with the Chinese firmware. With those, I use the web interface to upload a &#039;factory&#039; build, then I install my own build. I have not had one problem with my builds or using factory found in the wiki.</p><p>Then I found original firmware to put it back to tp-link, did the upgrade and got myself another bricked unit.<br />I used the following file;</p><p>WR703N_CH_MR3020Nv1_EN_up(120320)_Webflash.bin</p><p>Which was inside of the following zip;<br />Original TP-LINK TL-WR703N (Chinese version).zip</p><p>Said to be the original firmware file for the 703n.</p><p>Which I found here;</p><p><a href="http://www.siongboon.com/projects/2013-10-06_tl-wr703n_setup/index.html">http://www.siongboon.com/projects/2013- … index.html</a></p><p>Then someone ask if it would make more sense to use something directly from tp-link but they no longer seem to support this unit and I wasn&#039;t able to find any files for it.</p><p>I took the bricked ones apart and they are all v1.6. At least, there is a sticker on the Ethernet port which says 1.6.<br />All of them were running Bleeding Edge r38816. Hardware wise, sticker wise, they all look the same between NEW and the used ones I bought.</p><p>I found some additional info on the running openwrt device.</p><p>/tmp/sysinfo</p><p>board_name: tl-wr703n<br />model: TP-LINK TL-WR703N V1</p><p>What&#039;s the V1 mean?</p><p>Then in /etc</p><p>in a file called avalon_version<br />20131229<br />cgminer: 698d677<br />cgminer-openwrt-packages: aadd747+<br />luci: 346e3e7+</p><p>Looking on the net, this is a bit beyond me again.

If it was clear I was doing something wrong, ok, but, I&#039;ve spent hours reading and cannot confirm anything.</p><p>At this point, I&#039;ve bricked six units total and I&#039;m pretty confused about what is going on now.</p><p>In terms of building, I&#039;m not doing anything all that special and my builds work on all new devices.</p><p>make image PROFILE=TLWR703 PACKAGES=&quot;at sysstat bash mtr curl kmod-ipv6 -dnsmasq -kmod-ath9k -kmod-usb-core -kmod-usb2 -uboot-envtools -wpa<br />d-mini&quot; FILES=files/</p><p>Tried to build using the latest 14.7... Dead, just like the others. They don&#039;t even go into any kind of rescue mode. I&#039;ve tried everything I can find. That same build works fine on all of the units I bought NEW because I tried upgrading some this morning and all went fine.</p><p>After I flashed it with 14.7, it lights the LED once then nothing else.<br />I did my build using the image builder and the command shown above.</p><p>I used the following file to upgrade.</p><p>3932160 Nov&nbsp; 6 15:54 openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin</p><p>The builder I am using is from;<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … x/generic/</a></p><p>The file I am using is;</p><p>barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-ar71xx_generic-for-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2</p><p>Here is /proc/mtd</p><p># cat /proc/mtd<br />dev:&nbsp; &nbsp; size&nbsp; &nbsp;erasesize&nbsp; name<br />mtd0: 00020000 00010000 &quot;u-boot&quot;<br />mtd1: 000f8910 00010000 &quot;kernel&quot;<br />mtd2: 002d76f0 00010000 &quot;rootfs&quot;<br />mtd3: 000b0000 00010000 &quot;rootfs_data&quot;<br />mtd4: 00010000 00010000 &quot;art&quot;<br />mtd5: 003d0000 00010000 &quot;firmware&quot;</p><p>Help!!!!</p>									</div>

					<p>That is rather interesting since &quot;sysupgrade&quot; is actually just a collection of shell scripts and, in the end, using mtd itself.
