					<p>I bricked my MR3040 last evening also. Unfortunately, I have already written to tp-link tech support telling them that I had tried installing a custom firmware and they advised me to press the reset button, which I had done without any results and she said that beyond that, they may not be able to assist further. </p><p>I&#039;m trying to figure out how to flash the latest stock firmware back onto the device using the U-Boot technique. When I turn the router on, all I see is the power LED on and nothing more. There is no signal on the Ethernet port. How do I connect the modem to my laptop which does not have a serial port? Do I connect the modem&#039;s power/micro USB port to a USB port on my laptop (no device gets detected when I do that) or do I use the USB port on the modem and a USB port on my laptop? I have two USB-male Serial RS-232 cables and a female-female converter that can allow me to have a USB to Serial to USB cable (using this technique didn&#039;t show anything on putty either <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> ). Somebody please help...</p>									</div>

There is no &quot;USB TTL cable&quot; as itself. There are USB-serial converters (like those two I gave links to) that convert USB port easily to a TTL-level serial port, so that you can then connect the router with a serial cable (usually just 4 separate wires). But &quot;USB&quot; is used there just for connecting the converter to your PC. Talking about USB cables leads you into astray. (Some of the converters are marketed as USB-to-TTL, but it is just a USB-serial converter + serial cable).</p><p>As ar as I know, you need a 3.3V serial port.</p><p>An ancient &quot;Nokia cable&quot; is one such converter. But the key thing there is the built-in USB-serial conversion and then a normal serial cable from the converter to the phone (or router in this case). Much easier is to buy a small made-for-this converter.</p>									</div>

					<p>USB is to TTL serial what English is to Russian. DO NOT just poke random wires in!<br />Do as hnyman suggests, and get a proper cable/converter eg from the ebay links provided. Fiddling about with stuff randomly may well, in this case, break your router permanently.</p>									</div>
