					<p>I am dealing with pretty much the same problem. Mine is a c597(sierra wireless compas 597 usb). It has an auto driver load part that loads the driver automatically when plugged into windows. Theoretically, you have to use usb_modeswitch to get it to switch from the cd-rom emulation to the actually modem.</p><p><a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch">http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch</a></p><p>my modem is detected and loaded as /dev/usb/tts/0. but i can&#039;t talk to it and can&#039;t get usb_modeswitch to work with it. maybe you can have luck as your model is closer to what they have in the conf. openwrt has a package for 0.9.5. i hope they get a 0.9.6 package soon(or wish i could figure out how to get make to run on openwrt) because that version has a sierra setting built in now. my lsusb shows up with my modem being 0x1199:0x0fff when it should be :0x0023. Hope this helps you, but i think i&#039;m at a point where i need to just use my laptop to connect to the internet and pipe it into the router for wireless. which totally sucks.

					<p>not entirely sure what you mean. I have a feeling you are talking about compiling a image from scratch. A. no clue how to even start do to that. i read through the how to&#039;s and it was way over my head.

					<p>Sorry, BB, I was responding to watts, who in his first post referred to menuconfig.&nbsp; I have had limited success myself and know of no way to go about it when there are problems if you&#039;re not building your own image.&nbsp; I&#039;m using VMware on my Vista PC to run Ubuntu solely for the purpose of building Kamikaze--it&#039;s a clunky process, but doable, with persistance.</p>									</div>
