					<p>&gt;&gt;how is OpenWRT supposed to be able to reach a gateway outside the local subnet?</p><p>Well my question is exactly that! How to tell OpenWrt that the gateway IP is reachable on this interface, which is not in the DHCP defined subnet.<br />So basically you would want to tell OpenWrt that there are two different subnets reachable on this interface.</p><p>I saw, that there were various posts relating to this problem, or as said to a similar problem.</p><p>E.g. like</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19397">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=19397</a></p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22356">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22356</a></p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23283">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23283</a></p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20276">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=20276</a></p><p>So it seems it is a known problem.</p><p>Well actually as it seems, many DSL-Modem have such a strange way of &quot;IP passthrough&quot; which does exactly do that:<br />Deliver a WAN IP over DHCP, but defining the gateway as a local net address.</p><p>So there must be a solution...</p><p>As just with the info given by the DHCP of the DSL-Modem, OpenWrt is just giving out a &quot;destination unreachable&quot; error.</p><p>I tried defining a static route for this WAN interface 0.0.0.0/0 to gateway 192.168.2.1</p><p>But this route is never shown as active route in the status display, and I don&#039;t know why...<br />And it then also does (not surprisingly) not work.</p><p>My main goal is to get this DSL-WAN running on my OpenWrt Router, and then combine it with another WAN from a cable-modem for fall back...as the DSL connection quite often crashes...</p><p>I have no problem getting the cable modem running on OpenWrt, but I just cannot get the DSL-Modem running due to this strange &quot;IP passthrough&quot; mode.</p><p>So I really appreciate any help/hints for solving this problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mobbi</strong> on 14 Nov 2014, 19:58)</p>

					<p>I do not think it is a problem in OpenWRT at all, as it is receiving contradictory information; this looks to me like a bad configuration on the DSL-modem. Have you tried to plug a computer directly to the DSL-modem, and see if that works? How is the network configured in that machine?</p>									</div>

					<p>As said, many DSL Modems have this &quot;special&quot; mode which behaves exactly like that. And it also gives exactly this data to a PC, when it is connected instead of the router.</p><p>The problem is, as always, that you need to have the original DSL-Modem due to special constraints. E.g. especially here in Europe many providers started with this dumb thing, that you have to use their proprietary routers/modems, others will not work. And these routers do not have a bridge mode, so you need to use this &quot;IP passthrough&quot; mode.</p><p>Well basically the idea behind this special &quot;IP passthrough&quot; mode is clear:<br />Just one definable (by MAC address) special host in the local subnet (e.g. 192.168.2.0/24) of the modem is getting a WAN IP instead of a local IP. But as the modem still has the normal gateway IP in the local subnet (e.g. 192.168.2.1), the host with the WAN IP still has to forward it&#039;s packets to this IP, to be able to get them out.</p><p>That would basically be no problem, if one could somehow tell OpenWrt that the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 is also reachable on this interface and not just the WAN-subnet, as delivered by the DHCP of the modem.</p><p>But like that, it is obvious that OpenWrt is delivering a destination unreachable error, as it doesn&#039;t know, that it can reach this gateway on this interface, although the gateway is clearly shown in the ARP table...</p>									</div>

					<p>I insist that this seems like a bad behaviour on the DSL-Modem, I just do not understand how is any device expected to reach the internet when handled those parameters. Anyhow, you can try to force OpenWRT to use the wan interface to reach the gateway (just remember to change &quot;eth0.x&quot; to the actual name of the device on your router that is connected to the DSL-Modem):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0.x</code></pre></div>									</div>
