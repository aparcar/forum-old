					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to do something pretty simple (well at least it should?!?!) and after hours and hours of web searching and configuration attempts, I decided to post here...</p><p>I am using kamikaze 7.09 with a wrt54gl and linux kernel 2.6. I want to filter some packets (using a netfilter kernel module) that are exchanged between two ports of my router, these ports are configured in separate vlans and bridged together like this:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 1 5*&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;2 5&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan2&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;3 5&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config interface loopback<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;lo&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;127.0.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.0.0.0</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config interface test<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.1 eth0.2&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; none</p><p>As you can imagine, I have two computers plugged on ports 2 and 3. To make my debugging easy, I gave these computers a fixed ip address in the 192.168.2.XXX range.</p><p>I built a small kernel netfilter module with a PF_INET/NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING hook. For now, this hook simply uses printk to output the in interface name, the source ip address and the destination address of all the traffic on br-test.</p><p>On one of the computers, I start a ping of the other computer and I look at my kernel logs.</p><p>On my first attempt, the ping was going through successfully, but I was not able to see any traffic on this bridge interface. After a few research, I learned that by default the linux kernel will see only the traffic destined to the router and not the bridged traffic. I saw two options: using eptables and using bridge-nf. This last option seems simpler for my needs. So, as suggested in another post, I modified the file /target/linux/brcm47xx/config-2.6.23 and added CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=y</p><p>I rebuilt my kernel and now with the same network configuration and kernel module, I see all the expected traffic on br-test, but the request does not reach the remote host, i.e. the sender of the ping reports &quot;Request timed out&quot;, and the receiver of the ping does not show anything in a network trace.</p><p>What am I missing?</p><p>Thanks in advance, hope I&#039;ve been clear enough!</p><p>Seb</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry if this is obvious, but have you checked the default policy for forwarding is not DROP? or you have a last rule that does a DROP/REJECT? I&#039;m not sure what chains bridge packets go through, but it sounds like whichever one it does is dropping the packets.</p>									</div>

					<p>The obvious was... well... obvious <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Doing iptables -L -v, I saw lots of packets being dropped by the FORWARD policy (the default policy is DROP for this chain). I didn&#039;t even think at looking there as it was working before activating bridge-nf, but now that the packets are handled by netfilter, it all makes sense.</p><p>I simply added a rule to the forwarding_rule chain to ACCEPT everything on br-test and surprise, it works!</p><p>Thanks a lot for your answer!
