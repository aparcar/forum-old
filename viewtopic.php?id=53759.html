					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>yesterday i had to move some files from my notebook to my main pc. <br />I transfered about 150gb within my network. </p><p>But i have a question about the speed. I could reach about 80mbit/s with openwrt barrierbreaker 14.07.<br />So i started asking myself about the speed and found some topics about the hardware nat function.</p><p>Is the hardware nat function working in the latest openwrt with my router wdr3600? <br />How is the file transfering speed (80mbit/s) ? Could this be faster? Is there a possibilty that my cable is choking my speed ?</p><p>I would love to see some ideas about what i can do to increase my network speed.<br />I hope those &#039;newbie&#039; questions are fine.</p><p>And thanks for doing this awesome work.</p><p>Edit: Jperf log: <a href="http://pastebin.com/8AxDJZuf">http://pastebin.com/8AxDJZuf</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>varity</strong> on 2 Nov 2014, 16:00)</p>

					<p>If you&#039;re transferring inside your LAN, NAT is not involved, and hardware NAT wouldn&#039;t make any difference.</p><p>But to answer your question directly, no, openwrt does not currently utilize hardware nat acceleration.</p><p>For wired-to-wired configuration, if either the laptop or the PC are running at 100Mbit (vs Gigabit) then 80Mbit would be right about the speed you would normally see for transfers.</p><p>Since you mentioned a laptop, I will take a guess that you are using wireless for the transfer, and many more things can make a difference in transfer speed over wireless (2.4Ghz vs 5Ghz, HT20 vs HT40, laptop MIMO/config, range, channel selection, congestion/interference, etc).</p>									</div>
