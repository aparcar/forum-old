					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I have a WR1043ND, using Alfa AWUS036H with 5dbi omni-directional antenna to connect as a station to a WPA2-Enterprise wireless (in this case, the &#039;eduroam&#039; wireless service). I am, I suspect, approximately 400 feet from where the access point i&#039;m connecting to is located (but I really don&#039;t know for sure - it&#039;s close, anyway). I&#039;m currently running Backfire 10.03.1-RC5.</p><p>The connection is stable:</p><p>wlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IEEE 802.11bg&nbsp; ESSID:&quot;eduroam&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode:Managed&nbsp; Frequency:2.462 GHz&nbsp; Access Point: 00:3A:98:##:##:##<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate=54 Mb/s&nbsp; &nbsp;Tx-Power=30 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RTS thr:off&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption key:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power Management:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link Quality=53/70&nbsp; Signal level=-57 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx invalid nwid:0&nbsp; Rx invalid crypt:0&nbsp; Rx invalid frag:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx excessive retries:0&nbsp; Invalid misc:0&nbsp; &nbsp;Missed beacon:0</p><p>Link and Signal levels fluctuate between the -50s, but it&#039;s stable. Bit-rate can go up and down, but largely it reports that its at 48 or 54 Mb/s.</p><p>Here is where the problem begins: the internet is dog slow. I get, at average, around 1 Mb/s download and about 2-3 Mb/s upload (tested using speedtest.net). I was scratching my head to figure out why, when I noticed the noise level on the Luci web interface was reporting a noise level of -36db... which, I suspect, is unusually &#039;high&#039;.</p><p>The wifi traffic in this area is quite busy - I can pick up anywhere between 20-40 aps. I also live in (and around) student blocks with various, poorly maintained (ie. plenty of BT Openzones being thrown out to crowd traffic) wireless routers (and, knowing from my own building, a fair few microwaves!) The adapter is attached to my window. I also live on a busy seafront, so traffic can be fairly busy (and I have no idea on the effects of ferious welsh sea winds on wireless signals, tongue)</p><p>Am I right in assuming that the noise level is what&#039;s behind my slow speed? Eduroam is *fast*, I know I should be getting, at least, somewhat better speeds based on my signal level. If the noise level is the case, any ideas on what I can do to solve this? I assume a directional antenna might be of some worth (and something I&#039;ll definitely consider if it&#039;ll help) but is there anything else I can do to &#039;lower&#039; the noise level and get a better connection?</p><p>EDIT: I thought it was a little odd that the noise level remained statically at -36db... so I checked:</p><br /><p>wlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ESSID: &quot;eduroam&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Access Point: 00:3A:98:##:##:##<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Type: nl80211&nbsp; HW Mode(s): 802.11bg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode: Client&nbsp; Channel: 11 (2.462 GHz)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tx-Power: 30 dBm&nbsp; Link Quality: 53/70<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Signal: -57 dBm&nbsp; Noise: ? dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate: 48.0 MBit/s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption: WPA2 802.1X (NONE)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supports VAPs: no</p><p>Guessing that reporting of the noise level is borked for this driver (it&#039;s an RTL8187). For wlan0 (the WR1043ND&#039;s main wireless) transmitting under eduroam, it reports a noise level of -95db... which seems alot better. So I&#039;m torn, and have no idea what might be causing my slow internet.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanks all,</p><p>Sovvy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sovvy</strong> on 11 Nov 2011, 22:48)</p>

					<p>Wifi speeds up at the main campus are fairly good, anything between 15-30 MB/s or more. over LAN, even better - the connections are over the JANET academic network. The uni have deployed various eduroam repeaters throughout the town for students to pick up; it&#039;s either one of these i&#039;m picking up, or it&#039;s an access point from one of the uni buildings just down the road.</p><p>In this case, I&#039;ll take my phone, find the specific AP and try and pinpoint where the AP is, and what speeds I can get from it</p>									</div>

					<p>Not much better at this location, i&#039;m afraid. I tried both with my desktop (running Windows 7) and my laptop running lubuntu 11.10, very little difference either way, really. It&#039;s strange - It could be that I just don&#039;t have as good a connection as it appears I do; for instance, inSSIDer on Windows tells me that there is a delay (for lack of a better word) in when my PC &#039;last sees&#039; the ap i&#039;m connecting to; anywhere between 4-5 seconds, sometimes slightly longer. In contrast, nearer APs maintain &#039;contact&#039; every second. I&#039;m afraid i&#039;m no expert, so I can&#039;t tell if there is any significance in this.</p><p>As for what you&#039;ve suggested, I don&#039;t really know. It&#039;s possible - I may just email my universities information services department and see what information I can drag out of them</p>									</div>

					<p>I think at best you can do is to get a bigger directional antenna. 5dBi is too small for such distance.</p><p>BTW, have you tried fixed 802.11b mode instead of 802.11bg mode?</p><p>Secondly, next time you shouldn&#039;t get such a 1W high power WIFI adapter which enhances both transmission and also <strong>noise</strong>. Instead, you should get a mid-power, 100-200mW or 20-23dBm, WIFI adapter plus a high gain directional antenna which is the right way to extend range.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I was strongly considering a directional antenna - alot of the AP&#039;s i&#039;m picking up are originating from &#039;behind&#039; the omni - from my building and the surrounding ones. I&#039;m looking at purchasing either a 7 or 9 dBi directional antenna (http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000N9B66U or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0041SLFLA)">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0041SLFLA)</a> - would there be much difference between them?</p><p>Indeed, I think I was wow&#039;d by the reviews of the device more than anything, and hearsay regarding performance. If noise is an issue (I&#039;m still not entirely sure what the noise level is, I&#039;ve got no real accurate reporting - will investigate that), if I decide to lower the txpower, will it balance it out effectively?</p><p>Thanks for your help so far! I&#039;ve also emailed my uni&#039;s information services department to see if they can give me any guidance on ideal speed and a rough location of that specific AP. I won&#039;t hold out much hope - I&#039;ll investigate when I&#039;ve got half an hour spare with my phone to try and pinpoint it down.</p>									</div>

					<p>oh: regarding 801.11b mode, I edited /etc/config/wireless to force 11b, but it didn&#039;t work. When wlan1 came back up, it was still using 11bg. Not sure why!</p><p>I&#039;ve decided to go for the TP-link 9dBi antenna - reviews seem better, and an outdoor antenna is ideal - my windows tend to get quite damp, sadly!

					<p>I think you need more than 9dBi. But the most important thing is, you must be able to &quot;see&quot; the campus AP &quot;at sight&quot; otherwise you won&#039;t get any good of the directional antenna. Maybe even worse.</p><p>Try 802.11b from your laptop. The output power in b mode is at least x2 higher than g mode. That is to say, 1W is for b mode only.</p><p><a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/Calculator/">Wireless Calculator - Welcome to TP-LINK</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fyi</strong> on 13 Nov 2011, 15:21)</p>

					<p>Odd thing is, it&#039;s stable alot of the time. I&#039;m getting very good signal quality, and right now there&#039;s no drop in the adapter seeing the AP. The uni deployed AP&#039;s across the town, so it could be that this specific one is somewhere other than where I think it is (as in, it&#039;s closer); hopefully, I can pinpoint it down, that or my uni can give me some idea as to where abouts it is.</p><p>I&#039;ll see how well the 9dBi directional holds up - I can always send it back if it doesn&#039;t do the job and think of another solution!</p>									</div>
