					<p>Hey all</p><p>Im after a cheap DLink615, mainly to be used as a WIFI Hotspot at home, and when Im abroad (Family) to use it as a WIFI repeater..</p><br /><p>From the supported matrix C1/C1 are the best and I&#039;ve done some digging around on ebay and nearly all of them are either E1-4 or D2/D4..</p><p>I think the E4 one I found is best as it supports backfire, but wondering is it being upgraded to AA?<br />Also Ive found a lot of D2/D4s, but shying away from them as they require manual builds not totally working etc.. </p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Angelo</p>									</div>
