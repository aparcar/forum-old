A proof a concepts. A means for users to verify their bugs on something that&#039;s much closer to upstream (linux). A basis for bisecting kernel bugs. A play ground for own experiments.

					<p>Kaloz is the platform maintainer, so calling them semi-official is certainly ok and they are based on the stable branch so the placement isn&#039;t wrong, also a 15.05.2 release would replace them.</p><p>Far more important than kernel version is that those images are usable by the new v2 models and that others can use them as a stable branch build with recent mwlwifi.</p>									</div>
