					<p>When you say the router isn&#039;t working, what specifically is not not working? Ping response, configuration, Luci or SSH?</p><p>Did you compile a flash or just flash the trunk snapshot? If you flashed a trunk, most likely the Luci web user interface is incomplete and needs packages added to it to work but you should still be able to get an INTERNET connection unless that needs configuring also.</p><p>BTW, to get back to recovery flash, set your PC to static address range 192.168.0.1, subnet 255.255.255.0, cycle the power router (do not hold reset down yet), then hold reset button until power LED flashes. Then navigate your PC to 192.168.0.1 and flash. The 30-30-30 hard reset before and after a flash is a good practice to follow just remember to cycle it once more to reset for flash recovery and after flash to cycle modem and router and power/ready modem before applying power to router.</p><p>May I ask what prompted you to use the backup loader flash? I think the one to use is the squashfs.bin I tried to search it but didn&#039;t find it but I think that trunk snapshot is very similar to the DIR-615-C1. Mine requires Luci packages to be added in TELNET or SSH (along with an active INTERNET session) in order to utilize the Web user interface for configuration.</p><p>OpenWrt is excellent f/w, I suggest you do some reading and get it working like you need it; it would be worth the effort in the end. For a short list of Luci packages required, you can review my posts. Mine range from noob questions to beginner success but no compiling or advanced configuration (Ignore the posts about using Notepad++ to modify the flash&#039;s device ID). Despite the lack of flash space, my DIR-615 is a good wired router. It serves my multiple home devices efficiently and I&#039;ve heard it works very well as a wireless router but I prefer to run wires rather than tinker with placement for signal strength.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>armchair</strong> on 28 Feb 2010, 10:00)</p>
