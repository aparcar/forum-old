					<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>I would like to apply the cttproxy patch to the kernel, and build its module for openwrt.&nbsp; I am not sure exactly how this is done. </p><p>I can use the buildroot environment to build a firmware using two simple make commands.&nbsp; If I then go into buildroot/build_mipsel/linux, I can cleanly apply the patches for the 2.4.29 kernel.&nbsp; Do I simply need to run make again to re-build the firmware, or do I need to run some sort of &#039;make clean&#039; first?</p><p>I also noticed the patch-kernel.sh script in the scripts folder.&nbsp; Is this script called by the build process?&nbsp; Can I just create a folder called kernel-patches in the buildroot folder and dump my patches there?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want to apply a kernel patch while compiling, you have to place your patch in :</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>buildroot/package/linux/kernel-patches/</code></pre></div><p>You also have to give it a number and a name, for example : the last applied is 600-linux-squashfs-lzma because it requires the other to be applied first for instance.</p><p>Just remove once the kernel source, and then make distclean, and finally make should patch your kernel everytime you need it to be build.</p>									</div>
