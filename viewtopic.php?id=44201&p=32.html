My wireless AC client was a Macbook Air 13 (2014). I think it supports 2 streams, but since Apple doesn&#039;t mention that in the specs, I&#039;m not certain. My router runs Chaos Calmer - however, I updated the firmware from 10.2.4.45 to 10.2.4.48, so that might have a small impact, too. Tests were done in the same room as the router at approx. 5m distance. I used iperf3 without any manual window/segment size adjustments.</p><p>Anyway, here are the results:</p><p>The maximum throughput I could get on the Macbook was:<br />~270Mbit/s </p><p>However, the results depend on how you test. This best value was achieved when the iperf3 server was running on a desktop computer with a wired gigabit ethernet connection. The Macbook connects as a client.<br />If I let the iperf3 server run on the OpenWrt router itself, though, the maximum I could get was was a bit lower, between 230-240Mbit/s.</p><p>Another thing I noticed: Due to DFS, my router switches channel from time to time. When the router does that, I sometimes end up on an apparently more jammed channel and the throughput drops to 120-130Mbps. So, in order to see what kind of performance to expect under ideal conditions, I would recommend to repeat the tests on different channels or use a channel that doesn&#039;t require DFS and stays fixed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 23 Dec 2015, 00:03)</p>

My wireless AC client was a Macbook Air 13 (2014). I think it supports 2 streams, but since Apple doesn&#039;t mention that in the specs, I&#039;m not certain. My router runs Chaos Calmer - however, I updated the firmware from 10.2.4.45 to 10.2.4.48, so that might have a small impact, too. Tests were done in the same room as the router at approx. 5m distance. I used iperf3 without any manual window/segment size adjustments.</p><p>Anyway, here are the results:</p><p>The maximum throughput I could get on the Macbook was:<br />~270Mbit/s</p></blockquote></div><p>I stand corrected. I ran a few more tests and realized that I made a stupid mistake. I used a USB gigabit ethernet adaptor on the wired computer when I ran the tests with the MacBook. I didn&#039;t realize that I had used a USB 2.0 port instead of USB 3.0 which is why the resulting speed was lower than the actual maximum.</p><p>So, I redid the tests today and the MacBook now shows a throughput of <strong>430-450Mbit/s</strong>! That&#039;s more than enough for me. But it also shows that 150MBit/s on a client with 2 streams is quite low.</p>									</div>
