					<p>I just set WDS between two openwrt routers. Very impressed; performance is far better than my previous Edimax bridge and setup was painless.</p><p>I now have a problem. I don&#039;t know how to reach the WDS client to turn off WDS as now I don&#039;t know it&#039;s IP address. The hostname no longer works. Neither can I find any entries in the WDS AP lists.</p><p>How would I got about finding the IP address of the WDS client?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the similar problem.</p><p>Main router(not openwrt) also is dhcp server and gateway server.<br />RouterA(openwrt), dhcp client, ethernet direct connect to Main router, and WDS AP.<br />RouterB(openwrt), dhcp client, WDS client, connect to RouterA, ethernet connect to computer.<br />Using openwrt truck (r30xxx), everything work fine, RouterA &amp; B, B side&#039;s computer can get IP from Main router and have internet access.</p><p>By update to latest trunk (r31xxx).<br />routerB WDS connected to routerA, but cannot get IP from main router.<br />Even routerB use static IP also cannot communicate with routerA, but wifi WDS still connected.<br />However any wifi client (such as smartphone) connect to routerA can get IP and have internet connection.<br />routerB WDS client mode not working.<br />But, routerA revert back to old trunk, WDS work immediately.</p><p>I believe the settings are correct, but not work in new trunk.<br />And I believe the problem in on WDS client.<br />don&#039;t have time to investage yet,<br />any idea!?</p>									</div>

					<p>rhlee, sure it is possible, you just have to configure the wds client properly.<br />For example if your WDS-AP hands out DHCP in the 10.20.0.0/24 subnet you want to change the WDS-Clients LAN-IP to e.g. 10.20.0.2 to be able to reach it while you got DHCP from the WDS-AP. If the Client still has its original IP address you can declare an interface alias on your local Linux machine and use that to connect to it, e.g. &quot;sudo ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.2 up; ssh root@192.168.1.1&quot; .</p><p>Finally you can also trigger failsafe in the WDS Client, telnet in, run &quot;mount_root&quot; and change the LAN IP to something reachable.<br />Of course you also have to ensure that WDS-AP and WDS-Client use different LAN IPs etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well setting a static IP helped. It&#039;s just annoying to switch between static and dynamic all the time.</p><p>I also came across the non-authoritative dhcp option. I was hoping if I set it on the WDS client, I would be like a failover system. I.e. any dhcp leases from the WDS AP would override and from the WDS client. However if the WDS ap and client were not connected, the wds client could still give out leases. But I couldn&#039;t get it to work.</p><p>Or am I misunderstanding the whole non-authoritative dhcp thing?</p><p>Another thing that saved me from doing a reflash everytime I mucked up was writing a restore script that was triggered by the reset button. A short press would do a reset, medium would untar the config backup on root, long would run firstboot.</p>									</div>
