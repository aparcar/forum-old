I need the feature when pressing and holding the reset button, I can get a factory default running OS.<br />I want to know:<br />1. if this has to be supported by boot loader? <br />2. My device has Redboot on it, does it support hard reset?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>The answer to this question is hardware dependent. On hardware which I have examined, which does not include the Avila, the bootloader has nothing to do with it, and it&#039;s handled entirely by the OS after the bootloader has started it.</p>									</div>

					<p>That depends on the OS. If the OS can&#039;t do it, then the reset button will not help you.</p>									</div>
