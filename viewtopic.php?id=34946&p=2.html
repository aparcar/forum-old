					<p>So I bricked my router TL MR3420 and failsafe by pressing the QSS button dint work, I had to the serial route.</p><p>I bought 2 serial to usb cables, CA-42 and CA-45.

See Pictures below.</p><p>I have tried using putty, screen, minicom and even a custom script to read data from the router, but I cant seem to get anything from the router.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, a wireless network which I set up earlier before bricking the router appears when I power on the router, but I cant connect to it!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

Voltage between White - Blue is 3.6V, between White - Green = 0V and between Green - Blue = 0v. I think Blue is ground, which kind of makes sense from your explanation. Using this combination, I get nothing from putty, even after swapping the cables a bit from here to there.

					<p>Hi tver3305!</p><p>Sorry that I did not answer earlier.<br />Have you already tried to shortcut the two conductors which you suspect to be Tx and Rx?

					<p>Hi again!</p><p>Obviously you took one step further to a solution :-). In most cases GND is colorless (black; white if black is unavailable).</p><p>In my opinion it should work now, but obviously it does not. You already know that GND is white. If you would connect cable-RX to router-TX and cable-TX to router-RX it should be fine. You have only two combinations left. Just try them out:<br />According to your foto you should try the following combinations:<br />A) from left to right: pin 1 no cable; pin 2 white; pin 3 green; pin 4 blue<br />B) from left to right: pin 1 no cable; pin 2 white; pin 3 blue; pin 4 green</p><p>If you believe that GND and TX are somehow connected, check your soldering points once more. On the photo they look quite pretty, but maybe there are pins shortened on the back side of the router&#039;s board. So, take a look at the back side too.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have my second MR3420 borrowed to a friend, so that i cannot test with an ohmmeter the resitance between TX and GND. But you could give it a try: Unplug everything from the router and test with an ohmmeter between TX and GND. Anything above a few ohms (maybe above 5 ohms) would lead to the concludsion that they are not shortened.</p><p>I&#039;m still curious, what the issue could be...</p><p>Regards and good luck,<br />Alex</p>									</div>

					<p>Glad, you could unbrick your box at last.</p><p>Maybe some obscure putty option is set...?<br />The color code of your resistor looks quite correct but maybe you could check once more if it is really 10k-ohms.</p><p>Have a nice day!</p>									</div>
