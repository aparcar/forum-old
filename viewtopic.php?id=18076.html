					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;m currently trying to build Kamikaze 8.09 RC1 for our Buffalo WHR-HP-G54.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I run into a show-stopper when doing so.&nbsp; I get the following error when running &#039;make -j4 V=99&#039;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make[7]: Leaving directory `/home/dwa/devel/openwrt-trunk/build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/linux-2.4.35.4/arch/mips/lib&#039;

  . = ; 
  .init          : { *(.init)&gt;--&gt;---} =0</code></pre></div><p>This, in turn, is generated from build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/linux-2.4.35.4/arch/mips/ld.script.in, the relevant part of which looks like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  /* Read-only sections, merged into text segment: */
  . = @@LOADADDR@@;
  .init          : { *(.init)&gt;--&gt;---} =0</code></pre></div><p>So, it would appear that the substitution of @@LOADADDR@@ is not occuring as it should.&nbsp; This substitution happens in build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/linux-2.4.35.4/arch/mips/Makefile:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>arch/$(ARCH)/ld.script: arch/$(ARCH)/ld.script.in arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile
        sed -e &#039;s/@@LOADADDR@@/$(LOADADDR)/&#039; &lt;$&lt; &gt;$@</code></pre></div><p>Now, LOADADDR is set and modified in a number of IFDEFs further up in that Makefile.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my configuration doesn&#039;t include any of them, so LOADADDR is unset.&nbsp; Hence the empty substitution into ld.script.</p><p>Now it transpires that there is a patch, 001-bcm47xx.patch in build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/linux-2.4.35.4/debian/patches/platform/, which adds a kernel configuration option CONFIG_BCM947XX and an IFDEF into the Makefile which will set LOADADDR appropriately if that configuration option is set.&nbsp; It also appears that I have this configuration option patched in and set in my Kamikaze 7.09 build (which is currently running on the Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 very nicely, but without the new firewalling stuff).</p><p>So my problem appears to be that this patch isn&#039;t being applied.&nbsp; What can I do to ensure that it is applied at the appropriate time?&nbsp; Or should it not be being applied at all?</p><p>Incidentally, I have also been able to reproduce this problem using trunk.</p><br /><p>Dan</p>									</div>

					<p>Right, I&#039;ve worked out what was causing this.&nbsp; I had QUILT_PATCHES set in my environment, which was making everything go horribly wrong.&nbsp; It seems that the patches are copied to build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/linux-2.4.35.4/$QUILT_PATCHES, but are not then looked for there.&nbsp; So something odd is going on.</p><p>Nonetheless, I&#039;m now unblocked.</p>									</div>
