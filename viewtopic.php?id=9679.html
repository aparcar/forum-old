					<p>I just upgraded my router to WR 0.9 (from rc5). It was relatively painless, and it seems to be overall more stable and high quality.</p><p>I noticed an option to set only one antenna (in wireless config).</p><p>I am using my pppoewisphowto instructions for internet. Basically (so you don&#039;t need to look) I&#039;m using wireless in client mode to get to a dsl modem, and pppoe&#039;ing that. I went and bought a Netgear WGT624v3 on Black Friday to act as wireless access to the internet (don&#039;t ask), but my question is this: can I make my openwrt WRT54Gv1.1 work as a client to the wisp on one antenna and a access point on the other?</p><p>tia,<br />poly-p man</p><p>Also, other that the info on the device page, can you tell me anything about openwrt on the Netgear box?</p>									</div>

					<p>The 2 antenna go to a single radio, there&#039;s no second radio hiding in there. In &quot;auto&quot; or diversity mode, it uses whichever is strongest signal at that moment. If you lock it to a single antenna, it&#039;s because you bought a big single antenna and not 2 identical ones.</p><p>This should be added to the &quot;Common mistakes&quot; link I think.</p><p>The typical way to solve your problem is 2 WiFi units back-to-back. One unit in AP-client mode, ethernet cable connecting to another unit (5 channels distant) broadcasting as an AP.&nbsp; This is a dual-radio repeater setup, I&#039;ve done them before and they work well.</p>									</div>

					<p>With kamikaze, you can run a client and access point simultaneously with a single radio. The only restriction is that they need to be on the same channel and they have the same MAC address.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s a bit tricky to be both AP-client, and AP at the same time.</p><p>I have run WDS networks before with a single-radio setup. It&#039;s somewhat clunky. As traffic rises, performance becomes poor due to the multi-tasking required from a single half-duplex radio.&nbsp; Particularly timing senstive apps like VoIP becomes choppy.</p><p>The small WISP I work with, we use WRT units and anyplace I have a repeater station there are 2 radios.&nbsp; One unit with directional antenna strictly for backhaul, and a 2nd unit for local client coverage.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 3 Mar 2007, 03:27)</p>
