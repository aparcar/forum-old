					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I compiled an openwrt x86 build again today, which version is r41553 , pretty new.</p><p>My hardware summary: Celeron 1037u (Ivy bridge) dual cores , and 4g ram , AR9280 wifi card , dual realtek 8168 1000mbps nics.</p><p>In order to fit different situations , I compiled 2 versions:<br />1.sda version. Would fit the situation that , if you install the system on the first bios harddrive. For most people , this version could work perfectly.<br />2.sdb version. If you install the system on second bios harddrive , such as usb disk /sd card /the second harddrive.</p><p>Don&#039;t know which version you should use?<br />Just try the sda version first.(of course , you should backup everything before you flash my build)<br />If you see the boot screen stops at this line &quot;waiting root device /dev/sda2&quot;<br />Then you could try the sdb version.</p><p>Similar to <a href="http://www.powerrc.net/x86-openwrt-smp-4g-ram.html">my last build</a><br />more detail:<br />1.Enabled SMP in the kernel , supports up to 16 cpu threads.<br />2.Enabled HT in the kernel , so it supports hyper threads.<br />3.Enabled big memory option , which supports up to 64G ram , and in my pc , it would shows about 3.7G highmen, if you know the different between highmen and lowmen , you should understand 32bit kernel can never really support 64g ram<br />4.it supports USB keyboard.<br />5.Very pure build, didn&#039;t come with any packages exclude busybox and some basic tools.<br />6.Compiled all intel/qualcomm/broadcom/realtek wireless nic drivers.<br />7.The root partition is sized at 512MB , so if you want to install it on a sd card , you should get a card larger than 1GB.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5237/14607843144_f0ffa561f3_o.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span><br />Have fun <br />Download address=&gt;<a href="http://www.powerrc.net/x86-openwrt-smp-4g-ram-r41553.html">http://www.powerrc.net/x86-openwrt-smp- â€¦ 41553.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>PowerRC</strong> on 9 Jul 2014, 08:00)</p>

					<p>Since you mentioned it, I&#039;ve been using pfSense for several years and I don&#039;t find it being any easier or harder to install on standard PC hardware than OpenWRT. In fact, due to OpenWRT using a recent Linux kernel, it supports a lot more PC hardware than pfSense (which is based on FreeBSD 8.3).</p><p>pfSense&#039;s minimum system requirements are much higher than OpenWRT&#039;s so the base feature-set of the two systems is very different.</p><p>Btw I&#039;d be most interested to hear from anyone who is using OpenWRT in a &quot;big&quot; installation.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ease of installation isn&#039;t usually a priority with most professional or router software. And I&#039;d disagree about the hardware compatibility. As for the minimum requirements and feature set, for the third time, that&#039;s the whole point. As for the kernel, well if you think FreeBSD&#039;s kernel is too old and lacks support there&#039;s no need to use it, you can just as easily install Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora or SUSE and grab the absolute latest Linux kernels and drivers, Openwrt&#039;s hardware support will never even come close.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sure just make sure you compile in all wifi modules it is a much stronger router after all. How big would you make the root partition?, I hope at least a gig.</p>									</div>
