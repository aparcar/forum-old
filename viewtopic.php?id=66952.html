					<p>Hi,</p><p>I would like to build a customized image for several devices which covers the BRCM47xx, RAMIPS and ARxx Soc</p><p>The method to change the default LAN ip is just put a network file under base-files/etc/config/ but my concerns here is different devices may have different network configurations and just one file could not handle the various situations.</p><p>So I would like to ask what&#039;s the best way to change the default ip address ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
