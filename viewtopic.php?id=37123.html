					<p>Hello at all,<br />I&#039;ve an AGPF that is a brcm63xx based router with backfire running. It comes with a boradcom wireless interface and I use b43 driver in client mode to share internet connection from wireless to ethernet ports.<br />Now I would like share internet connection via wireless using an USB wireless adapter (because b43 driver doesn&#039;t support virtual interfaces building). My usb wireless adapter is Ralink based and I&#039;ve installed kmod-rt73-usb with his dependencies via opkg. Driver sesms work fine because dmesg say that driver is registred when I plug in the adapter. The problem is that I can&#039;t see the new interface (like wlan1).<br />What can I do to use the usb wireless adapter interface like AP?<br />Thanks at all.</p><p>Ivan</p>									</div>
