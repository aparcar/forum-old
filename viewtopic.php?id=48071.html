					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I am using &quot;OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r39161 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r9945)&quot; for my WR1043ND router to allow it to deal with IPv6 correctly.</p><p>My configuration looks like:</p><p>- AVM Fritzbox 6340 (provided by my cable-internet provider due to DS Lite. This means taht I get my own IPv6 address but no own IPv4 address. The IPv4 address will be routed by my provider. It&#039;s similarly managed like in LANs)<br />- TP-Link TL-WR1043ND is set up as &quot;exposed host&quot;. At least for IPv4 but it&#039;s actually useless because via IPv4 it&#039;s not reachable.</p><p>The Fritzbox holds the internet connection. It also assigns an IP to the WAN-Port of the TP-Link router. The WAN port is configured as DHCP client. The router&#039;s WAN6 interface is configured as static address. This was the default value. I didn&#039;t change it and it works...</p><p>Now, my problem is that I cannot reach the OpenWRT router by its hostname via IPv6.</p><p>My Win7 computer allows me only to ping the router if I disable IPv6 protocol in Win7. Then the router name will be resolved correctly.</p><p>- IPv4 standardgateway is OpenWRT<br />- IPv4 DNS server is OpenWRT<br />- IPv6 standardgateway is OpenWRT<br />- but IPv6 DNS server is FB6340</p><p>Is it possible to change the IPv6 DNS server? If so, how? Does it make sense? At least I will be allowed to reach the luci interface by its hostname.</p><p>TIA!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fli4l-replacement</strong> on 29 Dec 2013, 15:49)</p>

					<p>Well, immediately after posting you&#039;ll typically find your answers ;-)</p><p>As described in the OpenWrt Wiki, I added hostnames for IPv6. Further information can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6.dns#dns.hostnames.on.the.lan">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6. â€¦ on.the.lan</a></p><p>Without this prework there won&#039;t be resolved any IPv6 related hostname....</p><p>And the most important point for me was how to change the IPv6 DNS server which will be assigned via DHCP.<br />In the luci web interface just go to:</p><p>- Network<br />- DHCP and DNS<br />- Server Settings<br />- General Settings</p><p>There&#039;ll be a cell called &quot;DNS forwardings&quot;(per default it&#039;s empty). I entered there both (my IPv4: 192.168.x.y and IPv6 DNS: fd00::xxxx:yyyy:zzzz:aaaa) server IPs.</p><p>And finally it&#039;s working....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fli4l-replacement</strong> on 30 Dec 2013, 11:23)</p>
