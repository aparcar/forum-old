					<p>Well configs get preserved by an upgrade anyway, though packages do not. I don&#039;t know why the swconfig shows 6 VLANs, this is something that is the default with older drivers on certain switch models though I don&#039;t know the reason behind it. They should really in practice all be tagged. It looks oddly like some sort of hacky workaround for previous bugs.</p>									</div>
