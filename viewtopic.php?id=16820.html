					<p>Hi, can someone send me functional redboot file for this AP? On wiki is example with redboot booted but i cannot find image. I cannot compile it my self, because it thrown everytime some errors. I found image for Dlink DWL-2100AP which is same as WLA-5000AP except FLASH which is different. I boot it successfully but i cant see FLASH of course. It must be easy, but i cant do this. Is there someone ho can do this? Thanks</p>									</div>
