					<p>I also have the same issue on AA and BB trunk on HW v1.6&nbsp; even in the latest versions: Huge packet loss on LAN interfaces rendering the device practically unusable for me on OpenWRT. Had to revert back to stock firmware to get everything back to normal again.</p><p>The LAN ports in LuCi get switched off all the time so one could assume there is something wrong with the atheros switch drivers in some specific board versions. <br />Maybe this deserves a bug ticket ?</p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>

					<p>From my view this is worth a bug report. I can easily reproduce this on 2 different Hardware revisions. And it really sucks. During video calls I have a freeze every 30-40 seconds.
