Reboots every 2-3 hours. Wifi disappearing every now and then, slow and unresponsive gui etc.</p><p>I&#039;m totally new to OpenWrt and I wish I had known about how easy it would be to install 14 days ago... Your image was a no-brainer to install, even had LuCI included (which is a lot better than Linksys stock gui imho).</p><p>In less than 5 minutes I had my ACS setup. Set the root password on the first visit to the gui, enabled both wifi radios, added a few port forwarding rules. No problems experienced so far, having 3 iPads, 3 iphones, 2 Windows desktops, 2 MacBooks, a linux server, an Xbox, 2 linux sat receivers, Apple TV, a smart tv, and old wifi router setup as AP and probably a few more clients in the house connected.</p><p>I&#039;ll be happy to give you feedback and also keep this topic updated with my experience.</p>									</div>
