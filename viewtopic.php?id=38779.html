					<p>Hi</p><p>I only wanted to know if it is possible with the TP-Link TL-WR1043ND and Open-WRT or DD-WRT to use OpenVPN Server of the VPN-Service Perfect Privacy on this router.</p><p>I want to connect it with a VPN Server, so that the Clients I will connect to the router will automatically surf over the VPN.</p><p>Is that possible? So when I connect my smartphone for example via wifi to the router, all traffic will be tunneled over the VPN-server of Perfect Privacy?</p><p>THX for reply!</p>									</div>

					<p>Today I got the router, i flashed it without problems and i played a little bit with it, then i tried to set it behind my internet router and i changed its IP to 192.168.178.2, but after it hung up and didnt work, i closed the tab and tried to connect to it via its new IP in the browser, but it didnt work.</p><p>I also tried the old one, i dont get on the router.</p><p>But when i look in Windows the connection status, i see that its IP is 192.168.178.2 and i got a DHCP-IP. So it worked in the end. But i cant enter the router over the browser.</p><p>I already tried reset, but it doenst work either.</p><p>What can I do now? Did i brick it only by trying to set a new IP???</p><p>Thx!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>OVPN-Slave</strong> on 21 Aug 2012, 16:52)</p>

					<p>Your OpenWrt router and the main router are connected over LAN ports on both routers, right?</p><p>You have to make sure, that you have only one DHCP server running in your network. Connect to the OpenWrt router via a LAN port and disconnect it from the main router. If you have one on your main router what I guess, then you have to disable the DHCP server on your OpenWrt router with:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/dhsnasq stop
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable</code></pre></div><p>You can also disable the firewall on the OpenWrt router:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/firewall stop
/etc/init.d/firewall disable</code></pre></div><p>Then on the OpenWrt router set the main router as gateway, DHCP and DNS server:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.lan.dns=192.168.178.1
uci set network.lan.gateway=192.168.178.1
uci commit network
ifup lan</code></pre></div><p>Then this part should work :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>written_direcon</strong> on 21 Aug 2012, 18:20)</p>

					<p>No, the OWRT is not connected to anything in the moment, when I try to connect my computer via LAN to it I have no access, because I can&#039;t enter via browser with 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.178.2, thats the problem.</p><p>Also the reset button doesn&#039;t work. ( I pushed it long enough)</p><p>What can I do now?</p>									</div>
