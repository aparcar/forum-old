					<p>is EoIP a special protocoll, or is it just a term for layer2-bridging over an IP-connection?<br />You could realize layer2-bridging very easily with openvpn in ethernet bridge-mode </p><p>If you install the luci-openvpn-package you can configure it in the webinterface. There are Templates for &quot;Server Configuration for an ethernet bridge vpn&quot; and &quot;Client configuration for an ethernet bridge vpn&quot; which should make it easy. I never used the webinterface for that, and I run openvpn in routing-mode with an manual configuration, but I guess the stuff in the webinterface works just fine. </p><p>Or you look at&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a> <br />the serverconfig should work just fine, the client-config file need to be changed to the syntax used in openwrt (UCI)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 23 Aug 2011, 12:13)</p>

					<p>@eleon216: thank&#039;s for your answer. I don&#039;t want to use vpn. VPN doesen&#039;t allow multicast. Only unicast works, so i want specifically use eoip for that. Works on mikrotik based routers, but they are too expensive for me. Any idea?</p>									</div>
