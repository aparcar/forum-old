					<p>well when you plug in your router it accepts tftp connections.&nbsp; My linux distribution has tftp installed by default.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the exact settings required but I&#039;m pretty sure this should work.</p><br /><p>download linksys firmware<br />cd /dir/with/.bin file #using absolute path doesn&#039;t work for me<br />echo -e &quot;binary\nrexmt 1\ntimeout 60\ntrace\nput firmware.bin&quot; | tftp 192.168.1.1</p><p>unplug the router<br />run the command ( this is the timeout at work )<br />plug in the router<br />DON&#039;T run the command then unplug and replug in the router.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t work for me so I doubt it will work for you.<br />it should be fixed with a linksys firmware<br />this may or may not work.&nbsp; it worked for me for a openwrt firmware but has nothing to do with an installed firmware.&nbsp; Basically it&#039;s the BIOS /bootloader flashing anything it gets via tftp<br />i guarantee and am held liable for NOTHING!!!<br />I also just installed the 7.09 kamikaze openwrt.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have wireless but I can probably get it working. </p><p>I&#039;m not sure if you need boot_wait to be enabled but I also read that you can fix your router without boot_wait enabled it&#039;s just harder, probably requiring hardware mods.</p><br /><p>forgot to mention that this worked on a wrt54g v2.0 running white russian and then again with kamikaze 7.09</p><p>here are the instructions provided by the wiki<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP?highlight=%28install%29%7C%28tftp%29">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins â€¦ %28tftp%29</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WrinkledCheese</strong> on 28 Apr 2008, 19:57)</p>
