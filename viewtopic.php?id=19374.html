					<p>First time user of OpenWRT on Soekris 5501. The kernel boots and mounts the root file system over NFS. Thereafter the console stops responding.&nbsp; Any ideas on where to begin debugging ( I am compiling busybox with debug flags enabled)?</p><p>Ping works between the eth0 interface (through which NFS was mounted) and the NFS server (same as the PXE boot server).&nbsp; It definitely is an issue with the root file system because if I point the kernel to a different root file system (built for a different soekris box) the whole stuff comes up to the login prompt and everything is alright.&nbsp; </p><p>The file system that worked was built with buildroot, and the one that does not work is from OpenWRT 8.09.&nbsp; </p><p>I tar-gzip the file system on the build-machine, copy it over to the NFS server, gunzip/untar it. </p><p>CPU on Soekris 5501 is &quot;CPU Geode LX 500 Mhz&quot;.&nbsp; <br />Screendump: last few lines on console:</p><p>IP-Config: Complete:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;device=eth0, myaddr=10.0.0.101, mask=255.0.0.0, gw=255.255.255.255,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;host=10.0.0.101, domain=mshome.net, nis-domain=(none),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bootserver=10.0.0.1, rootserver=10.0.0.1, rootpath=<br />Looking up port of RPC 100003/2 on 10.0.0.1<br />Looking up port of RPC 100005/1 on 10.0.0.1<br />VFS: Mounted root (nfs filesystem).<br />Freeing unused kernel memory: 172k freed<br />Please be patient, while OpenWrt loads ...</p><br /><p>Console hangs after the last message about OpenWrt loading.

					<p>Kinda solved.&nbsp; The root file system created by this OpenWRT does not anything under /dev. </p><p>I copied the files under /dev from a good root-file system (from buildroot) to the one created by OpenWRT and now the whole system boots up to a shell. There are quite a few error messages on the console.. but at least the issue is now isolated to the Openwrt scripts/config!</p><p>An issue with the same symptoms:&nbsp; <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4172">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/4172</a><br />- I went through this patch.. but this ticket or the described patch/fix has nothing to do with the issue I have.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ardenfort</strong> on 15 Mar 2009, 21:22)</p>
