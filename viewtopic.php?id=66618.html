					<p>It seems to be disabled in regular builds, unless you explicitly enable <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/utils/lcd4linux/Makefile#L38">CONFIG_BROKEN</a> during your built. I haven&#039;t done building just packages, so you need to read on how to build packages with the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.sdk">SDK</a> on your own.</p>									</div>
