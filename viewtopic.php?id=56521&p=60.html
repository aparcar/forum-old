The stated project goals include getting more people involved and improving documentation. For better or worse, the wiki would be a clean slate as well.

					<p>Hi, I was thinking it would be nice if we included a new descriptive feature Techdata pages. The size matters, it&#039;s about including the <strong>dimensions of the board</strong> or the casing, or both. I prefer only including board dimensions, its more precise and you can figure out how big is the casing.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.skillsyouneed.com/images/geo/area-volume-dimensions.png" alt="http://www.skillsyouneed.com/images/geo/area-volume-dimensions.png" /></span></p><p>Most boards has almost the same height, which matches with the rj45 slots. Then only including <em>lenght x width</em> could be enough.</p><p>Then, eventually when enough boards had their dimensions they could be tagged by their area in small, medium or big</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi dani,</p><p>some questions and thought of mine:</p><p><strong>Which searchrequest does this information help to answer?</strong><br />What would be the use of this information? Who would use&nbsp; this information or benefit from it? </p><ul><li><p>People who are searching for very small devices (e.g. Zsun)</p></li><li><p>People who are searching for a device with specific features (5x Gbit, 2x USB), which should not exceed a certain size</p></li></ul><p>Is size linked to the number of Eth ports? Do we need some extra fields to show the size?</p><p><strong>How can we make this searchable/filterable?</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>Length/height/width (mm/cm)<br />Hard to filter for (3 fields needed), but most accurate and meaningful information<br /></p></li><li><p>Area (cm²)<br />easy to filter for, but questionable information; 30cm² can be 5x6cm or 1x30cm or ...</p></li><li><p>Volume (cm³)<br />same as for area</p></li><li><p>XS/S/M/L/XL<br />- Definition of these size-classes? (postal size-classifications for packets could be a starting point, thinking of the german post &quot;Gurtmaß&quot;)<br />- Example devices for these size-classes?</p></li></ul><p><strong>How easy is this information available? Will it be well populated?</strong><br />Datafields which are not well populated are not that big a use for our &quot;customers&quot;<br />What about users who are afraid to open their device to get the board dimensions?<br /></p><ul><li><p>Enter nothing, wait for someone to enter the board dimensions (that day may never come)</p></li><li><p>Enter case dimensions i/o board dimensions</p></li><li><p>Provide both, case + board dimension fields, so either one or both can be entered</p></li></ul><p><strong>Implementation</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>No problem for future devices (can be implemented in the template_dataentry)</p></li><li><p>Devices currently in the ToH need manual interaction (datafields not available in the dataentry editor, need to be added manually... a lot of work!)</p></li></ul><p>All comments are welcome, especially from possible users of this feature!</p>									</div>

					<p>A possible &quot;customer&quot; can be the use of a board with external antenas with a built in casing. It&#039;s just an example, probably not many people is worried about size.</p><p>No idea what do you mean with the number of ethernet ports and size. Anyway I don&#039;t intend to cause complex relationships between several features.</p><p>The area from my pont of view is enough for filtering. A board with 1x30cm is unlikely to exist in the market, only a few boards like nanostations have this assimetrical desing. There are also a few boards with a triangle form, but they are marginal afterall.</p><p>This information as with other boards features probably will be unpopulated and nobody will fill it. Example: hw leds, buttons. The fact is without this field it will never be filled for sure.</p><p>Sad to read it&#039;s hard to add a new field in devices that are already in the ToH. </p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>I no longer have access to edit the wiki, but a suggestion for someone that still does: Someone has made the Luci install page unnecessarily complicated, which will undoubtedly cause problems for lots of people installing trunk builds and then getting stuck without a GUI. Can someone revert it to the last version? if there were some useful updates in the new version, it would be reasonable to incorporate those.</p>									</div>
