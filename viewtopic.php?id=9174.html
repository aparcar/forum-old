					<p>I just start building up kamikaze environment.<br />My router will be configured with ppp + mppe + pptp as client toward my internet provider.<br />Previous configuration was based on whiterussian RC6. With RC6 I used the ppp precompiled version with the addon packages:<br />kmod-mppe_2.4.30-brcm-4_mipsel.ipk and kmod-crypto_2.4.30-brcm-4_mipsel.ipk by using the ipkg:</p><p>ipkg install kmod-mppe kmod-crypto ntpclient</p><p>After that, more simple additional modifications permits to work.</p><p>The problem is that the output of kamikaze don&#039;t generate any kmod-mppe package.<br />I configured the selection to have the mppe by menuconfig but without any success. I obtain the ppp,<br />pptp and crypto packages but the kmod-mppe packages is not produced. <br />As a comparison&nbsp; the kmod-gre is instead well generated.<br />How is it possible to generate this module.</p>									</div>

					<p>I saw another similar post &quot;<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9147">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9147</a>&quot;<br />(no mppe with BCM947xx/953xx) the configuration is similar and I&#039;ll go to to try the solution there described also with my router, but the question is still there: why the kmod-mppe package is not generated?.</p>									</div>
