					<p>Hey all, I&#039;ve got an issue with my wifi that I can&#039;t seem to figure out.</p><p>I have two routers, one broadcasting &#039;camera1&#039; as its SSID and one broadcasting &#039;camera2&#039; as its SSID.&nbsp; I have five wireless cameras running off of &#039;camera1&#039; and uploading video to an FTP storage device.&nbsp; I seem limited to the five connections on this first broadcast, so I am trying to connect five more to &#039;camera2&#039;.</p><p>I configured both routers the same way with the same hardware, operating system and ipkg software.&nbsp; However, when I attempt to connect a wireless device to &#039;camera2&#039; it does not allow connections.&nbsp; I have a wireless receiver/transmitter that I use for diagnostics connected to my PC, and I can connect to &#039;camera1&#039; no problem.&nbsp; It assigns me a DHCP address as it should and allows me to access the devices on its network.</p><p>&#039;Camera2&#039; does not allow any connections, even in unencrypted mode.&nbsp; I have tried WEP, WPA in all its forms, and have gotten no results.&nbsp; The LAN/WAN are working fine and allow SSH access as well as HTTP.&nbsp; So, if everything seems the same, how come &#039;camera2&#039; is not allowing any connections? </p><p>I have gone over the nvram settings and everything is set up fine.&nbsp; Should I reinstall wifitools or is there some sort of configuration table I could link to help get a diagnosis of this problem? I&#039;m not completely sure why this problem is occuring, although I have tried these things to solve the problem:</p><p>I set &#039;camera2&#039; to a separate channel.&nbsp; Nothing.<br />I set &#039;camera2&#039; to WEP/WPA/Unsecured.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>									</div>

					<p>The &#039;camera2&#039; router is also locking my ssh connection and making it so I cannot type anything.&nbsp; This just started happening with my last flash (I have flashed the jffs2 partition twice now).&nbsp; I have to close my cygwin program and restart it to regain control -- when I try to log back in, it will let me for some time and then lock up.</p><p>What could this be caused by?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve gone through the documentation and I did a -force-reinstall on the ipkg nas, but still can&#039;t connect to my router wirelessly.&nbsp; After close inspection of the &#039;camera1&#039; router I see that the dnsmasq.conf file is completely different, so I am trying to scp the file up to my /etc directory and will reboot my dnsmasq service.</p><p>Other than that, I&#039;m about ready to re-flash this thing again and erase the entire partition.&nbsp; Anyone have a better idea?

					<p>Well, the third flashing seems to have fixed my problem.&nbsp; Since there wasn&#039;t much dialogue in this post or any other ideas on how to fix this problem without re-flashing...</p><p>...When in doubt, erase everything and start over.</p>									</div>
