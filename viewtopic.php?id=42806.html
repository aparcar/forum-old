					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a hold of a Netgear DG834 v4 (wired router). </p><p>Looking at the page for the DG834G v4 (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/netgear/dg834gv4">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrt â€¦ r/dg834gv4</a>) I see a warning that the ADSL modem is unsupported. It looks like that warning was added in January 2012 and was still current in September 2012. There is a query about modem support in this ticket (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10764">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10764</a>), but I can&#039;t find a reply.</p><p>Is there any chance I&#039;ll find support in the SVN tree? Is anyone working with this equipment, or has anyone had success with it?</p><p>All thoughts are appreciated. Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>conn-fused</strong> on 26 Jun 2013, 07:00)</p>

					<p>Update: Broadcom based modem. Future support is highly unlikely. Do not buy.</p>									</div>
