					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m working on OpenWRT for the BT Homehub V2b: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/bt/homehub_v2b">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/bt/homehub_v2b</a><br />So far, I&#039;ve got NOR, NAND, I think ADSL (untested).</p><p>Now I&#039;m working on wireless.</p><p>The Atheros &#039;eeprom&#039; is stored in a nand partition:<br />mtd5: 00010000 00004000 &quot;art&quot;</p><p>I am successfully loading this at load of the ath9k driver.<br />a dump is here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/gndH24Uy">http://pastebin.com/gndH24Uy</a></p><p>The first issue I came across was that the PCI id was 168c:ff1c, not 168c:0027.<br />I modified the driver to add recognition of 168c:ff1c wherever 0027 was recognised.<br />This made the driver load, but then the eeprom is recognised by the driver as &#039;eeprom_def&#039;.<br />In eeprom_def, the eeprom base_eep_header data starts at 0x200, with:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; u16 length; = 0x0cb8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; u16 checksum; = 5140<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; u16 version; = e010<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; u8 opCapFlags; = 00</p><p>opCapFlags = 0 makes the driver think that the card has no capabilities <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ?</p><p>I modified the driver again to force the value for&nbsp; &#039;G&#039; at this point.</p><p>The driver then loads, recognising the correct chip version.&nbsp; I can enable radio0 from luci, and it all seems fine but there is no signal.</p><p>Questions:<br />Is there usually a GPO to enable wireless TX/RX?<br />Would we expect this chip to use eeprom_def?<br />How does my dump compare with other people who have this chip?</p><p>thanks in advance,</p><p>Simon</p>									</div>

					<p>information:<br />followed nbd&#039;s steer and found &#039;pci_ath9k_fixup.c&#039; in target/linux/arch/mips/ath79/</p><p>this contains a function which reads the first part of the eeprom, and interprets the values contained as a set of PCI registers and 32 bit values.</p><p>These are applied to the PCI bus direct at an early stage in boot.</p><p>Problem at the moment is that the call is made well before NAND is available, so I&#039;m trying hardcoded values to see if they work, then will look for a way to call it after nand, but before required...</p><p>Simon</p>									</div>
