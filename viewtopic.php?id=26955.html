					<p>Hi,<br />&nbsp; I am new here.</p><p>&nbsp; I follow this page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd</a> to mod my 741nd.<br />&nbsp; I use 9 pin serial cable not usb cable to connect 741nd and pc.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 1. I only get special character display in terminal(The 9 pin cable is not rs232 to ttl cable, only a normal serial cable).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author has a comment but not picture and I don&#039;t understand it means, any one can show me?:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to get the serial connection work reliably, I had to connect a 10k pullup resistor between the TX and the 3.3V pin. This is because the TX pin is connected to a voltage divider (2x5.6k) and a capacitor is put between the real pin and the TX connector. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 2. I change cable to a rs232 to ttl serial cable. Nothing display in the terminal.</p><p>&nbsp; Any one know what is the problam? I use a wong cable or any other modification I need to do?<br />&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>
