					<p>Hello,</p><p>Last summer I installed a satellite internet system at a quest ranch. Not wanting to &quot;nickle and dime&quot; the guests, we decided to open it up at no cost or restriction. Yes, I have been here before and yes, the quests took full advantage and abused the bandwidth. My partners have now learned the lesson. Moving forward.</p><p>I still want to offer the service free of charge, but need to figure out how to manage bandwidth. Without installing a computer, is there firmware available to install into a WRT54GL router? My goal is to limit daily bandwidth to the quests and still have a means of unrestricted bandwidth access for the owners. Are there other router manufactures offered that would work in this application?</p><p>I tried to find this answer from a previous post without success. I apologize if I am posting something that has already been discussed.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks for your help on this project.</p><p>Ron</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, you could set up 2 virtual access points (i.e. 2 ESSIDs) on your OpenWRT router (this should be possible with quite a lot of architectures, but research first, before you buy hardware) and have one encrypted (for the owners) and the other one unencrypted (for the guests).</p><p>When that works, you can set up QOS in order to limit the throughput of the unencrypted interface.</p><p>Edit:</p><p>You might also want to look at the package nodogsplash or some of the others of that type to present your guests with a splash page when they first connect, so you could have them read your usage policy or whatever.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blubberdiblub</strong> on 19 Feb 2011, 11:32)</p>
