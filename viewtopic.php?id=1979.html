					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;m about to write up a HOWTO in the documentation area regarding setting up uPnP (since I&#039;m a Windows guy as well as a Linux guy and probably know more about why it&#039;s needed than most).&nbsp; However, the solution requires the replacement of the OpenWRT libshared.so with the one from the Linksys firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had this running for 2 days and not spotted any problems, however I need to ask the following questions:</p><p>1. Does anybody expect this will trash core applications in OpenWRT?<br />2. Is everyone happy for me to post this HOWTO with the requirement to replace libshared.so, when this could end up meaning new folks post lots of &quot;Help, OpenWRT is now trashed and I don&#039;t know why!&quot; messages in the forum.</p><p>Note that I&#039;m not a developer (the last thing I seriously coded in was COBOL) and am not a Linux uber-guru.&nbsp; However, I am eminently capable of working things out when I need to.&nbsp; For those of you who give a toss, I&#039;m an IT Security engineer and have a good deal of experience in the IP protocol, hence the reason I&#039;m here and considering that I&#039;m up to the task of owning the uPnP information.</p><p>Kaldek</p>									</div>

I run it on my OpenWRT for a long time now. It is stable and works as expected with XP out of box without any configuration on both sides of wire. Installation is super simple: just run ipkg and _don&#039;t mess with binaries_. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I think it&#039;s important then that I present the two possible options for uPnp - Yani&#039;s package and the Linksys binary.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to make sure my personal preference doesn&#039;t stand out too much. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
