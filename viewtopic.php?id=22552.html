					<p>Hi, I have just bought a WRT54Gv4 and have just installed openwrt in it, and I have been working on the SD card mod for the past few days but could not get it working.<br />I have tried mmc_over_gpio, with and without wireless module, with and without diag, but it is still not working.<br />I&#039;ve tested with DD-WRT and it is working (though unstable) so I think it should not be the problem with my soldering.</p><p>dmesg output:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>gpio-mmc: Failed to request mmc_spi module.
mmc_spi spi32766.0: ASSUMING 3.2-3.4 V slot power
mmc_spi spi32766.0: SD/MMC host mmc0, no DMA, no WP, no poweroff
gpio-mmc: MMC-Card &quot;default&quot; attached to GPIO pins di=2, do=4, clk=3, cs=7
mmc_spi spi32766.0: can&#039;t change chip-select polarity
mmc0: error -5 whilst initialising MMC card</code></pre></div><p>error -5 means IO error, does that mean that other modules are using the GPIO pins as well?</p><p>Does the kernel has such mechanism such that one GPIO pin could only be assigned to one kernel module? If so then how could I check which modules used up the pins so that I could disable them?</p><p>I am a newbie in kernel module programming, reading the codes is a tough job for me, but can still manage to understand quite a bit. I&#039;ve printed a lot of debugging message in the gpiommc kernel module and I think the problem is not with gpiommc, should be somewhere else but I still did not manage to find the error.</p><p>I heard that this issue is already around for a few months, wonder if anyone fixed it already, or at least find out what the problem is.<br />Thank you in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chingjun</strong> on 14 Nov 2009, 18:24)</p>
