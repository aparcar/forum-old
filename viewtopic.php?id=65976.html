					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have an ZyXEL P-661HNU-F1 which seems to be the same as the supported ZyXEL <br />P-661HNU-F3, only with an RJ-11 connector instead of the RJ-45 for the DSL line.</p><p>The device has an usb port which I was hoping to use with an USB Ethernet <br />adapter. ( DM9601, usb id 0fe6:9700 )</p><p>The idea being that the built in lan ports would serve the LAN ports trough NAT and the<br />usb adapter would be bridged for a server with it&#039;s own WAN ip.</p><p>Wondering if this is plausible with openwrt and these devices.</p>									</div>
