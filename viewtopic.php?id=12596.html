					<p>We have the opportunity to secure a large amount of old cisco 340 aps.<br />AIR-BSE342<br />Any thoughts on getting openwrt onto one of these?<br />I&#039;m currently trying to get more specs on the hardware.<br />After disassembly of one of our &#039;test&#039; group aps, I know:<br />It uses a standard 340 PCMCIA adapter on the board (AIR-LCM342). Installing this in ubuntu and it picks right up as a standard wifi card <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Discovered it has a telco jack on the back (the bsm supports ppoe, may have been firmware controlled...great for our local market!)<br />Using a XILINX chip and appears to have a motorola chip on board<br />I do see an intel chip and what appears to be memory chips on board.</p><p>Any thoughts, feedback or ideas would be great! I&#039;m willing to spend some time researching and working towards some sort of solution for this. the in-built firmware is horribly outdated and lacking many basic features.</p><p>Thanks so much!</p><p>a</p>									</div>

					<p>More info...not really good news.<br />From what I can find on the flash chip (intel e28f800) it appears to be an 8mbit storage...means 1 mb. That sounds too small to do much with.<br />We could do without the webgui and many other things (listed in the 2mb flash thread) like ipv6 and such.<br />Lan is Crytal LAN </p><p>Still interested in any thoughts on this!</p><p>a</p>									</div>
