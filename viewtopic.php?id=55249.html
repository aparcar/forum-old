					<p>I have a Linksys-E2000 and have installed the firmware and downloaded the SDK and packages repository.</p><p>I am running on Debian7 wheezy x86_64 (my laptop)</p><p>The Linksys E2000 has a mipsel processor.</p><p>I am studing networking and I have been experimenting with proxies. I have Whonix in a VM, but I thought the challenge of building Tor from scratch and configuring everything on my own would be a good thing to do, so I am doing it. I attempted to build a static Tor binary, but it turns out it wasn&#039;t completly static due to glibc and libnss or something along those lines. So on the side I am also going to try a static compile with dietlibc and am building static cross gcc, binutils, and dependencies atm.</p><p>To the point, I attempted to build the tor-alpha package, but it didn&#039;t work. I tried to setup the environment variables and everything by hand and to compile from tor&#039;s source package (not from feeds but tor&#039;s official release), but I always got the error that the compiler does not work. When I run the cross compiler from the comand-line with dash v, I get the error about libstdc++ not being available, but it is in my LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I tried adding libstdc++ to the dependencies in the package/tor-alpha/Makefile for the different targets but that didn&#039;t change the outcome.</p><p>Has anybody else encoutered similar trouble right off the bat?<br />How can I go about solving this issue?</p><p>Edit: I am going to try and build the openwrt buildroot from source, so if I understand correctly I should also end up building to cross toolchains from scratch, hopefully that helps, idk, several different solutions are presented in different threads, some of which did not work, hopfully this will.</p><p>Edit 2: I Started the buildroot build from the git repo for &quot;Barrier Breaker&quot;, running make atm. Just wanted to say that was pretty slick menuconfig and all, thanks y&#039;all, cross my fingers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WebSlinger</strong> on 21 Jan 2015, 08:50)</p>

					<p>I was searching for how to make Whonix-Gateway but as a firmware in physical Router device and NOT in VM (because of exploits of VM) and came to conclusion that OpenWRT may be only solution...</p><p>Since this is only resulting page from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=whonix+site:forum.openwrt.org">search</a> on this forum containing word Whonix i didn&#039;t want to start another topic...</p><p><strong> First of all to be on the same page (something for inexperience users)... </strong><br />The Gateway VM&nbsp; in Whonix is responsible for running Tor, and has two virtual network interfaces. <br /><em><span class="bbu">Meaning we will need Tor inside OpenWrt.</span></em><br />One of these is connected to the outside Internet via NAT, and is used to communicate with Tor relays.<br />The other is connected to a virtual LAN that runs entirely inside the host.</p><p>I already compiled BARRIER BREAKER (without Tor) who is running on my TL-WR740N V4.27 Router and I know that I have tor_0.2.5.12-1_ar71xx.ipk&nbsp; in CHAOS CALMER but maybe I am to paranoid and like to add some hops, maybe I just like to compile my own firmware IDK <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> but question still stands!<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>WebSlinger wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>How can I go about solving this issue?</p></blockquote></div><p>And we have now <a href="https://dist.torproject.org/tor-0.2.6.10.tar.gz">tor-0.2.6.10.tar.gz</a> (from dist.torproject.org) to compile if possible and not to use outdated 2.5.12 version or tor_0.2.1.30-1_ar71xx.ipk with BACKFIRE as suggested on <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/OpenWRT">torproject.org</a> LOL <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Cross my mind just now that tor 2.1.3 might be rejected and not be able to join tor network...</p><h5>I did some research and find <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49232">this</a> post by accident on forum...</h5><p>I will try that and report if trows some result out... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
