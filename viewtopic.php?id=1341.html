					<p>Best Buy is having a decent sale on the WRT54G/GS routers this week, so I stopped buy and was hoping to find a WRT54G router but all they had were v3.0&#039;s except for one v2.2 (which I heard was bad), so I picked up a v3.0. I was tempted to pickup a v2.0 GS but I&#039;ve also heard bad things about them.</p><p>So, did I do the right thing by buying the v3.0? Can I use OpenWRT with it? Are there any known issues or problems with the v3.0?</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p>									</div>

					<p>please don&#039;t get me wrong in this</p><p>WRT54G is not that bad, ppl say it bad cause Linksys stock firmware made it little harder to get in to it.&nbsp; arn&#039;t we all hackers ?</p><p>do this: download Hyperwrt and use webinter face to flash your linky<br />then poweron while holding the reset button with a stick or pen</p><p>now access your liky bu <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a><br />click on administration then click on start Telnet<br />now you can telnet to your router and set boot_wait=on</p><p>from here do your normal stuff like brick, debrick</p><p>here is my 2 cents</p><p>whenever you sending firmware using tftp<br />plug your router&#039;s lan to a switch<br />plug your pc to the same switch (or HUB) whatever</p><p>this way while router booting network link is up so tftp won&#039;t timeout</p>									</div>

					<p>joe - </p><p>The point was to set boot_wait before loading on a third party firmware, so if anything happened you&#039;d have an easy mechanism for recovery. Do we require that you use boot_wait and tftp? no - you can load openwrt directly using the webpage on the linksys firmware. I always laugh my ass off when I hear about people who flash with other 3rd party firmwares just to set boot_wait so they can reflash into openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>I recently purchased a wrt54g v3, and I was able to flash it with tftp, without setting boot_wait (same reason as above), by holding the reset button while powering on the router, until the upload started.&nbsp; this did not reset the nvram</p>									</div>
