					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m new to this forum, but had to create a Makefile for nbd-client (to utilize the nbd kernel module already existing in Kamikaze 7.09), so I thought I&#039;ll share it with You.<br />I&#039;m using a WRT54GL, so I have the 2.4 kernel version. For this, I needed an older version of the nbd package, 2.7.8 was the highest still compatible version.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

Issuing the command twice and killing the process seems to do the trick.</p><br /><p><span class="bbu">So how to use it, you might ask:</span><br />Let&#039;s assume you have some storage space on a Linux server near, and you want to export a large file emulating a block device (or a real partition, or a whole disk - although nbd won&#039;t support partitioning it, so you&#039;re in super-floppy mode now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> ). (EDIT: NEVER and I say __NEVER__ export a mounted filesystem, or use an RW filesystem from more than one client, the result WILL be a smaller disaster - I warned you!)<br /><strong>On the server:</strong><br />-Create a big file with ext2/ext3 (or whatever you like) filesystem.<br />-Export it like this: &quot;/bin/nbd-server 300 /home/someone/wrtexport.img&quot;<br /> 300 is a custom TCP port you like, the last parameter is the filename.<br /><strong>On the router:</strong><br />-To set up the block device: &quot;nbd-client 192.168.1.123 300 /dev/nbd/0&quot; (192.168.1.123 is the imaginary server in this example - if you want to swap on this device, then use the -swap parameter too)<br />-To mount it: &quot;mount /dev/nbd/0 /mnt -t ext3&quot; (ext3 as an example; because Kamikaze likes to mount my ext3 as ext2; wrong search order, had to tell it explicitly...)<br />-To disconnect:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; umount /mnt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nbd-client -d /dev/nbd/0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nbd-client -d /dev/nbd/0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; killall nbd-client</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>VLsoft</strong> on 5 May 2008, 01:48)</p>
