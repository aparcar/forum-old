An ethernet adapter is a &quot;device&quot;. The Chromecast is a &quot;host&quot; when it connects to the ethernet adapter.&nbsp; A host can power a device, but a device is not allowed to power a host.&nbsp; So what you describe violates the model.&nbsp; And it looks like that is exactly what Google does here.</p><p>Answering your question: For OpenWRT to do the same, you will need <br />a) a router with an USB port that can function as the device end.&nbsp; An OTG port would be fine<br />b) a gadget driver emulating one of the USB ethernet devices supported by the Chromecast. If this doesn&#039;t include any of the USB-IF standard protocols (and it might not), then you have a problem....<br />c) an USB cable allowing you to violate the power flow requirements - your OTG port will not allow this.</p><p>There is a DIY recipe here, using a supported ASIX based ethernet adapter (which is a hell of a lot easier):<br /><a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=footer#!topic/chromecast/xo_NDh5CZA8">https://productforums.google.com/forum/ â€¦ o_NDh5CZA8</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bmork</strong> on 8 Nov 2015, 19:41)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the detailed information. A USB host-to-host cable supported by chromecast in combination with a y-otg adapter would be fine.</p>									</div>
