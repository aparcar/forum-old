					<p>While googling around for Linux support for Ubicom processors I stumbled upon this: <a href="http://linux.sys-con.com/node/969790">http://linux.sys-con.com/node/969790</a> </p><p>Could anyone with some insight please comment on the impact of this? Will we see cheap gigabit routers with OpenWRT arriving in the near future? That&#039;s what I&#039;d like to hear anyway... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting! Even more interesting that this news is not on the OpenWRT frontpage especially when the OpenWRT administartors seams to be involved according to the Ubicom press release.</p><p>As far as I know D-Link is currently the only AP provider that uses Ubicom processors (DIR-655 and 855). The hardwarewise the spec of the mentioned D-Link APs looks interesting, but personally I&#039;m no big fan of D-Link.</p>									</div>
