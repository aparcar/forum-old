					<p>This report applies to a WRT54GS v1.1 flashed with the experimental build dated 13/3/2005 with jffs2 file system and no squashfs. To this build I have added openvpn and dropbear packages from experimental repository.</p><p>Other than the missing passwd and group, I have found that:</p><p>- using scp (wrt is scp client, my home server is scp server) fails because there is no /usr/bin/dbclient file. making a symlink from /usr/sbin/dropbear to /usr/bin/dbclient makes scp work in client mode.</p><p>- after applying the previous patch, using scp (in client mode) fails if the remote host&#039;s key is not already known to dropbear, because when dropbear asks&nbsp; if I want to continue connecting, it seems that it does not wait for the answer to the &quot;y/n&quot; question and somehow assumes I have hit &quot;n&quot;.</p><p>Example:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@gerbil:~# scp casa.kurgan.org:a .
WARNING: Ignoring unknown argument &#039;-x&#039;
WARNING: Ignoring unknown argument &#039;-oForwardAgent no&#039;
WARNING: Ignoring unknown argument &#039;-oClearAllForwardings yes&#039;

Host &#039;casa.kurgan.org&#039; is not in the trusted hosts file.
(fingerprint md5 62:71:18:22:16:37:94:4e:7d:1e:4b:72:ea:85:88:6c)
Do you want to continue connecting? (y/n)
/usr/bin/dbclient: connection to root@casa.kurgan.org:22 exited: Didn&#039;t validate host key
root@gerbil:~#</code></pre></div><p>A workaround for this issue is to ssh the the remote host first, accept the remote host key, and then when the key is already known to dropbear, you can also run scp.</p><p>- Scp does not work also in server mode. If I try to scp something from the wrt (thus wrt is the scp server)it fails because the file /usr/libexec/sftp-server is missing.</p><p>Example:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[c:]pscp root@192.168.1.1:a .
root@192.168.1.1&#039;s password:
ash: /usr/libexec/sftp-server: not found
unable to initialise SFTP: could not connect</code></pre></div><p>- The openvpn package does not contain any configuration file (in /etc/openvpn) and also does not contain an init script to automatically run the vpns on boot. I know that the user can take care by himself of the configurations and init scripts, but at least making the directory /etc/openvpn and installing a startup script in init.d should be a good idea.</p><p>More bugs to come if I find them.</p>									</div>

					<p>My package repository is unofficial, because it is built from newer CVS sources rather than current experimental snapshot. So yes, all the stuff in there will make it into the next snapshot. The reason I&#039;m keeping it is, that people can try some newer stuff to see if all the bugs are fixed and to try out newer packages, so we don&#039;t get the same bug reports over and over again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks nbd, the sftp issue is clear now.</p><p>About the kernel messages, it should be a good idea to disable the message that says &quot;loading this module will taint the kernel&quot;. This message, which is displayed (obviously) every time the modules from the original WRT distribution are loaded (et, wl) makes reading the initialization messages a little difficult. I know the purpose of that message, but in this envinronment in which we NEED to use modules from Linksys, it&#039;s just annoying and nothing more.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure what configuration pieces would be useful here other than what I posted already. My ipchains setup isn&#039;t too complicated, just a couple of port forwards. The packages I added include dropbear, strace, and tcpdump. I&#039;m using a static IP</p><p>I cleaned out the router, and the following steps seem to be enough to retrigger the problem:</p><p>ipkg install wondershaper (installs kmod-sched and tc as dependencies. complains about sched-modules, but I imagine this is covered by kmod-sched)</p><p>edited the /usr/sbin/wshaper script to match my upload and download speeds (probably irrelevant)</p><p>Reboot (it runs /usr/sbin/sch_modules and /usr/sbin/wshaper. The reboot isn&#039;t necessary, it fails either way as long as the scripts above are run)</p><p>Run sh -x /usr/sbin/wshaper (sh -x not required of course, but useful for debugging)</p><p>Here&#039;s where it starts to get upset. 3rd tc command:<br />+ tc qdisc add dev vlan1 root handle 1: cbq avpkt 1000 bandwidth 10mbit<br />Segmentation fault</p><p>(in other iterations I confirmed that the command above triggered the oops I pasted)</p><p>Then it hangs on the next command:<br />+ tc class add dev vlan1 parent 1: classid 1:1 cbq rate 575kbit allot 1500 prio 5 bounded isolated</p><p>until I ^C.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have just found that if I install the openntpd package (ver 3.6.1p1-1) and then I boot the WRT without internet connection, the init script for ntpd (S49ntpd) hangs forever trying to connect to the ntp server (actually it seems to hang on dns resolution for the ntpd server). I am unable to login from telnet, ssh, or serial line.</p><p>Myabe a simple modification to S49nptd should solve this issue. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
mkdir -p `grep &quot;^ntp:&quot; /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6`
/usr/sbin/ntpd -s &amp;</code></pre></div><p>Simply putting and &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of the last line allows the boot process to continue even if ntpd cannot connect to the ntp server, and I think it should not do any harm. You simply end up with a wrong clock, that should anyway get the correct time as soon as ntpd can connect to the ntp server. (just tried it)</p><p>There should also be a way to enable a terminal (on the serial port or using telnet) even if some of the init.d scripts locks up. Or maybe there is one already but I don&#039;t know about it...</p><p>Maybe it should also be a good idea to have every init.d script echo something on the console (the serial port?) when it starts and it ends, so that if something goes wrong it&#039;s easy to find where the problem is.</p>									</div>
