					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a modem with openwrt installed. The modem hardware is Ralink RT305x. This modem comes with a usb 3g modem connected to a mini pci port interface. The 3g modem is working with the OEM firmware with 2.6.21 Linux kernel. It is not even listed among usb devices with openwrt installed using 3.3.8 Linux kernel.</p><p>I want to get the mini pci recognized and working by openwrt as it can be useful in many different ways.</p><p>How can I do that?</p>									</div>

					<p>Many 3G modems plug into a mini-PCIe slot, but they actually do not use the PCI bus, they connect via USB.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the RT305x chip has a PCIe bus controller.</p><p>Is anything related to USB starting up in the kernel log?&nbsp; Make sure it is built with USB support.</p>									</div>
