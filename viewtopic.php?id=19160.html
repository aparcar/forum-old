					<p>Can someone tell me what root device the kernel is looking for, or how to override it? Apparently it&#039;s not checking /dev/cfa or /dev/cfa2. I&#039;m able to boot off of /dev/cfa or dhcp/tftp, but it never runs userland properly. Looks like there&#039;s an initrd in the kernel that has some init scripts, but it fails writing to /dev/log and then halts. I&#039;m trying 8.09.</p>									</div>
