					<p>Hi, I mentioned ushare here already, ushare running as media server on wl-500gp or any other openwrt based router. Current ps3&#039;s FW allows to play .mp4 video files. But the latest official ushare build (1.1a) don&#039;t support .mp4 video format. I found out, that if someone wants to increase amount of supported formats in this case must ad some lines to mime.c </p><p>ie:&nbsp; &nbsp;{ &quot;mp4&quot;,&nbsp; &nbsp;UPNP_VIDEO, &quot;http-get:*:video/mp4:},&nbsp; &nbsp; into this structure mime_type_t MIME_Type_List</p><p>I did it, I packed this modified file back to archive and counted new md5sum, changed Makefile with URL to new placed archive and typed new crc number in, after I typed make and when building process went to ushare part it asked me for patch file, and there me knowledge of gcc ended</p><p>Soo, is here anybody who could prepate some fix / advantage for new supported files to repository or explain how to build direct package alone for such &quot;dummies&quot; as me? thank you much</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>_lilibox_</strong> on 7 Jul 2008, 19:15)</p>
