					<p>hi all,</p><p>i&#039;m new to this forum and to openwrt; so please forgive me any newbie-mistakes...</p><p>i have a linksys wrt54G Rev 3.1 with SD-mod, running kamikaze 8.09 (kernel 2.4.x)... the sd-card is working...</p><p>now, i wanted to mount the sd-card to have enough space to install some additional software - to do this, i followed this howto (i like the idea to have the original filesystem still &quot;available&quot; if anything fails):<br /><a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)KamikazeConfiguration(2f)BootFromExternalMediaHowTo.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs( … HowTo.html</a></p><p>after setting the correct gpiomask for the rev 3.1-mod, everything works fine, EXCEPT:<br />- the part &quot;Testing the script with your setup&quot;; grep-commands make the router stall<br />- autostarting the bootext-script will cause a loop, which can only be stopped by removing the micro-SD (i soldered the sd-adapter on the linksys, so i can change the microSD) and power off/power on the router...<br />- starting the script (/etc/init.d/bootext start) will also make the router stall</p><p>B U T&nbsp; &nbsp; when (the rooter boots &quot;normal&quot;, and) i enter the command</p><p>echo &quot;0xb8&quot; &gt;&gt; /proc/diag/gpiomask </p><p>manualy before &quot;bootext start&quot;, everything is working fine...</p><p>i copied the bootext-script and the bootfromexternalmedia-config 1by1 from the howto-page, altering the gpiomask and mount-points i needed...&nbsp; as a &quot;new to linux-script and -config&quot;-guy, i think the echo-command in the bootext-script is not beeing processed/or not in the needed chronological order... at the moment, i start the router without bootext, then i enter the gpiomask &amp; start the bootext-script... due to my &quot;experiments&quot; with/on the router &amp; the software, i have to reboot frequently, what makes this procedure very ... hard.</p><p>does anyone has an idea how i can solve this problem, so i can enable the script for automatic start on bootup?<br />(if you need any config-files or system-logs: pls. tell me which ones, or how i can get them &amp; i&#039;ll post them, thanks!!)</p><p>cheers &amp; thanks for any reply!<br />mike</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the same problem as mike-k. I inserted the line</p><p>echo &quot;0x9c&quot; &gt;/proc/diag/gpiomask </p><p>at the beginning of function &#039;bootext_start()&#039; and commented out following line:</p><p>#[ $module != mmc ] || [ ! &quot;$gpiomask&quot; ] || echo &quot;$gpiomask&quot; &gt; /proc/diag/gpiomask || bootext_fail &quot;could not set gpiomask&quot;</p><p>After that I could enable the script like described in:&nbsp; <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs%282f%29KamikazeConfiguration%282f%29BootFromExternalMediaHowTo.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs% … HowTo.html</a><br />Now after booting OpenWRT my mmc-card was correctly mounted as root directory.</p><p>After that opkg still tried to use the old filesystem instead of the mmc card. Now i edited /etc/opkg.conf and commented out following line:</p><p>#option overlay_root /jffs</p><p>And finally I could install packages on the mmc-card.<br />Hope this helpes anyone <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
