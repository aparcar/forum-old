					<p>Really tough problem:</p><p>Installed Kamikaze 8.09 2.4-brcm stock on a WL-330gE, worked great.</p><p>In the process of trying to configure client mode (it&#039;s WAY harder than White Russian), I managed to disable the single ethernet port entirely. Not sure how I did that, but it had something to do with the bridging configuration, which is really not well documented. I disabled bridging on the LAN, left it enabled on the WAN. </p><p>Kamikaze boots fine, connects to the network fine, and I absolutely cannot get into it. I can boot to failsafe mode, and the ethernet port is still disabled. Power light blinks, ethernet light remains off. Sniffing the ethernet wire on bootup reveals no packets at all. Sniffing the wireless on bootup shows a DHCP request packet before switching to the static IP. </p><p>I tried portscanning the hell out of it, and it reports every port closed on the WAN interface. </p><p>Is it completely hopeless? I&#039;ve been unable to detect a single packet on the ethernet interface since I hosed it. What I need is a way to get into it via the wireless interface and reset the configuration.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi cw5301, I&#039;m sorry to hear that this happened. Try booting and holding the reset button until the power LED flashes like you say, the device will then be in bootloader recovery mode. Set your IP address to 192.168.1.2 and ping the router at <strong>192.168.1.220</strong>. If that works, tftp an image to 192.168.1.220 as well.</p><p>As a side note, the <strong>WL-330gE is not officially supported in 8.09</strong>, so you won&#039;t be able to get in to OpenWrt failsafe mode (don&#039;t confuse this with the bootloader recovery mode which should work). Everything else is functional, but you&#039;ll need to <a href="http://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2009-February/003900.html">apply my patches</a> to get the that working, which would have been useful.</p><p>As a courtesy, I&#039;ll pre-package a generic 8.09 image for the WL-330gE this afternoon and write up about it on the wiki so this doesn&#039;t happen to anyone else. You may want to use that image if you find you&#039;re able to recover the device.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Dave... Unfortunately the WL-330gE doesn&#039;t respond on 192.168.1.220 when in safe mode. Apparently - and I don&#039;t know how this is possible since supposedly Kamikaze doesn&#039;t write to NVRAM - the ethernet port is completely disconnected, even in safe mode.</p><p>I have tried ping sweeps of the entire 192.168.0.0 address space via the ethernet while in safe mode, and it doesn&#039;t respond to anything. I&#039;ve tried sniffing the ethernet port while booting into safe mode for any sign that the router is listening on the ethernet port at all - and nothing.</p><p>What I&#039;m trying to figure out is what it IS doing while in safe mode - there isn&#039;t any wireless activity I can detect either. </p><p>It looks like it&#039;s bricked, which is ironic, because it boots and connects to the wireless network fine in normal mode, there&#039;s just nothing I can do with it. Do you know if it is possible to solder on a USB header? That looks like about the last hope for this one.</p><p>Thanks for the patch - the precompiled image will be an even bigger help as I haven&#039;t delved into compiling Kamikaze yet. I have another WL-330 on the shelf and would like to avoid bricking another one...</p><p>I appreciate your help,</p><p>cw</p>									</div>

					<p>cw5301, there&#039;s got to be some way to recover it! Have you tried the Asus Firmware Recovery tool? If you can boot it in the bootloader recovery mode, ie the light flashes, then there&#039;s got to be a way. Keep us posted with your progress. If you manage to flash the firmware image above you&#039;ll get the OpenWrt failsafe mode which will help you recover from bad settings without the need for a reflash. Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve tried the Asus firmware utilities - they don&#039;t detect the device at all, and I thought they used the MAC address, so the ethernet seems to be completely shut off. I really don&#039;t know how that happened... the only thing I can think of was disabling the bridge on the lan interface, and it doesn&#039;t seem like that should have killed it in safe mode also.</p><p>One interesting thing: in normal mode bootup I see a dhcp lease of 192.168.1.217 on the access point, but the device is set to a static IP of 192.168.1.6. The .217 address was the dhcp lease for the device before I bricked it. I&#039;m trying to figure out if there is a way to TFTP an image over the wireless on bootup... boot wait is set to 5 seconds and is working, and the wireless light comes on before the power light in normal mode.</p><p>Also I opened it up and there is a 4 pin header on the board... hopefully USB and I&#039;m looking for some kind of info on how to try to connect to the thing that way.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dave you may be right that the holes on the board are for a serial vs USB port - but that might be my solution. I found a page detailing installation of a serial port on the WL-520GU and hope the WL-330gE will be similar. I&#039;m still fuzzy (from the other page) about the practical details of flashing the Kamikaze image over the serial line, however.</p>									</div>

					<p>I believe I was the one who downloaded the wrong image... but I haven&#039;t done anything with it yet. </p><p>I was able to connect a serial port and null modem cable to the wl-330ge, but I only get gibberish in a console terminal program (minicom), using 115200/8N1, which seems to be the standard for other Asus devices. I tried every other speed and settings combination, and only get other versions of gibberish. </p><p>I tried using agetty, and can get a &quot;password:&quot; prompt, but cannot log in - I think that is a bogus prompt.</p><p>It seems like I&#039;m pretty close - if I could just figure out what settings to use for the console terminal, I could probably fix the thing. In safe mode I get what looks like the TFTP &quot;wait prompt&quot; (although it is in gibberish), while in normal mode it appears to be booting all the way to a normal linux prompt - but I can&#039;t read it.</p>									</div>
