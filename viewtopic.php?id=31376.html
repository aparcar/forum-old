					<p>Hi,</p><p>I know that actually there is no support for Ralink boards, just in SVN/trunk I have found something. I have a SMC SMCWEBS-N here but it is actually not available as a device in the trunk.<br />First important thing to know on this devices is that it runs his serial port at <strong>115200</strong>,8,N,1 and not 57600 (which seams to be the default for RAMIPS in trunk).</p><p>I would like to ask if it is possible to add it and/or some one with more knowledge of this suff may have a look on it, becaue i think it should be (easy) possible to support it as well.<br />I did a quick and dirty compilation of SVN/trunk (choosed a random image and loaded it to the board) and the device begins to boot but then crashes with a kernel panic.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>VFS: Cannot open root device &quot;(null)&quot; or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct &quot;root=&quot; boot option; here are the available partitions:
1f00             192 mtdblock0  (driver?)
1f01              64 mtdblock1  (driver?)
1f02              64 mtdblock2  (driver?)
1f03             832 mtdblock3  (driver?)
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)</code></pre></div><p>I did a quick device discription in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/smc.smcwebs-n">WIKI</a> for you all. Would be great if someone can help me with that.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
