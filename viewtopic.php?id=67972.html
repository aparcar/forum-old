					<p>I suspect, this speed issue either is because of the distance to the&nbsp; VPN-server used by VPN-Express _or_ (more likely) by the great firwall, which might know the VPN-servers IP, and doing some more checking on your traffic. Or, just by purpose, slow down traffic speed to discourage use.</p><p>In your case, I would rent a cheap small VS in the US; setup my private VPN server there and give it a try.</p>									</div>
