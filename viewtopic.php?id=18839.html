					<p>Hello guys, </p><p>I have a ASUS WL-500GP v1 router and I want to buy a atheros chip so I can run the 2.6 kernel of the latest kamikaze release 8.09RC2. The issue is that i&#039;m not decided on which mini-pci card to get... so I need your advice on this. The cards are:<br />1.COMPEX WLM54G 200MW ATHEROS 802.11BG MINIPCI WIRELESS CARD (CHIPSET AR2413)<br />2.WISTRON NEWEB CM9 ATHEROS 802.11ABG<br />3.TL-WN560G MINIPCI ATHEROS 5006X 2.4 GHZ <br />4.TP-LINK 660 802.11BG AR5213<br />5.TL-WN360G</p><p>1 and 2 are twice more expensive than the other cards but I wan&#039;t to get one that works. What do you recommend?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I have the TP-Link TL-WN660g and after some playing around it works alright with R Kamikaze 8.09 RC2. It seems that there are still some atheros specific problems in RC2, but the softled-related stuff in the following thread solved my problems: <br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17921">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17921</a></p><p>I can&#039;t compare the performance of my card with other atheros-based ones though. My impression is that now at least I get a performance which is roughly on a par with the original card.</p><p>Cheers,<br />hol9000</p>									</div>
