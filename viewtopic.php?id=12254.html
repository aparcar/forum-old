					<p>Ligowave just came out with a few nice looking products, including dual and quad radio external routers.&nbsp; Their price point is really good (external dual radio for $305).&nbsp; What would it take for openwrt to support it?&nbsp; The better ones are based on Intel IXP processors, with at least 8MB of flash and 64MB of RAM, and Atheros based mini-pci radios. </p><p>(Board: <a href="http://www.deliberant.com/estore/web/pc-1091-8-dlb200-pcba-w-wili-s-pre-loaded.aspx)">http://www.deliberant.com/estore/web/pc … aded.aspx)</a><br />(Router: <a href="http://www.deliberant.com/estore/web/pc-1165-31-lgo2agn-80211abg-abg-connectorized-dual-radio.aspx)">http://www.deliberant.com/estore/web/pc … adio.aspx)</a></p><p>We have a few of these routers in-hand, so we are ready to try openwrt out right away.&nbsp; The default firmware is based on Wili, so hopefully supporting openwrt is as easy as 123....or just a bit harder.</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to add board specific support and submit patches to us. Some thing are pretty generic on IXP4xx (flash access, serial ports, etc), but other things are not (PHY IDs, GPIO mapping for PCI, etc).<br />Alternatively, you cna donate a board to work on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, USPS is indeed a lot less.&nbsp; I wonder how DHL and UPS (which are the ones I checked) can charge so much more. Kaloz, I will send you an email so that we can exchange some additional information.</p>									</div>
