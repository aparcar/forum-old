I, for the sake of curiosity, this did at wrt3200, took the rootfs from OpenWRT/LEDE and collected its kernel, and it worked. Unfortunately, I know bad build OpenWRT, but someone well wielding can try.<br />I have collected a test kernel for wrt32x who wants to try. After a short processing Rootfs you can take from the OpenWRT.<br /><a href="https://github.com/ValCher1961/McDebian_WRT3200ACM/tree/master/test">https://github.com/ValCher1961/McDebian … aster/test</a></p><p>@davidc502, you can make such a version of OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

As to how it works compared to the stock firmware, well that would be subjective. There are just too many variables for each person&#039;s environment all the way to all of the different devices people use to connect. My suggestion would be to install the build and see how it works for you. </p><p>There&#039;s zero difference between these builds and lede/openwrt trunk. Where the difference comes in is what packages are included. Over time I&#039;ve tried to include some of the more popular application so that the user doesn&#039;t have to install it every time they want to upgrade. Another difference is how long packages are kept in the repository. Currently, there are builds and packages 8 months old, so if someone has an older build and wants to add packages, they can continue to do that.</p>									</div>
