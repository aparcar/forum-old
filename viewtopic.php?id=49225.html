					<p>Hello all, i have a couple of openwrt routers and everytime i want to update some settings i need to go into each one of them and apply them manually. Recently i did an script that with one file with configurations i can quickly update what i need without using the web interface. Now i m thinking a little bit ahead, my idea is making an small php application that can upload that file i mentioned before into the router and the script i did keep&#039;s running as a daemon.</p><p>The help i m seeking is besides SSH and SFTP what are the ways you can send data from 1 server to the openwrt routers. Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Criostage,</p><p>Linux in general supports multiple ways to transfer files.<br />NFS and SMB/CIFS (using Samba) are 2 more examples of them.</p><p>From a sys/network admin perspective I would be less worried about how to get the updated file on the device (server), but more on the process of having it used, aka reload of the daemon involved.</p><p>Back to your openwrt routers (with limited resources).</p><p>On the device side, I think you can forget PHP. But a bourne (Bash) script will work very well.<br />Cron might very well be your biggest friend, _if_ you can manage to get the file&#039;s timedatestamp corrcect. If after every file transfer the file&#039;s datestamp is somewhere in 1970, nothing will ever work.</p><p>My best option is to have NTP working and your updated file has the correct time/date stamped.<br />From there it&#039;s not so hard anymore. Using Cron a process can be started to check for newer files and if one found, kick the process to force a reload (not restart).<br />Cron can start this process every let&#039;s say 15 minutes, so after maximum 15 minutes your updated config is active. Other intervals are perfectly acceptable. Cron uses very few resources.<br />Examples of crontab (the config file of cron) are easy to find on the web.</p><p>Before making the changes in crontab, simply test your checking-for-new-file script by manually starting it.<br />If possible have the &#039;touch&#039; utility on-hand while testing the script. It might save you a number of times sending the updated file while debugging your script.<br />This process is highly fool proof, as the router has 1970 as system year shortly after booting, and only after NTP sets the date/time correct, the new file will be detected.<br />If for some reason your updated file was not detected, it&#039;s possible the date was still 1970 (file transfer done after boot but before NTP kicked in). It can happen on a very rare occasion, simply resend the file and wait maximum 15 minutes.</p><p>I&#039;m not a great help for a (bourne/bash) script to detect a newer file, but I&#039;m sure your favorite web search machine is your best friend.</p><p>&quot;Why stop at 110% of use of our SOHO router if we can reach 120%&quot;</p><p>M</p>									</div>
