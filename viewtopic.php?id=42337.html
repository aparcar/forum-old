					<p>I have just started using OpenWRT as a router for a Virgin Media SuperHub. The SH was not very reliable and kept dropping connections. I thought I would take other peoples advice and set the SH to &#039;Modem Mode&#039; and use a router. I had an old DSL-2740B C2 lying aroound and found that OpenWRT would work. <br />What I could not find an example of anywhere despite a fair bit of looking around was how to configure something without a std modem port to use one of the switch ports as a modem port.<br />It isn&#039;t rocket science and I figured it out. I thought I would post the details for other people looking for the info,</p><p>Download the &#039;bin&#039; file for OpenWRT, I just used the one in &#039;trunk&#039; </p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm63xx/openwrt-DSL274XB-C2-squashfs-cfe.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ fs-cfe.bin</a></p><p>Plug directly into the DSL-2740B, manually set your LAN connection properties to &#039;IP Address&#039; 192.168.1.2&#039; and &#039;Subnet Mask&#039; to 255.255.255.0. You don&#039;t need to set any other details, you can leave the rest blank.</p><p>Switch off the router, hold in the reset button and switch on. Hold reset until the power light goes red.</p><p>Browse to &#039;<a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>&#039; upload the bin file and wait for the router to reboot.</p><p>Telnet to &#039;192.168.1.1&#039; </p><p>Set your passwd</p><p>Type <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>vconfig add eth0 2</code></pre></div><p>Edit /etc/config/network to look like <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>Hi Wobbler,</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to document this process, I used it on an older version of virgin mobile modem (ambit VMNG 300 - I resisted the superhub) and a&nbsp; DSL-2740B and can confirm it works.</p><p>I was about to give up as following the wiki guide for a DOCSIS modem I could not get OpenWRT (Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) connecting to the internet.</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>
