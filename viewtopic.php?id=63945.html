					<p>Hi, <br />I&#039;m kind of noob on this area, so please understand my situation....</p><p>Here is the problem:<br />I&#039;ve configured my Dragino MS14 as zabbix-agent on active mode. I also have a Auto-dicovery rule so that any agent with a host name like dragino-inux will be associated with the Linux OS template, whenever it connects to the server.<br />All good, the hosts are always able to connect to the server and receives the correct template. <br />This way I can monitor itens like CPU usage, memory and so on...like any other linux machine.</p><p>So, I&#039;m moving forward and want to use this zabbix-extra-wifi: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/zabbix">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/zabbix</a></p><p>I was able to import the wifi template into the zabbix-server (via GUI) and that is where I got suspicious...there is no items to monitor on this template. Just &quot;Item Prototypes&quot; under the WIFI Discovery rule.<br />At the host side I have the zabbix-extra-wifi package installed. </p><p>Then I start the zabbix agent, with a different hostname (dragino-wifi, btw), it&#039;s correctly recognized by the server, it receives the correct template association (WiFi), but it does not get any item to monitor....</p><p>This way, I don&#039;t have any information about the acces point on my dragino.</p><br /><p>Any ideas on how to solve this?<br />I&#039;m really new on this, so it&#039;s clearly some step that I&#039;m missing during the setup process...</p><p>Thanks for now.</p><p><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
