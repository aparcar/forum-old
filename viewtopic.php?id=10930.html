					<p>I&#039;ve already read the wiki and searched the forums. So I know there is no official support for broadcom wireless drivers in kamikaze kernel 2.6. But I&#039;ve seen some posts from which I understood people are using some sort experimental drivers... Is there anything like that in the wild?</p>									</div>

					<p>well, solca said:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>* AFAIK, the broadcom chip BCM4306 on some (or all?) WRTs interconnects via the SB bus and is not a regular PCI device.<br />* AFAIK, the mac80211 branch of the bcm43xx driver have support for some of this.<br />* AFAIK, Kamikaze have not migrated yet to mac80211 stack.</p></blockquote></div><p>So I guess the fact that broadcom chip uses SB bus instead of PCI bus will be a problem. Can anybody give me more details about this issue?</p>									</div>

					<p>out of curiosity what in particular are you trying to achieve?&nbsp; you mentioned that you want to use you 500gP as an AP but what else?&nbsp; I only ask this because there is much easier ways if that is all that you are trying to accomplish? is there something in particular that you need from kamikaze?&nbsp; it may be possible that you could use oleg&#039;s fw (http://oleg.wl500g.info/) or tomato (<a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato</a>)[but without usb support <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />]</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I need kamikaze because I&#039;ve attached an ADSL modem on USB which works great in Kamikaze. Also, the pppoe connection is quite easy to setup. Also if Kamikaze is the next version of OpenWrt I guess I should use it and help the community with my feedback...</p>									</div>

					<p>I had some problems getting the USB modem and pppoe connection up and working on kamikaze 2.6 and don&#039;t want to go through that pain again.
