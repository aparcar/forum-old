					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have downloaded and installed the openwrt-wrt54gs-2.6-squashfs image from downloads.openwrt.org. </p><p>This is working great so far, although I am having a little trouble with the default firewall rules and an IPSEC vpn to the office.</p><p>The ipsec tunnel is established and the two remote networks can communicate after executing<br />/etc/init.d/firewall stop</p><p>I have tried adding numerous combinations of rules to /etc/firewall.user, all of which I will not post here. My last ( futile ) attempt was this:</p><p>### VPN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A INPUT -s x.x.x.x -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />iptables -A OUTPUT -d x.x.x.x -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 172.16.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.16.1.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT</p><p>The rules are being executed, as I can see them in the output of iptables -L -n, and the INPUT rule is effective as I can connect to all open ports on my router from the VPN gateway ( x.x.x.x ). I have come to the conclusion that I am missing something obvious. </p><p>Shorewall has made me lazy... but that&#039;s another subject.</p><p>I will keep banging away at this after I get home, however any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>[EDIT] I am using openwrt as the ipsec gateway, connecting as follows</p><p>192.168.0.0/24 &lt;----&gt; ( office router ) ---- internet ---- ( openwrt ) &lt;----&gt; 172.16.1.0/24</p><p>[EDIT] OpenWRT&#039;s internet connection is established via PPPOE, so the real WAN interface is ppp0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>centyx</strong> on 6 Jul 2007, 13:29)</p>

					<p>Still haven&#039;t figured this out. </p><p>The tunnel is still established, and oddly enough, I can actually ping my home lan (172.x ) from the office lan ( 192.x ) successfully, but not vice versa ( the outgoing packets never leave openwrt ).</p><p>Here are the current rules I&#039;ve added to /etc/firewall.user and some that I&#039;ve tried that didn&#039;t seem to make a difference:</p><p># allow all from remote gateway for now&nbsp;

After trying commenting out a couple things, I was led to the Masquerading section. </p><p>It occurred to me that the traffic from my local network to the remote network was being masqueraded, so I commented out the default masquerading line in /etc/init.d/firewall and added this in /etc/firewall.user:</p><p>[ -z &quot;$WAN&quot; ] || iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $WAN -s 172.16.1.0/24 -d ! 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>Now the two networks can communicate without any problem.</p><p>One thing I miss about Free S/WAN is that it used its own interface, ipsecX, for ipsec communication. That made things a lot easier.</p><p>So finally, here are all the rules I added to /etc/firewall.user</p><p>### WAN IP<br />WANIP=`cat /etc/ppp/current_ip`</p><p>### MASQ&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />[ -z &quot;$WAN&quot; ] || iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $WAN -s 172.16.1.0/24 -d !

					<p>In my previous experience with Linux IPSEC setup using ipsec-tools and racoon, the firewall rules were managed using shorewall. It will be interesting to see how shorewall handles this. </p><p>Not only does shorewall take an exceedingly long time to load on my wrt54gs, but the ipt_policy module is also missing, which shorewall requires for its IPSEC capabilities. </p><p>I will delve deeper into the shorewall way of handling IPSEC traffic in such a situation later, but for now I&#039;m just glad this is finally working.</p>									</div>
