					<p>I&#039;m running the Backfire 10.03.1-rc5 build and everything is working swimmingly with an HE 6in4 tunnel for outbound traffic.</p><p>Both the router and all clients on the internal LAN are able to access ipv6.google.com and pass tests at test-ipv6.com with no issues.</p><p>The last thing I need to get working is a few simple rules to open specific ports on a specific IPv6 address in the range assigned from HE.</p><p>I&#039;ve assigned the henet: interface to the pre-existing WAN zone in the LUCI firewall, and added the following rule, for example to allow HTTP inbound.</p><p>- <br />IPv6 only <br />TCP <br />wan:0.0.0.0/0:* <br />Device:2001:470:b:xxx::xxx:80&nbsp; (address obscured intentionally)<br />ACCEPT</p><p>(or in /etc/config/firewall speak,)<br />config &#039;rule&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;target&#039; &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;src&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_ip&#039; &#039;2001:470:b:xxx::xxx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;dest_port&#039; &#039;80&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;family&#039; &#039;ipv6&#039;</p><p>When I use the portscanner tool on HE to scan that particular address, it almost immediately comes back with the result that &quot;all 1000 scanned ports on ... are closed&quot;. I don&#039;t have to &quot;skip initial ping&quot; so something&#039;s obviously responding to ICMP, and I can indeed ping6 the address from the router successfully and I can wget to that address as well, so at least on the local LAN the connectivity is there.</p><p>I went through all the steps to ensure that forwarding is enabled between the tunnel interfaces via the sysctl.conf file, and other recommendations in the wiki, but I just can&#039;t seem to get any inbound traffic to test properly on the port scanning tool. Any suggestions would be appreciated!</p><p>Edit - Think I found my problem.&nbsp; The rules were set up by default for the destination to be the &quot;device&quot; - I had to explicitly change the advanced setting in the LUCI firewall UI to say the rule applied to the dest_ip on the LAN zone - then I get the expected results.&nbsp; - the config stanza needs an: &quot;option &#039;dest&#039; &#039;lan&#039;&quot; in it as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>andrewsi</strong> on 15 Aug 2011, 23:23)</p>

					<p>While previewing this, I noticed that you had already edited your message and have possibly found the solution. However, as I had this already ready, I am still going to post this.</p><p>Some ideas for you:<br />make sure that you have updated the default firewall config to better handle ipv6 control messages using icmpv6, as the default config rules were updated after rc5 was published. Check <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/backfire/package/firewall/files/firewall.config">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branche â€¦ all.config</a></p><p>I have Backfire with a 6in4 tunnel from Sixxs which should be rather similar as your Henet tunnel. I have configured ip6tables to allow a few ports, and they work ok. The traffic gets routed automatically just fine. </p><p>However, my rules do not limit the exact destination ip, but allow all traffic for the defined port to flow in. That is a difference compared to your wishes. </p><p>Using exact ipv6 address as a rule might also be difficult, as some operating systems (like windows 7) assign a regularly changing temporary ipv6 address that is used for initiating the outgoing connections. So, if somebody learns you ipv6 address that way, it is possible not the main address.</p><p>My config is below. Whole config has been done in /etc/config/firewall (but I also included the commented out /etc/firewall.user for showing the corresponding commands for that). The also includes one ipv4 to allow connection keep-alive check pings from Sixxs.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>BusyBox v1.15.3 (2011-08-13 16:01:01 EEST) built-in shell (ash)
