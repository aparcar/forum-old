					<p>While the official docs make no mention of &quot;proto ppp&quot; yet, the ppp package itself seems to be providing basic support for plain PPP (i.e. no PPPoE or PPTP) connections in /lib/network/ppp.sh. However it is currently not working due to the fact that, in case of &quot;proto ppp&quot; being used, the name of the network interface to be created is passed to pppd, which causes errors (in the PPPoE case, the rp-pppoe plugin uses this parameter). Also there seems to be no way yet to set the serial interface pppd should run on.</p><p>a) Are there any plans by others to complete this feature?<br />b) Any suggestions on the &quot;correct&quot; way to implement it?</p><p>(Just specifying &quot;option device /dev/tts/1&quot; or similar is of no use, since the &quot;device&quot; parameter is overwritten in /lib/network/config.sh&#039;s scan_interfaces().)</p>									</div>

					<p>Ouch, already fixed. Actually, it must be &quot;option ifname /dev/tts/1&quot;, then it seems to work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
