					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;m relatively new to openwrt and it&#039;s probably a quite easy problem...</p><p>I want to create separate networks on my router to separate my private network from my guest network and my development network.</p><p>The TP-Link Router I would like to use has 5 ethernet ports, but they just seem to be connected via an Atheros AR8327N switch to the routers main SOC. (I have also no idea if this is the correct order... just wanted to point out that I think I have a basic understanding of what is going on there)<br />I came to this assumption because openwrt says in the switch config are already two VLANs configured by default to separate LAN and WAN.</p><p>So port 0 is WAN and port 1 to 4 are LAN. Since the Atheros switch has 7 ports, one port is also connected to the SOC and I have no idea what the seventh port is connected to.</p><p>When I tell openwrt to create a new untagged VLAN on port 4 for example and use this as a new interface with a new static IP address in a different subnet, nothing happens. The router is basically unreachable via this port.</p><p>Am I missing something important? </p><p>Greetings and thanks in advance for helping me out.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>audiocore</strong> on 19 Aug 2015, 23:11)</p>

					<p>First on the switch set port 4 to off in all existing VLANs.</p><p>Next add a new VLAN such as three an assigned the CPU as tagged in three and port 4 as untagged in three.</p><p>Next on the WIFI screen add a wireless guest network to radio zero, one or both.</p><p>Next on the interface screen create a new bridge such as BR_VL3 and add VLAN interface eth1.3 and the <br />guest wireless network(s) to the bridge.&nbsp; You also assign the IP address and subnet of the bridge and <br />setup the DHCP server for the new subnet on this screen.</p>									</div>

					<p>Going from memory...see the Wiki page on the router for more detail... I believe there are TWO of the switch ports on this router connected to the CPU. In other words you can make connections from both eth0 and eth1 to the switch. There should be a table/chart on the OpenWRT wiki page for this specific router which shows the switch port to physical port mapping, they are not always so straightforward.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />thank you for your answers.</p><p>@jea101<br />As soon as I complete step two of your quickguide, assign CPU as tagged and port 4 as untagged, all the wired connections are not working anymore.<br />I also tried to assign the CPU only tagged VLANs and not a combination of tagged and untagged, but that also doesn&#039;t seem to work.</p><p>@BenFranske<br />Sadly I couldn&#039;t find something like a block-diagram for this particular model.<br />I found out some strange things:<br />The Atheros AR8327N is a 7 port ethernet switch and in the switchconfig menu I have a port labeled CPU and the ports 1-6<br />The firmware for the device was preconfigured like in picture 1.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rgxzKwc.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/rgxzKwc.png" /></span><br />This is kinda weird because VLAN2 seems to be used as WAN?<br />Just take a look at picture two... it really confuses the heck out of me.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OEYQb04.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/OEYQb04.png" /></span><br />&quot;Priv_Net&quot;, my LAN, has to be connected to eth0.1 AND eth1 otherwise it doesn&#039;t work... I have no idea why.</p><p>*EDIT*</p><p>Even if I just add a third VLAN without any assignments all the wired interfaces stop working.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>audiocore</strong> on 20 Aug 2015, 17:22)</p>

I think it will only work as a WAN/Gateway/Routing port. However, you can use the port marked as WAN (Labelled 1) on either eth1 or eth0 (Also, probably any other port could be used on either one, just not both at the same time.)</p><p>I don&#039;t know if my config is correct or not, but it does work, and it might give you some ideas!</p>									</div>

					<p>@makarel</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what you mean exactly by multiple WiFi vlans, but if you look at my config, I have several different WiFi SSIDs (I know, I didn&#039;t leave the SSIDs there, but each wifi-iface is a different SSID) with some associated with different VLANs.</p><p>I haven&#039;t truly tested performance or latencies. <strong>Do you have test method you&#039;ve used that I could emulate to give you comparable metrics?</strong></p><p>Anyway, on the subject, I do find the 2.4ghz channel&#039;s work great, and the 5ghz used to also work great (see next paragraph), but with limited range because of the old type lathe &amp; plaster walls in my dwelling.</p><p>After enabling the AC mode (VHT80) on the 5ghz channel, I experience with the bugs others have noted with the ath10k driver. It&#039;s pretty much useless. I think I will switch back off of AC mode to whatever is the next &quot;best&quot; mode it supports. Basically I can use it for a short while, and then it stops passing any traffic. The station remains associated, but nothing actually works. I find I have to reboot the router and disable and re-enable the wifi on my device to get it to work again. But that&#039;s just an endless cycle of insanity!</p><p>@all <strong><span style="color: blue">If anyone has found a solution for the 5ghz AC issue, please, by all means speak up!</span></strong></p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
