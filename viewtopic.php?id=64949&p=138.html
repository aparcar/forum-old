					<p>Hi all. I&#039;ve been having a persistent issue with OpenWRT/LEDE on my AC1200, and I haven&#039;t had much luck at all with determining a cause, partly because it&#039;s so difficult to come up with a successful search that describes my issues. Hopefully someone here can help me out.</p><p>Wifi works perfectly, absolutely no issues there. The wired connection however, doesn&#039;t work perfectly, and it doesn&#039;t work perfectly in some weird ways that make me think the issue is with the router. It connects without issue at 1Gps, both on a Win10 desktop machine and a Win7 desktop machine, both with hardware less than 3 years old. Both machines and the router are on UPS battery-backed outlets. Each machine will connect to the network instantly, find all network devices, initiate file transfers to each other and to a NAS, and for the most part, surf the internet with no problems. However, weird things happen when using the wired connection that do not happen on the Wifi connection: occasionally websites will fail to load, downloading large files will start, and then slowdown and completely stop: example, trying to download a iso from ubuntu.com or getfedora.com. File transfers between machines aren&#039;t &quot;smooth&quot;, they run at the max rate for a few seconds, then come to a stop for a few seconds, then run at the max rate, come to stop, etc. What makes it weirder is that if several transfers are running concurrently, they all work. Example: download an iso from ubuntu.com, wait for it to come to a stop, then start a test at speedtest.net, and the ubuntu transfer will start again, only to stop when the speedtest completes. Then start a file transfer between machines, and the iso download will start again. There are no issues like this when using the Wifi connection on the Windows 10 machine, or any other device that connects via Wifi.</p><p>This problem has persisted pretty much ever since I installed OpenWRT on this router about 9 months ago, across several different official and 3rd party builds. It took me a while at first to actually notice and figure out what was going on, and when I found out that my Win10 machine worked fine over Wifi, I put it on the back burner for a few months as it wasn&#039;t something that was really noticeable for the person using the Win7 machine which has only wired ethernet. Now, the Win7 machine&#039;s use case has changed and I need to get this issue sorted out.</p><p>The router is a WRT1200ACv2, and it&#039;s currently on Davidc502&#039;s 09/22 LEDE build, but like I said, this has persisted across multiple OpenWRT and LEDE builds, including NVRAM wipes and running with default settings. Any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jsosmond</strong> on 1 Oct 2017, 21:19)</p>

Then look at hardware like the cables or swapping out the PSU for the router. One more thing is that do you have your router close to any other electronics. Some times you can have interference from one devices to an other. I had this one time from a overclocked GPU to my wrt54gv2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapper</strong> on 1 Oct 2017, 23:02)</p>
