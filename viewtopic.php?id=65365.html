					<p>Hello. </p><p>I noticed that the input chain on my newly installed OpenWRT firwmare has the ACCEPT policy. I&#039;m not really a firewall expert, but to the best of my knowledge, this means that all traffic is passed through. Furthermore, the only rule in the input chain calls the &quot;delegate_input&quot; chain, which accepts incoming traffic that&#039;s in the state RELATED or ESTABLISHED. There must be something I&#039;m missing, because I would have thought that since all packets are accepted in the first place, there wouldn&#039;t be any reason to include this latter rule. </p><p>Another thing: I haven&#039;t set up any port forwarding, so any traffic originated from the outside (read Internet) should be dropped by the router. Is this correct? If so, the firewall is somewhat redundant when it comes to blocking traffic initiated from the Internet, as the lack of port forwarding implements the same functionality. Right? </p><p>Lastly, are there any changes I should make to the default firewall settings? I have a pretty ordinary home network, with some computers and smart phones accessing Internet, and I don&#039;t have any internal servers running. </p><p>Greetings,<br />kenneho</p>									</div>

					<p>The default policy is applied if none of the rules gets the packet before it reaches the default.<br />The &quot;RELATED or ESTABLISHED&quot; are temporary &quot;holes&quot; in the firewall that allows the WAN side respond to connections initiated by the LAN side. <br />The strength on the firewall is to prevent WAN from establishing connection, so new connection would follow the zone_wan_input --&gt; zone_wan_src_REJECT, and there you should see the counter running as it kicks attacks.<br />Port forwarding is actually poking permanent holes in the firewall (to expose servers).<br />No data can come in unless it has an open port by port forwarding or established session or udp temporary holes.<br />If you have another router you can use it as a higher subnet and nmap your OpenWRT WAN interface to examine the settings</p>									</div>

					<p>Thansks for the excellent replies! I see now that zone_wan_src_REJECT will prevent WAN (i.e. Internet) from initiating traffic into my network. </p><p>One last question: To allow WAN to establish connection, I&#039;d need to both set up port forwarding and configure the firewall to permit those packets?</p>									</div>
