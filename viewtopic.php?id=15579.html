					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m a noob and I&#039;ve spent the past week trying (unsuccessfully) to work out how to compile a kamikaze image for my NSLU2 that includes support for the VFAT filesystem and the cp437 national language set.</p><p>I&#039;ve got two questions I&#039;ve been unable to find answers to</p><p>1) I&#039;ve run make menuconfig -&gt; Kernel-Modules -&gt; Filesystems, and set every option to &#039;M&#039; to build a module.</p><p>After a build, the openwrt-kamikaze_7.09/build_armeb/root/lib/modules/2.6.21.6 directory doesn&#039;t contain any of the NLS modules selected above.</p><p>The openwrt-kamikaze_7.09/build_armeb/OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-ixp4xx-2.6-for-Linux-i686 directory contains only kmod-nls-utf8 kmod-nls-cp1250 kmod-nls-base</p><p>Unsurprisingly, when I try and mount a USB flash stick, the mount fails and dmesg tells me that the cp437 module couldn&#039;t be loaded (duh - its not there).</p><p>What am I doing wrong? Why is this module not being built and linked into the target flash image??</p><p>(Note: I&#039;m also trying to build the i2c support and have enabled both i2c kernel module options as &#039;M&#039; also. These modules are not appearing in the built image either. But I presume that when I solve the VFAT and NLS issue above, the same fix will work for my i2c module problem)</p><p>2) After re-running make menuconfig and changing something, I don&#039;t seem to be able to rebuild properly unless I do a make dirclean ; make.</p><p>This seems excessively wasteful, and I presume there&#039;s a simple way of updating the Makefiles (eg like running make dep when you rebuild a kernel). I can&#039;t seem to find any howtos telling me any more details about compiling than the basic &#039;run make menuconfig ; make&#039; - which is OK if you&#039;re building from scratch, but not what you want to do every time.</p><p>Thanks in advance.<br />Stefan</p>									</div>

					<p>Ahhh. There&#039;s always a simple explanation. Thanks!</p><p>And my other question.... if you go and change a config (to a &#039;*&#039; rather than an &#039;M&#039;), can you rebuild using &#039;make&#039; or is there something else to run first to reconstruct all the Makefiles?? I&#039;m wondering whether its been because I&#039;ve been compiling &#039;modules&#039; rather than packages that I&#039;ve not been noticing any changes in the flash-image....</p><p>Thanks again,<br />Stefan<br />-------------------<br />EDIT:</p><p>I&#039;ve recompiled using &#039;*&#039; instead of &#039;M&#039;. Some of the packages marked with &#039;*&#039; now compiled into the image, but others have not even compiled at all.</p><p>For example, I&#039;ve set the kmod-nls-cp437 (and several other code pages) in &#039;make menuconfig -&gt; kernel options -&gt; filesystems&#039; to &#039;*&#039;, but only nls_utf8 has been compiled and copied into the image. I&#039;ve also set both I2C options under &#039;make menuconfig -&gt; kernel options -&gt; i2c bus&#039; to &#039;*&#039; and neither have compiled at all (ie no evidence of the *.ko files under the build_armeb/linux-2.6-ixp4xx/linux-2.6.21.6&#039; directory.</p><p>There must be something else that needs tweaking / needs to be flicked on. Any ideas? (I&#039;ll update the nslu2 wiki when I get this sorted - I saw just now that the openwrt wiki already mentions that &#039;*&#039; and &#039;M&#039; mean something different - how many wikis do you need to read ;-))</p><p>Stefan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skellert</strong> on 8 May 2008, 03:21)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve just managed to get the nls_cp437.ko and nls_cp850.ko modules to build and install into the image.... I needed to run &#039;make kernel_menuconfig&#039; and enable the same nls modules there, as well as enable them in the top level &#039;make menuconfig&#039;. Result: I&#039;ve successfully mounted a VFAT USB stick on my NLSU2 for the first time.</p><p>Alas, I still haven&#039;t been able to compile the I2C modules. I&#039;m now guessing that they also need to be enabled in the kernel as well as the top level make. I tried this but it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>Any hints on what are the correct I2C modules to enable in the kernel?</p><p>Stefan</p>									</div>
