					<p>What are you doing with uClinux? I&#039;m also working on a project with it (WL-530G), and groz said he was going to be soon too...</p><p>Maybe we should discuss in detail what it might take to port OpenWrt to uClinux. I have already been creating firmwares for the WL-530G, and don&#039;t see any major show-stoppers for porting OpenWrt. Of course, not all packages will work off the bat and much work will need to be done in general, but it at least seems feasible.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also ran into this problem, for 7 days now (yes, I could have downloaded it even at 1KB/sec in that time ;p). nbd used axel to force the file from uclinix.org and set up a torrent.

					<p>I&#039;m sorry if I shouldn&#039;t do this, but does someone have &quot;m68k-uclinux-tools-20060615.sh&quot; or &quot;m68k-uclinux-tools-20060615.tar.bz2&quot; ? Because, from where I am, I just can&#039;t download it on &quot;uclinux.org&quot;, and I really need it. So if you have it, could you please send it to me or tell me where I can find it, or just do like for &quot;uClinux-dist-20060803.tar.gz&quot; and make it able to download. Thank you so much. I already downloaded this dist from <a href="http://80.81.183.101/uclinux">http://80.81.183.101/uclinux</a>, and it worked perfectly and was so fast. Thanks again.</p>									</div>
