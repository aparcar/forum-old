					<p>I just thought I would post about a recent repair I performed on my TP-Link TL-WDR4300.</p><p>I was using the wrong power supply (a simple transformer + rectifier + smoothing capacitor thing, not a switch-mode power supply), and after a few months, one of the power supply chips on the board failed.&nbsp; Because it failed low-impedance (and got hot as a result), it was easy to identify.</p><p>The chip is an Anpec APW7120.&nbsp; According to the datasheet, it is rated up to 13.4V in, and anything between that and about 16V is Absolute Maximum territory.&nbsp; It appears that my crappy WRT54G power supply was supplying a voltage too high for it to handle long-term.</p><p>I replaced the chip and it started working again.</p><p>The moral of the story is that you should always use a switch-mode 12 volt power supply.&nbsp; And, no, you also should not power it directly from a car, 12 volt solar power setup, or any other 12V lead-acid setup, because 14.1V &gt; 13.4V.</p>									</div>

					<p>I dont think so. The linear power supply is not a problem, the problem is that you do not use regulator transistor. When AC input increase, the DC output will be increase, plus rectifier/capacitor DC output will easily overvoltage. That is the problem.</p>									</div>
