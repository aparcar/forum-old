					<p>I&#039;d like to make use of an openwrt-running router to act as a 4 (or 5) port gigE switch and be able to monitor a USB-connected APC UPS.&nbsp; </p><p>We&#039;ve a generator here, so I don&#039;t need much in the way of capacity, just enough to keep the gear alive until the genset fires up.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve got a number of APC 350 and 550 units.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been going unmonitored for a while and eventually they need new batteries.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to have a heads-up on their battery condition before their little piezos start bleating like stuck pigs... in the middle of the night...</p><p>The idea occurred to me that since more consumer routers have a switch, what about combining the two?&nbsp; Monitor the UPS and act as a 4 port switch to local devices.&nbsp; Or 5 ports if the WAN port can be bridged.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Most of these are to connect a TV, so there&#039;s a DVR, possibly a streaming player or a receiver, and an iTach network IR emitter.&nbsp; Funny how the number of ports needed adds up these days.</p><p>Don&#039;t need wireless at all.&nbsp; I&#039;d just disable that in software if it was present.</p><p>I&#039;d be willing to spend more if it meant having better gigE switch throughput.&nbsp; Especially when it comes to blocking certain traffic, as their as some implementations of DLNA features that don&#039;t work and I wouldn&#039;t mind preventing them from being seen on the network.&nbsp; As in, you can&#039;t get network control without also enabling DLNA, but then anything on the subnet can see them (and send to them).&nbsp; It makes for messy lists on various tablets and phones as all sorts of devices are dynamically discovered.&nbsp; Being able to block that would be sweet, but it&#039;s not critical.&nbsp; If it meant spending a little more to get a router that was &#039;less slow&#039; at this I&#039;d entertain the upgrade.</p><p>Any suggestions on a stable solution to handle this?&nbsp; 4/5 ports gigE and USB to run NUT?</p>									</div>
