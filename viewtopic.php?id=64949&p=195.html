					<p>A new experimental build has been uploaded to the server and is ready to be downloaded. It is based on kernel 4.14.23. According to the latest commits, this is now the &#039;default&#039; kernel for our model series. Rather than just jump into it, I thought it would be a good idea to do some testing and hear feedback from users before making it a regular build. The last experimental build had wifi issues especially for V2 owners, so I&#039;m interested to hear if those problems continue of if they have now been fixed. I suspect they have indeed been fixed. </p><p>Patch 005 has been added to the build, so the very latest 3200acm hardware can enjoy this firmware as well.<br />I did not hack the wifi driver for the 1200acm this time. I&#039;m interested to hear from 1200acm users if they still experience latency or high ping times when playing games etc. If the issue continues, I will continue to make changes to the driver to accommodate 1200ac owners.&nbsp; </p><p>Kernel 4.14.23 with the latest wifi driver commit. <br /><a href="https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/snapshots/experimental/r6365/targets/mvebu/generic/">https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/sn … u/generic/</a></p><p>Sorry V1 owners, the reboot issue continues with this kernel.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 3 Mar 2018, 18:20)</p>
