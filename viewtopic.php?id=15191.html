					<p>Hi,</p><p>Recently I received an email from my internet provider saying my router is sending too many DHCP requests to their server.&nbsp; And I was given 48 hours to contact them to resolved.&nbsp; At the time I was using 7.09.&nbsp; I was told to update my firmware.&nbsp; I went back to Asus 1.9.7.5.&nbsp; After that, I gave them a call back to follow up if the problem fixed.&nbsp; But they said they don&#039;t have any tools to manual check that and the only way I know is wait and see if they are going to temporary disabled my account.&nbsp; So, instead of waiting for that to happen,&nbsp; my questions are.</p><p>- If anyone have a similar problem with version 7.09?<br />- Any knowledge of if Asus 1.9.7.5 have the same problem?<br />- Anyway on my side I can check?</p><p>I have Asus WL500gp.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p>									</div>
