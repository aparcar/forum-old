					<p>Dear all,</p><p>This is my first post here, so please be gentle.</p><p>I have a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54-1 router on which I installed WhiteRussian. I was using it as my main router for some time, but have now replaced it with a pre-N router.</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of selling the Buffalo on eBay, but what precautions should I take beforehand to avoid the risk I&#039;ll have left sensitive information on the router? I&#039;ll obviously need to give the buyer a new password, and I&#039;ll have to clear the whitelist of MAC addresses, but what else? Delete log files? If so, which ones? Command line history? Anything more?</p><p>Is there some kind of &quot;Restore WhiteRussian default settings&quot; command?</p><p>I&#039;m sorry if this turns out to be a noob question. I did have a look for answers to my questions but couldn&#039;t find any. If they&#039;re already written up and I&#039;ve just overlooked them, please point me in their direction.</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Restoring the default firmware (or putting the latest Backfire on it) would go a long way, you can clear nvram variables as well afaik (I don&#039;t know if WhiteRussian still uses nvram though).</p><p>WhiteRussian, even with a web interface, is horribly outdated, and chances are people looking for a second hand router won&#039;t know how to get it working.</p>									</div>
