					<p>1: &amp; 3: Because the traffic doesn&#039;t reach the iptables filters at all, I&#039;m sure it is passed out of the interface immediately because the router itself is not the destination, nor is another routed interface. Why should the kernel pass it towards the iptables filters then?</p><p>2: I don&#039;t know what Sveasoft has changed that it works with iptables.</p><p>4: Are the needed modules loaded? Have a look at lsmod and load them via modprobe if necessary.</p><p>Have a look here, there are links to several articles concerning ebtables / brigded firewall:<br /><a href="http://ebtables.sourceforge.net/documentation.html#docs">http://ebtables.sourceforge.net/documentation.html#docs</a></p><p>I did only a few tests with ebtables, but it did for me what you want to achieve, filter traffic on br0. Maybe it&#039;s suitable for you to disallow all client traffic by setting wl0_ap_isolate:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtNVRAM#head-f813f7e11d662f82e62ae3ae1e182f3ea24eb044">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtNVRAM#he â€¦ 3ea24eb044</a></p>									</div>

I have a case where I have a few ebtables rules and a few iptables rules too on a Asus WL500gx, the ping time changed from a few millisecond to a few hundred milliseconds. I did not pursue it to a level where I could have any conclusion but it might be the bridge is throwing up too many packets to iptables rules ( FORWARD ?). After I changed the rules a bit, it improves significantly but nevertheless the throughput is not as good as without ebtables modules.</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>
