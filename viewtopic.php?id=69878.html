					<p>Not sure if it&#039;s the way OpenWRT/linux works by default or an option to enable, but you could create a script to do just send an ARP every minute pretty easily.&nbsp; Something like:</p><p>mkdir -p /usr/share/arpping<br />vi /usr/share/gratarp/gratarp.sh</p><p><strong>#!/bin/sh</strong></p><p><strong>while :<br />do</strong></p><p><strong>#which interface to gratuitous ARP<br />interface=br-lan</strong></p><p><strong>#seconds between pings<br />interval=60</strong></p><p><strong>#gets the current IP address for the interface you specified above<br />ipaddr=$(ip addr show $interface | grep &quot;inet &quot; | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | awk -F&#039;/&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039;)</strong></p><p><strong>arping -A -I $interface $ipaddr -c 1</strong></p><p><strong>sleep $interval</strong></p><p><strong>done</strong></p><p>Then:</p><p>chmod 700 /usr/share/gratarp/gratarp.sh</p><p>vi /etc/rc.local</p><p>Add this to the file:</p><p>/usr/share/gratarp/gratarp.sh &amp;</p><p>Just an idea.</p><p>CB</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s handy to know about that I can tell linux to GARP. </p><p>Not sure why that&#039;s not working, I&#039;m not a dev, just a lowly network engineer.&nbsp; It could be for a different kernel version where the option isnt fully implemented in the one you are running, even though the option is set.&nbsp; It&#039;s also possible that you need to install a kernel module.&nbsp; I would submit that as a bug to OpenWRT.</p><p>Yeah, you might put it in hotplug.&nbsp; The only thing is getting the the right interface that came up to GARP on.&nbsp; Maybe grep/awk from readlog the most recent interface up pull that for the interface variable.&nbsp; You could also just create two scripts.&nbsp; Or even slicker you could also turn the garp ping into a function, run it twice with different arguments for the different interfaces.</p><p>Let us know how it ends up for you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sloppyTypist</strong> on 19 Feb 2017, 00:10)</p>
