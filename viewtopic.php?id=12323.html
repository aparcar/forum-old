					<p>I realize that support for AR7 is a Work in Progress, however I&#039;ve got a spare unit which I thought I&#039;d give it a go with.</p><p>I checked out Kamikaze from subversion last night and built it with appropriate options for AR7 hardware.&nbsp; I went through the instructions on the wiki, patched ADAM2 to accept non-checksummed firmware, then got FTP access easily enough, set up mtd5 as per the instructions (my current set of mtd&#039;s are the same as the wiki entry on the DG834G, so I used their numbers).&nbsp; Flashed the image into mtd5 and rebooted.&nbsp; </p><p>Watching the LEDs on the unit, the &quot;tick&quot; LED will flash on boot, (which is the period when I can access ADAM2), then go solid for about 2 seconds.&nbsp; Then it will flash 3 times in quick succession and then go out.&nbsp; The lights on the switch are flashing, however I&#039;m getting nothing from it.&nbsp; Not a single packet.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried scanning through 192.168.0.0/24, and also 10.0.0.0/24 (the subnet which it was part of before flashing, at 10.0.0.3), and I get nothing from it.&nbsp; </p><p>ADAM2 is still fine, as I can FTP into it as I have done before.&nbsp; Thank goodness I didn&#039;t bork the bootloader!&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried removing the wireless card to no effect.&nbsp; </p><p>I suppose the next step would be to hook up a serial cable to it and see what the output from the bootloader is during the boot process.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone has a known working kernel config for this particular device?&nbsp; Also, I noticed that the official netgear linux build is a 2.4 kernel, while Kamikaze is now 2.6.&nbsp; Could it be a possibility that I could try an older build which has AR7 support?</p><p>UPDATE: I&#039;ve found this: <a href="http://www.earth.li/~noodles/hardware-dg834g.html">http://www.earth.li/~noodles/hardware-dg834g.html</a> It says something about splitting the squashfs.bin file up into two, and writing over mtd0 and 1?&nbsp; That sounds... scary.&nbsp; I think this may well be a bit out of date, as it mentions something about a 2.4 kernel...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>naxxtor</strong> on 1 Sep 2007, 07:19)</p>

					<p>There could be many things going wrong here; get the serial console working first. It&#039;s likely that you are probably hitting this problem <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1858">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/1858</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Seeing how you can still get into ADAM2, you don&#039;t need to worry about serial console.&nbsp; Otherwise nabcore is right.&nbsp; Make the mofications in that ticket and rebuild another image.&nbsp; It should work.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>naxxtor wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>UPDATE: I&#039;ve found this: <a href="http://www.earth.li/~noodles/hardware-dg834g.html">http://www.earth.li/~noodles/hardware-dg834g.html</a> It says something about splitting the squashfs.bin file up into two, and writing over mtd0 and 1?&nbsp; That sounds... scary.&nbsp; I think this may well be a bit out of date, as it mentions something about a 2.4 kernel...</p></blockquote></div><p>Since you already created mtd5 (spanning mtd1 and mtd0), you don&#039;t need to worry about splitting the image.</p>									</div>
