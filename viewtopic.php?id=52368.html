					<p>I have a few questions</p><p>1.Is it possible to only allow my computer to be able to ssh to the openwrt router? The others can&#039;t get logged into it even with user name and password?</p><p>2.Is there a way to hide drop bear from luCI. so the others can&#039;t see it in luCI. But i can use the link to access it. It is currently listed in &quot;startup&quot; menu.</p><p>3.Is it possible to create a new user other than root for luCI. So they use different user names and passords. Currently the are the same so anyone who can login to luCI gets the ssh account at the same time.</p>									</div>
