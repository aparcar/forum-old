					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a problem with the reception of emails (through SSL) on workstations connected to my router running Kamikaze. The config is default, and the connection is through the router&#039;s wireless port. </p><p>I&#039;m using Micro$oft Outlook and getting following error :</p><p>&quot; Task &#039;xxx@xxx.com - Receiving&#039; reported error (0x800CCC0F) : &#039;The connection to the server was interrupted.&nbsp; If this problem continues, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).&#039; &quot;</p><p>I think, that the router blocks those emails for a specific time between the individual requests. That means, that I can download emails via port 995 (SSL) for a while, but after that (not measurable) I have to wait some time - ca 10 minutes (I&#039;m getting this error), and then it works again for a while.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Those problems are only with this specific router. If I&#039;m connected directly, everything works perfectly.</p><p>What should I do, please?! </p><p>Thanks in advance for your suggestions!<br />Ajo</p>									</div>
