					<p>Your router uses a MediaTek MT7260 per <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/TRENDnet_TEW-733GR">wikidevi</a>.&nbsp; I did a quick search and there are several routers in the openwrt database that use that chip set.</p><p>One caveat, that I became aware of when I put openwrt on a TRENDnet TEW-732BR, is that Trendnet used a validation code at the end of the firmware file.&nbsp; If the 733BR also uses a validation code, you will need to ensure that your openwrt firmware has an identical code for the first flash.&nbsp; Not sure that the validation code is still used as this <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/trendnet/trendnet_tew-810dr_1.0_1.1">entry</a> used a D-Link image and modified it for the Trendnet 810DR.&nbsp; You can look for the validation code, if there is one, by opening the factory firmware in a hex editor.</p><p>The Trendnet TEW810DR uses the MT7260 with a flash size of 8mb and RAM 64MB and presently does not work with 5mHz channels.&nbsp; This would be a good start - essentially you would have to verify the presense of a validation code from the Factory 733BR firmware, and if used,&nbsp; ensure that it is in the OpenWRT 810DR firmware.&nbsp; If the validation code is used you also would need to pad the file size to 16mb.</p><p>Here is a <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/latest/ramips/mt7620/">link</a> to other MT7260 devices that are supported by OpenWRT.&nbsp; None of the images have a 16mb size or are manufactured by Trendnet. </p><p>Another option would be to use the OpenWRT build system and build from scratch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 21 Feb 2017, 21:08)</p>
