					<p>I have AA RC1 installed on my AP, a TP Link WDR3600, and my STA, a TP Link WR841N, and have followed the Wiki guide to create a common broadcast domain:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p><p>The routers both list each other in the &quot;Associated Stations&quot; of the Luci overview page, but I am unable to ping the STA (which has a static IP address set, on the same subnet as the IP). In addition,&nbsp; the RX and TX rates appear low:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Signal: 5 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Noise: -83 dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RX Rate: 1.0 Mbit/s, MCS 0, 20MHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TX Rate: 48.0 Mbit/s, MCS 0, 20MHz [N.B. fluctuates between 1-48Mbit/s]</p><p>I have tried pinging the STA from a wireless client connected to the AP, and from the AP&#039;s console itself. In both cases the ping requests time out.</p><p>This is also the case when I have a wired connection to the STA, and am unable to ping the AP.</p><p>Are there some steps that I am missing before there is a unified subnet across the broadcast domain?</p><p>If not, are there any diagnosis tools that I can use to try to fix the issue?</p><p>Any help much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for taking a look nebbia.</p><p>I agree that the signal indicates that these routers are not interacting well at a hardware level. They are both set to tx power 27dbm (maximum) in the options. I&#039;d still expect there to be a transmission of tcp/udp packets over any type of reported link though.</p><p>After trying Barrier Breaker r36736 and getting the same result, I&#039;m ready to throw in the towel and state that the WDR3600 and WR841N are simply WDS incompatible under OpenWrt.</p><p>I&#039;m going to revert to the stock firmware for both and see if I can create a WDS network that way. If not, I&#039;ll return the WR841N.</p>									</div>

					<p>As I revert my firmware, I do recollect that the BSSID fields were blank in the Luci wireless settings page. This field was not mentioned anywhere in the wiki, so I left it empty for both AP and STA.</p><p>Should this field be populated?</p>									</div>

					<p>from what I remember only ssid was needed...</p><p>anyway the default 27 dbm it&#039;s a really high (maybe wrong? dangerous?) tx power..<br />i thought the max for these chips was 17 and i cannot understand why AA defaults to 27.... </p><p>were they working fine as simple AP&#039;s??</p>									</div>

					<p>They were operational as standalone APs.</p><p>After loading the latest official firmware on both the WDR3600 and the WR841N, I can confirm that WDS is still not functional between these two models.</p><p>I&#039;ll return the WR841N, and replace it with a second WDR3600.
