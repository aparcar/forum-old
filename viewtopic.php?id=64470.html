					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m starting a project for my home network after I got a TL-WDR4300.<br />I upgraded it&#039;s U-Boot to 1.1.4 with <a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod">pepe2k U-Boot Mod</a> and flashed OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05.1. After that, made a pivot root with an USB stick to help experimenting with custom builds (protection layer for flashing problems) and now I want to setup the network configurations.</p><p>This is the layout of my network:</p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/IlW2V8t"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IlW2V8t.jpg" alt="500x250" /></span></a></p><p>As you can see (if I linked it right), I have a lot of devices conected to the TL-WDR4300. I organized the network using Static IPv4 leases:</p><p>192.168.0.1 -&gt; Cable Modem (Since it can&#039;t be accesses by anything out of it&#039;s own network [192.168.0.0/24])<br />192.168.1.1 -&gt; TL-WDR4300<br />192.168.1.2~99 -&gt; LAN<br />192.168.1.101~199 -&gt; WLAN<br />192.168.1.254 -&gt; Printer</p><p>After that, I MAC filtered the WLAN to my devices only. In case of visitors (rare situation), I&#039;ll just grab their MAC and quickly add it to the list. DHCP can then assign a dynamic IP. I&#039;m still oblivious to how I&#039;m going to set IPv6 leases.</p><p>Well, what I need help with:</p><p>1. DHCP and DNS software:</p><p>I want a small cache DNS server and a basic DHCP server. Since I couldn&#039;t find cache options in dnsmasq, what package can I use? BIND9 ? If I end up using it, which package should I use for DHCP services?</p><p>2. Persistent DNS cache:</p><p>Since I want it to be persistent, it can&#039;t stay in the tmpfs. Is there a way to mount a persistent /tmp - /var in my USB stick and disable tempfs ? If not, can I change the place where the DNS server will save the cache file?</p><p>3. Static IPv6 leases.</p><p>I recieve a DHCPv6-PD IP (/64) from my ISP. With that, the router redirects 3 IP addresses to my devices.<br />A persistent global, a temporary global and an ULA. I want just a persistent global and the ULA for local communication. After getting rid of the temporary, I want to assign static leases to the global addresses. Is that possible or the ISP assigns them ? I&#039;m lost.</p><p>4. Firewall (IPTables/IP6Tables)</p><p>I want to control and log a LOT of things with this. Will my hardware take care of it? Or should I set a swap partition? With DNS/DHCP server, plus firewalling... 128MiB of RAM is enough? Plus, can I put the log files out of /tmp - /var too? I want them to be persistent.</p><p>That&#039;s some of the things I want to do. If you guys could help me, that would be awesome.<br />I&#039;m open to suggestions to modify the project or anything that facilitates the process with the same goal.</p><p>Thank you guys and awesome job on the OpenWRT project!</p><p>Gabriel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Mazzocato</strong> on 27 Apr 2016, 02:13)</p>

					<p>My two cents:</p><p>1 - As far as I know, DNSMASQ does cache DNS requests.</p><p>2 - Do you really need that? How often do you reboot your device? How long do those cached entries live? Have you detected a problem with DNS requests?</p><p>3 - No idea.</p><p>4 - I do not think you need more memory for your project, but you could need more CPU power, if you have a fast internet connection; you can always log into your router, and see how much memory / processor is being used. Watch out for your storage devices, as the frequent writes of /tmp or /var may kill them.</p>									</div>

					<p>1. chache-size and no-negchache are dnsmasq option that come to mind.</p><p>2. Persistent cache? Dns records may change and you don&#039;t want ever any update?</p><p>3. By default odhcp is used for dhcpv6, wouldn&#039;t know how to achieve that with it. If you install dnsmasq-full you can use /etc/dnsmasq.conf to do static leases or statefull dhcp.</p><p>What you currently see is likely SLAAC, with or without privacy extension.</p><p>4. Logfiles are written to where you configure the application to write them.<br />This can be an usb stick mounted on the device or can be sent over the network to a logging server.</p><p>Note: Static leases often aren&#039;t needed. You should be able to reach Desktop 2 from Desktop 1 via desktop2.lan assuming desktop2 is it&#039;s hostname.</p><p>Note2: 128m ram is plenty for almost everyone, sure there is the possibility that you will have to upgrade later but I clearly wouldn&#039;t worry until then.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the input. So...</p><p>1. I&#039;ll take a more in-depth look at dnsmasq then. Maybe I overlooked something on the wiki. I&#039;ll search other places too.</p><p>2. I plan to power cycle the router every sunday and I want the DNS records to update, yes.<br />What do you guys think I should use? Just cache the resolutions in tempfs and let it clear out on sunday? Will it update during the week? Sorry, never really worked with DNS servers. I just want name resolutions to be local and avoid WAN DNS lookups.</p><p>3. I&#039;ll check the statefull dhcp option.</p><p>4. I have a 60Mb internet link. I do large downloads via Steam and other places regularly. But I use a lot of low latency traffic too. I plan on setting TOS with iptables to help filter high-priority/low-latency packets.<br />Guess I&#039;ll keep monitoring the usage of memory and cpu to check if there is a bottle neck.<br />About the storage devices you mean the flash stick? Would you suggest to install a normal 7200rpm HDD in it&#039;s place?</p><p>Thanks a lot guys! Waiting on your replies ^^</p><p>EDIT:</p><p>@Max Hopper<br />4. When I say I want to control a LOT of things I mean mark, track and apply TOS to packets.<br />That isn&#039;t default in the f/w.</p><p>I&#039;ll check the manual for more input.

					<p>2. Usually after 5 to 15 minutes a record is considered stale and a new lookup will be performed. As such a reboot would be the same as not doing any queries for a couple minutes. A cache is only about performance and no means to avoid lookups over wan.</p><p>Maybe changing the upstream nameserver is the real solution to your problem.</p><p>4. Whatever suits your needs, though those cheap usb external hard drives aren&#039;t designed to be powered 24/7 and might live only a few years used like this.</p>									</div>
