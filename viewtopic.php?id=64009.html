					<p>raspberry pi in general is not a good idea as a router thing. unless youre running a internet connection lower than 10mbps. the reason for this is the USB is emulated, and emulation is nightmare CPU resource wise.</p><p>so while raspberry pi can handle 10mbps connection assuming you had 2 ethernet port (1 connected via USB port using a random USB LAN card or something) and 1 wifi dongle. Mr3020 can handle 60mbps connection just fine.</p><p>if your using as a get-ho torrent downloader thing, well raspberry pi is not a bad idea, I think. At least it can manage to download torrent at 3MB/s at best.</p><p>E ----</p><p>I still have my raspberry pi b+ that I put aside long time ago and decided to test it, torrent downloading is much more worst than the base raspbian installation, it works much better on arch linux though. Managed to get 4.7MB/s download speed with CPU maxed out, raspbian in somewhere 4.5MB/s while OpenWRT didnt even managed to get over 900KB/s, all based downloading a Ubuntu x64 iso torrent which is well seeded, tried downloading it on my NAS and it literally just gaves up at download speed of 35MB/s. Based on my 300mbit/s symmetric fiber line connection. </p><p>OpenWRT is no just optimized on this kind of miscellaneous things, but it does do excellent job on networking tasks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 8 Apr 2016, 14:35)</p>

I bet you probably 90% of tax money will end up in the pocket of the custom officer who handles the tax.</p><p>BTW, if you had friends who live here in the US planning to take a trip to your home town in Brasil, then you may want to ask them order an Orange Pi PC from AliExpress and it to you to avoid the import tax. Just make sure you give your friends plenty of time for the order to arrive into their post mailboxes. From my experience, it usually takes about 3 weeks once the order has been shipped to get to my post mailbox with a China Postal service. However, if the shipment uses ePacket (EMS), the package will arrive in less than 10 days once it gets shipped.</p>									</div>
