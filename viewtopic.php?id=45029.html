					<p>since there was no reply , I went ahead and:<br />--- re-flushed with Backfire 10.03.1...........same problem<br />---downloaded Backfire 10.03 and flushed .......same problem<br />---went back to Kamikaze 8.09.02 and flushed .........now both&nbsp; WinScp and Filezilla works fine !!</p><p>Looks like , in Backfire the ssh related files moved to a different ( non-standard) location and this is&nbsp; why WinScp and Filezilla can not find them.</p><p>Well, I neither have the time nor the knowledge to compare Kamikaze and Backfire regarding this issue, and try to fix it in Backfire.</p><p>So keeping Kamikaze, works well and does the job I needed the router for !
