					<p>Hi there,</p><p>A big thanks to everyone I&#039;ve seen contributing to this WRT1200/1900 support. I received mine 2 days ago, and am now able to have almost everything functionnal vs. an old Backfire/WRTG54L build it&#039;s meant to replace.<br />In those days of crazy UI changes (MS, I&#039;m looking at you), it&#039;s really good to see CC is almost similar to Backfire.</p><p>Quick one, after a lot of search and wiki scanning: I need to setup VLANs on my WRT1200AC for the 2 SSIDs of the wifi networks and I&#039;m super confused about the &quot;options &#039;ports&#039;&quot; params.<br />Back in the days of WRTG54, there were some mapping of physical ports to logical openwrt ports but obviously, things have changed with this Marvel chipset.</p><p>Can anyone post a 1200 network setup of a successfull VLAN setup ? Is it still needed to have tagging on the CPU (which port, used to be 5 on WRG54L). Also, what is the mapping between physical LAN ports (1 to 4) and ports as per the &quot;option &#039;ports&#039;&quot; keywords.</p><p>For example, I need to have 2 interfaces, one for VLAN 2 and one for VLAN 3 on port 4 of the WRT1200. They&#039;l then be part of different vswitches. How do you achieve this ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you see any text in putty? output from the router?<br />power cycle the router while the ttl is connected. If all the ttl pins are connected, you will see out put in putty.

That&#039;s to cover the whole house with the 2 WIFI networks ...<br />I&#039;m not gonna die if the feature is not here today, as this new gen router has quite more WIFI coverage, thanks to 802.11n (vs. 802.11g) but from a security perspective, it would make sense, as a target situation.</p><p>As I understand, It may not be here today, but possibly tomorrow ?
