					<p>Hello,</p><p>Just curious if it&#039;s possible to setup a OpenWRT device to act as a wireless ethernet bridge (convert a ethernet only device to support wireless) and have it act as a SAMBA server also at the same time?</p><p>I believe in the typical wireless ethernet bridge setup you lose access to the OpenWRT device acting as the bridge.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>kk</p>									</div>

					<p>Nope, the device still works on it&#039;s IP, it has just all the interfaces bridged together and no nat is done. It is better to set static IP, but dynamic shoukd work too. I have my wr1043nd v2 as samba server and dumb ap, vpn router, ftp server, web server and many other things at the same time with no problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> I use dumb ap mode, because openwrt does not support hardware nat, so it cannot nat gigabit traffic on a soho router.</p><p>Dump AP has only one disadvantage, you cannot forward ports from one to another, or listen to one port and send it to another ip. But it is possible to listen on ports and forward them anywhere using gnu netcat.</p>									</div>
