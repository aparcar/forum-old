					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am seeking any information I can find on making a router perform a number of tasks I no longer want to dedicate a computer to. Prior to this I had the Tenda N60 and Linksys E4200 v2.0, however, The former only runs tomato and the latter doesn&#039;t run anything (someone mentioned getting debian to run on it, but the website went offline so I can&#039;t do much with that). I went to the store, and found a decent router the TEW-818DRU, which attracted my attention because it included a USB3.0 port, which would help me incorporate my 2TB disk I wasn&#039;t fully using.</p><p>That being said, I haven&#039;t had much luck with DD-WRT, some things work, some things don&#039;t. My biggest issue is the lack of customization, but the mounds of conflicting information is also a drawback.&nbsp; I am interested in Open-WRT&#039;s package system, but I don&#039;t see a dedicated project or any mention of the TEW-818DRU (or any other router I have), however there are some other TrendNet routers listed that are virtually identical in hardware, and I thought I would ask about it before I assume it&#039;s not doable.</p><p>I am debating getting one of these routers to work or possibly purchasing yet a different one to complete the project. Right now I am stuck at making the decision.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is some support for the chipset in the Tenda N60, but no pre-built image available that I know of. Hard to comment at all about the Trendnet without more detail.</p><p>In general, Atheros is a much better supported platform on OpenWrt and I encourage you to get a router with such a chipset if you really want to use OpenWrt. There are several that are fairly inexpensive.</p>									</div>

					<p>drawz,</p><p>thank you for the feedback. there is a tomato image for the tenda, although I can&#039;t seem to find any build documentation which could be useful for trying to roll my own. I noticed some other people using tomato or generic linux installs on hardware to assist in overcoming specific challenges when installing.</p><p>Cost is not a huge motivator for me, but I really would enjoy getting something I already have here working. The dd-wrt completeness on the Trendnet does lead me to believe that should an image exist or be created for, it would be a decent vendor. Is there any documentation on what people did to start trying to build a new image? Especially those times where a minor revision in hardware was made and the porting to a new(er) version of a router with very similar hardware was accomplished by reusing an image and making minor changes. If I know how that is typically accomplished I can probably port some steps and re</p>									</div>

					<p>one of the reasons I like the OpenWrt development is that it&#039;s very open and well documented. You&#039;re seeing the downside of those other projects not doing that well now. </p><p>Sorry I can&#039;t help more, but there is some info in the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/add.new.device</a></p>									</div>
