					<p>Haha, no problem! But the mirrored stuff is not fully compatible (yet?) because of lines like this, which depend on the original repository: &quot;PKG_SOURCE_URL:=http://svn.luci.subsignal.org/luci/$(PKG_BRANCH)&quot;. So I guess it should fail at some point when it tries to download packages.</p><p>About your luci problem:<br />Well, all I can say is this works here: src-svn luci &lt;LINK DELETED&gt;<br />Perhaps this can help you in some way, dunno: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/29592">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/29592</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Cypher</strong> on 19 Mar 2012, 00:15)</p>

					<p>I ended up adding an additional mirror in a script (cant remember which one, but it had mirror2 in it) and pointed it to my web server. I tgz&#039;d the files from your mirror and hosted luci-0.10.0.tar.gz locally. I&#039;m not quite sure why the build process needs to get the files via svn... then later again in a zipped bundle. Either way I got it compiling.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>

					<p>It really freaks me out because they know about the problem since years and they did nothing! But the solution is as simple as adding a hourly cron job to check if apache is still alive and restart it if it&#039;s down!
