					<p>Some maybe thinking why I would want to turn the WRT to a switch.&nbsp; My network has *real* IP addresses and when I use the routing function on the WRT it takes away access from the local network because the router runs its own intranet.&nbsp; So I want to turn the WRT into a switch and have the wireless just work as an accesspoint.&nbsp; </p><p>How would I go about doing this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Basically, if you&#039;re using the original Linksys firmware, then just ignore the WAN port configuration.&nbsp; If you&#039;re using OpenWRT and need ipkg, then replace the default route to point at the same gateway as your other machines (otherwise you won&#039;t be able to get packets out on the Internet from the router itself).</p><p>Aside from that, basically all you need to do is plug one of the LAN ports into your existing switch (or use the box as the only switch on your LAN, and plug one of the 4 LAN ports into your router).</p><p>I have a similar setup, except that all the devices on this LAN have private IPs.&nbsp; I&#039;m not using the box as a router either, though, so I just plugged LAN port 1 into my main switch (edit: and set the default gateway).</p>									</div>
