					<p>Buy some cheap cables from a store that will easily accept returns. Connect them to your PC one at a time and lsusb each one. Also check dmesg to see if it&#039;s being detected as a serial adapter. (Make sure all the USB serial modules are loaded.) Finally, minicom the port, jumper RXD to TXD, and type text to make sure it echoes. Disconnect the jumper and make sure it no longer echoes to confirm. Keep the ones that work and return the ones that don&#039;t.</p><p>A proper RS232 adapter is pretty cheap as well and potentially more useful.</p>									</div>
