					<p>I have a situation... My firewall/router, which has been running OpenWrt pretty happily, may be dying.</p><p>I&#039;ve made some changes I&#039;d like to keep, but otherwise I&#039;m going to try and reflash with kamikaze.&nbsp; The problem is that I can&#039;t get into the router any more via ssh; it doesn&#039;t respond to pings.&nbsp; I can get it to respond in boot_wait though.</p><p>Before I wipe out the current image, can I use tftp to get a copy of the existing jffs partition, the one where my firewall script would be?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>--Yan</p>									</div>
