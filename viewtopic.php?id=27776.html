					<p>Now I read in a thread, that it was POSSIBLE to load open wrt. But it looks hard, and may brick the router. <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>This in mind, here are the approximate steps I followed:</p><p>- Build a custom u-boot. Apply the patch above to the sources in Netgear&#039;s GPL package, add staging_dir_mips/bin/ to your PATH, make ap81_config and make. The resulting u-boot.bin file can be flashed onto your device. Here&#039;s a binary build: <a href="http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/u-boot.bin">http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/u-boot.bin</a><br />- Install this u-boot image by telnetting into the device running the default firmware (telnetenable). Read other posts in this thread for information on how to do that. I found the easiest way to get the u-boot image to the device was via the &quot;snarf&quot; program Netgear kindly provides to download the image file from my webserver. Just run: snarf http://yourserver/u-boot.bin (if your router has web access you can even use my direct url above). Then install it: mtd -e mtd0 write u-boot.bin mtd0. Be patient, if you&#039;re not careful, you will brick your device right here, and the only way to get it back is likely JTAG. Any other part you screw up can be recovered with a serial console, but if you screw up the bootloader you are in trouble.<br />- Build OpenWrt. My config: <a href="http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/config">http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/config</a> (beware there are some things in here you probably don&#039;t want like custom IP address defaults and ppp disabled). I&#039;d recommend also editing target/linux/ar71xx/config-* and setting CONFIG_CMDLINE=&quot;rootfstype=squashfs console=ttyS0,115200 board=WNR2000 panic=10 init=/etc/preinit rootdelay=2 -- &quot; which *should* eliminate the need to mess around with u-boot&#039;s environment (not easy to do under the default firmware unless you have a serial console). Otherwise you&#039;ll need to use a serial console to edit U-Boot&#039;s environment (which also breaks the ability to flash back to the default firmware). Binary images are at the end of this post.<br />- Install it. You can flash from the default firmware by snarfing the lzma uImage and root fs, then flashing: mtd -e mtd2 write root.sqfs mtd2 &amp;&amp; mtd -e mtd4 write uImage mtd4<br />- Install OpenWrt&#039;s u-boot preferences. I&#039;m waiting until this point, because this will likely break your ability to go back to the default firmware. Using the same format as the above commands but while still booted into the default firmware, flash <a href="http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/ubootenv.img">http://fuhry.co.cc/b/wnr2000/ubootenv.img</a> into mtd1 using the same format of command as above.<br />- If you built OpenWRT from source, use the squashfs 4k image. Ensure it&#039;s &lt;2304k. Anything left over will go to your jffs2 space.<br />- Reboot!</p><p>I&#039;m not responsible if anything done here bricks your router. These exact images haven&#039;t been tested, because I repartitioned my router to maximize the space I got in jffs2. But the general process has been pretty thoroughly tested. If you&#039;re interested in hacking the kernel sources and messing with the u-boot environment, my mtdparts are: &quot;mtdparts=ar7100-nor0:256k(u-boot),64k(u-boot-env),2816k(rootfs),896k(uImage),64k(ART)&quot;. Please note that repartitioning should NOT be required. You get about an additional 500k of space out of it though.</p><p>-fuhry</p></blockquote></div><p>These look like the steps, but I&#039;m a noob to everything router related and think I&#039;m going to need help.</p><p>What is a U-Boot?<br />What is telnetting?<br />In step 1, is that binary build pretty much what he said to make?<br />What is snarf?<br />What is serial console?<br />I see mention of a custom ip? Is there a way to get a build without a custom ip?</p><p>Yeah I know a lot of questions...I just want openwrt support lol</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaivorth</strong> on 20 Dec 2010, 01:02)</p>
