					<p>I had the same problem with my WR842ND.</p><p>I was using kernel 3.8.13 (r36802) and flashed the update of June 22 (snapshots/trunk/ar71xx) and bricked my router.</p><p>Hopefully there is a wonderful guide (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953</a>) about how to unbrick it.</p><p>I thought it was me that did something wrong and tried to re install all, but same behavior (I didn&#039;t up to 3 times with sysupgrade and factory), so reading your email, I guess there is an issue with the latest upgrade.</p><p>If someone could confirm, I&#039;m stuck with the old version and not willing to try again until a new version comes out.</p>									</div>

					<p>Gonzzo, as I mentioned r37015 works fine.<br />only drawback is that I lost all high 5GHz channels for unknown reason, but it&#039;s not a dealbreaker for me</p>									</div>
