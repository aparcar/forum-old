					<p>You don&#039;t need different patches for different phys - you have to set up the phys right - not to mention that you also have to set up the gpio lines for pci and some other stuff.<br />Don&#039;t &quot;hack&quot; a different board&#039;s support code, but rather add your own for the above reasons.</p>									</div>

					<p>so then openwrt does support various ixp425 boards, then there must be several variations of the mdio /mii code ?<br />will check the existing/working 2.4 code for hints on how it works, and why the mdio/mii 4xx code from openwrt does not</p><p>the existing code DOES show packets coming in.. so some minor fix is needed</p>									</div>

					<p>the intel NPE supports DSP services , has any of this been made available in the openwrt port ?<br />i guess one must, scrape over the exising intel ixp400 library to re-create a similiar set of DSP <br />services.</p><p>perhaps getting the intel sw to work in place on openwrt, then part by part replacing it with open source<br />will be a way forward</p>									</div>
