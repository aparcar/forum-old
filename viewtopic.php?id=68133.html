					<p>Hi.</p><p>I recently configured my environment to compile and test OpenWrt using the new Git repository (<a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt</a>)</p><p>I cloned, updated and installed the feeds, selected my target as Lantiq -&gt; XRX200, added the xDSL drivers and the ATH9K kernel modules.</p><p>Everything compile file and Installed on my device without problems.</p><p>ADSL worked file but Wireless didn&#039;t. I looked carefully in the logs and I don&#039;t see anything suspicious. But the Wireless is always showing as &quot;Disabled&quot; on the lUci interface.</p><p>Strangely, if I use the &quot;Scan&quot; feature on the Wireless GUI, I can see my neighbors Networks, so, it seems that the Wireless adapter is working somehow, but, I&#039;m not able to make it as a AP. </p><p>Some months ago, I compiled OpenWRT using the old repository and Wireless worked fine, so, this leads me to think something in the new repository configuration is making it now work.</p><p>At this point I&#039;m clueless of where/what should I look for to fix this. </p><p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>									</div>
