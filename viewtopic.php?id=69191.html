					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a setup Huawei E8372H + OpenWRT and I&#039;m trying to add Custom DNS servers either in DHCP/Static Protocols of WAN interface.</p><p>The Huawei modem is at WAN1 (eth1) interface. So I&#039;ve tried the following steps.<br />Changed the OpenWRT settings.<br />As a safety measure removed all other custom DNS settings in the OpenWRT as well as other clients<br />Changed the WAN interface to Static <br />IPV4 address: 192.168.8.2.<br />Netmask: 255.255.255.0.<br />Gateway: 192.168.8.1<br />DNS 1: 199.85.126.10 (used Custom DNS)<br />DNS 2: 199.85.127.10<br />• Finally Save &amp; Apply.<br />As soon as the changes took place I can see them in overview like this <a href="https://s25.postimg.org/57rg6ge27/2017_01_02_08_41_04.png">https://s25.postimg.org/57rg6ge27/2017_ … _41_04.png</a></p><p>Changed the Huawei Hi-Link modem settings as below.<br />- Disabled the DHCP server in the settings <a href="https://s25.postimg.org/c0rt2q4vj/2017_01_02_08_43_44.png">https://s25.postimg.org/c0rt2q4vj/2017_ … _43_44.png</a><br />- Next to avoid Double NAT, followed this E3372 guide as it also applies to E8372<br /><a href="https://protyposis.net/blog/using-the-huawei-e3372-hi-link-lte-dongle-with-openwrt/">https://protyposis.net/blog/using-the-h … h-openwrt/</a><br />Finally, connected the modem to the OpenWRT router and my Internet is up.<br />To test the DNS I can check either by CLI or by visiting some phishing sites. Using the Norton DNS servers will eventually block the phishing sites. Then from the OpenWRT command, there are 3 commands that I used to confirm the changes.<br />1. nslookup google.co.uk<br />This should return something like this <a href="https://s25.postimg.org/wz6p8x2jz/2016_12_31_033421.png">https://s25.postimg.org/wz6p8x2jz/2016_12_31_033421.png</a><br />This means OpenWRT is acting as DNS resolver which I think is a good sign. In next step, I used another command to see what DNS the OpenWRT is fetching.<br />2. Knowing that in OpenWRT there are 2 files that work on DNS, they are called resolv.conf and resolv.conf.auto where both are symlinked. In the command line to check the contents of both the files, I used following commands.<br />- cat /etc/resolv.conf <br />Result : nameserver 127.0.0.1<br />- cat /tmp/resolv.conf.auto<br />Result: # Interface wan1<br />nameserver 199.85.126.10<br />nameserver 199.85.127.10<br />3. I also tried visiting some phishing websites which proved Norton DNS blocking.<br />Finally, after using the internet for few hours I unplugged 2-3times to test other things but in this process, I found that the WAN interface is reverting back to DHCP after every reboot/power loss. And I had to reconfigure the static IP to use the internet.</p><p>With all these tries finally I decided to seek help and acquire some knowledge here. I now have few questions which require detail answers for understanding. Hoping someone can answer them I&#039;m putting the questions below.<br />1. What would be the reasons causing the automatic protocol change in WAN interface after every reboot?<br />2. Am I doing the correct DNS setup or is there any better alternative which I&#039;ve to follow?<br />3. Do you think I&#039;ve to stick with DHCP protocol and use a different way to configure DNS?<br />4. Finally, can anyone explain how the custom DNS work in OpenWRT and what&#039;s the importance of both resolv.conf and resolv.conf.auto files and how to handle them?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>i0s</strong>, I don&#039;t understand your problem. You can specify WAN DNS, you can also specify LAN DNS for DHCP in another place. Yes, /tmp/resolv.conf.auto is the file where current DNS set of router (WAN DNS) is saved. If you specify WAN DNS manually, it should persist after reboot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 3 Jan 2017, 13:28)</p>

I think I&#039;ve made a detailed post. I understand we can use custom DNS on both LAN and WAN. But one of my main questions is why the WAN protocol changes automatically from static to DHCP after reboot.</p>									</div>
