					<p>The paper has now been released, it&#039;s at <a href="https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/ccs2017.pdf">https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/ccs2017.pdf</a></p><p>The most important part (I guess):</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>6.5&nbsp; Countermeasures<br />Key reinstallation attacks can be mitigated at two layers. First, the<br />entity implementing the data-confidentiality protocol should check<br />whether an already-in-use key is being installed. If so, it should<br />not reset associated nonces and replay counters. This prevents our<br />attacks, at least if an adversary cannot temporarily trick an imple-<br />mentation into installing a different (old) key before reinstalling<br />the current one. In particular, when using this countermeasure it is<br />essential that the replay counter of received group key handshake<br />messages only increases. Otherwise, an adversary can use an old<br />group message 1 to make a victim temporarily install an old (differ-<br />ent) key, to subsequently reinstall the current group key using a<br />more recent group message 1.</p><p>A second solution is to assure that a particular key is only in-<br />stalled once into the entity implementing the data-confidentiality<br />protocol during a handshake execution. For example, the generated<br />session key in a 4-way handshake should only be installed once.<br />When the client receives a retransmitted message 3, it should reply,<br />but not reinstall the session key.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>Dear MODERATORS can we please have this thread sticky? It is really a security issue rendering the Wireless security useless on both OpenWRT and LEDE.</p><p>On my original question, will OpenWRT CC (last version) get a security patch? LEDE, while interesting and actual, doesn&#039;t fit in the 4MB flash / 32 MB RAM 20-30USD/EUR routers that are still mainly sold or received from the provider.<br />There are some unofficial LEDE compilations for these routers, but they are not really stable and trustworthy (security). ATM you cannot really force the acquisition of exotic/expensive routers while the market dictates differently. </p><p>This WPA2 security issue, while fresh and still &quot;academic&quot; will promptly turn into hacking tools available everywhere, kids will start to take over all the APs around pretty soon.<br />Either patch OpenWRT or squeeze LEDE (build a light version) while preserving basic functionality to fit the 4MB flash / 32MB RAM devices.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>justme123</strong> on 16 Oct 2017, 23:51)</p>

					<p>Hello. I have an older build of OpenWRT, which I couldnt upgrade anymore, because of the LEDE switch. It is a custom build of OpenWrt Designated Driver r49296. The only upgrades I did since then were:</p><p>libopenssl to 1.0.2j-1<br />libpolarssl to 1.3.17-1<br />dropbear to 2017.75-1</p><p>All other packages are still from r49296 (around Q1 2016 I think).</p><p>Is it enough if I do an opkg upgrade wpad-mini hostapd-common? It is version 2016-01-15-2 right now. Will this even work, or is there a (high) chance it will break anything? Is wpad-mini 100% standalone or does it relay on other updated things too, like the kernel? hostapd-common is 2016-01-15-2. Kernel is 4.1.23-1. Dnsmasq is 2.75-7. The router just has SSH port open to the WAN, so I didnt see any reasons to upgrade to LEDE yet.</p><p>wpad-mini is btw still this old version on the trunk tree for ar71xx: wpad-mini_2016-06-15-1_ar71xx (build date 16-Oct-2017 09:08)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 17 Oct 2017, 03:13)</p>

					<p>Wpad-mini is a simple package, one executable file and two symlinks that make aliases for it.&nbsp; The main binary, wpad, will serve as either hostapd or wpa_supplicant depending on how it is called.</p><p>Pull the wpad binary out of a new version then replace your /usr/sbin/wpad with it, keeping the old one in a safe place of course.&nbsp; If that breaks the wireless, copy back the old version.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just did an &#039;opkg upgrade wpad-mini hostapd-common&#039; and a reboot and wifi is still working fine it seems. I am now on hostapd-common&nbsp; &nbsp; 2016-06-15-1 and wpad-mini&nbsp; &nbsp; 2016-06-15-1, so are these patched? Why are they though called 2016-xx-xx? So would I need to wait for a 2016-06-15-2, but it&#039;s not up yet it seems? Or is the xx-1 the new patched one already?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 17 Oct 2017, 03:30)</p>

					<p>No those are probably not patched. LEDE has been based on version 2016-12-19, with -4 being the the last release and a just released -5 includes the anti-KRACK patches.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, look at the link above by wigyori, it seems to be patched (based on 2016-06-15), but I cant link links... I cant even link pictures here. It says for the last two changes for hostapd for OpenWRT:</p><p>1.<br />CC: hostapd: update to version 2016-06-15<br />nbd168 committed with wigyori on Jun 15, 2016<br />@wigyori</p><p>2.<br />CC: hostapd: fix WPA packet number reuse with replayed messages and k…<br />wigyori committed 12 hours ago</p><p>CC: upgrade hostapd to 2016-06-15, include KRACK fix </p><p>So I guess the 2016-06-15-1 file is patched, no? Or would it be a -2?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 17 Oct 2017, 03:34)</p>
