					<p>I tried the templates/create_new_page things... very nice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Based on: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58633">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58633</a><br />I created first a data entry page, and from there I clicked create_new_device_page.</p><p>Result:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/asus/asus_dsl-n16u">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/asus/asus_dsl-n16u</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/asus_dsl-n16u">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/asus_dsl-n16u</a></p><p>A few minor comments:<br /> 1) The version filter ~~ something did not work right away (I left version empty). However, by removing the version filter entirely from the Device Page I got it to work.<br /> 2) It was great that the create_new_device_page existed directly on the data entry, but later I of course hade to update that field manually (ok, I have to do some actual work, I get it).</p><p>About the device page... I am reluctant to &quot;all the information&quot; in the template. It is a template, and it should all be there. But when I have just created a new page... perhaps I dont know much, but it is anyway good to create it... for the READER it is confusing with so much template text and so little actual content.</p><p>Under Hardware... that is not supposed to be there in the template but rather being fetched from the Dataentry (most of it at least)?</p><p>I don&#039;t really have a better option to the template... but could we be more clear about what is template instructions... make it italic? make it red? make it blink?</p>									</div>

					<p>On the definition... I&#039;d prefer a positive match: that it should match 10.03, 12.09, 14.07... but I understand the disadvantage. So I think your filter looks good. Hopefully, in the future, we will have less garbage in that column and we can remove some of the negative conditions. Ideally, it should contain a supported version, or be empty, right? (now that we have the Unsupported field for unsupported status)</p><p>Yes, with &quot;all the information&quot;, I meant everything that do not come from the dataentry. There were some section, like the &quot;switch&quot;, that I think was particularly tricky. You (or @richbahnover) already did a quite good job with adding &quot;FILL-IN&quot; most everywhere. Perhaps with a second review it is good enough. From another perspective, the wiki should not contain plenty of irrelevant text (thinking about search engines and stuff). So, perhaps the template page should be very minimalistic, but with a link to a rich template page to copy sections from. @richbhanover - have we already talked about this and agreed?

Any volunteers?-)</p></blockquote></div><p>I am trying to find a new job, and easily distracted (as you can see).&nbsp; I am not sure I can help, but I think an acceptable practice would need to be defined first.&nbsp; My next post is a framework that addresses this.&nbsp; I think it may need to be internal, but I do not know what &quot;internal&quot; is in this environment.&nbsp; Some of this would be easy with workflow tools.</p><p>Regarding the Techdata content: <br />How does the Device Page differ from the WikiDevi URL.&nbsp; <br />It may be easier to maintain OEM support Page than a OEM firmware link.<br />Please also consider adding a link to the FCC Info for the device. (does this differ by country?)</p>									</div>
