					<p>ok, I am thinking of buying a new router (simply cause my old one sucks...)</p><p>I find these routers with AR7 chipset especially appealing, just because it has an <br />integrated adsl modem. This would mean, that i can use QoS without have to shape the ustream <br />to something below 128k (please correct me if i&#039;m wrong) cause the driver will ask the kernel for<br />a new packet when the current one has been sent, just like if the ethernet link was only running at 128K.</p><p>Again: please correct me if i miss someething and some driver or hardware of does implement it&#039;sown fifo.</p><p>but i really want to customize my kernel so that i can add QoS features!</p><p>my alternatives are currently as follows:</p><p>a) D-LINK DSL-562T : the most appealing one cause it&#039;s only euro 51,-. no wlan or switch thou<br />b) NG DG834B: the DG834GB without WLAN. euro 61,-. no wlan, but has a switch<br />c) NG DG834GB: that`s what it`s all about here... it`s ANNEX B so this is why it`s called GB.</p><p>all three are annex b, ie the dlink is like a 502T but has annex b instead of annex a.</p><p>another thing: i have a switch lying around, so i do not need the built in switch of NG.<br />but on teh other hand, it would be nice to have one box less lungering around.<br />i neither need wireless, but if i go for the netgear, it`s only euro 15,- extra. if it will be supporte in the near <br />future, i might get the wireless, just in the case i get a notebook some day.</p><p>So my questions:</p><p>a) will the annex b stuff hurt? are there differences in the hardware (like other hybrid) that will preven adsl from working?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (of course i need ADSL)</p><p>b) which one would you suggest ? i heared of problems with ng due to checksum computation in the adam2 of teh dg834gb.<br />c) will wlan be supported ?<br />d) will it be hard (= recompiling kernel) to support QoS?</p><br /><p>thanks in advance, tom</p>									</div>
