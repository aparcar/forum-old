					<p>You are right, this would really restart wifi every minute after first tx dma occurence <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I never noticed that because I invoked the script only once in a longer period <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Luckily I don&#039;t need it anymore, I run into tx dma long time ago, maybe yet on AA.</p><p>It would be probably better to test iwinfo wlan0 assoclist and when noone is connected, restart of wifi would not hurt.

					<p>I have a lot of trouble on a TL-WR2543N with wifi disconnects, too. As the bug seems not fixed the idea for a restart script maybe will keep the wifi incidents short.</p><p>I put a little bit of logic and checking into a script and testing it on my router in crontab every minute. It keeps the number of lines from dmesg output in file /tmp/dmesg.lines. If number of lines is greater then last run it checks the new lines for string &quot;Failed to stop TX DMA, queues=0x004&quot;. If string was found wifi will be restarted.</p><p>Here is my script:<br />=======================================<br />if [ ! -s /tmp/dmesg.lines ]; then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo 0 &gt; /tmp/dmesg.lines<br />fi</p><p>OLINES=$(cat /tmp/dmesg.lines)<br />NLINES=$(dmesg | wc -l)</p><p>if [ $NLINES -gt $OLINES ]; then <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; let GLINES=$OLINES+1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if dmesg | tail +$GLINES | grep -q &quot;Failed to stop TX DMA, queues=0x004&quot;; then <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wifi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; fi<br />fi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />echo $NLINES &gt; /tmp/dmesg.lines<br />=======================================</p>									</div>
