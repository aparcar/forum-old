					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>First, I want to apologize for the newb question of the day...</p><p>I&#039;m purchasing a new DEV router for OpenWRT and am trying to find which one for under $100 would provide me with the most features to play with.&nbsp; On NewEgg I can get refurbs for much less and don&#039;t have a problem with getting one of those unless someone on here has had a gbad experience.&nbsp; </p><p>Before you say &quot;just Google it...&quot; or give me a link to the buyer&#039;s guide, I have done both.&nbsp; I found such a broad array of answers on Google (which confused me more than anything) that I thought I&#039;d post.</p><p>I&#039;m not planning to use this router in production, but simply to play with different features available.&nbsp; After doing so, I&#039;ll probably use it for VPN access to my house when traveling.</p><p>Any Ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the best choice, but I think Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H or WZR-600DHP (they are basically the same), are a pretty good choice. Plenty of flash (32MB) to install packages into it and not use extroot, 128MB RAM, Dual Band (Atheros), Gigabit LAN, USB. This is pretty much all you need from a single device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks Guys - </p><p>After a bit of research and reviewing the posts suggested, I think I may go with the Buffalo N600 as it seems to be able to handle all of the features.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
