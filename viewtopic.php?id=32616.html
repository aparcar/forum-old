					<p>I have built a few custom themes and some&nbsp; modules for my kamikaze builds, i have successfully compiled my ipk packages and built the image, everything builds fine and loads to my WRT54G just fine. The only problem is the restart function does not work for my application, i can start/stop and restart it manually just fine. I have found the problem seems very strange, for some reason my &quot;lotus.sh&quot; file, which is the startup script for my app is not being recognized, its there is the lotus directory as it should be, it is green indicating the permissions have been set, but when i try and start it manually i gives me the following error...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# cd /lotus
root@OpenWrt:/lotus:/# ls
lotus.openwrt-bcm947xx          lotus.conf            lotus.sh
root@OpenWrt:/lotus:/# ./lotus.sh
/bin/ash: ./lotus.sh: not found   &lt;-------------------------does not see the file ??
root@OpenWrt:/lotus:/#</code></pre></div><p>So could some please explain to me the proper procedure to add my files to the build before i compile them,&nbsp; i think that is where i am going wrong. </p><br /><p>The directories and files i need to add are the following:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lotus - i need to add this directory to the main route directory with the following files and permissions</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lotus/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-lotus.openwrt-bcm947xx - this is my custom app already compiled into a mipsel binary, this file must have +x permissions set<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -lotus.conf - this is just the user configuration file for my app, no permission are needed here </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -lotus.sh - this is the start up script, it must have +x permissions set awell, to restart the program, I can rm lotus.sh and scp it back into the lotus dir,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;then chmod +x it and it works fine, so i no my code is solid, its just a matter of loading it correctly.</p><br /><p> So if someone could please explain to me how to properly go about this,I am building openwrt kamikaze with the 2.35.4 kernel, compiling on ubuntu 11.04&nbsp; 64_biit any <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Thanks</p><p>Teara</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>teara</strong> on 27 Oct 2011, 01:11)</p>

					<p>The way i am adding the dir and folders to my build, is by adding a directory called &quot;files&quot; to my top dir , then putting the files i want to include inside this folder, everything compiles perfect, but my lotus.fs file will just not load correctly. I can see it there, i can even vi it and see the contents of the file, but it is not being found when i try to execute it ???</p><p>please help me .....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>teara</strong> on 27 Oct 2011, 18:09)</p>

					<p>here it is, and again everything seems in order ...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ls -l /lotus

I figured it may have something to do with using the &quot;files&quot; dir in the top dir to load them in the build, so i have now removed the files folder and i have added the files to the lotus module and created the postinst to set the permisions for the file, but i get the exact same results. Also I have a lotus file in init.d dir for auto start that calls the louts.sh in the /lotus dir, and when i try and manually start it there i get...</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/init.d# ./lotus start
/etc/rc.common: eval: line 13: /lotus/lotus.sh: not found
root@OpenWrt:/etc/init.d#</code></pre></div><p>Thank you for you help with this, i am really puzzled as to why only the .sh file is affected , the binary itself and the modules all work fine,&nbsp; the lotus.sh file is like me in class, there... but not really there lol.</p><p>Teara</p><p>**Update**</p><p>Well i have spotted the problem, during the build my .sh file is being modified, ^M is being added to the end of every line in my sh file, here the begining of the file for example</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh^M  &lt;--------
LOTYPE=`grep lotus /etc/config/lotus/lotus | cut -f 2 -d =`^M  &lt;------------------ 
^M &lt;--------------------
if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep lotus.bcm947xx^M &lt;---------------
then^M  &lt;-------------

 this should look like

#!/bin/sh
LOTYPE=`grep lotus /etc/config/lotus/lotus | cut -f 2 -d =`

if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep lotus.bcm947xx
then</code></pre></div><p>i am guessing the ^M means new line or line break or what have you, but why is this being added to only the .sh file? </p><br /><p>Teara</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>teara</strong> on 28 Oct 2011, 00:43)</p>

					<p>yes i am thinking it may have something to do with the fact that i built the .sh file in notepad++ in windows, so notepad++ is default program to open the file, then being lazy i just accessed my windows drive from my ubuntu to grab the file, and then stuck it in the build. </p><p>**update**</p><p>You were bang on as usual Jow, i redid the .sh file in ubu gedit and recompiled, worked right away. I will remeber that for sure. thank you for you assistance</p><p>cheers,</p><p>Teara</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>teara</strong> on 28 Oct 2011, 08:35)</p>
