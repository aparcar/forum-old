					<p>^thats preety much what your router can handle. the cpu that router uses is not designed to do this kind of task to be honest. That&#039;s why getting a dedicated hardware is much preferable than relying on a router. Or just buy the high end ones which undoubtedly can handle such torrent download speed on your connection since those router are ARM based dual-quad core, the only disadvantage with ARM there is only few router that is fully supported, even r7000 or equivalent routers is partially supported due to wireless radio is not supported due to missing drivers and the binary blob driver available at broadcom is for v2.6 kernel only.</p><p>anyway, just get your self a cheap raspberry pi, even the last last generation will do, since those pi&#039;s can handle download speed at 3MB/s (yep, megabyte) on p2p download or around 7MB/s on http/https downloads. You can also run away with pogoplug that supports arch linux (or OpenWRT, but the installation process is too hassle to begin with and requires JTAG access).</p>									</div>
