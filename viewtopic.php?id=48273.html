					<p>I just bought a used TP-LINK TL-WDR3600 locally. It already has been flashed with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1). The router is up and running. I&#039;ve have several devices, both wired and wireless connecting to the internet just fine.</p><p>I want to change the WAN DNS to 8.8.8.8 &amp; 8.8.4.4. A Google search mentioned editing /etc/config/network. So I tried to fire up a telnet session, but it says connection refused. I can ping 192.168.1.1 just fine from a terminal session. But telnet 192.168.1.1 returns the following error:</p><p>Connection refused<br />telnet: Unable to connect to remote host</p><p>I am running a Mac w/ OS X 10.9.1. The connection is over through a direct ethernet connection.</p><p>Interestingly, I&#039;ve already run OpenWrt x86 on VMWare and had no problem with telnet or LuCI.</p><p>Hope I don&#039;t have to re-flash the firmware. The previous owner has already done that.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>

					<p>You probably have set a password for the router this disables telnet access.</p><p>To connect to the router cli, you have to use ssh. since you are on a mac. <br />just open up the terminal and type: <em>ssh root@192.168.1.1</em> and hit enter</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 7 Jan 2014, 20:51)</p>

					<p>Additionally, you don&#039;t need to edit network settings via the console if you have LuCI on the machine. Go to Network, &quot;Edit&quot; on the WAN interface, Advanced Settings, uncheck &quot;Use DNS servers advertised by peer&quot; and fill in your own DNS servers right below.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow! Now that is a quick reply!</p><p>FriedZombie: Yes I figured out the ssh root@192.168.1.1 solution for telnet.</p><p>metai: Thanks for the LuCI way to configure WAN DNS. I ALMOST had it correct manually editing /etc/config/network, but not quite.</p><p>Thanks again! Sure I&#039;ll have more questions forthcoming...</p><p>Steve</p>									</div>
