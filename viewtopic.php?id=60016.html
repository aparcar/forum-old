					<p>Wow, this is frustrating.&nbsp; I have found it mentioned twice that you CAN flash it from DD-WRT to OpenWRT using the console but no mention of specifically what you need to do for that to work.</p><p><a href="http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=61772.0">http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=61772.0</a></p><p>I&#039;m assuming there is a header on the image that would need trimming or something....</p><p>Also, supposedly 2.4Ghz WiFi works on Chaos Calmer.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks allot for the image! I have no idea what security is being used on this thing! I tried your image and still get same result?? I was able to get it to flash a dd-wrt image, but ONLY USING Serial Port! That was a couple months ago. I cannot even upgrade to a different distro. I can stay within ddwrt, but not Open-WRT or LEDE.<br />**FYI Anyone wanting to use these things... MUST Upgrade VIA SERIAL** I may try to ssh in and &quot;burn&quot; an image that way Every attempt says successful, but upon reboot shows a default &quot;factory/ or ddwrt&quot; image. If all else fails I will break out the cables and take it back apart and burn something worth having. I dont really like dd-wrt or that community. I am truly stressed out trying to setup a client on a dual band mediatek with dd-wrt!</p><p>My unit is a A1 revision, just in case it matters.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>unimatrix725</strong> on 13 Mar 2017, 23:15)</p>
