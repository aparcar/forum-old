					<p>I have been tinkering with my new wrt54GSv3.&nbsp; I was curous how far the new processor would overclock, so I built a jtag, and flashed a custom CFE with reset_gpio=6 and boot_wait=on.&nbsp; </p><p>It seems that when I enter an invalid CPU speed, the processor automatically reverts to the last known good speed.&nbsp; This could be a very handy feature for overclocking, as there is a good chance we will not mess up as easily and need a jtag for recovery.</p><p>So far, I have it up to 250Mhz, cant seem to find a number that makes the cpu run higher than that.&nbsp; Makes me wonder if somehow it is locked to less than 250 mhz...</p><br /><p>Almost forgot: Dont take my word for it, if you mess up your router, its not my fault!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netprince</strong> on 30 Aug 2005, 19:08)</p>
