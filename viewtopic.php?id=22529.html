					<p>i am using my router to connect to a pptp server. I use the persist option so that the router reconnects when the link is down. However, during times when my internet connection is down, numerous &quot;sh -c pptp ****** --nolaunchpppd&quot; processes are spawned as the router redials. Is this normal behavior or did i set something wrong? This behaviour eventually leads to my router freezing if the internet connection goes down for a while.</p>									</div>
