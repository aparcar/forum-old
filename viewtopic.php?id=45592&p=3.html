					<p>Somewhat related, if only a pointer: In the last few days, I have been working on &quot;liberating&quot; a system also using the APM82181 SoC, albeit a very different one: The <a href="http://www.wdc.com/de/products/products.aspx?id=280">Western Digital My Book Live</a> uses the exact same SoC. It is running Debian out of the box, highly (pre-/mis-)configured by WD, but obviously very hackable. Also, its NAND (only 512k) contains a U-Boot that is searching configuration and booting Linux from the attached hard disk. There exist <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mbl-common/source/browse/kernel_2.6.32-61/">kernel patches for 2.6.32 (up to .61)</a>, main development is apparantly by a Russian named <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mbl-common/">Alex Rhyzov</a>, so most of the documentation is in Russian language (which Google Translate struggles with quite a bit).</p><p>Maybe both machines, the NAS and the router, can profit from Alex&#039; development and it can be ported over into OpenWrt development? It would certainly help the platform in general, as it seems the APM82181 target has been somewhat abandoned after kernel 2.6.32 (newer kernels would work, too, but apparantly lack DMA and have buggy SATA implementation).</p><p>(Also, My Book Live enclosures come dirt cheap at the moment. I recently got two empty enclosures for €10 each to do experiments on. They take pretty much any hard disk, as long as you manage to perform the <a href="http://community.wd.com/t5/My-Book-Live/GUIDE-How-to-unbrick-a-totally-dead-MBL/m-p/435724">&quot;debricking&quot; method</a> on them -- effectively ironing a factory firmware on an empty disk. My personal goal is to construct a &quot;free&quot;, standardized firmware on this &quot;makeshift&quot; NAS and take it over on my MBL machines that have been running on WD&#039;s firmware for years.)</p><p>Edit: It&#039;s quite hard to follow the development on the Russian forums, but there seems to be active developments. Another russian developer who goes by the name of &quot;Night_Ghost&quot; apparantly has been successfully <a href="http://www.ykoctpa.ru/groups/prival/kompyutery-i-programmy/wd-mbl/files/1387/">patching Kernel 3.2.64</a>. I have yet to try this one out, though, mainly because cross-compiling is a bit of a hassle at the moment due to Debian not offering a cross-build environment at the moment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 19 Dec 2014, 21:11)</p>

					<p>Any news on this? I managed to build the netgear image on a VM, but right now am struggling a bit trying to understand the build environment, in particular how to add dropbear as it seems to be missing and &quot;feeds/scripts search dropbear&quot; returns empty.<br />I&#039;d like first to get a ssh and a owncloud server running there, and then start working to resizing existing hd partitions and adding a swap and a ext4fs to run the system from. I might even resize/create the partitions externally, but mine has some hardware issues, installing the disk means dismantling the whole box, so I want to see if I can do all &quot;natively&quot;.<br />Any ideas/ pointers?</p>									</div>
