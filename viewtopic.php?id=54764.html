					<p>I think you don&#039;t get what i mean, I want to connect to a different host, not my router&#039;s host. I want to connect it from my openwrt.

					<p>If you are being immediately logged out, the issue is likely on the remote end, not yours.</p><p>There is no web GUI (or is one possible) - by definition, ssh is a command-line tool.&nbsp; As indicated before, you can certainly set up a public key relationship to prevent being asked the password, making it a &quot;one-line&quot; connection.</p><p>Your question isn&#039;t really OpenWRT specific and is more of a &quot;how do I use command-line SSH?&quot;, which may be better suited for a more appropriate forum, BTW.</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>
