					<p>@liladude.&nbsp; Not trying to totally discourage you on OpenVPN.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; Just trying to set realistic expectations.&nbsp; If you can be happy with 3-5, which I find is more than most hotels and airports, then doi it.&nbsp; You can always parlay your experience, and openvpn, network and firewall config to another device.</p><p>Regarding NTFS and automount.&nbsp; If one FS automounts, they all should.&nbsp; I spent a fair amount of time on NTFS and based upon what others report (real poor performance) abandon it and use FAT32 and EXT4.&nbsp; Also, I only get something around 10 for USB transfer speeds, so I find I load media from the PC as it so much faster.</p><p>Please talk more about what you are doing with minidlna.</p>									</div>

Having a NAS was the main goal of my purchase, so I guess everything extra is ok.<br />As a side note, block info will never see my ntfs, but blkid has no problem at all in recognizing all the detail... I guess this is related to the coice of removing ntfs support from the new block mount + fstab system, it took me a while to realize that ALL the post and tutorials around are for the old hotplug and not for the new one... Yes, Italy sucks with free hotspots, I could use them at University but they are not really free, you need to login with university credentials to access them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I have a question for people more involved in power sources. Do you think I need a minimum amp to have the external USB powered disk working attached to my hootoo? I have few chargers with the right usb I can use for powering the unit, but their amperage is quite low, like 180 or 500 mA at the best. Right now it&#039;s working with&nbsp; a battery pack that has 1000 mA output. (voltage is of course always 5V)</p>									</div>

Having a NAS was the main goal of my purchase, so I guess everything extra is ok.<br />As a side note, block info will never see my ntfs, but blkid has no problem at all in recognizing all the detail... I guess this is related to the coice of removing ntfs support from the new block mount + fstab system, it took me a while to realize that ALL the post and tutorials around are for the old hotplug and not for the new one... Yes, Italy sucks with free hotspots, I could use them at University but they are not really free, you need to login with university credentials to access them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I have a question for people more involved in power sources. Do you think I need a minimum amp to have the external USB powered disk working attached to my hootoo? I have few chargers with the right usb I can use for powering the unit, but their amperage is quite low, like 180 or 500 mA at the best. Right now it&#039;s working with&nbsp; a battery pack that has 1000 mA output.

If you use a flash drive instead, then the 1 amp supply will be enough.<br />I had my WD 1 TB 2.5 inch SATA II Drive connected to the TM02 with the USB to SATA adapter and hard drive, and my iPad 2 charger powering it all...and it worked very well.<br />This was with the stock factory HooToo firmware... I&#039;m hoping to get the file server working as well with the OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05 too. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all, I am reporting for my minidlna and external ntfs usb 1TB disk.<br />After checking info about the matter I decided it was easier to restart the minidlna from shell and see the error(s) right away... well, after issuing /etc/init.d/minidlna stop and start I only got a complain about two directories in my config file he could not access (they are on other disks I was trying to test) and suddenly the catalogue started to build.<br />Not sure if this is because I am on another disk, I will check later and compare.<br />I set the catalogue and logs inside the main disk, if I am not mistaken this will avoid the catalogue being wiped from temp each time I disconnect the TM02. Now I have both samba and minidlna and hopefully I will put everything at work soon!</p><p>edit: <br />I can access the minidlna from my smartphone just fine, but in windows 8 I see it as a resource and not as a multimedia server... It worked before so I must have screwed something ... not that I need to have the server working for my pc, but it&#039;s a matter of configuring properly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liladude</strong> on 26 Mar 2016, 10:13)</p>

					<p>Not sure if I should keen updating my previous post or if I can add a new one even if no other post was added after mine, I&#039;m reporting again about minidnla. Wiki page is a bit silent on the matter, but upon further search on the wild web I discovered that minidlna on openwrt is lacking several standard command, like the -R option to get the files.db rebuilt.<br />The only way to rebuild it is to stop the service, delete or move&nbsp; the file and start the service again. Inotify seems completely useless, so I disabled it.<br />Since it took my device about 45 minutes to rebuild the db of a bit more than 800 mp4 files I thought it could be lovely to perform a cron job that does it during the night or early in the morning.<br />My plan is to write this script</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#! bin/sh

If you you use the method described in the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna#chaos_calmer_tips">Wiki</a>, you can create an miniudlna database of over 11,000 media files on a laptop/PC within a matter of minutes which the HooToo can then read. The HooToo can not create a database that size since it will run out of RAM and be constantly swapping to disk if you have <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/fstab#adding_swap_partitions">swap</a> enabled.</p><p>If you must use Windows, you can install <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> and try the minidlna port <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/minidlna/patches/33/?limit=25&amp;page=1#956f">here</a>..</p><p>Good Luck!</p>									</div>

Using uboot and your TFTP server, reprogram the &quot;u-boot&quot; partition with &quot;Bootloader.bin&quot;<br />4. Reboot into the original factory uboot and using that program the &quot;ALL&quot; partition with &quot;ALL.bin&quot;.<br />5. Reboot - you are done</p><p>BTW, it can also be done from the ash command line but it&#039;s a bit more complicated. In short you&#039;d need to do this:</p><p>1. Shutdown the squashFS and run out of a ramdisk<br />2. Using mtd write &quot;Bootloader.bin&quot; to the u-boot MTD partition<br />3. Concantenate Kernel_RootFS.bin + params.bin + user_backup.bin + user.bin + Rootfs.bin into one file using cat<br />4. Useing mtd write that file to the firmware MTD partition<br />5. Reboot</p><p>Ideally, someone could write a short script to do the above but my time is tight and I don&#039;t have time to write it or test it at the moment. I strongly recommend that if one just wants to experiment with OpenWRT that they use a platform that can easily be switched back and forth like RPi or beagle black (I prefer the latter).</p><p>Hope this helps</p></blockquote></div><p>I would like to revert back to factory image, do I need to solder connections inside to use serial console or can I console to it via the ethernet port?</p>									</div>
