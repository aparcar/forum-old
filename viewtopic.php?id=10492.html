					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am not a experienced network engineer, I need your help very urgently - I have been trying to fix this for at least 8 weeks.</p><p>I use a OpenWRT powered AP with WPA-PSK encryption which acts as a bridge between wired and wireless interfaces. Its clients are a secound AP using wpa_supplicant and and notebook. The DHCP server is a ActiveDirectory controller in the wired environment - all other DHCP servers are disabled. Firewall and NAT are also disabled.</p><p>When I connect to the AP using the notebook, everything is working fine including DHCP autoconfiguration. But when I connect using the client AP it works only for the first time, as soon as the client AP disconnects DHCP is not working anymore. </p><p>This is a tcpdump of the wireless interface on the client AP:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>00:43:33.393131 IP 0.0.0.0.68 &gt; 255.255.255.255.67: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:18:0a:01:1b:09 (oui Unknown), length: 277

					<p>Based on your description you are running into one of the problems with bridged client-mode wireless.&nbsp; 802.11 packet headers do not contain the source mac address, which causes trouble when you attempt to hide multiple computers behind a single wireless card.&nbsp; This is why bridged client-mode is considered a horrible hack, it tends to cause issues like the ones you describe.&nbsp; The proper way to configure this network is to enable WDS on both routers.&nbsp; WDS adds the missing fourth header in 802.11 packets, allowing your network to properly function with several machines connecting to the second router.&nbsp; It also has the added benefit of allowing you to connect wirelessly to the second router (in addition to the wired connections.)</p>									</div>

					<p>You can also set up routing, but if you want a single DHCP server, that&#039;s not an option.</p><p>You might be able to do some nifty tricks with a dhcp relay and get that to work, though.&nbsp; Hmnm.... &quot;option 82&quot; seems to also be useful.&nbsp; I think you can use that to tell the dhcp server which subnet the request is from.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>exobyte</strong> on 25 Apr 2007, 22:47)</p>
