					<p>I don&#039;t have a solid answer for you, but I can say the following for certain:</p><p>1. Routing packets between networks would never by itself cause SMB to break<br />2. A firewall that mangles packets can definitely cause stuff to break if it starts altering the packets on their way through.<br />3. Interface problems can definitely cause stuff to break.</p><p>Given that, if it works on the same LAN (via a switch) and breaks via the router, it&#039;s either something IPTables is doing to the packets, or more realistically interface duplex issues on one or both devices when traversing the router.&nbsp; Duplex issues can and WILL ruin packets and corrupt them utterly, causing lots of retransmits and eventually dropped connections.&nbsp; You will find that small transfers work, and other low-bandwidth stuff works.&nbsp; Anything that causes link saturation will die.&nbsp; Perhaps run ifconfig under Linux to check for errors/collisions/etc.</p><p>I would say it&#039;s more likely interface problems than IPTables problems.&nbsp; With your routed configuration, ask yourself the following questions:</p><p>What are the computers connected to, and are those devices switches with autonegotiation or hubs?<br />Are you forcing full/half duplex on any of the computers?<br />Are you using NICs with DEC21140 chipsets (known to be awful at link negotiation)?</p><br /><p>Kaldek</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaldek</strong> on 22 Sep 2005, 04:03)</p>

					<p>Hmm, I&#039;ve just realised that running ifconfig under Linux won&#039;t tell you anything because all of the interfaces on the router are connected directly to its switch.&nbsp; The only errors you would see would be between the Broadcom ethernet hardware and the switch hardware (which is on the same motherboard!).</p><p>It could still be interface problems though - on your servers of course, so you&#039;d need to check for the errors on them.&nbsp; I really can&#039;t remember how to do that in Windows though!</p><p>Kaldek</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaldek</strong> on 24 Sep 2005, 03:24)</p>
