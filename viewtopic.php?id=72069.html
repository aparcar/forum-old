					<p>Since my router TPLINK WR841ND v8 apparently is bricked as per the disscusion had in here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=72064">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=72064</a> and my LAN1 port is not working to try the debricking process without serial, I think my last option is to try to debrick it using the serial port.</p><p>As I don&#039;t have the appropriate cable right now but I do have an extra router (WR741ND v4.21), I was thinking to follow the steps described in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial#use_another_openwrt_router_as_a_console">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/p â€¦ _a_console</a> to get access to the malfunctioning router through the router that&#039;s working OK. Once connected, I would try to debrick it with the steps described in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#v7">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#v7</a> for v7, since for v8 is available only without serial cable.</p><p>So I will connect the routers between them through serial port, and then I will connect my PC to the working router through RJ45. Then I will execute all the commands from a telnet window from my PC:</p><p>Could anybody tell me if that is feasible to do and that there is no risk to damage the working router?<br />How should I connect the routers through the serial port? RX with RX, TX with TX or RX with TX and TX with RX? Should the other pins connected as well?<br />Are the instructions described in <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#v7">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#v7</a> suitable for v8 as well?</p><p>Thanks for any help you could give me. I will really appreciate it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Jwaynw</strong> on 15 Sep 2017, 06:41)</p>

					<p>Do yourself a favour, get the proper ttl level usb serial cable, it saves you a lot of trouble. Keep in mind that your working router uses its very own serial port for its console messages - thereby causing quite some problems for the broken device (and freeing ttys0 up completely, bootloader, kernel and userspace needs quite some additional effort and breakage potential); this would be a different case if one of the devices at your disposal (e.g. a SBC) would offer a usb port which doesn&#039;t double up as console.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 15 Sep 2017, 10:04)</p>
