					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I have installed the gw6c (with ssl support from <a href="http://wiki.andy.id.au/Home/openwrt/gw6c-ssl)">http://wiki.andy.id.au/Home/openwrt/gw6c-ssl)</a>,<br />because the offical one has no ssl.<br />It works well, however, I cannot reboot the router if I have started the gw6c, even not firstly start then stop it manually.<br />At the other hand, if I disable it, not let it start, I can reboot normally. because I have no way to see the syslog after I type reboot, so cannot figure out why</p><p>My router is brcm2.4 based, Openwrt is 8.09.1.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Which router are you using?</p><p>I haven&#039;t had this issue with my WRT54GL that uses this package.&nbsp; Can you check if you have enough space on your JFFS filesystem to install all the packages?</p><p>You could try my complete firmware which is at <a href="http://wiki.andy.id.au/Home/openwrt/custom-builds">http://wiki.andy.id.au/Home/openwrt/custom-builds</a> (you will need a router with at least 4MB flash).</p>									</div>
