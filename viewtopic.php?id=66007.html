					<p>New to the OpenWrt forum<br />I&#039;m trying to develop a wifi IP camera using the RT5350 or MT7620 chip and a USB camera, using mjpg-streamer.<br />I need to have a 10 second boot time (from power on to streaming video). I&#039;ve been researching what affect the boot time. What item should I look to streamline and customize? What slows down the boot process?<br />I know I need to remove any unused packages. <br />What are the minimum packages I need besides usb-core, usb-uvc, mjpg-streamer?<br />Do I need to customize uboot?<br />Will making the device a client vs an AP reduce the packages/services needed?<br />I know I&#039;m asking for a lot. I&#039;d just like suggestions into what I should research and look into.<br />Any suggestions will be appreciated. <br />Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jalex403</strong> on 5 Jul 2016, 21:52)</p>
