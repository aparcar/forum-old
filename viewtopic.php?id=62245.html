					<p>My setup is as follows :</p><p>LAN network ---- OPENWRT ----- WAN DSL ROUTER ------ INTERNET</p><p>I have installed upnpc on OPENWRT device and enabled UPNP on WAN DSL Router.</p><p>This is the output I get for the command.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# upnpc -m wlan0 -l

No IGD UPnP Device found on the network !</code></pre></div><p>So I go to LUCI - Network - Firewall - Traffic Rules and create a new rule as leased as possible<br />From WAN (all options are &#039;any&#039;) to Device (again all options &#039;any&#039;) </p><p>So now the output for iptables is </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Chain delegate_input (1 references)

List of UPNP devices found on the network :

No valid UPNP Internet Gateway Device found.</code></pre></div><p>Which indicates it does find the WAN router but still it cant get the mappings, nor can I add or delete any mapping.</p><p>So what have I done wrong ?</p><p>If I connect my Linux Laptop directly to the WAN router and issue UPNPC , I get all mappings and everything works normally, So the WAN router configuration seems fine.</p><p>There is no firewall enabled in the WAN router and I have also tried to change different WAN Ips for the Openwrt router also. I have even tried it giving the IP of my Linux Laptop but also at vain.</p><p>I am pretty pretty sure I have done it in the past, but after I reset the Openwrt I forgot what I had earlier done.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
