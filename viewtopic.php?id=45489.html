					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have dnsmasq running for a private and a public LAN.<br />That way my&nbsp; router is a DNS server for both networks.</p><p>But DNS queries from the public LAN should not be resolved<br />using the routers internet connection, but should be send to a<br />different DNS server in public LAN.</p><p>Or maybe dnsmasqs DNS server can be limited to just one<br />network (do I need iptables here?).</p><p>thanks,<br />mwarning</p>									</div>

					<p>so you&#039;re trying to get your public lan to not resolve using your wan DNS, and instead use a different server, but still have your private lan network use the wan dns ?</p><p>Sounds like dhcp option 6 is what you&#039;re looking for.</p><p>Ex.</p><br /><p>config dhcp &#039;guest&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;guest&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;start&#039; &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;limit&#039; &#039;200&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option leasetime &#039;12h&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list &#039;dhcp_option&#039; &#039;1,255.255.255.255&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list &#039;dhcp_option&#039; &#039;6,208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220&#039;</p><br /><p>What this does is push a specific DNS server directly to your clients via dhcp.&nbsp; So you could only have this option on your public lan, and your private lan would still get served the default setup.</p>									</div>
