					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m really new to this forum, so I hope it&#039;s the right place to post this...</p><p>I&#039;m currently developing a software that I&#039;ll sell to dentists, and it uses a Toshiba FlashAir SD-Card to take pictures and transfer them wirelessly to a computer.<br />To do that, the SD-Card must connect to an access point, and that&#039;s why currently, I&#039;m using the TP-Link nano router that is connected to my computer via a USB/Ethernet adapter.</p><p>So the TP-Link nano router diffuse a SSID &quot;A&quot;, and the SD card connects to &quot;A&quot; automatically.<br />And the computer is connected to the router via the USB/Ethernet adapter, so now the computer can reach the SD Card because they&#039;re on the same network.</p><p>Everything is working great and all, but I&#039;m searching for a small router that can do all that, by using the USB port to power it and also to act as a USB/Ethernet adapter.<br />I found one... the ASUS WL-330NUL, but it&#039;s not supported on Windows 10 or OSX 10.11...</p><p>And I&#039;ve searched for hours, days and days, and found nothing else...</p><p>I have absolutely no issue to pay someone who can guide me and help me with this process.</p><p>So my questions are:<br />- Do you guys know any device that can do that?<br />- The source code for the ASUS WL-330NUL is available. Is it &quot;easy&quot; and possible to add support for Windows 10 and OSX 10.11?<br />- Is it possible to create a device from scratch that can do what I want?</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance for your answers...</p><p>Have a great day <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
