					<p>Hi all,<br />Working with TP-Link&#039;s atm and finding I&#039;m in need of yet another bit of gear.. a flash programmer.<br />Immediate application is for working with SPI&#039;s found on common soho SoC router platforms we all love <br />However I&#039;ve had plenty of times where I could have used a &#039;universal&#039; flasher for other breeds of SPI flash, traditional EEPROMs and also want to get into AVR/PIC&#039;-type micro&#039;s. </p><p>If there&#039;s a cheap, well-supported programmer which only supports the SPI&#039;s found in routers, esp with WRT-oriented software support, I&#039;ll just go for that.</p><p>But if there&#039;s a more &#039;universal&#039; programmer that can handle uC&#039;s, eEPROM&#039;s as well, and if the software side of things is the same, I&#039;d be keen to make an investment there.</p><p>Key points are </p><p>-low cost, good availability<br />-USB<br />-wide compatibility and frequent updates if req&#039;d,<br />-good software support, <br />-community familiarity/support,<br />-and if I understand things right, in-place read/write and/or tracing/capture as nice-to-have instead of BusPirate etc.</p><p>I&#039;ve done some crawling but there&#039;s no real leads on what would suit, as with JTAG where things are clearer.</p><p>Thanks all<br />Ben</p>									</div>

Good support, frequent updates - new software and more IC support. It can program more than 12700+ chips etc. but no community support sorry it&#039;s proprietary: <a href="http://www.autoelectric.cn/minipro/">link</a>. It&#039;s a little bit slow for my test sometimes but never failed me once. Auto-detection of Flash chips is on very nice function...<br />Software is in English/Chinese. There are other companies as well that produce universal programmers with this chip.<br />You can find it on ebay one example <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/TL866A-High-Speed-USB-Minipro-Programmer-AVR-PIC-Bios-51-MCU-Flash-Newest-/221262728145?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3384494bd1">full set</a>, you can find it a lot more cheaper without all &quot;bells and whistle&quot;... </p><p>I&#039;d always wanted to try out <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate">BusPirate</a>. But have not yet done so can&#039;t say anything about it, but it looks like nice tool - but certainly will require more &quot;work&quot; than a universal programmer to get the job done, but also will be as well more flexible!</p><p>So good luck with the choice!</p>									</div>
