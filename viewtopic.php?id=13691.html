					<p>I&#039;m trying to get my head around iptables (kamikaze 7.09 on WL-500gP), and am currently stuck at $subj.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to find anything useful on this, as you usually need to forward a port to a LAN address, so each and every topic and tutorial I found was on this matter, and the minor differences to make it work for external addresses seem to elude me. What I&#039;d like to do, for example, is the equivalent of<br />nc -p 8080 -L 64.233.167.99:80 (connecting to my router on port 8080 from *LAN or WAN would give me google.com page)<br />Any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nth</strong> on 9 Dec 2007, 12:37)</p>
