					<p>Hi,<br />im running openwrt on a ASUS WL-500G Deluxe and i&#039;m very happy with it. At the moment i&#039;m looking for a new router for my parents. The ASUS WL-500G Deluxe is not on sale anymore in germany.<br />I need a router with USB so the ASUS WL-500G Premium would be possible. But because of the different versions (V1 supported, V2 not yet supported) i don&#039;t know if i get the right device.</p><br /><p>Do you have any hints, where (and what) to buy?</p>									</div>

					<p>Would the V2 hardware (it appears the only even partially supported Asus hardware) be capable of being easily installed with a Kamikaze binary or, as this link suggests is a lot of fooling around necessary?</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GPV2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … /WL500GPV2</a></p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT (actually am using X-Wrt) and had to do enough fooling around just to get WhiteRussian to work on my WRT54GS including OpenVPN (my main impetus for tackling the project).</p><p>I don&#039;t suppose anyone has worked on getting WR running on the Asus V2, have they?</p><p>Also, wireless is pretty important to me, so is that going to work w/o hassle?</p><p>Ideally, I&#039;d be able to find some hardware that&#039;s close enough to the earlier version Linksys WRT54GSes that I&#039;d be able to run a straight WhiteRussian (since I&#039;m already familiar with that version) install from binary.&nbsp; It appears to me after lots of searching and referring to the Table of Hardware:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware</a></p><p>That there&#039;s not much out there that&#039;s fully supported (in binary) and currently available.&nbsp; Am I missing an obvious candidate that can easily be bought new?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tgice</strong> on 30 Jul 2008, 21:00)</p>
