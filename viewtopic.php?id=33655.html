					<p>Hi dudes,</p><p>I´m trying to create multiple wifi adapters, and I noticed iptables is not handling right when I have more than one virtual device.</p><p>For instance:</p><p>1) If I have only wlan0 adapter I can access internet normally on eth.0 (Client mode)<br />Iptables does NAT since wlan0 to eth.0 nicely.</p><p>2) When I create other virtual device wlan0-1 for (AP point)<br />Iptables can´t do NAT since wlan0-1 to eth.0, in this case loses all configuration for wlanX, not even wlan0 appears more.</p><p>Is there anyone able to tell what to do? </p><p>I´d like to inform iptables to use wlan0-1 to do NAT to eth.0<br />Because wlan0 turns into AP Point, and wlan0-1 turns into Client Mode and in this one I can get Internet.</p><p>Let me know.</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p><p>Regards,</p>									</div>
