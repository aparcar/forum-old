					<p>Hello, </p><p>While configuring my firewall and QOS, I wanted to make use of the ipp2p module.

					<p>I didn&#039;t build an .ipk, because I spent over an hour getting a build environment setup, following these instructions to get the modules built:</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1866">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1866</a></p><p>and getting everything working, but I&#039;ve put up the two modules you need for WhiteRussion RC3. (in addition to the iptables-extra, and tc packages) here if anyone wants to use them:</p><p><a href="http://blues.gotdns.org/ipt_classify.tar.bz">http://blues.gotdns.org/ipt_classify.tar.bz</a></p><p>on your WRT:</p><p>Copy ipt_CLASSIFY.o to /lib/modules/2.4.30/<br />Copy libipt_CLASSIFY.so to /usr/lib/iptables/</p><p>make sure you&#039;ve got all your modules insmod&#039;d:</p><p>for module in sch_prio sch_htb sch_sfq sch_ingress cls_tcindex cls_fw cls_route cls_u32 ipt_CLASSIFY ipt_length<br />do<br />&nbsp; insmod $module 2&gt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null<br />done</p><p>and away you go.&nbsp; </p><p>For anyone else (besides wtrenker reading this), if you&#039;re new to traffic shaping read this:</p><p><a href="http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.cookbook.fullnat.intro.html">http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.cookbook.f … intro.html</a></p><p>Make sure you understand what&#039;s going on, then look at this example to see another way of doing it:</p><p><a href="http://brewer123.home.comcast.net/openwrt/S46qos">http://brewer123.home.comcast.net/openwrt/S46qos</a></p><p>and finally, look at this for what I think is the most elegant way, thus the reason I wanted the classify module (combined with some of the best bits from the other two):</p><p><a href="http://www.knowplace.org/shaper/examples.html">http://www.knowplace.org/shaper/examples.html</a></p><p>For the weak at heart, don&#039;t attempt any of this. Just get the wondershaper package and start learning from there.&nbsp; When you&#039;re feet are wet and you&#039;re comfortable, then have it.</p><p>Someone with more time could easily turn this into an .ipk if they want to, and personally, I&#039;d really like to see the classify module included in the iptables-extra package, because it&#039;s much cleaner than using tc alone (not human readable), or having to go through multiple steps of marking packets with iptables (inefficient).</p><br /><p>Greg</p>									</div>

					<p>You&#039;re welcome, hope it helps.&nbsp; I got interested in traffic shaping when I started playing with asterisk and VOIP, so I know exactly what you mean.&nbsp; If you want to see what my setup looks like, I put it up as well:</p><p><a href="http://blues.gotdns.org/traffic-shaping.tar.bz">http://blues.gotdns.org/traffic-shaping.tar.bz</a></p><p>These files are installed as follows:<br />75-ts -&gt; /etc/modules.d/&nbsp; (loads all the proper modules on bootup.&nbsp; I like the way OpenWrt&nbsp; does this; very clean!)<br />traffic-shaper.conf -&gt; /etc&nbsp; (configures your bandwidth settings, and your percentages for the different classes)<br />S61traffic-shaping -&gt; /etc/init.d&nbsp; (sets up the classes, categorizes with iptables classify, starts, stops, restart, status, etc.)&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve commented these so it should be pretty easy to see what&#039;s going on... at least it is for me :-)</p><p>I shamlessly stole and modified the init.d script from <a href="http://www.knowplace.org/shaper/examples.html">http://www.knowplace.org/shaper/examples.html</a></p><p>What you need installed:<br />You&#039;ll need the classify modules I posted earlier.<br />You&#039;ll need bc (available via the tracker) to do some calculations.<br />In addition you need all the normal stuff for traffic shaping that can be found via the tracker (tc, iptables-extra, kmod-iptables-extra)</p><p>This is my first serious effort at traffic shaping, and I&#039;ve done a lot of research, but there&#039;s certainly a chance I screwed something up.&nbsp; Let me know if you see any glaring errors.&nbsp; </p><p>FYI - I picked my own numbers (S61 and 75) for these files, and they don&#039;t have any official blessing, so it&#039;s possible that someone official (such as nbd) could make a change that conflicts with these.&nbsp; Use at your own risk; YMMV; works for me. :-)</p><p>Future plans:<br />1)&nbsp; I don&#039;t do any ingress throttling, primarily because TCP should do that for me based on my egress rates, which I&#039;m controlling.&nbsp; I may add it later though just to play around a bit...<br />2)&nbsp; I may add some lines to set ToS on certain traffic.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do that now for two reasons.&nbsp; First, asterisk already sets ToS on it&#039;s own traffic via its config, and second, it&#039;s extremely unlikely that all the hops along the way really obey ToS anyway.&nbsp; However I may do some ToS over VPN tunnels where I have more control (ToS encapsulated in the payload) so the endpoints could get it and repect the setting.</p><br /><p>Let me know what you think or if you&#039;ve got something better!</p><br /><p>Greg</p>									</div>

					<p>Patrik, did you look at the documentation links I referenced, or the files I posted, because what you&#039;re doing seems much more complicated than it needs to be.</p><p>I prefer iptables with the classify module because IMHO it&#039;s much cleaner, and by that I mean more efficient and human readable.&nbsp; The link you posted is very difficult to clearly see what&#039;s going on.</p><p>Second, my script and modules fit very nicely into the stock OpenWrt setup, and could easily be an add-on ipkg.&nbsp; Thanks to the elegant way that OpenWrt is structured, my files fit in very nicely and require no modifications to anything.&nbsp; I purposely separated them from the firewall.user file so that I could turn traffic shaping on and off with affecting the rest of my NAT and firewall stuff.&nbsp; Your link, on the other hand, looks like a massive depature from the stock setup.&nbsp; </p><p>If you combine my bits with the already available p2p package, it seems like you&#039;ll have the same thing as what you posted, with much less of a headache when you&#039;re done.</p><p>Anyway I really hope no traffic shaping stuff gets included in the mainline image, but rather stays as an optional package.&nbsp; The real beauty (and the secret to the success) of OpenWrt is the very nicely organized, minimal image that easy to customize the way you want it!&nbsp; So your device can be an access point, or a radius server, or a web server, or a router, all with same base image, and a minimal amount of effort.</p><p>Thanks developers!</p><p>G</p>									</div>

					<p>For anyone who&#039;s interested, I updated my traffic shaping script to fix some problems I noticed.&nbsp; &nbsp;The biggest problem was that I didn&#039;t notice that sshd generates all of its outbound traffic as ToS type 16 (minimize-delay) and my script was honoring ToS before doing anything else, so all the ssh traffic was getting a much higher priority that it was supposed to, and my later rules for ssh were being ignored.&nbsp; Ooops.&nbsp; That&#039;ll teach me to write a script and not sniff the wire to see what was happening...</p><p>Since there doesn&#039;t seem to be any configuration option to change the way sshd marks its packets, I&#039;ve resorted to modifying the ToS bits on the ssh packets before classifying them.&nbsp; Kind of a shame to have to mangle the same packet twice, but my WRT can handle it.&nbsp; You&#039;ll notice I&#039;m doing it inbound on the br0 interface which means that even internal ssh traffic is getting mangled.&nbsp; This certainly isn&#039;t neccesary as I could just do it on the POSTROUTING chain on vlan1 prior to my other rules, but I prefer to keep it that way for no particular reason.&nbsp; Probably lack of coffee. :-)</p><p>So my primary changes are:<br />* [bug] - Fixed how I handled ssh traffic to properly give interactive traffic higher priority than bulk traffic<br />* [feature] - Switched udp to highest priority for SIP and games<br />* [bug] - Included an /etc/services file so the script will actually work</p><p>The last bit is optional, and is only for convenience.&nbsp; If you have the space on your device, you can add the services file so you can use text descriptions of ports in the script like I do, but the file is rather large.&nbsp; Those short on space should not use the file, and instead change the text to actual port numbers.&nbsp; I have a GS so I&#039;ve got room. :-)</p><p>To recap my last few notes...</p><p>I&#039;ve put the new version here:</p><p><a href="http://blues.gotdns.org/traffic-shaping-1.3.tar.bz">http://blues.gotdns.org/traffic-shaping-1.3.tar.bz</a></p><p>and the classify modules for WR-RC3 are still here:</p><p><a href="http://blues.gotdns.org/ipt_classify.tar.bz">http://blues.gotdns.org/ipt_classify.tar.bz</a></p><p>The files are as follows:</p><p>services -&gt; /etc (standard services file taken from Fedora Core 3, allows text descriptions of ports in script)<br />75-ts -&gt; /etc/modules.d/&nbsp; (loads all the proper modules on bootup.&nbsp; I like the way OpenWrt&nbsp; does this; very clean!)<br />traffic-shaper.conf -&gt; /etc&nbsp; (configures your bandwidth settings, and your percentages for the different classes)<br />S61traffic-shaping -&gt; /etc/init.d&nbsp; (sets up the classes, categorizes with iptables classify, starts, stops, restart, status, etc.) <br />ipt_CLASSIFY.o -&gt; /lib/modules/2.4.30/ (kernel module for classifying packets)<br />libipt_CLASSIFY.so -&gt; /usr/lib/iptables/ (iptables interface to kernel module)</p><p>What you need installed:<br />You&#039;ll need the classify modules.<br />You&#039;ll need bc (available via the tracker) to do some calculations.<br />You need all the normal stuff for traffic shaping that can be found via the tracker (tc, iptables-extra, kmod-iptables-extra)</p><p>-----------</p><p>So the result is that I&#039;ve written and customized this to shape my traffic that I see on my network, but it should be a really useful starting point for anyone looking to do the same on the their network.&nbsp; I just think it&#039;s cleaner and more understandable than the various versions of wondershaper that are out there.&nbsp; It&#039;s at least a very good learning tool, if nothing else.</p><p>Maybe someone would like to help me make an ipkg of this?&nbsp; Anyone have any feedback or suggestions?</p><p>Greg</p>									</div>
