					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I have a Linksys WAG200G that I would like to get OpenWRT running on. </p><p>I have constructed a serial console cable, and successfully observed the boot sequence. For some strange reason I have not yet been able to influence the boot process though - it seems that the RX on the serial port is not working. It DOES work on a (broken) WAG54Gv2, though, if I adjust the pin layout appropriately, so I believe that the cable is fine.</p><p>The major problem that I am facing is that the bootloader (ADAM2) does not wait for a TFTP or FTP connection, but immediately proceeds to load the kernel. I&#039;m concerned that if I flash a non-working kernel, I won&#039;t be able to recover without JTAG. While I *DO* have a JTAG adapter, I haven&#039;t been able to get it to work yet.</p><p>So, my (longwinded) question is, has anyone been able to rebuild ADAM2 for the WAG200G? Or, is there a better bootloader (PSPBoot?) that I can use instead?</p>									</div>

					<p>There is a PSPBoot version for WAG200G. See RouterTech forums for it</p>									</div>
