					<p>Dear Scruffy,</p><p>wow, really interesting table concerning the web server on Open WRT.</p><p>Sincerely thanks.</p><p>But just two things or better three things in fact.</p><p>First of all I know you may be can answer all my requests but please let me tell you what I really want to do with my OpenWRT (on ASUS WL-500gP 1).</p><p>I though to use it like a small server. And when I read the Nginx seems to be a : &quot;high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server &quot; I just regret there is no wiki page explaining how to configure it perfectly (following what I want to do).</p><p>Then I will explain :<br />1) I installed my OpenWRT on my ASUS WL-500g Premium I (4 RJ45 and 2 USB). No problem until I have space problems and though to install the needed software on the connected USB HDD. I can getting it works. Even if I can install programs on the USB I don&#039;t know how to tell it to start them. I can&#039;t find the really well explained documentation.</p><p>2) I though to use it for those special things :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) install a web server (for my personal CMS use),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) install the owhttpd&nbsp; &nbsp;(for home temperature check),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) install a mail server that can receive autoforwarding mails and then tell me each hour if I received e-mail (to prevent always being before my display to check the mailboxes. Or to tell me it when I wake up or come back home.),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; d) and finally (by using the concerned web server) doing motion detection with the webcam connected on the second USB (or on an ethernet port).</p><p>Then by reading the fact Nginx seems to be a : &quot;high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server&quot; I presume it is the best web server I need to make my point a), c) and d).</p><p>Then I can consider that the needed documentation is needed for Nginx, OWHttpd, Motion (detection) software (installation and cnfiguration), and Speaking software to tell me (only if I receved one) from who I received e-mail. </p><p>With sincerely thanks with the work you already done for web server. Now when I will have time I will check the Nginx (LAMP) and other needed programs.</p><p>Have a nice day,</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>concerning my point 1) and 2) a) are made.</p><p>I well installed an external HDD and install programs on it (even the swap but I don&#039;t know if this swap works).<br />I well installed the web server nginx (2) a)). But I can&#039;t start it.</p><p>I created the symbolic link (number 61) in the rc.d to /mnt/sda3/OpenWRT-Pgms/etc/init.d/nginx. And in this nginx I changed the START to 61.<br />I rebooted and tried again to start it. Here is the error I received :<br />/mnt/sda3/OpenWRT-Pgms/etc/init.d/nginx start<br />/mnt/sda3/OpenWRT-Pgms/usr/sbin/nginx: can&#039;t load library &#039;libpcre.so.0&#039;</p><p>Then I installed the libpcre program also on the mounted external HDD and it doesn&#039;t find it.</p><p>And after having checked the list-installed programs I can see this libpcre is well known as installed.</p><p>Then, can somebody tell me how to solve this and get nginx working ?</p><p>Sincerely thanks and have a nice day.</p><p>Miguipda ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>@migupida do the &#039;$ free&#039; to find out if your swap works, and do not try to hijack another user post. Open your own new post with 1) 2) 3) ...</p><p>With regard to web servers table, it definitely needs to be reworked and filled with information relevant to the OpenWRT distribution. Web servers comparison table is needed, but it has to contain only the relevant information that will cause you to choose one web server over the other. Here are my suggestions:</p><p>1. Consolidate the 3 different &quot;SIZE&quot; columns into one.&nbsp; Having one number for base+dependencies, and skip the extensions since they are very small anyways.<br />2. Delete the description column all together. Instead have a column called &quot;LIMITATIONS&quot; that would highlight what one server can do that another cannot.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lighttpd - no support for .htaccess<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lighttpd - no error log per virtual host<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;apache - big memory hog<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;nginx - no project bug tracking system<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;uhttpd - limited to a single PHP process<br />3. Do not list the extensions each on one line. This makes the table look ridiculously long.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>
