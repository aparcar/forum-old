					<p>Hello,</p><p>i try to get my tp-link to function as a simple repeater due to an incredible signal blocking wall which drives me nuts;-)</p><p>So I followed a youtube as well as a text text tutorial but it seems like I have missed something because even though I can connect to the TP-Link/openwrt using wlan and the wlan connection between the two routers does also work, I cant use the Internet Connection throuh the tplink.</p><p>What did I miss?</p><p>Screenshot of connected Interfaces:<br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6kx2s3m818d3ld/openwrt_Int.PNG?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6kx2s3m818d3 … t.PNG?dl=0</a></p><p>Screenshot of Firewall settings:<br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g1hrzg1vd2yysfn/openwrt_FW.PNG?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/g1hrzg1vd2yys … W.PNG?dl=0</a></p><br /><p>Thank you:-)</p>									</div>
