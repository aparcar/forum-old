					<p>Hi</p><p>I flashed my Motorola WR850G with the latest snapshot of OpenWrt and ran into a problem. I think te flash completed succefully. I enabled boot wait so i was able to restart the router and send another firmware via TFTP. But none of them worked.</p><p>Finally i built a RS-232 to TTL serial cable for this and the console output is included below . Can someone point me in the right direction.</p><p>The final message seems to be &quot;debug, Sending discover...&quot; and then it just sits there. </p><p>Thanks</p><br /><br /><p>CFE version 1.0.37 for BCM947XX (32bit,SP,LE)&nbsp;

					<p>finally i got it fixed. I had to flash via the console using the flash -noheader option. </p><p>I used the firmware &quot;openwrt-generic-jffs2-4MB.trx&quot; </p><p>This seem to have solved the problem of getting the openwrt on to the router. Now all set to play with the new open source firmware. </p><p>Also how do i get back to the OEM firmware if i have to. When i try to load it using the same flash -noheader option, it flashes fine but at reboot it says &quot;Invalid boot block on disk&quot;. </p><p>thanks for all the efforts of the people on this forum.</p>									</div>

					<p>That makes sense.&nbsp; The boot time tftp expects an image with the header which openwrt-generic-jffs2-4MB.trx doesn&#039;t have.&nbsp; These no-header images can be flashed by &quot;mtd write openwrt-generic-jffs2-4MB.trx linux&quot;, etc.</p><p>The linksys stock firmwares and openwrt-*.bin images have the header that includes some model specific information, and these are meant to be used with the boot time tftp, the web interface/tftp in the stock firmware.&nbsp; It should also work if you don&#039;t specify the&nbsp; -noheader option in the CFE command.</p>									</div>
