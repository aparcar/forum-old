					<p>Hi,</p><p>first of all: OpenWRT is really great stuff! I&#039;m using White Russian 0.9.</p><p>I tested /etc/hotplug.d/button/... to work perfectly with all buttons on my WHR-G54S. Also for the BRI/AUTO button, a script is called.</p><p>However, since this is a switch, which can be &quot;on&quot; even when the unit is turned on, I was wondering how I can read the initial position after booting. Apparently, no hotplug.d/button script is called, when the button is already pressed during boot up. Also the gpio-Program is no longer part of OpenWRT.</p><p>Maybe someone can help me? I want to use the switch to change between two configurations and it would be not nice, if the user has to toggle it after every bootup :-)</p><p>Thanks,<br />Michael</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>really no one has an idea? It&#039;s &quot;just&quot; polling the status of a button rather than getting a script executed if the status changes... Probably, the gpio-program would already do the trick. Apparently, it is no longer included in WhiteRussian 0.9?</p><p>Thanks for your help,<br />Michael</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>hmm. What can I do to solve my problem? I checked all web sites / docs and could not find a hint how to directly poll the GPIO ports or the button (which is essentially the same, but may be more portable)...</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>									</div>
