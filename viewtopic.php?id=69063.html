					<p>Sorry If this was asked thousand of times, I&#039;m not really a expert or anything I was just having issues to get WAN settings with my stock firmware so I wanted to try OpenWRT.</p><p>I have a C6500 MODEM in bridge mode connected to WAN of WR941ND router. </p><p>I&#039;ve managed to have wireless and lan working but I can&#039;t get internet access and I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s failing to get wan settings like my stock firmware or if I did anything wrong. </p><p>Am I supposed to bridge the LAN to WLAN? </p><p>Can anyone give me a step by step to make it work that way ? Sorry if that&#039;s asking too much, I just want to access the internet without having to buy a new router. </p><p>All I really have done is to change wireless settings and lan to add google dns servers, other than that all is default.</p><p>Just to make crystal clear, I want this router to manage my wireless network and give me access to internet ( WAN) by using my modem that is in bridged mode connected to the wan port of the router.</p><p>Thanks by the way ! I&#039;m without internet access until I fix this...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, lan and wifi should be bridged-- so that all the users wired or wireless, are on the same LAN.&nbsp; This is the default.</p><p>On the main status page, do you see any IP on the WAN?&nbsp; It should be a public IP if everything is working.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 23 Dec 2016, 15:47)</p>
