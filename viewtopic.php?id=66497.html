					<p>I know it&#039;s been covered many times however I wanted to confirm what I believe is the correct setup after my research.</p><p>I have two devices running latest OpenWRT TP-Link WDR350 (My Main Router hooked up to cable modem) and I&#039;m now trying to cover a small part of the house where wireless drops out. To do so I&#039;m using a Dlink DIR505 running latest version of OpenWR.</p><p>The DIR505 is just being used to have clients connect to it via Wifi and pass the traffic to the main router (TP-Link WDR350)..&nbsp; I&#039;ve made sure It&#039;s placed in a location where Wifi connectivity is available.</p><p>For this am I setting up my bridge as &quot;Routed Client with relayd (Pseudobridge)&quot; ??<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a></p><p>Or am I missing something?</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually to be able to do what I was trying to do, the correct setup would be using WDS.</p><p>My intention is to just have wireless clients pass off to the router with a better signal and since I&#039;m using two OpenWRT devices I can do this.</p><p>A great tutorial for this is located here <a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com/wdsmode.html">http://ofmodemsandmen.com/wdsmode.html</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, however using WPS solution works better for me as it can switch devices based on quality of signal.</p>									</div>

					<p>if u r using same hws, i.e., all BCM or all Ath, you can use WDS. Otherwise relayd is a good idea.</p>									</div>
