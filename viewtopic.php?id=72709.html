					<p>Hi everyone , i am wondering if it is possible to do this :</p><p>My router have 1 wan port and 4 lan ports .</p><p>I want that the router act as a router delivering lan ip addresses between wan -&gt; lan ports (2,3,4)</p><p>and want a transparent bridge between port wan &amp; port 1 .</p><p>Is this even possible ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, of course it is possible: you just need to bridge both interfaces together, and adapt the configuration (IP address, DHCP, ...). Some routers have separated WAN and LAN interfaces on the CPU, some have just one interface, and separate them in the switch using VLANs; in the latter case, you could even bridge them together in the switch.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, this is possible. I&#039;ve configured this on several routers. Background: my cable internet provider&#039;s TV box needs a specific IP address (non-local) in a range that gets assigned from the WAN.</p><p>In the most recent firmware, it requests two IP address (via DHCP) with 2 different MAC addresses, but I haven&#039;t figured out yet how to accomplish a separation into two different VLANs based on MAC for the LAN1 port (if such a thing is possible).</p>									</div>

					<p>If your router is a typical GbE model with everything going through the switch, you can do that directly with switch configuration.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>If it has a dedicated CPU port that is directly wired to the WAN port on the back, bypassing the switch hardware, it is more complicated.&nbsp; You would need to set up a bridge in the kernel and use VLANs on the other eth port and switch to bring the WAN bridge out.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 5 Dec 2017, 17:01)</p>

					<p>The mapping of physical ports to the switch logical ports varies by router model and isn&#039;t always correct in Luci.&nbsp; Consult the wiki page for your model.</p><p>You can also find out which port is which by plugging and unplugging a cable and watching the connect status icons.&nbsp; </p><p>Evidently port 6 is connected to the CPU so eth0.1 is LAN and eth0.2 is WAN.&nbsp; Ethernet ports which are &quot;untagged&quot; in VLAN 1 (and &quot;off&quot; in 2) are in the LAN.&nbsp; Port(s) which are &quot;untagged&quot; in VLAN 2 (and &quot;off&quot; in 1) are the WAN.</p><p>What you posted doesn&#039;t make sense because there are only 4 ports active instead of 5.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 6 Dec 2017, 03:48)</p>

					<p>A switch doesn&#039;t have a MAC address.&nbsp; It passes packets along without changing their MAC address.</p><p>I assume you&#039;re doing something like connecting an IPTV box to a modem and also having your router get Internet access from the same modem.&nbsp; In some cases you&#039;ll also have to configure the switch for specific VLANs that the box and modem are using.</p>									</div>
