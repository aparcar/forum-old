					<p>Hi everyone,<br />I am new to openwrt.<br />I have bought a NETGEAR EX2700 a few months ago and recently discovered it was compatible with Openwrt firmware so I have decided to flash it. As the router has only a 4MB flash drive I wanted to make a custom Openwrt firmware and used &quot;firmware-tools&quot; project from GitHub to delete some packages from the image.<br />The image provided on openwrt website worked correctly but after flashing the custom firmware the router isn&#039;t showing any sign of life.<br />When I boot the router the power led isn&#039;t blinking and stays orange. I can&#039;t telnet/ssh even after manual network configuration on my pc. I have tried to boot into failsafe but I can&#039;t determine the exact point as the led isn&#039;t blinking (it did work with stock openwrt).<br />What can I do?<br />Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uchika96</strong> on 14 Dec 2016, 16:45)</p>

					<p>Have you tried nrmpflash as mentioned on the device wiki page?</p><p>Although it isn&#039;t mentioned in the wiki for that model so I don&#039;t know for sure, many Netgear routers go into TFTP recovery mode if you hold down the reset button while turning the power on.&nbsp; Keep holding it until the power LED changes to slowly blinking green.</p><p>The Image Builder is the recommended way to make a custom OpenWrt image with packages added or left out, instead of modifying the binary file.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 14 Dec 2016, 17:18)</p>
