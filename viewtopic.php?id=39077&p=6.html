					<p>In bridged repeater all the clients IP requests are redirected to the main router. Some routers don&#039;t work well with this.<br />Unbridged repeater doesn&#039;t do this, only the repeater request its own IP from the main router, and serves apart its own network, so the main router only sees one device connected to it<br />By hardware limitations I mean that some routers don&#039;t work if more than 1 wireless interface is set on the same hardware radio, so only AP or client mode can be set, but not both at the same time.<br />For what I see, the WA801 is not well supported, while it exists in the trunk,I don&#039;t see any wiki page or hardware info.<br />So maybe it won&#039;t work fine! Before buying any router check first on openwrt forum or wiki that it&#039;s stable!<br />Get a wr740 / wr741 , they work well and they are very cheap, the last I bought was 14 euro!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 5 Jun 2014, 01:18)</p>

					<p>Yes i did ..<br />The clients get the correct ip vom master router(Fritz 7490), dns all is right.<br />I think the cause of the problem is, that windows homegroup needs the NDP protocol, and NDP is part of IPV6.<br />In adition am able to ping pc&#039;s which are connected to the master router from Clients behind the repeater and vice cersa.</p><p>Ps: I am using WA850RE (atheros)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Rampler</strong> on 25 Jun 2014, 11:43)</p>

					<p>Mmm no idea about this. I use simple Windows folder sharing and works well.<br />Is the homework group seen within the openwrt network?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 26 Jun 2014, 04:35)</p>

					<p>Sorry, i dont understand your question:<br />Is the homework group seen within the openwrt network?</p><p>You see the windows homegroup only in the Windows Explorer (left side, over the harddiscs). Inside the exlporer i see my shared folders under the network section, after i installed avahi-demaon.</p><p>Problem is, that pc&#039;s which are connected behind the Bridge are unavailable for homegroups.</p><p>PS: After googling for that problem, it seems that many bridges have this problem .., its funny that this is known as a &quot;behind the bridge problem&quot; ..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Rampler</strong> on 27 Jun 2014, 09:06)</p>

					<p>finally a working guide, the bridge repeater from 1st post works great on 841nd with latest trunk barrier breaker<br />last year i bought a mikrotik rb951g-2hnd for main router and from that moment i couldn&#039;t make to work my 841nd and 741nd devices as a wireless repeater with gargoyle fw, the first working solution is this in the first post<br />and for noobs: you don&#039;t need to use vi editor, under windows with winscp is much easier, just scp to your router and click edit on network, wifi etc files then close and click save<br />you can backup these files too and after reinstall you just need to copy them back and reboot the device</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trance89</strong> on 28 Jun 2014, 21:35)</p>
