					<p>Just wanted to document these for anyone that needs them.</p><p>Followed the instructions on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/VPNC">http://wiki.openwrt.org/VPNC</a> . Worked fine, there was no need to change the scripts for ash like apparently there was in the WhiteRussian version. However, I have made some modifications as I only want selective routing through the VPN (the LAN is somewhat restrictive but I need to access it for some things) and I want it on 24/7. </p><p><strong>-- UPDATED AND SIMPLIFIED ---</strong></p><p>No vpnc-script changes are necessary. Instead I made a /etc/vpnc/custom-script file (make sure to chmod +x /etc/vpnc/custom-script) as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# this effectively disables changes to /etc/resolv.conf
INTERNAL_IP4_DNS=

# This sets up split networking regardless
# of the concentrators specifications.
#
# (This allows you to specify which routes go through the VPN)
CISCO_SPLIT=&quot;x.x.x.x/255.255.255.255/32 y.y.y.y/255.255.252.0/22 etc &quot;

    export CISCO_SPLIT_INC_${i}_ADDR=`echo $line | cut -d &#039;/&#039; -f 1`
    export CISCO_SPLIT_INC_${i}_MASK=`echo $line | cut -d &#039;/&#039; -f 2`
    export CISCO_SPLIT_INC_${i}_MASKLEN=`echo $line | cut -d &#039;/&#039; -f 3`
    i=`expr $i + 1`
done
export CISCO_SPLIT_INC=$i

    fi</code></pre></div><p><strong>2. Accessing your router from the network you are VPNing to</strong></p><p>Ssh back to my OpenWRT router did not work. At work (where I was VPNing to) there is a firewall/router that directs traffic out; apparently the router was sending requests on ppp0 but responding on tun0 which the router did not like. To fix this, figure out the IP(s) of your LAN router (I did this by ssh&#039;ing somewhere a couple of times and seeing where &quot;last logged in from&quot; would come up as). Then edit /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script, and add the following at the beginning of&nbsp; <br />start_vpn_nat:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>route add -net x.x.x.x/n dev ppp0</code></pre></div><p>and at the end of stop_vpn_nat:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>route del -net x.x.x.x/n dev ppp0</code></pre></div><p><strong>3. Directing certain other sites/subnets through the VPN</strong></p><p>We have some online subscriptions that can only be accessed from work. This is very similar to the above, with the following changes; To /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script after the line above add (for a subnet):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>route add -net x.x.x.x/n dev $TUNDEV</code></pre></div><p>or (for a host):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>route add -host x.x.x.x dev $TUNDEV</code></pre></div><p>Notice that these examples have <strong>$TUNDEV</strong> and the ones in the first section had <strong>ppp0</strong>. You want this traffic to <strong>go</strong> through the VPN, but in the first case you wanted the traffic that would be directed to the VPN to keep going through ppp0. Oh and in this case the tunnel will be closed on disconnect so no need to remove the rules upon closure.</p><p><strong>4. VPN rekeying or my vpnc is still alive after n hours but I don&#039;t actually have a VPN connection anymore</strong></p><p>This took some modifications. I finally went with the following, I added a CONNECTED_FILE in vpnc-script<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>DEFAULT_ROUTE_FILE=/var/run/vpnc/defaultroute
RESOLV_CONF_BACKUP=/var/run/vpnc/resolv.conf-backup
CONNECTED_FILE=/var/run/vpnc/connected</code></pre></div><p>which is written here:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>do_connect() {
        touch &quot;$CONNECTED_FILE&quot;
        
    if [ -n &quot;$CISCO_BANNER&quot; ]; then</code></pre></div><p>and removed here (at the end of do_disconnect()):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    if [ -n &quot;$INTERNAL_IP4_DNS&quot; ]; then
        reset_resolvconf
    fi
    
    rm &quot;$CONNECTED_FILE&quot;
}</code></pre></div><p>Then I made this my /etc/init.d/vpnc file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
START=75
STOP=10
start() {
        mkdir -p -m777 /var/run/vpnc
        vpnc /etc/vpnc/vpnc.conf
}
stop() {
        kill `cat /var/run/vpnc/pid`
        while [ -f /var/run/vpnc/connected ];
        do
           sleep 1
        done
}</code></pre></div><p>otherwise /etc/init.d/vpnc restart doesn&#039;t always wait long enough and masquerading ends up messed up.</p><p>Now for the actual restarting I just use cron, which seems to work:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>crontab -e</code></pre></div><p>and add a line something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Restart vpnc every six hours to avoid vpnc bugginess with rekeying
0 0,6,12,18 * * * /etc/init.d/vpnc restart</code></pre></div><p>For mine i do six hours. You should do a little less than whatever the n hours after which you notice a disconnect.</p><p>Finally, on Kamikaze 7.09 the /etc/rc.d/K* scripts don&#039;t get to finish on system shutdown (they run but since they are executed in the background, rcS ends before they finish and then init halts the system). Hence my VPN still thought I was connected if I did a reboot and I had to wait for the connection to timeout.</p><p>To fix this, I had to change /etc/init.d/rcS to the following (but do this at your own<br />risk as your router might not restart afterwards; I experienced this with a different rcS script initially):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if [ &quot;$1&quot; == &quot;K&quot; ]; then
        # Run synchronously
        {
                for i in /etc/rc.d/$1*; do
                        $i $2 2&gt;&amp;1
                done 
        } | logger -s -p 6 -t &#039;&#039;
else
        # Run asynchronously
        {
                for i in /etc/rc.d/$1*; do
                        $i $2 2&gt;&amp;1
                done 
        } | logger -s -p 6 -t &#039;&#039; &amp;
