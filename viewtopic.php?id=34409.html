					<p>Hi all,</p><p>It&#039;s been about 9 months since I last made a firmware for my router. I decided to wipe out the directory and start from scratch. I synced with the latest trunk as of this morning, and the latest feeds as well. I do the make menuconfig and select my device, the Soekris Net5501. I save the config. Then I open the new .config in a text editor, and also the one from target/linux/x86/net5501, the lines that are in the net5501 target.mk are not in the new one made.</p><p>How do I create the generic config for my device? I thought selecting my device was supposed to pull in the corresponding generic config on first creation of the config?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>edit: I meant the target.mk file in the net5501 directory, not the config file.</p>									</div>

					<p>For example, the target.mk file has this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>DEFAULT_PACKAGES += kmod-ata-via-sata kmod-crypto-hw-geode \
            kmod-gpio-cs5535 kmod-gpio-nsc kmod-gpio-pc8736x \

            kmod-i2c-algo-bit kmod-i2c-algo-pca kmod-i2c-algo-p</code></pre></div><p>However, after searching menuconfig for all gpio stuff to locate where it is, I go there, and it&#039;s not selected. So, I need to make sure it is all manually selected, but are there other things in the x86 dir that get added to it, like things that are common to all x86 devices?</p>									</div>

					<p>And now I know why my system won&#039;t even boot. I am doing a comparison with the kernel config in target/linux/x86/net5501 to the one in build_dir/linux-x86_net5501/linux-2.6.39.4 and most of the stuff isn&#039;t in that config. I do a make kernel_menuconfig and search for those symbols and most are not turned on like they should be. Only the sysmbols from the x86 directory default ones are used. This is a huge error that the sub-diretory net5501 config isn&#039;t also used as it contains all the specifics for my my system.</p><p>How do I go about fixing this?</p>									</div>

					<p>I removed the whole directory, and re-got svn trunk.</p><p>I was doing some more investigations, and I think you might be right that it&#039;s out of sync.

					<p>It looks like the Soekris net5501 was refreshed today with <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/29994">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/29994</a><br />So, you might test rebuilding everything. It might work ;-)</p>									</div>
