					<p>Dirtbag, the dir-615 isn&#039;t supported by the 8.09s, you have to use the trunk version instead, which also means it&#039;s more or less a bleeding edge platform for openwrt, so it might not work exactly how you want it.</p><p>I have a trendnet tew-632brp (more or less identical to dir-615 c1) which i flashed with a version from a snapshot some time ago, which worked OK.<br />But it isn&#039;t my &quot;primary&quot; router platform.</p><p>Also no guarantee can be given that it will actually work and you wont brick your router.<br />The best reccomendation i can give you is to search the forum, there&#039;s a few threads about this platform.</p>									</div>

Or is it not as simple as that?</p><p>-db</p></blockquote></div><p>db,</p><p>The link above is correct but since you&#039;re new to OpenWrt you may find it difficult to get going. If your router has f/w version 3.10NA or 3.11NA, you may need to edit the hex-id to get to install from within the existing f/w bin upgrade. The recovery mode might work but last time I tried it, the router NA f/w locks the router of third party f/w thanks to D-Link-see warning at their f/w d/l site. It&#039;s easy to bypass it if you use an editor to place two zeroes in front of the hex-id so it appears as &quot;00AP81-AR9130-RT-070614-02&quot; </p><p>Here&#039;s a good editor (do not use a text editor): <a href="http://dw.com.com/redir?edId=3&amp;siteId=4&amp;oId=3000-2352_4-10327521&amp;ontId=2352_4&amp;spi=ccedcc534fba9ca3ff7772b4e77bc0f6&amp;lop=link&amp;tag=tdw_dltext&amp;ltype=dl_dlnow&amp;pid=11156746&amp;mfgId=6263863&amp;merId=6263863&amp;pguid=Dx7X9QoPjAUAAG3ptYAAAAAN&amp;destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.cnet.com%2F3001-2352_4-10327521.html%3Fspi%3Dccedcc534fba9ca3ff7772b4e77bc0f6">http://dw.com.com/redir?edId=3&amp;site … b4e77bc0f6</a></p><p>Just scroll to bottom/right of opened file and add the zeroes and save. It should flash either method after that. I&#039;ve found that I don&#039;t have to edit the new trunks any longer so either a fix was added to trunk hex-id or someone got smart and edited the recovery flash at some point.</p><p>After flash, the next obstacle you may run into is the trunks lack all the Luci files needed to access the IP 192.168.1.1 GUI. I telnet 192.168.1.1 via the Windows Command Prompt and then:<br />opkg update (this requires INTERNET connection to load update packages)<br />opkg install Luci-admin-full<br />opkg install Luci-app-firewall<br />if needed opkg install Luci-fastindex (sometimes I need it, sometimes I don&#039;t (?)), otherwise the GUI will not be found and won&#039;t launch<br />from there you should be able to log-in, set password and configure...if you prefer to SSH and configure, you won&#039;t need Luci just set password in telnet</p><p>BTY, a lot of newcomers don&#039;t know what the recovery flash is. It&#039;s used to recover a bricked router, that is if the bricking didn&#039;t overwrite the revovery mode. To get to it, cycle power to router and hold the reset button until the power LED flashes. Your PC should be connected directly to LAN of router and you may need to remove all other LAN connections. Then set your PC to manually obtain an IP address from gateway 192.168.0.1, you&#039;ll have to manually assign the address for PC in that range, for example, 192.168.0.2, subnet mask 255.255.255.0</p><p>After flashing, you&#039;ll find it a good habit to cycle power to router (wait until 100% loaded) after cycling power to modem (only if router is primary DHCP router) and waiting for modem ready light. THat way your INTERNET connection is ready for the Opkg Update.</p><p>You&#039;ll find a lot useful information and support in this thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18314&amp;p=1">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 14&amp;p=1</a></p>									</div>
