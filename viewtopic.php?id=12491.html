					<p>I managed to get two WGT634Us to ping each other via the Roofnet interfaces, but I can&#039;t find any good examples of how to setup the Roofnet routing.&nbsp; I can get one to advertise itself as a gateway, but that doesn&#039;t seem to be enough by itself.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that Click will somehow take care of adding it to the routing table.</p><p>Also, is there a package for kclick, the kernel module based on click?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve deployed a 10-nodes wireless mesh network using roofnet and kamikaze. All the nodes are WGT634U. Which problems are you facing?</p><p>If it could be useful I can post both the package and the makefile. However i will need some time in order to do that. The makefile that I&#039;m using<br />contains several hacks and would not work inside another envviroment.</p><p>Bye</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, thanks for getting this working on the WGT634U.&nbsp; I&#039;m now trying to get it to work on the Meraki Mini.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m getting a strange error when I try to install it using ipkg.&nbsp; Have you tried getting it to work on the Meraki?&nbsp; I can&#039;t see why it wouldn&#039;t, but the ipk is not letting me install it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>i&#039;ve uploaded an updated version of the roofnet distribution for openwrt. It is tested on netgear wgt634u. </p><p>The package nows uses the official openwrt configuration infrastructure so you can now modify the mesh<br />configuration using uci. Moreover it does not requires anymore the ruby package in that the startup of<br />the mesh is handled using a init script.</p><p>Here is the website link:</p><p><a href="http://www.wing-project.org">www.wing-project.org</a></p><p>Roberto</p>									</div>
