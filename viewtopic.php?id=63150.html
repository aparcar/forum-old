					<p>I setup a TP Link TL WDR3600 for my brother in law with stock firmware.&nbsp; He had Comcast with 100Mbps.&nbsp; He would use speedtest on his iPhone and would usually be able to get around 91 MBps on the speedtest scores on the 5GHZ band.</p><p>However he uses Chromecasts and the 2.4ghz band on the router would get lost or disconnect.&nbsp; I decided to install OpenWRT since I setup one for my sister about 2 years ago with Attitude Adjustment and she never has any problems with speed or connections.</p><p>I guess the only option is to install Chaos Calmer on my brothers WDR3600.&nbsp; I installed Chaos calmer it and hooked it back to his modem and reboot everything.&nbsp; It seems that the WDR3600 takes a long time to find the modem on the WAN port.&nbsp; Also his wifi on 5ghz is only giving him 50Mbps.&nbsp; However hardwire he is getting 100 Mbps.&nbsp; However the signal seems to be more solid than the stock firmware.</p><p>He is now wanting me to go back because he wants the full speed he is paying for on wireless.&nbsp; </p><p>So my question is it a setting on OpenWRT that I have incorrectly set or is the Stock Firmware much better at giving wireless speed?&nbsp; If so I will let him choose between reliability (OpenWRT) vs speed (stock).</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

Unless you meant 91 Mbps, a 91 MBps is about 728 Mbps and is way beyond a 100 Mbps connection. If the measurement was done within the gigabit LAN connection, then it will probably be OK.</p>									</div>

					<p>As another owner of WDR3600 (as a backup router tho), I can say that I prefer running AA over CC on it. Unless you absolutely need the new features CC brought (like IPv6 support) I&#039;d stay with AA.</p>									</div>
