					<p>Just wondering, I&#039;d really like to get Chaos Calmer with LUCi into my v11, I&#039;m fairly comfortable with moving images around at least in the general sense. Would it make more sense right now to just grab v10 and put it in over the serial port (because I guess any other way would reject it)? Is there a script lying around for that that I could follow to do that? If not is there both a good image and instructions for another approach? (I didn&#039;t have much trouble picking up the TFTP approach because there was a nice video to watch, for serial right now it&#039;s not quite so well laid out but I ordered one of these USB-serial jobs and it just came in because I figured I&#039;d be in trouble if I didn&#039;t have one available.)</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s the non-EU that I need. Could you elaborate a little? I see the sysupgrade command page and the -F option looks a bit risky, I can&#039;t actually find any detailed instructions on this site using it, don&#039;t want to brick anything before its time. Are you saying for the second part you just identify certain packages that implement LUCi from v10 and sysupgrade them, or do you bring the whole image over and it &quot;just happens&quot; to reside offset to the first image somehow? I don&#039;t want to make this uber-geeky but I want to have some principle that I&#039;m thinking at least ought to work, it sort of sounds like &quot;there was expected to be&quot; a real non-EU v11 build by now but if I have a little clearer idea how this works I&#039;ll likely get it OK.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jlawton</strong> on 29 Nov 2016, 17:52)</p>

					<p>OK now what I&#039;m seeing is confusing me. Got v11.1 hardware, want to go in load the trunk from factory then do the sysupgrade -F with v10 to get back LUCi. So right now I&#039;ve just got the factory restored code, wanted to be sure I wasn&#039;t taking any steps I couldn&#039;t easily undo. Hooked up serial port and I didn&#039;t see the &quot;autobooting...&quot; message but there were a few lines of garbled stuff at the beginning. Fooled around with the port settings and if I set the port to 7 chars 2 stop bits then I see all of the serial info clearly and NOW I CAN SEE the autobooting message but it&#039;s not responding to a tpl. Is that typical behavior for the factory load? (Oh yeah it doesn&#039;t take the tpl with the port at 8/1 where I&#039;m guessing when the msg SHOULD come up either.) I&#039;m not exactly an expert at what I&#039;m looking at but I &quot;have a hunch&quot; I&#039;m just supposed to be &quot;getting the attention&quot; of the bootloader to start the console so loading trunk first shouldn&#039;t change that. If what I&#039;m seeing makes sense and you can explain a little then maybe I should go ahead to trunk but I&#039;m a little uncertain that what I&#039;m seeing makes sense. Is there any way to issue that sysupgrade command without using the serial port? (Apologize again for my ignorance, very sorry!)</p>									</div>

					<p>Let me clarify my previous message, with the TL-WR841N v11.1 hardware I don&#039;t seem to be able to get a bootloader prompt even though I can see the proper serial data and amplitude leaving the port. Serial adapter is a Frentaly CH340G and software is PuTTY 0.67 on Windows 7 Professional. I&#039;m even trying to find if it could accept a &quot;break&quot; or other special character but haven&#039;t found anything. I&#039;m leaving it in 115200-8N1 mode when I&#039;m not experimenting although it seems curious nobody mentioned the scrambled-looking data because that could be a clue too, yeah maybe it&#039;s just I&#039;m not in proper charset but I&#039;m wondering if they went and put the bootloader portion under a different protocol? (Maybe they&#039;re thinking they&#039;re trying to use this to protect IP? It&#039;s just curious that&#039;s all, I could be WAY off.) It&#039;s just I don&#039;t see how to get a build with a decent version of fq-codel on this unit without serial port access with the current state of CC for this HW.</p>									</div>

					<p>Some more datapoints. I have a 841N(TPD) ver 9.0, ver 10.0 and ver 11.1, all bought in EU.</p><p>For the project I&#039;m working on I need 15.05.1 but I had to re-build the firmware image to eliminate things I don&#039;t need, to get space for the things I want which would not fit otherwise.<br />Currently running <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 r49389 / LuCI for-15.05 branch (git-16.344.58491-d4bec26) </p><p>I note that the 9.0, the 10.0 and the 11.1 hardware flashes correctly, from the stock TP-link firmware, using the image I built earlier today: <br />&nbsp; openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-vXX-squashfs-factory.bin<br />where XX is v9, v10 or v11 respectively. No need to patch the images; just configure, build, flash and off it goes. That may not be true for the 15.05.1 release images, it is true when using the images I built today. </p><p>There are two quite visible hardware differences between v10.0 and v11.1 hardware. <br />For one, the WAN LED is now bi-color, can be green or orange. Flipping the tp-link:green:wlan LED makes the LED light up orange, not green, green still seems to indicate WAN activity.<br />The second difference is that the shape of the antenna is different, the v9.0 and v10.0 box have identical antennas; the v11.1 antennas are bigger and look like the antennas used on Archer-C7 machines. They are still non-detachable though.</p><p>One more comment: these units have 4MB of flash and that is &quot;taxing it&quot; with 15.05 firmware. I use these units for a multi-unit wifi network (at a unit price of EUR 17 they are hard to beat) but I saw someone wanting to experiment creating an eduroam proxy and the like. Please do realize that the flash constraint does make for a challenge, if this is your first OpenWRT experiment then I would suggest to use a box with more resources (like the aforementioned Archer C7) because you can use the stock OpenWRT image and just add packages, which you cannot do with the &#039;841 because you will run out of space.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Geert Jan</p>									</div>
