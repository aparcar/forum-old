					<p>Hello All,</p><p>Can&#039;t find bin file! :</p><p>I have an ubiquiti Unifi UAP AC Outdoor and i would like to put OpenWRT on it, but i went to the Table Of Hardware then clicked on Unifi AC and found under installing OpenWRT that the file location was openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-unifiac-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin and could not find the file. </p><p>Ubiquiti Unifi UAP AC Outdoor can load bin file from web server page. :</p><p>I have tired using ddwrt and was able to put it my device by holding reset button for 15 secs after i plug power into the device then going to 192.168.1.20 with my pc having a static ip uploading fireware then this device restarts after upload with correct firmware.</p><p>How stable is the OpenWRT on this device? :</p><p>DDWRT was not stable it lost communication to ethernet ports after creating vlans. I am trying to find an alternative to ubiquiti&#039;s unifi controller idea which is not feasible to my application. Any input would be helpful thank you!</p>									</div>
