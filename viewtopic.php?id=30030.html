					<p>Hi,</p><p>i know there are many discussions about failover WAN and Mesh Networking. However, I decided to ask in my own Thread because I haven&#039;t found the solution I want to build so far...</p><p>I WANT TO...:<br />* <strong>connect two or more offices</strong> thru VPN Connections<br />* have <strong>seamless failover</strong> between all my WAN-Connections <br />&nbsp; (which are in preferred order: WIFI-WAN, direct PPTP between my routers over DSL (LAN), bridged PPTP-Tunnels over HSDPA to my internet-accessable Server)<br />&nbsp; I think of handling this with a MESH over the WAN-Interfaces?<br />* have a <strong>Mesh network on LAN</strong> on each router - wired and wireless (preferred BATMAN)<br />* Want to update the router software remotly &amp; keep the config</p><p>I HAVE...:<br />* compiled OpenWrt trunk for my TP-Link WR1943ND<br />* running Wifi-Wan connection<br />* running UMTS-Wan connection<br />* (currently I do not have a connection over LAN to my DSL-Router, which should work later)<br />* can switch connections by changing default routes (which takes some time and drops TCP-Connections)<br />* on the LAN-Side have LAN &amp; Wifi-LAN running &amp; working.</p><p>My questions are:<br />* As I will have multiple links between some routers: how can I switch them seamlessly if a connection fails? Is something like this possible with BATMAN (having running both links, but only use one until it fails)<br />* I want to have MESH-Networks over cable LAN where possible and over Wifi where necessary (so that I can mix these techniques). Is BATMAN the right for this &amp; where do I start reading?<br />* (less priority) is there a possibility to update the firmware of the router on the router itself (a script to download the sysupgrade-file, flash from inside the router, reboot, start a script adapting settings)</p><p>I know - many questions at once... sorry for that. <br />I just want to get sure to get it BEFORE bricking some of my routers ;-)</p><p>Thanks in advance for any hint and answer!<br />Best regards, Florian.</p>									</div>
