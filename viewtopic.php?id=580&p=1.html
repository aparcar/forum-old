I&#039;m getting sick and tired of everyone starting a new thread for their broken routers; it just clutters up the search results making it harder to find answers.</p><p>This thread is a collection of the various threads on the subject; please don&#039;t start any more threads on the subject.</p><p><strong>General advice:</strong></p><p>Set boot_wait. Enabling this option makes it much easier to recover firmwares; everyone who actually read the userguide should have it set.</p><p>Try failsafe mode. Power up, wait for the DMZ led, hold down the reset button for 2 seconds.<br />WARNING: holding down the reset button while powering up <strong>will unset boot_wait</strong> and restore nvram to factory defaults - wait for the DMZ led.</p><p>DO NOT RETURN BROKEN ROUTERS. Admit the fact that you broke it and fix it yourself; loading 3rd party firmwares is not covered by waranty.</p><p><strong>WRT54G: (4M intel/amd flash)</strong></p><p>Shorting pins 15-16 generally works to recover from a broken firmware. Unplug, short pins, plug in ..</p><p>To fix a corrupted NVRAM, such as the (now fixed) commit bug on the v1.0, power up, wait for all the switch leds to light then short pins 2-3. If it&#039;s a v2.0 you can just do the reset trick above.</p><p><strong>WRT54GS: (8M intel flash)</strong></p><p>Shorting pins 5-6 generally works to recover from a broken firmware. Unplug, short pins, plug in ..</p><p><strong>What the hell does shorting the pins do / how do you know what pins?</strong></p><p>The pins listed are address lines, if you grab the datasheet for any of the flash chips they&#039;ll be shown as a0, a1, a2 ...</p><p>Each address line represents 1 bit -- Suppose you wanted the 12th byte off the chip, 12 translates to 1100 in binary which means you&#039;d need 4 address lines and they&#039;d be set on or off (voltage, no voltage) depending on if the bit is 1 or 0.</p><p>If you short the pins, that changes the address the chip sees as requested. Continuing with the earlier example, suppose of those 4 address lines, the middle two were shorted:</p><p>-XX-</p><p>The requested address, 1100 gets seen as 1110; a request for address 12 got turned into a request for address 14. Likewise 3 (0011) becomes 7 (0110), 4 (0100) becomes 6 (0110) .. etc.</p><p>Result: It&#039;s actually impossible to read the value at 12 in this case, and it&#039;s likely that address 14 holds a different value. If this were a firmware, the bootloader would attempt to verify the firmware on bootup with a CRC check, mangling the addresses would change the data read and the CRC wouldn&#039;t match.</p><p>In the end, there&#039;s nothing really magical about pins 15-16; you can pick any address lines and short them and *something* will happen; if you didn&#039;t short the addresses of the bootloader there&#039;s a good chance it&#039;ll boot up and wait for a firmware.</p><br /><p>mbm<br />- moderator</p></blockquote></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p><span style="color: red"><br />This hw fix applies to the wrt54g version 2 hardware ONLY (US version).&nbsp; I have not tried it on any other units.</span></p><p><span style="color: red">User&#039;s assume ALL risk in utilizing this information in any manner what so ever.</span></p><p><span style="color: red">If you do not take full responsibility for your own actions, don&#039;t read this post any further.</span></p><p><span style="color: red">This may ruin you wrt54g Version 2 HW, or other hw, if not a wrt54g, and god know what other possible harm may come to you or others using this information.

It&#039;s a funny story, but this post is already running way long.</p><p>Here are my lessons learned:</p><p>1) Use a normal tftp client for attempting to send an image during the boot_wait interval.<br />1a&nbsp; Be sure binary mode in enabled,<br />1b&nbsp; Set the retransmission interval (rexmt 1) in the tftp client to 1 second. Mine defaulted to 5 (you can miss lots of windows with the 5 second interval)<br />1c&nbsp; With one of my units the tftps were starting, but failing to complete. I needed to go to 10Mb hub and try several times before it completed correctly.<br />1d&nbsp; If you are familiar with ethereal or other sniffers, it useful to monitor the packets into and out of the unit. That&#039;s how I knew, the tftp&#039;s were actually starting, but not finishing&nbsp; (no last packet).<br />1e&nbsp; the status command in the tftp client shows you mode, retransmission intervals and other stuff, use it a check before you type the put code.bin command<br />1f&nbsp; try to uses a known good images (in my case the image was not known to work on the v2 units)<br />1g&nbsp; I used the arp -s command to statically set the MAC addr of the wrt (it&#039;s on the bottom of the unit).<br />1i&nbsp; my tftp client is tftp-hpa 0.34 (just fyi for the curious or desperate)</p><p>These steps allowed me to de-brick 1 of my three units. The other 2 seemed toast. 1 was rebooting every 3 seconds, and the other was KNOWN to have boot_wait=off and rebooting every 15-20 seconds.</p><p>Did I say you should try this at you own risk ? It&#039;s all up to you.</p><p>The last 2 units we revived by shorting two pins on the flash chip. Specifically, white stenciled pins 15-16 near the LED end of the board. </p><p>With the unit that was rebooting every 3 seconds, I kept moving along the address line pins. I had kind of given up hope with the method, when the unit stopped rebooting and I saw the tftp xfer in the ethereal window. The first time surprised me and freaked me out a little. I had to power cycle the unit and find the pins again. I just shorted pins 15-16 together (note there is a white hash mark every 5 pins) and let the unit reboot.&nbsp; &nbsp;The tftp was running all the time with a 1 second rxmit interval and a timeout of 360 or 6 minutes of attempting before reissuing the command. Just like that, the unit was re-flashed.&nbsp; I waited for a couple minutes after the tftp completed (via live scrolling in ethereal) and it woke up de-bricked running the linksys firmware (with a minor ping tweak).</p><p>2 units de-bricked, 1 to go.</p><p>The flash pin short worked so well, I had to try it on the unit with the boot_wait=off. I had heard there was a tiny window during boot, even with boot_wait=off. I needed to have somebody power-on the unit while I was holding the short on the pins 15-16.&nbsp; You just keep those pins shorted and power-on as the tftp attempts are happening every second and it worked on the first real attempt.</p><p>All three unit fully recovered.&nbsp; Ready to test the next b4-pre.</p><p>Yes, I verified boot_wait=off on that unit. It was quickly changed to boot_wait=on and committed. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Good Luck fellow adventurers.</p><p>Thanks again [mbm], mjn3, and gps. I don&#039;t know who the other dev&#039;s are.</p><p>[g2]</p><p>Oh yeah, last but not least,&nbsp; Ksilebo THANKS for hosting this wonderful effort!</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for writing this up; i&#039;m sure it&#039;ll help someone else.</p><p>if you have units with boot_wait=on already you should not need to do any of the flash pin shorting and such mentioned above.&nbsp; just tftp an image named code.bin&nbsp; right after power on as described.</p><p>i had an extra ethernet interface on a computer connected directly to the switch ports on the unit when tftping.&nbsp; no intermediate devices and no need to force it to 10Mbit/sec or half duplex or anything.&nbsp; the unit will always be 192.168.1.1 for the failsafe tftp load.&nbsp; configure your network interface to 192.168.1.somethingelse</p><p>also i never needed to make a static arp entry any of the times i&#039;ve used tftp to upload firmware (either debricking a boot_wait=off messed up unit by causing a crc error in the flash or uploading normally to a boot_wait=on system).&nbsp; this is odd because some of the time i failed to notice the unit respond to an arp request for 192.168.1.1 so i don&#039;t know how my machine got the mac addr...&nbsp; i probably wasn&#039;t watching the tcpdump close enough.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I think I&#039;ve killed my WRT54G (v2). That&#039;s the actual state:<br />-On startup first power-led blinks, after same seconds power-led and dmz-led are on, some seconds later dmz-led is off and the switch-leds indicate the connected computers<br />-The switch isn&#039;t working when two computers are connected (hardware failure? or software needed?)<br />-I can&#039;t ping the router, even when started with reset button pressed (IP 192.168.1.1)<br />-I can&#039;t flash the router via tftp (boot_wait seems off)<br />-Even when I brick pin 15-16 of the flash chip, I can&#039;t ping (192.168.1.1 right?) the router. But the power-led blinks, so it seemed to work.</p><p>That&#039;s what I did:<br />I build the firmware from actual cvs this morning and flashed it via tftp (before that I set boot_wait to on and disabled the wlan via the webfrontend of the original firmware). All that worked well and I installed some packages (openswan, ssh-server). Then I wanted to set up the WLAN interface. Because I disabled the wlan before in the original firmware I thought it were the best idea to reset the router (pressed the reset button on startup). After that the WLAN-led was off and there was no wlan interface (iwconfig). Then I noticed that many values from the nvram list went away (wl*) and I set them from the list in the wiki. But that didn&#039;t help. Then I noticed that the wl module wasn&#039;t loaded (dmesg showed eth1: 3.50.21.10 driver failed with code 30). When I tried to load the module width insmod wl I got the following message: insmod: init_module: wl: No such device (and eth1: 3.50.21.10 driver failed with code 30 via dmesg). I asked the people in #wrt54g on freenode and someone gave me his nvram value list. After setting this values and rebooting the router was dead.<br />Is it possible that some nvram values &quot;killed&quot; the router, so that it is even impossible to flash via tftp? I also tried to reset the router with the reset button (30s when running, 30s without power and 39s at startup) after that, but that didn&#039;t help.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Here&#039;s the list with the values I set:<br />[code]<br />nvram set wl0_net_mode=mixed<br />nvram set os_ram_addr=80001000<br />nvram set wl0_frameburst=on<br />nvram set boardrev=0x10<br />#nvram set il0macaddr=00:90:4c:5f:00:2a<br />nvram set ppp_idletime=3600<br />#nvram set et0macaddr=00:0F:66:30:F8:98<br />nvram set wl0_wep_buf=<br />nvram set boot_wait=1<br />nvram set watchdog=5000<br />nvram set wl0_macmode1=disabled<br />nvram set wl0_infra=1<br />nvram set wl0_country_code=AU<br />nvram set et0mdcport=0<br />nvram set pmon_ver=CFE 3.51.21.0<br />nvram set wl0_ifname=eth1<br />nvram set gpio2=adm_eecs<br />nvram set gpio3=adm_eesk<br />nvram set gpio5=adm_eedi<br />nvram set vlan0ports=1 2 3 4 5*<br />nvram set gpio6=adm_rc<br />nvram set wl0_mode=ap<br />nvram set os_flash_addr=bfc40000<br />nvram set wl0_gmode=1<br />nvram set sromrev=2<br />nvram set boardtype=0x0101<br />nvram set static_route=<br />nvram set wl0_wep_last=<br />nvram set lan_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />nvram set wl0_dtim=1<br />nvram set wl0_ssid=linksys<br />nvram set ppp_redialperiod=30<br />nvram set wl0_key1=<br />nvram set wl0id=0x4320<br />nvram set wl0_key2=<br />nvram set wl0_key3=<br />nvram set wl0_key4=<br />nvram set ag0=255<br />nvram set wl0_plcphdr=long<br />nvram set wl0_rate=0<br />nvram set wl0_closed=0<br />nvram set wl0_macmode=disabled<br />nvram set wl0_radioids=BCM2050<br />nvram set wl0_phytype=g<br />nvram set wl0gpio2=0<br />nvram set wl0_lazywds=1<br />nvram set wl0gpio3=0<br />nvram set boardflags2=0<br />nvram set wl0_antdiv=-1<br />nvram set wl0_wpa_psk=<br />nvram set wl0_mac_list=<br />nvram set wan_proto=pppoe<br />nvram set wl0_unit=0<br />nvram set wl_country_code=AU<br />nvram set tz=CEST<br />nvram set pa0itssit=62<br />nvram set wl0_wds=<br />nvram set cctl=0<br />nvram set lan_dns=192.168.0.5<br />nvram set wl0_radius_port=1812<br />nvram set wl0_mac_deny=<br />nvram set wl0_auth=0<br />nvram set wl0_radius_ipaddr=<br />nvram set pa0maxpwr=0x48<br />nvram set clkfreq=200<br />nvram set lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.1<br />nvram set lan_proto=static<br />nvram set vlan1hwname=et0<br />nvram set aa0=3<br />nvram set wl0_phytypes=g<br />nvram set wl0_frag=2346<br />nvram set wl0_wep=off<br />#nvram set sdram_config=0x0032<br />nvram set wl0_country=Worldwide<br />nvram set vlan1ports=0 5<br />nvram set scratch=a0180000<br />nvram set ccode=0<br />nvram set wl0_rateset=default<br />nvram set wl0_wep_bit=64<br />nvram set pppoe_idletime=3600<br />nvram set lan_ifname=vlan0<br />nvram set boardflags=0x0188<br />nvram set wl0_afterburner_override=-1<br />#nvram set sdram_refresh=0x0000<br />#nvram set sdram_ncdl=0x2031f<br />nvram set ppp_user=<br />nvram set ppp_password=<br />nvram set wl0_passphrase=<br />nvram set wl0_rts=2347<br />nvram set wl0_wpa_gtk_rekey=3600<br />nvram set wl0_key=1<br />nvram set wl0_active_mac=<br />nvram set et0phyaddr=30<br />nvram set wan_ifname=vlan1<br />nvram set wl0_radio=1<br />nvram set wl0_bcn=100<br />nvram set wl0_hwaddr=00:90:4C:5F:00:2A<br />nvram set wl0_wep_gen=<br />nvram set wl0_gmode_protection=auto<br />nvram set pa0b0=0x170c<br />nvram set wl0_maclist=<br />nvram set pa0b1=0xfa24<br />nvram set pa0b2=0xfe70<br />#nvram set sdram_init=0x0000<br />nvram set vlan0hwname=et0<br />nvram set dl_ram_addr=a0001000<br />nvram set wl0_radius_key=<br />nvram set wl0_corerev=7<br />nvram set wl0_channel=6<br />nvram set wl0_auth_mode=disabled<br />nvram set boot_ver=v2.3<br />nvram set boardnum=42<br />[/code]<br />[/code]</p>									</div>

					<p>On the v2 and GS you can reset NVRAM to some rather bare defaults by holding down the reset button while plugging in the power; should solve the vlan* problem but it will unset boot_wait.</p>									</div>

					<p>I solved the problem.

					<p>Hi all !</p><p>I have compiled and flashed OpenWRT (snapshot 20040807) onto my WRT54GS, which now is not accessible anymore. I&#039;ve switched on boot_wait before flashing, but tftp doesn&#039;t seem to work.</p><p>Has anyone used the tftp procedure on the WRT54GS device?<br />Has anyone successfully re-animated a WRT54GS device?</p><p>*** Details: (basically following <a href="http://www.openwrt.org/userguide.html">www.openwrt.org/userguide.html</a> )<br />Using the buildroot tarball, I built the toolchain and OpenWRT firmware files (openwrt-g-code.bin, openwrt-gs-code.bin). I then flashed a WRT54G device with the corresponding *g-code.bin file using tftp (tftp-hpa 0.33, with readline). All worked fine, including the boot_wait feature. The device works great; df reports 1812k memory available on /dev/mtdblock/4 after installing dropbear.</p><p>Now, trying tftp on my second box (the GS version), I can&#039;t get the firmware to load within the boot_wait period. I&#039;ve verified boot_wait=on as per above userguide, but even after about 30 attempts to flash the *gs-code.bin, still no success. I then used the webinterface to flash. The progress indicator (horizontal lines) had only reached about 1/4 of the total field, when suddenly the screen &quot;Successfully flashed&quot; appeared (that seems suspicious to me). After a power cycle on the box, the power LED doesn&#039;t stop blinking and I can&#039;t telnet into the box, nor ping it successfully.</p><p>One thing I noticed when plugging in power on the GS device was, that the DMZ and WLAN LEDs flash for a split second, even before the Power LED starts blinking and LAN1-4 and Internet light up for 1sec, then turn off. The G box does NOT do that. My assumption is, that the GS box performs some sort of reset or flush on the Intel flash that prevents the boot_wait procedure to perform normally. Maybe Linksys doesn&#039;t want us to hack this powerhouse of router!?</p><p>Has anyone seen something like that on the GS box before?</p><p>I have tried Void Main&#039;s &#039;recipe&#039; for reviving a v1.1 G-box, but shorting pins 15-16 doesn&#039;t do the trick on the GS box. <a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/redhat/wrt54g_revival.html">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/redhat/wr … vival.html</a></p><p>The original firmware was VER:2.07.1, and there is a hand-written date code on the PCB saying 6/18.</p><p>I will keep trying to reanimate the box, but in the meantime I have enough paper that needs to be held down by a neat-looking brick.</p><p>Thanks for any hints in advance.<br />- Gromit.</p>									</div>
