					<p>I&#039;m wondering how best OpenWRT can be upgraded remotely.</p><p>For a production environment, you have to cater for the possibility that despite the best efforts of change management, that a remote upgrade will fail, leaving you with an unworkable unit. </p><p>OpenWRT has reached the stage where it&#039;s suitable for large scale rollouts, if only a mechanism existed to make sure that if an upgrade fails, the system could fall back to booting off a different partition.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sounds great, but there is a real problem.&nbsp; There just isn&#039;t enough space on the flash to hold a new and current image.&nbsp; </p><p>Upgrading openwrt with mtd is reliable.&nbsp; The key is making sure you nvram is ready for the new image on reboot.&nbsp; </p><p>Extensive testing of your configuration with your environment is critical.&nbsp; You may be looking at custom building each .trx for each wrt so that it is configured as needed.&nbsp; </p><p>I think a large scale rollout is completely possible.&nbsp; Attention to detail and planning a always necessary.</p>									</div>
