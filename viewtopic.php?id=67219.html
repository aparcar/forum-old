					<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">LMGTFY</a></p><p>TL;DR -<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Markus Kuhn wrote:</cite><blockquote><ul><li><p>The tty driver of any POSIX system supports a “cooked” mode, in which some primitive line editing functionality is available. In order to allow the character-erase function (which is activated when you press backspace) to work properly with UTF-8, someone needs to tell it not count continuation bytes in the range 0x80-0xBF as characters, but to delete them as part of a UTF-8 multi-byte sequence. Since the kernel is ignorant of the libc locale mechanics, another mechanism is needed to tell the tty driver about UTF-8 being used. Linux kernel versions 2.6 or newer support a bit IUTF8 in the c_iflag member variable of struct termios. If it is set, the “cooked” mode line editor will treat UTF-8 multi-byte sequences correctly. This mode can be set from the command shell with “stty iutf8”. Xterm and friends should set this bit automatically when called in a UTF-8 locale.</p></li></ul></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>Ok. Since stty is not part of current busybox, I installed coreutils-stty. But trying out <em>stty iutf8</em> had no effect. In addition to LANG, I tried setting LC_ALL, but the result was the same.</p><p>Logging into my TP-Link from either Ubuntu 14.04 or OS X El Capitan the problem remained. Both of these do not have the problem by themselves, but only when I am logged in to the TP-Link.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Thinkcat</strong> on 29 Aug 2016, 15:44)</p>

					<p>I am running Chaos Calmer (15.05.1, r48532) with 3.18.23. With <em>stty cooked</em> I get &quot;C6&quot; instead of &#039;ö&#039; and &quot;C$&quot; instead of &#039;ä&#039;.
