					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a ZTE 3G router that I would like to use to access a openwrt and my webserver. I have tested port forwarding on ZTE and it has been working perfectly. I tried to forward port 80 to surveillance system gui and it worked like charm. I tried same thing with the openwrt router, but couldn&#039;t access it.</p><p>Now in my setup I have forwarded port 81 from outside to openwrt router and in firewall config is like that:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect
option target &#039;DNAT&#039;
option src &#039;wan&#039;
option dest &#039;lan&#039;
option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
option src_dport &#039;81&#039;
option dest_port &#039;80&#039;
option name &#039;NEWTEST&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I tested it with port check tool and it isn&#039;t open. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I tested it in local zte network, and 192.168.0.98:81 opened luci page. What could be the problem?</p><p>Using Barrier Braker, that I compiled.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kaar3l</strong> on 8 Jan 2015, 14:58)</p>

					<p>One step closer: I changed openwrt router to get ip from dhcp, and tried forwarded from zte. To the ip it got from zte router. Now it works, but when I enable static ip, it doesn&#039;t work. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>									</div>
