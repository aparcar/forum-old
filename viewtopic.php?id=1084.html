					<p>WoW! I&#039;am (as usual) very interested in this, beause it makes the opportunity for my firmware project to run on the old/very new WAP54g devices also. (V1.0 has 2 Mb flash, V2.0-de has 4 Mb and the actual version selled here in DE obviously only has 2 Mb again). That patch may shrink the firmware below the threshold of 2 Mb...</p><p>Anyway - do you see any drawbacks, if I make the general assumption that only 8 Mb of RAM are available? Gunzipped kernel size is 1642496/0x191000, this leaves 454656/0x6f000 bytes on top of expanded kernel.</p><p>TIA, Sven-Ola</p>									</div>

					<p>Changing the top address to 8MiB should be pretty safe, perhaps even 4MiB is ok but I can&#039;t tell how much it would go in reality with the kernel features people out there might enable/add, so it might not.</p><p>I don&#039;t have any of those units, but I can try the BZ_MEM_TOP:=0x80800000 version on my WRT at least, maybe later tonight or tomorrow.&nbsp; This doen&#039;t guarantee it working on WAP, but it&#039;ll never work otherwise.</p><p>If you are going to try it yourself, tripple check the boot_wait is enabled before trying.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to warn everyone - mjn3 code will not work on units other than wrt54g - it uses byte access to flash, which does not work with 16-bit configurations like wl500g has. Also, there is a problems with caches - both data and instruction - mjn3 code never worked for me (also, it was never used by openwrt - probably due to mistake in the build scripts)...<br />In fact, I&#039;ve already made lzma kernel decompressor, which works fine with wl500g/wl500g deluxe boxes and sent it to Kaloz a month ago... <br />I&#039;m attaching it just in case. The code is intended to be compiled outside kernel tree and does not require recompilation when kernel changes. It&#039;s just occupies first trx partition, leaving second and third for kernel and filesystem. This makes it very easy to use. Also, it should work with 8MB of RAM units. The kernel image should be compressed using lzma stream mode. Anyway, check README and let me know if you&#039;ve questions.</p>									</div>

					<p>@mtakahar/oleg: now it seems to work on a WAP. There where several problems to solve, because the WAP only has 8 Mb of RAM. This causes a lot of trouble with wl.o, because the driver needs -gt 1 Mb of RAM (unfragmented!) in order to load. Not to speak about a firmware upgrade using the mtd tool.</p><p>But: With the actual/old buildroot and some further space savings I&#039;ve seen this line in my dmesg today:</p><p>&quot;0b9a54 - 19fe54 linux&quot;.
