					<p>Recently I installed print server CUPS <a href="http://www.cups.org">http://www.cups.org</a>/ , followed this howto: <a href="http://blog.jameslick.com/?p=867">http://blog.jameslick.com/?p=867</a> . I followed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/PrinterSharingHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/PrinterSharingHowto</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto</a> . <br />USB stick is spool for CUPS. With fdisk I deleted partition and created new one, formated to ext3 and mounted as ext3 to /mnt.</p><p>The problem is since then router from time to time stop printing. I can login to router, I can connect to openVPN installed on router, but I can&#039;t login to CUPS console. Even more router don&#039;t respond to &#039;reboot&#039;. The only way is to plug out and in router. After that everything is ok until next &#039;crash&#039;.</p><p>I have no idea where to start from that. Where should I look and what is the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />how much jobs does your router have to manage at the same time?<br />I&#039;m using a Wl-500gx and havent had any probs yet so I do not think it is CPU-load which causes this.<br />(the gx has a weaker CPU and less Ram than the gP)<br />But I&#039;m using a 1Gb usb-stick. I read on this forum that one job can use more than 200mb while spooling.<br />Can you see if your usbstick is active during printing? Maybe it has a LED indicating traffic?</p><p>with best regards<br />p90</p>									</div>
