MR3020 is connected in client mode with main router with SSID &quot;NETGEAR10&quot;. My laptop is also connected to the same main router with SSID &quot;NETGEAR10&quot;. To SSH MR3020 I need to have connect it via ethernet to my Macbook. Once it is connected via lan then I am able SSH to the router but then ping 8.8.8.8 sows request time out but wifi signal sows full signal in wifi menu. <br />again when I remove ethernet from the laptop internet works perfectly. </p><p>netstat -rn output:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Routing tables

Missing part was default gateway entry. Just removed that default gateway entry (&#039;Router&quot; in macbook) which was 192.168.0.1 and everything is working smoothly. Million thanks @hackeritalics. You explained it really good. I would be great if you will explain why default gateway was causing problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>AH, I realized I kind of mis-spoke on the multiple gateway thing.. There are legitimate reasons why to have two or more, but those are mainly used in network equipement for redundancy and rely on a simple failover mechinism that rely&#039;s on being able to make TCP connections to the gateways. Since both of your gateways are &quot;up&quot; it is going to try one first and, if it can make a tcp connection, pass the request on essentially...</p>									</div>
