					<p>Hi</p><p>I have just bought an Asus WL500G Deluxe router and want to use it in combination with two pc&#039;s and a Sipura 2100.</p><p>On both the pc&#039;s I (well not at the same time) will be browsing, checking email and not least using bittorrent and I would like to be able to do all that (almost)without affecting the quality of my voip calls.</p><p>From what I can read in the forum the QOS in the asus firmware is not enough. </p><p>Can anyone provide my with a give me a cookbook telling me how to set this up. Firmware upgrade, scripts etc.</p><p>Has anyone with a setup like mine actually gotten qos to work ?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Anderton</p>									</div>

					<p>what do you mean by &#039;qos is not enough&#039;?</p><p>i think the important point for your network config is, that you will setup different ports for your p2p to let two machines behind a router connect..</p>									</div>

					<p>hi, yes, it is possible. I am using asus wl500g and I shaped p2P in such a way that it does not take too much bandwidth. My rules are not flexible though so it often happens that not all the bandwidth is used, but it was actually my aim since I am sharing it with some other people (I am on a wifi AP).</p><p>What you need to do: install openwrt (there is enough information in wiki, you can find some here: <a href="http://www.macsat.com">www.macsat.com</a> as well),&nbsp; get all posible upgrades for iptables (use package tracker and search the forums), load all modules you need, read something here: <a href="http://www.netfilter.org">www.netfilter.org</a> and here: <a href="http://www.lartc.org">www.lartc.org</a> and write your rules. That should be it:-).</p><p>Easier way: go here <a href="http://wl500g.info">http://wl500g.info</a>/, upload the newes Olegs firmware search for wondershaper - I do not know how effective it is, though.</p>									</div>
