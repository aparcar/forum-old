It was an experiment, both shiity, old and lot of bugs 3.10 kernel (mainline kernel for Mediatek SDK is 2.6.36) and openwrt build with this kernel. But this experimental openwrt build became popular suddenly (say thanks to small vendors who don&#039;t wanna make their own customized firmwares and use this crap for their products as a stock, yes, im talking about ZBT and other &quot;nonames&quot;)<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mkf.vip wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>and actually need just repeater option why it not supported??? do you have any suggestion</p></blockquote></div><p>cuz it use _proprietary_ driver as i said before<br />in a few words - it&#039;s faster, much better optimized and have more features than MT76, just cuz it written by guys who work in the same company as chip engineers</p><p>but</p><p>It completely have NO support of mac80211. So you can&#039;t configure it by usual openwrt way (by uci/luci) without special &quot;adapters&quot; as it made for proprietary broadcom drivers (wl) for example.</p><p>To &quot;adapt&quot; drivers it requires some special scripts which will translate uci settings to special config files used by driver and make some movements to up/down radios, additional apps (like sdk&#039;s &quot;apcli&quot; app to create a client connection) and special iwinfo driver to translate some driver data for openwrt enviroment.</p><p>Mediatek devs implemented AP mode only and very limited iwinfo support (no support, it works just as a generic WEXT and very few generic ioctls work actually), just cuz it was an experiment as i said before and it was enuff for devs to be proud they made sdk based &quot;openwrt&quot; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 1 Dec 2016, 23:15)</p>
