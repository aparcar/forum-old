					<p>I&#039;m trying to set up my openwrt router as a wireless client and run a server that would be visible to the rest of the network. I tried following this guide to set up a routed client (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a>) but when I got to the 2nd to the last step (Apply Changes) and entered `ifup wan` I got disconnected. Now when I try to connect (always with ethernet, obviously) my laptop hangs when it&#039;s getting an IP. The router connects to my wireless network, but I cant connect to the ssh or http server. nmap says its ports are filtered.</p><p>Is there any way to make this work, or a better way to set up a simple wireless client with a server?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>haigh</strong> on 26 Jul 2013, 05:12)</p>
