					<p>when i say locally i mean have an auth server that is on your local network.</p><p>My auth server is on 192.168.1.8 and my router is 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; Now i can get WifiDog to capture all internet traffic w/out a problem but when it tries to redirect the traffic, it gets all confused and instead of having 192.168.1.8 in m y web browser, it resolves to localhost.</p><p>The only thing i can think of trying is to have the wireless on a seperate network from the lan, but then i won&#039;t be able to reach the auth server if i am just connected via wireless...</p><p>So what am i supposed to do?</p>									</div>
