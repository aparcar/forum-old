					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m running OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment using the OpenVPN Package.<br />Well, i&#039;m trying to connect to a Mikrotik OpenVpn Instance. No Magic, but not working directly. Maybe someone can help me, please?</p><p>The Connection is being established, but fails on identifying the encryption alg. OpenVPN seems to choose a BF cipher. Mikrotik Device reports an &quot;unknown alg&quot; and disconnects the peer. With White Russian it would run, but for me, it is too old.</p><p>So I chose to give a try to the devel-package. The 2.3.0 Package using OpenSSL seems to run, but unfortunately it does not support loading credential-files.</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11982">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11982</a></p><p>I have absolutely no experience with building the package on my own (with needed option &quot;allow loading from file&quot;).&nbsp; What would you do?</p><p>best regards,</p><p>redflag237</p>									</div>

					<p>With OpenVPN, the encryption algorithms must match.
