					<p>You&#039;ll want to double-check that DNS works correctly both in the router and on your pc behind it. Assuming that both systems are able to resovle DNS correctly then the issue is going to be a firewall configuration. Try </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/firewall stop</code></pre></div><p>If that works then you&#039;ll need to take a look at the /etc/firewall.user file to configure the firewall.</p>									</div>
