					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m building my own v6 environment&nbsp; with OP CC. </p><p>My question is why the router shown on my MBP is the one starts with fe80::,&nbsp; &nbsp;instead of 2001::, which I got from HE.net.</p><p>I can&#039;t event ping this router, but I can browse the website, any every application just works fine. </p><p>I can&#039;t use nslookup -q=AAAA ipv6.google.com, wireshark show that the system doesn&#039;t even send out the DNS request. But&nbsp; nslookup -q=AAAA ipv6.google.com 2001::MY_ROUTER_v6_IP returns correct answer. </p><p>I know that these fe80:: addresses play important role in IPv6, anyone can tell me should I rewrite the router and DNS server which assign to my DHCP clients, or just leave them alone?<br />[img]s23.postimg.org/lfl8kp3vv/ipv6_router.jpg[/img]<br />Thanks,<br />Joey</p>									</div>
