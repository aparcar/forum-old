					<p>I have a set of python scripts to be used as an igate, which i like to distribute / install with Openwrt.<br />I have tried to create a makefile which does the job but i only get an error...</p><p>There are 3 python scripts, packaged into one tar.gz file<br />The idea is that the package installs the files in a directory (/etc/igate)<br />Next the files are made executable (chmod +x)<br />and finally the script is started using the screen utility followed by a number of commands....</p><p>Anyone any idea how to solve this issue ?</p><p>erik</p>									</div>
