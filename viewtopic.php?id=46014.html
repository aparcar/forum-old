					<p>Hi guys, I was wondering if I could get help unbricking my WR841ND without the use of serial. I was getting shitty wifi so I decided to try flashing stock firmware to see if it was the router. While flashing, I got up to grab my phone and in doing so I my foot hit the very loose extension cable. The router lost power momentarily and is not bricked. </p><p>The thread over here <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38953">here</a> produces explains how to unbrick a WR842ND without serial and I was hoping I could do the same with my 841ND. </p><p>I followed the thread and got to the Wireshark ARP part. It says to find an ARP request (Who has xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx? Tell xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx). After finding it I am supposed to change my IP to the one the router is looking for. Well everytime I try that the router starts to look for a different IP. Here is what it looks like: <span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Gipuwb1.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/Gipuwb1.png" /></span></p><p>It occurred to me that the thread says to look for Atheros in source and mine is Wistron so it might be very different.</p><p>Is what I am trying to do possible or should I just give up and go for a new router/attempt to fix this one using serial.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>P.S. If I do go for a new one should I go for the 843 or the 1043. I really enjoyed the 843 + OpenWRT so I want to either get that again or go for the 1043 which is on sale. Or is there another router with similar performance/price that I should get?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>elitewarrior101</strong> on 29 Aug 2013, 01:40)</p>

					<p>It would be a real shame to trash the WR841ND. It&#039;s a nice unit, and getting a serial connexion on that thing is easy..</p><p>The USB adapter is £1 on eBay. Then it&#039;s four screws, two minutes of soldering, a couple of crocodile clips and you&#039;re good to go.</p><p>If you have never tried connecting to a router over a serial connexion, I definitely recommend you try it. It&#039;s way more fun than it should be!</p><p>And if you still don&#039;t want to do it, at least give the unit to someone who will!</p><p>;o) Cor</p>									</div>
