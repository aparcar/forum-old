					<p>The latest version seems to break my TP Link TL-WDR4300 router as I was running ok with a release from a couple of weeks in the trunk but I wanted to add the qos-scripts into my build and the kernel changed from 3.0.18 to 3.0.24 and the modules were no longer compatible so I thought ok a simple upgrade like I had done previously.</p><p>When I restart or stop network I get the &quot;Command failed: Not found&quot; response like seen below.&nbsp; &nbsp; I was getting IPV6 DHCP addresses being assigned to my internal address and I disabled 6relayd which I think solved that but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m consistently getting DHCP working properly.&nbsp; &nbsp; I connected with wifi and then it would drop and complain about no internet and then a couple of minutes later reconnect but I think the wifi is broken as well too.</p><p>Help.&nbsp; &nbsp; I can only run trunk release on my two TL-WDR4300s so I want to get back to a more stable state...&nbsp; &nbsp; too bad there wasn&#039;t a snapshot back from a couple of weeks ago.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>BusyBox v1.19.4 (2013-12-17 22:42:52 MST) built-in shell (ash)
