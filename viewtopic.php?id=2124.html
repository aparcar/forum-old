					<p>another reason for som manny questions on teh same thing is that there is not answer offerd. </p><p>i have tried to find the answers on how to setup wondershaper and have seen lots of examples of code, but not where to put that code, what that code is and how it works (if you understand it then you know it, otherwise you are just copy-pasting and will return with more questions)</p><p>someone requested a how-to a while back and got some code, not a how-to.</p><p>if we got more answers we would probably have less questions</p>									</div>
