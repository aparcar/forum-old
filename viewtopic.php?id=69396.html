					<p>Hello,</p><p>I try to get a recent version of OpenWrt running on my cubietruck.</p><p>For Chaos Calmer, there seem to be&nbsp; the necessary drivers for Wifi missing, so I decided to build a binary from the trunk myself. </p><p>Build was successful, but Wifi is not being detected. </p><p>On top, I tried to follow the steps in the firmware.zip of the first post here:<br />forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=61459, no success!<br />Do I need additionaly the patch from here?<br />dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/sunxi/patches-3.14/232-1-dt-sun7i-add-wifi-to-cubietruck.patch?rev=42313<br />How would I do that?</p><p>Because I am not en expert and I am working kind of &quot;blind&quot; it is becoming a bit frustrating.</p><p>Because I want to use the cubietruck as a kind of travlling router/nas, I don&#039;t want to plug just another wifi adapter in.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p><p>Regards, Zappel.</p>									</div>
