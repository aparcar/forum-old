					<p>i want to share my experience in recover my bricked wrt54gl. As stupid as i was i tried to upgrade (downgrade) from kamikaze through xwrt2 with the result of a bricked router (blinking green light).<br />I spend most of the weekend trying different methods and finally i found a way to recover it.</p><p>1. power it down and open it up<br />2. ping 192.168.1.1 (from a terminal and let it run)<br />3. open your wrt54gl<br />4. shortcut pin 16 and 17.<br />5. put in the powercable and wait for ping respons. (If I rebooted my wrt54gl at this point i lost the ping.)</p><p>6 Connect directly through the internet and download&nbsp; openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin <br />7. Install linksys-tftp (check with your linuxdistro)<br />8. from a commandprompt run:<br />&nbsp; a. linksys-tftp<br />&nbsp; b. connect 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; c. bin<br />&nbsp; d. put openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin root:admin<br />(now it will upload the file and &quot;install&quot; it without reboot. saying something like: uploaded 1.9 mb in 2.5 sec. if you dont write root:admin it will say something like: not connected &quot;this i found out myself, creds to me&quot;)<br />&nbsp; e. after about 2 min. the blinking will stop and you get a constant green light. wait a while and then end the session. (if i rebooted at this point i lossed the ping)</p><p>9. telnet 192.168.1.1<br />10. passwd xxxxx (change passwd)<br />11. ssh 192.168.1.1 -l root<br />12. wget <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc6/bin/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussi â€¦ uashfs.trx</a> (i didnt get a wan respons so i put another router between wan and the wrt54gl and then i put the wrt54gl&#039;s ip-adress to dmz on that router, then i could download the file).<br />13. mtd -e linux -r write openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux (it installed normally and then the router rebooted.)</p><p>Now i had a fully working wrt54gl.</p>									</div>
