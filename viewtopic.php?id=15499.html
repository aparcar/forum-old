					<p>I&#039;m currently running Kamikaze 7.09 on my WRT54GL.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to get my wl0 interface up and running, but everywhere I read, I need to use wlc to do it.&nbsp; (For example, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam â€¦ figuration</a> and <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14760">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14760</a> both mention the need to install wlc).</p><p>But wlc didn&#039;t come with Kamikaze, and it&#039;s not in any of the ipkg lists.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure out anywhere how to install it.&nbsp; Any help on this?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I&#039;ve found a problem.&nbsp; My end goal here is to do packet injection with the WRT54GL using aircrack&#039;s tools.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read, Broadcom&#039;s drivers for Linux don&#039;t allow packet injection.&nbsp; So an effort is underway to create open source drivers for Linux 2.6 that allow Broadcom devices to inject packets. </p><p>My confusion seems to be:</p><p>* The Linux 2.4 Kamikaze is called brcm-2.4 (and this has wl and wcl in its ipkg lists)<br />* The Linux 2.6 Kamikaze is called brcm47xx-2.6/&nbsp; (this doesn&#039;t have wl or wcl in the ipkg lists)</p><p>The brcm-2.4 allows for wifi, but not packet injection.&nbsp; The brcm47xx-2.6 doesn&#039;t even have wifi working yet (best I can determine).</p><p>Further:</p><p>* The old deprecated open source driver is called bcm43xx.<br />* The new open source driver is called b43.&nbsp; (Both of these *should* allow packet injection, others have pulled it off).</p><p>Best I can tell, it seems other people are starting to get the b43 driver on Linux 2.6 with Broadcom devices to inject packets.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t seen anyone doing it with Kamikaze yet.&nbsp; Maybe if I knew a lot about compiling drivers and such, I could tackle it.&nbsp; For now, I&#039;ll probably just wait a few months and hope the problem gets solved in a cleaner way.</p><p>If I made a mistake or am missing something helpful, let me know.</p>									</div>
