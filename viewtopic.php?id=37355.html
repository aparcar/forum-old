					<p>Hello, I recently found a way to root my NVG510 U-Verse modem. This modem is notoriously known as being a really bad and buggy. I had an extra one laying around, so I opened it up, soldered some stuff to get to a serial port and had my first exercise in reverse-engineering. And I figured out how to fix nearly all of the problems with the modem as well, and got to a root shell. </p><p>When looking at the code for it&#039;s web user interface, I came across a huge security flaw that allows for rooting without opening the modem. </p><p>The modem uses a BCM6362 SoC, the same kind of &quot;series&quot; OpenWrt aims at. Some technical information(including GPL source links) can be found here: <a href="http://www.wikidevi.com/wiki/Motorola_NVG510">http://www.wikidevi.com/wiki/Motorola_NVG510</a></p><p>I&#039;ve documented all that I&#039;ve found out so far. <br />The solder-free web vulnerability method to get to a root shell can be found here: <a href="http://lastyearswishes.com/blog/view/4fcff51b4aa5d8385420c706">http://lastyearswishes.com/blog/view/4f … 385420c706</a><br />And more information about it&#039;s configuration and opening-it-up method can be found here: <a href="http://lastyearswishes.com/blog/view/4fcc69bc4aa5d8385420c705">http://lastyearswishes.com/blog/view/4f … 385420c705</a></p><p>I would really love if there was an alternate OS for this modem, though I&#039;m not for sure it&#039;s possible. It seems to be a complete other beast from what OpenWrt usually tackles. This is a modem that can&#039;t have an equivalent of PPPoE because there is no &quot;username&quot; or &quot;password&quot; to send. </p><p>Anyway, I just thought I would enlighten the community to this development. I know I&#039;ve seen quite a few people having trouble getting the NVG510 to bridge to OpenWrt routers. While it&#039;d be awesome to see a port of OpenWrt to the NVG510, I&#039;ll settle with just providing the community with a &quot;true&quot; bridge mode for the router detailed in my two blog posts. </p><p>If anyone has any questions or anything to test, I have an extra NVG510 that I can test experiments on</p><p>Note: Most U-Verse customers are forced to use the NVG510. There is no option for another modem. I&#039;m sure a stable port would receive a lot of attention</p>									</div>
