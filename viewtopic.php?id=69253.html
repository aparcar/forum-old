					<p>On a Debian testing amd64 system I tried to build a TEW732BR image using the Image Builder scripts (trunk, CC) and compiling with the latest git sources.&nbsp; Both scripts started but failed to complete.&nbsp; I googled the error messages and did not get a quick fix.</p><p>Are there any known issues with Debian Stretch?&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to install Debian Jessie or try to trouble shoot building on Stretch with some guidance.&nbsp; Or should I just install the latest CC release and add vnstat/mailsend-nossl as packages?</p><p>The other issue is that the TEW732BR factory firmware is a 8mb flash image with a Trendnet signature in the file footer.&nbsp; There are several 4mb flash images for other routers that use the same chipset (TL842nd version2.x/DIR615 version I3)&nbsp; Is it possible to pad these 4mb images to 8mb and add the Trendnet signature with a binary editor?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 6 Jan 2017, 21:00)</p>
