					<p>The firmware image files created by hostle19 are very much appreciated as he put efforts to include Luci in the image.

OpenWrt wiki <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obta … e.generate</a> explains very well how to do so. This page <a href="http://www.andrewklau.com/generating-my-own-openwrt-custom-firmware/">http://www.andrewklau.com/generating-my … -firmware/</a> was also helpful.</p><p>I removed the ppp and pppoe packages since it is an AP and added luci module in the image using the following command.</p><p>make image PROFILE=TLWA901 PACKAGES=&quot;luci&quot;</p><p>Thank you, wonderful people of OpenWrt community.</p><p>DJ</p>									</div>
