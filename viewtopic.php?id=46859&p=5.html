					<p>Can we use latest firmware (not trunk) from this link:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa850re-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br … pgrade.bin</a><br />Does it have web gui and what is the difference from the one on first page?</p><p>Maybe a stupid question but i&#039;m still new to all this. I&#039;m currently using it only as wifi ap for my mikrotik so it doesnt have enabled any extra feature (dhcp is eaven dissabled). Bought it really cheap and want to replace my tp link 741nd with this little device. Currently it is working ok but i had to reset it few times because it wasnt working (wifi sometimes stops responding), so maybe new version fixed smething?</p><p>---</p><p>Nevermind, I updated to latest version and its working just fine now, but still cant manage to get full speed on wifi (most of my devices connect at 65Mbit/s) Is there any way to enable full potential (300Mbit/s) ant theres a little bug, in wifi settings it always changes password to the one I set for login password so everytime I want to change something and save I have to retype my pass. And theres no more B mode for wifi only G&amp;N (but since I dont need it i wount complain <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ). Other than that its working just fine!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>viktorx</strong> on 19 Nov 2014, 13:38)</p>

					<p>So I downloaded and got openwrt working on a wa750 but now because i downloaded one without luci by acident i can&#039;t use gui to set it up. Due to this it is very hard to try to update with new firmware to add luci on os x. I can not get it to accept tftp.(using command line, and tftpserver application) I did enable wifi and am able to connect but since the only eth port on it is lan it does me no good. I do have access to android tablets if that helps other then that only os x. Is there a telnet/ssh command to change the port to wan? What would you guys do? Maybe scp and then sysupdate but i can&#039;t get it to accept scp. A command line for connecting to existing wifi would probably solve the issue to right? Since then i could just use wget right? I don&#039;t know that why i came here. Thanks in advance for any help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vortell</strong> on 19 Jan 2015, 05:39)</p>

					<p>Thanks ofutur for the getting started post, finding it helpful for a beginner to get started.!</p><p>I&#039;m working via the GUI, since I&#039;m a little lost via ssh/terminal commands, although willing to learn.</p><p>I&#039;ve installed Chaos Calmer via the TP-LINK GUI and connected via LAN.

					<p>Hi everyone, currently TP link is shipping the V2 version of the WA850RE. This one at least looks identical to the previous version, but it does not accept the current openWRT builds, the firmware upgrade page gives a checksum error.
