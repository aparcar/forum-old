					<p>I have acquired one of these and am trying to to install OpenWrt so I can use it in Client mode.</p><p>The hardware is 4 x 100Mb Eth ports, 1 ADSL, 2 Buttons, 1 Power and a Secure Easy Setup Button.</p><p>CPU is a BCM96348 with BCM4318 Wifi&nbsp; and a BCM2535 switch. 1 x 4Mbx8 Flash and 2 x 8Mb Ram chips.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen similar setups listed in the hardware database, so It should be useable, and I can telnet to the unit and access the Linux system there, but I can&#039;t get the router to accept any OpenWrt firmware.</p><p>I have found a webpage that lists the jumpers, and my next attempt will be to connect a serial console, and see if I can update via CFE, unless anyone can suggest anything else.</p><p>Thanks<br/>Darren</p>									</div>

					<p>Success!</p><p>I tried to flash this by the using the holding the reset button in for 30 seconds trick, but that only gave me the Linksys firmware pages, so I attached a serial lead to j503 on the board and used the CFE &#039;flashimage&#039; command to install openwrt.</p><p>I chose &#039;openwrt-96348GW-generic-squashfs-cfe.bin&#039; (from 10.03.1) as the image to flash, and it seems to be working fine, (except the ADSL which I don&#039;t need)<br/>I have reconfigured it via LuCI as a WiFi client&lt;-&gt;ethernet bridge (Which is the intended use for the device).</p><p>There is a button on the front I&#039;m not sure how to configure, but I can&#039;t think of a use for that currently.</p><p>This device is not listed on the hardware database (and is listed as unsupported in the old database) </p><p>Regards<br/>Darren</p>									</div>
