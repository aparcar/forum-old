					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve been running Tomato on an Asus RT-N16 for years but Tomato is no longer being developed and I&#039;d like to move to a newer open source router firmware that has a more active development community. OpenWrt looks interesting but I&#039;d like to find something that&#039;s easy to use like Tomato was it - basically download the firmware image, flash the router, and your done - you can hit it with a browser and use/configure it immediately. Tomato was as easy to use as OEM firmware. I take it from what I&#039;ve read so far, OpenWrt is more of a build-it-yourself thing where you need to spend a lot of time using ssh doing command line stuff, which is definitely not something I want to deal with. But I read in some posts hints that an easy-to-use web GUI exists and that in some cases a ready-to-install downloadable firmware file can be gotten for a few lucky types of hardware. I&#039;ve not had any luck tracking down anything more specific though. I have seen the hardware list in the wiki but it doesn&#039;t seem to address the availability of read-to-use firmware. So I guess this is leading up to a couple of questions:</p><p>1. Is there really some version of OpenWrt firmware that comes with a web GUI in a Tomato-like easy to use, download, flash, and run type package? </p><p>2. If the answer to #1 is yes, is such a package available for my existing Asus RT-N16?</p><p>3. If the answer to #2 is no, can someone recommend a specific router I could buy for which such a version of OpenWrt is available?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>steevithak</strong> on 11 Feb 2016, 21:16)</p>

					<p>You have two main GUIs for OpenWRT, the default, advenced one called Luci and a simpler version called Gargoyle.</p><p>The latest stable version of OpenWRT with Luci for your router can be found here:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/brcm47xx/mips74k/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calm … x/mips74k/</a></p><p>For Gargoyle, you don&#039;t have a special build, just a generic one built for the platform Asus uses:<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/downloads/images/brcm47xx/gargoyle_1.9.0-brcm47xx-generic-squashfs.trx">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/download … uashfs.trx</a></p><p>Which might work, but... I would ask at their forums first before trying to install this.</p><p>You can flash a new firmware from Tomato, just use a cable, don&#039;t do it ower wifi.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>boolsheat</strong> on 11 Feb 2016, 21:20)</p>

					<p>Thanks! That&#039;s helpful. I googled screenshots of Luci and Gargoyle. I realized I was already familiar with Luci, it seems to be the interface running on my AntMiner boxes. Who knew. Overall though, Gargoyle looks much more intuitive and useful as a router interface (and it looks more like Tomato). Since it&#039;s not available for my hardware, though, I&#039;m going to start with the Luci firmware you provided the link for and see how that goes. If I don&#039;t like it, I can always buy another type of router that&#039;s more compatible with Gargoyle.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi I dont no if Gargoyle will run on your router but if you ever get your hands on a c7 deffo chek out Gargoyle. It&#039;s really good for QOS and stopping the kids from getting on to those naughty sites lol I have to lads in there teans and i have to run opendns and a adblock plugin that blocks some of the porn sites too. I am a mod on the Gargoyle forum so if you want any help with settings then just hit me up.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, that&#039;s two recommendations for the TL-Link / Archer C7. Anyone know how I can buy one? I checked Amazon but based on the review comments, they are currently selling the v3 models which won&#039;t work. Is there some place I can buy the v2 model?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have run openwrt on 2 TP link routers and it has worked great. (http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr740n, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3500).">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3500).</a> I just ordered a TL-WDR4300 as my wdr3500 finally died after 2+ years in 24/7 use.<br />Depending on your needs the C7 may be overkill. I peruse the table of hardware to get an idea for current users who have had good experiences with latest versions of openwrt on a particular router: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a></p>									</div>
