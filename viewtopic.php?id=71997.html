					<p>Hi everybody!</p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 on my Dlink router, and all works ok except for something wrong with IPv6...</p><p>I&#039;ve got a FTTH connection with FastWeb here in Italy, and the connection and the optic fiber modem is correctly working in IPv6: if I connect my PC directly to the fiber optic modem, all the v6 stack works perfectly and I can connect to IPv6 services and test-ipv6.com returns 10/10.</p><p>But... if I connect my PC to the OpenWrt router, nothing seems to work ok with v6!</p><p>The router in its status page tells me that it has a v6 address, and is connected to the internet also via v6, and that has assigned to my pc a DHCPv6 address, but the pc doesn&#039;t seem to care: test-ipv6 doesn&#039;t find a v6 address, and it seems that my pc hasn&#039;t got v6 at all...</p><p>What I&#039;m missing here?</p><p>Thanks to everybody!</p>									</div>
