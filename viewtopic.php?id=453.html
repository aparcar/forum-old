					<p>...of course I had to try it, after all.</p><p>Turns out that the Linksys version of the kernel is already patched with ebtables. The only thing missing from openwrt is the modules from <strong>buildroot/build_mipsel/WRT54GS/release/src/linux/linux/net/bridge/netfilter</strong> and the userspace tool that you get from the ebtables sourceforge page (you&#039;ll have to cross-compile it for mipsel, of course). You also need to install <strong>/etc/ethertypes</strong> from the <em>ebtables</em> package.</p><p>Now, this does work. The only problem is that the Linux kernel isn&#039;t actually bridging traffic on the WLAN, and it doesn&#039;t bridge the traffic on the switch ports, either. So this only has an effect on traffic <em>between</em> the WLAN and the switch ports. (someone please correct me if this is wrong - it seems reasonable and it seems to work that way when i test it)</p><p>You can of course split the switch into four separate interfaces and do software bridging between all the ports (right, someone?), but that will still not help you with traffic between WLAN clients.</p><p>/Hans</p>									</div>

					<p>So what does wl0_ap_isolate control, exactly?&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s telling the new driver to behave a certain way.&nbsp; So this feature happens at the radio firmware level?&nbsp; It&#039;s not part of 802.11b or Linux?&nbsp; So AP Isolation is controlling the Ethernet (Link) layer somehow?<br />I&#039;m interested in this because it would make using Frottle a lot easier - all clients associated to a Frottle-controlled AP need to send their data via that AP (actually, the router or PC connected to the AP).&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested to see if this AP_Isolation feature could be enabled on the wired ethernet ports - probably not I&#039;m thinking, but worth pondering. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>For the wired ports, you only need to use admcfg to add each port to a different vlan, but the problem is that then all the local traffic would go trough the processor, and the communication will get sloooowww (not sure how slow, maybe it isn&#039;t that much), but you will be able to filter traffic on wired.</p><p>For the wireless, the only thing I can come out is: VPN, create a VPN link for each wireless client, and then you can isolate them as you wich.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe using different networks for each client, and then use iptables.&nbsp; Off course, if one of your clients have airsnort, he could pick a IP from other network, and/or spy other clients, but I think it is better than nothing.</p>									</div>
