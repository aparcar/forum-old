					<p>Hi guys, i have downloaded a trunk image of openwrt to mr3420 v2 in 29/06/2016 and this image has 396k of free space in /overlay. Then installed kmod-usb-storage, kmod-fs-ext4 and block-mount packages. So I had a extroot.</p><p>But now when I try to install any packages i have a error about kernel version. So I think this version is descontinued. </p><p>I have downloaded the image of 19/07/2016 but this version have about 200k-300k, so this space is insufficient to install that packages to have a extroot.</p><p>So, anyone have or know some image of Chaos Calmer 15.05 that have this space free in overlay?</p><p>Sorry about my english <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p>									</div>
