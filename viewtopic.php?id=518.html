They are slowly uploading the source for each model. For the first time, only the B49G&#039;s firmware was up, then they are added the BR404W&#039;s. For the B46B, it should be a bit harder, as Realtek made everyone&#039;s life difficult.. You can read more about that on rtl8181.sf.net.<br/>Anyway, asking about the source won&#039;t hurt, IMHO.</p>									</div>
