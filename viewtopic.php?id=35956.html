					<p>here is a question hopefully someone can answer. I have 3 routers each with it&#039;s own internet/DSL in different areas.</p><p>right now i use the netgear firmware with static routes pointing to the lan router, windows server 2008r2 using RIP, inteface ip address that is connected in-between all 3 doing the routing. (just to note this same setup does NOT work with the openwrt backfire version</p><p>If this can be done using VLANS for the router to router and use RIP routing or something else that would be preferred. What iI would like is to have all the routing to be done in the wndr3700&#039;s over the switch ports?</p><p>The subnets IP ranges i use is 192.168.1.0 192.168.2.0 192.168.3.0, I can not use the WAN ports are they are used for DSL.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wesleyhey</strong> on 11 Apr 2012, 17:31)</p>
