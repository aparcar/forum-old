					<p>I&#039;d like to wake-on-lan from wan, but can&#039;t seem to get it working. It works from lan, ie. from my laptop, where I&#039;ve set MAC to the mac address of the sleeping computer, I can do<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ wol $MAC</code></pre></div><p>and it starts up. It also starts up with the broadcast IP specified, like so:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ wol -i 192.168.1.255 $MAC</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve tried translating the DD-WRT tutorial at <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WOL#Remote_Wake_On_LAN_via_Port_Forwarding">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/WO â€¦ Forwarding</a> into OpenWRT terms. I added the following firewall redirects in luci:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> UDP wan:0.0.0.0/0:* Device:0.0.0.0/0:9 lan:192.168.1.254:9 DNAT 
 UDP wan:0.0.0.0/0:* Device:0.0.0.0/0:7 lan:192.168.1.254:7 DNAT</code></pre></div><p>and used the following /etc/rc.local:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Put your custom commands here that should be executed once
# the system init finished. By default this file does nothing.

ip neigh change 192.168.1.254 lladdr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff nud permanent dev br-lan
ip neigh add 192.168.1.254 lladdr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff nud permanent dev br-lan

exit 0</code></pre></div><p>After installing the ip package so those commands would work, and rebooting, the command &quot;arp&quot; shows a new entry<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>192.168.1.254    0x1         0x6         ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     *        br-lan</code></pre></div><p>so it seems the ip commands did work. But still wake-on-lan does not.</p><p>Anyone have a clue how to fix/debug this?</p><p>Running&nbsp; Backfire (10.03.1-RC5, r27608) on a Netgear WNDR3700v2, if it matters.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>unhammer</strong> on 11 Dec 2011, 16:10)</p>

					<p>ok, this has been bugging me for a while since i thought i had it all figured out with just forwarding the right port to the right ip address...not so much. but finally got it working flawlessly, thanks mainly to this thread.</p><p>here&#039;s a summary of how i got my setup to work since it&#039;s a bit different than what unhammer had to do and this thread kinda died without a conclusion:</p><p><strong>1. set up your firewall forwarding</strong><br />forward UDP port 9 (or 7) from the any wan ip to the lan ip 192.168.1.254 (modify this to be a permanently unused ip in your local subnet but not the standard broadcast ip ending .255)<br /><strong>2. define your new broadcast ip in the iptables</strong><br />add to your startup script (before &quot;exit 0&quot; and after comments) the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip neigh add 192.168.1.254 lladdr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff nud permanent dev br-lan</code></pre></div><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this command needs to be used verbatim and it uses the ip package which wasn&#039;t installed initially in the 12.09-rc1 build i am running. use the system&gt;software tab to install the package named simply &quot;ip&quot; (nothing more, nothing less).<br /><strong>3. Reboot and enjoy</strong></p><p>These 3 (possibly 4) steps simply define a new ip address for your router to forward packets that i intended for network-wide broadcast, this is done to circumvent a the standard limitation of not forwarding packets to the standard broadcast address. The ff-filled mac address is the special identifier for ALL hardware, that&#039;s why it is used in the ip command. (this is how i understand it, someone please correct me if i&#039;m wrong.)</p><p>hope this helps the next person to find this thread.<br />thanks guys.</p>									</div>
