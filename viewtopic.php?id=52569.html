					<p>Hi all. I really need some help here guys. I&#039;m pulling my hairs out here.<br />I have 2 OpenWRT (barrier-breaker) devices. WDR3600 (Main Router), and WA901ND (Subrouter), both tp-link with Atheros chipset. I have set up the Main Router so that IPTV works when I connect my set top box to Port 5. However, I want to connect my set top box to my Main Router wirelessly.</p><p>My Main Router Setup:<br />WAN interface: PPPoE to VLAN 500.<br />LAN interface: Static address, bridging eth0, VLAN100, and WiFi.<br />Switch0: Port1 (WAN) tagged with VLAN500 &amp; 600, off with VLAN100.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Port2-4 untagged with 100, off with 500 &amp; 600.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Port 5 untagged VLAN600, off with 100 &amp; 500.</p><p>In trying to set up wireless IPTV, I created another interface (IPTV), with an unmanaged protocol, bridging VLAN600 and WiFi_TV (different SSID from the normal WiFi). However, when I connect the set top box it doesn&#039;t work. The self-check gives me:<br />Network connection: OK<br />Obtaining IP address: OK<br />Gateway connectivity: OK<br />Central connectivity: OK<br />NTP connectivity: OK<br />DNS connectivity: OK<br />Multicast connectivity: FAILED</p><p>I&#039;ve also tried to use my Subrouter as a wireless transparent bridge, and wire the set top box to the Subrouter. I get exactly the same result.<br />Does anybody have any idea what the problem is here?<br />UPDATE<br />I&#039;ve read on a forum that my ISP checks the log in account details against the MAC address before it allows IPTV service. Maybe that has sth to do with it?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Djalaal</strong> on 4 Sep 2014, 09:23)</p>

					<p>Have you tried to run tcpdump on your main router (VLAN600 interface)? Two questions:</p><p>- What IP address does the STB get? One from your ISP, or something else?<br />- What MAC address does this resolve to on the main router? (type <strong>arp</strong>, if it uses IPv6 you need to install ip utility and run <strong>ip neigh show</strong>).</p><p>I&#039;d like to see /etc/config/network from both devices, because I wouldn&#039;t expect your setup to work (bridge traffic over WiFi_TV). If the main router is an AP with Wifi_TV SSID and the WA901ND is a STA (client) connecting to it, you normally need relayd or something else to get things going. I&#039;m guessing your problem is that the MAC address isn&#039;t passed across the bridge, but is translated to the WA901NDs address instead. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mesh.batman">Batman-adv</a> should be able to let you create a bridge without translating MAC addresses.</p><p>Edit: You actually didn&#039;t say what kind of wireless interface Wifi_TV is, if it&#039;s ad-hoc it might work, I just guessed AP+STA. Either way, if you want to set up batman-adv, you should create ad-hoc interfaces for Wifi_TV.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 4 Sep 2014, 12:02)</p>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. Well, being really quite new to all this networking and routing &#039;magic&#039;, I can&#039;t really figure out what command to run on putty to get a tcpdump? Also, I might be asking stupid questions, so brace yourself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />.</p><p>The IP address, the active DNS IP address, the gateway address on the STB are all from my ISP, not my local network. It uses a different subnet mask too.<br />arp showed me all my devices connected to the main router EXCEPT the stb. When I look at the GUI, I see the STB is connected (the WiFi MAC address of the STB is shown) to WiFi_TV, but the IPv4-Address has a &#039;?&#039;. I always wondered what is up with that.</p><p>Following a OpenWRT guide of creating a transparent wireless bridge, I made the Main Router the AP (WDS) and the Subrouter Client (WDS). Does that make a difference? However, when connecting directly via WiFi (without bridge), I use normal AP mode.</p><p>I don&#039;t know how to copy the text from putty to my PC so i made a screenshot... I cannot give the Subrouter one yet, it is N/A atm.</p><p><a href="http://img42.com/2pJt7+">http://img42.com/2pJt7+</a><br /><a href="http://img42.com/CI0Yp+">http://img42.com/CI0Yp+</a><br />(I hope the links work.

					<p>Oh, I didn&#039;t think of WDS. But if your STB gets the correct IP address it would seem that your wireless works as it should. What you&#039;re missing is multicast, and you can look up <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/udp_multicast">multicast on wiki</a> for that. I don&#039;t have any experience with this, but note that the article expects to have multicast traffic on the br-lan interface, which means you will have to adapt it somewhat.</p><p>By the way, to copy text from Putty, just highlight it, and paste it wherever you like. Although with WDS it makes sense that it works, so no need for more files at the moment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 4 Sep 2014, 13:29)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the OpenWRT link to multicasting. I&#039;ll give it a try tomorrow. I&#039;ll update post when I did so. If this doesn&#039;t work, I might have to opt for homeplugs...</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe you makro, or someone else can guide me a little here. <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/udp_multicast">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/udp_multicast</a> gives me a guide on how to set up multicast support for IPTV. I believe this could be my solution. It is my last resort anyway. Since I want it over WiFi, the guide tells me I need to set up udpxy to stream UDP multicast over TCP.</p><p>The problem is that it gives me a bash script. I don&#039;t know what to do with it... I looked into the file it refers to (/etc/rc.common), and it already contains a long piece of text. It is a similar looking bash script as well. Am I suppose to replace the whole file with this new one, or append it, or integrate it somehow?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Djalaal</strong> on 5 Sep 2014, 18:23)</p>
