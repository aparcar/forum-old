					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a solution, and can&#039;t really figure it out, how to make this happen.</p><p>Trying to get access point functionality here with two SSIDs. One bridged and one with NAT addresses, both connected to the LAN interface.</p><p>The purpose is that the translated (NAT) address space will be a kind of guest-net. And the reason is that I&#039;m running out of addresses for the LAN-network. Only employees will connect to the bridged SSID and guest only to the translated.</p><p>Is there a howto for the above? If not I&#039;ll make one here when I get it working :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Ahm...</p><p>1-) Do you want the guest network acessing something on the &quot;private&quot; network?<br />If not, just create a new wifi network (network, wifi, add), assign it to a &quot;guest&quot; firewall zone (when creating the wifi network, under &quot;interface configuration&quot;, &quot;network&quot;, checkbox &quot;create&quot; and give it a name... &quot;guest&quot;) and configure the firewall (network, firewall) to forward requests from the wifi guest zone to wan (click the &quot;edit&quot; on the guest zone you&#039;ve just created, under &quot;inter-zone forwarding&quot;, &quot;allow forward to destination zones&quot; check &quot;wan&quot;)</p><p>2-) Running out of addresses?<br />-what subnet mask you use? 255.255.255.0?<br />-how many addresses do you need?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>1) Sorry, missed that part of the information. Yes the guest network (translated) needs to be able to access services on the LAN as http, cifs.</p><p>2) I&#039;ve got 130.x.x.y/24 available. And a lot of students and teachers with iProducts, Androids and wifi-laptops :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>This are public IPs? I mean, they&#039;re a private network (that you can change the subnet mask) or they&#039;re public (internet) network?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>digital</strong> on 30 Apr 2013, 18:39)</p>
