Before I had some firewall rules on my Synology to only accept connections from 192.168.1.0/24 to 192.168.4.0/24. Now with OpenVPN I get 10.1.1.0/24...so...yes...that stupid...</p><p>The odd thing was, that I was able to access my NAS through the phone&#039;s browser or Synology&#039;s own apps, while connected through VPN, but not by using &quot;ES file browser&quot; or &quot;Total Commander&quot;. Currently, I don&#039;t trust my setup, but then again, too many changes in an uncontrolled manner. Hence, I am redoing everything.&nbsp; :-)</p><br /><p><strong>Update &amp; Feedback</strong><br />@JW0914: First of all a big <strong> THANK YOU!</strong> for your great work and kind &amp; patient support!!</p><p>I spent a couple of hours yesterday because in my attempt to get my router back into a clean state, I bricked it and needed some time to get it back working again. Flashing Linksys&#039; stock firmware did not work for me at all, but I am pretty sure it&#039;s a handling issue on my end...</p><p>Anyways, <strong>I followed your tutorial. In short: It works for me with a minor modification.</strong></p><p>In my Android openvpn.ovpn file I had to remove<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>&lt;tls-auth&gt;
-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----
 
-----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----
&lt;/tls-auth&gt;</code></pre></div><p>and replace it with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tls-auth ta.key 1</code></pre></div><p>No other change was needed (neither certificates nor &quot;option tls_server &#039;1&#039;&quot;).</p><p>Personally, I would appreciate a little more detail in the section <strong>Create SSL Certificates</strong>. It is also somewhat misleading as the tutorial states</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>It is highly recommended to add a complex password to your Certificate Authority (CA)
Failure to set any password allows anyone who gains access to your Certificate Authority the ability to create client certificates.</code></pre></div><p>but when I did a <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>build-ca</code></pre></div><p>I couldn&#039;t set a password. Only for the others, where partly it is indicated to not set one.</p><p>This section is confusing to me and I am a bit unsure whether my certificates are now created the &quot;proper&quot; way or not.</p><p>Other than that the tutorial is just awesome and makes the process to setup a VPN-server so much easier. The only thing left for me is to get all traffic routed through the OpenVPN server...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gaga</strong> on 14 Jul 2015, 13:03)</p>
