					<p>Previously, my ADSL was connected via a Billion modem/router, which was then connected by ethernet to an Archer C7 running OpenWRT, for wifi connections. The Billion modem/router did DHCP, and the OpenWRT Archer C7 router had DHCP disabled. On the latter, all ethernet cables (including the one leading to the modem) connected to the LAN ports. The WAN port was empty.</p><p>I&#039;ve since changed modem/routers, to a cheap TP-Link. Hence, I wanted the OpenWRT Archer C7 router to do DHCP, so I re-enabled this in OpenWRT. I put the cheap modem/router into &quot;DHCP relay&quot; mode, which seemed to work. I left the modem/router connected to the LAN port, with the WAN port empty. (Is that correct? I don&#039;t really understand what the rationale is behind this.)</p><p>I&#039;m now trying to set up port forwarding on my OpenWRT Archer C7. Is it possible to do this from LAN to LAN, preferably via the GUI? I&#039;ve tried Network &gt; Firewall &gt; Port Forwards, setting the following</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Match:
IPv4-TCP, UDP
From any host in lan
Via any router IP

Forwards to:
IP 192.168.1.91, port 80 in lan</code></pre></div><p>However, this didn&#039;t seem to work. I&#039;m unsure if this is important, but the drop-down menu where I select the Internal IP address has a few addresses to select from, but <em>not</em> 192.168.1.91, which is the one I want. I have to type it in manually. FWIW I *can* connect to this internal IP address by ssh perfectly. Also, if important, this server is connected via ethernet, although the selectable addresses are both connected via wifi and ethernet.</p><p>I also tried changing ports to 80 for the host and router, both together and singularly. I&#039;ve also tested Network &gt; Firewall &gt; Traffic rules &gt; New forward rule, with similar settings, but this also seems to fail.</p><p>Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.18.20</p>									</div>

I very much appreciate it. This indeed seems to make the most sense.</p><p>I set the modem/router to bridge mode, connected it to the WAN port, then in the OpenWRT GUI, set up the PPPoE connection over WAN. Now the OpenWRT router itself has internet access; I can ping from Network &gt; Diagnostics. I can also obviously connect to the OpenWRT router from my computer, over wifi/LAN. However, none of the connected computers have internet access. I&#039;m not sure what settings are relevant, but I assume that my LAN settings are incorrect. Here are some relevant lines from /etc/config/network (but I&#039;d prefer to use the GUI to fix it if possible).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
    option force_link &#039;1&#039;

    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
    option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.100&#039;

config interface &#039;wan&#039;
    option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;
    option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0&#039;

    option proto &#039;pppoe&#039;
    option username &#039;foo&#039;
    option password &#039;bar&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Finally, I&#039;m not sure if relevant, but when my modem/router is connected via WAN as above, I can&#039;t seem to access it through its web interface. I read the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/access.modem.through.nat">wiki</a>, but the &quot;IP Aliases&quot; section was missing from OpenWRT&#039;s GUI.</p>									</div>

Again, clients can connect fine to each other, and appear to have an IP address.</p><p>However, I noticed something odd. From a clean install, I set up WAN, then restart the router. My computer is connected to the router via ethernet, and I can immediately connect to the internet. I can also ssh to my home server, but <em>this</em> cannot connect to the internet.</p><p>I then configure the wifi antennae. Devices in my house start connecting immediately. At this point, my ethernet-connected computer fails to connect to the internet again. I wonder if the router is only allowing one thing to connect at a time???</p><p>#EDIT<br />More things that I&#039;ve tried and didn&#039;t work:<br />* Putting masquerade to the LAN config in the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59543">firewall</a>.<br />* Totally disabling firewall: System &gt; Startup &gt; Firewall &gt; Disabled; then restarting.<br />&nbsp; * I restarted twice after this, and it actually prevented me from connecting to the internet at all.<br />* I <a href="http://superuser.com/a/697090/125959">checked</a>, and IP forwarding was already enabled.</p><p>#EDIT2<br />Aaaaaaaand some of my devices were set to a static IP, and I forgot to change the gateway to the new router. Correcting this fixes everything. The ethernet on my computer was <em>not</em> set to a static IP, which explains why it worked, but I&#039;m not sure why it <em>didn&#039;t</em> work at various points. Anyway, it&#039;s all fixed now, and the port forwarding works fine too. It only ended up taking me 3 hours before my first post, and 5 hours after! Thank you so much for your help; I&#039;m very happy now!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Pseudorellia</strong> on 8 Dec 2016, 06:38)</p>

However, it&#039;s so straightforward in OpenWRT! I don&#039;t really have portability issues, but it&#039;s so much simpler and easy to manage centrally. (I use static IPs for my laptop and four Raspberry Pis, so this is so much easier.) Thanks for the advice!</p>									</div>

					<p>Another benefit is that you can put friendly DNS hostnames. So no more need to use numbers for connecting to LAN devices. You can just use, for example:</p><p>ping laptop1.lan</p><p>(assuming your internal DNS suffix is set to &#039;lan&#039;)</p>									</div>
