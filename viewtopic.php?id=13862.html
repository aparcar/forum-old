					<p>I don&#039;t see why installing asterisk14 spawns libncurses installation using xwrt&#039;s repo, but you could try to remove x-wrt repository from ipkg before installing asterisk, that might help you.<br />Otherwise, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a trailing slash problem as it has absolutely no effect if you use multiple slash to refer to a path. (try cd ////etc///// it won&#039;t matter).</p><p>The problem seems to arise because of the acces rights on /mnt/usb1/. <br />You can try removing x-wrt&#039;s repo from ipkg config, then install Asterisk using hans.zandbelt&#039;s repo, then check the acces rights of the directory which caused you problems, and before even adding x-wrt&#039;s repo to ipkg try starting asterisk.<br />Then, if it works and the acces rights seems Ok to you, you can add x-wrt&#039;s repo to install webif^2.</p><p>Also please check that you&#039;ve correctly followed step 5 &quot;5. Modifying Your Environment&quot; on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/PackagesOnExternalMediaHowTo">http://wiki.openwrt.org/PackagesOnExternalMediaHowTo</a></p><p>And finally if nothing works, you&#039;ve got the names of the symlinks ipkg tried to create, you can try for yourself using ln -s (try finding a manual page of ln online) and see what the problem might be.</p><p>Good luck.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok great, I might update the wiki to migrate to Kamikaze when I have the time (or when whiterussian&#039;s asterisks packages way outdated).<br />You can still follow asterisk&#039;s configuration steps from the wiki, as they aren&#039;t linked to your OpenWRT distro, let me know if you have any trouble or if you find any inconsistencies in the wiki.</p>									</div>

					<p>Some of my problems (regarding the config path) were solved by creating a symbolic link in /etc/ to /mnt/usb/etc/asterisk/, I didn&#039;t mention it in the wiki as I thought that it could be fixed in another way and that it was a glitch following my tests.<br />I also think that the startup script of asterisk created in /mnt/sd/etc/init.d/ has a problem with the OPTIONS variable, which overrides the one loaded by sourcing DEFAULT (see /mnt/sd/etc/default/asterisk), to fix that I&#039;ve had to comment out the line OPTIONS=&quot;&quot; in the startup script which was overriding the one in default, this will help asterisk find your -C ...<br />But there&#039;s more than one way to do it, it sure is nice that you did find some workaround.</p><p>Now I have to find out why astdb is always reset when the router shuts down. Maybe /var/spool isn&#039;t a good place to keep it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ouaibe</strong> on 29 Jan 2008, 02:51)</p>

					<p>@PsychoMantis: There&#039;s already a startup script for asterisk, you can just modify the automatic startup script installed with webif^2 (S95-custom... something) or go through the webif^2 to modify the startup. I believe I talked about it in the wiki at the end of section 10. Otherwise there&#039;s some documentation in OpenWRT&#039;s wiki about automatic startup (depending on your type of install it&#039;s different (whiterussian or kamikaze)).</p><p>@boobee: I know, hans zandbelt has removed it, and apparently (According to someone that asked him through mail to have a copy of the repo) he&#039;s not really willing to give someone a backup as he considers whiterussian &quot;obsolete&quot;.<br />I would have gladly hosted one copy, or just dumped it on fileshack as I find this a bit extreme but well...<br />Anyhow, you can install Kamikaze instead (kernel 2.4) since it&#039;s got a webif^2 that is nearly finished (that was my main concern to stay with whiterussian), and the rest of the installation is pretty much the same, just change the path to asterisk14&#039;s repo so that it points to kamikaze on hans&#039;s website.<br />Plus you&#039;ll get all the updates from asterisk. I haven&#039;t had the time to update the wiki, but it&#039;s a wiki and since I&#039;m busy doing some other stuff, I hoped people would take the lead at one point in time.<br />Anyways, good luck.</p>									</div>
