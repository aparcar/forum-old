					<p>The firmware for the GL-MT300N is newer than the AR-150, but I am not clear if the if the issue with packages is resolved or not.&nbsp; Good question for the GLI forum.</p><p>In any case I have found it easier to use WinSCP to manage much of my config for all my routers.&nbsp; It&#039;s an &quot;FTP&quot; like interface for your router and has a CLI tool built in.&nbsp; I also use putty (at the same time).&nbsp; </p><p>You need to load two packages.&nbsp; From either CLI paste in the following strings.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install openvpn-openssl luci-app-openvpn</code></pre></div><p>Your config files are in the \etc\config\<br />Your openvpn keys go in \etc\openvpn\</p><p>OpenVPN will be installed, but not configured.&nbsp; I usually rename the \etc\config\openvpn file to openvpn_original as this file has a lot of comments that will get wiped, and is just to hard to read.&nbsp; They are good notes for reference.&nbsp; Use the WinScp tools to create a new blank file called openvpn.&nbsp; Select one of the sections (depends on your need =&gt; server or client, TUN or TAP) and copy it to the new blank file, then edit for your needs.</p><p>I have my open OpenWrt server and client on TAP, so my config may not be very helpful to you if you are planning on using a service.&nbsp; You should be able to get a linux script form most services, and just reformat it to the OpenWrt format (option [parameter]&#039;[value]&#039;)</p><p>Regarding WinScp.&nbsp; I make a folder on my loacal machine called [Router name], and the folders under it for config, etc and use WinSCP to download the config so I have a readily accessible copy of the config.&nbsp; I also keep a text file in the folder that is the &quot;[router name] config&quot; with notes on what i did (packages, config, mods).&nbsp; Helps me reinstall or upgrade a lot faster in the future.</p>									</div>
