					<p>Hello together,</p><p>I have a TL-WR1043ND with OpenWRT and a mounted USB stick.<br />I installed everything on the USB stick with opkg, so i have all the time to link all needed files from usb like /mnt/shares/usr/lib to the real /usr/lib.</p><p>I want to use PHPMyAdmin with my installed Apache (is working). So I installed all needed package like php5-mod-mysql ... .<br />If I want to visit my webserver in the browser, but then he tells me in the apache log, that he can&#039;t find the mysql.o file. <br />But the path is right, because he can use other extensions like session.so and the permissions of mysql.o are the same like session.so.<br />I see the imported extensions in phpinfo(). The mysql-server is running. </p><p>I think that mysql.o need some libs, but it does&#039;nt tell it to me somewhere. Or is there a problem with the php-cgi?</p><p>Thank you guys.</p>									</div>
