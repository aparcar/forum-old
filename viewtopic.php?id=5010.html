					<p>A friend of mine (Brittany Benzaia) just explained how to get it working.<br />Modify motorola-bin.c in {OpenWRT path}/target/utils/src/ by changing line 95 to &quot;firmware-&gt;flags = ntohl(0x10577040);&quot;(find the 5 in the number and change it to a 4). Then go back to the OpenWRT path and run make again.</p><p>Now I got the firmware on the AP and it seems to run, but the configuration is incorrect so it doesn&#039;t work right. (The AP&#039;s serial port has failed such that I could monitor what&#039;s going on but cannot enter commands, so I couldn&#039;t change the configuration using that method.)</p>									</div>
