					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I&#039;m pulling my hair out....</p><p>does anyone managed to compile quagga-unstable (0.99.11) on openwrt trunk?<br />I tried some 4 &quot;targets&quot; (x86, atheros, ixp, ar71xx...) but the compile ALWAYS fails in the &quot;prepare&quot; stage.</p><p>Errors are related to &quot;nvalid/bad&quot; Makefile with some strange erros with &quot;incorrect syntax&quot; etc.<br />But, those Makefile are create by configure....</p><p>Please, please.... any hint woule be very, very appreciated.</p><p>As I saw the wuagga-unstable compile in the dowloads/snapshots directories it should work... but HOW?</p><p>Are there any specific requrements on the HOST system? (currently using Fedora 10/11, I has quite a lot of problems building openwrt on debian x86_64 before...)</p><p>The problem is I NEED TCP MD5 support with Quagga, which should be supported in the 0.99.11 version....</p><p>I tried the snapshosts binaries but it seems the TCP MD5 is not activated in the kernel... so I rebuild the kernel with TCP MD5 support... and tried the quagga-0.99.11 on top of it... but quagga says &quot;unable to set tcp md5 signature on socket&quot;...<br />I checked to be sure the tcp md5 IS working on the compiled kernel (with some tools from quagga.net)</p><p>Any hints?</p><p>THANKS!</p>									</div>
