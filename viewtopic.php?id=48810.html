					<p><strong>HOWTO: Have rtorrent download files automatically and tweet you once a download finishes using TTYtter</strong></p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong><br /><em>rtorrent</em>—available through opkg<br /><em>leech</em>—.ipk available through <a href="https://bitbucket.org/alekseyt/leech">bitbucket</a><br /><em>TTYtter</em>—available from <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/">floodgap</a></p><p>Once all three have been installed, you&#039;re ready.</p><p><strong>First step:</strong> enable the rtorrent watchfolder</p><p>The rtorrent watchfolder is an option in the <em>.rtorrent.rc</em> file</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=/path/to/your/watchfolder/*.torrent</code></pre></div><p>Uncomment that line and enter the location you want it to look for torrents. For ease of general use, this should be a folder you have access to so you can manually save torrents there to trigger downloads, in addition to the automatic ones. It&#039;s a very bad idea to keep it on the router flash, as it will fill up very quickly.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong> use leech to populate the watchfolder</p><p>Now, following the leech notes (see bitbucket link above), you run it like so:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>CONFIG_DIR=&quot;/etc/leech&quot; DOWNLOADS_DIR=&quot;/path/to/your/watchfolder&quot; /usr/sbin/leech</code></pre></div><p>/etc/leech is where the configuration files reside, and DOWNLOADS_DIR is obviously your watchfolder, where .torrent files will be downloaded.</p><p>It&#039;s very straightforward from here.</p><p><em>/etc/leech/foods</em> is the plaintext file that holds the urls to your rss feeds. It will check all of them every time the script is run.</p><p><em>/etc/leech/wild-downloads</em> is the plaintext file where you put your wildcards, one to each line.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>legal tv show 1080p x264</code></pre></div><p>The above will match torrents that have ALL wildcards, in that order; in other words, <em>legal blondes tv and cable show 1080p x264</em> is a match.</p><p>Various other settings are available in the plaintext file located at <em>/etc/leech/default</em></p><p><strong>Step three:</strong> automation</p><p>For automation, chuck the following line into your crontab using <em>vi</em>, by writing <em>crontab -e</em>:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>*/10 * * * * CONFIG_DIR=/etc/leech DOWNLOADS_DIR=/path/to/your/watchfolder /usr/sbin/leech</code></pre></div><p>This will run leech every 10 minutes. You don&#039;t want it to check every minute, as it might be considered hammering the server of the torrent tracker.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have automatic torrent downloads.</p><p><strong>Step Four:</strong> setting up TTYtter</p><p>This is trickier. Out of the box, TTYtter, simple as it is, doesn&#039;t work. It will never allow you to connect to the twitter API. The reason is that curl is unable to authenticate the SSL certificate the API—which is now HTTPS-only—is offering.</p><p>To get around this, we will need to do two things:</p><p>1. Download a certificate bundle (the 250kb .pem from <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html">curl.haxx.se</a> is what I use). I converted it to a .crt, but at this stage I can&#039;t recall what that entailed. You can figure it out—in any case, you might not even have to!<br />2. Edit the source code of TTYtter to add a custom option to the <em>curl</em> authentication call.</p><p>Copy the certificate bundle file to your router.</p><p>Using a better text editor than vim, and preferably on your own computer, open the TTYtter file. It contains around 8,000 lines of abstruse perl. Don&#039;t fret!</p><p>Line 883-886 look like the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    $simple_agent = &quot;$baseagent -s -m 20&quot;;

    @wend = (&#039;-s&#039;, &#039;-m&#039;, &#039;20&#039;, &#039;-A&#039;, &quot;TTYtter/$TTYtter_VERSION&quot;,
            &#039;-H&#039;, &#039;Expect:&#039;);</code></pre></div><p>Change it to the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    $simple_agent = &quot;$baseagent -s -m 20 --cacert /path/to/your/ca.bundle&quot;;

    @wend = (&#039;-s&#039;, &#039;-m&#039;, &#039;20&#039;, &#039;--cacert&#039;, &#039;/path/to/your/ca.bundle&#039;, &#039;-A&#039;, &quot;TTYtter/$TTYtter_VERSION&quot;,
            &#039;-H&#039;, &#039;Expect:&#039;);</code></pre></div><p>Copy the TTYtter to where you want it on the router, and do a <em>chmod +x filename</em> to make it executable.</p><p>With that change, curl will finally play nice with TTYtter, and we are good to go. Run TTYtter (with the -seven option, as utf-8&nbsp; seems unsupported) and follow the instructions. </p><p>You have to be logged into twitter in whatever browser you use to authenticate the token TTYtter gives you to connect it to that account.</p><p><strong>Step five:</strong> Tweet on completed downloads</p><p>After step four, this will seem like child&#039;s play.</p><p>First of all, you will need to create a bash script that will call TTYtter:</p><p>In whatever folder you are working in (say <em>/etc/automation</em>) create a file called tweet.sh by typing <em>touch tweet.sh</em>. Fill the file with the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
/etc/automation/ttytter -silent -ssl -curl -seven -status=&quot;@yourtwittername Download Completed: $*&quot;</code></pre></div><p>And do a <em>chmod +x tweet.sh</em> to make it executable.</p><p>In <em>.rtorrent.rc</em>, add the following line (on one line):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>system.method.set_key = event.download.finished,mycustomcommand,&quot;execute=/etc/automation/tweet.sh,$d.get_name=&quot;</code></pre></div><p>In this line, <em>mycustomcommand</em> can be whatever you want it to be. <em>$*</em> appends everything rtorrent sends to tweet.sh.</p><p>And there you have it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>flippant</strong> on 6 Feb 2014, 08:54)</p>
