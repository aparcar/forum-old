					<p>Howdy folks,</p><p>For any of you setting up rules in your <strong>input_wan</strong> table and considering testing access by using the &quot;Shields Up!&quot; port probing utility at grc.com, note that their SYN probe tests are broken by the following entry in the default base case INPUT chain.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN SYN --tcp-option \! 2 -j  DROP</code></pre></div><p>When viewed with <strong>iptables -L</strong>, the rule appears as follows:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>DROP     tcp     --     *     *     0.0.0.0/0     0.0.0.0/0     tcp option=!2 flags:0x02/0x02</code></pre></div><p>Any connection tests from this website will show the ports as &quot;Stealth&quot; because the rule will silently drop these packets from the &quot;Shields Up!&quot; application.</p><p>Note that normal connection attempts work fine, as do most other port probing sites.&nbsp; It&#039;s just grc.com which is mis-reporting due to the lack of the MSS TCP option they use in their SYN packets.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaldek</strong> on 31 Mar 2008, 14:30)</p>

					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>Someone was nice enough to let me know about ShieldsUP!&#039;s problem with OpenWRT-based systems.&nbsp; Since I certainly want SU to work in every case, I have just added an MSS option (Maximum Segment Size) to GRC&#039;s outbound port-testing SYN packets.</p><p>You guys should note, however, that TCP options, including MSS, are truly optional, and that dropping inbound SYNs without an MSS option seems rather pointless to me.&nbsp; It&#039;s not providing you with any sort of &quot;protection&quot; and it could cause you to be unable to accept valid incoming TCP connections -- as ShieldsUP! was previously showing.</p><p>But in any event, with that iptables rule in place, you will now find that ShieldsUP! will correctly show your router&#039;s open and connection-accepting ports.</p><p>All the best,<br />Steve Gibson.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Kaldek...</p><p>As a security fanatic I&#039;d LOVE to know the logic behind that.&nbsp; I sure can&#039;t see any.</p><p>The only possible use that I could imagine would be to prevent a DoS SYN flood through the firewall ... since &quot;handmade&quot; SYN packets (like mine and) like those produced by DoS bots, might well lack any MSS option (as mine used to).</p><p>So I suppose that the rule *could* be used to discriminate between regular TCP OS-stack built SYN packets and &quot;others&quot;.&nbsp; But in the case of a DoS flood, blocking the packets at the router or firewall won&#039;t, of course, do anything to avert an attack since it&#039;s the bandwidth in front of the router that would still be flooded.</p><p>So ... again ... I really don&#039;t see the logic.&nbsp; And, if it were my iptables ruleset, I&#039;d remove that one.</p><p>But, in any event, I&#039;m glad to have made ShieldsUP! more compatible with what&#039;s actually out there in the real world.&nbsp; That&#039;s my job!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>(And thanks for your confirmation that yesterday&#039;s change did the trick!)</p><p>All the best,<br />Steve.</p>									</div>

					<p>The rule was added years ago when it was observed that the only TCP packets that didn&#039;t set the MSS were those from tools which worked by raw packet injection, typically script kiddie tools. While it&#039;s not nearly as effective as it once had been (many tools have adapted), it still works as a bozo filter.</p><p>Uh, no offense, Steve <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
