					<p>Oh yes, didn&#039;t think about that. But would it work if I put a 74HCT08 as a 5V -&gt; 3.3V level shifter between them?

					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I&#039;ve been a lurker here for a while, but have recently bitten the bullet and taken the soldering iron to the TL-WR703N. I followed the previous discussion and chose GPIO pins 7 and 29 to create an I2C bus. Installing OpenWRT drivers was not too hard (although there was an issue with the kmod-i2c-algo-bit dependencies) and it works to flash LEDs on a PCF8574 IO expander. The linux kernel&#039;s drivers for the PCF8574 also work, allowing individual control of each IO pin of the PCF8574 from the filesystem.</p><p>I wrote the process up in my blog, for those who are interested:<br /><a href="http://pragti.ch/kippycam/Adding%20an%20I2C%20interface%20to%20the%20TL-WR703N.html">http://pragti.ch/kippycam/Adding%20an%2 … R703N.html</a></p><p>Please let me know any mistakes or if there should be any clarifications.</p><p>Thanks go to imperfect and MBS for documenting their learning and inspiring me to do this.</p><p>pragtich</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to contribute some info we worked out while testing my expander board with these routers regarding U6.</p><p>The chip labelled U6 on the router is not an LDO, but rather it appears to be a power distribution switch for the &quot;3G&quot; USB port.&nbsp; It appears to be something similar to TI&#039;s TPS2051B - pin-out makes sense, but probably from another vendor based on the marking.&nbsp; This is presumably in place to allow software power control of a plugged in 3G USB modem.</p><p>The enable signal appears to be controlled by GPIO8.&nbsp; There is also a connection to the over-current sense, which I believe is on GPIO6.<br />It can be bypassed by putting a blob of solder across the empty pads labelled R113, which I&#039;ve found useful to power the router from my expander board, rather than vice-versa.</p><p>Also from what I can tell, C107/C108 are for decoupling of the 5V input on the microUSB connector prior to the U5 switching reg, and not connected to the shields as mentioned in the above summary.&nbsp; Similarly I think C113/C115 are decoupling the 5V at the 3G USB connector.&nbsp; It looks to me that the 3 connectors have all their shields connected together, and are bypassed to GND via C37 and C114.</p><p>Hope this is of help, and I hope to contribute more when I get a spare moment back in the lab to desolder the chips on one of my units and analyse the PCB further.</p><p>Kean</p>									</div>

The more people are involved, the best chances we have to understand this device in all its details</p><p>What still puzzles me is the exact role of the 2 Q1/Q2 transistors: my guess is that they are used for power-related things. Probably 1 is for the Ethernet analog power, the other one is mounted very close to the SDRAM chip on several TP-Link routers, so I don&#039;t think this is just a coincidence.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Squonk</strong> on 28 Aug 2012, 23:22)</p>
