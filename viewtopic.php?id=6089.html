					<p>Hi @ all,</p><p>yes this is my first post but I´m a proud owner of a OpenWRT-flashed WRT54GL, now to my questions:</p><p>After some problems connecting to the router ( 802.1x - authentification problems ) I finally managed to go online via WLAN.<br />But the throughput is more than worse! Average: about 60 KB/s. Any solutions?</p><p>Another thing is that my public IP-adress switches unregulary, but about every 5 minutes - could the OpenWRT be the reason or the provider?<br />As a (possible) result, loading pages sometimes, again unregulary, ends in a connection error..</p><p>Hope someone can help me out! Of course I´m able to post some important logs.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>themaiday</p>									</div>

It is shortly able to reach the 120kb/s, but than there is a connection lag and the throughput goes down.. <br />Even SSH/Telnet Sessions lag sometimes...</p><p>Noise sources could be a DECT telephone. Are there special channels with a good compability to DECT-phones?<br />There is also a microwave in range, but unused.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>stephan wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Your syslog might tell you why.
