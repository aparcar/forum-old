					<p>Hi,</p><p>I tried to set up my Fonera as a transparent wireless bridge in order to connect to a remote AP (actually, a service provider, so I need to keep things transparent) with my laptop:</p><p>AP &lt; +&nbsp; +&nbsp; + &gt; (wireless) fon (wired) &lt;---&gt; laptop</p><p>I wanted also to have a VAP on a different subnet, which would allow a quick reconfiguration. I managed to set up the VAP, I can use the fon in client mode as well (it gets an IP address from the router), but I&#039;m unable to set up bridging so that it transmits everything transparently. Could you give a hint, how to do this? (I tried all that with the LuCI)<br />Thanks,<br />Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much, I tried it out, it works and probably will work where I intend to use it.</p><p>But anyway, I used to use a WRT54GL with the Thibor fw as a bridge and I liked that setup very much. Could I still configure OpenWRT similarly?</p>									</div>

					<p>Why is the answer always &quot;Use WDS instead of client/sta&quot;?&nbsp; I mean if it&#039;s really broken and does not do what it&#039;s supposed to why is it even in the build -- especially a stable one at that?&nbsp; At the end of the day client/sta is not WDS -- they are inherently different from an operational perspective so WDS is not always a feasible answer as a replacement.</p>									</div>
