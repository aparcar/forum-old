It is also a good way to begin with developing, then you learn a lot of the essential skills needed to take part in the development process.</p><p>I have recently announced a new initiative with the some what cryptic name WIP-Day --&gt; <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11193">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11193</a></p><p>WIP-Day will take place on the up-coming saturday at UTC 12.00 and 24 hours ahead, OpenWrt members who would like to participate should just join #openwrt-devel.</p><p>If your interested in learning about how to create packages then a good place to start would be --&gt; <a href="http://nbd.name/openwrt#x1-330002.1.2">http://nbd.name/openwrt#x1-330002.1.2</a></p><p>Another activity could be to add a list of packages, in this thread, who needs updating or result in installation problems - then other members could have a chance to give it a go <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>									</div>
