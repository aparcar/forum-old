					<p>Hi,</p><p>Im using a WL-500gP with a Quickcam pro 9000 to take hires (1600x1200) images at a defined interval (e.g. 60 secs.) ; openwrt 8.09 as OS.<br />The webcam is detected by the uvc driver and everything shoult work, but using mjpeg at this high resolution will result in heavy cpu load, even ssh (second putty) will not work anymore. sometimes the streamer will not start due to memory reasons ...<br />I call mjpeg_streamer this way:</p><p>mjpg_streamer -i &quot;input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0 -r 1600x1200 -y -q 90&quot; -o &quot;output_file.so -f /mnt/usbdrive/data/images -d 5000 -s 6000&quot;</p><p>maybe mjpeg_streamer is oversized for my needs, so I&#039;m searching for another tool that takes a image from the webcam to file and quits, I would use cron to call the tool every XX seconds (thats another point against mjpeg_streamer, cause this awesome prg runs as a deamon and I don&#039;t need to take images at night ;-) <br />any ideas?</p><p>thanx for your attention</p><p>regards,<br />bit</p>									</div>
