					<p>This morning, I stupidly configured dropbear to port 443. (pause to laugh at me). I rebooted to make the change take effect, but the router didn&#039;t started up properly. I think this is due to the fact that webif probably uses 443 as well. As expected, I can no longer access webif or ssh. I also have telnet turned off so I can&#039;t access the router that way.</p><p>Is it likely that tftp will respond even if this conflict exists? I&#039;m not sure when/how the tftp daemon is started, but if it is started early in the router boot process, perhaps it will respond. If so, I should be update to ftp a new /etc/init.d/S50dropbear file to correct the port conflict.</p><p>If tftp isn&#039;t an option, will I have visibility to the /etc/init.d directory in failsafe mode?</p><p>Thanks much for the help. I&#039;m not in front of my router right now, but I&#039;m trying to ascertain the probability of whether I bricked it. If tftp or failsafe mode don&#039;t appear to be viable options, then I&#039;ll pick up a new router on the way home from work.</p><p>I&#039;m running a Linksys WRT54G version 1.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, things are ok now. Later in the day the web interface began responding again. I edited the necessary config files to rollback my changes, rebooted, and am now online.</p>									</div>
