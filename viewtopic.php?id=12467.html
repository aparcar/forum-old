					<p>Dear All</p><p>Due to work I&#039;ll be visiting San Francisco and the Bay Area from the 11th until the 21th of October (this year). I have some weekend days which are free and this made me think: Why not ask around if some of the members/users of OpenWrt would like to meet for some social R&amp;R.</p><p>It would be fun to grab the chance and get-together for an OpenWrt-It/Hack-day together with who&#039;s interested - the only problem is that I have no idea about a good place to meet (would probably be nice if there was: Net, electricity and a roof to keep potential rain away)?</p><p>I would like to suggest that this could take place on saturday the 13th of October - and I would be really happy if some of the locals could suggest a place (please help me)?</p><p>If somebody has a private &quot;basement-project&quot; or an idea to present and/or discuss would just make it even more fun. </p><br/><p>Chz</p><p>PS. Feel free to send me an email in regard to this subject :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m still visiting the Bay Area - and I&#039;m still wondering if some of the OpenWrt users/developers living in the area are interested in meeting (somewhere in the area) and spending a few social hours in company with each other?</p><p>I&#039;m more than willing to tell a few tales, if someone wants to listen :-)</p><p>Chz</p>									</div>
