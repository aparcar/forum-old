					<p>How it&#039;s working this combination, I mean the latest backfire rc4 image (this <a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/brcm47xx/">http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/brcm47xx/</a> ) ?<br />Have someone tested this?</p><p>Which image you would suggest me to use (version with kernel 2.6 [<a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/brcm47xx/">http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/brcm47xx/</a>] or with kernel 2.4 [<a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/brcm-2.4/">http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03.1-rc4/brcm-2.4/</a>]) for having working the list below:<br />- audio enabled on USB (C-Media adapter which works great with kernel 2.6 but with 2.4 it&#039;s not even recognized)<br />- printer server (HP LaserJet P1102n) on USB (works great in LPR mode on original Asus firmware), have trouble with RAW mode, last page is sent to printer in a infinite loop<br />- bluetooth dongle standard<br />- ftp server (USB flash disk) -- <br />- ssh server &amp; scp<br />- 3G GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSDPA modem on USB (for WAN), to be used only when there are troubles with ethernet WAN<br />- web-cam (I have one piece of Microsoft Lifecam VX-1000 but it seems that even Ubuntu does not have drivers for it), I will look for an other<br />- some applications to be installed on external fs (8 MB is not enough for all these packages)<br />- WI-FI should work acceptable (I tested on kernel 2.6 and the speed is reduced at HALF from the speed of using build with 2.4 kernel).</p><p>I know there are some problems with b43 and b43legacy drivers for Broadcom wireless cards. But I don&#039;t know the status of them, are they solved? Since november when 10.03.1-rc4 was released I don&#039;t have any other build to test.<br />Maybe I should try building from svn?<br />Any suggestion would be appreciated.</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>hehe, choose either Bluetooth or Wireless.</p><p>last time I tried, there was no way of getting bt to work under 2.4, while wifi under 2.6 is still buggy and seems to stop randomly</p><p>Also I donÂ´t think you will have enough RAM for all of that.<br />Oh, btw, for hard drive, Webcam and 3G the USB 1.1 provided by lin2.4 should be enough</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I could choose Wireless but bluetooth I wish I had only for controling audio player (for playing intrnet radio stations directly on router, without having some computer intervention).<br />But I didn&#039;t succeed to get audio working on kernel 2.4. It seems that internal (asus) USB hub is somehow interfering in seeing audio device by kernel. In other words, ehci/ochi/uchi modules had some problems with the audio device.<br />I could resume to what I need most to work: WI-FI, printer server, ftp server (ssh server is working on both builds), audio.</p><p>So, how I could get this done?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dumghen</strong> on 16 Feb 2011, 13:07)</p>

					<p>hmm, check if you have the version with the minipci slot. If so, you could give 2.6 a try using some other card. if this fails and if you can live with lower performance, go for 2.6 and a wireless lan usb adapter. However, your device will be kinda quelling with devices, and I seriously doubt that the 500g has enough ram to support all your needs - in the end, openwrt is simply not intended to be a multimedia system to that extent :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>well, that is quite simple. check for the chipset of your wireless. then check in the imagebuilder whether a driver has been ported to your target platform already. If so, it should show up unter kernel-&gt;modules-&gt;wireless devices</p><p>you can find out what chipset you have by attaching it to a linux computer and having a look at the last lines of dmesg. or if its listed on wireless.linux.org the chipset should be listed there as well.</p><p>For the how to use part - you use it exactly the same way you would use your internal wifi. create a config entry, and you are ready to go.</p>									</div>

					<p>So far I realized:<br />- audio works well (still there is lack of a good mini console player like shell-fm that knows all streams, weget|madplay works for mp3 and ogg streams)<br />- printer server solved, works well if you disable Enable bidirectional support in windows/linux and in wrt. (raw)<br />- bluetooth works fine without starting some applciations (hciconfig hci0) and anyremote are all you need to have remote control<br />- vsftps is ok, still need to configure it, using mountd for mounting automatically flash drive<br />- dropbear ssh and scp works ok<br />- web-cam, incredbile, it works fine (Microsoft Lifecam VX-1000) with modules: kmod-usb-video kmod-i2c-core kmod-video-core kmod-video-gspca-core kmod-video-gspca-sonixj and mjpg-streamer<br />- 3G usb modem didn&#039;t try but usb-modeswitch, chat and comgt should be fine</p><p>- the broadcom Wi-Fi does not work, if it is enabled, and is set with some security level, it will crash the kernel ==&gt; very sad<br />- I will try the USB dongle TEW-429UB C1, with Zydas druver (zd1211rw), hope it will work</p><p>All this on kernel 2.6 without any other partition for kernel.</p>									</div>

					<p>Does anyone know if the broadcom wifi in ASUS WL500gP v2 already works with kernel 2.6? I would like to use a Logitech Quickcam 4000 pro which works just fine with Oleg&#039;s firmware on WL500gP v2, but for Backfire with kernel 2.4 there seems to be no PWC driver. With kernel 2.6 it seems to be possible to compile PWC as a module..</p>									</div>
