					<p>Ok to start off with my first post here, i&#039;m very sorry for my noobishness.<br />But I jumped into a project that seems to be a little to much for me to understand in a short time.<br />That&#039;s also the reason why googling or searching the forum wasn&#039;t succesfully for me, because I don&#039;t know where to look for.<br />But I hope you guys can and want to help me with my issue.</p><p>So I read a lot of people who are making usb devices accessible over their wifi using the ser2net module in openwrt.<br />Now I wanted to do the same thing to get my boiler controller accessible via wifi.<br />The problem that I have is that I bought the TL-WRT710N V2 from TP-link. nice little router for the money, but the V2 only has 4MB of flash.<br />Which results in the problem that i don&#039;t have enough space to run Luci which again results in not being able to manage everything by gui but only command line.<br />And nooby as I&#039;am my linux skills are not good enough to get everything done.</p><p>So the things that I need to find out now first is, <br />-How to get the tp-link via command line on my main wifi connection as a device an not as a router.<br />and<br />-Where to go from there, I can find enough tutorials on how to setting up ser2net but how do i get there and again how and where do i adjust the router.</p><p>Hopefully you all understand what i mean with my poor english and help me out on this one, or at least pointing me in the right way where to start.<br />thnx</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey thanks for your response.<br />I allready installed a openwrt firmware that somebody else compiled with the ser2net, so that&#039;s not my main problem.<br />The thing is just that i don&#039;t know where to go from here.<br />How en where I setup the ser2net module, and in which mode i need to run the router (basic, AP etc.).<br />The extra problem is, Im not an IT guy so a lot of words and expressions make no sense to me. on top of that searching in SSH makes that a wee bit harder.</p><p>But hanks for your links, in my spare time i&#039;m going to dive into that so i get a bit more familiar with what the builds are all about.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>j_jk</strong> on 16 Sep 2015, 04:11)</p>

					<p>Basically, you should ssh to your router and then edit /etc/ser2net.conf</p><p>Add a port with your desired config (should match your device specs), or use some of the preconfigured ones:</p><p>For instance:<br />6666:raw:600:/dev/ttyUSB0:115200 NONE 1STOPBIT 8DATABITS -XONXOFF -LOCAL -RTSCTS </p><p>Like that, you can access to your serial device using your router IP and port 6666.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, you can do that.</p><p>However, the same should apply when you are connected by cable. Simply, be sure that you are connected to the WAN port.</p>									</div>
