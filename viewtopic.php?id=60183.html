					<p>Hello,<br />I am having a slight problem with a Billion 7800 image file. I have extracted the CFE, ROOTFS, KERNEL and TAG file from the image and have made modifications to the ROOTFS. I then repack the ROOTFS using squashfs4.3 and the Broadcom image builder tool. After I upload the new image I get this message:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>*** Press any key to stop auto run (1 seconds) ***
Auto run second count down: 0
Booting from only image (0xb8010000) ...
Code Address: 0x80010000, Entry Address: 0x8030e340
Linux file system CRC error.  Corrupted image?</code></pre></div><p>I have tried many ways to fix this problem at first I thought it was something to do with lzma compression but that’s not it then I checked whether it had something to do with big endian and little endian so I repacked using both methods still no success. <br />I saw a file in the rootfs system called cfg_checksum so possibly an algorithm that checks for any changes during boot time so deleted it and repacked the rootfs system still no luck. I am out of ideas need some help…<br />Here is link to the firmware and extracted files. </p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u38ofgz9vchkr2x/AAAnyZhQYvPuXEqKXaaOJ5r0a?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u38ofgz9vchk … J5r0a?dl=0</a></p>									</div>
