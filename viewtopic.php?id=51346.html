					<p>Hi, I have a tplink WR1043ND v1 with OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment on my network I have Synology DSM 5.0 with ip 192.168.1.102 and my PC with IP 192.168.1.100 </p><p>When I connect to port 192.168.1.102:5000 redirects me to HTTPS 5001 (192.168.1.102:5001) and does not connect. The same applies to the 9091 transmission, do not connect. </p><p>If I try to connect by DDNS via WAN not connected. But if connecting from another ISP (mobile Internet), does works</p><p>I had to reinstall the official firmware tp-link to work. I do not know where it is crashing with OpenWRT. </p><p>Any idea? </p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>XHAGBARD</strong> on 30 Jun 2014, 02:35)</p>
