					<p>Your question is a bit hard to understand, you are looking for a browser you can run on your router? There are no browser apps for LuCI that I am aware of, but there&#039;s elinks, a text-based browser for the command shell. Maybe that helps?</p>									</div>

					<p>Poor English is not a problem, but you must be a little more specific. elinks is working perfectly fine on BB14.07, but it probably doesn&#039;t do what you want it to do. What did you try, and what didn&#039;t work? &quot;and nothing&quot; is not sufficient as an error description. Also, you should probably include your router maker and model.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 12 Oct 2014, 11:07)</p>
