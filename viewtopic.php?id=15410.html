					<p>I assume you used the MGB100 RedBoot image. My goal is to be able to generate images that can be flashed on without bootloader access, which can alternatively be used with that RedBoot. The primary obstacle at the moment is that a new flash-mapping driver that knows how to deal with AMIT&#039;s flash layout needs to be written. I would be glad to discuss this more at length in #openwrt-devel on FreeNode.</p>									</div>
