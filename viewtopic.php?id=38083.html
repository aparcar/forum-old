					<p>I&#039;m doing some failure testing with a Vodafone Huawei KS4511 connected to a TP-LINK MR3420 running OpenWRT r32651.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got it set up with a 3g-wan interface and all works well until I get the modem to lose the radio signal by wrapping it in aluminium foil and putting it in a metal box (the modem is on a USB flylead so I don&#039;t have to put the router in the box as well!).</p><p>The problem is that when I get the modem out of the box and unwrap it, I continually get &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; in response to the ATD command in the chat script that PPPD uses to restart things.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried playing with the /etc/chatscripts/3g.chat script that&#039;s used by PPPD to set up the connection, but I can&#039;t find the right bit of magic to get the modem to restart properly.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what I&#039;m using.&nbsp; I added the AT\d\d\d\d\d lines to slow things down a bit, and ATZ as that&#039;s supposed to reset the modem.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ABORT   BUSY

					<p>I finally tracked down an authoritative list of Huawei AT commands at <a href="http://wenku.baidu.com/view/11798f4133687e21af45a938.html">http://wenku.baidu.com/view/11798f41336 … 5a938.html</a>.&nbsp; The site is in Chinese but the document is English.&nbsp; There&#039;s an irritating Flash-based online reader for it - I can&#039;t work out how to download the PDF - so I had a quick scan, which turned out to be very beneficial...</p><p>Section 2.2.2 on page 8 talks about the ATD command, which is used in the chat script to initiate the data call.&nbsp; The blurb notes that the modem supports a BLACKLIST function according to GSM 02.07 Annex A, so that after a predefined number of failed call attempts to the same number that number gets added to a read-only phonebook called .blacklist.&nbsp; Further attempts to call that number are barred by the ME (i.e. the modem) and are not signalled to the network.&nbsp; And the result code in this case is … NO CARRIER.</p><p>So this must be what I am observing with the K4511 (and a K3520 I also have) in the chat script output.&nbsp; I get a number of failed call attempts while the modem is in the Faraday cage, so the *99***1# dial string gets added to the blacklist.&nbsp; When I take the modem out of the cage, the dial attempts continue to fail because the number is blacklisted.</p><p>The document goes on to say that a number is removed froth blacklist automatically if a timer condition specified in GSM 02.07 Annex A is met, though it doesn&#039;t say what this condition is (but I bet it involves NOT attempting to call the number for a period of time).&nbsp; However, the document does say that the blacklist can be cleared manually using the command AT^SPBD.</p><p>Unfortuntely the K3520 reports &quot;ERROR&quot; when I put that command in my chat script.</p><p>Any suggestions?!</p>									</div>
