					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I think I just semi-bricked my DLink DIR-505 A1.</p><p>I moved to a new apt and brought this router along, with the old config. As the connection in the new apt was really poor, I thought it could be a good idea to update/upgrade the packages, before I tweaked the configs.</p><p>I started with the opkg, but it failed. I forgot to save the error messages, but now, when I try to open opkg, it returns: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-ash: opkg: not found</code></pre></div><p>I navigated to /bin and it was there, though I can&#039;t run it from there either.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C8pOcSJ.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/C8pOcSJ.jpg" /></span></p><p>I&#039;ve tried then to update the firmware, but, because the device&#039;s storage is so small, I can&#039;t get the .bin file to fit so I can convert it to the .trx format (the device have less than 2MB and the firmware have 7.5MB - I also think this is why the opkg failed, but it&#039;s just a hypothesis) </p><br /><p><strong>What can I do in this situation?</strong></p><br /><br /><p>Thanks in regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think I understood your answer...<br />I already know how to strip the header of an firmware .bin file. The problem is that my storage can&#039;t hold it, probably because the opkg upgrade failed. </p><p>I know there&#039;s is a script that removes all the trunk caused by an failed install, BUT the failed package was the opkg itself,&nbsp; rendering the entire process useless. </p><p>All I want is to fix the opkg, that doesn&#039;t run at all, as said in the beggining of my first post. </p><p>Thanks again.</p>									</div>
