					<p>Hello</p><p>The lldpd package is quite far behind, (0.3 latest is 0.6)</p><p>I dont think many people use it, as having an embedded switch in a router will mask it, but on WAPs i find it very useful.</p><p>Im hoping someone, especially a core developer, is willing to update the package in exchange for a donation to openwrt project (ie cash via paypal)</p><p>Anyone interested?</p>									</div>
