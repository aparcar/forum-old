					<p>Sorry for the Noob question but I am fairly new to OpenWRT. I currently run a home automation platform (Vera from Micasaverde) that runs off an Asus wl500gp router. It has OpenWrt on it along with the home automation stack which the source code is available on. </p><p>The Asus router just doesn&#039;t have enough hp to get the job done. I just purchased a routerstation pro and installed OpenWRT Backfire on it. I would like to take the backfire source and compile it with the Vera Source Code (<a href="http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/Source_Code">http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/Source_Code</a>) that is available in a tar format. </p><p>What do I need to do this? </p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
