					<p>Got a question regarding iptables-configuration!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a weird setup at home in which both my cable modem and my printer is connected to the WAN-port on my WRT54GL with the help of a switch!</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-----------            ----------
| WRT54GL |--wan-port--| Switch |
-----------            ----------
 | | | | |               |    |
 local/wifi          Cable    Printer
                  public ip   192.168.0.202</code></pre></div><p>The WRT54GL box is running Kamikaze 7.09 (kernel 2.4 brcm, the standard stuff), and got no fancy packages or configuration yet. I just set the local IP (on the WRT54GL) to 192.168.0.254, and the dhcp range is from 1 to 150, other that that I have not edited much. The printer is configured with a static ip, 192.168.0.202. It has to be connected through wan because of physical placement, as the cable modem and printer is in one room, and the WRT54GL is in another.</p><p>And here the fun begins!</p><p>I manage, when I&#039;ve ssh&#039;ed myself into kamikaze, to ping the printer if I manually make a new interface on the WAN-interface and then make a route:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@Ruter:~# ifconfig eth0.1:1 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
root@Ruter:~# route add -net 192.168.0.202 netmask 255.255.255.255 dev eth0.1:1</code></pre></div><p>But accessing the printer from shell is of course not enough! How should I configure iptables to allow requests to 192.168.0.202 to get routed the right way? I want everyone on the local net to be able to access the printer...</p><p>Would be greatly thankful if anyone could help me with this :)</p>									</div>

					<p>hi</p><p>I think you should at first add the eth0.1 device to the bridge then it should be possible to contact the printer. Add you wlan to the bridge, too. Simply add &quot;option network lan&quot; and if you use madawifi driver in your hostapd.conf the u must add &quot;bridge=br-lan&quot;<br />(deactivting the firewall and disconnect the internet from the switch)</p><p>Now you setup the Internet connection through the iptables rules. </p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### VLAN configuration

					<p>Thanks for the reply :) But there&#039;s just one thing... bridging virtual devices doesn&#039;t work, you can&#039;t bridge eth0.1:0 without including eth0.1:1, I tried that one... but maybe it will work anyway thanks to just one device receiving an address from the cable modem! I won&#039;t know before... well, Friday, because I won&#039;t be home to test it before then (don&#039;t want to test this setup remotely and screw up the connection till friday)</p><p>But to be sure I can test more things than this on Friday, how should firewall.user or /etc/config/firewall or even /etc/init.d/firewall look like if I would like iptables to accept connections to the 192.168.1.x-range both ways through eth0.1 (e.g. I set the printer IP to 192.168.1.2 and eth0.1:1 to 192.168.1.1)? Should this work by default?</p>									</div>

					<p>This setup had a very easy fix to get it to work :) Didn&#039;t do any magic at all with either /etc/config/firewall, /etc/init.d/firewall or /etc/config/network. Just added &quot;ifconfig eth0.1:0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up&quot; to a script which starts at boot, and set the static IP of the printer to 192.168.1.2, and then everything worked like a charm :) The trick was, of course, to keep things away from each other by dividing it into subnets.</p><p>Thanks for help anyway :)</p>									</div>
