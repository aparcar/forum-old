					<p>Just a quick post to say thank you.</p><p>I&#039;m new to openWrt and have been struggling with my TP-Link TL-WA901N v3 using the latest stock firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bad reception, dropouts and chromecast would finally work after a number of re-attempts.</p><p>I have since installed openWrt on my access point and wow what a difference.&nbsp; Wifi reception seems much better and chromecast work first time and continues to stay connected. </p><p>Great work guys, wish I had installed this years ago. It&#039;s made me realise how bad the stock TPLink firmware was!!</p><p>Cheers!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>digitalgeek.me</strong> on 7 Mar 2017, 12:07)</p>
