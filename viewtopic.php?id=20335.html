					<p>Well, I have a project that is currently pending due to lack of time... I would like to build a &#039;remote control&#039; system for my router. The current product so far is a piece of software on the router that listens on the Bluetooth dongle connected to the USB port, and another piece of software on my Symbian S60 Nokia telephone that connects to it and receives a welcome messege. Only you know how elaborate project you can imagine for yourself (and implement). From querying basic information to executing arbitrary command on the shell and observing the result you have quite many options. The Bluetooth part of the communication is not difficult to code at all - at least nothing more complex than a simple TCP/IP socket application.</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t find bluetooth to be as easy as neutron is making out, so I wrote this page mainly for my own benefit:<br /><a href="http://www.biffer.talktalk.net/bluetooth/">http://www.biffer.talktalk.net/bluetooth/</a></p><p>Last time I tried this I couldn&#039;t get it to work with the Edimax though.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a problem with the USB 1.0 port, it seemed to be something else.</p><p>cheers,<br />Biff.</p>									</div>

There are some things I hate in Symbian, e.g. handling of strings). The client will use sockets to communicate. Actually, once you have a socket that represents a connection, sending data is a piece of cake. You can consult an arbitrary TCP/IP socket tutorial to learn more. The problematic part is always the process through which you obtain the socket. For these issues, I consulted my &#039;Software development for mobile devices&#039; lecture slides for the Symbian side, and a BlueZ tutorial for the OpenWRT side.</p><p>Regards<br />Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>Before I forget: before starting to code, be sure to check that the Bluetooth dongle is recognised by the box. HCID must be running and the command hcitool dev must show your device.</p>									</div>

I see no reason why your Edimax box wouldn&#039;t run it...</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>justinjose12002 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>if i use bluz libs ...desktop inbuilt bluetooth&nbsp; devices access and usb dongle access are same..?</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, I have never tried to code anything Bluetooth-related for an x86 PC with on-board Bluetooth, but I don&#039;t think that anything would justify any substantial difference between the two scenarios - at least not from the application developer&#039;s point of view.</p><p>Regards<br />Adam</p>									</div>
