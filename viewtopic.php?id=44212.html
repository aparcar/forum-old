					<p>I currently have a Asus RT-N13U-B1 router. I have a external 3.5 bay that is self powered (plugs into AC outlet, and doesn&#039;t depend on usb power), and a usb printer. Both work for about 3 months connected to the usb hub. After about 3 months the hubs just die. I confirmed that the hubs are dead by connecting it to my laptop, and plugging a usb stick into the hub, and nothing is detected. </p><p>I&#039;ve gone through two hubs. My previous USB router, an Asus WL-520, ran with dd-wrt and a hub for years and didn&#039;t blink.</p><p>So, in retrospect, I&#039;m not sure if the router is burning out the hubs, or the fact that I had a self powered external 3.5 bay connected to it. I don&#039;t see why it would since the 3.5 bay doesn&#039;t depend on USB power. Any ideas would be helpful.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is very unlikely that the router is blowing the hubs.<br />In my experience it is the peripherals that can cause trouble by drawing too much power. When you say external 3.5 bay, do you mean a &quot;caddy&quot; containing a 3.5&quot; hard drive? There are notoriously unreliable. We used them to transfer data from wrecked computers at maybe 4 times per week. We replaced them about every 2 months.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sometimes usb hubs are way to cheaply build and if there is a lot of power consumption sometimes it does burn out the power regulator inside.</p><p>(had a few of those with noname brand cheap things)</p>									</div>
