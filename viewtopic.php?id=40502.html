					<p>About 18 months ago, a developer here helped me by adding the definitions for my 3G modem, Alcatel X220D. Ticket was 9422. These were committed in r26906 and r26907. Now I have built from current trunk and support for X220D is gone. Maybe I don&#039;t understand how submitting patches works, but is seems to me that these got dropped in the last 18 months.</p><p>Thanks for looking into this.</p><p>Perazim</p>									</div>
