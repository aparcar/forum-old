					<p>Ahh.. Ok.. trying not to be spoon fed here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> but do you know of a how-to anywhere? I seriously can&#039;t seem to wade through all the junk on google to find the relevant info. Closest thing I&#039;ve been able to find is how to recompile the squashfs kernel module for lzma.. I&#039;m assuming all that isn&#039;t necessary just to extract the image?</p>									</div>

					<p>Aha.. Got it done. Found a working unsquashfs-lzma v3 that worked from an old openwrt buildroot I had on this linux box <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Now to figure out how to put this netgear into debug mode, looks like it starts up a telnetd then.</p><p>Anyway, thanks again for the tip on lzma!</p>									</div>
