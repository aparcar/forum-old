					<p>Hey there,</p><p>i&#039;ve been playing around with hostapd and nas for a while. I am trying out 802.1x Authentication for WiFi these days and i kinda found out that hostapd sends radius accounting messages, on the other hand NAS doesn&#039;t.</p><p>Any ideas if there is a binary patch or anything that would help me getting radius accounting done with my broadcom cards?</p><p>Altho if it is a commercial product you might need to recommend, just tell me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>best regards</p>									</div>

					<p>i should also mention that as soon as i&#039;ve configured WPA/EAP with nas, and then run chilli results in system hangs. i can&#039;t figure out what&#039;s causing it.</p>									</div>
