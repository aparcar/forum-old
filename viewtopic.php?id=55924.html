					<p>Hello,<br />I have a TL-MR3020&nbsp; (AA 12.09 , last stable) working well and powered with the &quot;original&quot; power adapter.</p><p>If I connect a USB webcam (Logitech C170)&nbsp; on the USB (unpowered) mini-hub , <br />the C170 device is not recognized:&nbsp; i.e. with &quot;lsusb&quot; the webcam is not seen at all !</p><p>But if I power the MR3020 directly from the usb port of my laptop the C170 is correctly seen at boot time and it works fine (mjpg-streamer).</p><p>Returning with the &quot;original&quot; power adapter the device C170 is not recognized.<br />I used a 2nd identical MR3020&nbsp; (same identical configuration) ... but the problem is exactly the same.</p><p>I guess the reason may be in the electrical system of my house (interferences?)....&nbsp; but I have not idea how solve this problem.<br />Any suggestion ?

I just experienced that there are differences: Cable A (=original, data + power) charges my phone with 900mA; Cable B (fake, data + power) charges my phone with 475mA -&gt; less copper in the cable -&gt; more voltage drop, less current<br />- Have you tried a powered hub (i.e. external power supply for the hub)?<br />- Do you have any known interference sources on the ground floor, e.g. powerline-LAN, baby monitor (audio / video / wireless), electronic devices with swith mode power supply, ...?<br />Pull out the mains plugs of all electrical devices on the ground floor. ALL! Then check if the camera gets detected.<br />If yes, plug in one more device, check again if camera gets detected. Repeat until camera isn&#039;t recognized any more -&gt; You found the interfering device.<br />If no: At least you know now that it&#039;s not an electrical device on the ground floor.<br />- What happens if you unplug/replug the USB cam? Any signs in dmesg?<br />- How do you determine &quot;USB cam not detected&quot; status? Only by trying with mjpeg-streamer? What does &#039;ls -l /dev/video*&#039; show?<br />- Last but not least: Try BB 14.07. USB Performance of the AR9331 has been improved in 14.07.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 23 Feb 2015, 20:49)</p>

					<p>Tmo26, no idea what Dlink did but from my experience i had fewer problems with usb devices on Dir505. Problems are usually with certain&nbsp; usb hubs on both devices. Dir505 has 8mb flash so usually all needed packages fit without use of hub.&nbsp; Have you ever managed to use more than one device on MR3020? Two, three webcams or wifi sticks?</p>									</div>
