					<p>Don&#039;t mean to be too snarky here, I started out buying a fairly cheap router (Linksys EA6200) that I had no idea I wanted to put non-manufacturer code on to begin with. But then I found out about fq-codel and I have an application where throughput latency just happens to be a really big deal. I&#039;d like SOME kind of GUI (or at the very least some decent docs on how I&#039;m supposed to survive without one!), kind of surprised that&#039;s considered &quot;demanding&quot;. Tried installing the EA6300 code (which the docs here say ought to work) and there was no GUI visible so I restored to factory load. Went back down to the store and saw a TL-WR841 v11.1 for really cheap, looked like it was the answer and bought it but after loading trunk I&#039;m supposed to &quot;sysupgrade&quot; from a command prompt on the serial port (via the USB adapter, the usual way) and for some odd reason sending &quot;tpl&quot; doesn&#039;t get me that prompt (nor does anything else I can identify). Went back to the store and also &quot;in the cheap seats&quot; are an Asus RT-12/D1 and a D-Link DIR-605L. The Asus device page says &quot;wireless not supported at the moment&quot; and the D-Link is apparently built around a Realtek SoC that everyone hates (either it&#039;s not documented or the part doesn&#039;t follow what docs there are, I can only guess). It just seems peculiar that it&#039;s so hard to find a simple fairly low-throughput wireless router that I can purchase inexpensively, put your code on and expect it to work at least for a small demo, like I say though this isn&#039;t as much a complaint as seeking guidance about a combination someone knows will actually work, I fully understand as soon as someone &quot;gets the bugs out&quot; the manufacturer discontinues the model but where does that leave the rest of us...?</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe I HAVE to load trunk first before I get the Linux prompt but see all I wanted to find out was did I have everything hooked up OK and compatible, the factory load wouldn&#039;t give me that prompt, maybe I ought to have understood that was part of &quot;newer ones being locked&quot; (hadn&#039;t heard that either) so guess I&#039;ll see if that works first. </p><p>Yeah R6100 sounds like a winner - especially 128M/128M(! - I note it takes 18 watts to run as a result!) and only a single hardware version, and there&#039;s quite a few still on eBay pretty cheap.

					<p>OK on your advice I bought an R6100, almost everything is OK, yes it was only $30 and I&#039;m pretty impressed, it loaded the OpenWrt code first time LuCI and all. There are however some issues here, the Ethernet light on the Ubee cable modem only stays green, doesn&#039;t go to blue after the DHCP sequence finishes like every other router I&#039;ve tested. Much more important when I ran the dslreports speed test, the bufferbloat rating is &quot;F&quot; and I was seeing numbers over 1000 msec during the test which is at least 60% higher than the router I had and the reason I bought a different router in the first place to run CC (regardless of test destination). I&#039;m still sort of new at this but are there some configuration settings (maybe QoS or something?) that need to be applied to the new firmware load &quot;out of the box&quot; that will get this down, or is this all this HW is capable of, or are there still bugs in the code, does anyone know? This is the part that&#039;s pretty disappointing but I hope someone here has the answer, anyone?</p>									</div>

					<p>A big reason why the 6100&#039;s price is being slashed is that its ports are not Gb.&nbsp; Most modems indicate a GbE link by turning the light blue, that&#039;s not going to happen here.&nbsp; If your cable is faster than 50 Mb or so, this router may not be able to fully use it.&nbsp; But then neither would the TL-WR841 or the other bargain models you mentioned.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize you needed super high speed.</p><p>Luci-app-sqm is what I use with DSL, it can help latency a lot.</p>									</div>

					<p>I wouldn&#039;t say &quot;super&quot;, the cable probably delivers 59 MB and if I don&#039;t get quite all of it that&#039;s OK this is just a demo/learning exercise. But getting an &quot;F&quot; on bufferbloat, I thought this build had fq_codel? You&#039;re blaming the particular GUI (I guess, I can&#039;t tell for sure), you&#039;re recommending an alternate, I hope I don&#039;t have to write (or learn) makefiles and linker scripts and github? I&#039;m not sure I even understand the premise of &quot;packages&quot; are they like the Linux version of object files? I thought this was a bit more &quot;reduced to practice&quot; than this. An &quot;F&quot; out of the box, really? I was looking for something more like 40-50 msec and from what I&#039;ve read I thought I had every reason to expect just that. Can I get a little more light on this? Can anyone recommend some combination that will get me the numbers I&#039;m looking for or is this really completely unrealistic at this time?</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow the &quot;package list&quot; BEFORE the update was either really old or minimal, it didn&#039;t even have that package! First try I got a whole load of &quot;wrong signature&quot; messages but I guess I had something out of sync. Second try everything came in pretty nice, network tab now has the option as you specified, so I added one SQM rule, set 50 MBits down/4.5 up, rebooted and tried dslreports again. It&#039;s now testing about 72 down 8.2 up but the bufferbloat readings are still VERY high (over 1-2 seconds) and still &quot;F&quot; rating. </p><p>Gotta admit there&#039;s a lot more structure on this platform than I even imagined was in there, also I guess quite a lot that COULD be out of whack. I wonder how I&#039;m supposed to figure out whether there&#039;s another incorrect setting, possibly another missing package or both? Can&#039;t say that it bothers me a whole lot to have to &quot;do a little tweaking&quot; but I need for someone to tell me just what the &quot;universe&quot; of &quot;problem areas&quot; that I ought to look at would be, since as good as it is it still isn&#039;t as transparent as a development environment. Then again as I&#039;m sure you know even THOSE aren&#039;t always quite as transparent as you might WISH you had when the issues you&#039;re trying to resolve are kind of obscure and difficult to describe in and of themselves...</p>									</div>

					<p>OK here&#039;s a little more info, maybe someone can help me. Yes I was getting my bufferbloat results from the dslreports speed test, that&#039;s a little &quot;off purpose&quot; for me because it&#039;s all about internet speeds and overall buffering and may be influenced by other equipment like my cable modem (which happens to be a Ubee DDM352) or maybe even God knows what else in the internet system, what I&#039;m saying is getting that rating up would be beneficial but it really may not even be necessary. What I&#039;m trying to do is minimize the latency in a particular wifi connection, this occurs from a &quot;transmitter&quot; app that sends low-rate data from an iPhone and a &quot;receiver&quot; program running on Windows 7 that picks it up. I&#039;ve got Chaos Calmer 15.05 running on a Netgear R6100, I added the luci-app-sqm package and I&#039;m using the fq_codel queueing discipline with the simple.qos setup script. Apparently immediately after downloading the OpenWrt build the radio is off, I&#039;ve enabled it and the iPhone app finds the receiver but the latency appears to be just as bad as the Netgear factory code. What should I be trying to do to fix it and why am I not seeing better results than this since it really doesn&#039;t appear to be a very demanding application of the overall system?</p>									</div>

					<p>This is quite a puzzle to me mk24, I really appreciate your help in trying to map it out. The nature of the problem being addressed strongly suggests that there should not be a server &quot;in the loop&quot; because this isn&#039;t basically &quot;readily processable data&quot; but I could certainly be wrong. It occurred to me that perhaps the functionality needed could be accomplished by simply connecting the source to the destination over wifi in an ad hoc network, indeed some experimentation revealed that the iPhone WOULD connect to a netbook I have in such a manner just fine, but the app complained vociferously that it couldn&#039;t work because it &quot;didn&#039;t see a network&quot; (which I take to mean a router), so I wrote this approach up and sent the developer an email, however I&#039;m not expecting a quick resolution because he never responded to my last one. I do know iPhones can talk to each other over something called the multipeer connection framework but the developer may not have used it or been aware of it. (I also learned the PC program he wrote won&#039;t run on a PC that doesn&#039;t have iTunes installed on it because he links to a dll that&#039;s only provided by Apple.) As far as &quot;pinging&quot; the iPhone, after 4 tries it returns 1 ms minimum, 1965 maximum, 760 average, that&#039;s actually much HIGHER than using my unmodified Linksys which was averaging 65 msec and 119 max so now I&#039;m REALLY confused!</p>									</div>

					<p>Would you happen to know if it would perhaps be possible to have a special router software build where the amount of RAM dedicated for the queue buffers could be reduced (perhaps even DRASTICALLY) to accomplish the result I&#039;m looking for? It&#039;s only nice but not essential for the application I&#039;m looking at to handle general internet traffic at the same time as it makes this wifi connection. It just stands to reason that if there&#039;s NO OTHER way to accommodate this app, then if you simply don&#039;t have a whole lot of buffer space in which to allocate queues, then it&#039;s just about a tautological certainty that you CAN&#039;T CREATE HUGE BUFFERS WITH LONG DELAYS. Kind of an &quot;Occam&#039;s razor&quot; approach, frequently works OK if you don&#039;t cut yourself in the process! Or might this suggest there could be a somewhat more &quot;elegant&quot; approach (like maybe a different QoS strategy)? If it&#039;s possible with code edits what would be the scope of the changes, would it affect more than a handful of files? I&#039;m a zillion miles away from understanding how this code fits together but it&#039;s actually kind of small compared to some of the projects I used to work on, there again I&#039;m not up to date on the modern tools etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK let me try asking the question this way. I&#039;ve looked at the options under the so-called &quot;Basic Configuration&quot; tab, specifically the ones that don&#039;t appear until you check the &quot;advanced configuration&quot; or &quot;dangerous configuration&quot; checkboxes, and it&#039;s pretty apparent that I don&#039;t have any idea what I&#039;m looking at. Let&#039;s say maybe I&#039;m trying to devise some settings that specifically &quot;target&quot; the traffic I&#039;m interested in, maybe if I could identify this traffic and specifically prioritize it then I&#039;d have a chance at hitting the goal I&#039;m looking for. Or perhaps I can simply see to it that there just ISN&#039;T &quot;other&quot; traffic, maybe there&#039;s some way I can set this up that I can disable most of this buffering to arrive at a set of configuration settings that would work poorly for the &quot;general&quot; case but might suit my needs just fine. Can someone point me either at the options I ought to select, or at least at somewhere I ought to go to read up on how these things work and what I might be able to use them for? (If nobody knows how to help me with the advanced options then at least I could take some time getting schooled on how to help myself and MAYBE use the time at least somewhat productively.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Starting with the last issue first, as far as the cell data, the phone hasn&#039;t even been activated yet, there&#039;s hardly a possibility of that data path being used. (I&#039;ll have more to say later about the rest because it appears that a &quot;user&quot; has to become at least an expert in networking terminology just to resolve a simple transmission delay issue, but I&#039;ll just say for now that just does appear to be the industry norm right now which is kind of a shame.) </p><p>Let me ask for the resolution of a more pressing issue first. The entire organization of this buffer issue appears to be organized around the determination of parameters relative to the WAN port, specifically dealing with download (ingress) and upload (egress) speeds. My concern is about latency between a wired and a wireless device, and clearly neither of these involves the WAN. I&#039;m confused, does each &quot;device interface&quot; have separate buffers and independent ingress and egress buffer management parameters? In other words are all these parameters ONLY for managing just the traffic into and out of the WAN, and therefore my fiddling around with these settings really isn&#039;t going to have any effect on my problem by design? I&#039;m asking because I don&#039;t see enough independent adjustments to accommodate just all the different categories of devices (let alone all the devices independently), so probably I&#039;m wasting my time on this from the jump, is that true?</p>									</div>

					<p>Let me try this again, it&#039;s clear that I&#039;m struggling a bit here not knowing the precisely correct terminology to ask the precisely pertinent question, and until I ask the question PERFECTLY I seem to get nothing but disapproval and stony silence. OK I&#039;ve got an iPhone on wifi and I&#039;m trying to set up communication to a PC on one of the internet ports. I suppose from the standpoint of the architecture this communication isn&#039;t being &quot;routed&quot; at all, these ports I guess are &quot;on the same side&quot; of the &quot;LAN interface&quot;, so communications between them are simply &quot;bridged&quot;, so I suppose none of this elaborate software regimen for massaging buffer strategies applies. OK, got it I guess. Now calling this &quot;bridging&quot; is apparently designed to make it sound like this issue is &quot;no big deal&quot;, why the bridge is simply some docile, faithful little puppy dog, it does exactly what you want to do, no more no less. Well then how come this &quot;bridging&quot; results in AT LEAST A HALF-SECOND DELAY (on average) in either direction, there&#039;s clearly SOME kind of FIFO buffering going on between the ports, how the heck am I supposed to control and manage THAT?? I don&#039;t see anything around here even admitting that it occurs! What the heck is really going on, is that huge buffer just some &quot;artifact&quot; of everything else that&#039;s going on that I have no control over at all? If I don&#039;t care about WAN activity at all could I put the router HW into a different mode (maybe plug the PC into the WAN jack, heck I don&#039;t know) so I can get the box into a configuration where I&#039;ve got some parameters that I CAN control? And why does my question seem so unfamiliar to everyone here, is my &quot;application&quot; really THAT bizarre?</p>									</div>

					<p>A bridge is just a bit of code in the kernel that takes over several network interfaces and allows them to communicate directly with each other.&nbsp; It also creates a virtual interface where the OS can reach any of them.&nbsp; As I understand it, placing interfaces into a bridge is like plugging cables into an unmanaged Ethernet switch.&nbsp; The switch has a memory of what devices (MAC addresses) have been seen on each port.&nbsp; When a packet comes in on an interface, the destination MAC is examined and the packet is dispatched to the appropriate other interface.&nbsp; This is almost instant if the system is not busy.&nbsp; There is nothing to configure, other than turning on and off the STP protocol which detects if a loop has been formed, to prevent packets from needlessly and destructively racing around it.</p><p>The interfaces themselves still have their buffers, but the buffer will stay empty if nothing else is happening.</p><p>If I were you I&#039;d use a Linux PC with Wireshark to investigate exactly what the app does.&nbsp; Is it really only on the LAN or is it trying to go to the Internet?&nbsp; I have a setup that can answer that easily.&nbsp; It is simply a PC connected to a router and on to the Internet via Ethernet, and its wifi adapter is in AP mode.&nbsp; These are joined with a bridge in the kernel just like OpenWrt uses.&nbsp; On later versions of Ubuntu the &quot;network manager&quot; GUI can set all this up.</p><p>By connecting a closed-source device to that AP, Wireshark can see exactly what enters and leaves it, and when, and where it is going.</p><p>And again, there can be a lot of latency in a phone due to power-saving in the wifi radio.&nbsp; It would use a lot of the battery to keep the radio on 100% of the time ready to instantly receive a packet.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have trouble with your statement &quot;this is almost instant if the system is not busy&quot; because I have no knowledge of any reason the system WOULD be busy, unless I&#039;ve been hacked without my knowledge! I suppose I&#039;ll download some Linux OS later and see what it can show me, there&#039;s a pattern here though, the first transaction of a ping from the PC to the phone IS ALWAYS ALMOST instantaneous, then on subsequent transactions the delay becomes totally hideous (like 2 whole seconds), I don&#039;t need a Wireshark to show me the result of the ping of a bridged connection (unless I still don&#039;t get the concept)! I think I read somewhere the first transaction puts the connection information into a table then subsequent transactions complete by reading back the table to perform the operation. There&#039;s clearly more going on, SOMETHING is buffering this data for that period of time, so I suppose this &quot;story&quot; that &quot;it&#039;s just a bridge, it doesn&#039;t take any time at all&quot; MAY have been the case once upon a time but isn&#039;t any more. What remains is clearly a mystery, possibly one that this community is pretty much unaware of, so I guess until we can identify what&#039;s happening versus what we THOUGHT WAS SUPPOSED TO happen we can&#039;t expect to &quot;control&quot; this. So like I say can I set up this &quot;box&quot; somehow so I can make a connection from the iPhone coming through the wifi radio and send that to the ethernet wired connector going to the PC without ANY bridging and the associated buffering, ie using only this &quot;routing&quot; buffering that I apparently CAN control (after I learn exactly how)? And if so can anyone help me figure those settings out too? (Yes massive ignorance on display, but understand I didn&#039;t set out here to redesign the theoretical basis of Linux buffered networking, I came here AS A USER TO PLUG SOME STUFF TOGETHER AND MAKE IT WORK, jeez!)</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh one more, if the radio in the router is shutting off, where&#039;s the setting that keeps it on permanently, or how else can I circumvent that issue? (If I&#039;m reading correctly the output power is only 200 mw, even considering nominal PA inefficiency it&#039;s under a watt and it&#039;s running on an 18 watt supply so I&#039;m pretty sure nothing&#039;s going to overheat or anything.)</p>									</div>
