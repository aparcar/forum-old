					<p>You need a modem matching your ISPs capabilities at your location; the good part is that most modems are backwards compatible (and you almost sorted the options in correct ascending order, for the details of technical capabilities and expectable throughput wikipedia has a lot to tell).</p><p>Just in short, if all your ISP can offer you at your location would be one of the ADSL flavours, paying retail price for a VDSL2/vectoring modem (at retail prices a factor of 2-4) wouldn&#039;t really be worth it (on the other hand, even those can be bought for a fiver in the used market, so...). With technologies still changing (e.g. super-vectoring far at the horizon), it doesn&#039;t make lots of sense to overspend just in case (unless you&#039;re certain that $new_technology will become available to you within the next 6-9 months).</p><p>And yes, it does make a lot of sense to put the demarcation line between internet (ISP network) and your private LAN on your own hardware (own software), without resorting to kludges like double NAT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 1 Feb 2018, 01:06)</p>

					<p>&quot;in the UK&quot; I would guess that you should be happy with a BT homehub5a which is supported decently by lede* and should work with both ADSL and VDSL in the UK. Since AFAIK BT/Openreach are not quantitatively using vectoring you will not even need to try to get hold of a vectoring capable firmware. </p><br /><p>*) decently after you did the soldering to actually get a lede firmware installed in the first place, but then again there might be already flashed to lede devices on ebay...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes if you have your modem&#039;s login credentials, log in and check the signal status page.</p><p>Generally if you over-buy your modem will be able to fall back to a slower service / older standard if that is what is on the line.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>VDSL is seldom installed in rural areas since though it newer and much faster than ADSL, it can only work through a few hundred meters of wire pair back to a phone company device.&nbsp; ADSL can go for kilometers.&nbsp; VDSL is very practical for apartment buildings.</p>									</div>

					<p>The UK has VDSL, although it&#039;s often called FTTC (fibre to the curb, but VDSL/ VDSL2 over copper from the curb (or rather the SAI cabinet) into the house).</p><p>The VDSL2 capable BT Home Hub <strong>5</strong> Type <strong>A</strong> should be a decent choice for that, but be aware to read its wiki entry before buying one. Given this thread, I doubt you&#039;d be comfortable with doing the initial flashing yourself and would recommend looking for one preflashed with LEDE instead (as using that avoids soldering and can be sysupgraded as needed).</p>									</div>
