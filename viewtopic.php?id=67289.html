					<p>I recently compiled the trunk and flashed it for my Raspberry Pi 3. It boots, but this file is missing and I can&#039;t connect to it via ethernet as there is no IP. </p><p>Also, I tried to create the file, but it says the filesystem is read only. So, I&#039;m at a standstill.</p><p>Can anyone help? What info can I post that would help?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s full suppport of pi 3 yet, but there could be something wrong just with the current revision of trunk, so you so can try some older revision before compiling like<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before=&quot;2016-08-15 00:00&quot; master`</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>I will try that if I can&#039;t manage to salvage the current install. According to this page on the wiki (wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi?s[]=raspberry&amp;s[]=pi&amp;s[]=3) The RPI 3 is included in the trunk.</p><p>UPDATE: I was able to remount the filesystem as rw and was able to create the config file. I manually typed the contents of the file from the Chaos Calmer system. After a reboot, I now have IP addresses. I can ping them and I can ping 192.168.1.1 with only my laptop ethernet cable connected directly to my raspberry pi. I don&#039;t know how to mark this as resolved, but I think it is. I don&#039;t know what else may be wrong, but this seems to be fixed.</p>									</div>
