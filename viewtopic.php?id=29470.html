					<p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR-1043ND which has the latest Backfire (10.03.1-rc4) and a Epson TX200 multifunctional printer. I could use the printer, with p910nd package, which ran smoothly. But I couldn&#039;t use the scanner. </p><p>So, I installed sane-libs, sane-backends, sane-frontends and xinetd. All configuration was done in sane, but there wasn&#039;t any sane-find-scanner tool. I tried to find any kmod-usb-scanner, but no success. Scanimage -L doesn&#039;t find any devices, and I tried saned -d128,. </p><p>I can print with it, and lsusb show this line: Bus 001 Device 004: ID 04b8:0849 Seiko Epson Corp.

					<p>Curious, did you find anything on this?&nbsp; I had a long post about getting this to work in White Russian, and found a post that someone else made it work with the 2.6 kernel.&nbsp; Maybe need to find a backported &quot;kmod-usb-scanner&quot; package?</p>									</div>

					<p>I could configure xinetd and all the USB drivers, so now I can use my USB scanner with my wifi router, and it wasn&#039;t that dificult... It wasn&#039;t necesarry to have a kmod-usb-scanner package, for example.</p>									</div>

					<p>@oddballhero, I just hit your problem. I already opened a bug report in openwrt that might interest you:</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16770#ticket">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16770#ticket</a></p><p>For network usage of sane, I created a workaround that uses a script to wrap saned call from xinetd.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#
# When a SANE scanning occurs, /dev/usb/lp0 is lost.
# Reload usblp after the scanjob is finished in order to
# recreate /dev/usb/lp0 
#
/usr/sbin/saned &quot;$@&quot;

rmmod usblp
insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/usblp.ko</code></pre></div><p>It could also be used for scanimage (if you need to run it inside the router, in a cgi page for example).</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>oddballhero wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>Pilot6 wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>sm_kemp wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Forget it, I just made sure all the usb packages were installed, now its working.&nbsp; Thanks!</p></blockquote></div><p>Which packages you installed to get scanner work?</p></blockquote></div><p>Running Backfire 10.03.&nbsp; Just followed <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/p910nd.server">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/p910nd.server</a> (so for me it looks like ohci, ehci (usb 2.0), usblp, all the sane packages and hplip which installs cups - tried to remove cups but scanner stopped working so just kept but does not need to run), and scanimage works pretty well but interestingly, after scanning, can&#039;t print with p910nd.&nbsp; Have to reboot, then can print to p910nd.&nbsp; Conversely, printing to p910nd does not affect scanimage.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
