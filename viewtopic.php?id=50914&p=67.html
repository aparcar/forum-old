					<p>lately noticing wifi issues in few latest builds, getting some dropouts so decided to do clean upgrades to newest revision using tftp.I tried r45144 and after flash would not work.Then i tried flash r45077 and it booted but complete failure as none my wifi drivers working.So then i decided fall to r45001, at 1st it didn&#039;t detect my 5g wifi but after reset it worked.Noticed missing tor features and also mac address override not been working either.Maybe this new kernel is not so well for my router.<br />I am using netgear wndr4300 .. clean flashes done using tftp<br />as far any more diagnostic info, can&#039;t say much more .. sorry not much of help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hello community !</p><p>first of all , thank you Arokh for your wonderful work ....</p><p>my (short) story : i spent days to choose a router (prereq : no external antenna to be WAF) and i finally purchased a Netgear 6250 as i saw it was supported in ddwrt .. once received i realized it was not a full support and the AC was clearly not managed , after spent other days i refund it and replace by a WNDR3700 V4 as supported by both ddwrt and OpenWRT</p><p>Once received i tried ddwrt but disappointed with wlan support (my iDevices could not connect to 5Ghz but laptops could), i gave up and decided to jump to OpenWRT and finally found this thread and your amazing work Arokh !! it was a couple of weeks ago</p><p>i don&#039;t remember what was my first build but after my first soft brick (i deleted an interface accidently) i had no choice to try another release , i was soft bricked by the last one as other people and finally installed build 44915 , it work like a charm and i don&#039;t see necessity to upgrade</p><p>i hope you will forgive me but i have few questions ... (you can believe me i am a pure geek so i can help as well)</p><p>Q1/ i see the WNDR4300 is supported , i am still in grace period with amazon so i can refund my 3700 for free , can i expect same level of support with OpenWRT and WNDR4300 ? there is only 10€ of difference so i can do the gap without concern</p><p>Q2/ the archer C5 is same price as the wndr4300 , is this model working fine with Arokh build ?</p><p>Q3/ out of the box , VPN server is not fully working : tunnel is made but client cannot surf , workaround i found is to replace<br />dhcp-option DNS 10.1.1.1 by dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8 , am i missing something ?</p><p>Q4/ also i cannot surf with Tor once on VPN despite i changed option to 1 on config file and reboot</p><p>Q5/ i successfully created a VPN client (router to HMA) is anyone can point me through a tuto which explain how create a wlan interface for this connection ? (in other words i would like to replicate what exist for Tor by this client VPN)</p><p>thank you for reading</p><p>Arokh : beercard ? postcard or Paypal ?</p><p>XT</p><p>EDIT : for the Archer C5 users : can we remove the antenna or arrange them to not be visible (put them at 180° behind) and still have &quot;decent&quot; wifi perfs ?</p><p>EDIT 2: maybe worth to note : Netgear has recently released a new firmware for the WNDR3700 , previous release was made more than 1Y ago</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>extenue</strong> on 1 Apr 2015, 22:48)</p>

					<p>You can remove antenna&#039;s from the Archer C5 if you only use 2.4GHz, if you want to use 5GHz, removing the external antenna&#039;s will lead to very bad reception and putting them at 180 degrees should be pretty doable.</p><p>VPN works great here with the default config (without TOR, don&#039;t need it and didn&#039;t test that). I have a WDR4900 though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 1 Apr 2015, 23:26)</p>

					<p>I found the issue with the default config, seems the blank lines in my UCI script caused an issue. I think that might have been caused by a recent change in the uci code, because it&#039;s worked fine until recently.</p><p>Here&#039;s a fixed build: <a href="http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/wdr4900_noipv6/test/r45227/">http://enduser.subsignal.org/~trondah/w … st/r45227/</a> tested and works fine here with reset settings.</p><p>New builds incoming, doing a full clean hopefully the ar71xx softbrick goes away too.</p><p>@extenue</p><p>Yes, setting option tor 1 in /etc/config/openvpn and rebooting should make VPN traffic pass directly to Tor network.

					<p>@arokh , ok i will give it a try and let you know</p><p>@all , forgive me i am still a noob with the very basics ...... i fully understand it&#039;s best to NOT keep settings during upgrade (or downgrade also i guess) ok but does it mean that each time we need to manually re-enter all our config ? (SSID , static lease , hostnames , DDNS , firewall rules , ....) or something exist to avoid that ? </p><p>can we use backup / restore config ?<br />what is the difference between backup / restore config and &quot;keep settings&quot; during a flash update ?<br />or is all custom settings are stored in plain text so we need to do some copy and paste after the flash from previous files saved ?</p><p>Thanks,<br />XT</p>									</div>

					<p>@bouwew</p><p>There was one blank line that I overlooked in my UCI script. I&#039;ve removed it and started a new rebuild. I have tested r45250 for the wdr4900 and can confirm that it&#039;s resolved. A clean flash results in good settings just like it should.</p><p>@extenue</p><p>You can re-use my UCI script located at /rom/etc/uci-defaults/99-arokh to recreate your own personal settings after a clean flash. In most cases you can actually sysupgrade with keeping the settings, but some times I make changes to the default services that won&#039;t&nbsp; work if you do.</p>									</div>

					<p>arokh,</p><p>Thank you very much for the good firmware, my router is WNDR3700V1, and I am still running your r41534 build. It is working great except the 5G wifi signal is a little weaker.<br />Since the router is quite old, do I really gain anything if I flash it with your new build?<br />If it worth a flash, is there a build more stable please?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Yardern</p>									</div>
