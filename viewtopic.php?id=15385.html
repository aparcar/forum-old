					<p>I have a Linksys WRT54GL router and one PC connected to its LAN port and an Acer 5520G notebook connected via WiFi. Router is connected to my ISP by 100Mbit UTP, aquiring it&#039;s IP by DHCP and then establishing a PPTP link to the Internet gateway. So, the PC works fine. But the notebook often (about every 5-10 minutes or less) reports &quot;hardware failures&quot; while pinging some address in the Internet (I used ping for diagnistics, the browser and other software just report timeout errors). It may begin at any moment, last for some minutes, and then revert to normal operation. Running tracert reports failure at the first hop, where the router IP must be seen. At the very same time, LAN works okay and pinging notebook to and from the PC shows no errors, I can see shared folders, get files and so on, so this is not notebook&#039;s WiFi problem obviously. Please anyone give me some advise what to do, as WiFi becomes useless with this router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
