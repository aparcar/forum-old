					<p>Hi,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I have bought TL-WA830RE to install openwrt into it. Unfortunately it is V3 and there is no corresponding image to download. Does anyone have made a build for V3? Otherwise if you can help me building the image for V3 (any guide doc). Also, it is possible to install custom image meant for any other hardware into this?<br />Thanks,<br />Pronoy</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all, I&#039;d also want some info about this model V3 revision.<br />I recently ordered a TL-WA830RE and got V3 version, which I didn&#039;t even know it existed, since there&#039;s barely no info about it anywhere, so I started digging and found this post.<br />The only info I&#039;ve found about it, apart from this post are:<br />forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66563<br />and <br />dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1047845&amp;highlight=#1047845<br />(cant post links, so you&#039;ll have to copy and paste, sorry)</p><p>I know almost 9 months have passed since Pronoy wrote this post, so I guess there&#039;s absolutely no support for this device, but I have to try. <br />Please, somebody answer, even if it&#039;s to say &quot;there&#039;s no way to do it&quot;, before I try to return this AP to Amazon &gt;.&lt;</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />____________________<br />Edit:<br />Also found that it has the same chipset and similar hardware as wr841nd V10 wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd, maybe this can help</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mamahamam</strong> on 25 Jan 2017, 18:23)</p>
