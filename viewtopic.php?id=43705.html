					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have been using hotplug2 for about a year now. When i first installed it, i wrote a simple rule for setting the correct permissions to my scanner.<br />--------<br />#!/bin/sh</p><p>case &quot;$ACTION&quot; in<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PID=`cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/$DEVICENAME/idProduct`<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VID=`cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/$DEVICENAME/idVendor`<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ &quot;$PID&quot; = &quot;3434&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$VID&quot; = &quot;04e8&quot; ] &amp;&amp; chown :sane $DEVICE &amp;&amp; chmod 660 $DEVICE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;;</p><p>esac<br />--------</p><p>this worked for me pretty well until i run an update last week. It seems that the variable $DEVICE is no longer available. As the version of hotplug2 did not change, it has to rely on something else. Well, after some time i decided to use udev instead of hotplug2.<br />Udev still accepts the old rules which i once wrote for my computer: <br />#/etc/rules.d/15-scanner.rules<br /># Scanner<br />ATTR{idVendor}==&quot;04e8&quot;, ATTR{idProduct}==&quot;3434&quot;, MODE:=&quot;0664&quot;, GROUP:=&quot;sane&quot;, ENV{libsane_matched}:=&quot;yes&quot;</p><p>but there is need to write an init script to start udevd:</p><p>#/etc/init.d/udev<br />#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common<br /># Udev<br /># Dont forget to chmod +x /etc/init.d/example! <br /># /etc/init.d/example enable start script automatically on boot</p><p>START=20</p><p>start() {&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo start<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # commands to launch application</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #Start udevd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /sbin/udevd --daemon</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #Let udev recheck devices<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /sbin/udevadm trigger</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #Wait for udev<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /sbin/udevadm settle</p><p>}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>stop() {&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo stop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # commands to kill application<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Needs an equivalent to killproc udevd<br />}</p><p>with this script, udev is working and recognizes the given rules.</p><p>Well, the shown scripts are very simple and not complete (i.e. i still need to know how to kill the udevd thread at &quot;stop&quot; ) but for first it is working as it should.</p><p>cheers</p>									</div>
