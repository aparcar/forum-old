					<p>Hello OpenWRT,</p><p>I might be in the wrong corner of the internet, but I figured this was the place - if it exists - to ask my question.</p><p>See, I&#039;m working on a project using 2.4 GHz microwave Dopplar radar for the purpose of heartbeat detection.&nbsp; The technology is feasible, and many projects exist using custom hardware.&nbsp; There are other projects which use modified PC Lan cards, and other hardware.&nbsp; We&#039;d like to do this without performing a hardware modification on a consumer level wireless networking product.</p><p>Is it possible to get raw signal from a consumer level bluetooth/802.11g chip using custom firmware?&nbsp; More likely than not, a custom firmware will be locked to a certain brand and model wireless chipset.&nbsp; This is also something I would like to avoid.&nbsp; In this case, is it possible to get a raw signal using a custom driver?</p><p>What I don&#039;t need is information about other devices and internet connections.&nbsp; I need to send out a ping, have it reflect off of a surface with varying intensity, and receive it on the same hardware.&nbsp; I need the incoming raw signal - not data packets or anything specific about networks.</p><p>I don&#039;t need exact specifics on how to do these things...&nbsp; Just advice on where I could look to enable this functionality, and if it&#039;s feasible without hardware modification.</p><p>Thanks for your time and expertise,</p><p>-Griff</p>									</div>
