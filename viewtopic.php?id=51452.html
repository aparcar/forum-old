					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>This is my first post here, and unfortunately its a question.</p><p>I&#039;ve been searching the forum and the internet for an integrated solution regarding my need: baby monitor (audio and video) to be seen/heard in an Android device.</p><p>I already have video thanks to mjpg-streamer. From what I&#039;ve read using GStreamer will be too much for my router.</p><p>Nevertheless I consider audio more important and if I can&#039;t have both at least audio... So my question is how to use the mic input from my usb soundcard (using a mic) and stream the audio to a - lets say - android device?</p><p>I can only find &quot;players&quot; that use the usb soundcard output instead of the line in and then stream the sound over the lan/wan.</p><p>Cheers and thanks in advanced!</p>									</div>

However it will almost certainly use less power than your router+webcam setup.</p><p>Phones are designed to be as power efficient as possible to make the battery last, routers are designed to operate off a socket at all times. Thus a phone, typically uses &lt;0.01 watts while idle, and no more than 3-5 watts <em>maximum</em> while doing everything at once. Routers often use between 5-10 watts while <em>idle</em> and up to double that when busy. Hence, I never bothered going down the router route so I know fairly little about it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d get a IP camera integrated into your local network and on the other end I&#039;d use a Android smartphone with an App for it. That&#039;s the easiest way to go :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, it was not the answer I was expecting <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I can configure the Android video down to 1 FPS and drastically reduce the video size I can have better battery duration and less heat.</p><p>The thing is IF I only had this setup: openwrt router, webcam with mic and or usb soundcard with mic and stream the audio.</p><p>I will try to find a way to do so and if I find it, I will post it here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I thank you all for your time.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Luis</p>									</div>

If you want a near-realtime reliable stream.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The best solution I found for realtime audio streaming is FFmpeg as it can stream via rtp nativley, with no need to use FFserver. I used the following command:<br />Code:</p><p>ffmpeg -f oss -i /dev/dsp -acodec libmp3lame -ab 32k -ac 1 -re -f rtp rtp://234.5.5.5:1234</p><p>. This is similiar to the VLC command, except that this time I am converting into MP3 and streaming to the address: rtp://234.5.5.5:1234. Once again, all you need to do is enter rtp://234.5.5.5:1234 as the streaming source in VLC. There are a few huge advantages with this method, first, the CPU usage is only about 25% on my naff little 750Mhz Transmeta Crusoe. Second, multiple clients can connect at once and third, it seems rock solid. I have had this command running for three days straight with no problems. Memory usage seems to creep up over time, but that&#039;s about all. I get a delay of roughly 1.5 seconds, but this does not change over time.</p></blockquote></div><p>I will try this and will give you an update.</p><p>As I mentioned before using my mobile phone and drasticaly reducing frame rate and resolution I solved the heat issue and at the same time I won battery life. Of course, an android mobile phone can be connected to a switching power charger and it will use very low power.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>
