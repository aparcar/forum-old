					<p>Hi,</p><p>i want to instal OpenWrt on an TP-Link TD-W8961NB Router, to have an Router with a linux konsole, that i could access from SSH. First, i didn&#039;t know what image to use. The Router offers a&nbsp; web interfacce where i could upload firmware updates. But i don&#039;t what image to use because i don&#039;t which chip set it has. I tried with the broadcom facctory image (because a lot of TP-Link routers seem have broadcom chipsets, as i read) but if i tried to upload it to the web interface, a message box appeard saying (i don&#039;t know the words exactly) that the image is wrong (without any further information).</p><p>I looked to the Website of TP-Link where Images are to download. I renamed the OpenWrrt-Image like the Images which are to download from TP-Link and tried to update the firmware again (with the OpnWrt-Image). Now not a Message Box appeared, but in the website an eror was shown, that the image was not accepted by the router.</p><p>Now i opened the case of the Router and looked for an interface, where i could connect with an serial adapter and where i possibly get information about the router or can access the router. Now, i found two sets of four buttons (marked in the picture, see <a href="http://postimg.org/image/5jdd4i4mx/).">http://postimg.org/image/5jdd4i4mx/).</a> To get the right PIN, i followed the instructions on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/port.serial.</a> I used a voltage meter and measured the resistance and voltage between the ground (from the power supply where i connected it to the router, i alwas used the black probe on ground and the red on the pin) and the pin. The router was always on.</p><p>All Descriptions from top to down, i have the following results:</p><p>First group, solding would be required to connect (has &quot;J2&quot; printed to it)<br />- First hole (a square is drawn around it): <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; not connected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.37 V<br />- Second hole: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; not connected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.05 V<br />- Third hole: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.8 kΩ (not constant, from 2.6kΩ to 4.5kΩ) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.05 V<br />- Fourth hole: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; not connected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.32 V</p><br /><p>Second group, unpopulated holes where i could connect pins<br />- First hole: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; not connected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.4 V<br />- Second hole: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; 100Ω (Ohms, not kΩ)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.025 V<br />- Third hole: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; not connected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;not constant, goes from 0.02 V to 0.04 V<br />- Fourth hole (a square is drawn around it): <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resistance:&nbsp; &nbsp; not connected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Voltage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;not constant, goes from 0.03 V to 0.03 V</p><p>Because the first group of four pins is a group of unpopulated holes in the pcb where i could not insert a connector (because they were soldered so i could not connect a connector without soldering it to it) i used the second block. I connected a </p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.de/USB-TTL-Konverter-Modul-mit-eingebautem-CP2102/dp/B00AFRXKFU/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402751004&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=usb+ttl">http://www.amazon.de/USB-TTL-Konverter- … ds=usb+ttl</a> </p><p>to the usb port of my computer (using Ubuntu 13.10) and installed screen. Than i connected the RXD Pin of the converter to the third pin, the TXD Pin to the fourth pin and the Groud to the second pin. I looked into /dev and found an interface ttyUSB0. I switched as root to /dev and typed (on my Ubuntu PC):</p><p>#screen ttyUSB0 </p><p>But there was only shown an empty screen, no data that came from the router (if there was any data send). I switched on the TTL-Adapter the Cables for RXD and TXD and tried again, but the same result.</p><br /><p>Could you help me? What can I do?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmwifi</strong> on 14 Jun 2014, 17:06)</p>

I could not find chipset information about it. Does this mean that i never can install any operating system on it, because there is even no space where i could write the os?</p><p>I will try if i can get something with the command you proposed, thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried with different baud rates (on GtkTerm) but i can not get something to read on the display. I used Port two (from the holes where i could place pins, trom top to down) as ground and the second and third as RXD und TXD. I tried switching RXD and TXD, but i got nothing to read. Do you think im right with those pins?</p>									</div>
