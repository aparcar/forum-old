					<p>I read in multiple places about the &quot;30/30/30 reset&quot; practice.<br />That is, I don&#039;t see it described here (OpenWRT) but there is poeple talking about it.<br />I remember with my old WRT610Nv1 I had to do it from time to time, especially with <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/30/30/30_method">DD-WRT</a>.<br />A few questions:<br />1. Is it needed with OpenWRT? With my 1043ND it&#039;s never been needed with either firmware.<br />2. What&#039;d be the purpose of holding a button during the power off?<br />3. Which routers/firmwares need this practice?<br />4. Why it&#039;s not mentioned in the Wiki?</p><p>TIA.</p>									</div>

					<p>This sequence probably triggers an nvram reset in DD-Wrt followed by a reboot, I never bothered to look into the actual implementation.<br />The reason it has no effect on OpenWrt is that we do not implement any kind of default reset button action (apart from the failsafe trigger in preinit).</p>									</div>
