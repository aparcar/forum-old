					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have recently setup a series of WRT&#039;s and WRAP boards with OLSR and documented the procedure here: <a href="http://www.bewifi.org.au/index.php/OLSRHowto">http://www.bewifi.org.au/index.php/OLSRHowto</a></p><p>I installed Chillispot and configured it but I&#039;ve just realised. If Chillispot is installed on each gateway and you are roaming, a problem lies when switching from one gateway to another you are going to be prompted to enter your details again and that will throw out any connections you had established. Is there anyway the daemon&#039;s can work together to keep active sessions?</p><p>Or can anyone suggest a different method of authentication that might work OK in this scenario?</p>									</div>

					<p>still working on a dependency issue, so I do not have the personal experience yet, but with x-wrt there is a webif-mesh-hotspot-setup package....&nbsp; I do not understand what it is about chillispot that would make it the jealous god? maybe with more info we can come up with a solution.<br />-tom</p>									</div>

					<p>belrpr:<br />Thanks for your comments. im a bit gray on what chillispot does compared to wpa ent w/radius and other 802.1x solutions - hoping this thread can clarify a bit in the realm of chillispot/olsr. I think one chillispot with wired APs misses at least one maskedau&#039;s goals (and mine) - to elim the need for every AP to be a wired gateway.&nbsp; </p><p>For my implementation, there would be many wired gateway nodes, but even more unwired router nodes. The &quot;mesh&quot; is not stable and I would like each node to be part of the AAA rather than rely on a particular node - this is where I though chillispot would have an advantage, but allowing each node to AAA regardless of the other nodes. </p><p>A second goal of mine and perhaps of maskedau&#039;s as well is for a unique captive portal page for each node - this is what I actually thought chillispot does, to have the page hosted locally on the node and pass the AAA to radius. Or is chillispot just a 802.1x client? If that were the case than oslr would prose no inherent challenge???</p><p>thanks again, tom</p>									</div>
