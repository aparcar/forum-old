					<p>Hi!<br />I&#039;m in need of some help to choose hardware on which to run OpenWrt. I&#039;ve read through old posts and I know that this question comes up quite often, but I couldn&#039;t find any good recommendations from the last couple of months, and I guess that things change quite fast.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m planning on buying new hardware to replace my current wireless AP and server (mostly used as a fileserver). My requirements are:</p><p>* Draft-N.<br />* USB (v2) connectors (at least one) to hook up an external harddrive or two.<br />* More than one ethernet-port (100mbit is fine).<br />* Enough space to be able to install samba, webserver (apache?) and a bittorrent client.<br />* Enough processing power and memory to be able to run a few bittorrent downloads (at least at a few MB/sec).<br />* As easy to use with OpenWrt as possible, preferably as easy to install as uploading a new firmware using TFTP.</p><p>I have no idea how much processing power and memory this might require, but hopefully you know more about this.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Alexander</p>									</div>
