					<p>I&#039;ve been playing with the AR7 port on the Netgear DG834.<br />By adding some padding and then putting on a header right at the end of the firmware, I can get the router to boot into openwrt.<br />The header contains a checksum that is validated by the DG834 version of Adam2.<br />Unfortunately the checksum is computed over the flash used by jffs2 and hence becomes wrong after the router has booted.<br />In other words the router will only boot once.<br />I can&#039;t figure out how to get around this without flashing a different version of Adam2.<br />I&#039;ve tried playing with the partition table but the checksum location appears to be hardcoded.</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rdb</strong> on 20 Aug 2005, 00:35)</p>

					<p>I solved this issue by buying a dsl-504t...<br />This just worked with the firmware that was generated by default.</p><p>I used adam2 ftp interface to flash the combined kernel+fs squashfs firmware on both routers.<br />I used a serial console to see what is going on and to set the mtd variables.</p>									</div>
