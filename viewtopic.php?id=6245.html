					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am working on the integration of support for GO7007 chipset into kamikaze for at least Asus WL-500gP (and possibly Linksys WRTSL54G). This is the chipset used for instance in the Plextor ConvertX PX-TV402U that I have.</p><p>You will find all the information I gathered so far and what has been done on my wiki webpage:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/GO7007">http://wiki.openwrt.org/GO7007</a></p><p>So far video works fine using Video4Linux2 API but I am running into a problem with the ALSA OSS emulation used for audio interfacing with the GO7007. I never really played with ALSA so I am learning at the same time I am debugging.</p><p>Basically I am having a &quot;no such device&quot; error whenever I open the device file. I checked the drivers linkage under /proc and /sys and everything seems in place. I am guessing that the built-in ALSA support in kamikaze is missing some support for interfacing this driver. For instance it only includes usb-audio board support, maybe something needs to be added there.</p><p>If you are interested please read my webpage and let me know if you need any additionnal information (and I am sure you will), I will post them to the webpage. If you have both a Plextor ConvertX and and USB2 WRT-supported router give it a try. If we ever go through we can have a cheap streaming solution that would stream/multicast DivX/MP3 (or more conventionnal MPEG4/MP2 inside a MPEG-TS mux) over your LAN.</p><p>Also I am no specialist about licensing (GO7007 driver is Open Source Software) so if anyone spots a problem somewhere please let me know.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Romain</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RomainDeparis</strong> on 26 Jun 2006, 04:54)</p>

					<p>Hi Romain, your doing some very interesting work. I would love to use the ffrecord program (<a href="http://colabti.de/convertx/">http://colabti.de/convertx/</a>) on a openwrt device. This way one could build a very simple and cheap media center. </p><p>Now i have to dare to try it on my Asus WL500g.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Romain,<br />I just want to let you know that i am also working on this combination of devices (Go7007 + Asus-WL500gP). For the time beeing i am just interested in pure video streams. Can you perhaps help me to get &quot;spook&quot; going. I managed to make it compile, posted the package files to your wiki page also. But currently i lack the V4L2 headers, the autoconfig check does not detect V4L2 so it falls back to V4L. </p><p>However, thanks so far for the hints on how to compile the modules!!</p><p>Kind regards,<br />Tom</p><p>Solved:<br />V4L2 was detected after setting the path to the kernel sources and enabling the V4L2 flag. See and edit wiki for more ideas on that topic.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Tom</strong> on 10 Oct 2006, 18:59)</p>
