					<p>I think it&#039;s a good idea to check and analyse what&#039;s going on inside cbi.lua.<br />There are the default validate and write functions defined. <br />You also need to look for cfgvalue function. It needs to be redefined when reading data from config file.<br />The needed parameters handed over by cbi to the functions.<br />So look into cbi.lua for the various objects. and analyse code of OpenWrt LuCi applications.<br />That was the way I started rewriting luci-app-ddns.<br />Good luck.<br />Christian</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry Folks;</p><p>Solved this problem and, forgot to share solutions.</p><p>Boils down to two points:</p><p>1) how to selectively control CBI control display (during rendering)<br />A: use .depends, eg:</p><p>y = s:option(ListValue, &quot;region_CA&quot;, &quot;Select Province&quot;)<br />-- Creates an element list (select box)<br />y:depends( {country=&quot;CA&quot;} ) -- Only displays if country=&quot;CA&quot;</p><p>2) how to access control selection as variable:<br />A:<br />g = s:option(Value, &quot;receiver_email&quot;, &quot;Receiver Email Address(es)&quot;); g.optional=false; g.rmempty = false;<br />local receiver_email = &quot;&quot;<br />function g:validate(value)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; receiver_email = value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return value<br />end</p><p>And, for those who are attempting a config identity page for entering country, region..., working code here:</p><p><a href="http://www.rossco.org/Files/identity_tab.lua">http://www.rossco.org/Files/identity_tab.lua</a></p>									</div>

					<p><a href="http://www.rossco.org/Files/identity_tab.lua">http://www.rossco.org/Files/identity_tab.lua</a></p><p>I updated the linked file (identity_tab.lua). It is functional, but suboptimal. Please refer to this to understand the following questions:</p><p>1 ) The config values are (eventually) ending up in a C struct, so, I needed to check the field lengths.<br />object:maxlength = n does nothing. object.maxlength(n) has nil exception. So, had to use validate: <br />function a:validate(value)<br />&nbsp; if ( value ~= nil ) and ( string.len(value) &gt; 15 ) then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; return nil, translate(&quot;Name maximum length = 15&quot;)<br />&nbsp; end<br />&nbsp; return value<br />end<br /><strong>Question: How to use maxlength?</strong></p><p>2) I have two dropdown list boxes to select State / Province (region) which depend on countries US / CA respectively. I have a textbox for entering region if country is not US or CA. This results in three config variables: region_US, region_CA and region_other in the config file.<br /><strong>Question: how can I prevent (mutually exclusive) region_US, region_CA and region_other variables from being written to config file and write the active region_X variable as region variable in config file?</strong></p><p>3) The region_other control depends on country NOT being US or CA, so, has a depends list of the hundred or so other countries, very cumbersome and wasteful.<br /><strong>Question: how can I override the .depends function to remove all previous depends from list? (so I can use a single depends to display control or not)</strong></p>									</div>
