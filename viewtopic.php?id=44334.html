					<p>This is my first topic so please excuse any mistakes such as wrong category.</p><p>The thing is I tried to solder wires on my tp-link 703n in order to get a serial connection. I followed <a href="http://forums.openpilot.org/blog/52/entry-92-unbrick-wr703n-wifi-router/">this</a> guide&nbsp; and everything went well. But when i tried to power on the router it doesn&#039;t start. No blue led, nothing. </p><p>Would you be kind enough to give me any piece of advice? Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the same issue.<br />Firstly, it worked very well, i got accsess to console by serial, but when i closed case, it stopped working, LED is not blinking now.<br />Using multimeter, i can see that internal voltage regulator gives 1.5v instead of 3.3v.<br />If i connect power using this serial line (3.3v), then router starts booting, but after all reboots due to lack of usb2ttl adapter&#039;s power.</p>									</div>

					<p>I followed the same guide as topic starter, except that i put VCC to LED2 + pad, because it is easier to solder. Btw, it worked for some time in this configuration until i closed the case.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here are some images taken with my camera which is not that great.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www2.picturepush.com/photo/a/13316960/img/Anonymous/P1010047.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www5.picturepush.com/photo/a/13316973/img/Anonymous/P1010060.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www5.picturepush.com/photo/a/13316978/img/Anonymous/P1010045.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>Also, I mention that after soldering the wires, I tried to power on the router but with no success. Quickly I de-soldered all the wires. I never tested it with my serial to usb (DKU-5 cable, if that matters).</p><p>I found that is not a 703n but a 702n <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; &nbsp;The two wires,black and red are there because of a mod: I added an internal battery, bst-38 model made by Sony ericsson. With a bit of sanding on the upper blue plastic, it fits perfectly for an autonomy of a few hours. You can also see the switch I fitted instead of the usb connector.</p><br /><p>PS: problems with my internet connection is the issue for the long reply.Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dany_mid</strong> on 14 Jun 2013, 23:38)</p>

					<p>Well well well......I found the problem! it&nbsp; was a small piece of solder that made contact between 2 pins of&nbsp; the RAM.<br />If anybody wants any more details related to the battery mod, just ask here what you want: pictures instructions or any bit of information.</p><p>Thank you everybody for your help!</p>									</div>
