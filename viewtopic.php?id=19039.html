					<p>Hey all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My old pantech from my work broke and they gave me a sierra c597(that&#039;s usb). I have a pcmcia to usb adapter and OpenWrt sees it fine, but no matter what i try, can&#039;t get OpenWrt to see the c597. I&#039;ve tried many firmwares and packages and editing of configs. Been reading all the forums i can all weekend. currently i&#039;m running kamikaze/8.09_RC2/brcm-2.4/ with the pcimcia, usb, and sierra packages installed. Best i can figure, it&#039;s because the c597 has the auto load of drivers and dialer built in that works fine on windows but won&#039;t let it init. I found some post talking about a patch that will make it do this...</p><p>UNUSUAL_DEV(&nbsp; 0x1199, 0x0fff, 0x0000, 0x9999,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Sierra Wireless&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;USB MMC Storage&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; US_SC_DEVICE, US_PR_DEVICE, NULL,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; US_FL_IGNORE_DEVICE)</p><p>I have zero experience with patching a kernal, but i have heard it talked about and understand the concept, i just have no clue how to do it. I tried a few patchs i found that said it would do that, installed the patch package but it would always give me errors. I&#039;m thinking that it&#039;s because the patches i&#039;ve found are for patching the source before you build the image. But i have even less clue how to build my own image. I looked through the SDK and buildroot howto&#039;s but it was over my head. does any one know an easy way to get the c597 to work on OpenWrt. if not, can any one help me getting an trx image, package, or kernal patch complied that will solve this issue? i think this...</p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/11909">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/11909</a></p><p>is what i need. I just have no clue how to take what&#039;s on that page and applie to the firmware. </p><p>thanks.</p>									</div>
