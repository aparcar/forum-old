					<p>Hi<br />I&#039;m trying to port openwrt on this device, but accidentally bricked the bootloader config. The bootloader works, but hangs after image is downloaded via tftp and programming to flash doesn&#039;t start.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for someone with the WHOLEFLASH dump from this device. I would be very grateful.</p>									</div>
