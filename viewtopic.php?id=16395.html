					<p>To load OpenWRT you are not required to use JTAG as Compex Myloader V2.40 or above is already support OpenWRT </p><p>So what you need to do is to Check whether your loader version is Compex Loader V 2.40 (Now should be V2.43 that already able to Support kamiakze 7.09 ) at 22 July 2007 <br/>So if Already V2.4x then you may load you firmware by using TFTP . </p><p>If not please provide you serial plus all information needed to the Support or you will need to waste your time for this info again. </p><br/><p>HOW IF YOU DON HV SERIAL CONSOLE&nbsp; ? (Take it easy) </p><p>1. Go to the loader/firmware mode <br/>[Press and hold the reset button then power on, the diag led will blinking]</p><p>2. then go to the same directory then do the tftp <br/>[TFTP -i 192.168.168.1 firmware.bin] <br/>[192.168.168.1 is default frimware mode IP] </p><p>3. Wait <br/>[The dig led will steady on now. Wait for 1 Min the diag led will blinking again] <br/>[If your diag led never steadly on mean the firmware is not loaded to the device then you may try it again]</p><p>4. After blinking, you may restart your device.</p><p>Now check ur IP and set to 192.168.1.2-254 [192.168.1.1 = default ip]</p><p>Telnet to 192.168.1.1</p><p>Done if you see OpenWRT logo. </p><p>If not but a serial console to see what is going on. </p><br/><p>END </p><br/><br/><br/><p>IF YOU HAVE SERIAL CONSOLE ? (More easy now) </p><p>1. Put in the serial cable n everything </p><p>2. you may follow above method by go to the loader/firmware mode by pressing n power up the device <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; OR <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Keep Pressing &quot;ESC&quot; button when the device is boot up until you see the &quot;boot menu&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You will see this <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; ================================================================<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; MyLoader version 2.43.0706<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; System memory: 16MB</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Probe Flash Device: 00400000 at bfc00000<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Flash Device: Found 1 x16 devices at 0x0 in 16-bit mode<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Amd/Fujitsu Extended Query Table v1.1 at 0x0040<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; number of CFI chips: 1</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Flash memory: 4MB<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Update Firmware (Image Mode)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mini TFTP Server 1.0 (IP : 192.168.168.1)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Usage (Windows 2000/XP) :<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tftp -i 192.168.168.1 put &lt;filename&gt;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ================================================================<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; or This <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; ================================================================</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Main Menu</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 - Load Firmware<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 - Load Program<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 - BIOS Setup<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 - Fdisk Utility<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 - Update Flash (Binary Mode)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6 - Update Firmware (Image Mode)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; 7 - Reboot System<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; 8 - Memory Test<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please select :&nbsp; <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; ==================================================================</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; IF YOU GO SEE THE &quot;MAIN MENU:&quot;&nbsp; dont worry u just need to choose option &quot;6 - Update Firmware (Image Mode)&quot; <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then it will go to the &quot;Update Firmware (Image Mode)&quot;&nbsp; (like above:)</p><br/><p>3. then go to the same directory then do the tftp <br/>[TFTP -i 192.168.168.1 firmware.bin] <br/>[192.168.168.1 is default frimware mode IP] </p><p>4. Wait n see the serial console<br/>[After everything is trasfer and uploaded successfuly you will asked to reboot the device] <br/>[Now check ur IP and set to 192.168.1.2-254 [192.168.1.1 = default ip]</p><p>5. Telnet to 192.168.1.1</p><p>Done if you see OpenWRT logo. </p><p>If not = Impossible </p><p>Done </p><br/><p>SO JTAG IS NOT NEEDED AT ALL. <br/>JTAG is only needed when your loader is corrupted, as long as loader able to boot up serial console is sufficient enough.</p><br/><p>[Info taken from Compex Support]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DD7</strong> on 22 Jul 2008, 06:59)</p>
