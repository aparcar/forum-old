					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I just made the leap from DDWRT to OpenWRT, as it seemed that it offered better compatibility/stability for my router.</p><p>So far, the difference is night and day.. OpenWRT is smoking DDWRT in terms of performance and stability. Overall the config has been easy, but I&#039;m having trouble with the setup of a VPN Server/Service on it.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried following the guide titled &quot;Openswan Xl2tpd HOWTO&quot; and I get stuck installing the kmod-crc-ccitt package.. I get this error:</p><p>Unknown package &#039;kmod-crc-ccitt&#039;.</p><p>It looks like there might also be a typo in the list of required packages.. &quot;ipsec-tools we&quot; &lt;--- the we generates an error.</p><p>I&#039;m running Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 on a TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1</p><p>My goal is to setup a VPN service that I can use to dial into my home network.. ideally using a VPN client that&#039;s already built into Windows.</p><p>On DDWRT I was using the PPTP VPN service.. I figure now that I&#039;m reconfiguring things for OpenWRT I&#039;d use the opportunity to get away from the older, insecure way I used to do things.</p><p>Can someone point me in the right direction here?</p><p>Thanks!!</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t use IPsec but the package you want is likely kmod-lib-crc-ccitt.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s a typo.</p><p>No idea what the &quot;we&quot; after ipsec-tools is, can&#039;t help you there.</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like the write up I was using doesn&#039;t apply to Chaos Calmer.</p><p>Chaos Calmer uses strongswan, and the document I was looking at uses openswan... so I&#039;ve got to back up a few steps here..</p>									</div>
