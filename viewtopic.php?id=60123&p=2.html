					<p>Hi everybody,<br />I just bought the AR150 and I would like to set up the router to have the wifi turned off at certain times of the day.

					<p>One word of caution, the hardware pinout of the 10pin header has changed slightly (possibly in a hardware revision i guess). The GND pin next to the 3.3v pin is now a 5v pin. There are some other slight modifications as well (such as a smaller ram chip), but the 5v pin change is particularly important (at least to me! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p><p>This one is the PoE version (or the one with the PoE module pre-installed really). I was expecting this to be a normalish/cheap 24v passive poe module, but it is in fact a 48v fully compliant 802.3af PoE module which is quite nice.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/takigama/glinet_ar150_gps_daughterboard/master/GL150_pinout_change/IMG_20170608_214517_ws.jpg" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/takigama/glinet_ar150_gps_daughterboard/master/GL150_pinout_change/IMG_20170608_214517_ws.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Probably worth contacting GL.inet including the details of your purchase before doing anything else.&nbsp; </p><p>You do not say what firmware you have tried specifically but this link is to the firmware that should have been factory delivered:<br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar150/v1/">http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar150/v1/</a><br />Use the 2.264 version at this point.&nbsp; You may have received inventory that is back a few digits.</p><p>The good device, when connected to the internet, should actually tell you there is an upgrade available and you should be able to install this from the WebGUI.&nbsp; Indeed you should be able to go back and forth between firmware&#039;s directly from the WebGui (Gl.inet or Luci) and, barring issues, not really need the u-boot console.&nbsp; I do not suggest development versions for many reasons.</p><p>If you want firmware without the GL.inet GUI (which is especially good if you want to use the device for travel) there is also a gl.inet &quot;clean&quot; version here: <a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar150/clean/">http://www.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar150/clean/</a><br />and a LEDE 17.01.4 here: <a href="https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.4/targets/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.lede-project.org/rele … x/generic/</a> (search the page for ar150)</p>									</div>
