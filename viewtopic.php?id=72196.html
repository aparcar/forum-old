					<p>Hello,</p><p>On my Zyxel NBG6716, I have OpenWRT 15.05.1 running successfully. Now I&#039;m trying to get Wifi Protected Setup (with push-button connection) going, but it does not work.</p><p>I have configured three SSIDs: one 5GHz (private), one 2,4GHz (private) and one 2,4GHz (guests). The guest-one is the one I configured to be WPS-able using the physical button on the device.</p><p>I followed the setup instructions, removing wpad-mini, installing wpad and hostapd_utils. The hostapd_cli command is there, but gives the following output when I try to push the button from the commandline:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# hostapd_cli wps_pbc
Selected interface &#039;wlan1-1&#039;
FAIL</code></pre></div><p>I also have put in a system-log-entry for pushed and released buttons; the &#039;wps&#039; button is correctly detected and logged as such. So, the physical button seems OK:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# logread | grep user
Sat Sep 30 15:02:55 2017 user.notice root: the button was wps and the action was pressed
Sat Sep 30 15:02:55 2017 user.notice root: the button was wps and the action was released</code></pre></div><p>Can you help me get my WPS going?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Frans-Willem Post<br />The Netherlands</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fwpost</strong> on 1 Oct 2017, 18:42)</p>
