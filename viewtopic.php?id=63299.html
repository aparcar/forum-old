					<p>Hey there,</p><p>I have a TP-Link WDR3600 with an OpenWRT system on it.<br />But it&#039;s a a custom version of OpenWRT made by airfy ...</p><p>The only possibility to access the router is the failsafe mode... but always i do a firstboot, there is no terminal output and after a reboot it&#039;s the same like before...</p><p>So my questions:<br />- How can I clear the complete router?<br />- Where are the files, i have to delete, that the router don&#039;t go back to airfy configuration ?</p><p>- Is there a chance to copy files via telnet or maybe even a possibility to flash the router with only a telnet connection?!</p><p>I hope you understand my problems ... my english is not very well <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />If there are any German geeks, i would be glad about an answer </p><p>Greetz<br />TechnoTroll</p>									</div>

					<p>But all these solutions will revert you back to the config included in the flashed firmware. It that is faulty, reverting will not help you much.</p><p>If you have console access via telnet or SSH, you should be able to download via scp or wget. And use the sysupgrade command to flash a new clean version.</p>									</div>
