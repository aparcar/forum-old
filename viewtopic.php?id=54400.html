					<p>Hello OpenWrt Community,</p><p>Forgive me if this has been covered in a previous post but I have searched and have become more confused.</p><p>My current network setup is that I have a Sagemcom router/modem as my primary router/AP as it connects to the internet (it&#039;s the router needed for my ISP). All my wireless devices (phone, laptop, printer, etc.) connect into this network.</p><p>I just received a printer that is older and not wireless (but is ethernet ready) that I would like to add to my network. The issue (and reason for this post) is that it&#039;s in another room, far way from my router so there is no ability to connect to the LAN ports. I read all the posts about installing OpenWrt on a router to be able to facilitate bridge mode that will allow me to connect my printer to this router and of course bridge the traffic to my primary router. I have a DLink DIR-825 B1. I successfully installed OpenWrt (which is exciting, backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-dir-825-b1-squashfs-factory.bin) but now am totally confused as to how to set this up. I understand the concepts of bridging but am confused by the various documents I found relating to configuration. I would like this printer (and any other device I connect to this router) to be part of my overall network.</p><p>I found this document: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#usingrouting">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/rou â€¦ ingrouting</a> but got hung up on setting the 825 in station mode. I&#039;m in the GUI for the OpenWrt config and have enabled Wifi but don&#039;t see Station mode. When I look at the Wifi modes (under Interface Configuration) I see: AP, Client, Ad-Hoc, 802.11s, etc. Is there some other place to set this mode? I can see the Wifi Status says &quot;Mode: Master&quot; but am baffled as to how to change this via the GUI. I have looked but can&#039;t find anything. Or is this an outdated document? I found the ability to join my primary network but have not a clue if this is correct or how to configure both networks. :-S</p><p>If I can get past &quot;station mode&quot; does the above noted document give me everything I need (like do I have to disable the firewall, wireless encryption/password between routers etc.) or is there another document that more readily explains how to configure the router for this setup? i also came across this download and don&#039;t know if I should update OpenWrt with this. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077.</a></p><p>Or maybe bridge mode is not what I need. Please advise.</p><p>Thank you in advance for any clarification you can provide. If more information is needed about the setup let me know.</p><br /><p>Thanks.</p><br /><p>Karen</p>									</div>
