					<p>Hello, I tried to use VIRTUAL NETWORK INTERFACE with 802.11 network.<br />Based on this web page(http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw/vif/), we can use mac80211 Multiple Virtual Interface(vif) with one physical wireless network card.</p><p>I used N150UA usb wireless network card and recent version of linux kernel(3.14). I can create virtual interfaces(vifs) with iw command line tools. However, only one vif can associated with AP. </p><p>I think it is limited by my wireless network card.</p><p>So, does anyone succeed associating multiple APs with VIF by using iw command?<br />If so, please let me know which wireless network card used.</p><p>Also, are there list of devices which supports those functionality.</p><br /><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>
