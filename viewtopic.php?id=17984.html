					<p>Good day everyone,<br />Recently I&#039;ve been thinking of manufacturing consumer grade routers that come with OpenWRT preinstalled. I&#039;m here to ask if anyone has any previous experience with the matter, no piece of information is useless right now.</p><p>So far, I&#039;ve been looking at a few Broadcom and Atheros chips (couldn&#039;t find any info on the pricing) but they seem like the main contenders.</p><p>Again, if you have any ideas or information on the matter just share it could be very valuable down the line.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would prefer Broadcom over Atheros chipset. While on the subject, please design your router with USB2 ports and at least 8/32MB Flash/RAM.</p>									</div>

					<p>someone else has already asked this forum what features they would like in the perfect router for openwrt.&nbsp; like you, I&#039;m too lazy to search for that thread. good luck with your manufacturing project</p>									</div>

There&#039;s dozens of manufacturers listed there. No big brands, all cheap and cheerful Chinese companies I would guess. Then again I doubt any of the big brands would do anything but break wind and press delete on any inquiries of this sort.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DaBigMac</strong> on 12 Dec 2008, 03:26)</p>

That said, one can always get he real router, with the intended chipset, to play with.</p>									</div>
