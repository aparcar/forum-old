					<p>I have looked over the packages available currently, and have seen nothing that provides an FTP server with a LuCI front end for administration.</p><p>I have the Netgear WGT634U and am running stable on 8.09 RC1 with UPNP and WiFi working. I wanted to know if anyone was aware of a package in the works to add an FTP server. As I have a USB 2.0 port on my router, I would love to set it up via the GUI and by able to use it.</p><p>Granted, I could set it up using available packages by coming in over SSH and editing config files, but I was hoping for something that was more user friendly for others in my household. LuCI has proved to be real hit for administering the router in terms of easy-to-use.</p>									</div>

					<p>Figured I&#039;d *bump* this thread and see if I&#039;m the only one still wanting an FTP server for LuCI.<br />With a 4gb USB stick plugged in to the routers USB port, I&#039;d love to be able to upload file to the router&#039;s storage space for retrieval later.</p>									</div>
