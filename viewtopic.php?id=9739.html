					<p>The problem is indeed in &quot;udhcpc&quot;. On every DHCP renewal, it calls an external script to do some stuff. Here is a snippet from &quot;udhcpc --help&quot;:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>-s,--script=file&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Run file at DHCP events (default /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script)</p></blockquote></div><p>So this file is run twice on DHCP renewal which triggers the following two events:<br /> * deconfig - the wan interface is brought down<br /> * renew|bond - the wan interface is brought up and IP configured</p><p>The above happens even if the IP does <strong>not</strong> change (which is not very clever).</p><p>All connections drop because OpenWRT uses MASQUERADE by default for NAT - MASQUERADE forgets old connections when interface goes down.</p><p>If your IP address does <strong>not</strong> change often, it&#039;s better to use SNAT which does not drop connections if the interface goes up/down for a short period of time and your IP address is still the same.</p><p>My solution was to use the hook which OpenWRT developers left in &quot;/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script&quot;. On &quot;renew|bond&quot; if a user script named &quot;/etc/udhcpc.user&quot; exists, it is called. So here is what I put in &quot;/etc/udhcpc.user&quot;:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>#!/bin/bash</p><p>echo &#039;Custom SNAT (disabling default MASQUERADE which drops connections on every DHCP renewal)&#039;<br />/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -F zone_wan_nat<br />/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -I zone_wan_nat -o &quot;$interface&quot; -j SNAT --to-source &quot;$ip&quot;</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
