					<p>I am using Arokh&#039;s build on my TP-Link TL-WDR4900 and with older kernels my extroot works perfectly fine by using this:</p><p>First by running this command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tar -C /overlay -cvf - . | tar -C /mnt/sda1 -xf -</code></pre></div><p>Then adding this to fstab:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config mount
        option target        /overlay
        option device        /dev/sda1
        option fstype        ext4
        option options       rw,sync
        option enabled       1
        option enabled_fsck  0</code></pre></div><p>And reboot, but with kernel 3.16 this at least doesn&#039;t work, I don&#039;t know if I need to use a different command, different config in fstab or if it is a bug, but I would really love to get this working. Anyone has a working extroot overlay on 3.16 and wants to share how he/she got it working?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 1 Nov 2014, 14:00)</p>

					<p>So no one here has had any succes with using extroot with kernel 3.16 yet? The configuration I posted in the OP works fine with all the previous kernels.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 2 Nov 2014, 14:43)</p>

					<p>While I am not a complete noob on OpenWRT, I have never tried or needed to do that, how do I do that?

I will do so tomorrow since I am running with 3.14 at the moment and have to leave in a bit.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan81</strong> on 2 Nov 2014, 14:56)</p>

					<p>Since Arokh mentioned that 3.16 is EOL I am not going to currently try it again, will try it with 3.18 and when I run into the same problems I will report back here with a full dmesg.</p>									</div>
