					<p>Hi All,<br /> Just installed 10.03.1-rc5 on my Dlink DIR-320 along with all the necessary USB / UVC modules to get webcam streaming happening. Managed to get my Logitech C170 streaming nicely through mjpg-streamer (awesome stuff!). Everything was pretty easy to get a picture up, but the problem I have now is that I need to set the &quot;power line frequency&quot; to 50hz rather than the default 60hz</p><p> Anyone know how to do this? A quick search around shows a few tools like v4lctl or libwebcam <a href="http://www.quickcamteam.net/software/libwebcam/">http://www.quickcamteam.net/software/libwebcam/</a> looks like they can do it, but I am not sure how to get the software onto the router..</p><p>Thank you in advance, you guys rock!</p>									</div>
