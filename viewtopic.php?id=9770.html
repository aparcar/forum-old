					<p>I have a V1 WRT54G, that normally gets about 1.2 MB/sec over wireless.&nbsp; I was able to get this after telling it to operate in &quot;G&quot; mode only in the Linksys firmware.&nbsp; I just flashed to RC6 (AMAZING, it kept all my wireless settings), but now I&#039;m back to 550 KB/sec again, the way the box was when running on a B adapter, or running the box in &quot;mixed&quot; mode.</p><p>Can I set RC6 to only operate in &quot;G&quot; mode, so I can get my speed back?</p>									</div>

					<p>I upgraded to 0.9 and installed webif2, I see the bandwidth graphs.. but something is still wrong...</p><p>Windows perfmon shows 200-300,000 bytes/sec going to and from my wireless NIC, and the Webif2 graphs show somewhere between 2 and 3 Mbps.&nbsp; I used to get 1.2 MB / sec (not Mb), with the stock firmware.&nbsp; Performance is also &#039;choppy&#039; - if I play a video over the wireless link, it has to keep pausing and buffering.</p><p>I&#039;m running WEP, if that matters.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>									</div>
