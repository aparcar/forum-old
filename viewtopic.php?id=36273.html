					<p>Thanks for the information, but I don&#039;t think you understood my question.&nbsp; I know how to setup the firewall without the user file; in fact, that is how I have mine running right now.&nbsp; What I&#039;d like to know is what difference configuring the firewall.user will make?&nbsp; How will things function differently?&nbsp; Is one setup more secure than the other? Why are the two setups different?</p><p>I don&#039;t mean to sound ungrateful, thank you for trying to answer my question.&nbsp; Perhaps I have misunderstood you.</p>									</div>

					<p>The first configuration of the road is different:<br />1) In the first configuration you marked that you use only the IPV4 with VPN connections. They are not at all chains iptables configured for IPv6. In addition, opened in interfejscie WAN UDP + TCP protocol, which means that you have configure OpenVPN to access the UDP or TCP because I have a firewall open.<br />2) The second configuration, in contrast to the first connection to the OpenVPN provides only after the protocol UDP. But the VPN connection can be made while the IPv4 and IPv6.<br />At the same time you have entries in firewall.user.<br />The first entry, this causes the NAT will not change packets reaching the port 1194 or OpenVPN. Generally I have been incidents. Often in ipsec on ??it because it looks Ads VPN packets to be changed by the NAT. This entry ensures that the NAT will not change the package will not interfere in it.<br />The last four entries allow for smooth movement of the tunnel to the OpenVPN server clientów.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rpc</strong> on 19 Apr 2012, 08:57)</p>

					<p>hi, ushlambad. <br />I cannot agree completly with rpc. </p><p>the first configuration is a openvpn-server in bridging-mode (tap-interface) so you only have to make the port of the openvpn-server reachable, the vpn-interface (tap0) is bridged to your lan-interface or lan-bridge so you do not need any firewallrules between your lan and vpn, and you cannot use any firewall on layer3 between them.</p><p>the second configuration is for a routed setup. the rule in /etc/config/firewall is again for the openvpn-server-port. <br />And in /etc/firewall.user: the first 2 lines aren&#039;t needed, they do the same as the rule in /etc/config/firewall, ok maybe they try to solve a non-existing NAT-issue with openvpn (this only applies to ipsec). you will be just fine only with the rule in /etc/config/firewall.</p><p>And I&#039;m not a big fan of using iptables-rules directly, because you have to know how iptables work, and you have to know which tables are used in openwrt. I remember there was a big change between kamikaze and backfire, which rendered many custom iptable-rules unusable. </p><p>So you should do it with uci-firewallrules only, and it&#039;s quite easy. </p><p>add this to /etc/config/network: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;vpn&#039;

					<p>Thanks to both of you.&nbsp; I am indeed running in bridge (road warrior) mode using a tap interface, so it sounds like configuring the /etc/config/firewall as per the first WIKI will suffice.&nbsp; If I comment out the line: </p><p>option &#039;family&#039; &#039;ipv4&#039;</p><p>will things work over ipv6, or do I add:</p><p>option &#039;family&#039; &#039;ipv6&#039;</p><p>Thanks again for the help, I&#039;m sure I provided a few laughs in return.&nbsp; I&#039;m clearly new to all of this, its nice to join a community of folks who are eager to help one another as opposed to one where people jump on you for asking a simple question.</p>									</div>
