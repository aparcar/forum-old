					<p>I agree with cmsigler about the wiki not explaining things fully and simply.&nbsp; I tried reading the wiki page (and other pages from other sources) to understand&nbsp; tagging -vs- not tagging and I still don&#039;t have a good sense of things.</p><p>Especially, what happens when a mixture of tagged and untagged packets are (a) coming in from a port and (b) going out to a port.&nbsp; At what point are tags stripped off and at what point are tags added?&nbsp; If a tagged packet comes in from a LAN port and the packet has a VLAN id of 1, but VLAN 1 is supposed to be untagged on that LAN port, what happens?&nbsp; Does the tag get stripped off? And if that packet goes to some other port on which VLAN 1 is configured as tagged, does the tag get added back at that point?</p><p>As an experiment I tried to mix untagged and tagged VLANs and could not make it work.</p><p>I set up two routers (different manufacturers) with a connection that each had two &quot;interfaces&quot; connected, one with an untagged vlan (using vlan ID 1) and one with a tagged vlan (using vlan ID 5) and it simply didn&#039;t work for me.&nbsp; I had thought that by default, untagged packets would go to vlan ID 1, and packets tagged for vlan ID 5 would go to vlan ID 5.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get it to work, so I gave up and tagged both VLANs.</p><p>In the &quot;Switch Documentation&quot; wiki page, I read that an explicit &quot;pvid&quot; (primary VLAN ID? port VLAN ID?) is used to indicate the default VLAN for a port, but the LuCI interface does not have a place to explicitly set the pvid, so I do not know if pvid is used anymore. I think the Chaos Calmer LuCI is pretty complete, so if pvid is not there I assume that it is not needed or supported.</p><p>Somewhere, I read that certain switches cannot work with tagged and untagged vlans on the same port.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember where I read that, and I cannot be sure if the problem is the switch, or the way I am configuring it.</p><p>I know for a fact that, by default, the switch configuration for a Western Digital MyNet 750 uses two vlans, ID 1 and 2, and for the CPU port, vlan 1 is untagged and goes to the LAN ports, and vlan 2 is tagged and goes to the WAN port.</p><p>But that is the configuration file /etc/config/network.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if the actual switch is set up that way, or if it just &quot;knows better&quot; and converts the CPU port on vlan 1 to be tagged.</p><p>[EDIT]&nbsp; I just did a &quot;swconfig dev switch0 show&quot; and at the bottom I see the following, which makes me think that the config file doesn&#039;t necessarily match the switch:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>VLAN 1:
        vid: 1
        ports: 0t 1 2 3 4
VLAN 2:
        vid: 2
        ports: 0t 5</code></pre></div><p>and I confirmed that the /etc/config/network file does NOT tag VLAN1, port 0:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
        option name &#039;switch0&#039;
        option reset &#039;1&#039;
        option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;
        option ports &#039;0 1 2 3 4&#039;
        option vid &#039;1&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;2&#039;
        option ports &#039;0t 5&#039;
        option vid &#039;2&#039;</code></pre></div><p>[End of EDIT]</p><p>I also know that the CPU tagging isn&#039;t necessarily part of the switch tagging.&nbsp; So, pretty much - I do not know much about how tagging actually works in terms of default VLAN ID, and how tagged and untagged packets are handled when they move through tagged and untagged ports.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Narrowband</strong> on 22 Mar 2016, 17:34)</p>

This means vlan0 can be used as a VLAN within or between devices, but you cannot tag packets with it.</p></blockquote></div><p>This would make it seem that VID 0 could be the &quot;default&quot; or &quot;public&quot; VLAN on the wire, and any VID except 4095 could be the &quot;ghost&quot; VLAN.&nbsp; But I still don&#039;t know if that would keep the traffic invisible.</p><p>But I don&#039;t know the bit representation:&nbsp; is an untagged packet the same as a tagged packet with a VID of 0 ?</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Now I know.&nbsp; an untagged packet is NOT the same as a tagged packet with a VID of 0.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Narrowband</strong> on 24 Mar 2016, 04:18)</p>
