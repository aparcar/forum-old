					<p>&quot;How to use mtd to flash .bin files?&quot;</p><p>I know, the &quot;real&quot; answer to this question is: Use .trx files, not .bin files. However, I like upgrading my OpenWRT box using the .bin files from downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots - I don&#039;t need or want to set up a build environment, I&#039;m more than happy to benefit from others&#039; work!</p><p>Various posts, e.g. <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10806">2007-05-19</a>, give this command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd bs=32 skip=1 if=linksys.bin of=linksys.trx</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, as that post says, this (sometimes) results in mtd saying &quot;Bad trx header.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11304">Broadcom &quot;Everything you need to know&quot;</a> Howto has a very helpful discussion of the .trx format, but no info on turning a .bin into a .trx file.</p><p>The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-5e952119de60dd663b8846c769121f12bb055c73">FAQ</a> (also in the <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3474">forum, 2005-11-30</a>) says &quot;Converting the openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin file back to a trx is just plain ignorant.&quot; Not only is that rude, I believe it&#039;s incorrect - mtd will not accept a .bin file, due to the header.</p><p>I got openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin today, and used tftp to flash it (works great - hooray!), but it would have been much, much simpler to have used mtd.&nbsp; Using the info from the Howto, I looked for the .trx header, so that I could use dd to strip this down to a .bin file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ hexdump -C openwrt-wgt634u-2.6-squashfs.bin | grep HDR0
00020000  48 44 52 30 00 10 1d 00  99 e3 71 15 00 00 01 00  |HDR0.....ãq.....|</code></pre></div><p>Can that be right?&nbsp; The .bin header to be stripped is 0x20000 bytes (128kB), and not 32 bytes?&nbsp; Suddenly, I&#039;m not so confident that I&#039;ll have a working router after flashing...</p><p>See also &quot;<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11883">Bad trx header.</a>,&quot; which includes this tidbit of information:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>thepeople wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The ability to flash .bin images have been removed from Kamikaze, use the .trx to flash from the command line.</p></blockquote></div><p>Does that mean that mtd <em>used to</em> know how to skip past the .bin header, and then write the .trx to flash? Was that limited to 32-byte headers, or could it scan arbitrarily until it saw a .trx header?&nbsp; That seems like a simple bit of programming, and incredibly useful... Anyone care to fill me in on the reason for removing that ability?</p>									</div>

I guess that&#039;s my main point - if it&#039;s just a matter of stripping off everything leading up to the .trx header, why can&#039;t mtd do that?</p><p>*<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxGN29njs3Q"><em>Spoiler</em>: The movie&#039;s big finish</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Well, now that you&#039;ve overhyped everything and built it into a huge controversy -</p><p>The mtd util will blindly write whatever file you give it directly to flash, no questions asked. This is because not all platforms use the trx format, and it&#039;s also useful to be able to use the utility for other sections of the flash. A trx file starts with the characters &quot;HDR0&quot;, this usually starts at the 32 byte mark, but it depends on platform - you can&#039;t insist that any bin file can be converted into a trx by stripping off 32 bytes.</p>									</div>
