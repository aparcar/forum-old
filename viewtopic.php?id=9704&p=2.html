					<p>Dear hans,</p><p>Thanks for porting asterisk1.4.1. It&#039;s a great job definitely. Now i want a Web GUI with it but the patch missed the GUI part. And i find that it was so hard for me to patch it by myself after trying, so do you have a plan to update it?</p><p>Best Regards</p>									</div>
