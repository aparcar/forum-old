					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>First of all, &#039;m a huge fan of OpenWRT.&nbsp; Yesterday, I had fiber installed at home so my internet went from 20Mbps to 250Mbps instantly.&nbsp; The only downside of that is that my wireless network <em>(which was already old)</em> cannot keep up when downloading - a good problem to have. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; I was looking up equipment to replace my current network, but every time I find a router I like, I find that it <em>(or key parts of it)</em> are not supported by OpenWRT doesn&#039;t support most of the ones I am interested in.</p><p>I&#039;m looking to replace both devices with a single, fairly powerful Router.&nbsp; If it had ~20% more range that the WZR-HP-AG300H I currently use, I wouldn&#039;t need a repeater.&nbsp; I am not wanting to break the bank, but also don&#039;t want the cheapest thing; either.&nbsp; I&#039;d much prefer it be OpenWRT compatible, but if there&#039;s one you would suggest whose stock firmware is still solid and would be a good deal; that would be fine, too.&nbsp; Below is an overview of what I&#039;m asking followed by a list of how the network I&#039;m replacing is currently configured if it offers any details.</p><p><strong><span class="bbu">Overall, my questions are...</span></strong><br />1. What router <em>(preferably OpenWRT compatible)</em> would you suggest for my setup?</p><p>2. If said router may not offer ~20% more range than current primary, what would you suggest for compatible repeater? - OR - if the suggested router is capable of swapping antennas, which would you suggest?</p><p>3. Is there a specific (AC) wireless card I should get for best performance / range if needing to upgrade any?</p><p><strong><span class="bbu">Current Home Wireless Network</span></strong><br /><strong>Primary Router</strong>: Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H <em>(OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05)</em><br />Pretty much a typical setup...<br /></p><ul><li><p>Primary firewall</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>AP for 2.4Ghz &amp; 5Ghz A/B/G/N</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Forwards 42 ports to static ip&#039;d devices</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>OpenVPN host</p></li></ul><p><em>The current speed when connected to primary&#039;s AP via 5Ghz N from a frequent stop (couch), I can copy a single large file at ~4.1MB/s</em></p><p><strong>Media Center Repeater</strong>: Netgear WN2500RP <em>(Stock firmware (1.0.0.30_1.0.58))</em><br /></p><ul><li><p>Provides ethernet connections to a few devices</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Repeats WiFi on SSID that differs from primary&#039;s</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Uses NetGear &quot;Fastlane&quot; to connect to primary router.&nbsp; 5Ghz is dedicated to Repeater &lt;-&gt; Router traffic and 2.4Ghz dedicated to repeating WiFi</p></li></ul><p><strong>What Wireless Network is Used For</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>Providing internet to ~20 devices of all types <em>(Our house is ~2200 sq feet.&nbsp; Would prefer not having to use Repeater, but currently hardly can connect to primary router&#039;s AP from one end of the house)</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Streaming video files via smb share from server connected to primary via ethernet &amp; dedicated Kodi box <em>(Windows)</em> connected to Repeater via ethernet <em>(Slowest link is the &quot;Fastlane&quot; 5Ghz connection between the two routers)</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Copy of various files between laptop &amp; server</p></li></ul><br /><p>So... what do you think?&nbsp; Thanks for any suggestions!!</p>									</div>

					<p>And if you pick the ipq806x platform, I&#039;d recommend Linksys EA8500 over Netgear devices, as the former do not require fake partition trickery and boot a bit faster (not with the 17.01.0 release, but with the master snapshots they do).</p>									</div>
