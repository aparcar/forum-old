					<p>So what is the problem? Configure DNS of 2nd router as IP of the 1st. But you&#039;ll get double nat, I don&#039;t know, whether you want it.</p>									</div>

					<p>You want to configure it as a so called &quot;dumb AP&quot;.</p><p>* delete wan network interface.&nbsp; There is only one network in a dumb AP, the lan, which bridges everything together.<br />* move wan ethernet physical port to lan<br />* set lan IP to be in the range of your main router but not conflicting with any device<br />* set dns and gateway to the main router IP<br />* disable DHCP server both ipv4 and v6<br />* set up wifi AP, connected to lan conventionally.</p><p>Plug any one of the Ethernet ports into your existing LAN switch.&nbsp; The other Ethernet ports on your router will be bridged into the LAN and you can use them for wired devices as if they were additional switch ports.&nbsp; The dumb AP setup is completely dumb.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t translate or filter anything.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 27 Sep 2017, 18:05)</p>

					<p>It just creates wifi bridge to local network. So it doesn&#039;t play in routing, dhcp, just provides access to network via wireless interface. I didn&#039;t understand your question initially, because you wrote dns instead of dhcp.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 28 Sep 2017, 13:44)</p>
