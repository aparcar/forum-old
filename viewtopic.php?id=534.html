					<p>hmmm.&nbsp; i started this discussion in another thread, but I&#039;m restarting it here.&nbsp; &nbsp;earlier, I wrote...</p><p>....ntpclient. first, fix busybox to include adjtimex, by editing sources/openwrt/busybox/busybox.config and adding ...<br />CONFIG_ADJTIMEX=y<br />and rebuild your openwrt (make clean in the busybox dir, then make in the top should be sufficient), and download this new openwrt, also `make ntpclient` and ipkg install it.</p><p>now, per the readme on ntpclient, run<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ntpclient -i 60 -c 30 -h 192.168.0.1 | tee /tmp/ntp.log</code></pre></div><p>(replace that IP with your friendly neighborhood NTP server)</p><p>and then find rate.awk in the ntpclient source directory, and feed that .log file through it like...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ awk -f rate.awk &lt; ntp.log
delta-t 1500 seconds
delta-o 622716 useconds
slope 415.145 ppm
old frequency 0 ( 0 ppm)
new frequency 27206931 ( 415.145 ppm)</code></pre></div><p>(I did this on my build computer rather than the WRT).</p><p>Now, take the last value displayed, like 27206931, and put this in /etc/init.d/S90ntpclient ...<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
adjtimex -f 27206931                 
/usr/sbin/ntpclient -h 192.168.0.1 -s 
/usr/sbin/ntpclient -h 192.168.0.1 -l &amp;</code></pre></div><p>(again, replacing the IP&#039;s with the correct ones, and the adjtimex value with the one from rate.awk above)</p><p>*NOW* your clock should be right on the money, and ntpclient should run a phased lock loop to KEEP it that way. Check it in a few days with `date` against that of your NTP reference server.</p><p>-------</p><p>yeah, I wrote that, and I left it running...&nbsp; my clock has drifted several seconds, and still appears unlocked.&nbsp; ;-/&nbsp; &nbsp; FYI, I&#039;m using these instructions...<br /><a href="http://doolittle.faludi.com/ntpclient/HOWTO">http://doolittle.faludi.com/ntpclient/HOWTO</a></p><p>so, has anyone actually gotten this working?&nbsp; &nbsp;yes, I know how to pseudo-CRON a periodic rdate, I dislike that approach for various reasons.&nbsp; &nbsp; If ntpclient can&#039;t be made to work properly, it probably should be dropped from the distro.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem has nothing to do with adjtimex, neither the system call, nor the busybox utility.&nbsp; The problem has to do with the default maximum adjustment that ntpclient, by default, will allow.</p><p>From the ntpclient HOWTO:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If the frequency offset (absolute value) is greater than about<br />140 ppm (9175040), you have a problem: you may be able to fix it with<br />the -t option to adjtimex, or you need to hack phaselock.c, that has a<br />maximum adjustment extent of +/- 150 ppm built into phaselock.c (change<br />the #define MAX_CORRECT and rebuild nptclient).&nbsp; I&#039;d like to suggest that<br />you replace the defective crystal instead, but I understand that is rarely<br />practical.</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, the WRT54G(s) doesn&#039;t have a crystal, and the 1638400 figure you see in your logs is significant, because MAX_CORRECT is set to 250 (not 150 as the documentation says), and 250 * 65536 = 1638400.&nbsp; So, ntpclient is trying to correct for drift, by setting the frequency to the max that it will allow, which simply isn&#039;t enough to compensate. In short, the frequency counter in the WRT54G(S) drifts far more than ntpclient can correct for in its default configuration.&nbsp; I&#039;ve set my MAX_CORRECT to 1000, and after running for about two days, my wrt54gs currently is off by 55ms.&nbsp; Reviewing my ntp logs, I see that it has drifted back and forth several times from being slightly too slow to being slightly too fast, which is a sign that ntpclient is doing its job.</p><p>I have not looked into the kernel sources at all, and it may be possible that this&nbsp; &nbsp;amplified drift may be modulated within the kernel sources.</p>									</div>
