					<p>hi made my first tries with wgt634u router.</p><p>Accidently I made a broken image because svn download was corrupted and I forced building a litte bit (FORCE=1)<br />So all modules like usb_storage (i think there is one), madwifi-ng and so on is missing on box. </p><p>What I tried then was building an new image which i think is more complete and to recover image with the tfp <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing/TFTP?action=show&amp;redirect=OpenWrtViaTftp">poll</a> method on booting the box with no success. ended with timeout<br />also there is no tftp neither client nor daemon installed on box. And I can&#039;t install ipkg because theres no public server for wgt634u and im to lazy to configure one on my gentoo box.</p><p>I also looked for trx files but there are none in the bin dir and I can&#039;t select this format in menuconfig. Also converting is not explained.</p><p>So <strong>question</strong> how can I update/recover self-built firmware on wgt634u in best way?<br />Why are there no trx files build for direct flashing. Why are there no ipkgs build for kernel-modules like usb_storage a.s.o. (I have also played a little with handhelds.org and they built packages also for modules)</p><p>Please light me up!</p>									</div>
