					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using WPA w/radius, and already have authorization working, but my question is:<br />Does OpenWRT do radius accounting these days? Like, tell the radius server when the user logs on and off (the latter is what I&#039;m after, as logon I can already see by authorization).<br />I saw some posts from 2005 that openwrt does not support it, but am wondering about the current status.</p><p>If not supported out of the box, is there a way to still get it working with some modifications?</p>									</div>

					<p>@belrpr : do you have any documentation about this ?</p><p>Like siesop I have searched everywhere and I can&#039;t see any info.</p><p>On Kamikaze and WhiteRussian there is no information sent to the radius server about accounting.</p><p>The only way I have seen is using a captive portal, but when you have WPA &quot;Enterprise&quot; it&#039;s not really useful.</p><p>Thanks !</p>									</div>

					<p>I, at least, did not.<br />Which is a pitty, because accounting would be quite useful in a corporate (or in my case, educational) environment.</p><p>I don&#039;t think belrpr understood, basically it seems the nas binary does not support accounting.. like.. it does not send something to radius when a user logs off. I want it to work without chillispot/webinterfaces/whatever, just when a user logs on / logs off on the network.<br />Perhaps with an a non-nas setup it works (hostap), I don&#039;t know... Then again, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s possible to switch to something else in the first place (using wrt54gl)</p><p>Right now we just pull the logged on users every few minutes from the aps by executing &#039;wl assoclist&#039; remotely.<br />But that&#039;s not a real solution.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>siesop</strong> on 18 Mar 2009, 16:26)</p>
