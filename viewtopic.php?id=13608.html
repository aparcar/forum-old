Even when authenticated sometimes the device will fail to forward packets on to the bridge, and thus onto the gateway which causes timeouts. Also when downloading huge files, the first 10 megs or so will happen very rapidly, thereafter it will deteriorate to about 5 KB/sec, and then after about 15 minutes the device stops sending packets alltogether.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m experiencing similar behaviour, after a random time it fail to forward packets on to the bridge (WLAN -&gt; WAN) which is &quot;fixed&quot; for example by opening a ssh session in the Fonera (weird?).<br />Other than that, it&#039;s working pretty good.</p>									</div>

					<p>wiciu: The fon is modified, there is two antenna&#039;s on the device, so diversity should be on. On my un-modified Fon I indeed have those parameters for better reception, diversity tries to use the two antenna&#039;s that are &quot;existent&quot;, except antenna 2 is not an external antenna, so diversity would possibly cause the packets to be sent over the internal antenna and won&#039;t be strong enough to reach a client. Hence turning it off is needed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Trew: Yes, channel 3 was the last attempt before I switched that device back to 7.06 since that seems to be fully stable (as in, it won&#039;t randomly stop dropping packets). Channel 3 is not used by anyone else in the neighbourhood as checked with Kismet. The only channels used, and they are very weak signals are 11, 8, and 10.</p><p>I have been testing with a backup device, and I can get the problem to happen fastest when I connect to the device, and start downloading a large file. So this is not limited to just one device, it is happening on all of the Fons I own. For now I have switched my main devices back to 7.06. I am also building a trunk release, so hopefully I will be able to test that as well soon.</p>									</div>
