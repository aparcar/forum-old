					<p>I installed nbd&#039;s qos-scripts (0.5, and now 0.6). I am looking at qos-wan and can&#039;t understand whether VOIP class is getting any priority or not.</p><p>I see class:VOIP stanza and I added classify:VOIP:src=192.168.1.200 line (it is the ip of my ATA adapter). However, shouldn&#039;t there also be something like option:priority:VOIP line similar to all other classes? Or VOIP gets enabled for QoS in some other way?</p><p>Related question - what is the best utility in OpenWRT to monitor how much bandwidth is my voip traffic getting? I played with bwm - but it shows total traffic for the interface; and I am trying to see how much goes to voip vs ftp upload vs p2p</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
