					<p>Sorry for the stupid question, but I&#039;d rather be safe: </p><p>I have the miwifi mini with PandoraBox.</p><p>It works really fine with this firmware, besause I only use this part as an 5 GHz-accesspoint in the living room.</p><p>All my I-devices connect with over 83 Mbps - there is nothing to complain about - 100 LAN port or not.</p><p>Now a second miwifi mini is on the way to me.</p><p>I know, never touch a running system, but ... with the new&nbsp; miwifi (also with preinstalled Pandora Box) I would like to test the &quot;right&quot; Openwrt, particularly well to install the German language pack - I&#039;ve found none that works with Pandora Box.</p><p>Therefore my stupid questions:</p><p>1.)Is this version here (<a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ramips/mt7620/openwrt-ramips-mt7620-miwifi-mini-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … pgrade.bin</a>) the right to flash from Pandora Box to OpenWRT ? </p><p>Or have to take another one ? If yes - which ?</p><p>2.) Is there in the meantime an version with luci &quot;on board&quot; or trunk only ? <br />They are known problems with install the luci-package over ssh ?</p><p>I read that I must install the kmod-mt76 to activate the 5GHz WiFi.</p><br /><p>Sorry for questions but I just don&#039;t want to crash the part.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>einarmiger</strong> on 1 Dec 2015, 16:09)</p>

					<p>Grrr. I have built an image from svn a few days ago and flashed it over my previous install on Pandorabox (the reason for building my own is because I wanted Luci to be built-in).

					<p>Yes, I figured it out. Thank you for the reply anyway.

					<p>OK, at this point I think there&#039;s something wrong with the hardware. I flashed the buildbot shapshot of openwrt from 11/22/15 that I downloaded directly to the router with wget, and I get the same behavior. First blinks red at a moderate rate, then blinks red at a slow rate, then goes to solid red. If I press reset during the first blink sequence it goes to a very fast blink pattern, and remains there. It is unreachable at any address on any port in any of these states.&nbsp; </p><p>The original firmware can be flashed and runs; pandorabox can be flashed and runs; but openwrt vanilla fails to flash correctly.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>Nexion wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>stamasd wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>(edit) Ugh.

					<p>I figured out that there are 2 screws under the label on the bottom of the case - lift both ends of the label and you can remove those, then the case opens easily.</p><p>However getting the flash chip out is a completely different matter. I am experienced in soldering/desoldering SMD components, but this chip doesn&#039;t allow me to desolder it. I think that in addition to being soldered it has also been glued to the PCB, as even while heating all pins on one side to the point where the solder should be melted, I can&#039;t even insert the corner of a razor blade between the chip and the PCB. I think they went the extra mile in preventing unsoldering of the flash. I don&#039;t think it will be possible to remove the chip without destroying it... and the PCB as well, possibly. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
