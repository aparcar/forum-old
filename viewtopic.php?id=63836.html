					<p>So I&#039;ve been doing a bit of a project for my own benefit for a while now just mucking around with it. I was originally looking at monetizing it but it sounds like giving back to the community may be a better idea.</p><p>I&#039;ve been writing this project using PHP on the Xiaomi MiWiFi Mini (Has 16MB Flash, using just over 8 of it currently).<br /><strong>The goals:</strong><br />(very) roughly as follows:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Simple, the firmware should target the 95%, not the power-users</p></li><li><p>Minimal, remove anything that doesn&#039;t *really* need to be asked, don&#039;t give the user an overabundance of choices</p></li><li><p>Intuitive to use, no manuals and no online help, with minimal &quot;tips&quot; in the interface where required</p></li><li><p>Clean, based very loosely on Material Design</p></li><li><p>Mobile + Desktop, it shouldn&#039;t matter if you plug the device in and use a cellphone, tablet or laptop to set it up</p></li></ul><p>The central theme of the WebUI will revolve around &quot;<strong>naming</strong>&quot; of devices, I want to make it easy to label &quot;Bobs iPhone&quot; as such, and then only once you&#039;ve labelled a device can you:<br />* Statically assign it an IP address<br />* Port-forward to it<br />* Proritize traffic to it<br />* Block it completely</p><p>There&#039;s a couple of screenshots you can check out a little bit of what I&#039;ve done so far, both on PC and on Cellphone:<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/a/a0y1W">http://imgur.com/a/a0y1W</a></p><p><strong>What&#039;s working:</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>Main status page / overview / system &amp; connection health page</p></li><li><p>WiFi settings, sets both 2.4 and 5Ghz, encrypted or open</p></li><li><p>LAN, set the IP, dhcp scope changes with</p></li><li><p>Device Naming</p></li><li><p>Port-forwarding (Mostly - Can&#039;t remove them)</p></li><li><p>System upgrades (Wanting to further automate it so it could upgrade without user intervention)</p></li></ul><p><strong>What&#039;s still work-in-progress:</strong><br /></p><ul><li><p>Authentication, currently none</p></li><li><p>First-run wizard, needs to set root pw</p></li><li><p>Captive redirect, part of first-run, should redirect all HTTP traffic by default to router until the first-run is completed</p></li><li><p>QoS, want the user to select from drop-down list and &quot;prioritize&quot; one device for X period of time (Say 1, 4 or 24 hours)</p></li><li><p>WAN, the PPPoE and VLAN override is still a little rough and incomplete</p></li><li><p>Bandwidth usage, similar to Gargoyle in terms of &quot;how much has X used in the last 15m, 1hr, 1 day&quot;</p></li><li><p>Printer and HDD sharing, it&#039;s pretty low on the priority list to be honest.</p></li></ul><p>Having never really worked on anything like this, or collaborated with others (If it ends up happening), this has been and still is a massive learning experience for me, but after showing it to a few other tech-friends the feedback was outstanding.<br />My problem is I&#039;m hitting my own personal limits, the code isn&#039;t flawless, and I&#039;m finding I haven&#039;t got such abundant spare time currently compared to what I&#039;d like to finish it.</p><p><em>So, I need a bit of help.</em></p><p>Is there any interest in something like this?<br />Are people interested in it, both as a finished &quot;firmware&quot; product, or as a project to help contribute code to?</p><p>I sort of kept in mind that this could one day be used on other routers but the primary goal to begin with is most certainly these Xiaomi Mini routers.</p><p>Cheers</p><br /><p>Chill.</p>									</div>
