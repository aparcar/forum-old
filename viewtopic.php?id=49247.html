					<p>I want some changes in the source code. But I have no idea about how the config files is called in /etc/config/ . How the hostapd call the files in the directory? Or How the settings are applied into the system? Am I clear? Welcome for the discussion.<br />Is there anyone know some about this ? Please help me with some clue? Thank you in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wandy</strong> on 27 Feb 2014, 05:42)</p>

The passage is just some sort of introduction. What I want is how the uci system parse the config file in /etc/config/ and transform all these file into the config files of the system. I found the source code of UCI which is in C. I am reading it. Really a challenge for me.</p>									</div>

I am reading the /lib/wifi/*.sh scripts which I think parse the wireless configure file in /etc/config/wireless. But it is hard to catch the process.</p><p>Actually, I want to divide the option channel into two,channel1 and channel2 in /etc/config/wireless. Because the 802.11a and 802.11na work in the different frequency as 802.11b/g/ng does. If the wrong frequency is chosen. The router will be down. But the original interface just mix all the frequencies together. I just want to make a change about this. But I need the &quot;channel1&quot; and &quot;channel2&quot; parsed just the option &quot;channel&quot;. So I need figure out the parsing process of the configure file by the shell.Then I can make some change and make channel1 and channel2 parsed smoothly. Am I understood?</p>									</div>
