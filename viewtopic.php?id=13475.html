					<p>Hello,</p><p>last week I bought a WRT54GS_V2 from an ebay dealer. One of the first actions was to switch to openwrt rc6. It is working fine.<br />The only strange exception the distance is insufficient especially since the GS model is a &quot;speed booster&quot; with 35% more power.</p><p>Within the NVRAM I found the value wl_distance=500.<br />What is the unit of measurement for this value and what is the possible range ? (meter, feet, 1/10 milliwatt , 0-2000 ???)<br />Of course more milliwatts means an enlarged local distance.&nbsp; It is worth to mention I live in Germany, only 100 milliwatts<br />are allowed for me. Thus there is a restriction for wl_distance isn&#039;t it ?</p><p>Zwiebel</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>This is the distance in meters. It changes the ACK timing.&nbsp; You need this if your client and AP are really far from each other.&nbsp; Radio waves are taking a longer time to travel so the Wifi devices need to take this in account. This has to be adjusted on both AP &quot;AND&quot; client sides.</p><p>If you want to increase the distance, you first need special antennas with higher gain.</p><p>Elv</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>thank you elv.<br />I think about a cheap workaround for my neighbour and me to share my DSL.<br />We plug a long USB repeater cable into his PC to decrease the distance between the USB WLAN stick at the end of the cable and my AP.</p><p>Zwiebel</p>									</div>
