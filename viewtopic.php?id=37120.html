					<p>Hi!</p><p>I built OpenWrt for this router. It has the following features working/tested:</p><p>- Built from Attitude Adjustment (trunk)<br />- 4 switched LAN ports<br />- Wireless<br />- WPA2+AES (Preshared key)<br />- Outgoing NAT<br />- DHCP server on LAN<br />- DHCP client on WAN<br />- DNS relay</p><p>The following features are not working/are untested:</p><p>- The Wireless LED never lights up<br />- QoS built but untested<br />- UPnP built but untested<br />- It has no web management interface (LuCi failed to build)<br />- IPv6</p><p>It might have something else that I have forgotten to mention (this is my first OpenWrt build, and I have only tested it with my router). If you are interested (these routers are not that bad, but the original 3Com/HP firmware is crap) give my build a shot:</p><p><a href="http://gapf.ninth.su/openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs">http://gapf.ninth.su/openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs</a><br /><a href="http://gapf.ninth.su/openwrt-atheros-vmlinux.lzma">http://gapf.ninth.su/openwrt-atheros-vmlinux.lzma</a></p><p>Regards and please post your comments/findings in this thread.</p>									</div>
