					<p>It looks your modem is caching port 53 dns requests for what ever reason. independet from the dns server you use. Or it redirects any port 53 request to it&#039;s own dns-server cache server to reduce traffic. Don&#039;t know.<br />So for the moment we can say it&#039;s not an nslookup vs. host vs. dig problem.<br />Updates are send correctly to the server HE and spdns because I can see them from the other end of the world.</p><p>I start test_extern script checking every 30 minutes for changes and (re)set to my own Pv6.</p><p>Have a nice sunday afternoon, I will have a hard monday.</p><p>Christian</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Bill,</p><p>good to here that your &quot;problems&quot; are not mine&nbsp; ;-) but many thanks for in deep testing. <br />So the scripts are working in general but some extensions seems to be needed.<br />1.)

Option for force the use of either IPv4 or IPv6 (&quot;-4/-6&quot; parameter in the used programs) if programs support this.<br />4.) include this into LuCI frontend<br />Something missing ?</p><p>This will take a while, but I will come back here if it is ready for testing.</p><p>For scripting start looking at <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html</a><br />There are a lot of tutorials in the Web.

					<p>Chris,</p><p>Yeah, I know about the different shells.&nbsp; When I was still working (I&#039;m retired now) they favored the Korn shell (Solaris).&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t writing them.&nbsp; A few years back, I picked up a book on Bash scripting.&nbsp; Its just that I do that sort of thing so infrequent, I never really get any practice at it.</p><p>The suggestions I made that I think you missed was the one for the date/time when the last update took place, in Luci, and requesting an AAAA record.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be looking forward to getting my hands on what you come up with.&nbsp; Because I&#039;ve got native IPv6 and can&#039;t get a public IPv4 address, its the piece I&#039;m missing for getting a web and mailserver setup.</p><p>I think I forgot to mention, that it seemed as if dig was more reliable than host.&nbsp; Again, it could just be my network, but when I ran dig it always worked.&nbsp; A couple of times host reported it couldn&#039;t find the nameserver.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I&#039;m suggesting using both.</p><p>Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>Bill,</p><p>you can force Gnu Wget, cURL, dig, host with parameter -6 to use IPv6 (AAAA) (as you did) for the whole communication over proxies, DNS-Server etc.<br />That&#039;s one of the reasons why I currently not using -6 on wget or curl if using a proxy. I tested with my routers proxy and a public one which only had IPv4 addr. The communication did not happen if you set -6 and has servers in the middle only talking IPv4. <br />That&#039;s the Idea behind &quot;force_ipversion&quot; (??) to check that all componends has IPvX addresses. <br />Router -&gt; Proxy -&gt; DDNS provider -&gt; DNS-Server -&gt; Router. <br />There is programming to do in scripts and in LuCI where the user can set the data. They need to be checked before saving to config.</p><p>Date/Time of last,update is a question on space on the LuCI status page. Space was allready the reason to put information in 2 lines.<br />You also need to think about translations into other languages. I tried allready German an some things, English is &quot;shorter&quot;.<br />The other point is that the only real timer that you can trust is uptime (OpenWrt NDP-Client is running). Uptime is also used by the original scripts. I simply reuse what was there. I will check what is possible to do.</p><p>Christian</p>									</div>

					<p>Yo Chris</p><p>Gorgeous work. Was just that close to begin some hack of my own.</p><p>I did find a bug, though. If you combine curl usage with $use_https and a bad $cacert path. What happens then is, $UPDATE_PROG gets set to &quot;ERR_NOCERT -6&quot; (or -4 that is), instead of just ERR_NOCERT. Which then gets run as command.</p><p>In dynamic_dns_functions.sh, checking curl&#039;s parameters should occur in the same order as for wget (Proxy before HTTPS).<br />Simply change the order of those two if-blocks.<br />Lines 157/168, for everyone who downloaded the file from the traq ticket.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also suggest against the use of the services and services_ipv6 files separation. <br />If a service needs a different url to update, it should just be addes as a new service, imho, no need for a new file at all.</p><p>Another problem is that some services provide their update url only for ipv4 (e.g. afraid.org). <br />It makes of course sense to use v6 when updating a v6 record.

					<p>I decide for 2 separate files because I has no chance to test all services against IPv6.<br />2nd reason is the written LuCI App which needs to know which version of ddns_scripts is installed.<br />OK there are additional bytes of flash wasted for a second file. Inside LuCI app It&#039;s easier to read from a seperate file when offering IPv6 services.<br />It&#039;s already hard as shell script to extract url for the service. (I take the code directly from current version of ddns-scripts)</p><p>Yes the code has many changes especially dynamic_dns_function.sh, but also many changes inside _updater.sh<br />It&#039;s all the result of testing with Bill (many thanks to him).

					<p>ddns-scripts just merged into trunk package repository, will take some days until availible as build package<br />luci-app-ddns update pending</p><p>known issues:<br />still a wrong answer if nslookup something like: &gt;nslookup 123.45.67.89.domain.net<br />the script returns ip address twice so there never will be a match between registered and local ip<br />same if you are using bind-host</p><p>kpv,<br />never did a multi-wan setup.<br />As Bill said, you need a separate config for every single interface.<br />please try new scripts from trunk when packaged.</p><p>Tabis,<br />a fallback was not planed. If you <strong>force</strong> IPv6 communication it must work<br />otherwise set option force_ipversion to &quot;0&quot; then everything will go the easy way</p>									</div>
