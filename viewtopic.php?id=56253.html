					<p>Hello everyone)</p><p>I&#039;m running BB r42625 (original version from openwrt.org, with built-in luci), and not so long ago I started tinkering around my home LAN trying to experiment with parameters and maybe improve something, learned about jumbo frames, my PC is somewhat fresh and new, and LAN card supports it, but I couldn&#039;t find any options involving &quot;Jumbo Frames&quot; in their name in Luci, neither could I configure mtu on br-lan or some other interface to be above 1500, except wlan0 ofc.</p><p>Being a good boy, I googled for some hours, found info about jumbo frames not being supported by TP-Link and OpenWRT firmware (in 2013), and that the switch AR8327N itself supports JF, and some guy in old topic dated year 2013 mentioned he compiled a patch for building OpenWRT images for WDR3600 with JF enabled by default, here it is - <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/39076">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/39076</a> .</p><p>I understand what it is to build something from source, I did it once with linux image, so I kinda don&#039;t want to go through this again, as it is something painful and takes a lot of time and nerve matter.</p><p>Thats why I came here and why I&#039;m asking the question - today is the year 2015, 2 years passed since the guy did this patch and announced it, is there support for JF out-of-the-box in novadays&#039; OpenWRT BB (or CC, frakk it, i can live without luci) images?</p><p>Sorry if all of this sounds noob-ish, as I&#039;m the king of network and linux noobs.I just want my DA NETWARK GOEZ FASTA, hehe.</p><p>p.s. forgot to mention, yes, I can ssh to my router and run some commands and provide feedback, if anyone is willing to help.<br />I even tried <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig br-lan\eth0\eth0.1\eth0.2 mtu (something above 1500, e.g. 1501)</code></pre></div><p>gave me errors about value being too high.</p><p>I wonder if there is just some command line switch parameter that I could turn on and JF will work...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>etadex</strong> on 13 Mar 2015, 21:52)</p>

					<p>Everything you find as changeset, is already part of current openwrt, so yes, afaik JF should be enabled, I do not think it has something to do with the mtu you set with ifconfig...</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50565">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50565</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 22 Mar 2015, 23:33)</p>
