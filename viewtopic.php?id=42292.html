					<p>Hi all. Nooobie here , and very excited about Open Wrt.</p><p>So, as above, I&#039;m using the TPLink wdr3500.

					<p>All this talk about the TL-WDR3500 being so inferior? It&#039;s seemed to be the best bargain for a duel band router on Amazon. I needed to use it as a repeater, didn&#039;t do the research before i bought it. Repeater mode wasn&#039;t included in the stock firmware... d&#039;oh! Almost returned it. Did some research, discovered OpenWRT. Installed it, along with LuCI. [OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r40768 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r10180)]</p><br /><p>I read discouraging comments about the capabilities of this router to work as a <strong> repeater / extender </strong> (didn&#039;t try out WDS).&nbsp; I almost gave up.</p><p>However, from what I read, this router is identical to the more expensive models, except for the radio module. There had to be a way!</p><p>Don&#039;t believe the hype! The TL-WDR3500 runs OpenWRT and funcions as a repeater / extender PERFECTLY. </p><br /><p>First, I followed the directions here:</p><p><a href="http://blog.michael.kuron-germany.de/2013/04/tp-link-tl-wdr3600/">http://blog.michael.kuron-germany.de/20 … l-wdr3600/</a></p><p>Then, using WinSCP, I customized my configuration file according to this post:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=176517#p176517">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 17#p176517</a></p><p>Easy-Peasy! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Hope this helps somebody.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>manthinking</strong> on 20 May 2014, 21:32)</p>

					<p>Hello fellows,</p><p>I installed OpenWRT on this router, in order to use it as Multi SSID access point, where each SSID is tied to its own VLAN.</p><p>I created the first SSID on the 2.4 GHz radio, bridged it eth1.3 interface (WAN port, VLAN3), and it worked fine.<br />I then created the second SSID on the 5 GHz radio, bridged it to the eth1.4 interface (WAN port, VLAN4) and it also worked fine.</p><p>So I created two more SSIDs, both on the 2.4 GHz radio in addition to the first SSID, and bridged them to eth1.5 and eth1.6. To my surprise this is not working, clients connecting to these SSIDs do not see their respective upstream DHCP servers.</p><p>Here is my configuration:<br />SSID1, 2.4GHz, WiFi1 bridged to eth1.3<br />SSID2, 5GHz, WiFi2 bridged to eth1.4<br />SSID3, 2.4GHz, WiFi3 bridged to eth1.5<br />SSID4, 2.4GHz, WiFi4 bridged to eth1.6</p><p>The VLANs 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected with the single cable to the WAN port of the TL-WDR3500. Corresponding upstream DHCP servers are configured identically, except each of the VLANS is in its own subnet.</p><p>Only SSD1 and SSID2 work, the SSID3 and SSID4 do not. <strong>Is only a single VLAN per wireless radio supported?</strong></p><p>Thinking that I need to turn on VLANs somewhere else, I went to the switch settings, and in addition to the untagged VLAN, added VLANs 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the CPU port. I left LAN 1 through LAN 4 port settings unchanged (untagged). As soon as I saved the settings I locked myself out. Now I can no longer connect to the router on the wired LAN ports.</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have progress. I noticed that the three bridges, connected to three different SSIDs on the same radio, for some reason had identical MAC addresses.

					<p>Ok, I plugged the TL-WDR3500 into the live infrastructure, and it is working. Awesome: multiple VLANs, trunked from the WAN port and mapped each to its own SSID; just what I needed.</p><p>Here is how to do this through LuCI interface:<br />&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Create as many Network Interfaces as you have VLANs. Interfaces attach to eth1.x, where x is the VLAN id. Make sure each interface has a unique MAC address. <br />&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then create your SSIDs one at a time, assigning each to its own Network interface created in the previous step. This will create bridges, no need to create the bridges manually.<br />&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Turn the radios on.</p><p>That is it. Do not touch the Network – Switch configuration, for this setup VLANs are already enabled where they need to be.</p>									</div>

There is no SSH in failsafe I believe. Did you follow the instructions for your first run? If not, start here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin</a></p><p>Then install Luci:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a></p><p>Note that you wifi is disabled by default and you will need to enable it. See basic config: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config</a></p><p>Once you get Luci installed, I recommend you flash Barrier Breaker 14.07-rc3 (or rc4/final when released, should be soon). These have Luci built-in and also have stable package repositories (i.e. no changes to kernel/modules). You currently have a development/trunk build, which is a bit of a moving target and will cause you more headaches in the future if you&#039;re new (like not having Luci by default). See here for 14.07-rc3: <br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07-rc3/ar71xx/generic/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_b … x/generic/</a></p><p>You can use the sysupgrade image, but I would reset to defaults since there may be some subtle differences in config files between barrier breaker and chaos calmer (trunk).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 27 Sep 2014, 18:42)</p>

					<p>Hi drwaz,</p><p>Thank you so much for your reply!!</p><p>I read somewhere that we have to use the failsafe mode to install Luci, I must have been misinformed. Though I am unable to telnet to 192.168.1.1 when connecting my laptop to the router via LAN in the normal mode. I am receiving the following error:</p><p>Connecting to 192.168.1.1....Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed</p><p>I am able to telnet in failsafe mode but not able to ssh in failsafe mode. I am able to do neither in normal mode.</p><p>In failsafe mode, I am able to set the new password and then after that when I try to ssh using this software called &quot;Putty&quot;, I receive an error saying &quot;Connection Refused&quot;</p><p>Please note:</p><p>I am using LAN Port and not WAN port on my router to connect to my laptop.</p><p>Please note I have changed my Lan IP Address to the following settings:</p><p>Ip address: 192.168.1.5<br />Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0<br />Defautl gateway: 192.168.1.1</p><p>Please let me know what am I doing wrong and what do I need to do. I just need to get the router working again.</p><p>Once again, thank you so much for your reply!!</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s unclear to me where exactly your configuration really stands. I recommend reseting to defaults using failsafe. To do so try the following commands in failsafe mode via telnet:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>firstboot</code></pre></div><p>If that doesn&#039;t work, then try:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> mtd -r erase rootfs_data</code></pre></div><p>Once you&#039;ve reset OpenWrt to defaults, then any of the guides linked to above should get you going.</p>									</div>
