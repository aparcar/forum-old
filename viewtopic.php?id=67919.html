					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I had in mind to upgrade the flash memory of my TL-WR802N from 4 to 8MiB. My plan was to de-solder the 4MiB flash chip, copy the content to the 8MiB chip and solder the thing back to have a working system.</p><p>Obviously things went slightly different: I accidentally deleted the content of the original chip without having it saved before to my computer :-/</p><p>Now I would need some help to recreate the binaries which I can flash back to the chip :)</p><p>I already had a look around and think that a good starting point is the original firmware of the manufacturer I found on there website. Inside there should be the bootloader and the original firmware and according to this openwrt forum post here: &quot;forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67548&quot; I can inject the mac address and model number of the router into the file.</p><p>If I&#039;m not wrong, the only thing I&#039;m missing should be the &quot;art&quot; information for the WiFi to work. I already searched the web but couldn&#039;t find a working link to a dump of that partition.</p><p>So to sum things up maybe you can help me to clarify those points:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Is there someone who has the same router and could provide me with a full dump of the flash chip I could burn onto my one?</p></li><li><p>Could I use the art partition of another router with the same chipset? (I&#039;m not sure on this because according to most sources here in the forum it contains calibration data which could differ depending on the device form, antennas...)</p></li><li><p>Are there other steps to do besides the injection of the MAC address, model number and the insertion of the art information to the factory firmware?</p></li></ul><p>Thanks a lot!!!</p>									</div>
