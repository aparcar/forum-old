					<p>Over WiFi, when uploading to a hard drive attached to the router itself, I get speeds of around 600-700KB/s. This is the case whether it&#039;s SSH, FTP, or AFP. I&#039;m running the December 28th LEDE build for my WRT1200ac. This is quite the improvement over OpenWRT CC, which just crashes. Over ethernet I&#039;ll hit a couple MB/s, which is what I&#039;d expect.</p><p>Two questions I have: <br />* Does this relatively slow speed surprise anyone, or is it just a consequence of the wireless drivers being under active development?<br />* Does anyone have insight on whether this might get better soon?</p><br /><p>I&#039;m saving security camera footage to a USB2 hard drive attached to the router, and it&#039;s not really a workable solution as the slow speed makes reviewing the video (over wifi) impossible.</p><br /><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I had issues (probably upgrading to a LEDE build and trying to keep settings, yes, I now know it doesn&#039;t work) with my WRT1200, and left it off for months.<br />I&#039;ve now installed your latest image, davidc502, and after redoing all the config, I have to say I&#039;m blown away by the 5GHz N wifi speed and also its stability ! Wow, last build from around september, never worked like this ...</p><p>One of my tests: streaming a game through steam from my gaming system to my laptop. At the same position as before, where no game was even playable, I can now play a FPS perfect with the latency counter from the streaming service as steady as it goes ...</p><p>Really neat build, many thanks !</p>									</div>

I was finally able to properly configure the routing of my VPN tunnel (router is a client) so that it is on its own access point, separate from my routers default WAN/LAN. Thank you @ralfbergs again for the tip, you definitely pointed me in the right direction.</p><p>1. Essentially you should start by configuring your VPN connection to ensure it can connect the way it normally would in a simple vpn client setup, I wont get into detail on this part, there are plenty of how to&#039;s on the OpenWRT wiki pages.</p><p>2. Once you&#039;ve ensured that you&#039;re router can connect as a client to your VPN server there are a few changes you will need to make to your client config, here&#039;s how my config looks</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config openvpn &#039;usny1_server&#039;
        option route_delay &#039;2&#039;
        option ifconfig_nowarn &#039;1&#039;
        option persist_key &#039;1&#039;
        option port &#039;80&#039;
        option auth_retry &#039;interact&#039;
        option auth_user_pass &#039;/etc/openvpn/userpass.txt&#039;
        option mute &#039;20&#039;
        option client &#039;1&#039;
        option comp_lzo &#039;yes&#039;
        option dev &#039;tun&#039;
        option cipher &#039;AES-256-CBC&#039;
        list remote &#039;usny1-ovpn-tcp.purevpn.net&#039;
        option proto &#039;tcp-client&#039;
        option verb &#039;1&#039;

        option tls_auth &#039;/etc/openvpn/Wdc.key 1&#039;
        option enabled &#039;1&#039;

#
# Below this point are the options I changed 
# for routing to work as described
#  
        
option route_noexec &#039;1&#039; #This tells openvpn NOT to add or delete routes 
                         automatically on your routing table, to instead 
                         look at a --route-up script

option route_nopull &#039;1&#039; #This option also prevents the server from making 
                         changes to your routing table

list route &#039;0.0.0.0/0 vpn_gateway&#039; #Default was &#039;0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0&#039;, im not 
                                    certain this option is even needed since 
                                    route_nopull, and route_noexec should 
                                    essentially make it null

option route_up &#039;/etc/openvpn/route-up.sh&#039; #This script has the ip commands 
                                            that will create the route for the VPN.

option script_security &#039;2&#039; #This option was needed because of the --route_up 
                            script, otherwise it will kick out an error message 
                            and the VPN will not connect.</code></pre></div><p>3. Next up edit /etc/iproute2/rt_tables, add a table for your vpn</p><p>Note: the value and name can be whatever you&#039;d like <br />just as long as you have added a table for your vpn</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#
# reserved values
#
128     prelocal
255     local
254     main
253     default
252     vpn
0       unspec
#
# local
#
#1      inr.ruhep</code></pre></div><p>4. Last but not least the route-up script that will alter your routing table and add a new default route for your tunnel under the routing table vpn, this script assumes that you have separate interfaces for your vpn and lan network. In my case I have an interface setup that looks like this</p><p>LAN &gt;&gt; br-lan &gt;&gt; eth1, wlan0, wlan1</p><p>VAP &gt;&gt; br-vap &gt;&gt; wlan0-1, wlan1-1</p><p>VPN0 &gt;&gt; tun0</p><p>WAN &gt;&gt; eth0</p><p>WAN6 &gt;&gt; eth0</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# This script will automatically pull the interface names and associated ip address
# based on the interface setup described above. It also assumes you are making 
# the entire subnet (ie 10.1.0.0/24) available for the access point.
# You may add individual IP&#039;s manually just edit the ip commands removing the
# variables in place of your own specific IP and interface.

sleep 20;

vpn_ifname=$(uci -P/var/state get network.vpn0.ifname);
vpn_addr=$(ifconfig $vpn_ifname | sed -nr &#039;s/.*P-t-P:([^ ]+).*/\1/p&#039;);
vap_ifname=$(uci -P/var/state get network.vap.ifname);

ip rule add from $vap_addr.0/24 table vpn;
ip route add $vap_addr.0/24 dev $vap_ifname table vpn;
ip route add default via $vpn_addr dev $vpn_ifname table vpn;
ip route flush cache;</code></pre></div><p>Also make sure you create the proper firewall zones for the VPN, mine looks like this</p><p>LAN &gt;&gt; WAN &gt;&gt; Input ACCEPT, Output ACCEPT, Forward ACCEPT</p><p>WAN &gt;&gt; Reject &gt;&gt; Input REJECT, Output ACCEPT, Forward REJECT Masq(x) MSS(x)</p><p>VAP&nbsp; &gt;&gt; VPN &gt;&gt; Input ACCEPT, Output ACCEPT, Forward ACCEPT</p><p>VPN0&nbsp; &gt;&gt; REJECT &gt;&gt; Input Reject, Output ACCEPT, Forward REJECT Masq(x) MSS(x)</p><p>You may also want to change your DNS servers as my VPN would not work unless I changed the DNS server. That&#039;s it I hope this helps someone else out, I know it took me a lot of research and digging to figure this out, had to scour multiple guides from different wikis and forums to include DDWRT forums, so you can see how it got very confusing fast.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jvquintero1021</strong> on 22 Jan 2017, 03:47)</p>
