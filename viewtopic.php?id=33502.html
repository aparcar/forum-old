					<p>Hello at all,</p><p>just a little question.<br />I would like to use openwrt for a small web-based project. <br />The idea is to use a &quot;wildcard&quot; or &quot;catch-all&quot; in the DNS - so every webpage the user requests is being resolved to the routers ip and the user gets the content of the webserver of the router. The idea behind is to make is as simple as possible for the user to access the Webpages on the router. So even a &quot;<a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>&quot; should be resolved to the local IP of the router.</p><p>So - how to do that? </p><p>I have done some research - is it possible with the</p><p>address=/.machine.domain.info/192.168.1.1</p><p>records of dnsmasq? Do I have to make an entry for every TLD like this:<br />address=/.com/192.168.1.1<br />address=/.de/192.168.1.1<br />address=/.org/192.168.1.1<br />address=/.net/192.168.1.1<br />...</p><p>Does that work ? Is there a easier / better way ?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Sebastian</p>									</div>
