					<p>What if I want to build a custom image for the latest Backfire release candidate (i.e. 10.03.1 rc4)?&nbsp; It&#039;s not tagged.&nbsp; Backfire 10.03 was tagged... and previous releases (and release candidates) have been tagged (i.e. 8.09_rc2).</p><p>I should be able to do the following to checkout a specific build, such as Backfire 10.03.1 rc4:<br />svn checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/tags/backfire_10.03.1_rc4 .</p><p>Knowing that Backfire 10.03.1 rc4 was built from SVN r24045, I could do this:<br />svn checkout -r24045 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire .</p><p>But it should be tagged IMHO.</p><p>Also, it doesn&#039;t look like the feeds packages are tagged for the respective releases.&nbsp; Again, I could do this:<br />svn checkout -r24045 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages feeds/packages</p><p>Would that ensure I was building the same feeds packages as in Backfire 10.03.1 rc4?</p><p>Is there a better way to create a custom image of a release?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>LinkZ</strong> on 20 Jan 2011, 19:25)</p>
