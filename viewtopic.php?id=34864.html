					<p>So long story short I bought a tp-link wr1043nd and I installed dd-wrt on it but all the things I am reading I am starting to think that for the applications that I want to use it for, like having it run transmission and mediatomb, I would probably be better off running openwrt.&nbsp; My question is do I need to reinstall the original tplink firmware and then install openwrt or can I install openwrt from dd-wrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>On my WR941 returning to factory firmware can be done by luci firmware flashing using standard TP-Link firmware (without boot). This probably works for other TP-Link devices, but there is not much info on wiki. See for example:<br /><a href="http://klseet.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=146&amp;Itemid=126">http://klseet.com/index.php?option=com_ â€¦ Itemid=126</a></p><p>This suggest, that flashing DD-WRT bin could work too, but I would prefer to go standard way.</p>									</div>

					<p>What I did was restore the orginal firmware then install Openwrt, however I cant get my internet connection working and the more bold I got with playing around with settings I ended up screwing something up and having to boot in failsafe mode and all that mess.&nbsp; I havent messed with it in a few days but I guess I am going to have to go back to the orginal firmware as I cant get it working.</p>									</div>
