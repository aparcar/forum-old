					<p>I am planning to deploy a (preferably cheap) OpenWRT router as a WiFi repeater for my FritzBox.</p><p>However, at the same time (and location) I need to setup a kind of doorbell notification that would pass the message to my HTPC/automation computer. The latter is in another location, running cables between the two is impractical - so WiFi seems like a good option (it is a bit far for Bluetooth, at least Class 1 which I have now).</p><p>I realize I could do this with a wall-wart computer, but these are still a bit expensive... Hence the question - would it be possible to do it with a OpenWRT router? The problem is that physically most of them do not have much of an interface (with the exception of an &quot;Add device&quot; button, possibly), so it might involve closing/signalling one of the Ethernet connection pairs... is that even possible without frying the device?</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess you want to wirelessly connect the HTPC to FritzBox. What you need is not a repeater but a&nbsp; wireless router/ap capable of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#routed.client.mode">Routed Client Mode using masquerating</a> or so call &quot;<strong>WISP</strong>&quot;.</p><p>If you know how to install OpenWrt, I think you can get a TP-LINK TL-WR741ND or TL-WR740N to do the job.</p>									</div>

HTPC and FritzBox are in the same, second location (let&#039;s call it B). The repeater is that phones, laptops etc. can be used more conveniently in the location A. And I need the doorbell for location A.</p>									</div>
