					<p>Enter your Netgear router administration, and set a static route:</p><p>Target IP: 10.0.0.0<br />Subnet: 255.255.255.0<br />Gateway: &lt;your OpenVPN server&#039;s IP&gt;<br />Metric: 2*</p><p>*) Serves me just fine. I seem to remember a metric of 1 created some problems, but I&#039;ll gladly stand corrected if somebody knows better.</p><p>In layman&#039;s terms: Your local network&#039;s gateway, i.e. your Netgear router, is unaware that the requests through OpenVPN originate from within your local network, not from outside. The static route tells him to route responses back to the OpenVPN server which will route them back through the tunnel.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 6 Jul 2013, 13:21)</p>

The firewall regulates conversation between interfaces, lan and tun+ are different interfaces and separated by default. So either you disable the firewall (I still believe a valid option for non-router machines) or you enter the following into the &quot;custom rules&quot; section (i.e. /etc/firewall.user):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -I OUTPUT -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -o tun+ -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>Note 1: It&#039;s possible that these rules can be entered via a regular LuCI mechanism, but if so, I don&#039;t know how.</p><p>Note 2: I&#039;m still fumbling my way around OpenWRT, somebody correct me please if I&#039;m making the wrong conclusions here.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 9 Jul 2013, 00:51)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>after trying today for around 4 hours i got it now.</p><p>Valid proof, that it works is too check the external IP of the phone via browser (with <a href="http://ip-check.info/?lang=en">http://ip-check.info/?lang=en</a> or something else). When i see the external ip of my router instead of the mobile-phones one, open vpn works?</p><p>I can reach my local lan.</p><p>I think the static route thing on my netgear fixed it. I tried this before with no success. dunno why this works now, <strong>but it works.</strong></p><p>Is there any possiblity to save my complete openwrt installation. I wrecked it like 20 times in the last week on trying openvpn to work and had allways to use failsafe-mode and then upload backup. But i had to create severel things new like the vsftpd.users for ftp and the custom launching skript from metai.</p><p>Thanks so far for all the help.</p>									</div>
