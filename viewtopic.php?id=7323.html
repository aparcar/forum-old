					<p>Hi this might be a n00b question but I&#039;m about to create a link between two building&#039;s networks and what I have planned is:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; multiple wireless clients<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />WAN &lt;--&gt;AP1 &lt;----WDS-----&gt; AP2 &lt;-----WDS-----&gt; AP3 &lt;------WDS------&gt; AP4 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -------------------------------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bldg 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 300m&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bldg 2</p><p>Which kind of seems like a waste - if I understand correctly every WDS link halves the bandwidth of the channel so I&#039;ll have 54/2/2/2/2 =~ 3Mbs give or take between all links?<br />The reason for two APs in each building is that AP1 with the WAN link and the PC is in the basement at the west end of bldg1, AP2 with the directional antenna is on the east end of the 2nd floor, AP3 is in the attic of bldg2, and AP4 has a ton of laptops connected wirelessly on the ground floor... </p><p>Anyway, is there some way to do links between OpenWRT units WITHOUT resorting to WDS?</p>									</div>

					<p>You want to network all of your Aps but you don&#039;t want to use WDS? Run a cat5 cable.</p><p>WDS isn&#039;t inherently problematic, it&#039;s really just a point to point link.</p><p>The problem arises when you start to do things like bridging between your wireless network and your wired network -- suddenly all the broadcast traffic from your wired network is now taking up air time on your wireless network; add to that several devices linked only via WDS and you get a sequence of &quot;recieve, transmit, recieve, transmit ..&quot; as each packet hops across several WDS links. This retransmission is what consumes bandwidth, not WDS itself.</p>									</div>

					<p>That makes sense. I guess another way to ask my question was &quot;is it possible for an OpenWRT device to be a wireless client and a wireless AP simultaneously&quot; which does, in fact, make it a n00b question. =-)</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>WDS doesn&#039;t slow down by half every step of the link.&nbsp; Once your data is on a segment not in range of other segments&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t slow it down by the same factor.&nbsp; &nbsp;From your example AP1 should be able to transmit to AP2 at the same time AP4 is transmitting AP3.&nbsp; AP2 and AP3 will be the biggest limiter of speed since the see each other and the next one in the chain.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The best way to set this kind of network up with WDS is to use a routed link instead of bridged.&nbsp; &nbsp;(See the wiki for some more info on this.)&nbsp; This will keep the broadcast traffic to a minimum and avoid loops in the WDS network.&nbsp; </p><p>The only way the device can be &quot;client&quot; and AP is with WDS.&nbsp; Setting up WDS in a routed mode can be more work but worth it in the end.&nbsp; You can make your wireless network as large and complex as you want this way.&nbsp; If you really need the speed you need multiple radios at each point.&nbsp; You could go as far as 3 at each spot, one for uplink, one for downlink and one for local clients.&nbsp; Also you need to keep these three radios on non overlapping channels (1,6,11).&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s really a matter of how much time and money you want to throw at it.&nbsp; </p><p>Hope this helps more than confuses.</p>									</div>
