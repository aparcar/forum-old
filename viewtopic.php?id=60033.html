					<p>Well people should be aware what OpenWRT devs can&#039;t do and is important.&nbsp; It can&#039;t&nbsp; be ignored forever. Why ? Well it&#039;s simple the speeds and technologies are moving over. Meanwhile OpenWRT its becoming useless ofc due to More Law . I am no developer but I know how an open source projects work out that&#039;s why I donate once a year. Well anyway have a good laugh. But this is really an important issue .</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you are making a grave mistake by accusing the devs of not giving a damn. There is a perfectly good explanation on why hardware NAT is not implemented. There is a ticket somewhere, and if I recall correctly the solution used in the stock firmware depends on a binary blob which is full of bugs. So basically, you will run into problems even on stock firmware. There is no way to &quot;clean up&quot; the code like you say, because it&#039;s not open source. Your post is ignorant at best, as a long time user of OpenWRT you should be aware of the amazing job the devs do. They might not be the best at focusing on community and documentation, but their code is top notch and they are quite hard at work IMO <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>As routers become more and more powerful hardware NAT is less of an issue. Look at my answer in your other thread, there is the Netgear R8000 that should be able to do quite high speeds with software NAT.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe it&#039;s not clear yet, why this isn&#039;t an easy task for a handful of OpenWrt developers: supporting hardware-NAT alone is not enough to speed up anything, that&#039;s because the linux networking stack wasn&#039;t invented for forwarding packets...</p><p>what the router-manufacturers do: they choose a random (most of the time: old and outdated) kernel version, then hack together a &quot;fastpath&quot; networking stack and of cause never release the sources for that... even if we had a source/patch for this, it would never be easy to port it to newer kernel versions or anything...</p><p>i mean, you&#039;re calling them &quot;lazy developers&quot;, but if i look at that 200KB kernel module on my edgerouter-lite (they&#039;re using a precompiled proprietary kernel module from the soc vendor, octeon)... i means that&#039;s HUGE, they must have spent quite a lot of man-hours to that</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nortii</strong> on 5 Oct 2015, 16:03)</p>

					<p>But I have to say the Network Stack of openwrt is going slower with each release.<br />What happen is that they like to add new daemons and processes with each release so the weak mips processors have to do more context switch between more of them.<br />In addition I disagree with the claims that hardware NAT is a ugly hack.<br />The fact is that relying on software implementation is not scalable.<br />Sure NAT might be fast on Single Client but when you throw in many Clients the number of connections goes up and the NAT performance will drop even harder than a falling rock.<br />Which is why Linaro is starting a Network Group to implement hardware NAT interfacing with Linux Network stack.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alphasparc</strong> on 5 Oct 2015, 17:28)</p>

					<p>Not that I am an expert, but part of the slow down is related to new functionality we have gained. Odhcpd makes native IPv6 connectivity (in the best case) as easy as plugging the wan cable into the openwrt router. Personally that is functionality I am willing to sacrifice a bit bandwidth to. Please also note that hardware NAT as a proposed solution falls short in the AQM department; while it would be nice to achieve higher NAT bandwidth this becomes irrelevant as long as AQM not NAT effectively limits the achievable throughput... Currently it seems that AQM requires a beefy CPU, and once you have that sufficient NAT performance comes as part of the territory. I realize that there is not a general consensus about these trade-offs though... </p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;M.</p>									</div>
