					<p>Hi folks!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a working setup with WhiteRussian 0.9 on a WRT45G v3 and i&#039;d like to upgrade to Kamikaze (mainly to get stability fixes and software upgrades).<br />Upgrade to Kamikaze 7.09 went fine, using the broadcom 2.4 image.</p><p>Now i&#039;m trying to set it up like before. I need it to be in client mode, authenticated with 802.1X to an AP, using dynamic WEP keys, in routing mode.<br />Xsupplicant used to work fine with White Russian, but now it says a lib is missing : iwlib.so.29 .</p><p>I double checked the repositories and couldn&#039;t find the iwlib package, so i tried to use the iwlib.so.28 from WhiteRussian, without luck (Xsupplicant said something like &quot;Cannot set keys :Ressource temporarily unavailable&quot;, not surprising because of wrong version number).</p><p>Is there another package containing this lib? I thought it could come from wireless-tools, but it doesn&#039;t.<br />Has anyone managed to get Xsupplicant running on Kamikaze 7.09? If yes, could you tell me a little bit about how you did it?</p><p>Another thing I&#039;ve been trying to do recently : is it possible to use xsupplicant on a bridged interface? (I mean, on an interface enslaved to a linux bridge, i&#039;m not referring to wl0_mode=wet in any way and understood why this mode can&#039;t work)<br />I think it may be possible to make the linksys act as a pseudo bridge by doing MAC masquerading with ebtables. Has anyone tried that?</p><p>Thanks in advance (and thanx for the work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah I noticed it too.<br />I used the iwlib_28 package from whiterussian download dir on download.openwrt.org<br />Wget package, and then installed it with ipkg. Then I renamed the libiw.so.28 to 29 (yes dirty)<br />but that made xsupplicant work! Or at least executing.<br />Now I&#039;m trying to connect to my school network so not sure how reliable it is, but it&#039;s not giving me any errors.</p><p>However, it should just be in the package list, and be a dependency of the xsupplicant.</p>									</div>
