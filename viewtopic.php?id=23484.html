					<p>Is there any progress of bringing Backfire to the Nanostation (Loco) M2 and M5? There&#039;s still no mention of it in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#ubiquiti">ToH</a>. Thanks!</p><p>Edit: Oh, I just found openwrt-ar71xx-ubnt-nano-m-squashfs-factory.bin in the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc3/ar71xx/">ar71xx download section</a>. Is this image intended for both M2 and M5 as well as loco and non-loco Nanostations? Is it still experimental or is it stable (aside from general Backfire 10.03.1 RC3 issues)? Any caveats?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>penkert</strong> on 14 Nov 2010, 17:05)</p>

					<p>Are your Nanostation M2 device working ok? I have heard that some Nanostation devices have quite big performance penalty when using OpenWrt instead of AirOS.

I believe there is a small performance penalty because you&#039;re losing ubiquiti&#039;s proprietary wireless protocols and going back to standards.</p>									</div>
