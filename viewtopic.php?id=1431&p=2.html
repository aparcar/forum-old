					<p>there are still known stability problems with madwifi/atheros and openwrt combos.&nbsp; while hostap works quite stable for months now on a 4km asus wl500g outdoor link, the atheros do get some segfaults every now and then.&nbsp; It can be a problem within the madwifi tree or with the openwrt or with the combination of two.&nbsp; More debuging and testing is needed and this will come with the adaptation of openwrt and atheros solution by the community.&nbsp; So be patient and do some further search/reading for this problem - never hurts - and if possible do share some of your findings with the forum!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi ,</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying for a while to get this firmware to work on a wl500g rev 2.4.</p><p>I finally got it to boot by removing the out of the box broadcom mini pci card. <br />(the std one has a chip marked bcm4306kfb&nbsp; model wl-120 R2.20)<br />Standard openwrt latest release would boot ok , but not any of acoul&#039;s versions.</p><p>I have been trying to get an atheros rev5 mini pci card to work that i scavenged <br />from a netgear wag311 pci card to no avail. (i&#039;m on a learning curve with linux)<br />But this could be the same problem as follows.</p><p>On researching the netgear it looked like the support was a bit of a ? under madwifi <br />so i bought a CM9 Wistron (altheros based) expecting the ath0 to just come up on <br />boot, but still to no avail.</p><p>Have already tried a firstboot &amp; mtd erase nvram </p><p>My question is for your sugestions from here;</p><p>I want to try manually loading the madwifi drivers for this card to see what actual <br />errors come up but am not sure of the order or required insmod commands or order.</p><p>I have a syslog server , but need instructions here to so i can set the wl500g up to <br />send the syslog capture on boot in the init.d somewhere.</p><p>Hope you can shed some clear light,</p><p>Thanks </p><p>Kazor</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve made some new modules based on todays madwifi cvs Main/Head tree.&nbsp; I belive they&#039;ve merged the BSD branch so ad-hoc and other goodies work just fine.&nbsp; You can give them a shot <a href="http://wifi.ozo.com/airo/asus/firmware/madwifi/testing/madwifi-modules/">here</a>.&nbsp; You need to load the modules by hand.&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t have a box at hand, I don&#039;t remember the order, but with some testing it shouldn&#039;t be a problem to load them.</p>									</div>

					<p>so you bought an asus wl500g accesspoint and replaced the b/g minipci card with an atheros based 802.11a card - right?<br />It would be great if you could post your test results here.</p>									</div>

					<p>hello,<br />I have test the wl500g with an atheros minipci-card (chip AR5213A) and the new release based on RC2.<br />The new release seems to be much more stable.<br />It is always possible to provoke a segmentation fault&nbsp; by senselessly switching between some options.<br />But on the whole there is no stability problem.<br />I test it as AP and STA in 2,4GHz band. No problem. About ~2MByte/s transfer volumen to a wl500gd.</p><p>The Problem is that the system runnig into an segmentation fault when you trying to switch between various optinons. for example, it runs as 11g AP&nbsp; and i try to configure it as 11a STA.<br />The solution is, to relaod the kernel-modules before reconfigure the wifi-options.<br />I have make a simple script to reload the modules.<br />Doing the reload, it was possible to play wih various configurations, with out any segmentations fault´s.</p><p>creat work!</p>									</div>

					<p>looks like nbd also ported madwifi to the latest whiterussian build.&nbsp; You may want to try <a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2279">his branch</a>&nbsp; He is a developer, I am just a little lazy hacker :-)&nbsp; If you still need hostap support, my branch works quite rock stable on a few outdoor production units here.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m being dumb here - but does this mean that WhiteRussian-RC3 will support a vanilla (stock) Toshiba WRC-1000 out-of-the-box with no modifications?

Here&#039;s some feedback: Sorry, but your sources are not usable for us in any way. Instead of integrating the features into the build system, you only changed the temporary source trees that are generated during the build process. There&#039;s no way that we can use that...<br />If you want to have your stuff integrated, please familiarize yourself with the build system and use it. I can help you with that, if you like. Then you won&#039;t have to do the same hacks over and over again whenever a new OpenWrt version is released.</p>									</div>
