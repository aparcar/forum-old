					<p>I want to keep a log of each packet that passes through a wireless access point.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for the following timestamps for each packet:</p><p>- When a packet was queued for downlink transmission<br />- When the access point started to contend on the wireless channel for the first time to transmit the packet (there can be collisions, etc. which can lead to retransmissions but I&#039;m not interested in those timestamps)<br />- When the packet was transmitted successfully on the downlink<br />- When a packet was received on the uplink</p><p>and the corresponding packet sizes for each of the above 4 cases. Also, some kind of a identifier to know whether the timestamps belong to a particular packet or another packet (e.g. there can be a time when the packet was queued, when the AP started to contend and when the packet was successfully transmitted. But it&#039;s important to know that all the timestamps belong to a specific packet or different packets.)</p><p>I&#039;m not looking for any fancy APs with the latest wireless standards. Even a simple 802.11g AP should be fine.</p><p>If anyone knows of any tools/setups/any way of getting the above information, can you please help me out. Also, if you have used these tools on a specific AP, can you please tell me the AP specifications?</p><p>I&#039;m very new to openwrt and have no experience using it. So no idea how to get started on the above setup.</p>									</div>
