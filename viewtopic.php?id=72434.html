					<p>I was configuring OpenVPN on my router using the article &quot;OpenVPN Setup Guide for Beginners&quot; as a guide (sorry, not allowed to use links yet).&nbsp; Once complete, I noticed that this guide leaves the default openvpn cipher configuration in place. These ciphers include several that are weak and exploitable as per the SWEET32 attack.&nbsp; </p><p>I also noticed that there is a much better, more thorough, and more security focused wiki article called &quot;OpenVPN Server HowTo (Streamlined)&quot; that effectively replaces the dangerously written one above.&nbsp; Rather than fix the first article, I think we should delete it and link to the second article in its place.</p><p>Can I get some support / consensus for deleting this article?</p>									</div>
