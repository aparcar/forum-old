					<p>Hi,</p><p>First of all I would like to thank everyone who is part of this community and helps developing it. Before writting this new topic I have been trying to set up my TL-WR1043ND V.3 for a PPPoE conection to my ISP.</p><p>I know that the internet service is provided through VLAN 10 and the TV service through VLAN 12. I have tried several configurations during a couple of days but none of them ever worked. </p><p>What called my attention is that as soon as I set up my wan interface protocol to PPPoE and I insert my username and password, the information shown in LuCi for my wan interface dissapears. What I mean is that it doesn&#039;t show &quot;uptime&quot; nor &quot;mac adress&quot; anymore. I don&#039;t know if this has anything to do, but seeing other tutorials and other topics it seems it should be there.</p><p>I think I&#039;m not affected by the WAN BUG because I installed the latest trunk from: </p><p><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … actory.bin</a></p><br /><br /><p>This is my etc/config/network file:</p><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config globals &#039;globals&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ula_prefix &#039;fdfa:7fd0:39cb::/48&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option force_link &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0.10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;false&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option username ‘User@’<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option password ‘passw’<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.10&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mirror_source_port &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mirror_monitor_port &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vid &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0t 2 3 4’</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vid &#039;10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports ‘5 6t&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;12&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports ‘1 6t&#039;</p><br /><p>I hope someone can help me since I don&#039;t know what else to try.

					<p>Hi makarel,</p><p>Thank you for your answer. Yes! I made sure failsafe was available <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>1) I have tried PPPoE with the default config after having made a OpenWRT factory default on my router as you said and it does not connect. As soon as I switch the wan protocol to PPPoE and insert my ISP data, the Uptime information for the wan dissapears as you can see in the following link:</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1vd0ah06a0kmp7/074403DC91F74456B882443417D8476C%282%29.jpg?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1vd0ah06a0km … 9.jpg?dl=0</a></p><p>I want to clarify that I&#039;m trying to conect my router directly to the ONT via ethernet cable. </p><br /><p>2) I tried the configuration as you said. I deleted vlan12 as requested and tried with only vlan 1 and vlan 10 and it didn&#039;t connect. This is my config file:</p> <br /><br /><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config globals &#039;globals&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ula_prefix &#039;fda7:62ab:f14e::/48&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth1 radio0.network1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;true&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;false&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option username &#039;user@&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option password &#039;passw&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipv6 &#039;auto&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;dhcpv6&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 2 3 4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vid &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;switch0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;5 6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vid &#039;10&#039;</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>* I read in&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that for this specific model:</p><p> &quot;The v2.x gets the lan and wan interface not via eth0.1/eth0.2 but via eth0 (wan) and eth1 (lan). The eth0 is in the same vlan as port 5 on the switch. Because of that, port 6 on the v2.x routers is an additional CPU port - used for wan traffic only.</p><p>Wan has VLAN 2, that shouldn&#039;t be touched, as you lose the WAN port. Start your VLANs from 3, attaching them to the eth1.x sub-interfaces.&quot; </p><p>Maybe this has something to do with the problems I&#039;m experiencing?</p><br /><p>I would be happy with internet connection only even if I lose the IPTV at the beginning.</p><p>Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ibizaman</strong> on 9 Jan 2016, 19:14)</p>
