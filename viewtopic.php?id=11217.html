					<p>curl, libcurl and fuse are all available as ipkg. After installing all of them i was hoping to find the option curlftpfs nevertheless this is not including as it seems. How would one then go about setting up the FTP mount? I know RTFM, I am doing that right now but cannot really figure it out. I am thinking curlftpfs really has to build in a ipkg to be included and made working?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>500gx</strong> on 24 Jun 2007, 15:41)</p>
