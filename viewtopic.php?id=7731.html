					<p>Apologies if this is a FAQ, but I&#039;ve not been able to find the answer in the forums. I have sucessfully loaded OpenWrt onto a WRT54GL and it works just fine. The WAN port is connected to my main router.</p><p>If I plug a PC into a LAN port on the WRT54GL, I can access the management web page. How can I access this from a PC plugged into my main router? If I browse to the IP address my main router gives the WRT54GL (via DHCP), I get &quot;cannot find server&quot;. The reason for this is that I intend to site the WRT away from my main desk and PC, and don&#039;t want to have to visit it and plug in, just to make changes.</p><p>I am very new to this so I&#039;d be grateful for step by step instructions. I just need the WRT54GL to respond to a browser coming in through the WAN port.</p><p>Thanks very much in advance.</p><p>Julian</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the answer but I can&#039;t get this to work. I am using Webif2 and have added a firewall entry as follows:</p><p>Match Destination Port 80<br />Target 192.168.3.10 (the router&#039;s IP from its own LAN)<br />Port 80</p><p>I have also tried 127.0.0.1 as the IP and have tried Source Port 80 rather than Destination.</p><p>When I browse to the router, I get &quot;Cannot find server or DNS Error&quot;.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Julian</p>									</div>

					<p>OK. This is what I had to do to set up the firewall using the webif interface.</p><p>1. Go to Netork -&gt; Firewall page</p><p>2. Add an Accept rule. Add Destination Ports to it. Set port no to 80. Save</p><p>3. Add a Forward rule. Add Destination Ports to it. Set port no to 80. Add router&#039;s IP address (on its own network, not the WAN address) and port 80. Save.</p><p>4. Apply the changes.</p><p>I guess this does the same as regloss&#039;s instructions above. Thanks.</p><p>I cannot log in using SSH to check the contents of the firewall.user file as I am getting &quot;access denied&quot;, but that&#039;s another problem!</p><p>Thanks for all your help.</p><p>Julian</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a couple more points to finish this solution.</p><p>1. The reason I was not able to log in using PuTTY was because I was entering admin as the user name, which is what I use in the web interface. Using root instead, with the same password, works.</p><p>2. The web interface puts firewall rules into /etc/config/firewall, whereas the suggestions in regloss&#039;s reply need to go into /etc/firewall.user, as he said. It is strange to me (a Linux newbie) why the format of these files should be totally different.</p><p>Thanks, everyone, for your help.</p><p>Julian</p>									</div>
