					<p>Hi all. Just wondering if it is possible to run Wine on an OpenWRT router. Using PuTTY the versions I am getting are BusyBox v1.8.2 and KAMIKAZI bleeding edge, r11404. If there is not enough room on the Flash, what about on a USB drive?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think using wine under OpenWRT is so pointless. First of all there are some apps developed both for desktops and mobile devices with windows and this can greatly save resources (such an app I&#039;m planning to use for 24 hours 5 days per week):<br />1) Reduce noice (no need in coolers, hard drives etc.);<br />2) Reduce power consumption;<br />3) Reduce costs (desktop is far more expensive than router);<br />4) Improve efficiency (it&#039;s completely unefficient to heat dual-core machine with 2GB RAM to run an app that simply interacts with server getting data from there and sometimes giving responses instructing the server what it should do);<br />I&#039;m trying to port wine to OpenWRT but there are some troubles compiling that because wine uses it&#039;s own build system to create dlls as far as I understand. I&#039;ve tried using qemu to emulate my desired arch, but also I need to point to libraries against which wine&#039;s build tools compiles. As I not so experinced in OpenWRT build system, could anyone point me the right way to build this staff if it is possible or simply give some structered list of variables and paths used by build root and how to safely provide required libraries without affecting host environment ( e.g. not to replace /lib link) and chrooting or if this is impossible, what is the simpliest way to workaround this?</p>									</div>
