					<p>I accidentally found this torrentflux mod:<br /><a href="http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/">http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/</a></p><p>It works really well with RC6, using lighttpd, PHP4 and Sqlite2. For sqlite, i have to use RC5 package - i got Assertion failed message ( it has something like sizeof( ptr ) == sizeof( char ) ) when trying to open database using sqlite package from RC6 backport.</p><p>I got Python2.5 and its dependencies from this feed:<br /><a href="http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/wl500g/cross/stable/">http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optwa … ss/stable/</a></p><p>However, i&#039;m forced to use bittornado which is a python client that bundled with tf-b4rt. It just use way too much memory - more than 64MB for 5 torrent downloads (It is like downloading into my Flash Disk before flusinh to my HDD. My Flash disk always blink its LED due to swapping <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> ) and also eats a lot of cpu cycles. My Router also become veryyyy slow while torrents are running since we don&#039;t have the &quot;nice&quot; command. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>So, torrentflux is working - just another piece of software and we should all have a perfect bittorrent download station! I want to try compiling the patched transmission client myself but i don&#039;t have a spare machine to install linux and (try) do it. I have a tight project schedule and i just cannot risk installing dual boot linux right now ( and for a while...) </p><p>Can any of you please download this source and package it for OpenWRT? That would be really nice. A busybox package with &quot;nice&quot; would also really nice <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> I have downloaded lots of busybox packages that i can find but none of them contains &quot;nice&quot; :S</p><p>Modded transmission client can be found here, would some of you please compile it?<br /><a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7000">http://developer.berlios.de/project/sho … up_id=7000</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Torrentflux is quite bulky, and in the limited testing I&#039;ve done with it, is rather buggy also.&nbsp; I would suggest you look into ctorrent.&nbsp; It is a cli application that is much smaller, (since it doesn&#039;t require python, php, and SQLite.)&nbsp; The swapping you are experiencing is a sure way to kill your flash drive, they aren&#039;t designed to be used as swap.&nbsp; Also, if you want a busybox package that contains nice, build one.&nbsp; Compiling your own OpenWRT images isn&#039;t hard to do.</p>									</div>

					<p>the only reason that i don&#039;t (and can&#039;t) use ctorrent (or enhanced-ctorrent) is that my favourite tracker don&#039;t accept it...</p><p>I have been using transmissioncli for a while - that&#039;s why i have tried to use torrentflux-b4rt as i though that it will be able to use transmission. (but it&#039;s not!) I just got tired of ssh into router to manually manage my downloads by swapping between screens and i also dont&#039; know my ratio when using transmissioncli... and transmissioncli doesn&#039;t have an option liked seed until ratio is X. It will seed forever until i manully stop it... actually transmission did have a CGI interface but i can&#039;t get that to work....:(</p><p>So, torrentflux is better than nothing, and it does a good job for me this week.</p><p>Yeah, I afraid so...about swapping. But it&#039;s just $10 - compared to $100 HDD and my data stored inside i&#039;m willing to trade off <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> but should be better if it&#039;s not under this massive swapping...I started to doubt that is there a &quot;swapping&quot; at all, it looks like apps just running straight on the swap.</p><p>okay...i i will try to compile by myself then...</p>									</div>
