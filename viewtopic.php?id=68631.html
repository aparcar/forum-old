					<p>If I want to develop a method for a client to help provision the OpenWRT router to make a connection to another AP, is there an API available from a client to ask the router to scan and to provide a passcode for the routers connection to an AP.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking to set up a router as easy as possible, but not sure if I should be using Masqueraded mode or routed mode since I won&#039;t be in control of what the main remote access point can support.</p><p>So, what is the best recommended way to connect openwrt to another AP for its &quot;WAN&quot; connection?<br />And is there an API to help create a simplified setup procedure without having a client phone device going to a web page hosted by the openwrt?</p>									</div>
