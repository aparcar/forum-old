					<p>Hello,</p><p>@written_direcon: thanks for the advise. But i do not agree completely with what you said, because with x-wrt web interfaces it&#039;s possible from what I read in documentations and forums, and i think with ssh we can have multi user access to.<br />But and with web interface LUCI?</p><p>All advises will be appreciated</p><p>Regards,<br />Craig Davids</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello to all,</p><p>First good topic and good questions...<br />I&#039;m not a developer of web interfaces but i think that with LuCI we can only log as root, and I think (not 100% sure),that is not possible to login with other user with limited access like you want. <br />But I think this is a very important feature that LuCI need to have. <br />I do not know if is possible to do this by having a different user in /etc/passwd and some other modifications... Maybe someone knows best.</p><p>In the beginning of 2011 this question was put by other user <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28316">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28316</a> with no answer.</p><p>Also can someone tell me differences between web interface x-wrt and the LuCI web interface. For people o have used both what can you tell us.</p><p>Best Regards,<br />CMarco</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CMarco</strong> on 23 Mar 2012, 16:02)</p>
