					<p>What&#039;s the &#039;correct&#039; way to force a rebuild of a package?&nbsp; I am trying to build Qt/E and Konqueror and I have to make tweaks to some of the header files.&nbsp; Make doesn&#039;t pick up on the changes (no surprise).</p><p>So how do I tell make to force a rebuild of a single package, no matter if there are .configure and .built files present?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>--Yan</p>									</div>

					<p>You can use any of the following:</p><p>make package/foo-clean (wipes out the ipkg and the directory in build_mipsel)<br />make package/foo-mostlyclean (performs a &quot;make clean&quot; in the package&#039;s build_mipsel)<br />make package/foo-prepare (downloads the source, unpacks to build_mipsel and patches)<br />make package/foo-compile (self explaintory)<br />make package/foo-install&nbsp; (produces the ipkg file in bin/packages)<br />make package/foo-rebuild (alias for &quot;mostlyclean, compile&quot;)</p><p>The above steps also produce files in the package&#039;s directory<br />.prepared<br />.configured<br />.built</p><p>You can manually remove any one of those and run make which will force it to perform that step again. And yes, I know the build system is an undocumented mess -- the buildroot-ng rewrite should solve the issues.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the commands I&#039;ve given aren&#039;t specific to the packages directory; you can pretty much replace &quot;package/foo&quot; with any directory: packages, toolchain, target -- or any subdirectory of those. It works the exact same way.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, cool. Actually, it&#039;s a pretty amazing thing...&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to port my project to it, because it provides a really rigid structure - and makes it nearly idiot proof.&nbsp; Except when idiots like me run amuck all over it.&nbsp; :-)</p><p>--Yan</p>									</div>
