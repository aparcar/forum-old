					<p>I think you&#039;ll find that the 3G dongle just appears as a serial modem. Others have configured OpenWRT devices as 3G routers already. If you&#039;re using OpenWRT you don&#039;t need a &quot;special 3G&quot; router, you can use any with a USB port.</p>									</div>

					<p>no this is not true,<br />every dongle needs to have it driver available to the router from what I know,<br />I wish it was that simple<br />We have spend months and months to get the support for as much dongle as possible with the current firmware of the MOFI router but there are many sticks that we still do not support.<br />To us, we would rather use what is made in openwrt and only focus on stick support for our 3G router.<br />We have tested DD-WRT which works with our router but the stick support again is very minimal.</p>									</div>
