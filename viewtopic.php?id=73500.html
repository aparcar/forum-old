					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to install ser2net 3.5 in my GL-iNet AR150, (ar7xx, with Chaos Calmer) but after </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update</code></pre></div><p> I only get listed <strong>ser2net 2.10</strong>. I found that this package (v3.5) exists for this arquitecture:</p><p>htt_ps://archive.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/packages/packages/ser2net_3.5-1_ar71xx.ipk (<em>please note that the &quot;_&quot; is written intentionally as I have no links allowed yet in my posts</em>)</p><p>but even if I add this to /etc/opkg.conf file, it doesn&#039;t gets listed after </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg list</code></pre></div><p>Neither is working when I do </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install htt_ps://archive.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/packages/packages/ser2net_3.5-1_ar71xx.ipk</code></pre></div><p> as I get the error</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Collected errors:

Might you help me?</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>First you should upgrade from CC to the latest release-- 17.01.4.&nbsp; Possibly the package you want is in there.</p><p>Packages in the release repositories are very rarely upgraded to new versions except sometimes when a serious security issue exists.&nbsp; Generally you would be upgrading the whole OS rather than one package.</p><p>To download a file direct to the router you have to use http download because the default wget does not support SSL.&nbsp; The OpenWrt server does support both, but URLs in the list are https assuming you will download with a full browser.</p><p>Once you have the .ipk in /tmp, opkg can force-install it and it will probably work because ser2net is a relatively simple userspace program.&nbsp; In some cases you will have to upgrade the whole OS to run newer builds.&nbsp; Certainly any kmod cannot be used on an old kernel.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 9 Mar 2018, 16:58)</p>
