					<p>I&#039;ve read through a fair portion of the thread and didn&#039;t see anything like this so hopefully I am not repeating a question. I am running the new snapshot from David with the .17 driver on Mamba hardware but my upload speed on AC is very slow. I can get download speeds around 100-200 Mbit/s but my upload speeds hang around 500 kbit/s. I can get pretty decent speeds if I set the 5 GHz radio to N but on AC it acts up like that. I have tried 20, 40 and 80 width but see the same thing. Hopefully that&#039;s all the information that is relevant.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>It was slow for me too when I first flashed... I changed from 80mhz to 40, and then rebooted the router and my devices... From there speeds on 5Ghz went back up, and I then changed back to 80mhz, and no issues from there.</p><p>I have no idea why it was initially slow.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is my experience my the latest driver. I started building DD trunk 49066 (kernel 4.4.6) with .16 driver. I did iperf3 from intel 3160 iwlwifi from linux machine. I got the average 220-230 Mbps to internal gigabit lan to one of the port for my other machine. My android phone got the average 270-280Mbps. </p><p>Once I did the above test, I built kmod kernel module package for .17 driver then apply it through opkg update. My test is very similar with .16 driver. </p><p>How did everyone do the test to get the 20-30% improvement between .16 vs .17 driver?</p>									</div>

					<p>@e88z4</p><p>Basically throughput should be almost the same for .16 and .17. But .17 fixes two problems:<br />1.

					<p>Just woke up and my build was finished. I flashed and it works like a charm, will provide some feedback on Wireless performance soon.</p><p>Edit: I don&#039;t know if it take too much time for you to rebuild the toolchain and everything but i suggest to nuke (make distclean) each time there is a major build error (like a diff mismatch or a failed &quot;new&quot; feature). Always solve the problem for me.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mrfrezee</strong> on 28 Mar 2016, 10:12)</p>
