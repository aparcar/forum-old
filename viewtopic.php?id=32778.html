					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently upgraded from 5Mbps/1Mbps ADSL to 40Mbps/10Mbps FTTC so have a lot more bandwidth available.</p><p>I&#039;m using a Buffalo WZR-G300NH as a router and wifi for my office, but I have a Linksys WRT54GS in the kitchen (middle of the house) providing wifi to the rest of the house. Both run OpenWRT.</p><p>The WRT54GS is running bcrm-2.4 as I need multi-ssid and is obviously only g, with no n wireless - so for both of those reasons, i&#039;m looking to replace it with something better.</p><p>So, i&#039;m looking for an OpenWRT capable, multi-vlan, multi-ssid wireless access point and think i&#039;ve narrowed it down to the TP-Link TL-WR1043ND, D-Link DIR-825 or Netgear WNDR3700.</p><p>Obviously primary concern is wireless performance (signal strength) and stability (the Buffalo wireless is quite unstable - sometimes won&#039;t connect at all).</p><p>Looking at the spec&#039;s, the D-Link and Netgear have faster CPU&#039;s, the D-Link 5Ghz radio and the Netgear more RAM. The TP-Link has 3x removable antennas, the D-Link has 2, but apparently 1x for 2.4Ghz and 1x for 5Ghz - the Netgear only has internal antenna&#039;s - is that a negative?</p><p>How do they perform in the real world though?</p><p>Anyone have any thoughts, experience or comparisons?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, TP-Link TL-WR1043ND is practically the same as your Buffalo, so you are bound to have the same problems. The wireless stability is a lot better in RC6 compared to RC5, though.</p><p>The 5GHz routers (including Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H) shouldn&#039;t exhibit these issues. I&#039;d pick the Buffalo since it has the largest RAM and Flash, and highest transmit power.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>some corrections: </p><p>the new revision (V3) of WNDR3700 is another architecture (broadcom) so make sure you get V1 or V2. the WNDR3800 is the successor based on atheros and is supported in trunk. <br />And the WNDR3700(V1, V2), the WNDR3800 and the DIR-825 have all two physical wifi-devices (one for 2.4GHz, one for 5GHz). <br />The DIR-825 uses both antennas for 2.4GHz and 5Ghz, this possible because it another spectrum. </p><p>400MHz of the WR1043ND should be enough for 40Mbit. But if you want to use qos, layer7-filtering, vpn-(encryption) you should get a faster cpu. If you have problems with the signal-strengh of the signal (too much walls between) don&#039;t expect 5GHz to work better. The loss through walls is higher on 5Ghz, there are some problem with the legal regulation-limits in the 5Ghz so you probably stuck at 17dBm on 5GHz if running openwrt. The one big advantage of 5Ghz is that this spectrum isn&#039;t as crowded as the 2.4GHz spectrum, but on any other aspect 2.4GHz may be superior.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 4 Nov 2011, 17:55)</p>
