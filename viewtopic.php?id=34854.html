					<p>I recently compiled the full ffmpeg library for openwrt<br />in order to record some rtsp (mp4) video streams...</p><p>While I get framerates of about 25 fps on my desktop<br />(with the same stream) my router struggles badly<br />and only handles about 2 fps ... after some time ffmpeg<br />stops to work... (CPU utilization is very high)... and<br />duplicates frames...</p><p>I use <br />ffmpeg -i rtsp://myurl.mp4 -sameq output.mp4</p><p>Does somebody use openwrt to record rtsp streams???</p><p>Any ideas to improve this experience?</p>									</div>
