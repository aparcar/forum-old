					<p>Hi,<br />&nbsp; I have 2 Linksys wrt54gl routers with kamikaze 7.09 installed. One is setup as an Access Point and is working great, but I&#039;ve bought another to create a wireless bridge and having problems creating a wds link between them. This is my current config:</p><p>Router 1 (my main AP):</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;home<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hidden&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption psk <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &quot;1234567890&quot; </p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wdsap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption none <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option bssid &quot;00:1C:x:x:x:x&quot; (mac of other router)</p><p>Router 2 (the new one)</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;home<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hidden&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption psk <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &quot;1234567890&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wdsap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption none <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option bssid &quot;00:1C:x:x:x:x&quot; (mac of other router)</p><p>I couldn&#039;t really find any docs on how to set this up, so I&#039;m not sure if my second router needs to also be setup as an Access point, accept this related line in the docs &quot;WDS links can only be used in pure AP mode and cannot use WEP (except when sharing the settings with the master interface, which is done automatically).&quot; I&#039;m not entirely sure what this means, I&#039;m assuming it means my second router also needs to be an Access Point. I&#039;ve&nbsp; tried taking out the Access Point settings on the second router config and I get an error trying to restart the networking (Command &#039;set up&#039; failed: -1) so this is the best I&#039;ve come up with. However it&#039;s not working, I&#039;m getting this error in the logs: &quot;wds0.1: attempt to add interface with same source address.&quot; so have I maybe mis configured the network settings? Any help or suggestions would be great.</p>									</div>

					<p>Right I got it eventually <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I first tried disabling encryption on all the configs and that allowed it to start working (wish I&#039;d tried this sooner <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ). I then put the authentication back for both the ap and wds config and it still works, so looks like I was nearly there, just needed to be consistent with the authentication. Here&#039;s the config I ended up with:</p><p>Router 1 &amp; 2:</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;home<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hidden&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption psk <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &quot;1234567890&quot; </p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;home<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption psk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key &quot;1234567890&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option bssid &quot;00:1C:x:x:x:x&quot; (other router mac)</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I guess I&#039;m not totally sure the encryption part is enabled, have you any suggestions on how I can prove this? After reading that tread I tried changing the key on one of the routers (just for the wds part) and after a couple of reboots the connection wasn&#039;t being made. I had a look at the&nbsp; /etc/hotplug.d/net/20-broadcom_wds script and doesn&#039;t seem quite the same as the one shown as edited and my version already has a sleep 1 command in there.</p><p>include /lib/wifi</p><p>setup_broadcom_wds() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; local iface=&quot;$1&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; local remote=&quot;$(wlc ifname &quot;$iface&quot; wdsmac)&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ -z &quot;$remote&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_cb() {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ -z &quot;$CONFIG_SECTION&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_get type &quot;$CONFIG_SECTION&quot; TYPE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ &quot;$type&quot; = &quot;wifi-iface&quot; ] || return</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_get network &quot;$CONFIG_SECTION&quot; network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ -z &quot;$network&quot; ] &amp;&amp; return</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_get addr &quot;$CONFIG_SECTION&quot; bssid<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addr=$(echo &quot;$addr&quot; | tr &#039;A-F&#039; &#039;a-f&#039;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ &quot;$addr&quot; = &quot;$remote&quot; ] &amp;&amp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; local cfg=&quot;$CONFIG_SECTION&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; include /lib/network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scan_interfaces</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; setup_interface &quot;$iface&quot; &quot;$network&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_get encryption &quot;$cfg&quot; encryption<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_get key &quot;$cfg&quot; key<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_get ssid &quot;$cfg&quot; ssid</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[ &quot;$encryption&quot; != &quot;none&quot; ] &amp;&amp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nas4not lan &quot;$iface&quot; up auto aes &quot;$encryption&quot; &quot;$key&quot; &quot;$ssid&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; config_load wireless<br />}</p><p>case &quot;$ACTION&quot; in<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add|register)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ &quot;${INTERFACE%%0.*}&quot; = wds ] &amp;&amp; setup_broadcom_wds &quot;$INTERFACE&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;;<br />esac</p>									</div>

As it defaults to trying to establish WPA2 encryption which a WRT would be unable to establish (due to binary drivers that have bugs). You have to have your WDS with WPA encryption so you have to modify the line above to be more responsive to what kind of encryption you chose.</p>									</div>
