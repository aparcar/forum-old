					<p>Hi everyone</p><p>I recently bought a WRT1900AC router as my WiFi coverage was awful with all the other routers I used before, and so far this Linksys router has been flawless. However, there are some bugs in the stock firmware and I find some features very limiting such as the media prioritsation which doesn&#039;t affect the upload bandwidth at all.</p><p>I would like to try opensource firmware to see what potential it has. I&#039;ve tried to look at how to install OpenWRT but I got lost with the Luci GUI installation part, and how to connect the modem via PPoE for the OPKG commands to work?</p><p>Could someone please give me a step by step guide on how to load the firmware onto the WRT1900AC please? Also what is the most stable firmware and what do I do if things go corrupt whilst flashing the router, (even though I&#039;ll be flashing via an RJ45 lead anyway), is there a recovery mode built into the router?</p><p>Many thanks</p><p>Will</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>willowen100</strong> on 14 Jun 2015, 01:03)</p>
