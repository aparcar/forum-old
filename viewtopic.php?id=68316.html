					<p>I&#039;m an trying to stream from USB storage on by WRT1900Ac to the TV.<br />To test this I have a correctly mounted USB stick, with a folder named music and one MP3 within it. The tune plays perfectly when I put the stick into my laptop, so the stick and the folder and contents are perfect.</p><p>I set up a network share through LuCI and from VLC on my streaming box I can navigate to this folder - called /media/usb/disk01. So this is OK too. (I checked the &#039;read only&#039; and &#039;allow guests&#039; boxes and the &#039;users&#039; field is empty</p><p>But when I click this folder, VLC tells me the directory is empty.</p><p>Interestingly, when I SSH into openwrt I can CD to media, to usb, and to disk01, but I can&#039;t seem to get any further</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# cd /media/usb/disk01
root@OpenWrt:/media/usb/disk01# ls
root@OpenWrt:/media/usb/disk01# </code></pre></div><p>while from my Linux laptop I can see this directory in Network &gt; windows network &gt; workgroup &gt; openwrt, but can get no further. Clicking on the directory get me &#039;unable to mout location - file doesn&#039;t exist&#039;</p><p>the value for &#039;security&#039; in /etc/samba/smb.conf.template is set to &#039;share&#039;</p><p>I&#039;ve tried running </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod 755 -R /media/usb/disk01/music</code></pre></div><p> but this seems to have no effect.</p><p>This is doing my head in....what am I missing folks??</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wayne1958</strong> on 31 Oct 2016, 15:28)</p>

					<p>This is probably a long shot, but you might try plugging the usb stick directly into your linux laptop and changing permissions from there (just give yourself ownership if it isn&#039;t already), i remember having a similar problem where root had ownership of my usb stick and for whatever reason the permission changes i tried through samba never took, but after i changed them directly on my linux laptop i had full access.</p>									</div>
