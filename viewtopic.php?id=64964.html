					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I want to install the Stable Branch of OpenWRT on a TP-Link WL-WR1043ND Revision 3. However, there only seems to be a Trunk (Designated Driver) for this HW revision as can be seen on the Wiki Page: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a></p><p>Hardware versions 2 and 3 of this device are identical, they only differ in the stock firmware. However the stock firmware won&#039;t let me install the image for v2, saying that I don&#039;t have the right firmware version.</p><p>From my understanding, the v2 OpenWRT image should run just fine. I only need the stock firmware to accept it. How can I accomplish this? Do I have to build an image myself?</p><p>Thank you very much + greetings from Germany<br />misdirect</p>									</div>

					<p>The wiki says to follow <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing</a>, so if Method 1 does not work then you need to move on to Method 2 or Method 3 and so on.</p><p>The wiki also says that v3 has Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 support, and it would seem that v2 flash is to be used.</p><p>Also a note in the wiki says</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>:!: NOTE: For revision v3.0, web UI on stock firmware 3.16.9 Build 151021 or newer won&#039;t accept OpenWRT image.

Since setting up a TFTP server felt like too much hassle, I found a different solution to my problem after a lot more googling. Unfortunately it is in german, but Google Translate might help anyone facing the same problem. Here&#039;s the link: <a href="http://www.freifunk-winterberg.net/tp-link-tl-wr1043nd-v3-mit-der-firmware-fuer-v2-flashen/">http://www.freifunk-winterberg.net/tp-l â€¦ 2-flashen/</a></p><p>What this basically says is, that you can flash the existing Trunk for the v3 via the stock web interface with no problems, and from there flash the stable v2 sysupgrade firmware. This has worked perfectly for me and my router is up and running now. The only tiny little downside is that it now reports as a v2 in LuCi, but that seriously doesn&#039;t bother me.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>

					<p>Your problem sounds unrelated other than you have the same device as the OP. You should start a separate thread for your problem so that this one can be marked [SOLVED] by the OP.</p>									</div>
