					<p>I just thought I&#039;d toss up my late night project tonight. I have been really trying to mess around as much as possible with the TP-Link TL-WDR3600 v1.5 models that I bought. It might seem like something very simple to the electrically inclined among us but for the mere mortals like me I thought I would share my fun and rewarding evening with you.</p><p>Why did I choose this project?<br /></p><ul><li><p>I wanted to power my routers (or more so in my use case, access points) from battery.</p></li><li><p>Assuming I could get the device to run from battery I want to see if I can recharge that battery from a solar maintainer.</p></li><li><p>Lastly but most importantly, it seemed like a really fun project.</p></li></ul><p>What I needed:<br /></p><ul><li><p>A soldering iron</p></li><li><p>#20 stranded wire in black and red</p></li><li><p>1 size N Coaxial DC Power Plug</p></li><li><p>2 F2 female leads</p></li><li><p>1 12v deep cycle battery with F2 male leads (I choose a Werker WKDC12-14F2)</p></li></ul><p>How I did it:<br /></p><ul><li><p>I put together the size N coaxial DC power plug by connecting the positive (red) wire to the small inside tab and the negative (black) wire to the tab for the outside of the plug. If you are unsure which tab is for which use a multimeter and set it to test for continuity.</p></li><li><p>I then braided the positive (red) and negative (black) wires together as best as I could leaving about 3-4 inches left at the end and stripped about 1/4&quot; inch away.</p></li><li><p>I inserted the stripped piece of each wire into a female F2 connector</p></li></ul><p>You want proof that it actually works? Ok, fine here are some links:<br /></p><ul><li><p><a href="http://imgur.com/O8lKzmz">Oh, fancy wiring and stuff!</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://imgur.com/yO1jsQT">See the router does work!</a></p></li></ul><p>Anyways, I will stop blabbing and probably start working on the next phase of how to connect the solar battery maintainer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>idlemind</strong> on 19 Oct 2014, 08:06)</p>
