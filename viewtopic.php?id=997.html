					<p>From the Forum:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hi, </p><p>Although I&#039;ve been working on this project now for a few years, I haven&#039;t yet posted here. I am one of the main developers working to reverse engineer the driver. I thought I&#039;d stop by and allay some fears. </p><p>The project is not dead, as is often asked, and we are still making progress reverse engineering it. For those of you who want a status update, the current percentages are: </p><p>wlc_phy : 12003 of 20303 instructions translated (59.12% complete). <br />wlc_led : 0 of 890 instructions translated (0.00% complete). <br />wlc_security : 0 of 234 instructions translated (0.00% complete). <br />wl_linux : 2654 of 2654 instructions translated (100.00% complete). <br />wlc_rate : 248 of 760 instructions translated (32.63% complete). <br />wlc_tkhash : 0 of 370 instructions translated (0.00% complete). <br />wlc_cmn_ioctl : 0 of 1601 instructions translated (0.00% complete). <br />wlc : 18169 of 42807 instructions translated (42.44% complete). <br />Total : 33074 of 69619 instructions translated (47.51% complete). </p><p>I generally don&#039;t frequent this forum, but if anyone would like to help, you can send an email to me or Andrew (amiklas). I will try to post new percentages every so often, when significant progress is made.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
