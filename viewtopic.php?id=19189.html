					<p>Hi.</p><p>I assume it&#039;s a Fonera or something like that? With only one ethernet port? In this case you would need to remove the lan interface. Because right now two logical interfaces share the same physical port (eth0).</p><p>~ JoW</p>									</div>

					<p>The ifname of the WAN section is empty when OpenWrt is only aware of one ethernet-port on the device. Therefore Internet Access in &quot;essentials&quot; does only work for devices with one ethernet port when you set the wireless adaptor to client mode and connect to a wireless network in range and use this as your internet connection. If you want to use the ethernet-port of your one-ethernet-port device as WAN connection with PPP* or similar you have to use the Administration mode as the risks to lock oneself out of the device was to high to allow this in &quot;essentials&quot;.<br />If your device however has more than one ethernet port then OpenWrt may have detected it incorrectly and you should open a ticket and / or try &quot;eth1&quot; instead of &quot;eth0&quot; as the ifname for wan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Yes this is a Fonera with one eth port.&nbsp; If you say I have to remove the ethernet port, do you mean from the bridge or from the configuration file?&nbsp; Certainly it must be possible to have eth0 get a dhcp address and make a pppoe connection over it, I do this all the time in ubuntu?</p><p>I have no problem with using the advanced config, or the command line for that matter, but how would I set it up?&nbsp; I want the fonera to act like an AP which gives clients access to the internet and the local network, at the same time.</p><p>Thanks again guys.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok then: go to administration -&gt; network -&gt; wireless -&gt; wifi0 / ath0, configure the wifi as you like and set the network to &quot;lan&quot;.

Go to administration -&gt; network -&gt; interfaces -&gt; wan set the network interface to eth0 and configure your PPP* connection.
