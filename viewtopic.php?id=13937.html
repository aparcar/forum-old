&nbsp;iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248<br /># This will allow Thelonious&#039; private subnet to<br /># access the VPN.&nbsp; This example will only work<br /># if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are<br /># using &quot;dev tun&quot;

There are two methods:<br /># (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for each group/daemon appropriately.<br /># (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically<br />#&nbsp;
