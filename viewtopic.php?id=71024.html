					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but I&#039;ve been using OpenWRT for a while now and just recently noticed some mention of the LEDE project, which I had never heard of before. Could someone tell me where I can learn more about what is going on? Is OpenWRT still being developed? Should I switch to LEDE? Are they maintained by some of the same people? Are there licensing differences? etc.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>IIRC LEDE is the continuation, so you should switch to it, since the openwrt trunk hasn&#039;t changed since june 2016 or so.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>user5077</strong> on 25 May 2017, 20:57)</p>

					<p>Practically all active Openwrt core developers left for a new fork called LEDE in May 2016, which action stopped the active development of Openwrt core components.</p><p>LEDE is Openwrt trunk of May 2016 plus one year of additional development. Latest stable release is 17.01.1 (and 17.01.2 should be published in maybe 1-2 weeks).<br /><a href="https://lede-project.org/">https://lede-project.org/</a><br /><a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/">https://forum.lede-project.org/</a></p><p>Note that packages and LuCI feeds are common to LEDE and Openwrt, so the difference is in the core components and packages (like procd, firewall, dnsmasq, openvpn, ...)</p><p>There is currently a proposal to combine Openwrt and LEDE again, and the plan is to overwrite the current Openwrt source code with LEDE, so LEDE is the surviving party in the possible merge (although it would likely be renamed to be the new Openwrt).<br /><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org/msg41062.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-dev â€¦ 41062.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 25 May 2017, 21:32)</p>
