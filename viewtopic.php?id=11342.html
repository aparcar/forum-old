					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I had working wifi configuration for a couple of month (Whiterussion RC6 Asus WL-500gP), but after some packet installation/upgread, it doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Wifi eth2 module is recognized by system:<br />eth2: Broadcom BCM4318 802.11 Wireless Controller 3.90.37.0</p><p>I disabled any authentication, but still no success with connecting. Dmesg and system messages after reboot doesn&#039;t say anything about problems with wifi or eth2. Ifconfig and tcpdump show no packet TX and RX.</p><p>Could someone provide me working nvram wl0_ configuration and which packets and libaries are used to run wifi? Moreover could somebody help me finding that. I already reinstalled iwlib, becouse I had some error messages in syslog and reinstall nas.</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions. </p><p>Greetings:<br />Michal</p>									</div>
