					<p>I want to know if there is any way to set up a router that is a simultaneous dual band with shared 2x2 antennas to a configuration of each radio just having its own single stream (1x1) antennas. </p><p>The reason I ask this is that I have a tp-link <strong>TL-WDR3600</strong> that I would like to use as a Point to Point link with a directional 2.4GHz antenna on the 2.4Ghz radio, and then use the 5GHz radio as a new access point for wireless clients to connect to and an omnidirectional 5GHz antenna. The router has two removable RP-SMA antennas, but based on the board layout shown at the openwrt wiki they are the dual band antennas that are then shared with both radios. <strong>Please replace the xx in hxxps in link with tt.</strong> <br />hxxps://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600#photos <br />I can&#039;t post the direct link as the forum says I&#039;m only allowed to post 0 links....LOL <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m also open to any other ideas to accomplish the same thing in some other configuration. This was just the idea that popped into my head. I&#039;m hoping someone more knowledgeable than me can chime in with any information good or bad. Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m more than willing to compile from source, flash via serial or isp etc, or update u-boot if required. If any more information is required just ask and I will be happy to oblige.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HypervisorX</strong> on 4 Sep 2016, 11:07)</p>
