					<p>Best,<br />My Router is a Enginius ecb9500. I want to use openwrt for using VPN.<br />I saw in the WIKI that I can use the firmware for the supported router Belkin F5D8235-4 V1. because the two routers have the same specs and are are more or less the same. I hope my conclusion is rght.<br />I tried the GUI to upgrade the router with openwrt-BRM 2.4-squashfs.trx<br />But upgrading is only possible with the extension .dlf<br />So I think I make a mistake. Maybe I had to use the serial upgrade option.<br />But I can not find how to use that option.<br />I have to connect the router to the PC and I can browse the router 192.188.168.1.2<br />But I fail to make a connection with ssh root@192.168.1.2<br />I&#039;am doing something wrong, I think.<br />Is there a guide whom I can use?<br />regards,<br />Lucas</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lucascaw</strong> on 10 Feb 2017, 20:26)</p>
