					<p>Hi all. new to using OpenWRT.&nbsp; I have a linksys wrt1900acs and flashed DavidC&#039;s latest build.&nbsp; I read the wiki but am a linux novice and am just not grasping what i need to do.

					<p>While you can partition and format the drive on the unit with the HDD attached, you will find it much easier to do it from a desktop/laptop running Linux (if you have one). I have been using ext3 as a partition type because I needed to use the HDD with an old Ubuntu release that didn&#039;t support ext4, otherwise I would use <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Ext4">ext4</a> (there are other types you could use and may be preferred, but I would avoid using FAT or NTFS if you possibly can - Windows support is about the only modern case that you may want these, FAT doesn&#039;t support links and NTFS doesn&#039;t support full permissioning).</p><p>To see that the kernel is detecting the device, you can install <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.essentials">usbutils</a> then you can issue <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/lsusb8.html">lsusb</a> from the shell. You should be able to see it listed as a device. It is most likely that the device will have an entry <em>/dev/sda</em> and if you create a single partition then that will be listed as <em>/dev/sda1</em>. Then I installed <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/block_mount">block-mount</a> and everything is accessible from <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">luci</a>. You will also need <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage">kmod-fs.ext4</a> among others.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Required Packages for USB Storage</p><p>When your USB device is properly recognised by the system, using the proper driver kernel packages listed in Basic USB support, the following packages facilitate USB storage support:</p><p>kmod-usb-storage required … Kernel support for USB Mass Storage devices.<br />kmod-fs-&lt;file_system&gt; required … the file system you formatted your partition in. Common examples include kmod-fs-ext4, kmod-fs-hfs, kmod-fs-hfsplus, kmod-fs-msdos, kmod-fs-ntfs, kmod-fs-reiserfs and kmod-fs-xfs.<br />kmod-usb-storage-extras optional … Kernel support for some more drivers, such as for SmartMedia card readers.<br />block-mount recommended &amp; required (if using fstab UCI configuration or luci Mount Points) … Scripts used to mount and check block devices (filesystems and swap) and hotplug capability (recognition when device is plugged in).<br />kmod-scsi-core Any mass storage is a generic SCSI device.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the Attitude Adjustment release, other optional packages included: block-hotplug for USB recognition upon plug-in and block-extroot required for rootfs on external storage. In r26314 the three opkg packages block-mount, block-extroot and block-hotplug have been merged into a single package block-mount.<br />Additional Packages for USB Storage</p><p>e2fsprogs additional This package contains essential ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem utilities for formatting and checking for errors on ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems like mkfs.ext3, mkfs.ext4, fsck and other core utilities.</p></blockquote></div><p>That&#039;s pretty much it. If you have Windows then I guess you will need to <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/storage">do it on the unit from a terminal</a>. You should also take a look at <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/fdisk_partitioning.html">fdisk</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xotic750</strong> on 28 Apr 2016, 21:47)</p>

					<p>I had installed several packages prior to this and decided to remove them so I would have room for the ones you mentioned.&nbsp; Somehow I hosed the web interface from working.&nbsp; The simple fix was to reflash. I created an Ubuntu 16.04 machine on my MAC with vmware and created a ext4 and NTFS partition.&nbsp; Mount Points in the GUI saw the device and it is now mounted as /dev/sda1.&nbsp; I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; ;-p</p><p>Thanks again for your help!&nbsp; Hopefully I will have some time later to get it working with minidlna and stream some media.&nbsp; For some odd reason Ubuntu would let me write files to the NTFS partition but told me I didn&#039;t have permission to write to the ext4 partition.</p>									</div>
