					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I&#039;ve got an ancient Draytek Vigor 2500 here - well... ancient... its current firmware was built in 2004... - and I&#039;d like to get OpenWRT installed on it, or at least, I&#039;d like to be able to SSH into it and get a decent shell.</p><p>I&#039;ve got some information on it:<br />- what nmap thinks:<br />MAC Address: 00:50:7F:19:38:46 (DrayTek)<br />Device type: broadband router|general purpose<br />Running (JUST GUESSING) : D-Link embedded (88%), Draytek embedded (88%), Linux 1.X (85%)<br />Aggressive OS guesses: D-Link DI-804 Cable/DSL Residential Gateway (88%), Draytek Vigor 2200e DSL router v2.1a (88%), Linux 1.3.20 (x86) (85%)<br />No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).</p><p>Earlier, in a dump, I saw the following as a part of the TCP fingerprint dump from nmap:<br />SInfo(V=4.11%P=<strong>i686-pc-linux-gnu</strong>%D=1/18%Tm=479112BF%O=1723%C=-1%M=00507F)<br />That&#039;s a pretty clear indication of this thing running Linux, isn&#039;t it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>- I can log in to the web interface, without the source I can only guess my way in;<br />- I can log in to the telnet interface, it barely works and is very annoying, some kind of proprietary shell (don&#039;t they need to release source code because of GPL?);<br />- I can log in to the FTP interface, there&#039;s a .cfg and an .all file, `file` doesn&#039;t know what to do with both of them but `strings` prints some interesting information on the &#039;.all&#039; file:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ShowtimeInit() on Entry.c &#039;<br />DMT PwrDown Switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SERIOUS ERROR, OS NOT STOPM&quot;<br />`strings` gives nonsense output for the &#039;.cfg&#039;, mostly a lot of y&#039;s and ]&#039;s.</p><p>I&#039;ve opened the box up and took some pictures of it. They are available at <a href="http://images.dazjorz.com/draytek">http://images.dazjorz.com/draytek</a>. They aren&#039;t all very clear, but if you need anything else - &quot;what&#039;s written on...&quot; - just let me know.</p><p>Hopefully we&#039;ll be able to hack this thing. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dazjorz</strong> on 19 Jan 2008, 00:32)</p>
