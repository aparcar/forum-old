					<p>I have a DIR-300 with OpenWrt backfire currently installed. Recently I want to access Redboot to reflash it, but I cannot access.</p><p>I configured my PC&#039;s IP to 192.168.1.2, then use the script to telnet to the Router. 10-15s after powered on, I can ping to 192.168.1.1, but putty always say &quot;Connection refused&quot;.</p><p>I tried several times, but no luck. </p><p>Is there anyway to reboot directly to RedBoot? or configure/get the current boot wait timer in my device. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything wrong. I tried to reflash RedBoot but still can&#039;t access it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Funnnny</strong> on 18 Apr 2014, 07:18)</p>
