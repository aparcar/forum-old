					<p>I&#039;ve managed to brick 2 Motorola WE800g v2 boxes and luckily unbrick 1 of them. The NVRAM gets messed up by following the FAQ and recommended settings that are wrong. Fortunately on one the wireless interface stayed alive and I used telnet to eventually fix the NVRAM variables.</p><p> On the second box. I can TFTP different versions of OPENwrt to it all day long, but can never get telnet, ssh, or a browser to talk to the box. Failsafe mode is NOT an option because the reset button does NOTHING on a v2 machine regardless of various claims that&#039;s it&#039;s been fixed. Can&#039;t someone post a version of openwrt for moto WE800G v2 for which the failsafe mode will actually work, or some other way to get telnet or anything but ping or tftp to talk to it?</p><p> Thanks, Dave</p>									</div>
