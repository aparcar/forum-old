					<p>Looks like the ethernet driver module is being removed... </p><p>Try &quot;logread -f&quot;, and then start frottle to double check if those messages are in actual fact being generated due to frottle, or perhaps something else.</p><p>et.o being removed like that is very odd, and it&#039;s the only reason I know of to see the &quot;Freeing alive device&quot; message.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes. This messages is due to frottle running. I didn&#039;t know frottle eat too much resources. :-(<br />I&#039;m going to test if the fact of I&#039;m bridging vlan1 with wds node make some diference.</p>									</div>
