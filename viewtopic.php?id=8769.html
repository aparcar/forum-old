					<p>Flash size isn&#039;t important, as soon as you can do pivot_root to USB-MSD. The limiting factor will be RAM. <br />USB-MSD with 8MB is possible, but I&#039;m not sure about airdump.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, well I guess I will venture into compiling things in Linux!&nbsp; Is there any kind of newbie guide for this topic, or is it just try and learn?<br />Will Ubuntu be fine to compile this?&nbsp; That is what I have installed on my extra computer, but If a different linux distribution is required, would it work under a virtual PC in windows?</p>									</div>

					<p>With Debian even 256MB would be enough. To little memory will increase your built time. </p><p>I&#039;ve only used the stable branch so far (I feel that what I do is unstable enough to give me a headache ^^)</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, i have it downloaded, and went into the configuration and removed some stuff, now I am building it, I hope it is small enough!&nbsp; I probably didn&#039;t remove everything I needed to, or even add everything I needed to, but this is just for fun, and that router will not be able to be used until sometime next week (I will get a new one with 4MB Flash and 16MB RAM which will become my router).</p><p>What exactly will I need to do what I listed above (USB Mass Storage (fat support maybe?), telnet, airodump)</p>									</div>

					<p>Check out <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/USR5461">http://wiki.openwrt.org/USR5461</a>. There are forum threads here on devices with 2MB flash, too ( I don&#039;t have one, so I can&#039;t help you here).&nbsp; More RAM is always better, but more flash won&#039;t be necessary, as soon as you have MSD support working.&nbsp; </p><p>For USB: follow <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbStorageHowto</a> . FAT is OK, ext2 is a lot better.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, you have been a lot of help.&nbsp; On the 5461 page, the guy talks about nbd&#039;s micro (found it here <a href="http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/">http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/openw … terussian/</a> )<br />and he talks about applying a patch, but the link does not work, but I found it here ( <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/target/linux/brcm-2.4/patches/010-bcm47xx-cam_absent.patch">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/t … sent.patch</a> )</p><p>How do I get this micros sources and apply this patch?&nbsp; Also, this patch is from kamikaze, not WhiteRussian.</p>									</div>
