					<p>Hi Everyone<br />I finally managed to come to the conclusion that it&#039;s time to sunset my almost 10 year old Fritz!Box 7050! I&#039;m looking at the Archer C2 (<a href="http://www.microspot.ch/msp/product/Bridges-Routers/0000850435/TP-LINK-Archer-C2-AC750-Wireless-Router-4-Port/detail.jsf">http://www.microspot.ch/msp/product/Bri â€¦ detail.jsf</a>) but I just don&#039;t see any reference that it&#039;s compatible with OpenWrt or even DD-Wrt.</p><p>Please bear in mind that this is the first time I&#039;m going to use OpenWrt, so I might just be searching for the wrong keywords.</p><p>Any inputs are welcome.</p><p>Raphael</p>									</div>

					<p>No because<br />a) There is very little support for 802.11ac devices on openwrt at the moment - those that are supported are all experimental<br />b) That router was only announced four days ago. Even on the most popular routers it typically takes weeks to months before even <em>basic</em> support is possible on Openwrt.</p>									</div>
