					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m looking for recommendations&nbsp; or pointers to achieve the following<br />- captive portal with internal authentication<br />- simple web page for our receptionist to create accounts &amp; generate passwords when demanded by visitors<br />- self expiring accounts, like one / three / seven days, the receptionist can decide according to visitors need<br />- ability to create even longer accounts when demanded by visitors, eg 30 days.</p><p>Our current, propietary system, does all this, but it is aged and I&#039;m afraid it&#039;ll break any time soon. :-(<br />I do not see visitors self-registering as an option, nor external authentication systems. The amount of visitors weekly is low, say 1 to 5, so building complex system is an overkill.</p><p>I hope that somebody does have an idea and shares it.</p><p>Let me just say that I&#039;ve already checked coova and wifidog.</p><p>Edit: Maybe I&#039;m asking way too simple questoin, but I&#039;m totally new with open-wrt and I&#039;m grateful of any pointers to the right direction.</p><br /><p>Harri</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hwa</strong> on 18 May 2009, 13:10)</p>
