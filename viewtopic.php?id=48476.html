					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I hate this being my first post, but I&#039;ve gone and mucked it up already.</p><p>I was trying to make it a wifi repeater. I installed the openwrt perfectly, had it working. </p><p>Then I went to change the ports. I misread the instructions, and changed them to the same as the router (it said same family, I thought it might have needed the same port to repeat or something).</p><p>I managed to get it working by turning off the router, and I thought, okay, change it to something else, so I changed it to something else (192.168.0.2), and since then it won&#039;t talk with the computer.</p><p>Now since it changed, it won&#039;t connect to the computer.</p><p>I&#039;ve turned the modem and everything off so it won&#039;t conflict, but still not connecting. </p><p>I&#039;ve pinged 192.168.0.2. and it replies back with &quot;192.168.0.100: Destination host unreachable&quot;</p><p>I&#039;ve tried getting it into failsafe mode, restarting the device and pressing the reset button, holding it down, waiting a few seconds, trying it every different way. But failsafe mode doesn&#039;t seem to be turning on. The light sequence doesn&#039;t change at all. </p><p>I&#039;ve been at it for hours now, and it&#039;s really frustrating. I&#039;m hoping I&#039;m stuffing up something simple.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Two ideas:<br />1) Set your PC&#039;s IP address manually to fixed 192.168.0.4, so that it is from the same subnet as the problematic router. Connect PC directly to a LAN port of the router. Then try telnet/SSH connection.</p><p>2) Try failsafe again.&nbsp; Failsafe requires you to push the button during the correct 2 second period during the boot sequence. So, check your router&#039;s wiki page and search the forum for possible hints about the exact moment to push the button.&nbsp; (And set PC to have a fixed IP address from the same subnet as the failsafe mode (192.168.1.x).)<br />Is it surely 702N? not 703? There is some advice for 703: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n#failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … lsafe.mode</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 17 Jan 2014, 09:23)</p>

					<p>Well one problem fixed, another one pops up&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>It is the 703N, sorry, I miss spelt when I was doing it.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to make what I thought was a simple repeater. I&#039;ve got an ethernet Arduino build that I want to plug into it, so I don&#039;t need to run cables through the house.</p><p>When the wr703n arrived, it had chinese firmware. I tried to flash the correct english firmware, but I got errors I couldn&#039;t understand, so some more googling and I found out the 703n was identical to the TL-MR3020. So I flashed the 3020 english firmware, and it worked. Then I flashed the openwrt TL-MR3020 firmware, and that worked too, the 703 firmware came up with compatibility errors. </p><p>Okay, current errors.</p><p>I tried several tutorials on getting it working for the 703n, I always got stuck when trying to change the directories:</p><p>cd /etc/config/wireless</p><p>It&#039;d open config fine, but couldn&#039;t find wireless. So I&#039;m guessing that folder isn&#039;t there. So all the tutorials would stop there.</p><p>Next I tried this tutorial for the MR3020:<br /><a href="http://ediy.com.my/index.php/blog/item/81-connect-two-wireless-router-wirelessly-bridge-using-tl-mr3020">http://ediy.com.my/index.php/blog/item/ … -tl-mr3020</a></p><p>I could get everything correct following the guide, but no internet comes through. It shows up on my computer as limited. It&#039;s not that complicated of a tutorial, and I double checked it several times.</p><p>I thought if I could go back to the 703n firmware, it might fix whatever I&#039;ve done wrong, but it comes back with: &quot;The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.&quot;</p><p>The firmware I have on the router is:</p><p>System<br />Router Name&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt<br />Router Model&nbsp; &nbsp; TP-Link TL-MR3020 v1<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.3.8<br />Local Time&nbsp; &nbsp; Thu Sep 8 16:09:17 2011<br />Uptime&nbsp; &nbsp; 0h 4m 26s<br />Load Average&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Any advice? </p><p>I&#039;m stuck now&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>columnmn</strong> on 18 Jan 2014, 00:54)</p>
