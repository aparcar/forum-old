This is most likely where your problems are coming from and why ifconfig is showing eth0.1 has an IP of 192.168.1.1 (even though ifconfig shouldn&#039;t show any IP for eth0.1 because it is part of a bridge, br-lan).&nbsp; You are basically confusing the router because of the incorrect switch settings and for some reason it is generating that 192.168.1.1 IP on eth0.1 even though eth0.1 is part of br-lan with a static IP of 192.168.2.1.</p><p><strong>A MUCH, MUCH simpler solution would be to delete the ModemTI interface completely, and set the LAN interface back to 192.168.1.1 (basically restore everything in LuCI --&gt; Network --&gt; Interfaces and LuCI --&gt; Network --&gt; Switch (if you changed any Switch settings) to the defaults or install @david&#039;s latest build and choose not to keep settings).&nbsp; Then go to LuCI --&gt; Services --&gt; uHTTPd, and simply change the HTTP IP from 192.168.1.1:80 to 192.168.1.2:80 (or any IP with 192.168.1.X, where X is not 1) and HTTPS IP from 192.168.1.1:443 to 192.168.1.2:443.&nbsp; Then you can access your modem from 192.168.1.1, and your router/LuCi from 192.168.1.2.&nbsp; (To access the router via SSH, you would still use 192.168.1.1) </strong>&nbsp; Just incase you are curious, uHTTPd is the webserver on LEDE that allows you to access the router/LuCi from your browser.</p><p><span class="bbu">Or, since you can change the modem&#039;s IP, if you wish to keep the router&#039;s LuCI IP and SSH IP to both be the same to avoid confusion, instead of changing uHTTPd settings on the router, as I just described above in BOLD, change the modem&#039;s IP to be 192.168.1.2.&nbsp; Then you can access the modem at 192.168.1.2, and access the router via LuCI and SSH at 192.168.1.1</span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 18 Jun 2017, 03:39)</p>
