					<p>I believe this is the best way.</p><p>The DVR is connected to the main router by ethernet. A desktop is connected to another router, which is connected to the main router via wifi client mode.</p><p>Basically: DVR -&gt; Main Router &lt;- Other Router &lt;- Desktop</p><p>I cannot make a direct connection to the DVR through the other router, but I can using a USB adapter. But the USB adapter doesn&#039;t work well due to poor signal strength, so the DVR software is sensitive to dropped packets, and so I prefer using the other router for that and other reasons.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to figure out how set up a static route, on which router do I create the static route, and using luci, what does the interface, target, IPv4 netmask, IPv4 Gateway, and metric options mean?</p>									</div>
