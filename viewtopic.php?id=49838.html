To test the default rules, try to upload something at full speed and see how the downstream speed and latency are affected with and without qos.</p>									</div>

					<p>I need to avoid the situation, where one user with 10 download threads eats all the bandwidth and next thread of other user will have 1/11th of bandwidth. Qos in in stock firmware works as expected, but I want to use openwrt.</p><p>I want each user (IP) to have the same piece of cake, no matter how many threads they have open, kid with running torrent or download manager is killing others, I want him to be able to download while the others can fairly work too.</p><p>I think this worked on openwrt previously, I just needed to configure the line speed, but now it throws errors like the above and does not QOS at all.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 2 Apr 2014, 12:45)</p>
