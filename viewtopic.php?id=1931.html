					<p>I used to compile on Windows. Kinda... Sorta... I was using <a href="http://www.colinux.org/">coLinux</a> running Debian + X + Windows VNC client (when I wanted KDE). With coLinux Debian starts just like regular Windows application.</p><p>You can download it <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98788">here</a>. Their <a href="http://wiki.colinux.org/">Wiki</a> contains a lot of information on tuning and configuring.</p><p>I highly recommend it --- I had no problems whatsoever running it under Windows and it was very fast (almost native speed).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uhop</strong> on 5 Jul 2005, 08:38)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the replies</p><p>Cygwin could work if I had the patience to set up ncurses, and what ever other dependencies that a stripped down linux box has. Also the tool chain is dedicated Cygwin, not standard linux. The binaries from standard linux dont work.</p><p>Finally Cygwin has been pretty much replaced by a friendlier version called msys which lets you make true windows programs out of linux code. It is a bit bizare, but it works.</p><p>I will look at the debian solution. I have had good success with debian in the past.</p><p>thanks,</p><p>Michael</p>									</div>
