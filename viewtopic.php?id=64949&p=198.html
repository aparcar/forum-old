However, in the last experimental build I downloaded and included a patch that fixed this issue. What I don&#039;t know is if it was the -RM2 that had the problem or not. I believe it is but am not 100 percent sure. </p><p>If you want to try flashing, then try flashing to the latest experimental build. If it doesn&#039;t flash then you can always fail back over to the Factory Firmware using the recovery procedure which is super easy. From there it would be a waiting game until the developers fixed the issue.</p>									</div>

I skipped on that model because of how linksys had such a lousy release.&nbsp; Plus seeing that the 1900 series has so many offerings on 3rd party wrt firmwares, i chose to go for a 1900 series at $80 shipped. I don&#039;t see a reason for AC for me, just wanted a good base for ethernet connex and WRT for my security needs. Since just this last month, my neighbors have completely abused auto scanning for open ports, with their new devices&nbsp; both on AC and N channels. Now that AC is a norm for all new products, i must use out of country bands to be able to compensate congestion.&nbsp; Being smack daub in the middle of my block and sharing back yard space, i am surrounded by at least 2 routers per home, smart printers, video cast, game consoles, wireless speakers and other devices, because peeps are too lazy to check and configure channels for best use and wire up devices that are static in their locations. If it were not for the 50 + APs and smart hub devices running on auto channel mode, i would find keeping my network stable on one particular channel. And may think about AC. </p><p> Now that the 3200 series has finally been cracked on its issues, it makes sense now to pick one up, instead if passing it by. It&#039;s pretty bad that linksys has dropped the ball down the toilet, as they seem not to be concerned about their issues with the 3200 series.</p><p>David, Linksys should pay you a percentage of their sales, now that there is good reason (your build) to by the 3200 series router now.</p>									</div>
