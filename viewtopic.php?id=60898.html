					<p>Hi...</p><p>I always have read about OpenWRT so I finally gave it a try - yesterday.<br />I flashed Chaos Calmer 15.05 on my tp-link WDR 4300 V1.3. Everything worked as expected.</p><p>But it appears to be very slow.<br />I have connected my gigablue HD Quad Plus Sat Receiver with HD to one of the ethernet ports of the wdr 4300. On the other end I have connected my notebook via WLan.</p><p>With the stock image I used to get ~200Mbit over the wire/air.<br />With OpenWRT I just get ~50MBit. Thats not so nice!</p><p>What am I doing wrong? Any hints?<br />What are others getting?</p><p>Thank you for your help,</p><p>Roland</p>									</div>

					<p>I went back to stock firmware about an hour ago.<br />I am back at the speed I had been used to.</p><p>This is sad. I love the flexibility of openwrt - but the lack of performance I have seen was too much.<br />I hope that this can be resolved at some time so I will switch back to openwrt at that time again.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt does not support hardware-accelerated NAT, which limits its WAN to LAN throughput.&nbsp; OEM firmware on most modern routers enables hardware accelerated NAT, many supporting near gigabit speeds.&nbsp; I have not heard any plans to bring hardware NAT to OpenWrt.&nbsp; Last time I inquired I believe the reason given was related to no open source drivers for the hardware acceleration components.</p><p>I recently purchased an Edgerouter Lite for my firewall/NAT for gigabit internet, and relegated my OpenWrt router to a simple WiFi access point without firewall/NAT.&nbsp; I could choose to run DHCP server, DNS caching, etc, on the OpenWrt router for the LAN, but I just left them enabled on the Edgerouter and turned everything off in my OpenWrt router except for WiFi AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. Some hardware accelerated features might be the reason for my problem. But I believe not all.</p><p>While I had connected WAN and LAN inferfaces in bridge when using openwrt (which was a nice feature - one NIC more to use) I made my latest tests with wired connections using 2 of the 4 LAN interfaces of my WDR 4300 - excluding the WAN interface.</p><p>Notebook with GBit on one side. A GBit gigablue quad plus sat receiver having a 2,5&quot; hard drive on the other side. I copied a 1 GByte file over the wire. With the stock Firmware I get 200 - 240 Mbit (the Sat receivers CPU is not the strongest one). With openwrt I was just reaching ~50Mbit/s in the same scenario. SOMETIMES for a short period openwrt accelerated to about the same speed but not constantly.</p><p>For testing I also plugged in an usb stick in my router and exported it via samba. Here I got ~40Mbit/s with openwrt while when doing this with stock firmware and the very same usb stick I get ~80MBit/s.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Rosch</strong> on 16 Nov 2015, 09:02)</p>

Its lan port can transfer easily ~800MBit on windows.<br />The Lan port on the sat receiver saturates at about ~240 MBit. The cables in between are both 3m CAT6e. Cables are directly connected to 2 of the 4 LAN ports on the wdr4300. There is not much room left for bad equipment.&nbsp; I am satisfied when I would get constant ~200MBit in this configuration. But 50 is too low. </p><p>I have no speed problems in the identical HW configuration when I use the stock firmware :-(</p>									</div>
