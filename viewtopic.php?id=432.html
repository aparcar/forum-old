					<p>I&#039;m trying to create following network scheme:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[wire clients]--wrt54g[1]-
                           
[wire clients]--wrt54g[2]---&gt;wireless--&gt;wrt54g[0]--LAN
                           /
[wire clients]--wrt54g[3]-/</code></pre></div><p>wrt54g[0] should route and 1-3 should bridge their lan-wifi interfaces.<br />(thus there would be one hop going from wire client to LAN)</p><p>So far I&#039;ve encountered number of problems:</p><p>1. I couldn&#039;t get wrt54g working when mode is STA and eth1 belongs to bridge: ifconfig shows no packets are received.<br />If mode is changed to WET it seems to start working, but very unreliably (many packet losses). I can bridge when in AP mode (this is default) fine.</p><p>2. I couldn&#039;t get WPA working on wrt54g acting as client. I&#039;ve tried both,<br />-A and -S modes.</p><p>I&#039;ve found in <a href="http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/LinksysWrt54g">http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/LinksysWrt54g</a><br />about wl_sta.o module, which should be used if wrt54g is in client mode: but couldn&#039;t find that file in any linksys source package.</p><p>Then I&#039;ve tried using WDS, better luck here, wds works ok in bridge and I can bridge eth1 &quot;alone&quot;, thus getting router instead of bridge.<br />Performance is almost twice as bad (using only 2 devices), STA-to-AP would get me ~2.7MB/s, wds only ~1.5MB/s.</p><p>Next problem is reconnection: after simulating one device power failure, link usually doesn&#039;t get reestablished until second device is rebooted: I&#039;ve solved it using custom script to &quot;wl reboot&quot; if partner can&#039;t be reached, but it&#039;s not long term solution.</p><p>Please post any ideas and comments.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks.<br />That went ok, small subnets (255.255.255.240) on end wrts even make sense.</p><p>However I&#039;m still &quot;having&quot; problems with reconnection after power failure:<br />If AP is powered down and plugged in again after several seconds, client reconnects ok.<br />If client is powered down/up, it never connects to AP: wl down/wl up, wl joint &lt;ssid&gt; etc. doesn&#039;t help.<br />wl scan finds AP, iwconfig shows correct AP mac and ssid but no data is transfered.<br />If AP is rebooted client reconnects right away.</p><p>I could (and am) using simple script to reboot (or more exactly, wl down/up) AP when it can&#039;t reach client, but that won&#039;t be pretty with several clients.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update:</p><p>Reconnection problems seems to be related to WEP.

					<p>Dunno, i use the one WRT in client mode for internet browsing with one wired PC attached to it.<br />I hadn&#039;t any problems so far.</p><p>I just have set wl0_mode to sta and it works.<br />Even with WEP 128 on both sites <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>But to be true, I don&#039;t access the WRT client from the intranet site, so I can&#039;t really tell you if it looses the connection from time to time.</p><p>I know Sveasoft has written for Alchemy some monitoring application which probhits that behavior.<br />Maybe you can port it ?</p>									</div>
