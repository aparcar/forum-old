					<p><strong>tmo26</strong> - thx for uh...help. As I said, I don&#039;t have the files that are mentioned in the update process [.ubi], and something more. I&#039;m stuck with .bin and .tar.

What I did was to soft reset with 30 second pressing the reset button. That booted the router into Linksys WebUI as I expected it to.

Now, the next problem is Luci. </p><p>I know the Snapshot images don&#039;t include Luci, So when I tried to follow the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">minimal install</a>, it errored out for a unmet dependency &quot;luci-lib-jsonc&quot;</p><p>EDIT - Never Mind. Took some figuring out. Posting here for those who might come after me. Turns out, you DO need one additional package to be installed before Luci will work. <br />luci-lib-jsonc_git-16.108.33174-51a7f96-1_kirkwood.ipk. Here Kirkwood is my architecture. It might be different for others. Anyway for me this file is located at generic/packages/luci/ . This dependency is not identified in the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">Wiki Page</a>. I have updated the wiki page.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>perseus</strong> on 25 Apr 2016, 22:35)</p>
