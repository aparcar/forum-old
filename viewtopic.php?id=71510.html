					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;m trying to configure a Virtual setup for testings with Virtualbox (V. 5.1.22 on Windows).<br />I created an Operwrt (Generic combined x86) machine with two network interfaces, the first as Host-only (to be the LAN) and the second as Bridged (to be the WAN).<br />Also created an Ubuntu machine with an Network interface as Host-only.<br />So far I know, both Host-only interfaces will be on the same network (It does not matter that they do not have access to the host for my tests).<br />With both machines up running, I configured both with fixed IPs (Openwrt with 192.168.1.1 and Ubuntu with 192.168.1.2).<br />Running &quot;nmap 192.168.1.1 -p 1-80&quot; on Ubuntu, nmap shown only ports 22 and 53 open.<br />Since 192.168.1.1 are the LAN on OpenWRT, Port 80 should be responding the same way as a real router conected to my notebook with the IP fixed as 192.168.1.2.<br />What is wrong?<br />I googled for anyone with the same problem in &quot;all&quot; internet and can&#039;t find someone with this problem.<br />Who can help me?<br />Thank you in advance</p>									</div>
