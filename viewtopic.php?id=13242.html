					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a WRT54G v5 wireless router. Trying to upgrade firmware (via web) something happened (I didn&#039;t unplug anything and power didn&#039;t go down... it simply failed showing an error message on the browser at the middle of the uploading process) and then router became a useless brick with power led blinking (DMZ led doesn&#039;t flash) and all LAN leds are working good accordingly to eth cables plugged behind. I wanted to upgrade to the last factory default and then to OpenWRT firmware. I know, it&#039;s stupid and useless, but sometimes I&#039;m too much methodical... of course, in a stupid way <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>My laptop is connected to the router by a 3com switch (I read that is a good thing, for some reasons) and is running WinXP (and that probably is not as good).<br />Unfortunately, router doesn&#039;t reply ping requests (I tried with both default factory and my own personal value, used before firmware upgrading); I think that here is the problem.</p><p>I searched all over the forum to find helps... I learnt a lot about but I coldn&#039;t fix the problem: the router is still a brick.</p><p>Here what I&#039;ve tried:<br />before installing OpenWRT I wanted to restore the factory firmware (I&#039;m a little bit scared to lose my loved router).<br />I tried what&#039;s suggested on this wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting#head-024ac87e44e60debe1816e8e1b7ceecddb375cba">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Tro â€¦ cddb375cba</a> using software method and I followed all the instruction of this tutorial. Unfortunately, although I&#039;ve done correctly all the thing suggested, the router still doesn&#039;t work. The ping command window came everytime with the same reply: &quot;request timed out&quot;. I&#039;ve tried many times running tftp right before, right after, at the same time, 1-2-3 seconds after and before the plugging in of the router&#039;s power cable, but no one reply is different from &quot;request timed out&quot;. I&#039;ve said it before, but I want to underline that DMZ led doesnt work, it seems dead (what does it mean?).</p><p>I&#039;ve read (here and elsewhere) that there is an hardware procedure that may help in cases like this one. Opening the router and using a screwdriver to bridge over 15th-16thpins (or 16th-17th, I&#039;m not sure about it; I guess it depends on router&#039;s version). Someone talk about it like a &quot;failsafe mode entering procedure&quot; but FAQS here seem to contraddict it. However, is it a possible way to resolve my problem? If there are no other options, I&#039;ll try it, but I would be sure about it. Moreover I&#039;m not sure to be capable of locate these pins.</p><p>I hope you professional guys could help me.<br />Thank you all</p><p>Luca</p><p>P.s.: oh... sorry for my bad english, i&#039;m italian</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dolfiz</strong> on 2 Nov 2007, 14:45)</p>
