					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>I&#039;m running OpenWRT (Kamikaze build, r5464) on an Asus WL-500G Premium router. It has an Asus WL-120G V2AE Broadcom-based miniPCI card (BCM4318). I&#039;d like to report success with stock OpenWRT 2.6.17-something kernel.</p><p>The router is currently connecting in 11Mbps and 54Mbps modes to an Atheros-based access point (no WEP, no WPA, nothing). The distance between antennae is about 1,5 meters. Not really usable, but it works. I&#039;ve been transferring some files over the link. A 32 MB .zip file is dealt with in 43 seconds (11Mbps) or 16 seconds (54Mbps). This equals roughly to 6Mbps and 16Mbps of actual throughput, respectively. If time permits, I will increase the distance between the two and see how it works.</p><p>Best regards!</p>									</div>
