					<p>I assume, but it is not explicit in your question, that the adsl modem is connected to vlan1 (wan) and you access the router via lan (bridge of vlan0 and eth1 wireless).</p><p>Your command &#039;route add -net 10.20.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0&#039; is wrong.<br />A bit of explanation: the pppoe procedure establishes a virtual port ppp0 that bridges directly to the access provider&#039;s gateway. The ppp0 interface as seen from the internet and seen from the router gets ip addresses assigned dynamically, or they can be static, by the access provider.<br />After the packets having been wrapped into the extra ppp protocol layer the ppp0 connection effectively bypasses the modem. So through ppp0 you cannot talk to the modem itself although physically the ppp0 signals travel over the vlan1 (interface) and via the modem.&nbsp; <br />The solution is to also assign an ip adrdress to the vlan1 interface itself that is on the same subnet as the modem&#039;s ip address:</p><p>ifconfig vlan1 10.24.0.1 <br />route add -net 10.24.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev vlan1</p><p>and you&#039;ll be able to ping and access the modem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 22 May 2007, 20:56)</p>

					<p>made a typo in my post (the ip address in the ifconfig command was wrong, sorry) and have corrected it there.</p><p>you write:<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />i added the net to vlan1 with:<br />ifconfig vlan1 10.20.0.0<br />--&gt; modem ip is 10.20.0.254</p><p>and after that i added the route:<br />route add -net 10.24.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev vlan1<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />but in your original post you wrote the modem is on 10.24.0.254 ! So my post applies to that assumption.<br />If you changed the modem&#039;s ip address to 10.20.0.254 the commands would be:<br />ifconfig vlan1 10.20.0.1 <br />route add -net 10.20.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev vlan1</p><p>This works here; if it wouldn&#039;t with you look for the firewall not allowing connection to vlan1 (the scripts often take the interface name from nvram and will find ppp0 as the wan interface). You&#039;d have to add rules to allow communication to the modem on vlan1.</p><p>iptables -A INPUT -i vlan1 -s 10.20.0.1 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# or 10.24.0.1. if that&#039;s on modem&#039;s subnet<br />iptables -A FORWARD -i vlan1 -s 10.20.0.1 -j ACCEPT&nbsp; &nbsp; # or 10.24.0.1. if that&#039;s on modem&#039;s subnet</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 23 May 2007, 12:50)</p>

					<p>hey doddel,</p><p>thx in advance for your reply - now it works fine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> i set the ifconfig device and i added the route and now i can ping the modem on the router. i also set the iptables settings in my firewall settings.</p><p>but my client-pc can&#039;t ping the modem... the pc doesn&#039;t knows the route (i think). by default normaly the pc should send pakets/pings for unknown networks to the router/gateway and then the router does route, or doesn&#039;t he?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the modem may not be using your router as gateway and doesn&#039;t know the lan subnet.<br />A trick, other than changing modem settings, to get around this is to make any traffic to the modem itself appear as to originate from the router&#039;s vlan1 interface. The modem knows that interface&#039;s subnet and will send the answers back; the router knows your lan and will route the answers back there:</p><p>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o vlan1 -j SNAT --to-source 10.20.0.1 # or 10.24.0.1 if that&#039;s router&#039;s vlan1</p>									</div>
