					<p>AFAICT, any SIPURA device is a stand-alone device that works just fine connected behind a non-symmetrical NAT/Firewall router. What you described on a DD-WRT with MilkFish is an <a href="http://openser.org">OpenSER</a> (or <a href="http://www.opensips.org">OpenSIPS</a>) package. Here on OpenWRT site, we have either packages and other VoIP packages, i.e. <a href="http://www.kamailio.org">Kamailio</a>, <a href="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>, <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a>, and <a href="http://yate.null.ro/pmwiki">Y.A.T.E</a>, to choose from.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 21 Jul 2011, 19:11)</p>

					<p>I have a SPA2102 which I use with OpenWRT.&nbsp; My testing indicates that as long as you have only one SIP device behind your NAT you do not need to do anything for it to work.&nbsp; That is no port forwards or special software needs to be loaded.&nbsp; This is my result using Backfire anyway.</p><p>On my SPA2102 I put the VoIP server from my provider under &quot;Proxy&quot; and I have disabled &quot;Outbound Proxy&quot;.</p><p>If you need more than one SIP device then special sofware like siproxd is needed.</p><p>I used voip.ms as my provider (which I recommend).&nbsp; Not sure about other providers.</p>									</div>
