					<p>Hello everyone. Before purchasing a new router I did a quite a research on what exactly to get.<br />I knew I&#039;ll be installing OpenWRT on my future router and it had to be not just compatible put in active development yet, somewhat new and fast.<br />And because last time I shop for routers WRT54G was the thing (I have 3 of the in fully working order) I was glad to see a familiar face with upgraded looks and internals. WRT1900 , And I managed to get Second version WRT1900ACv2 from what I understand it&#039;s the same version as WRT1900ACS with 1.6Ghz Dual Core CPU (how do I test clock speed ??)<br />Cause on the box it&#039;s said 1.3 yes THIS GUY : <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=987582#987582">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic. … 582#987582</a><br />They&#039;re same hardware.</p><p>Anyhow. Once I found exactly what I need first thing I saw is caution to get serial cable to it&#039;ll help with development and in general good to have if you&#039;re messing with router and it&#039;s almost impossible to brick it if you have serial connection. So I did. I purchased this: <br /><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Arduino-USB-to-COM-RS232-TTL-UART-PL2303HX-Auto-Converter-Cable-Adapter-Module-/111593270026">http://www.ebay.com/itm/Arduino-USB-to- … 1593270026</a></p><p>And it was a bit of a trouble to get it working under Windows 10 but I managed to find correct drivers so device manager no longer showing that Yellow Exclamation mark.</p><p>After reading this guide: <a href="https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wiki/Linksys-WRT1900AC-Serial-Port">https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wi … erial-Port</a></p><p>I quickly opened my unit and just as quick I find out that photos are bit different from actual units. V1 and V2 Serial ports located in save vicinity yet not in the same place and orientation is also different.</p><p>Here are my photos for V2 unit:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60319291/IMG_20160131_230010.jpg" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60319291/IMG_20160131_230010.jpg" /></span><br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60319291/IMG_20160131_230027.jpg" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60319291/IMG_20160131_230027.jpg" /></span></p><p>As you can see it&#039;s a bit different.</p><p>My next move was to determine if pins are identical to V1 version for GND,RX and TX . I don&#039;t see much of info online but they&#039;re the same, few people told me so. Confirm if you know for sure.</p><p>And lastly Actual USB to Serial Cable.</p><p>Because I didn&#039;t know what I know now. I just purchased one that was recommended on the guide above web site but they never said what exactly to get and unfortunately my cable have 2.54 pitch vs 2.0 that&#039;s on the router. Basically speaking my pins are too big. so they won&#039;t fit the router. I just ordered an adapter $6 and I hope this is it.</p><p>This is mine. You how plastic is too wide.<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60319291/IMG_20160131_230722.jpg" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60319291/IMG_20160131_230722.jpg" /></span><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFZK652?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&amp;smid=APC13YWKOQWF">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFZ … C13YWKOQWF</a></p><p>My next project is to put it in and somehow make it secure so even if one of my cats pull the wire it wont just pull out. Also I think I&#039;ll need to make one of the holes bigger because as it is right now wire will not fit thru hole. If anyone have a good guide on how to make secure connection to route and sneak it from router in neat matter let me know.</p><p>Good luck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xakep</strong> on 1 Feb 2016, 06:33)</p>
