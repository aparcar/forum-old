					<p>I&#039;m trying to use a WDR3600 v1.5 as a router for my gigabit WAN connection (fibre).</p><p>When handling large amount of traffic the WAN port link starts to drop intermittently. This is visible on the Network &gt; Switch page of OpenWrt and through swconfig in the shell.</p><p>The scenario that seems to trigger the &#039;no link&#039; is when the remote host (like in a Skype call over WiFi on the receiving end) has varying latency and/or gets overwhelmed by the amount of traffic. When the scenario triggers packets loss rises up to 40% (Skype call information) and then the &#039;No link&#039; icon appears on the OpenWrt switch page. After half a second or so the link returns to 1 gbit but the connection will keep hicking up until the amount of traffic being routed is reduced.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/mirrors/openwrt/blob/master/target/linux/ar71xx/files/drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/ag71xx/ag71xx.h">ethernet ring buffers in source</a> seem to be set fairly low; 32 for the tx and 128 for the rx. I tried setting them to 256/256 and while this increased the speed up to 170mbps of NAT&#039;ed traffic instead of the default 130mbps with speedtest.net it does not mitigate the problem.</p><p>It&#039;s driving my slightly crazy so ANY help would be greatly appreciated. I really love OpenWrt for the amount of functionality it offers in stark contrast to the factory firmware.</p><p>Thanks for reading <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>TLDR; gigabit WAN connection drops link when internet traffic becomes congested</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sWp</strong> on 17 May 2014, 14:05)</p>

					<p>Hi, I use my 1043nd as an AP, so the WAN port was unused. Recently I thought I could delete the WAN interface and use that port as a standard LAN port, but I got the same behaviour you report, i.e. random cuts lasting no more than 30 seconds. Regular LAN ports don&#039;t show this behaviour.<br />Any clues?</p>									</div>
