					<p>Hi everyone, I have heard great things about this open source linux route OS and am glad to finally be buying equipment to take advantage of this great peace of software!</p><p>The problem is hat I&#039;m not sure what hardware is best suited for me...</p><p>I am swtiching from AT&amp;T to Comcast Xfinity ISP and will be experiencing cable internet&nbsp; in my home for the first time. I will get the 100mb plan and have decided to buy my own equipment, problem is I have no idea what is worth buying :)</p><p>I&#039;ve been doing some googling and found that the Arris SB6141 and the NETGEAR CM400 are popular choices for cable modems and looked at a few routers like the Archer C7 and the TP-Link N450 but am not sure what hardware I would&nbsp; be better off going with. </p><p>I&#039;m a poor collage student preparing for my Computer science and networking education so I really would like to get the right hardware for the job, that being said I am als working within a budget and woud like to spend less then $200 unless there is a&nbsp; good reason to justify spending more then that.</p><p>Thanks for reading! I hope to get an idea of what makes a good cable modem and router combo and why, this will be a good way to start to understand more about the hardware that makes up my LAN :)</p>									</div>
