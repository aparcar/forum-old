					<p>The sysupgrade of myWRT1200ACv1 from r4901 to r6520 with &#039;keep settings&#039; worked without problems and I am back on the internet after about 4 minutes of work. I have yet to check the logs or tweak things like dnscrypt that probably is different after 6 months. The wifi, lan and wan is working and so now there is no hurry to work on any other problems if any.</p><p>Thanks davidc502.</p>									</div>

					<p>Did an upgrade from stock Linksys fw to r6520 on my wrt3200acm without any trouble...all is working well (including wifi). P.S. I always keep Linksys fw on one partition for safety reasons.</p><p>I had all but given up on this router, as many others have. Constant wifi drops with stock linksys fw, dd-wrt, and earlier lede releases were extremely frustrating. However, beginning with experimental build r6365, that all changed. My wrt3200acm performed like a router should for the first time ever! Thank you David!</p>									</div>

Which I think will be soon, by how much headway has been done for both 1900AC/v1 and 3200 series. You have a bunch of 32x guys chomping at the bit, even if they end up down grading to 3200acm features with your builds. Maybe a patch can be done later to up do the basic test build to 32x mimo features can be done later and applied to both 3200 and 32x series. Just thinking out loud, for all them dealing with issues and no real support.</p>									</div>

That is why I choose to do clean installs with the best available for stability and upgradabilty. </p><p>One rule of thumb handed down from years of testing and support. It is best to&nbsp; maintain a good base install and save settings once setup, then wait for a stable build to upgrade to. If by chance there are many builds in between,&nbsp; you may have to upgrade from an intermediate build to make sure settings are passed on properly and adjust if needed, then save your new settings for the upgrade you planned on installing. It may take doing another intermediate build if needed. Eventually you will have a settings file compatible for the later builds until another big change happens, and your back to doing the process with intermediate build updates once again.</p><p>Not many keep a stash of all working builds available for general use, like linksys. Fortunately David has a good collection of builds to progressively update from. </p><p>I have not kept up on all this thread, but i&nbsp; would assume David would state which new build, when it&#039;s is released past testing, will not work with older versions settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Notsofast</strong> on 25 Mar 2018, 18:34)</p>
