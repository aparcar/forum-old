					<p>Why do you want USB? Other than setting up some sort of breakout device to connect to your POTS network, I don&#039;t see the need for USB.<br />you can run asterisk on the WRT54GL - u just subscribe to Vonage or one of those services that does break-out for the VOIP.</p><p>When you get a VOIP device, get one that supports SIP, then you can set it to use the WRT as the SIP server</p><p>Asterisk is pretty heavy tho, if you want to use mp3 voicemail messages etc. I suggest you either mount an external fs for the WRT54GL, or go for a higher spec&#039;d device (storage wise) like the ASUS RItalMan mentioned. Its got more space and RAM and is proll&#039;y a better bet than the linksys.</p>									</div>

					<p>booBot</p><p>but how is it better than WRT54GL or similar with VoIP adapter separately? My router is in the garage (because all the wires come there) and one of the wires go to the living room where SPA-2002 is attached to the phone base. So, I wouldn&#039;t salivate over Router/VoIP combo.</p><p>So, for a plain ability to make phone calls (outgoing) and to receive an incoming calls too it works perfectly well.</p><p>I was thinking of plugging USB hard drive for asterisk and fancy voicemails (I am a little hesitant to put asterisk on the router), so in the hindsight I would consider WRTSL54GS instead.

Use softphone (X-Lite, or one of proprietary, such as Skype or VoipDiscount). Then WRT54GL is the only device that you need. You can optionally set up QoS on it - and you are all set. That will conclude your VoIP project, but doesn&#039;t make the router &quot;a VoIP box&quot;. The drawbacks - you have to be near your computer with headsets/microphone and your computer must be on to send or receive calls. I think there are also some USB or BlueTooth phones that you can use with such setup. </p><p>2. Use WRT54GL &lt;==&gt; ATA configuration. ATA is analog telephone adapter, such as Sipura/Linksys SPA. That&#039;s the setup that I am using - suites my needs perfectly. Or, you can use&nbsp; Router/ATA combo such as the one that you linked to. </p><p>3. Have some SIP or Asterisk client running on a router, and USB/BT as interface to a BT phone. OpenWRT comes with OpenSER and Asterisk, so if you go for it - share your experience. I haven&#039;t seen anybody running such configuration, so I was afraid to be the first to try. There are a few routers with USB port, such as Asus models or Linksys WRTSL54GS</p><p>Hope that helps<br />Good luck!</p>									</div>
