					<p>Use &#039;lsusb&#039; to see if your device is detected by the USB host controller. If it is, and you have the debugfs system in use, then you should be able to check &#039;cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices | less&#039; to determine which driver is currently loaded for your device. If debugfs system is not available, use the instructions at <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60078/find-out-which-modules-are-associated-with-a-usb-device">this link</a> for an alternative method on how to determine which driver is loaded for your device.</p><p>If the output shows that no driver is loaded, check if you have &#039;kmod-usb-acm&#039; installed. That package provides the kernel-level support for <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/acm.txt">Linux Abstract Control Model</a> aka ACM.</p><p>This should get you to a point where &#039;/dev/ttyACM0&#039; appears in the device tree. It does not guarantee that your device will work, but at least it&#039;s a step forward.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 8 Feb 2018, 12:44)</p>
