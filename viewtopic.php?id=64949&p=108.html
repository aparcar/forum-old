					<p>Is anyone else having issues with WDS clients on the 3200ACM? I can&#039;t get my 1900AC or 1900AC v2 to connect to my 3200ACM and pass data. They connect but RX remains at 48Mbis and TX at 1300Mbits on the 1900&#039;s. The 3200ACM shows 6Mbits on each from each router. I am running davids current builds for each on all of my routers. I have installed bridge and nothing seems to be working. All my other devices remain stable and connected. Is there something I can do to fix this, or is this driver related (dealing with WDS)?</p>									</div>
