					<p>I have searched all around and cannot find an answer to my question. I have OpenWRT 12.09 running on a Buffalo AG300H. What I want to do is have individual SSIDs assigned to specific VLANs, then trunk all of those VLANs up to a separate server that will handle DHCP, etc.. Essentially, I want to make it so that if you connect to one certain SSID, you will get access to the LAN and some NAS devices. Another SSID will offer prioritized QoS for video streaming. A third SSID will offer a transparent proxy to the TOR network. A fourth one will route all traffic through a VPN. I want to have my firewall / home server to do the heavy lifting, and really just want OpenWRT to handle the wireless side. I tried several vlan configurations, but cannot seem to get any vlan traffic to work at all.</p><p>My main question is first: is this setup even really possible? Can I just have OpenWRT bridge each VAP with its assigned VLAN and then send it all up the trunk port?</p><p>Second: I have tried several variations of this and none have worked. The main setup I tried that did not work was to create a new VAP, bridge the VAP with eth0.6, assign both the trunk port (I was using the first lan port) and the cpu port 0 to vlan 6 with tagging set for both. I then assigned 10.0.6.1 as the network interface. When I tried this, I was unable to get packets through, and was unable to even ping OpenWRT. I tried ssh&#039;ing into the router and manually setting up the vlan interfaces (by setting both cpu port 0 and the lan port as tagged members of vlan 6), and then plugging in my laptop to the same lan port, and manually setting the laptop&#039;s adapter to the same subnet using the vconfig (assigning the ip address to eth0.6) This did not work, I was unable to ping the router via the interface. I made sure to shut down the firewall completely while I was testing this.</p><p>Third: can I run the WAN port (eth1) as the trunk port, or do I have to trunk over one of the LAN ports (eth0)?</p><p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tdb</strong> on 25 Nov 2013, 22:42)</p>

					<p>Sure, it&#039;s possible - I am doing precisely that. I&#039;m using Kamikaze 8.09 because broadcom multi-ssid is broken with the opensource driver (at least in white russian and backfire - I don&#039;t even know if attitude adjustment will run on my wrt54g devices), and proto-less interfaces are broken with earlier versions of Kamikaze. Note that you need to set the unique ifbssid for each ssid and some other hacking is also required - if you decide to use 8.09 then I will go into more detail.</p><p>I firewall the vlans at the trunk on my openbsd router.</p><br /><p>/etc/config/network</p><p># Switch and VLANs<br />config switch eth0<br />&nbsp;

					<p>Thank you very much for your config files. I am getting a better understanding of how to set it up from them. I have pretty much only tried it with LuCI so far. A few points:</p><p>1. What is your turnk port, a lan port or WAN port? The AG300H has a different set up with the cpu on port 0, and the WAN port as a separate interface. </p><p>2. I noticed that you are only tagging on one vlan for port 5. Isn&#039;t that the cpu port? How is the cpu seeing the other traffic on the untagged vlans it is in? </p><p>3. Has anyone done something like this using my hardware? I have read a few places where some of the athros based hardware had unique issues with vlan. I actually just installed dd wrt on the box, and the Web interface doesn&#039;t even give me the option to configure vlans like openwrt does.</p>									</div>

					<p>Remember, my configuration is for 8.09 and the syntax for networks has changed a bit in recent versions, so unless you are using 8.09 you can&#039;t use my config directly as a template.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>tdb wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>1.

The AG300H has a different set up with the cpu on port 0, and the WAN port as a separate interface.</p></blockquote></div><p>First of all, it&#039;s important to note that with this particular device, WRT54GL, the &quot;LAN Ports 1-4&quot; are switch ports 0-3, the WAN port is switch port 4, and the CPU is switch port 5. It really doesn&#039;t matter which physical interface you use as an uplink port, just that it needs to be tagged for all uplinked VLANs.</p><p>As you see, I tagged port 4 for every VLAN except for 0 (LAN) and 1 (WAN). VLAN 0 has 192.168.1.1 which I can connect to if I take my laptop, configure a manual IP address and plug into one of the &quot;LAN&quot; ports on the back of the router - this is just an emergency management interface. VLAN 1 is set to the WAN port because that is the VLAN PVID on my HP switch (switch port includes all the same VLANs that are on the router and the switch port is set to &quot;Tagged Only&quot;). Because the WAN port is a VLAN trunk, I do not want a proto running on the interface itself. My management network (for my entire network) is on VLAN 4, so you see I setup a virtual bridge interface for VLAN 4 on which I put my router&#039;s management IP address.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>tdb wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2.

					<p>Just an update: I was never able to get this set up to work, even using the wan port as a trunk port. My next attempt is just to use vtun and have it carry all of the tagged traffic since I cannot get the hardware to do it. I&#039;ll try that and see if it works. If so, I&#039;ll report back how I did it so anyone else who wants to try the setup can get it.</p>									</div>
