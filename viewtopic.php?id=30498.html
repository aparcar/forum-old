					<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>I have a WRT54GL with Backfire 10.03.1 RC4 and I&#039;d like to set up a repeater bridge (like the one from DD-WRT) with WPA2 support.<br />The wiki, the forum and google are a great help but I only found solutions with different subnets OR the same subnet but without the actual repeater mode (only client bridge).</p><p>With DD-WRT I only have to select &quot;Repeater bridge&quot; for the first wifi device and then create a second, virtual, one which acts as AP. It works great.<br />With Backfire I tried something similar. First device (wl0) was &quot;client&quot; and the second device (wl0.1) was &quot;AP&quot;. Unfortunately this didn&#039;t worked.</p><p>WDS is not a solution because the main router is a &quot;Speedport&quot; and it doesn&#039;t seem to support WDS.</p><br /><p>Can anyone help me with this?</p><p>Thanks a lot! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Cypher</p>									</div>
