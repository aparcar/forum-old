					<p>I recently installed &quot;OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)&quot; on my Asus RT-N56U router, and find that the router quite frequently stops responding, and I end up pulling the power cable to get it back up and running. </p><p>There&#039;s always a lot of different things that may be causing such issues, and a vast amount of things to do to troubleshoot the issue. </p><p>I&#039;m sure others here have had the same type of issue, and I&#039;d very much like some advice on how to start troubleshooting this starting from the most likely problem. I&#039;m working on getting some sort of logging up and running, and I guess this will be the very first step towards understanding what&#039;s going on, but please advice on other thing to look into. </p><p>Best regards,<br />kenneho</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kenneho</strong> on 5 Jun 2016, 21:23)</p>

					<p>Thanks, I&#039;ll give that a try. When I installed the firmware I simply followed the instructions over at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n56u,">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/rt-n56u,</a> without checking if that was the latest release. </p><p>I&#039;ll install <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ramips/rt3883/openwrt-15.05.1-ramips-rt3883-rt-n56u-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ actory.bin</a> as soon as I get the chance, and see if that helps.</p>									</div>
