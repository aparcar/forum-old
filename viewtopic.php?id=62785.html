					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have done a couple hours research and require some guidance:</p><p>I want to make sure that if someone removes my sdcard (from my Raspberry Pi 2, which is running Openwrt), places it in an SD card reader and opens it on their PC (ubuntu, whatever), that the SD card files are not accessible. </p><p>This is almost what I want to do - <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/disk.encryption">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/disk.encryption</a> - my only issue is that I am trying to encryption the SD card that the actual OS is on, not a USB drive for example.</p><p>Any ideas would be great!</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mulletman87</strong> on 16 Feb 2016, 21:58)</p>

I have put together this process:</p><p>1) Create two partitions on the SD card (second one will be encrypted later)<br />2) Place openwrt on the first one and install all OUR necessary packages, dependencies, scripts, etc. as per normal. Make sure that nothing autostarts with the OS boot.<br />3) Cut all necessary packages, dependencies, scripts, etc. to second partition and create symlinks from old locations to point to the new locations.<br />4) Encrypt the second partition and store the private key on a cloud server.<br />5) Put a script in the boot process to authenticate with that specific RPi&#039;s userID, pull the private key from our server via an encrypted channel (SSH is fine) and to decrypt the second partition. <br />6) Put another script that runs after decryption to start all services, scripts, etc. that are on the second partition.</p><p>If I didn&#039;t do it this way, i presume that I could just hide the decryption key on the non-encrypted partition but that would blow a hole in the security.&nbsp; </p><p>Is this the best way to do it?</p>									</div>

					<p>@sok and others, any other suggestions on the best way about protecting my personal assets (not the OS, that will remain free as it always is) on the SD Card? I will do the heavy lifting, I just want to make sure that I am lifting the right weight. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
