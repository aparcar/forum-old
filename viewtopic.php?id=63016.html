					<p>If we&#039;d list all manufacturer using OpenWrt in some way, the hardware list would be way longer. The wiki only lists devices supported by the official OpenWrt codebase.</p><p>Netgear e.g. uses OpenWrt for a lot of their routers as well, but that doesn&#039;t mean OpenWrt supports all those models - alas.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well that is very flattering that sellers are taking on the firmware without anyone even getting involved, or I guess it would be considered an honor?&nbsp; For the lowly experienced newcomer to OpenWRT, it is a bit confusing.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you are saying there is a much larger list that OpenWRT works on but that no support tickets will be accepted for .... is that the defining line?&nbsp; &nbsp;(Haven&#039;t been here long enough to understand the structure of the organization.)</p><p>I wonder how the seller will handle updates, or will the unsuspecting buyer just be stuck with the one release they deliver and you&#039;ll be on your on after that?&nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of open holes.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s often laziness and more of an insult than a compliment. It&#039;s just a lot cheaper for them to use FOSS instead of developing something themselves (or purchasing closed alternatives). Companies often sell their hardware with OpenWrt or Linux, but do not release the sources as per the GPL (or only partially). They use the hard work of the OpenWrt and FOSS communities, but do not contribute anything back. The majority of the devices OpenWrt supports have been ported by the OpenWrt community without any help from their respective manufacturers.</p><p>In general, OEMs barely handle updates. They prefer features over security, they&#039;ll poop out some firmware updates, but not to fix security holes. So yes, most of them will take your money, but leave you to your own devices, similar to smartphone manufacturers.</p><p>Excuse my french.</p>									</div>

					<p>you are right. now there will be several hundreds of MT7620 models around with similar specs, yet no one can&#039;t figure out to include basic thing like Gbit ports.</p>									</div>
