					<p>If your main AP has WDS capability, then your 350n setup a STA(client) WDS to connect to your main AP,<br />then in 350n, bridge other AP WDS together with the STA WDS ; you can bridge more than one AP(wds) if you needed, and also can use different ssid.<br />then those AP(should use wds) in your 350n will pass traffics to your main AP, as a result used as wifi bridge(different ssid) and repeater(same ssid).</p><p>If your main AP doesn&#039;t have WDS capability.<br />the 350n need to install relayd....... the configuration is a bit complicate.</p><p>openwrt wiki have the information.</p>									</div>
