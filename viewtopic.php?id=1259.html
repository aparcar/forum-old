					<p>Is there a firmware hack for the WRT54GS that will turn WiFi on and off independent of the 10/100bT, according to a predetermined schedule?</p><p>I spend way too much time on the &#039;net, perhaps I&#039;m suffering from borderline internet-addiction, but I still need occasional &#039;net access for my banking and schooling. My Linksys router is stashed upstairs with my landlord (whose &#039;net connection I share) so I don&#039;t have convenient physical access to it. I&#039;d like for the 10/100bT connection to remain active while the WiFi is disabled, since my landlord&#039;s PC is connected via 10/100bT and I use the WiFi. That would restrict the time I waste on the net, especially since I don&#039;t have a landline for dialup access.</p><p>I haven&#039;t hacked OpenWRT or its equivalents before but might be willing to try if this is easy to do -- i.e. through existing packages, cron jobs or shell scripting. I am not up to the task of kernel hacking or writing a new package.</p>									</div>
