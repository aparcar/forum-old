					<p>Other than this being an Open WRT forum and not DD WRT, poke around in the UI and have fun. If your 54gs is like mine it is very hard to brick provided you can tftp a new .bin to it.</p><p>edit: btw which gs do you have? I think only the v1 had 4MB flash(which in theory could use Open WRT) the rest were all 2MB.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tului</strong> on 11 Feb 2011, 01:59)</p>
