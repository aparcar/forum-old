					<p>Hi, is there any possibility to configure link aggregation on kamikaze (r13670). In other words I have one cross cable from router to the switch. But there are 12 pc or appliances in that switch. And the routers interface is only 100 mbit. also there is another one switch with 6 other pcs connected through second cross cable. but if the pcs on first switch try to acces some resources on the other switch there is an significant congestion on that one 100 mbit lan interface. So i need to config it somehow so it will use more lan ports as one big uplnik to the switch (like it is possible on cisco switches). also all pc must be in the same vlan so breaking the inner lan via vlans is not the way to go. as far as i know simply pluging another cables to the switches will not work due to inevitable broadcast storm. thanx</p>									</div>
