					<p>I have an Asus RT-N56U onto which I installed OpenWrt Chaos Calmer version 15.05.1.</p><p>Everything seems to work OK, but I need the ability to WOL from the internet and I had a really hard time setting this up with OpenWrt.&nbsp; I have other routers that are supported by dd-wrt an they were always relatively easy to set up for WOL over the internet.</p><p>Basically, you have to set up port forwarding for UDP port 9 to go to some unused ip address in your subnet (like 192.168.1.254).&nbsp; Then you need to create an ARP mapping from whatever ip addess you just forwarded to the broadcast MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) so that your magic packet can be sent to all hosts on your local network.</p><p>So I did this in OpenWrt but WOL would not work outside my local network.&nbsp; After spending a lot of time on this (basically because I know very little about Linux systems) I was able to verify that my port forwarding was working just fine.&nbsp; My ARP entry, however, was not being created so I started focusing on that.</p><p>From a shell session, if I executed the command that I had put in my startup script (at /etc/rc.local)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip neigh add 192.168.1.254 lladdr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff nud permanent dev br-lan</code></pre></div><p>then the ARP entry would be created and WOL over the internet worked just fine.</p><p>Eventually I came to the conclusion that I may be running into a race condition and perhaps my startup ip command was being run before the ip package was initialized.&nbsp; To test this I put a sleep command before my ip command in rc.local</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sleep 2
ip neigh add 192.168.1.254 lladdr ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff nud permanent dev br-lan</code></pre></div><p>and after a reboot the ARP entry was being created!</p><p>This is good news, but I am wondering if there is a better way to code this.&nbsp; Sleeping for some static amount of time is never a good solution for dealing with a race condition.&nbsp; Does anyone know of any way either through brute force polling or some more sophisticated event mechanism to determine when the ip package is available to be used so that I can assure that I never jump the gun when issuing my ip command?</p>									</div>
