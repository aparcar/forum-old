					<p>So, I am quite the amateur when it comes to CLI types of interfaces so, i will need some help!<br />Now, I have fiddled around with updates, etc. on the forum with how-tos and i have the latest version of OpenWRT.<br />Even after updating, i assume there is no direct web interface and the only way to actually access the router is through telnet (when in the safe boot) and by SSH (from a standard boot).&nbsp; But the CLI style doesn&#039;t work for me it only allows me to use Ethernet and i can&#039;t manage to even access the configuration files.&nbsp; So, if someone could help, I NEED TO REMOVE The firmware and replace it with something else!!!&nbsp; Also, i have tried and tried hundreds of times (really No joke) to TFTP the router and update the firmware no luck! </p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p><p>Matt</p><p>(By the way, i have a Linksys WRT54GS V.4)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>andersonmat</strong> on 5 Nov 2007, 01:36)</p>
