					<p>Hi Everyone!</p><p>Sorry I&#039;m new to all this but basically trying to add latency to simulate a online game when playing over LAN..</p><p>I&#039;ve installed a kmod-netem package on the router but I keep getting an error saying &quot;RTNETLINK answers: No such file or directory&quot; when trying to run the command to add latency, I&#039;m very tech savvy but I&#039;m not too great with OpenWrt, I&#039;ve got the Alfa AP121u Router and as far as I am aware the Attitude 12.9 is the only version that works with it but I cannot find much about how to get netem working on this version.</p><p>Will I need to buy a different router to get this going or is it possible? I see that I have iptables installed but I think I may need iptables2? But I cannot find an install command that seems to work for that and its not in the list through the router GUI.</p><p>Any help or advise will be appreciated I hate to ask general questions like this but I have spent a few hours of my weekend begrudgingly looking around on the web to no avail so even a pointer to a good TUT on it would be appreciated but nothing I have found/tried has worked so far.</p><p>If anyone wants to make a couple dollars I am happy to donate if someone is willing to show me over a remote connection or skype or something too (I hate to sound like a sponge!)</p><p>Thanks for any advise!</p><p>Dave</p>									</div>
