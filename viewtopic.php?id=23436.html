					<p>Sorry for post this across forum, but I really need help with this one:</p><p>The aim for me is to have mac address cloning enable for wireless adapter on Nanostation loco 2.</p><p>First thing I do is to use default Luci GUI to set the interface for Device wifi0 to be WAN and change the Mac Address of the WAN interface. However, this only changes the mac address of Device ath0. Also, it shows that interface WAN is connected with Device ath0 in the interface status page in Luci.</p><p>Then I go into the config file and tried to change the network file under etc/config and add the macaddr option for the WAN interface, it didn&#039;t work either.</p><p>And as I dig in deeper, I found a file &quot;address&quot; under &quot;sys/devices/virtual/net/wifi0&quot;, I think that is the place stores the mac address for the wifi0, but I cann&#039;t change the content of the file even I change the access to writable as the vi shows cannot read all content.</p><p>So, Here comes all the questions:<br />1. why Wan is shown to be attached to ath0 even if I assigned it to wifi0? (I tried change wifi0 into ath0 in the config and the wireless didn&#039;t work)<br />2. I think nvram is not supported in 8.09, then how can I change the content of the files under &quot;sys/devices/virtual/net/wifi0&quot;.</p><p>Thanks for any help offered</p>									</div>
