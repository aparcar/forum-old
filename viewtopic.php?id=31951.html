					<p>Hello,<br />I have a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v1.8 router with OpenWRT on it.</p><p>It works very good and quite stable to PC which is directly connected through cable and other notebooks on WiFi. Also, the web configuration through LuCI and Dropbear (SSH) works good but only on LAN. If i try to connect remotely SSH just drops the connection (using PuTTY) - &quot;Network error: Connection refused&quot;. Also, i have tried with connect to SSH (port 22) from my android phone but the result is the same - &quot;Connection Lost. domain.name/ip.address - Connection refused&quot;.</p><p>Also, i have forwarded the Remote Desktop port to connect to my home desktop PC from my work PC. But there are no success also.</p><p>May be there are any restrictions to connect remotely by default? I have searched in the OpenWRT forum, on Google also, but i have not found anything useful yet.</p><p>Looking forward to hear any solution, please.</p>									</div>

					<p>Is it necessary to open web (port 80) access through WAN to use SSH from remote? Because i have added the second rule only using ssh (on local LAN) using &#039;vi&#039; and have restarted &#039;firewall&#039; process. But i still can not connect remotely...<br />I would not prefer to open web port (port 80) for public access.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just add the rule and that&#039;s it. Do you really have public ip on wan port? Maybe your ISP blocks port 22. Try to edit /etc/config/dropbear and cange ssh to other port, such as 2222 and open port 2222. This will affect your port on lan side too, but it is easier to configure.</p><p>If your port is properly open you can test on the grc shields up page (google).</p>									</div>
