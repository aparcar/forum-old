					<p>crossposted at &#039;gtk-devel-list@gnome.org&#039;</p><p>Folks;</p><p>I am attempting to update to more modern versions of gtk+ for OpenWrt (target-x86_64_glibc-2.13).</p><p>Question #1: Have I selected the correct versions, end of life for gtk+2, just prior to gtk+3?</p><p>Question #2:&nbsp; Both packages xcompile OK, but install fails with:</p><p>“bin/install: missing file operand” whether I use libtool, autoconf or autoreconf</p><p>It seems to be an autoconf/reconfigure problem, and googling “install: missing file operand” unhelpful.</p><p>Anyone willing to take a look at this?</p><p>I have placed the build logs online, search bin/install for failure:</p><p><a href="http://www.rossco.org/gtk+-2.20.10_build.txt">http://www.rossco.org/gtk+-2.20.10_build.txt</a></p><p><a href="http://www.rossco.org/gdk-pixbuf-2.24.1_build.txt">http://www.rossco.org/gdk-pixbuf-2.24.1_build.txt</a></p><p>You will note, at the end of logs, an attempt to work around this by copying the binaries into the package. Also bin/install has been replaced by a wrapper script to capture cmdline. In several calls, no parameters, hence “missing file operand”</p><p>Also, am able to provide ssh access to build system and collaborate with someone who wants to take a serious look at this, in addition to additional information. Hopefully, it is a simple problem.</p><p>Thanks;<br />Bill Ross<br />rossb residing at sympatico.ca</p>									</div>
