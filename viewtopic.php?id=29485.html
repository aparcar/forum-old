					<p>For information, the only things i do after installing kamikaze firmware was assing the router ip, the gateway adress and dhcp parameters.</p><p>I pressed the reboot button on router&#039;s browser page, and can&#039;t login after that, but router seams to work properly and it assings the ip adresses of my computers and respond to the ping.</p><br /><p>I can&#039;t belive it was bricked, because i think i don&#039;t touched nothing special to do that...</p><p>Please can you give me some help on that?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
