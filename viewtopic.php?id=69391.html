					<p>Hi!</p><p>I recently purchased a Routeboard RB493GAH with the intention of running OpenWRT to replace my aging D-link.</p><p>I&#039;ve managed to netboot both 14.07 and, after some fiddling (compiling my own since there&#039;s no initramfs for 15.05.1) 15.05.1. In both cases, I&#039;m having trouble getting traffic through on the leftmost 4 switchports, the ones connected to switch0.</p><p>If I connect a laptop, I see it making DHCPDISCOVER in its logs, and with tcpdump on eth0 (which is switch0&#039;s interface), I see it come in, and I see the reply going out - but the laptop doesn&#039;t see the reply. </p><p>Traffic on switch1 is completely fine.</p><p>Using swconfig, I see that the switch claims the port is up, with the same mode (1Gbit/s, full duplex) as the laptop see at its end. </p><p>I&#039;m confused. Any hints?</p><p>Thanks!<br />\EF</p>									</div>

					<p>Still very confused. I just rebooted into RouterOS and managed to configure a bridge between two interfaces, works like a charm. </p><p>But under OpenWRT 15.05.1, there&#039;s no traffic coming out through the switch.</p><p>If I configure a static IP (192.168.1.161) on my laptop and try to ping 192.168.1.1, I see that the laptop is sending out:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>21:18:50.557155 ARP, Request who-has 192.168.1.1 tell 192.168.1.161, length 28</code></pre></div><p>But it&#039;s getting no replies.</p><p>On OpenWRT I see, if doing tcpdump on eth0 which is the switch&#039;s interface:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>21:18:50.548798 ARP, Request who-has OpenWrt.lan tell 192.168.1.161, length 46
21:18:50.548896 ARP, Reply OpenWrt.lan is-at 6c:3b:6b:21:73:01 (oui Unknown), length</code></pre></div><p>So as far as I understand, OpenWRT gets the ARP request, replies to it, sends it to the switch, but then it mysteriously disappears. </p><p>Help!</p>									</div>
