					<p>Hello All<br />I am new to all this:-<br />I have been reading book and got some confusion:-</p><p>I was reading &quot;Understanding linux networking Internal&quot; book and the pdf &quot;Network packet capture in Linux kernelspace&quot; on the link&nbsp; <a href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fberaldoleal.com%2Ftalks%2Fnetworkkernel.pdf&amp;ei=-GldUdeUMNHhrAe8tYDoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe8_oYRoolrVi1o9d8sOT2EV5Dbg&amp;sig2=7D4GBkYZDKWiVTZiNBgzag&amp;bvm=bv.44770516,d.bmk&amp;cad=rja">https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;r … mp;cad=rja</a></p><p>In the &quot;Understanding linux networking Internal&quot; under topic 9.2.2 it is given that <br />The code that takes care of an input frame is split into two parts: first the driver copies the frame into an input queue accessible by the kernel, and then the kernel processes it (usually passing it to a handler dedicated to the associated protocol such as IP). The first part is executed in interrupt context and can preempt the execution of the second part.</p><p>Now the query is when the 2nd part is scheduled?<br />I mean how scheduler schedule it,does scheduler call to any process or thread in which the 2nd part is done?</p><p>in &quot;Network packet capture in Linux kernel space&quot; the&nbsp; packet input flow is described as:-<br />When working in interrupt driven model, the nic registers an<br />interrupt handler;<br />• This interrupt handler will be called when a frame is received;<br />• Typically in the handler, we allocate sk buff by calling<br />dev alloc skb();<br />• Copies data from nic’s buffer to this struct just created;<br />• nic call generic reception routine netif rx();<br />• netif rx() put frame in per cpu queue;<br />• if queue is full, drop!<br />• net rx action() decision based on skb-&gt;protocol;<br />• This function basically dequeues the frame and delivery a copy<br />for every protocol handler;<br />• ptype all and ptype base queues</p><br /><p>I want to know when&nbsp; netif rx(); and net rx action() are called?<br />Does net rx action()&nbsp; is called in interrupt handler itself?</p><p>Who call them i mean who schedule them.</p><p>Whats the packet reception if we use NAPI?</p>									</div>

					<p>Typically the minimal amount of work is done in the context of an interrupt, then a &quot;kernel work item&quot; is scheduled and the interrupt handler exits. The kernel itself manages the queue of work items.</p>									</div>

					<p>Jeffster sir thanks for the reply but please tell me How the &quot;kernel work item&quot; is scheduled i mean does any thread schedule it or any process?<br />How do the kernel know that to schedule &quot;kernel work item&quot;.</p>									</div>
