					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have an Raspberry PI I would like to use with OpenWrt. My problem is that I don&#039;t have a monitor or a USB keyboard. <br />When using Rasberian (default Raspberry PI OS), SSH is enabled by default and I can set it up over SSH from another computer.</p><p>Is this possible with OpenWrt?</p>									</div>

					<p>I would assume that OpnWRT acts like OpenWRT, even on a RasPi.<br />On <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin">first login</a> via telnet you set your password. After that, telnet will be deactivated and from then on you will have to login with ssh.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Samweis</strong> on 22 Nov 2013, 22:55)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m curious how you would even know you had OpenWrt correctly installed?<br />I use the hdmi connection to a monitor to boot up. There is access to serial pins on the header also<br />to attach a usb serial port adapter to use a standard pc or laptop. From there as said above<br />you can use a telnet session to first login.</p><p><a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection">http://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johnisaacson</strong> on 22 Nov 2013, 23:26)</p>

					<p>You can do everything you need with a serial terminal including setting up network and ssh. If you have any kind of a problem and it doesn&#039;t boot up perfectly then you are unable to see the problem. Lastly it is cheap in that all you need is a rs232 device to usb (carefull of the voltages ie 3.3 versus 5v) and a terminal program on your networked computer. I work the &quot;peter principle..if something can go wrong...it will.&quot;</p><p>For telnet if you want try this link <a href="http://logmett.com/index.php?/products/teraterm.html">http://logmett.com/index.php?/products/teraterm.html</a></p><p>Good luck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johnisaacson</strong> on 24 Nov 2013, 07:13)</p>
