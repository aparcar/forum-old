					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m trying do do some modifications against my u-boot bootloader on one of my WR1043NDs. The problem so far is that I cannot JTAG this device ( I can read but I can&#039;t write to the flash) and I need to be pretty sure that the new bootloader works before flashing as de- and resoldering the flash chip takes a lot of time and is not very funny.</p><p>So I compiled their (TP-Link&#039;s) toolchain and tried to compile u-boot configured the same as the one installed on my routers. Then I did a hexdump and compared both against each other. I know there are always some diffs but my problem seems to be that every one of my devices contains a very old bootloader (dated: Nov 17 2009), but some files inside my u-boot package provided by TP-LINK are dated Dec 7 2009 , for example cmd_bootm.c. There are so many differences inside that part that I can&#039;t compare that with my binary installed in the routers.</p><p>So if anyone of you managed to get an update with bootloader or has a router with bootloader which is older than Dec 7 2009 it would be very appreciated if you could send that file to me.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>How to check u-boot version on router:

dd if=/dev/mtd0 | strings | grep -i U-Boot

There should be a line like: U-Boot 1.1.4 (Nov 17 2009 - 11:56:26).

If your one is newer as (Dec 7 2009) please do:

dd if=/dev/mtd0 of=/tmp/mtd0.bin

and send me a copy of the resulting file /tmp/mtd0.bin</code></pre></div><p>This would be very helpful for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
