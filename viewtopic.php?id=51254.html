					<p>I bought a few EnGenius ESR900 dual-band routers on Newegg a few weeks ago when they were on sale for $40 each with the intention of putting OpenWRT on each of them and using them as wireless access points. There wasn&#039;t an official version of OpenWRT compiled for this router so I decided to make my own!</p><p>I&#039;ve only recently submitted the patches to the OpenWRT development mailing list, so it will probably take a while for official support for this router to be added. Until then, I can providing unofficial support through this forum thread and on IRC. In general, you should post questions and ESR900-specific bug reports to this thread so that others can see them and so that I won&#039;t get asked the same thing 100 times on IRC.</p><p>I&#039;ve posted links to compiled firmware images that you can use to flash your router from the factory web interface (those are the *.dlf files) and sysupgrade images (*.bin) that you can flash directly to the device.</p><p>Here&#039;s a list of things that don&#039;t work (yet):<br /></p><ul><li><p>The wireless interfaces appear as &quot;Generic MAC80211&quot; instead or their actual device names (QCA9558 + AR9580)</p></li><li><p>I&#039;m still not 100% sure what the switch config should be</p></li></ul><p>If any of you have any tips for fixing the know issues in the firmware (or even unknown issues), don&#039;t hesitate to post them here! If you want to find out more about this router, I&#039;ve created an ESR900 page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/engenius/esr900">on the wiki</a>.</p><p>P.S.: If you want a port made for one of the other routers in the ESR series, I&#039;m accepting hardware donations. Please contact me if you&#039;re interested.</p><p>-------------------------------------------</p><p>Firmware Image Links:<br /></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#F!vhpnAb5A!mixCJRwWkPlxjeo0GnMHxQ">Mega</a> (preferred)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2KCjNYzqlaraHdfZ2dfMGRqWW8#list">Google Drive</a> (if the Mega link doesn&#039;t work for you)</p></li></ul><p>File Hashes:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sha256sum ESR900-20140823T165235Z.*

The main components of the header are the Vendor ID, Product ID, MD5 hash of the (unobfuscated) combined image, and the 32-bit magic (default: 0x12345678) that is used to derive the 8-byte key that is used to obfuscate the image. Thera are some other values, but many of them are either constants (like the 16-byte &quot;version&quot; string) or unused (like the header checksum).</p>									</div>

					<p>cyrozap,</p><p>I am trying to get openwrt on an engenius EAP600 and have been unable to load any third party firmware on it. I know that the chipset and hardware are supported. Do you think that if I took a working recent image and used your conversion program on it that it would produce a .dlf file that would be loaded by the engenius eap600 firmware itself. Thanks in advance for your thoughts on this topic.</p>									</div>
