					<p>Hi, </p><p>I was trying to enable both sta and adhoc mode with one atheros(ath9k) radio through virtual interfaces but failed. </p><p>Instead, I was able to enable it work on both adhoc and ap mode. I also got to know someone was able to have sta and ap mode work at same time. </p><p>Anyone knows if the ath driver or hw supports working on sta and adhoc mode simultaneously? And how to do that? </p><p>Thanks!<br />-dlw</p>									</div>
