					<p>Recently I have bought a WL-500W and I am looking for a firmware to use. The primary purpose would be illegaly hacking wifi (mainly 802.11g). The best* firmware today seems to be the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wl500g/">Oleg&#039;s</a> and OpenWRT. I would like to ignite a discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of these two. OpenWRT seems superiour (fast development, large user base, forums, lot of doc), but why is then the Oleg&#039;s version still mantained? </p><p><a href="http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php?139993-Hacking-wifi-routers">This</a> is what I have found on this topic in recent year. </p><br /><p>*Note that I have also found others, namely Tomato 1.28 06/07/2010(lacking USB support and outdated) and TomatoUSB Build 54 11/30/2010 (which is outdated).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Slazer</strong> on 7 Jul 2012, 00:49)</p>
