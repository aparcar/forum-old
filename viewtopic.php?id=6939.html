					<p>I&#039;m now on my third installation of openwrt RC5, in my second install I had a lot of problems geting port forwarding to work the way I wanted it to work.&nbsp; There is some info, but not alot since port forwarding should be simple, and it is when it works.&nbsp; Thus I&#039;ve decided to sum all that up here, if it is helpful enough, then maybe this post should then be rolled into a wiki?</p><p>Ontop of the basic install, I&#039;ve installed the following since it was recomended in a wiki and other posts (ipkg install xxxxxxxxx).&nbsp; Do all of these really need to be installed for port forwarding?</p><p>iptables-mod-nat<br />iptables-extra<br />iptables-utils</p><p>Then I have used the web interface to configure port forwarding rules, no need to use iptable commands or edit /etc/firewall.user.&nbsp; The web interface is found by clicking &quot;Network&quot; then &quot;Firewall&quot; when one types the ip address of one&#039;s router into a browser.</p><p>Match&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Target&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accept&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.249&nbsp; &nbsp; 25<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 4662&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.249&nbsp; &nbsp; 4662<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 4672&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.249&nbsp; &nbsp; 4672<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 24430&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.249&nbsp; &nbsp; 24430<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 25500&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.249&nbsp; &nbsp; 22<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 25501&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.249&nbsp; &nbsp; 3389<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 25400&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.155&nbsp; &nbsp; 22<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Destination Ports: 25401&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.155&nbsp; &nbsp; 3389</p><br /><p>One creates an entry like the above by selecting &quot;Forward&quot; after &quot;New Rule&quot; and clicking &quot;Add&quot;.&nbsp; Then select &quot;Destination Port&quot; and Click &quot;Add&quot;.&nbsp; Then type in your &quot;Destination Port&quot;, &quot;Forward To&quot; ip address, and &quot;Port&quot; on that same ip address.&nbsp; Then click &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Apply Changes&quot; at the bottom of the page.</p><p>Note that I&#039;ve set up port translation so I can have multiple ssh servers (port 22) behind the router but I can access each one individualy by the assigned port on the router (25500 or 25400).</p><p>Not that one should shy from iptables, it can be very powerful, for example see <a href="http://www.macsat.com/macsat/content/view/13/30/#sshbrute">http://www.macsat.com/macsat/content/vi â€¦ /#sshbrute</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Does anyone know why port forwarding isn&#039;t available in my webif? I&#039;ve just updated everything (whiterussian rc6) and there is no firewall option when i click on network. I wasn&#039;t even aware this feature was implemented yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>Removed by the OpenWrt devs because it is not perfect in their mind, I guess.</p><p>Anyway, it is still in webif^2. So, go install the webif^2 package from X-Wrt or use /etc/firewall.user.</p>									</div>
