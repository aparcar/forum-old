					<p>Hello everybody!</p><p>The WRT54GL has two internal serial ports and there are UMTS/GPRS modems available with a serial interface. Now I had the idea to put one of these in my WRT54GL to have a backup internet connection in case the main connection does not work. The serial ports of the WRT54GL do not seem to support hardware flow control, but the UMTS/GPRS modems I have seen, do. I do not know if the modems require that or support both hardware and software flow control, though.</p><p>Did anyone try this before? Any ideas or comments about it?</p>									</div>

					<p>try to get the data sheet of the device, or try to find what ic is responsible to controller the data in and data out.<br />If the device only need the tx and rx there a possibility. <br />some device use usb to serial ttl conversions so is you have a old UMTS/GPRS modem device you may have lucky.</p>									</div>
