I uploaded the firmware and the browser kept loading, I waited for ten minutes and then I took off the power and I wasn&#039;t able to get in 192.168.0.1 Next I went to this page again and flashed the stock 3.01 and it worked. However I couldn&#039;t flash 3.10 in this page or the stock interface. I don&#039;t know why ...&nbsp; (BTW, you are using a Chinese interface? My system is in Chinese too and I wonder will it be a problem?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zxcv361</strong> on 16 May 2015, 10:47)</p>
