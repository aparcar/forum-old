					<p>I&#039;ve just set up a new internal DNS/DHCP server on my network and disabled DHCP on OpenWrt (Chaos Calmer). New DHCP server is supplying the correct IPv4 DNS server address, but in ipconfig I&#039;m seeing two DNS server addresses, the first being an IPv6 address that matches what OpenWrt says is the IPv6 address of the LAN interface. Queries for internal hosts are not resolving because they&#039;re going to the IPv6 server address. How did the IPv6 server address get there, and how can I get rid of it?</p><p>I have tried setting Router Advertisement-Service, DHCPv6-Service, and NDP-Proxy all to disabled on the IPv6 settings tab of the DHCP section of the interface settings, though, admittedly, I don&#039;t know what they mean.</p>									</div>
