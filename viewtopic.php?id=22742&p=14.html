					<p>@sala Thanks for both the review and pointing me to it. I&#039;m still worried that I might have screwed <em>something</em> up and ended up with a non-functional or bricking binary. Since I don&#039;t have a serial cable, I couldn&#039;t reflash the router. That&#039;s why I asked for a guinea pig <em>with</em> a serial cable so they can reflash their unit if it craps out on&#039;em. <br />I can&#039;t really run any of the older binaries released by shibby/obsy because they don&#039;t contain a patch that was put into the trunk 3 days ago and that I&#039;d REALLY want to have on my wr1043nd.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks obsy. I ended up compiling my own today, with X-Wrt and USB2.0 print server support. I haven&#039;t really tested it, but X-WRT fires right up on reboot, so I&#039;ll start playing around with configuration tonight. If anyone wants to download it, here&#039;s the link.. <a href="http://www.filefactory.com/file/b059hdg/n/openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-universal_bin">http://www.filefactory.com/file/b059hdg … versal_bin</a> The only promise I can make is that it shouldn&#039;t brick your router (at least the 1.4 but it should be ok for 1.1)</p>									</div>

					<p>Wright, I definitely need to do keep reading about openwrt/this router.
