					<p>I somehow bricked my Buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H. It happened when I attempted to set HT40 mode on the 5.4GHz radio. The &quot;Save &amp; Apply&quot; was the last meaningful communication with the router I&#039;ve had. I now can&#039;t connect using either radio, (I could reach both ssid&#039;s independently before) or ethernet ports, and that goes for LuCI, ssh, and telnet. LEDs seem to be blinking in a mostly &quot;normal&quot; fashion. Diag light turns off during the boot process, like normal.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried these instructions:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p><p>using the AOSS button and the USB disconnect (aka umount) button for 60 secionds, but I&#039;ve been unable to get the router to claim 192.168.1.1 while my PC is on 192.168.1.2. The LEDs seem to be coming on like normal still, so that makes me think the failsafe mode isn&#039;t being triggered. There are also two switches, &quot;Router&quot; (3 position) and &quot;Move Engine&quot; (2 position). Should I see if these trigger failsafe mode?</p><p>Are there any other tricks at my disposal? I&#039;m hoping I can get back into the device and repair the settings so I don&#039;t have to re-flash via tftp.</p><p>Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated. I&#039;m using trunk r30556. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, fyi, that did it!</p><p>The thing I was missing is you&#039;re supposed to repeatedly press the button, not hold it down. In my case, it&#039;s the AOSS button.</p><p>-&gt; 15 seconds after restart, while pressing AOSS many times, 192.168.1.1 became available.<br />-&gt; I stopped pressing the button and telnetted to 192.168.1.1 (from 192.168.1.2), no password, and I&#039;m in.<br />-&gt; I mounted squashfs using mount_root.<br />-&gt; Edited config file with vi /etc/config/wireless. I changed the radio1 option &#039;htmode&#039; from &#039;ht40-&#039; to &#039;ht20&#039;, and for good measure I make sure the options for radio1 are in the same order as for radio0, just in case that is related.<br />-&gt; Power cycled.</p><p>Now, router is back in action. Yay!</p><p>So, different question now: does this mean I shouldn&#039;t try 40MHz mode on my AG300H?</p>									</div>

					<p>FWIW, this issue is repeatable for me.</p><p>First, to cover my butt during this test, I copied the wireless config file to /root/ and added <br />&quot;cp /root/wireless /etc/config/wireless&quot;<br />as the first executed line in my /etc/rc.local</p><p>Then, starting with both radios on, and radio1 (5GHz) set to 17dBm (LuCI reports actual 13dBm), channel 44 (5.22GHz)</p><p>mode 11an, HT20 -&gt; works fine<br />mode 11an, HT40- (second channel below) -&gt; causes unresponsive unit, requiring failsafe recovery<br />mode 11an, HT40+ (second channel above) -&gt; works fine, 130Mbps woohoo</p><p>So, is there something I don&#039;t know which makes it reasonable that setting HT40- on this radio causes networking to not start on the unit, or is this a bug?

					<p>Yes its a bug. Hostapd refuses to go into background when certain failure conditions occur, e.g. HT40+/- on an impossible channel.<br />That was patched a while ago and might have reoccured.</p>									</div>

					<p>After further testing, it appears to be specifically related to the HT40- mode, and for both the 5GHz and 2.4GHz radios. I&#039;ve tried several channels, and every time I choose HT40- (&quot;second channel below&quot;), including 2.4GHz channels 3, 7, and 8, I get an unresponsive system. All of the HT40+ (&quot;second channel above&quot;) attempts have worked fine. So I would guess this is more related to HT40- than &quot;an impossible channel&quot;.</p><p>Or, am I missing something?</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, first, 2 corrections:</p><p>In certain circumstances, like setting HT40- on 2.4GHz channel 8, the router would just disable the radio for some reason. This made me *think* the router was becoming unresponsive like in the other cases, but it fact it wasn&#039;t. I connected at 5GHz, re-enabled the 2.4GHz radio, and was good to go, using, e.g., ch8 HT40-.</p><p>Also, I&#039;ve realized (from info in fyi&#039;s first link) that channels such as 2 or 3 in 2.4GHz actually don&#039;t allow HT40- mode, since that would transmit at frequencies outside the allowed band.</p><p>But I still don&#039;t understand why 5GHz channel 44 in HT40- mode hangs the system. Near as I can tell, this is a legal mode. Am I missing something?</p><p>(Also, sorry for the forum post spam.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Channel 44 HT40- actually does seem illegal. 36 and 40 can be bonded, as can 44 and 48, but not 40 and 44. I don&#039;t know why, though.</p>									</div>
