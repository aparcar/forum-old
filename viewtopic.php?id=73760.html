					<p>Hi,</p><p>Iâ€™m looking for advice on how to resolve a USB tethering issue.</p><p>Router: GL-I MT300N-V2 with openwrt-ramips-mt76x8-gl-mt300n-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin image. USB-RNDIS drivers installed.</p><p>USB tethering setup is confirmed as working with a (borrowed) Huawei P8 lite, this is how it used to work with my old phone, a Huawei P9. The P9 broke and I bought a Nokia 8 as a replacement.</p><p>USB Tethering on Nokia 8 connected directly to a Windows laptop works without any issues, Win8.1 / Win10 create a RNDIS interface and internet is available without any manual configuration. </p><p>IFCONFIG shows the USB0 interface when I connect the Huawei phone, USB0 is not listed with the Nokia 8 phone.</p><p>Nokia 8 is running Android 8.1, Huawei P8 lite and P9 use Android 7.1. <br />Snippet from dmesg: usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci-platform</p><br /><p>Is there something else I need to install/configure for USB tethering with Android 8.1 phone?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>If that&#039;s the only message you see, it means that the USB core enumerated the phone, but the CDC / RNDIS driver did not recognize that it should attach to it.&nbsp; You must of course have USB tethering turned on in the phone&#039;s settings.</p><p>Some drivers have an internal list of manufacuter:device USB ID&#039;s but I don&#039;t know if RNDIS is like that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 8 Apr 2018, 15:45)</p>
