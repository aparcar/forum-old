					<p>Hi:</p><p>I see that there are some built packages for protobufs 2.6. </p><p>I was hoping to build a 3.0 package including gRPC.&nbsp; </p><p>I was hoping to have a look at a 2.6 OpenWRT project that the package was created from so I can adjust to our platform and 3.0. </p><p>Alternatively just some guidance on tweaks of the Google source make system to create the package would be super cool.</p><p>Thanks<br />Howard.</p>									</div>
