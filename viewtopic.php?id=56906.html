					<p>In both BB14.07 and in CC trunk you need to install a special variant of dnsmasq, either &quot;dnsmasq-dhcpv6&quot; or &quot;dhcpv6-full&quot;, as the basic dnsmasq package has been stripped of the dhcpv6 functionality due to size optimization.

					<p>Thanks a lot, both of you guys. I will try this out and report back.</p><p>hnyman: where can I find differences between dnsmasq-dhcpv6 &amp; dnsmasq-full?</p><p>kevindb: I first used odhcpd as the only DHCP server and it would not serve IPv4. As I have to use dnsmasq anyway, why not use a single package? Also DNSMasq does have a lot of documentation (albeit scattered around), while odhcpd sorely lacks documentation. How does one run hook scripts when interfaces get leases etc.? Also, if dnsmasq does provide what is needed and is pretty well used and a stable piece of software, I have not seen the need of a new package to do part of the stuff.</p><p>Another question: what is the state of CC? Where can I find build for my router?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks all. I was able to get this working.

					<p>IPv6 in desperate efforts to make things simple has the most confusing set of address advertising/allocation options I&#039;ve ever come across.&nbsp; And the dnsmasq man page isn&#039;t the most readable but then it is a very powerful piece of software!</p><p>I&#039;ve found &#039;ra-names&#039; works for me in that hosts that understand dhcpv6 will get address via that, whilst those that don&#039;t fall back to SLAAC in response to the router advertisments that go out on the wire.&nbsp; Certainly my &#039;i&#039; devices from the fruit emporium collect SLAAC ipv6 addresses rather than DHCPv6:&nbsp; I want devices to try dhcpv6 first if they&#039;re capable and so far it seems to behave as I want....willing to be corrected though :-)</p><p>Re: dhcp-host option - I&#039;ve not yet tackled trying to do fixed addresses for hosts (or DUIDs) so I&#039;d be interested in your success or otherwise.&nbsp; What I would suggest is using &#039;log-dhcp&#039; to see what dhcp requests are being made, and what replies, complete with all the dnsmasq internal tagging that goes on.</p><p>I can see dhcpv6 DUID based fixed addressing being tomorrow&#039;s experiment :-)</p>									</div>
