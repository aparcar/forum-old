					<p>Hi everybody,<br />I want to hack into my TP-LINK modem, just to get some practice before hacking into some other modems I have at home.<br />What I want to do is dump the contents of its flash memory, modify it, and then put the modified contents into the flash.</p><p>After a lot of research on the web, I found the best way to do this is to find a serial port on the PCB, solder wires to the port, and connect those wires to some db-25 or db-9 connector.<br />Then connect the cable to the pc and boot the modem; This should make me able to access the bootloader ( CFE on broadcom based systems ) menu or something like that...<br />But I have no idea of HOW to find the actual serial port on the PCB... How it&#039;s done ? And after that, how am I supposed to know which pins is what on the PCB ? Which is TX, RX, GND, 3.3v ?</p><p>I also thought about some JTAG action, but I only have 3 connections on the PCB labeled TPx : TP1, TP3V1 TP3V2.<br />Here&#039;s a picture of the PCB of the modem :</p><p><a href="http://postimage.org/image/68f32nsd3/">http://postimage.org/image/68f32nsd3/</a></p><p>Below the left of the big yellow thing at the top, the are 4 pins labeled J2... do you think that&#039;s the Serial Port ? And if it is, how can I know which is which ?<br />I&#039;d really appreciate some help on the matter, and maybe some insight on how you guys find this stuff, so I can do it myself next time.</p><p>I found this :<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8960n?s">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8960n?s</a>[]=tp&amp;s[]=link&amp;s[]=td</p><p>Useful, I&#039;m almost sure what I thought was the serial is the serial, but I still don&#039;t know how to properly connect it to my computer and be able to see the boot process and/or take control of the CPE.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ectod</strong> on 16 Aug 2012, 20:31)</p>
