If you think it is an indication of the maturity of the porting effort for the C7, then its probably good to understand that at least some of the recent reports of trouble flashing the C7 are probably due to TP-Link&#039;s attempt to lock down the router as a hamfisted way of complying with proposed FCC standards.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Just cause the specs on the archer are better doesn&#039;t necessarily mean openwrt will deliver better performance on it.</p></blockquote></div><p>Other than misunderstanding the significance of the specifications, why might actual performance lag behind specified performance? Two explanations are: inferior implementation of hardware, inferior implementation of software.</p><p>Let&#039;s start with the specs first though:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Both routers use Qualcomm Atheros SoCs and WiFi chips.</p></li><li><p>The SoC in both routers is based on the MIPS 74Kc CPU core.</p></li><li><p>The core in the Archer C7&#039;s SoC is clocked at 720MHz, vs 560MHz for the wdr4300.</p></li><li><p>I will assume that both have similar RAM and IO buses, but, if anything, the C7&#039;s are somewhat faster.</p></li><li><p>The Archer C7 3x3 radio chains for both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands, the wdr4300 has a 2x2 chain for 2.4GHz.</p></li><li><p>C7 is 802.11ac in the 5GHz band, vs 802.11n for the wdr4300.</p></li></ul><p>In general I would guess that: <br /></p><ul><li><p>that different Qualcomm Atheros chipsets have similar quality.</p></li><li><p>The C7&#039;s CPU will be faster.</p></li><li><p>The faster CPU will result in higher peak and average performance on the internet connection, because OpenWRT doesn&#039;t make use of the hardware acceleration for NAT/routing/firewall.</p></li><li><p>The C7 will offer better performance over both wireless bands.</p></li><li><p>The C7 will support higher speeds with any 802.11ac devices on 5GHz and 3-stream 802.11n on 2.4GHz.</p></li><li><p>It should also be capable of delivering higher speeds with 802.11n devices on 5Ghz because supporting 802.11ac requires better, more sensitive, more linear RF design on and off the Wi-Fi chip.</p></li><li><p>It may deliver better performance with 1 and 2 stream devices on 2.4GHz due to the additional antenna to choose from.</p></li></ul><p>Moving on to the quality of the hardware design: I would guess that the C7&#039;s quality is likely equal or better to that of the wdr4500. It clearly isn&#039;t bad, because it achieves good performance with the stock firmware under controlled testing. If it was developed by the same team, it was probably developed more recently and with the benefit of learning from earlier designs.</p><p>As for quality of the software. First, most of the code is shared, down to the network drivers. Second, the C7 has received a lot of attention. It was one of the first 802.11ac devices supported by OpenWRT and, because of the value represented by its price and abilities, it has attracted a lot of users/developers. </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>What do you all recommend I buy? Even though the specs on the wdr4300 are lower, does it give a better openwrt experience?</p></blockquote></div><p>I have a C7. I am happy with it. I have taken to having it reboot every day in the mornings, because I it seemed to get erratic after being up for ~3+ days (running 15.05). This compares to solid uptimes of months on the WNDR3800 with OpenWRT I was using previously. But, earlier in its lifecycle, I used to proactively reboot the 3800 every day. Ideally, the C7 will be solid for months on end without daily reboots, but it isn&#039;t. With daily reboots, everything works quite well. The difference between the actual and the ideal is basically unnoticeable.</p><p>I have no hands on experience with the wdr4300.</p><p>I would recommend the C7 though, provided that there is a viable workaround for the attempt to lock out 3rd party firmwares. The OpenWRT port is solid enough, performance is good, and the more capable hardware should deliver benefits now, for any 802.11ac devices you add in the future, and any upgrades to your internet service.</p><p>Actually though, its worth knowing specs on your current internet connection now, and anticipated changes in the future. Both devices are going to be CPU constrained above a certain speed if you try to take advantage of the excellent traffic management capabilities offered by the sqm subsystem on OpenWRT. I&#039;m not sure quite that limit is, but from looking at CPU utilization on my C7 while doing multi-flow speedtests, I&#039;d guess that its probably ~90Mbps aggregate throughput. If you have an asymmetric connection that approaches or exceeds 100Mbps on the downlink, then you can still get most of the traffic management benefit by confining it to your uplink, which will free CPU resources.</p>									</div>

Can you provide any more details on what exactly you mean when you say the device gets &quot;erratic.&quot;</p><p>I hear you on the specs discussion. But your quote above is what I&#039;m worried about. I neglected to mention in my original post that I have been running a WDR4300 for a few years now. And it has been stellar. I never need to restart it. For example, since I installed 15.5 last year, I haven&#039;t touched it; I haven&#039;t needed to. (I need a second router, so I&#039;m trying to decide between another WDR4300 or C7).</p><p>I don&#039;t understand why the C7 would have problems when the WDR4300 would not, but that&#039;s why I asked so people smarter than me or those with direct experience could share their insights.</p><p>Considering how reliable the WDR4300 has been for me, this is what led to my trepidation over moving to anything else. Although, for the future, it does seem the wise move to move to an AC capable router; hence, my dilemma.</p>									</div>
