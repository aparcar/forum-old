					<p>Here are my notes from my serial project for the WRT54g.</p><p>This isn&#039;t pretty or necessarily well designed.&nbsp; You can find plans for those elsewhere.<br /> It&#039;s my quick and dirty, hurry up and get it done already using stuff lying around method:<br />&nbsp; <br />I installed a pin header for the serial port using the pins below.<br />The missing pins make good polarity (I had to leave out pin 10 also as<br />the IDC connector was already filled for that hole).</p><p>I read in others experience to stick something in the hole<br />of the idc connector for pins 7&amp;8&nbsp; to make sure it doesn&#039;t get<br />put in backwards.&nbsp; Excellent idea.</p><p>My WRT54G v2.2 serial port pinout:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  2 4 6 8 10

					<p>At the risk of repetition, but with the advange of adding this in a relevant place, as well as the searchable forum, I quote from the <a href="http://openwrt.org/MiniHowtos">http://openwrt.org/MiniHowtos</a> </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>2.1. Spawn a shell on serial console<br />By default, no shell is initiated on the serial console line. Remember that stock out-of-the-box OpenWRT points /etc/inittab to /rom/etc/inittab, which means you should follow the&nbsp; FAQ question coverting how to do this. <br />Add the following to /etc/inittab. Make sure this line comes IMMEDIATELY after the ::shutdown: entry, and before any other services (dnsmasq, etc...)!: <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>::respawn:/bin/ash 0&lt;/dev/console 1&gt;/dev/console 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre></div><p>Then send a HUP signal to init (kill -HUP 1). You should now have a working shell via serial console. <br />If you may receive the message: ash: can&#039;t access tty; job control turned off, then /bin/ash isn&#039;t the first application spawned by init; the first application gets control of the tty. If dnsmasq or other toys come first, they will have control of the tty, hence the lack-of job control.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>Just a piece of information on /dev/tts/1.</p><p>This second serial port is kinda slow not just because of the default rate of 9600 bps but because there&#039;s no IRQ assigned to it, causing the device driver to do polling.</p><p>You can fix it by using <a href="http://setserial.sourceforge.net/">setserial</a>.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>setserial /dev/tts/1 irq 3</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>CRC,</p><p>The way you hook up the RS232 pins depends if you want to configure it as DTE or DCE equipment.&nbsp; PC&#039;s are DTE, and since the Linksys is (to me) a small PC, I wired it as DTE.&nbsp; To use it with a PC,&nbsp; you would need a null modem cable, which switches those rx and tx lines around.</p><p>If you want it to be DCE&nbsp; (I.e. like a modem or something that hooks directly to the PC), then you are correct to switch the pins (and use no null modem cable).</p><p>I am very happy to hear that someone else has tried and had success with this method.</p><p>-Robert</p>									</div>
