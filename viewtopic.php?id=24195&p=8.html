					<p>Original DGN3500 firmware is using <strong>dsl_cpe_control</strong> binary file v4.8 which is much newer than used in OpenWRT one ().

I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t help with your request but, are you sure the instability depends totally on your DGN3500? If I were you I would try with another modem and see what happen.<br />Recently I had to call the ISP technicians for some instability, and they also told me could be my fault but it turned out to be a remote modem fault.</p>									</div>
