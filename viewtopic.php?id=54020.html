					<p>i&#039;m going to guess - probably not so open and probably a proprietary driver. this is probably straight from the Qualcomm SDK. The NBG6716 is similar in this regard, *I think*. It was AA based though, although I wonder if the latest update is also BB. The hardware is quite similar with the same OEM according to wikidevi.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />One more with the same problem. By chance I found a forked older version (February 2016)&nbsp; which does seem to work at:<br /><a href="https://repo.bologna.ninux.org/BleedingEdge_DesignatedDriver_20160208_01_lime_full/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-NBG6616-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://repo.bologna.ninux.org/Bleeding … pgrade.bin</a></p><p>So something must have broken since then. Notice the size is about 5 MB whereas the current at both openwrt and lede-project is about 3.5 MB.</p><p>Since it is a fork of some kind I assume it doesn&#039;t just do the standard openwrt stuff, so I reverted back to the ZyXEL firmware using the recovery procedure.</p><p>I believe (but not entirely sure) that it has been broken since at least July 11, 2016.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. I followed the instructions on the wiki on how to install OpenWRT on the NBG6616 and I bricked it. I tried the recovery procedure for 4 days now, with different TFTP servers and configurations, and nothing worked. The router is sending exactly 0 packets to my PC when connected with the IP 192.168.1.33 / netmask 255.255.255.0 . (btw, I left the Default Gateway blank, is that correct?) I my main OS is Windows 10 (AU) and had no succes from it. I also tried from a live session of Ubuntu 16.xx , no succes. I cannot get the recovery via TFTP to work, can somebody better explain the steps taken, with a little bit more detail? Thank you!</p>									</div>

I my main OS is Windows 10 (AU) and had no succes from it. I also tried from a live session of Ubuntu 16.xx , no succes. I cannot get the recovery via TFTP to work, can somebody better explain the steps taken, with a little bit more detail? Thank you!</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi also had problems using tftp on windows 10. I finally managed by Mac OS X on my Macbook Pro:</p><p>Download PumpKIN (tftp client for Mac OS X).

I didn&#039;t try flashing the NBG6616 since I bricked it a few times with the last OpenWRT Trunk builds. Then I would give the LEDE build a try (since the OpenWRT trunk still seems to be broken if I read Wooph&#039;s post above).</p>									</div>
