					<p>I have a WD-02 router (Same hardware as the HooToo TM-02 router) that I installed OpenWRT on long ago.</p><p>I have several issues with the current firmware. Specifically, I want to set up Samba and a Web File Manager on the router with read-only permissions on both, but with an option to log in to upload files. The intention was to use it as a NAS.</p><p>Sadly, I suck at finding answers on Google, apparently. I have looked high and low, and can&#039;t figure out how this sort of thing works at all. I have some idea of some of it, but only from poking at it and making &quot;Oook?&quot; noises.</p><p>There&#039;s also the won&#039;tfix bug that shuts off the WiFi radio hardware if it can&#039;t connect to a host AP in client mode (It has a client connection to get Internet, and an AP that provides the same Internet (bridge) AND file access. If it worked the way I wanted. I have a script to fix it, but it relies on pinging 8.8.8.8 rather than checking to see if the client connection is down or not (there has to be a way to do that, right? The router knows it&#039;s down, otherwise I would have it broadcasting its own AP!). There&#039;s an old script for that, but it is either broken or I have a special case. I assure you, I do know for a fact that it&#039;s not working, and it isn&#039;t because I am doing it wrong. I&#039;ve managed to focus my tiny brain on figuring that out, at least. While I can add it into the firmware image, I don&#039;t know what to add as well so that I can trigger the script by any means other than SSH and a keyboard. That rather negates the purpose of fixing the WiFi when I can&#039;t connect in the first place.</p><p>So, I managed to keep the files that the OpenWRT installer left behind, and ALL.bin sounds promising.<br />I&#039;ll keep the mysterious and slightly crippled Manufacturer OS, since it at least works -- mostly.<br />It did all that I wanted, but I could not access Samba or the WFM from the external wifi network it subscribes to. At this point, I don&#039;t care. (The previous version had external access, but the file upload window used Flash. That didn&#039;t work too well with my Linux PCs. It&#039;s not like they warn you that they are about to break a little-known feature you relied upon...)</p><br /><br /><p>Here&#039;s the problem:<br />The image contains the U-Boot loader as well as the rest of the OS. (I&#039;ll also note that it&#039;s 8.4 MB, and I thought the router had only 8MB of flash...)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>binwalk Router\ Debugging/SDCARD/ALL.bin

					<p>I am not sure how much it will hep you. but i have restored the company firmware using TFTP. I used following steps</p><p>1. get original firmware <br />2. rename the firmaware file name as the router will look for.&nbsp; for tp-link WR841ND. the file which router looks for is wr841nv11_tp_recovery.bin.&nbsp; You can google for it</p><p>you can search this video on </p><p>TP Link - Reinstall / Restore to OEM factory stock firmware from OpenWRT or DD-WRT Firmware</p><br /><p>Also pls note that you may have to repeat the step of &quot;Holding reset button and powering on to upload firmware&quot;&nbsp; many times</p>									</div>

					<p>Quick question: The installer for this router overwrote the stock Uboot. Does this work with the new one that was added, or does it assume original bootloader? It&#039;s supposed to be one commonly used with OpenWRT now.</p>									</div>
