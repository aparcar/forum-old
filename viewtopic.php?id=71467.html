					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWRT on a TP-Link 300 Mbps Wireless N Cable Router, Easy Setup, WPS Button, UK Plug (TL-WR841N)</p><p>If you don&#039;t know it you can type that above into amazon and it&#039;s top link, can&#039;t share link not allowed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I don&#039;t have any malicious users, it&#039;s just family members, my issue is however say for example if we have a PS4 downloading updates wireless or any large download then it slows down the internet to a standstill. I was wondering if there is a way for limiting the bandwidth / priority of large tasks.</p><p>I don&#039;t really want to use bandwidth control because if there is no other device actively doing something, although it may be connected, it should be then given full access and I was under the impression bandwidth control only works all the time. If not then please enlighten me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I was thinking about QoS but IDK. This wasn&#039;t an issue with the old router, so trying to work out how they did it so I could do it.</p><p>Cheers Guys,</p><p>Thomas!</p>									</div>
