					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a central openwrt router on which I configured a LAN network, a DMZ and<br />a DHCP server. The DHCP server serves clients from both networks with different<br />IP ranges.</p><p>To this router I have connected a few wireless access points (also running<br />openwrt) where I want to configure two different wifi networks:</p><p>1st network: Clients connecting to this network should receive an IP<br />address from the LAN address range and have full access to LAN, DMZ and<br />Internet.</p><p>2nd network: Clients connecting to this network should receive either an<br />IP address from a complete new address range, or one of the DMZ range.<br />But the address should also be given from the central DHCP server.<br />Clients should not have access to the LAN zone.</p><p>The first network is not a problem. I also have no problem with the<br />firewall settings.&nbsp; My Problem is that I don&#039;t know how to setup the<br />second network and the central DHCP server. Somehow the DHCP server has<br />to know to which wifi a client is connected to.</p><p>Is this even possible without activating DHCP servers on each access<br />point? I like the idea of only one central server where I can configure<br />my static leases and see all the IPs used. </p><p>Can I set this up using VLAN tags? Or am I thinking to complicated and it<br />is a lot easier? Or is it impossible?</p><p>As hardware I am using an APU board as central router/DHCP server. Three<br />TP-Link 1750 Archer C7 boards are used as access points, all installed with the<br />latest version of Chaos Calmer.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Monkey</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>sorry for bringing this up after such a long time but I haven&#039;t found the time<br />earlier and now&#039;m still having trouble with this setup! I try to tell you where<br />my problem is, but at first what I have done so far:</p><p>1st thing is that the central router, the APU board, has 3 physical interfaces.<br />I configured<br />* eth0 as LAN<br />* eth1 as DMZ<br />* eth2 as WAN</p><p>I setup an DHCP-Server on the LAN and the DMZ inteface, I want to keep my LAN<br />untagged, so I won&#039;t need to do anything with VLANs on this network.</p><p>After my &quot;normal&quot; (untagged) LAN-wifi was working, I created an additional<br />VLAN-interface (on my access point), named it &quot;DMZ&quot; and set the interface to<br />eth1.2. I bridged it to my DMZ-wifi.</p><p>This is the network-config on my access-point:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
        option force_link &#039;1&#039;
        option type &#039;bridge&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
        option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;

        option gateway &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;
        option dns &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;

config switch
        option name &#039;switch0&#039;
        option reset &#039;1&#039;
        option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;

        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;
        option ports &#039;0 2 3 4 5&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;2&#039;
        option ports &#039;1 6&#039;

config interface &#039;dmz&#039;
        option ifname &#039;eth1.2&#039;
        option proto &#039;static&#039;
        option ipaddr &#039;10.10.10.2&#039;
        option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
        option _orig_ifname &#039;eth1.2&#039;
        option _orig_bridge &#039;false&#039;
        option type &#039;bridge&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Note: I changed the ifname in the dmz from eth0.2 to eth1.2 since my lan<br />interface is eth1. I found a ticket about this here:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20739">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20739</a></p><p>As available interfaces LuCI shows me (under Network - Interfaces - DMZ -<br />Physical Settings):<br />* Ethernet Adapter: &quot;eth0&quot;<br />* VLAN Interface: &quot;eth0.1&quot;<br />* VLAN Interface: &quot;eth0.2&quot;<br />* Ethernet Switch: &quot;eth1&quot; (lan)<br />* VLAN Interface: &quot;eth1.2&quot; (dmz)<br />* Wireless Network: Master &quot;LAN-SSID&quot; (lan)<br />* Wireless Network: Master &quot;DMZ-SSID&quot; (dmz) </p><p>When I now try to connect to my dmz-wifi I see the dhcp-requests leaving the<br />br-dmz interface using tcpdump, but they don&#039;t appear on my APU-board.</p><p>I also tried bridging it to the Ethernet Switch (so it said lan, dmz) with no<br />result.</p><p>I don&#039;t want to setup an VLAN-ID on the APU board (like eth1.2) since it has<br />three interfaces (by the way, I tried it but it didn&#039;t change anything).</p><p>The central router and the access points are connected over a switch on which I<br />have configured VLAN trunk ports carrying vlan-id 1 and 2. But maybe I made a<br />mistake there...</p><p>I read something about appending a &quot;t&quot; to the ports where I want the VLAN-ID to<br />be added when leaving the interface. Do I need this option somewhere.</p><p>Somehow I&#039;m lost and any help would be highly appreciated! Even if you think<br />the problem might be somewhere else...</p><p>Thanks<br />Monkey</p>									</div>
