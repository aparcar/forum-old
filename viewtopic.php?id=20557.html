					<p>Hi, </p><p>since some weeks I&#039;m facing crashes using kamikaze 8.09 stable compiled from source and trunk versions. This does not happen when using pre built binaries downloaded from openwrt web site.<br />The devices are ar71xx based (RB433 and RB411). The minipci is a atheros 5212 based (R52 from Mikrotik). I noted that the crash happens only after some seconds later I have connected to the wifi network and I started to generate traffic.<br />I tried to send the log to a remote machine but the error is never logged. Using a while loop on dmesg I could capture something which likely is the error or part of it<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mm/memory.c:127: bad pgd 72006c18</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>I got some problems too... don&#039;t know where to put it...</p><p>I was testing throughput over my wireless link: Linux -&gt; LAN -&gt; Kamikaze 8.09 -&gt; Wireless SuperA -&gt; Linux<br />I finished TCP test (netperf from Linux to Linux) then started the UDP test (also in netperf). <br />Then, I lost my Putty connection, no ping reply, no SSID broadcast anymore, nothing.<br />As my Routerboard (RB433AH) is on remote location, I still have not locally been there.<br />I was using the board for over 1 month with no problems.</p><p>The other thing is, AR71xx and IXP4xx boards, 1 wireless link works good, second and third link don&#039;t work. Signal levels 20dBm lower than should be.</p><p>Kamikaze 8.09 2.6.26.5 on AR71xx board, 8.09 2.6.26.5 on IXP4xx board.</p><p>So, if I can help with any other info, will be very glad to do so.</p><p>Regards to all.</p>									</div>

					<p>I opened a ticket. I tried to compile stable version from sources using kernel 2.6.26.5, the same as the one used in the prebuilt images, but the crash still occurs.

					<p>This is quite a bad news because I was about to give new version a try! As a remark I point out that also in the working 8.09 version prebuilt I&#039;m experiencing a warning about packet queueing on ath0 device. This didn&#039;t lead to real problems until now. I got a crash on prebuilt stable using wds between two rb433 with r52 after some hours of usage. The error was related to NETDEV WATCHDOG being timed out. I can&#039;t get any reference to this problems nor in this forum neither googling around.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem of rb433 with just only one minipci wireless device working have already been reported by someone else, I can&#039;t remember where I read it. I also can&#039;t remember which trunk versions were working so far, if I&#039;m not wrong RC1 and RC2 were working with rb433 + SR71 from ubiquiti and ath9k drivers. It would be nice if someone with more deep knownledge of the ar71xx status could clarify this questions.</p>									</div>

Thought it was defective, because a 5212 with b/g only worked like a charm (Im running a Ubiquiti RouterStation).</p><br /><p>But now, since it was brand new, i think it might be related to this bug.</p>									</div>

					<p>I suppose the driver is seeing the card as &quot;up&quot;. So it tries to scan, but gets this error. If I try to &quot;ifconfig ath0 down; sleep 2; ifconfig ath0 up&quot; it doesn&#039;t help.

The link is working as we speak (5.5 MB/s, not as it should and it should be 7 MB/s).<br />Also I put ath2 in &quot;STA&quot; mode, but it&#039;s not connected. In scan I cant find anything (beside the 2 ath cards in the same RB in AP mode @ -38dBm and -40dBm, which is OK, I think).</p><p>If it dosn&#039;t crash in 2 days, seems something is wrong with the STA mode.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a very similar problem.i am running the Ubiquiti Routerstation and&nbsp; one SR71-A radio.
