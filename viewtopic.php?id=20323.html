					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a Asus WL-500gp router with Kamikaze 8.09 and Kernel 2.6. After I installed some additional packages with opkg and maybe did some wrong configuration of WAN and LAN interface I cannot connect to the router anymore. When I switch it on, the Power LED is on and the LAN Port LED on which my pc is connected via a cable is flashing. But there is now chance to ping it, access to it via Webfrontend, etc.. DHCP also does not work. If I try pushing the reset button and switch the device on, the power LED flashs slowly, but the device is not pingable and the Asus Restauration tool also does not work. After I choose the firmware it searchs for a valid IP but then nothing happens.&nbsp; Is there any change to reflash the software to the device.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Strater</p>									</div>
