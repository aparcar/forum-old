					<p>So instead of downloading the reghack on first boot and patching the files I&#039;m thinking of either patching them during/before image builder or just including the patched ath.ko and cfg80211.ko in the image.</p><p>Hence the questions:<br />1. The reghack.c determines the platform to be hacked at run-time, right? So I wouldn&#039;t be able to compile and run it on my build platform, right?<br />2. If the reghack.c can be compiled and ran on the build platform -- is there a way to include it into the ImageBuilder process?<br />3. If I end up just including the already patched files in the image, is there some check which can be done on the router to confirm the files have been patched? I should I just simply include the flag-file in the image to indicate patched files are already there?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I&#039;d like to do that too. Jow&#039;s reghack != (just) &quot;respect regdomain set&quot;, you can set higher txpower etc. So I&#039;d like to integrate it during building too. But I don&#039;t mind make menuconfig though, so is there some easy how-to? ;-)</p>									</div>
