					<p>Hi,<br />I have searched the web about this topic, but did not find a working solution for my problem. I set up a openvpn server following the tutorial at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a><br />I did everything exactely from the beginning including &quot;Routing all traffic through the tunnel&quot;. Afterwards I can ping every device on my local network, but was not able to connect to the internet through the VPN tunnel. The intention to set up VPN was for me to have access to all my local devices at home and to have&nbsp; a secure internet connection through my home router. The client configuration looks like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>##############################################
# Sample client-side OpenVPN 2.0 config file #
# for connecting to multi-client server.     #
#                                            #
# This configuration can be used by multiple #
# clients, however each client should have   #
# its own cert and key files.                #
#                                            #
# On Windows, you might want to rename this  #
# file so it has a .ovpn extension           #
##############################################

# Specify that we are a client and that we
# will be pulling certain config file directives
# from the server.

# Use the same setting as you are using on

# On most systems, the VPN will not function
# unless you partially or fully disable
# the firewall for the TUN/TAP interface.
;dev tap

# Windows needs the TAP-Win32 adapter name
# from the Network Connections panel
# if you have more than one.  On XP SP2,
# you may need to disable the firewall
# for the TAP adapter.
;dev-node MyTap

# Are we connecting to a TCP or
# UDP server?  Use the same setting as
# on the server.

# The hostname/IP and port of the server.
# You can have multiple remote entries
# to load balance between the servers.

# Choose a random host from the remote
# list for load-balancing.  Otherwise
# try hosts in the order specified.
;remote-random

# Keep trying indefinitely to resolve the
# host name of the OpenVPN server.  Very useful
# on machines which are not permanently connected
# to the internet such as laptops.

# a specific local port number.

# If you are connecting through an

# that the certicate has the nsCertType
# field set to &quot;server&quot;.  This is an
# important precaution to protect against
# a potential attack discussed here:
#  http://openvpn.net/howto.html#mitm

# To use this feature, you will need to generate
# your server certificates with the nsCertType
# field set to &quot;server&quot;.  The build-key-server
# script in the easy-rsa folder will do this.
;ns-cert-type server

# If a tls-auth key is used on the server

;tls-auth ta.key 1

# Select a cryptographic cipher.
# If the cipher option is used on the server
# then you must also specify it here.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve been playing a lot with OpenVPN lately. I tested many different configurations so I am sure I probably faced a similar issue along the way.<br />Hard to say what is wrong, but I recommend some commands that may help you to narrow it down:<br />Are you connecting to the VPN server from a different Network, or from your LAN?<br />-check if IP address is correct<br />-check routing table<br />-traceroute to check where traffic is stopping</p><p>Windows client? <br />ipconfig<br />route print<br />tracert -d 8.8.8.8</p><p>Linux?<br />ifconfig<br />route -n<br />tracepath -n 8.8.8.8</p><p>You might have to change some IPtables to allow traffic back and forth. <br />Hope this helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>One way to do this is add routes back into your network(s) via an up script. <br />This would allow you to have all traffic sent to the internet at the same time give access to local services.</p><p>Do some searching on how to add routes via the up script when the vpn comes up.</p><p>Be careful in how you do this you don&#039;t want to break your ability to get into the router by doing this. I have not done this but this is the only thing I could think of that would make this work. <br />Most of my configurations are done in a split tunnel and then I add host that I want going through the vpn to the routes.</p>									</div>

					<p>In my case I can access Internet using the IP, it not work with domain name. So I add the DNS (network &gt; interfaces &gt; wan &gt; DNS) to use Google public DNS (8.8.4.4, 8.8.8.8).</p>									</div>
