					<p>Dear All,</p><p>I tried to update the firmware of my Linksys WRT54G but this failed. I could not even ping the router...<br />Thus, I opened the router and shorten PINS 15/16 and managed to make it pingable.<br />Then, I uploaded the openwrt-g-code.bin from snapshot-20050202.tar.bz2 via TFTP. It seemed to work but now, the powerled is flashing and the DMZ led is on. In addition, I cannot access the router web interface.</p><p>Is my router destroyed? What would be your piece of advice to make my router work (even with official firmware :_o| ...)?</p><p>I would really appreciate some help as I am stuck for days on this issue...</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Guillaume.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Guillaume</strong> on 8 May 2005, 23:45)</p>

					<p>humm. Is it the correct forum to ask that kind of question or nobody has a solution to this issue? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
