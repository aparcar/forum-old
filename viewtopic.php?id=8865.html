					<p>I have a server that I want to put in standby when idle, and some closed client devices that don&#039;t know how to wake the server.&nbsp; I want OpenWRT to insert a Wake-on-LAN to the server when the client devices send special messages which indicate they&#039;re searching for a server.&nbsp; (See more full description below if interested.)</p><p>Can someone please tell me if this is possible with OpenWRT and, if so, how I might go about it?</p><p>Many thanks in advance for any guidance you can give me.</p><p>_____________<br />(More detailed description follows.)<br />I have a problem and just found OpenWRT and would like to know if it is capable of solving it. </p><p>I run PVR (personal video recorder) software on Windows and use several Hauppauge MediaMVP&#039;s (little linux boxes with MPEG2 and MP3 decoding) as clients interfacing to televisions. To save electricity and the environment, I would like the PC to go to Standby whenever possible, and have it woken when I power on one of the MediaMVPs. The problem is the MediaMVPs do not issue Wake-On-Lan messages, but they do contact DHCP on my Linksys WRT54G and then issue a special message which looks for the video-server. I know the MAC addresses of the MediaMVPs and the format of the looking-for-server message and that the message is sent from IP port 16882. </p><p>I wondered if I could use DD-WRT to do the following: </p><p>1. Detect the special looking-for-server message coming from the MAC addresses of the MediaMVPs. <br />2. When it sees those messages, go to a script or some automatic process which would: </p><p>2A. Send a Wake-On-Lan message to the video server <br />2B. Wait a short time (say, 3-5 seconds) for the video server to come out of standby <br />2C. Then send the server the looking-for-server message that came from the MediaMVP. </p><p>Is something like this possible? </p><p>If so, could you please give me some guidance on how I would go about it. </p><p>Thank you very much.</p>									</div>

					<p>No detailed response, rather a theoretical answer...</p><p>You could probably configure tcpdump to sniff the network looking for a particular packet, run the output through grep looking for that particular packet in the stream, and if it finds it, send the magic packet to your PC and have the whole thing running in the background.</p><p>Should work, but it&#039;ll also eat up a lot of resources to have tcpdump constantly sniffing the network.</p><p>I&#039;m sure someone else can help you with the script.</p><br /><p>~jeff~</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; &nbsp;I share your concern about finding a process which will maintain throughput.<br />I was assuming/hoping there would be something like a built-in port-forwarding mechanism which would use some existing mechanism of the router.<br />E.g.,&nbsp; If I could forward the message, based on the SENDING port number,&nbsp; to an internal port/process in the router, that process could then inject the Wake-on-LAN message and then send the original (intercepted/forwarded) message.&nbsp; Then the process would only be invoked when the special message is sent on powerup by the MVP client, so the throughput impact would be minimal.&nbsp; &nbsp;In essence, is there any in-built mechanism that would allow detecting and forwarding based upon the source port #?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If so, how would I use it?</p><p>Any response/help/advice will be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, once again my response is brief, but I figure it&#039;s better than nothing...</p><p>Do some research into port knocking and see if that fits what you&#039;re looking for.</p><br /><p>~jeff~</p>									</div>

					<p>Oh, furthermore, in order for this store-and-forward capability you mention to work properly, there would need to be some process monitoring <strong>all</strong> traffic on the network, otherwise it wouldn&#039;t know anything about what saved message to send on to the other device.&nbsp; Unless the WOL packet is all you wanted to send...</p><br /><p>~jeff~</p>									</div>
