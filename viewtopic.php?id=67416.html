					<p>I have followed <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w9980">the installation instructions</a> and have installed OpenWrt on my TD-W9980. OpenWrt itself appears to be working fine.</p><p>My problem, however, is that the router won&#039;t boot unless I connect R225 to GND and re-upload u-boot.asc on every boot.</p><p>Currently, when I turn the router on, the serial console simply displays the &quot;EEPROM Data OK / UART&quot; prompt and never proceeds to launch U-Boot.</p><p>I should mention that, at one point during installation, the wire I used to connect R225 to GND accidentally touched some of the components close to R225, giving off sparks. Hopefully, I didn&#039;t fry anything. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s a good sign that the router does boot in spite of this (but, again, only when re-uploading u-boot.asc on boot).</p><p>I&#039;m thinking it might be worth a shot to reinstall U-Boot. How would I go about doing this?</p><p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>I should add that the router is stuck in CFG 04 mode (which is boot-over-UART mode, <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/bt/homehub_v5a#installing_openwrt_switching_from_original_firmware_to_openwrt">from what I can gather</a>):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ROM VER: 1.1.4
CFG 04
EEPROM Data OK
UART</code></pre></div><p>Looking at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8980#oem_bootlog">the bootlog for the very similar TD-W8980</a>, CFG 05 appears to be the correct boot mode to use after installing OpenWrt.</p><p>So, I assume I need to change the boot mode to CFG 05.</p><p>But how?</p>									</div>
