					<p>I had the same problem. but you can solve it.<br />It&#039;s a problem of network configuration, fonera+ has a switch and need a different configuration.<br />I follewed the suggestions of Lama Bleu (http://www.moliets-bastide.info/).<br />I paste here his method:</p><p>I think the problem is by default OpenWRT is using eth0 and eth1 as<br />LAN ans WAN interfaces. But for fonera+ we need to access eth0.0 and<br />eth0.1 ports.<br />I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s the problem, but I think yes.</p><br /><p>The other solution if you have some free time today, is to boot<br />FONERAM (working in RAM, no reflashing needed) and try to access the<br />JFFS partition, using &quot;mtd-mount&quot; command.<br />Then you can access/edit the /jffs/etc/network file to check if LAN is<br />on eth0 or eth0.0</p><p>If you have few minutes today, go to<br /><a href="http://www.moliets-bastide.info/post/FONERAM">http://www.moliets-bastide.info/post/FONERAM</a><br />Intructions are easy to use ( How to run section), and the you can<br />access the actual &quot;rootfs&quot; partition.</p><p>(I followed the guide on his site and I mounted the jffs partition with mtd-mount but he also suggest this way):</p><p>To mount the JFFS (very long, perhaps 3 minutes):<br />root@LamaBleu:~# mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock1 /jffs</p><p>(when you hat it mounted)</p><p>then perform this command (backup and replace network file):<br />cp /jffs/etc/config/network /jffs/etc/config/network.org<br />cp /etc/config/network /jffs/etc/config/network</p><p>and now the switch will work properly!</p><p>if you also want to active the wifi device you have to edit :</p><p>/jffs/etc/config/wireless</p><p>than reboot and enjoy it!</p>									</div>
