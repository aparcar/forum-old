					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m new and trying to learn a little, so bear with my newness, a please feel free to fill me in on things you see me not figuring out.&nbsp; I got OpenWrt up and running on my Linksys WRT54G, ver 3.0.&nbsp; My intention was to learn about aircrack.&nbsp; When I tried to install it, it asked for other packages aircrack needed.&nbsp; I got them all installed, but by the time all these dependencies were in place, there wasn&#039;t enough memory left for aircrack!</p><p>After deleting the install packages I did get on the unit, df -h shows the following:</p><p>Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Size&nbsp; &nbsp; Used&nbsp; Available&nbsp; &nbsp;Use%&nbsp; Mounted on<br />rootfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.6M&nbsp; &nbsp;1.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp;100%&nbsp; /<br />/dev/root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.6M&nbsp; &nbsp;1.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp;100%&nbsp; /rom<br />tmpfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; 52.0k&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7.0M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1%&nbsp; /tmp<br />/dev/mtdblock/4&nbsp; 1.7M&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.7M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28.0k&nbsp; &nbsp; 98%&nbsp; /jffs<br />mini_fo:/jffs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.6M&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp;100% /</p><p>Is this typical of my particular model of WRT54G (just not enough space), or is there something I&#039;m doing wrong?&nbsp; Am I going to have to figure out how to compile a smaller brand of OpenWrt get everything to fit (I don&#039;t have the slightest idea about how to go about Linux compiling) or is that even an option?&nbsp; I have been using the default kamikaze 8.09.1 release, for Broadcom 2.4 devices.</p><p>THANKS for your help in advance!<br />-Josh</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dewey</strong> on 16 Sep 2009, 05:37)</p>
