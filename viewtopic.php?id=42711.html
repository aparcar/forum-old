					<p>I followed the instructions below to install Privoxy on my router:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/proxy.privoxy">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/proxy.privoxy</a></p><p>The installation and configuration went fine. I only changed the listen address (192.168.1.1:8118), nothing else. </p><p>I can&#039;t log in to the Privoxy web interface using the above IP address. When I try I get the error &quot;Invalid header received from client.&quot;. Also, if I add the proxy settings to my browser I am unable to bring up any web pages (&quot;proxy not found&quot; error). I don&#039;t have any other proxies or anything else for that matter running. </p><p>I verified that Privoxy is running with netstat......and now I&#039;m officially out of ideas. I&#039;m running Backfire final, if that matters at all.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>See, the problem with that, is that you moved to an old version of software. Now, because of whatever reboot problems you had, you&#039;ve now stuck on Backfire. Forever. It would be much better to move to a newer version, perhaps Trunk, to see if your reboot problems stop.</p><p>Privoxy doesn&#039;t run right on Backfire.</p>									</div>

					<p>Stuck how? I could always update (again) to AA. Also, I&#039;m aware that I could try trunk as well, but I admit that resolving complex issues (such as the reboots, poor wireless throughput, etc) are beyond my skillset. It was much less hassle for to just downgrade and be done with it (also, so the GF would stop complaining about the WiFi lol).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sirchuckoftron</strong> on 10 Mar 2013, 18:23)</p>

					<p>It&#039;s a minor bug, disregard it. Privoxy for BF seems to be broken, but only for web access. </p><p>I&#039;ve just wasted like 6 hours, but if you setup 80-&gt;8118 (or whatever your port is) and enable forwarded requests, it works.</p><p>Trying to GET into web access sends privoxy into infinite loop (or recursion), seems like it re-requests 192.168.1.1:8118.<br />If you don&#039;t go to web access and set it up using config, it works.</p>									</div>
