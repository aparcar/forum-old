					<p>I have an Asus WL-500gP with Kamikaze 7.09 installed. I&#039;m trying to get PHP to work but I have no luck.</p><p>I have added the following line to /etc/ipkg.conf, then run &quot;ipkg update&quot;:<br />src backports <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/0.9">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/0.9</a></p><p>After that I installed php by typing &quot;ipkg install php5-cgi&quot; which installed both php5-cgi and php5.</p><p>When I try to just type &quot;/usr/bin/php&quot; and hit enter all i get printed is &quot;Aborted&quot;. What am I doing wrong?</p><p>I have also tried to run php-scripts from lighttpd and I get an 403-error. The logs tell me that cgi did close and I guess that the error is because of php aborting?</p><p>Anyone? Please!</p>									</div>
