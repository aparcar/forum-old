					<p>Just an update, Ok, well my new brightbox arrived (old style) updated cfe and flashed with my custom image all went well cheers, I have ordered screw driver so i can remove the screws off the New upright BB1 as I dont already have one of those.</p><p>In the meantime I did comparisons of the two based on the GUI, Both identical but carry different boot code and runtime versions, there&#039;s another difference which will probably prevent the flashing of the new BB1 via the cfe web interface, the CFE web server requests a password to access it and its not the password for the EE Web interface</p>									</div>

Also I agree that replacing the SoC&#039;s is not a handy job but with proper equipment which I&#039;ve now it can be easy for me.
