					<p>I am trying to compile the bluetooth library tinyb for openwrt using the cross compiling toolchain. The library needs glib2 and so when compiling the build system I first went to the make menuconfig and made sure glib2 was selected under libraries. After the make is finished there are no shared libraries for glib2 under &quot;staging_dir/toolchain/lib&quot; but there is a .ipk package for glib2 under &quot;/bin/ar71xx/packages/packages&quot;. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What am i missing here , I need the shared libraries libgobject, libgio and libglib-2 in the build system so i can cross compile</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried to find the package you&#039;re referring to, but could not find anything even remotely resembling this name in either the core packages or in any of the feeds (I grepped for tinyb and for bluetooth).</p><p>As a result, I can only give you generic help.</p><p>The problem is that the Makefile for the package in question does not have a Build/InstallDev section to copy the libraries to the staging folders.</p><p>You need a section that looks something like the following in the Makefile. You&#039;ll need to edit the Makefile yourself.</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>define Build/InstallDev
