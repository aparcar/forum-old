					<p>Hello everyone! If I post this in the wrong forum section feel free to move it. I have a few routers laying around that I like to tinker with every now and again and one of them is the Linksys WRT1200ac version 1. It seems to work fine stock, but I decided to install the latest version of OpenWRT (Reboot 17.01.2). Everything works great except when I game I see increased latency and high ping times which in turn causes gaming to be all but impossible. I do game on WiFi and while I know that is not ideal the issue seems to be only with the WRT1200ac router + OpenWRT. I know this because as soon as I plug in my TP-Link Archer C7 there are no latency or ping issues in the same game. I have checked to make sure that the settings in OpenWRT are set to the same channels and same frequencies on WiFi as the TP-Link. When I do a speedtest with the WRT1200ac everything is fine so I&#039;m a little baffled. If you have any suggestions, I am all ears. If you think it would be better just to go back to factory firmware then I am all for that as well. I like the WRT1200ac due to it&#039;s faster CPU &amp; more RAM than the TP-Link router, but if latency and ping is still going to be an issue then I absolutely cannot use it. </p><p>Just a fyi. I am fairly new when it comes to OpenWRT so if you could guide me to the best possible fix or if you think going back to the factory firmware is best I will do that as well. I thought about doing it and read the Wiki on how to do it, but I am a little stuck where is guides you to merge the PuTTY profile, save to vlan.sh and then run vlan.sh. Everything else I am usually pretty good with including navigating my way around the router UI. Thanks!</p>									</div>
