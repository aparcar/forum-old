					<p>cornelinux,<br />have a look in the log (&#039;logread&#039;). In absence of an ADSL connection you should see pppd keep on trying to get connected. It will show timeouts waiting for a certain kind of packets:<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:00:57 (none) kern.warn pppd[428]: Timeout waiting for PADS packets<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:00:57 (none) kern.err pppd[428]: Unable to complete PPPoE Discovery<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:00:57 (none) kern.info pppd[428]: Exit.<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:00:57 (none) user.info : Timeout waiting for PADS packets<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:00:57 (none) user.info : Unable to complete PPPoE Discovery<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:00:58 (none) kern.info pppd[742]: Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded.<br />Jan&nbsp; 1 00:00:58 (none) user.info : Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded.<br />etc. etc.</p><p>If this goes on forever it appears that the WRT54g is doing the right thing but that the modem is not connected properly to the provider, or that the ethernet connectivity wrt &lt;&gt; modem is lost. In any case the PPPoE protocol does not get a chance to negotiate a connection. Perhaps your modem has a problem ? Can you see the modem&#039;s status, e.g. via a ssh or telnet session to the modem or a modem web interface ?</p><p>Other possible causes:<br />1. the provider and/or local telecom is overloaded and there are more people asking for ADSL than they have modems in the exchange. So the exchange hangs up regularly.<br />2. Radio interference into the modem. Here (rural area with telephone wires above ground on poles) it turned out that the modem got overloaded with radio signals (long wave and medium wave broadcast which uses same spectrum as ADSL). These signals are the strongest when it is dark. This was cured by a &#039;common mode filter&#039; that only lets pass signals in the phone wire pair with opposite polarity in the two wires (like the desired ADSL signals). So the phone cable as a whole, that acts as excellent radio antenna producing radio signals of equal polarity on the two wires, cannot feed its radio signals to the modem any longer. The effect here has been remarkable. Before filtering the modem would report signal/noise on the downlink dropping to a few dB at 4 Mbps in the evening and night.<br />With filter it always stays above 10 dB. Dropping connections now happen seldom and always on moments that are popular for internet access (exchange overload).</p>									</div>

					<p>For what its worth, I have seen the same problem, not every day, but every few days (cant be sure of the time period, may well be consistent). I haven&#039;t needed to restart the router yet, killing pppd does the trick (it automatically restarts).</p><p>To answer the previous poster, no, logread shows nothing (for me). pppd is not trying to do anything. The ppp0 link is still up, but it simply doesnt work (I cant even ping the other end of the ppp connection).</p><p>Is it possible that an ip lease runs out and pppd is not renewing it or something?? I dont even know how dynamic ip&#039;s over ppp works btw, just a thought...</p><p>Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I should clarify that I am running CVS HEAD and not wr <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I am not running any special packages like pppoecd or roaring-penguin pppoe-client, just pppd with rp-pppoe plugin and the relevant kernel modules. The connection is automatically started on boot by /sbin/ifup.pppoe and works will until it stops after something like 48hrs.</p><p>Is some sort of pppoe client daemon necessary in addition to pppd? what does it do?</p><p>I&#039;m not in a great position to test your wr releases as I depend on cvs head for other stuff I am working on (audio) and taking it off for 2+ days for testing would be a neusance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Can you tell me what you have changed? Can I test these changes in cvs head instead?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Dave</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, after looking at /sbin/ifup.pppoe it looks like setting ppp_idletime and ppp_redialperiod might fix my problem (cause pppd to exit and subsequently be restarted by ifup.pppoe), I currently dont have either of these vars set at all!</p><p>Cornelius, perhaps you could try to set ppp_idletime to something greater than zero (eg. 1).</p><p>Based on the pppd manpage and my understaning of ifup.pppoe, lcp pings will be send to the peer every &quot;ppp_redialperiod&quot; seconds and if &quot;ppp_idletime&quot; pings go unanswered, pppd will asume the other end is dead and exit (at which point the ifup.pppeo script will restart it). It is unclear what a setting of 0 means for &quot;ppp_idletime&quot;, hence I suggest changing it to one.</p><p>I&#039;ll try this now and let you know in a couple of days <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Dave</p>									</div>
