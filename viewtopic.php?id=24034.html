					<p>I&#039;ve been operating Kamikaze 8.09.2 for some time with decent results.&nbsp; I have dropbear running with password login disabled and root user login using public key authentication only.&nbsp; Incidentally, if you are running dropbear with password login, you should check your log file because I guarantee that you are being brute-force attacked almost constantly.&nbsp; Eventually they are going to guess the password.</p><p>Anyhow, to further security, I would like to do three things: <br />1) disable root login and instead login with another user name<br />2) add that user to the sudoers file so that I can switch to root when necessary to execute commands as root<br />3) enable denyhosts to work so that brute-force attackers are automatically added to the block list.</p><p>It does not seem that I can do any of those three, however.&nbsp; Can anyone educate me?&nbsp; First, there is only one place to put key file (/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys), so I don&#039;t know how to have a key file be identified with a user other than root.&nbsp; Second, neither the sudoers file nor the sudo command seem to be on my system by default.&nbsp; Third, while denyhosts exists as an optware package, it only seems to work with openssh and not dropbear.&nbsp; Does dropbear have any function whatsoever to check a list of IP addresses and reject them?</p>									</div>

					<p>I solved my problem.&nbsp; Here&#039;s how:</p><p>1)&nbsp; I created a substitute root user in the group &quot;root&quot; on my system and gave it the same home dir as root.&nbsp; This just allows me to have a &quot;root&quot; user with a name that no one else knows (like disabling &quot;Administrator&quot; in Windows).</p><p>2)&nbsp; Dropbear will look in the user&#039;s home directory/.ssh/authorized_keys file if one attempts to log in as a username other than root.&nbsp; Dropbear seems to use the /etc/dropbear/authorize_keys file for root logins only, but will still check the home dir for the OpenSSH style keys file for other users.&nbsp; So, all I had to do was copy the authorized_keys file into the user&#039;s home dir into the .ssh directory (which I had to create).&nbsp; Be sure chown the .ssh directory to the user and chmod it recursively to 700 (or at least it must NOT be group or world writeable).&nbsp; This can be done for any number of user accounts on the machine.&nbsp; For my substitute root user, I created a dir /root as the home dir for root and put the .ssh directory there.</p><p>3)&nbsp; Now I checked to be sure that I could login with keys and not as root.</p><p>4)&nbsp; Now I needed to enable su&#039;ing to root.&nbsp; The problem was that the &quot;su&quot; command needed to be SUID.&nbsp; Mine was in /opt/bin and I was receiving the error that su must be suid to work properly.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod 4755 /opt/bin/su</code></pre></div><p>Now login as non-root and test with su -l. </p><p>5)&nbsp; Now I removed root logins.&nbsp; I had already removed password logins, so this is just one more layer of security.&nbsp; To do this, I had to modify the config script for dropbear.&nbsp; Note that I have also modified it so that two instances of dropbear run.&nbsp; One is on another port and blocked from access from the Internet.&nbsp; It is my failsafe to allow me to login using root and password authorization if I mess up the other one.&nbsp; Port 22 is exposed to the Internet, but has password auth and root logins disabled.&nbsp; Remember to be sure that port 2222 is NOT forwarded through your firewall.</p><p>Below is my dropbear file in /etc/config<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dropbear
        option PasswordAuth &#039;on&#039;
        option Port         &#039;2222&#039;
        option RootLogin    &#039;on&#039;

        option RootLogin    &#039;off&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Then I modified /etc/rc.d/S50dropbear to add the extra switch for disabling root login and I moved the start command inside the loop so that it will run as many times as &quot;config drobear&quot; lines that I have in the config file.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
