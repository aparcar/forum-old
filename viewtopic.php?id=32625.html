					<p>!google does not help me!</p><p>A hard disc is subdivided into sectors of equal size, that are either 512Byte or 4KiB (=Advanced Block Size)&nbsp; in size.<br />Such a sector is the smallest amount of space that can be read or written to by hardware controller.<br />When you format the harddisc, you install a filesystem to it, that also has subdivisions, these are called blocks.<br />I assume a block is the smallest amount of space that can be read of written to by the filesystem-&quot;driver&quot;/module.</p><p>AFAIK with NTFS all blocks have equal size, which can be 512Byte-64KiB in size.<br />At least, that is what I thought to know. Now &quot;man mkfs.ntfs&quot; tells different story:<br />1. It distinguished between sector-size and cluster-size. Sector-size can be 256-4096Bytes and cluster-size 256-65536Byte.<br />What&#039;s what?</p><p>1. With ext2, ext3 and ext4, do all fs blocks have an equals size?</p><br /><p>Now, my actual question, let&#039;s look at Flash memory: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Block_erasure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Block_erasure</a><br />You can only erase data by erasing one entire block. This block-size is hardwired.I think most common is 64KiB block size.</p><p>1. How do I ascertain the hard wired block-size of my USB stick?<br />2. Wouldn&#039;t it be prudent to choose (file-system block-size = erase block size)?<br />3. How do I do that?<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mkfs.ext2 -L &quot;&quot; /dev/sda1 -b (1024 or 2048 or 4096)</code></pre></div><p>ext2, 3 and- 4 allow maximum of 4096Byte/block.</p><p>Edit: To make it short: hard disc and flash memory are quite different, is it prudent to consider that when formating a medium?</p><p>Edit2: This is what I mean: <a href="http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=96370.0;wap2">http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.ph â€¦ 370.0;wap2</a><br />But I do not want to merely align the filesystem but also use bigger block (allocation unit) size. And with ext this is not possible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Orca</strong> on 27 Oct 2011, 16:27)</p>

					<p>A USB-Stick is a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/mtd">MTD (Memory Technology Device)</a> and the common filesystems are not optimal for them. I knew that. But dockstar bootloader only supports ext2!</p><p>And while we are at it, how come there is no UBIFS support on OpenWrt?</p><p>From the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/">FS in the Kernel</a> of course only a portion is supported, maybe UBIFS should be amongst them. Not instead of JFFS2 but as an FS for USB Sticks.</p><p>Can anybody tell how big the advantage of JFFS2/UBIFS is on MTDs compared to ext2?</p>									</div>

					<p>I quote <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/">http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/</a></p><p>Partitioning</p><p>When a filesystem wants to optimize its block allocation to the geometry of a flash drive, it needs to know the position of the segments on the drive. On partitioned media, this also implies that each partition is aligned to the start of a segment, and this is true for all preformatted SD cards and other media that require special care for segment optimizations.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fdisk and sfdisk tools from util-linux make it particularly hard to do this correctly, because they try to preserve an archaic geometry of 255 &quot;heads&quot; and 63 &quot;sectors&quot; and, by default, align partitions to &quot;cylinder&quot; boundaries. None of these units have any significance on today&#039;s hard drives or flash drives, but they are kept for backwards compatibility with existing software. The result is that most partitions are as misaligned as possible, they start on a odd-numbered 512-byte sector, which defeats all optimizations that a filesystem can do to align its accesses to logical blocks and segments inside of the partition.</p>									</div>
