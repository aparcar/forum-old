					<p>Hello all</p><p>We have been using Ubiquiti UAPs for a few years with OpenWRT and now LEDE.<br />However, we have found that Ubiquiti are starting to introduce Firmware images<br />that have RSA signatures and so block the installation of Third Party Firmware.<br />This is also happening at TP-Link with their competitor to the Ubiquiti UAP, the EAP<br />range. So we are looking at using something else that will work with OpenWRT / LEDE.</p><p>Does anyone have any recommendations on Ceiling Mounted Access Points?</p><p>Thanks, Richard.</p>									</div>
