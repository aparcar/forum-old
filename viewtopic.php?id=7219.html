					<p>Many of you have probably come to realize (like me) that the Nocatsplash package is terribly unstable and cannot be used in production. Has anyone found a resolution to the problems (Segmentation Error, port not unbinding upon quit) or an alternative solution? Personally, I am looking for a product that provides the functionality of a captive portal but without a user authentication system. A basic &quot;splash&quot; page with an I accept button.</p><p>m0n0wall is too large to be installed on an openwrt appliance.<br />Chillispot I believe requires radius authentication.</p><p>Any ideas or suggestions will be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Benjamin Hecht</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>acompw</strong> on 7 Sep 2006, 04:24)</p>

					<p>Whilst it is a captive portal solution customised for the Melbourne Wireless community network, some of you may be interested in looking at MWHotspot.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically a patched busybox httpd that does redirects on error pages, plus some ipatables stuff and MAC whitelists.&nbsp; It is configurable via easy-to-use helper scripts so you can add MAC addresses to the whitelist to allow internet access (with different priority levels) - you aren&#039;t forced to use the Melbourne Wireless access control list (membership database).</p><p>Source code, docs and an ipk are available here:<br /><a href="http://melbournewireless.org.au/files/wrt54/Packages/">http://melbournewireless.org.au/files/wrt54/Packages/</a><br /><a href="http://melbournewireless.org.au/wiki/?MWRPHotspot">http://melbournewireless.org.au/wiki/?MWRPHotspot</a></p><p>I&#039;ve played with it and found it to be very stable.&nbsp; It has already provided some inspiration to the authors of DHCPSplash - a captive portal package for the Freifunk-Firmware.</p><p><a href="http://znerol.ch/svn/freifunk-dhcpsplash/trunk/README">http://znerol.ch/svn/freifunk-dhcpsplash/trunk/README</a></p>									</div>

					<p>danversj - how do you select a zone? I press #1 in the menu but then it asks me for input for each of the 4 or 5 zones. What am I supposed to type. Then when i press 2 in the menu for configure zone, it says that a particular zone has not been configured.</p><p>During the install, my firewall file was modified and now I cannot logon to the internet or use any service. Is this normal? Thanks.</p><p>Benjamin Hecht</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>acompw</strong> on 10 Sep 2006, 02:26)</p>

					<p>Yes it&#039;s normal <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; The package overwrites your firewall file.&nbsp; It still is a beta package.&nbsp; The script needs a bit of ironing out - sorry I should have warned about that.&nbsp; You need to run the configure script, then save your settings then when you run it again it will show the zones as set.&nbsp; Check out the wiki page <a href="http://melbournewireless.org.au/wiki/?MWRPHotspot">http://melbournewireless.org.au/wiki/?MWRPHotspot</a> for a bit more info.</p><p>It&#039;s probably locking you out of the internet because you need to configure MWHotspot to to let your MAC address through - MWHotspot probably considers you to be an unauthenticated user.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m Steve, one of the folks that work on MWRP hotspot. I agree, the zones stuff is a tad confusing, so I&#039;ve actually re-written a lot of this in the latest CVS version. You would need to build the ipkg yourself from the CVS checkout (just type &#039;make&#039;) and install it that way...</p><p>A lot of discussion has taken place lately on how to make this software portable between groups, and how to make it much easier to configure.</p><p>The one nice thing is that the same package can be used on x86 hardware as well as OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m working on doing a few changes to the modified httpd at the moment - and it does conflict with the webif package (something which is annoying), however we&#039;re trying to work out a way to still get the captive portal and web interface working together, however it doesn&#039;t look good at the moment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CRC</strong> on 10 Sep 2006, 15:50)</p>

					<p>Hey CRC,<br />I have had to look for other solutions because the setup was a bit confusing and the wiki is a bit unclear on what to exactly do. I&#039;m looking forward to your 1.0 release.

					<p>Might be an idea to give version 0.8.6 of mwhotspot a go... I&#039;ve done a lot of work on it this week to get it ready for an upcoming event. You can get the package directly at:</p><p><a href="http://melbourne.wireless.org.au/files/wrt54/Packages/mwhotspot_0.8.6_mipsel.ipk">http://melbourne.wireless.org.au/files/ … mipsel.ipk</a></p><p>or, if you&#039;ve already installed it once (even if you&#039;ve removed it), you can just do an &quot;ipkg update&quot; then &quot;ipkg install mwhotspot&quot; and it will pull down the latest version - as we install our repository when you install the package.</p><p>If you find any issues with it, please feel free to contact me via email and I&#039;ll try to help the best I can.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, here&#039;s a possible alternative...</p><p>Being annoyed with Nocatsplash breaking on recent White Russian releases, and with the infrastructure complexity of Wifidog and Chilispot, I wrote a Nocatsplash replacement derived from the Wifidog code base.&nbsp; Being a kind of mashup of Nocatsplash and Wifidog, it&#039;s called Nodogsplash.</p><p>I&#039;ve been testing it on a mostly stock OpenWRT White Russian 0.9 system, and it&#039;s been working well here.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to hear if it&#039;s useful to others.&nbsp; </p><p>For the ipk package, a source tarball, and some documentation, see <a href="http://kokoro.ucsd.edu/nodogsplash/">http://kokoro.ucsd.edu/nodogsplash/</a>.</p><p>Let me know what you think...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Paul <br />nodogsplash (at) kokoro.ucsd.edu</p>									</div>
