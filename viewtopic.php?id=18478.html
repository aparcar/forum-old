					<p>Hello,<br />after trying samba I&#039;m now trying NFS to create share folder over my network. I gave up sama cos it has really poor peroframnces but now I discover that NFS is not much better. I&#039;m using <strong>unfs</strong> on openwrt 8.09 and I can get about 900 KB/s for writing and 1.1 MB/for reading.</p><p>Does somebody has better performances ?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Tex</p>									</div>
