					<p>I currently have two TL-WR1043ND routers, both of which are set up with OpenWRT (which is awesomely brilliant so far) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>I need to make a few configuration changes though, and I would love to get the communities&#039; opinion -- as they know it best!</p><p>This is my proposed configuration;</p><p><strong>Router One</strong><br />- Set-up with my ADSL2 modem, as my main router. <br />- Two SSID&#039;s -- one a hotspot, the other a private network.<br />- Proposed third SSID to connect the two routers (too much for the chipset to handle?)</p><p><strong>Router Two</strong><br />- Using a USB Hub; connected to a printer and a scanner<br />- Doesn&#039;t need to repeat the private network, nor hotspot network<br />- But, cannot be connected to Router One via Ethernet</p><p><strong>The Question</strong><br />I was wondering what the best Wifi mode would be to connect the two routers so that the printer would be accessible through the private LAN network on Router One? I assume if I just made router two a client, that it would purely host the printer and scanner? Should I create a new SSID just for bridging the two routers?<br />Additionally, if I were to (for any reason) decide to connect a laptop (for example) to Router two, would that be usable on the private LAN on router one using a specific AP method? How would this affect performance?</p><p>I&#039;m happy to clarify anything, because I may have missed something! Any assistance would be appreciated!</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ShadowXVII</strong> on 23 Oct 2011, 11:51)</p>
