					<p>I am working on a project on OpenWRT x86. The installation script I am trying to run requires the readlink command; however, I have been unable to find it in the OpenWRT build. I have attempted to install Linux-compatible coreutil packages to no avail. I saw one very old post on a forum found through Bing that talked about compiling a version of readlink for the OS, but it gave no instructions.</p><p>This is slightly beyond my level of expertise and any assistance would be appreciated.</p><br /><p>Thank You</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWRT uses busybox, and busybox can supply readlink. So have a look in your busybox settings.</p><p>If that is no option, you can emulate readlink with a simple script:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
ls -l $1 | awk &#039;{print $11}&#039;</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>1. How would I go about verifying my busybox settings include the ability for readlink?</p><p>Edit: I have been able to figure out that my version of Busybox does not include readlink. - See #3.</p><br /><p>2. How would I utilize your suggestion in place of a script command?</p><p>D1=$(readlink -f &quot;$0&quot;)</p><br /><p>Edit:</p><p>3. Now that I know I don&#039;t have readlink in my busybox install, what is the best way to replace my version with one that does? e.g. I know busybox can be compiled quite easily, but, what is the recommended way to replace the existing package?</p><br /><br /><p>Thank You</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jcpt928</strong> on 1 May 2014, 15:50)</p>

					<p>When you get a &#039;not found&#039; on a binary which is just available, I guess the binary is dependent on a library which isn&#039;t there. Possible libc, as OpenWRT uses uclibc.</p>									</div>
