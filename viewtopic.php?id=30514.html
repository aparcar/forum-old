					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I have an Asus eeepc 4g series 700, the very first eeepc model.<br />I&#039;ve used it a bit in the past, not that much, but it was useful form time to time. Right now it&#039;s just collecting dust in a shelf<br />For some reason, the battery stopped working, the computer dies at once if I take unplug the power. It&#039;s pretty useless to me, even if the battery would work, I don&#039;t think I have much use for it, if any at all.</p><p>Routers are ridiculously cheap these days, but I&#039;m kind of an ecologist so I think it&#039;s just unnecessary to buy a router when I have perfectly capable hardware of much higher specs I can use.</p><p>I searched the forums and the wiki and didn&#039;t find much information about this. I&#039;m guessing the x86 build should work out of the box. Does it? If not, what configurations/modifications are necessary?Has anybody tried it on an eeepc?</p><p>I&#039;m comfortable with more advanced installation procedures, but I&#039;m not sure I am willing to spend like a whole day patching and compiling drivers, etc. I.e. I might just grab a router if the installation requires much time and work.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got nothing against OpenWrt, but since you&#039;ve got plenty of RAM and SSD, you might want to consider running a lightweight Debian installation on it (see <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC/Model/701">this page</a>), and just configure it as a router.&nbsp; The ath5k driver in recent Linux kernels supports hostap mode, so you can set it up as an access point.</p>									</div>

So the answer is yes? Can I just intall the x86 build anb be happy? Or are there any issues I should be aware of?</p>									</div>

					<p>I know this is an old thread, but the following procedure might be useful to anyone else who comes here. The same resulting image has been tested with a 701 and a 900, but I suspect it will work with a 700 as well (perhaps someone else can confirm). Based on tomlase&#039;s comment, I dug around until I found the ethernet and wifi modules required, plus the USB modules. I took one look at the docs for creating a build environment and thought, &quot;Life&#039;s too short.&quot; So instead, I just modified the generic image in a VM and converted the VMDK back to a raw image for writing to the Eee PC. Here&#039;s my step-by-step, using Windows as the build platform:</p><p>You will need:<br /></p><ul><li><p>VMware player</p></li><li><p>the generic X86 OpenWRT image</p></li><li><p>the qemu-img.exe and libssp-0.dll files from the QEMU Windows package</p></li><li><p>a bootable USB flash drive containing System Rescue CD 4.5.2 or later, with at least 80MB spare</p></li></ul><p>Stage I<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>Create a VM using the instructions <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vmware">here</a>. Note that if you use VMware Player, you won&#039;t have a choice of NIC, it will default to pcnet32.</p></li><li><p>Boot the VM and set both interfaces to dhcp IPv4</p></li><li><p>uci commit</p></li><li><p>passwd</p></li><li><p>sync ; reboot</p></li></ol><p>Stage II<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>opkg update</p></li><li><p>opkg remove kmod-3c59x kmod-8139too kmod-e100 kmod-e1000 kmod-ne2k kmod-sis900 kmod-r8169 r8169-firmware kmod-via-rhine kmod-via-velocity</p></li><li><p>opkg install kmod-8021q kmod-ath5k kmod-atl2 kmod-usb-core kmod-usb-hid kmod-usb2 kmod-usb-wdm</p></li><li><p>opkg install kmod-mmc kmod-usb-storage kmod-usb-storage-extras usbreset usbutils</p></li><li><p>opkg install kmod-fs-ext4 kmod-fs-ntfs kmod-fs-vfat e2fsprogs fdisk ntfs-3g</p></li><li><p>opkg install hostapd hostapd-utils iwinfo wpad</p></li><li><p>Since you&#039;ve got plenty of room, why not add some more useful packages:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; opkg install diffutils ip-full lftp procps tcpdump vim</p></li><li><p>sync ; reboot</p></li><li><p>login via LuCI and make sure everything is as you would expect</p></li></ol><p>Stage III<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>halt</p></li><li><p>convert the vmdk back to a raw img file using qemu:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>qemu-img convert -f vmdk openwrt-x86-generic-combined-ext4.vmdk -O raw openwrt-x86-eeepc-combined-ext4.img</strong></p></li><li><p>copy the new img file to a folder on your SystemRescueCD USB drive (note which folder you used)</p></li><li><p>boot the target machine with the USB drive until you get a command line</p></li><li><p><strong>dd if=/path/to/openwrt-x86-eeepc-combined-ext4.img of=/dev/sda</strong></p></li><li><p>startx and then run gparted</p></li><li><p>use gparted to expand sda2 into the free space on the disk</p></li><li><p>reboot the Eee PC and off you go.</p></li></ol>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jrdld</strong> on 9 Sep 2015, 12:35)</p>
