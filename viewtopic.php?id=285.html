					<p>Hi everyone, just got my WRT54G the other day and am thoroughly enjoying running Linux on it!</p><p>With some pointers from a couple of guys from #wrt54g, I made a couple of packages for myself that others might find useful.&nbsp; One is for <a href="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/nsd/">nsd</a>, an authoritative nameserver.&nbsp; The other is for <a href="http://www.openntpd.org/">OpenNTPD</a>, an NTP server/client that&#039;s a fair bit smaller than the standard ntpd.&nbsp; The packages are at <a href="http://mcc.id.au/openwrt/">http://mcc.id.au/openwrt/</a>.</p><p>Now, I&#039;m trying to get another thing cross compiled for my WRT but the configure script is having a fit because it can&#039;t run some of its test programs, due to it generating binaries for the WRT and not being able to run them.&nbsp; Is there a publicly accessible machine that can be used for natively compiling things for the WRT, <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/projects/skiffcluster.html">as handhelds.org do for the iPAQ</a>?&nbsp; If not, any hints on getting a native build environment going?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing some NFS mounted storage space.&nbsp; What packages will I need?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Cameron</p>									</div>
