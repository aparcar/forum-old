					<p>I&#039;ve been looking for an OpenWrt 15.05-supported router with enough flash memory to run OpenVPN that is around $50 or under. So far, I&#039;ve found a lot of TP-Links around that price, but none of them seem to have enough memory.</p><p>For example, I thought I would have a few MB of free space if I bought a router with 8 MB of flash memory like the TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v2, but when I checked the corresponding factory image, the image was nearly 8 MB! The cheaper TP-Links that have only 4 MB of flash memory have images between 3-4 MB. It&#039;s almost as if someone compiled a bigger image to take advantage of the larger flash memory.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure how much flash memory I need, but the packages I need installed are luci-app-openvpn and all its dependencies. Does anyone know if there&#039;s a way to check how much space these packages need? In desktop operating systems, apt-get tells you how much you need to download and how much free space will be used before you commit to anything?. Does opkg do the same thing <strong>before</strong> you start downloading/installing? I&#039;ve seen stories here on the forum of people installing a package that was too big and then being unable to clean it up without going into failsafe.</p><p>Suggestions are welcome.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>withflair</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 22:01)</p>

					<p>Take a look at the sysupgrade files to get a size estimate. Due to padding, the factory ones always correspond to the flash size (minus u-boot, u-boot data and ART). And yes, depending on what else you might want, OpenVPN does still into 8 MB flash for now.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 22:40)</p>

					<p>Do you know roughly how much space OpenVPN and its dependencies take up? The only other things I need are DNSSEC and DNSCrypt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>withflair</strong> on 27 Sep 2015, 22:47)</p>

					<p>From my OpenVPN install notes of which I choose 2 files, and then you can see the installed dependencies.&nbsp; Go to the packages to find the sizes.&nbsp; I do not have that.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install openvpn-openssl
