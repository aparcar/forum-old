					<p>In Network =&gt; Interfaces, and again in Firewall, each element is assigned a color.&nbsp; It appears that red is for WAN and green for LAN, but there are shades of some of these colors (light red and light green) and other colors (blue, gray, purple that I have seen).&nbsp; I assume that they have some meaning, but am unable to find info on these.&nbsp; Is there a list of these and their meanings someplace?</p><p>I have just tried to configure a Guest interface using the recipe and the interface is a different green (from LAN) but not purple as indicated in the wiki.&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/gu … binterface</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I was wondering about that too recently, I don&#039;t currently have a guest interface, but when I did it was tan instead of the purple in the wiki, might have to make one again just to see if the color changes.</p>									</div>
