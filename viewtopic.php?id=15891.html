					<p>[s]<strong>Update:</strong> Forgot to mention, binary packages provided for mipsel are for 2.4 kernel. Not sure if they will work with 2.6 kernel.[/s]</p><p><strong>Homepage:</strong> <a href="http://remotefs.sourceforge.net">http://remotefs.sourceforge.net</a>/</p><p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;d like to present you remotefs i&#039;ve implemented for use with my NAS.</p><p>The reasons i&#039;ve decided to make it are a) samba isn&#039;t working for me at all b) NFS is not working well for me c) sshfs is great, but not very fast.</p><p>Iï»¿n comparison with sshfs, reading performance on my hardware has improved roughly three times and writing performance has almost doubled. So if you have trouble with samba and NFS (as I do), then you may be interested in remotefs.</p><p>Iâ€™ve quickly put together this solution using FUSE. I&#039;m using Asus WL-500gP with OpenWrt, so i&#039;ve built server package for Kamikaze (mipsel). Client package is available for Debian-based i386 systems. Build scripts are available in SVN, so you could make packages for your platform(s) if you wish so.</p><p>The project is hosted at SourceForge: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/remotefs">https://sourceforge.net/projects/remotefs</a> , where you can get all sources and build scripts in SVN. Binary packages are available in downloads section: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=229928">https://sourceforge.net/project/showfil … _id=229928</a>.</p><p>First, a warning: it is still in beta and should never be exposed to untrusted networks.<br />Second, before you start using it (even for testing), take a look at the release notes for details on known issues. (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=604185&amp;group_id=229928">https://sourceforge.net/project/shownot … _id=229928</a>)</p><p>Mini-howto:</p><p>Starting the server: <br />/etc/init.d/rfsd start (do not forget to write down exports in /etc/rfs-exports and set passwords with rfspasswd utility (if you need them)).</p><p>Exports file:<br />The file is NFS-like, except there are no options for export entry and no subnet mask for ip-addresses.</p><p>Client setup:</p><p>Mounting export: <br />rfs 10.0.0.1:/mnt/usb/store begemoth/</p><p>It is NFS/sshfs like. If you are not familiar with it, here is its format: â€œrfs host:export_name mount_point&quot;. Host is ip-address or host name, export name is the string from exports file, mount_point&nbsp; has the same meaning as in the any other mount operation.</p><p>You may also specify username/password or FUSE option(s). See rfs -h for details.</p><p>If you interested in the project or feel there&#039;s a feature missing, or have suggestions or any remarks, I&#039;d be glad to hear from you by e-mail at aleksey_t@users.sourceforge.net.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aleksey_t</strong> on 12 Feb 2011, 22:43)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve done some work to improve read/write performance and managed to get more than 2.5Mb/s both ways on my hardware (WL-500gP). This performance improvement is good for large files only. An application which writes small amounts of data to many files will not experience a performance increase in comparison with the previous version of remotefs.</p><p>Cache which is used for this improvement will consume up to 1,5Mb RAM (on client&#039;s side and up to 512Kb on server&#039;s) from time to time, but I guess it is worth it. This feature is optional as it is not enabled by default (yet). Use rfs options -ord_cache=1, -owr_cache=1, or -ordwr_cache=1 to enable reading cache, writing cache, or both.</p><p>Example: rfs 10.0.0.1:/mnt/usb/store begemoth/ -ordwr_cache=1</p><p>You can also specify which port and which address the server will listen to. Use -a [address] and -p [port_number] options. Defaults are specified in /etc/init.d/rfsd script.</p><p>Salt for password encryption has been changed to an empty string. All previously set passwords will need to be reset.

					<p>I&#039;ve rewritten my write cache implementation and now it may potentially consume 758Kb less memory on client&#039;s side and 256Kb less on server&#039;s while transferring large files. You may experience a little (a *very* little) write performance degradation. Most likely performance will be the same as in version 0.8.</p><p>Since version 0.9, both read and write caches are enabled by default. You may use options -ord_cache=0, -owr_cache=0, and -ordwr_cache=0 to disable read cache, write cache or both.</p><p>New feature: read-only exports. Read-only exports can be defined like this: /tmp 127.0.0.1, alex, 10.0.0.2 (ro)</p><p>Server is now able to lower privileges to specified user using -u [username] option. Make note that rfsd will get filesystem permissions of specified user and it still needs to be initially run by root to properly do chroot(). After mounting of export (chroot()), process&#039;s user id will be changed to the one specified with -u option. Default user (root) is specified in the /etc/init.d/rfsd script.</p><p><strong>I&#039;m currently looking for people who could review code and point out security issues. Any help would be appreciated.</strong></p><p>Next release will be most likely the final one â€“ I&#039;ve implemented everything I expected from remotefs, but there wonâ€™t be a 1.0 release until the code has been reviewed for security issues as mentioned above. Since this review will probably not happen in the nearest future, if you interested in remotefs, I suggest you to use this release as final, but without exposing rfsd to untrusted networks.</p><p>Please take a look at changelog for more details on chages made: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=608613&amp;group_id=229928">http://sourceforge.net/project/shownote … _id=229928</a></p><p>Download link for 0.9 release: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=229928&amp;package_id=278622&amp;release_id=608613">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfile … _id=608613</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>With new developer who joined the project, we were working on performance optimization and gained a significant improvement. I&#039;ve managed to get 3,5Mb/s on my hardware while reading a (large) file from NAS and 4.0Mb/s while writing a file to NAS. Version 0.10 has also (really) fast directory listing.</p><p>This release also has some nice features you may find useful: <br />- auto-reconnect<br />- reload support if you changed server settings (exports and/or passwords) and don&#039;t want to restart all remotefs connections<br />- IPv6 support (in SVN only) <br />- access rights lowering for each export with options &quot;user=&quot;&nbsp; and &quot;group=&quot;&nbsp; in exports file.</p><p>New major feature is support of UGO-model: if you&#039;ll specify &quot;ugo&quot;&nbsp; option for export, rfsd will act a lot like NFS server â€“ it will log the user into the remote system setting its pid, gid and setting up groups for username. You need to create users with the names same as you use for logging in to rfsd. Server&#039;s and client&#039;s users (/etc/passwd) and groups (/etc/group) need to be synchronized. remotefs could work without synced systems, but in this case you would potentially get some side effects, like mistakenly reported file owner and group. Please refer to man pages for a more detailed description of these side effects.</p><p>We have also updated documentation with man pages, you could find it here: rfsd: <a href="http://remotefs.sourceforge.net/rfspasswd.8.html">http://remotefs.sourceforge.net/rfspasswd.8.html</a> , rfspasswd: <a href="http://remotefs.sourceforge.net/rfsd.8.html">http://remotefs.sourceforge.net/rfsd.8.html</a> , rfs: <a href="http://remotefs.sourceforge.net/rfs.1.html">http://remotefs.sourceforge.net/rfs.1.html</a> .</p><p>Download link: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=229928&amp;package_id=278622&amp;release_id=634369">https://sourceforge.net/project/showfil … _id=634369</a><br />Changelog: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=634369&amp;group_id=229928">https://sourceforge.net/project/shownot … _id=229928</a></p><p>Still in beta, do not expose to untrusted network(s).

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I faced the problem trying to use remotefs: I&#039;ve installed server to OpenWrt 10.03.1 RC4 from the package from OpenWrt repo for my router (MIPS/ar71xx). It is build 854.

					<p>It&#039;s client-server incompatibility indeed, your configuration looks ok. Concerning architecture issues - packages on SF are for kamikaze and not for backfire, unfortunately. I&#039;m working on it.</p><p>If 845 is a SVN revision, then your server package corresponds to remotefs 0.12 (most likely) or 0.11.</p><p>Or if you wish to try a quick hack (didn&#039;t tried, but should work), then i can suggest to edit file &quot;control.tar.gz/control&quot; inside of rfsd_0.14-1_???.ipk (it&#039;s just archive file) and replace mips with your architecture (`opkg print-architecture`, i have brcm-2.4 on my 10.03.1-rc4) or all. The only thing changed for remotefs packaging is architecture name, really.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aleksey_t</strong> on 24 Jan 2011, 16:23)</p>

					<p>aleksey_t, thank you, now it works!</p><p>Sabayon Linux is Gentoo-based distro that has the same portage system as Gentoo. And all the commands for ebuilds management are the same: emerge, ebuild, layman, etc. Moreover it has no its own portage tree at all and uses Gentoo&#039;s one. So I think Sabayon is just the same as Gentoo in the sense of ebuilds installation.<br />To install ebuild I must generate its digest first, right? But operation fails with &quot;IUSE contains defaults, but EAPI doesn&#039;t allow them&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m glad it&#039;s fixed. Thank you for the feedback.</p><p>Concerning ebuilds, well, they worked for the time of 0.14 release. Google says something has changed in portage. Ebuilds will be adjusted before 0.15 release to cover this issue (and/or remotefs changes in makefiles).</p>									</div>
