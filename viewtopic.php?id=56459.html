					<p>I have a Huwaei / Vodafone HG556a, trying to get OpenWrt on it.</p><p>I&#039;m somewhat stuck, because:</p><ul><li><p>I don&#039;t know what hardware version I have. The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/huawei/hg556a">wiki&#039;s</a> table of supported router models / versions does not list the serial number of the one I have (mine starts with 31110, which is not in the list.) Trying to telnet to the router to run &quot;hwversion show&quot;, as mentioned in the wiki, fails with a &quot;connection refused by remote host&quot; error.</p></li><li><p>When I open it up, the PCB is somewhat different from the photos. I presume this and the different serial number is because I have a different revision of the board ?</p></li></ul><p>The other problem is that <strong>any</strong> firmware I try to upload through the web interface (after pulling the power, hold &quot;restart&quot; button, plug power, and keep holding the button for 20 secs) is rejected with an &quot;the uploaded firmware contains an illegal image&quot; error. This might be because the firmware contains a list of &quot;compatible&quot; serial numbers, and mine is different ?</p><p>Any ideas ? Any insight from someone who flashed this router before ?&nbsp; Sorry for n00b question :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok let us see those PCB pictures. Is it really a HG556a router, what does the label at the back of the router show? more pics</p><p>It rejects the image because the header does not meet requeriments the CFE of your router wants. You should provide an OEM firmware your router is able to flash, for analyzing the header to see if it can be solved.</p><p>Additionally you could connect a serial console to see the bootloader output, and check if it was intentionally crippled by Huawei.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, the Si3050 chip shouldn&#039;t be important, apart from this, it&#039;s exactly the same board. If it rejects the firmware, then the culprit is the bootloader, might be too old or too new.</p><p>You could try to downgrade the bootloader using an OEM firmware with the bootloader included, try with this one:</p><p><a href="https://broadband.vodafone.ie/download/files/HG556a_B025.zip">https://broadband.vodafone.ie/download/ … a_B025.zip</a></p><p>After flashing this firmware&nbsp; you should be able to flash any openwrt firmware. Your hardware version is B.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can use the TFTP flashing procedure via serial console, but not sure if it will make any difference.</p><p>With the current firmware, did you login as admin user?, with latest versions login/pass should be advanced/advanced.
