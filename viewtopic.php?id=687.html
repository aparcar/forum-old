					<p>Hi!</p><p>The default ifup script shipped with OpenWRT has a rather serious bug regarding pppoe, it calls pppoecd with the wrong parameters causing PPPoE to function unreliably. The attached ifup.diff patch fixes this and additionally tries to make the network device pid file handling a bit cleaner.</p><p>Greetings,</p><p>&nbsp; Gunter</p>									</div>

I don&#039;t know Sveasoft&#039;s Firmware, but maybe one should at least then replace my patch with one that updates the comments in /sbin/ifup, explicitely stating that the call which seems to do thing (a) does something different in reality?
