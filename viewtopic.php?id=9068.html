					<p>Hi,<br />I posted this in general discussion, but realise it&#039;s more suited to here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I understand that the D-Link DSL-300T ADSL modem is supported by the work in progress AR7 branch? Perhaps not direclty, but I&#039;ve seen on here that it can be done.</p><p>Does this mean that the DSL-320T ADSL2/2+ modem will also be supported too? I cannot find much information on this modem. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s just a UK or European model. D-Link provide GPL source code here:</p><p><a href="ftp://ftp.dlink.co.uk/GPL/DSL-320T_GPL.tgz">ftp://ftp.dlink.co.uk/GPL/DSL-320T_GPL.tgz</a></p><p>So I guess it&#039;s definately Linux based. Could someone with a bit (a lot sad) better knowledge than me give any advice on this?<br />Many thanks.</p>									</div>
