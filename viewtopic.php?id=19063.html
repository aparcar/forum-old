					<p>Hello!</p><p>I made a terrible mistake when installing openwrt.&nbsp; I tried flashing it over the wireless interface.&nbsp; I know, I know.</p><p>So, the thing is toast.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just tried the documented TFTP method with a bit of success:</p><p>The router is a wrtsl54gs v1.1 and I&#039;m using&nbsp; openwrt-wrtsl54gs-squashfs.bin</p><p>I ifconfig&#039;ed my linux box to have 192.168.1.33.&nbsp; TFPT&#039;ed the firmware from the laptop to the router via an ethernet cable directly from eth on laptop to Ethernet 1 on router (not internet)<br />I got this:<br />blah blah<br />sent DATA &lt;block=2770, 512 bytes&gt;<br />received ACK &lt;block=2770&gt;<br />sent DATA &lt;block=2771, 0 bytes&gt;<br />received ACK &lt;block=2771&gt;<br />Sent 1418240 bytes in 7.6 seconds [1492884 bits/sec]</p><p>So - I assume that means it was sent successfully.&nbsp; I let it sit there for quite some time.&nbsp; The orange &quot;Easy Setup&quot; button was lit after it rebooted.&nbsp; Let it sit.. Gave it about 20mins.&nbsp; </p><p>Now, I can&#039;t access the thing.&nbsp; I can&#039;t ping 192.168.1.1 - the address i TFTPed to successfully.&nbsp; I did an nmap -sP ping scan on 192.168.0.0/16 and got only .33 (laptop) as up.</p><p>Now - weirder, or maybe not - if I power cycle the router, i lose my .33 on the laptop and have to ifconfig it again.</p><p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok - so it turns out that this guy was previously set-up and I was able to access it via wifi.&nbsp; I enabled the wifi on my laptop, joined the linksys&#039; wireless network and was able to ssh in.</p><p>The question is this - when physically connected, why can&#039;t i ssh in?&nbsp; Why do I need to be on the wifi?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you flash *.bin file you may try tftp command&nbsp; &quot;binary&quot; before &quot;put&quot;. It helped me in similar situation. I flashed from Ubuntu.</p>									</div>
