					<p>My DDNS service is stopped whenever I check on it on luci&#039;s DDNS page. I start it using the &#039;Start&#039; button but when I check its status it&#039;s stopped again. Is this normal, I mean is the service shut down and then run when needed by another process or do I have a problem.</p><p>SOLVED - I had an entry in my /etc/hosts file pointing to an internal ip address and ddns was finding this address and attempting to update my ddns provider with the local address which caused an error and stoppage of the ddns service. I removed the hosts file entry and everything works.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robrob</strong> on 5 Dec 2014, 17:29)</p>

					<p>Chris, thanks for pointing out the obvious to me (not being sarcastic). I&#039;m running a 1 week old trunk build with luci. &#039;Force Interval&#039; is set to 72 hours.
