					<p>I want do to set up a guest wifi but i use a dedicated wifi access point. <br />I don&#039;t want to have the guest wifi any access to my local lan. <br />Is there any tutorial how to set up this with an external AP? <br />I only found tutorials on how to setup a guest wifi on the router directly.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ahh, that tutorial worked perfectly. In my case german was even preferred, but maybe someone should translate it to english (even if it uses already the englishs translation for luci). I haven&#039;t found anything comparable neither in english nor in german language. And also good explained, i even understood how it worked instead just following click-here-then-click-there tutorial. </p><p>Thx very much for the link.</p>									</div>
