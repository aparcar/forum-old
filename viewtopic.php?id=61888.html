					<p>I&#039;ve got a TP-Link Archer D5. This particular model isn&#039;t listed in the OpenWRT Hardware Wiki yet, but other TP-Link Archer routers are, such as the Archer C5:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp-link/tp-link_archerc5ac1200_120">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/tp-l … ac1200_120</a></p><p>I&#039;m hoping that the hardware will be similar enough to make it possible to run on the Archer D5. The only issue is that I don&#039;t know how to check what hardware is in use on the Archer D5. The TP-Link website has this documentation, but can&#039;t see anything about the chipset in use, etc...</p><p><a href="http://www.tplink.com/be/support/download/?model=Archer+D5&amp;version=V1">http://www.tplink.com/be/support/downlo … version=V1</a></p><p>I believe the difference between the C5 and the D5 is that the D5 has a built-in ADSL modem, but I&#039;d like to try and confirm the hardware in use before flashing the D5 to minimise the risk of bricking it. Is there any way to do a &#039;hardware scan&#039; before installing OpenWRT? Any tools I could use to look for the drivers I&#039;d need (ideally without cracking open the case)?</p>									</div>

					<p>As an alternative to scanning before installing, is it possible to install a minimal image and add drivers until the device is fully working (at least, as far as possible)?</p><p>Also, is it possible to go back to the default firmware if OpenWRT fails to work?</p>									</div>

					<p>Following on from what I&#039;ve said already, looks like some similar TP-Link routers have U-Boot in the OEM firmware, which may prove useful to me, but I can&#039;t understand what is meant by &#039;press tpl to enter U-Boot console on OEM firmware)&#039; (see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a> for context). What is tpl and how do I use it?</p><p>Also, does anyone know if it&#039;s possible to get a remote shell (Telnet/SSH) on any TP-Link Archer routers (using the default firmware)?</p>									</div>
