					<p>I am having a few problems getting a client bridge setup between a WRT54GL and a WRT54GC. The rough network diagram is below:</p><p>--- - Wireless Connections<br /> | - Wired Connections</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Internet&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Modem&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wireless&nbsp; ----&nbsp; WRT54GL&nbsp; &nbsp; ------- Wireless Bridge ---------&nbsp; WRT54GC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Client&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PC1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PC2</p><p>The WRT54GL is running Kamikaze 7.06 2.4 Kernel and the WRT54GC is running the standard linksys firmware (if only OpenWRT would go on here!). There is a working (well it seems to be) wireless bridge between the GL and the GC with the SSID of BRIDGE. There is a second Wlan interface on the GL with SSID of WIRELESS that the wireless clients connect to. No wireless clients are connecting to the GC. Basically the problem I am having is that all PC&#039;s connected to the GL (wired or wireless) can access all other PC&#039;s including PC2 as well as the internet. PC2 can access all other pc&#039;s on the GL and GC, but CAN&#039;T access the internet. </p><p>All PC&#039;s, wired and wireless are on the same 192.168.0.0/24 subnet. There is a subnet between the GL and the modem of 192.168.1.0/24. PC2 recieves IP information, including gateway, from the DHCP server on the GL.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Can anyone suggest some changes I would need to make to be able to get PC2 to connect to the internet? I&#039;m also having problems getting WPA PSK working on the bridge. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Config files are:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/config# cat network

					<p>Are you sure your this is working. I want to try this. </p><p>I have a doubt because how wl0 can have 2 SSID&#039;s<br />&quot;WIRELESS&quot; &amp; &quot;BRIDGE&quot;. </p><p>If this working for you, why don&#039;t you try interchanging your router.</p>									</div>

					<p>just to confirm WRT54GC is running a linksys firmware and pc2 can&#039;t access the internet but can access pc1.</p><p>If memory serves correctly the WRT54GC&nbsp; has a default route out its wan port, you will need to add a static route in it to WRT54GL&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>-----------<br />ignore above the how segment is one ethernet segment.</p><p>1) check the default route on pc2 is it pointing to WRT54GL (check the routing setup)<br />2) tcpdump on WRT54GL looking for a ping from pc2 to google.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;you should see an arp request for the ip address and then an ip packet<br />3) if the above doesn&#039;t produce any thing, try a tcpdump on pc2 (if its windows you can get wireshark for it) and look at it, I would guess that WRT54GC is hijacking the packets.</p>									</div>
