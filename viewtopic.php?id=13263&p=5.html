					<p>Hi,<br />I have a new Problem using Kamikaze Revision 10433 Kernel 2.6 and using your dctcs-kam. I dont know what is wrong now. Your webgui is working but shows that my torrents are stopped. I&#039;m able to upload a torrent and it starts downloading the torrent. I can see via ssh that ctorrent uses CPU time and is actually downloading the torrent but I&#039;m getting no feedback from the webgui. There is written that the status of my torrent is Stopped. </p><p>Here is my output:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Mar 24 16:30:43 AsusP daemon.debug dctcs: stat file read

					<p>the problem is that something is running on the clinet-port (netstat can help you if you dont know what is it) so you can stop that or you can change the setting:<br />client-host=localhost:15000<br />in dctcs.conf</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok anothe problem occured, torrents are aded via YODCTCS webpage correctly, they are starting and writing properly. BUT...<br />After some time of working router stops responding, webpages doesnt load on my pc, router doesnt respond on pings, ssh ir ftp requests. When I check status of my connection and it shows that speed of my connection dropped to 1Mb/s. Before that router is downloading torrents with average speed of about 400-500kB. This is way lower than my connection speed as on PC i Download files with speed up to 1.8mB, I understant that i wont receive such speeds and I will be satisfied with about 500-700kB so its ok, but I cant reboot device manually every 30-40minutes.<br />If any logs would be needed please give me step by step ionstructions as I am beginner with linux <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I use asus wl500gP device with 7.09 kamikaze installed with ctorrent from kamikaze repository and download torrents to USB drive.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,<br />I installed dctcs (really great gui), made all necessary configuration in dctcs.conf and i ran into the following problem (as I saw it was discussed earlier but i didn&#039;t find an answer). If I upload a torrent file through gui or I copy the file through samba, dctcs recognize the torrent but is unable to start the torrent.<br />On the other hand, if i start the torrent manually <br />ctorrent -s filename torrent_file -S localhost:15000<br />the torrent starts , is visible in dctcs and can be controlled by web gui. In this case I can pause/stop/start it without any problems.<br />Do you have any idea why I cannot start a torrent directly from gui ?<br />I have an Asus WL500g preminum, kamikaze 7.09 (kernel 2.4 - squashfs), and using a 100GB USB HDD (2 partitions: 1-swap 500MB, 2-ext3 partition), all packages installed to root.<br />Please help!<br />Kind regards,<br />Ibrahim</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ibrahim</strong> on 26 Aug 2008, 13:03)</p>
