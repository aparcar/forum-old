					<p>Hi ianchi, <br/>Thanks for soft float image but i will be able to test the new image in 10 days, now I do not have physical access to the router.<br/>Currently, the router is stable (2 days uptime) on your hard float image. Radios 2.4&amp;5G performance and range are great , better than on WRT1900ACv1.<br/>I think EA8500 is now one of the best routers in openwrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the update.</p><p>I tried sysupgrade, failed miserably. Also should note that the recovery is now /sbin/sysrevert, since I had to go to the git to figure out where that script was.

					<p>Hi @Konikofi.<br/>It should be working OK over 168206. <br/>Where you able to flash original 1.1.4.168206? If you are not on that version, and you have an US router, that might be the problem.</p><p>If you are on 168206, then It&#039;s long since I did a factory upgrade, and maybe some latter changes have caused trouble. </p><p>Have you tried with the firmware from post #2?, (the one that is hosted in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fr5wma9xfsuy6kg/AACYKZFSNAY84c2vDIemBCPBa?dl=0">this dropbox</a>).</p><p>Please, confirm and I will have a look into it as soon as I have some time this week.</p>									</div>
