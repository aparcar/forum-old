					<p>I use split networks at home and therefore broke the br0 device. As I want dhcp on lan and wifi interface I played around with S50dnsmasq. I simply copied it to S51dnsmasq and changed iface=wifi which did not work, some obscure <br />&quot;dnsmasq: failed to bind listening socket: Address already in use&quot;</p><p>I finally found out that dnsmasq per default binds to lo (for whatever reaseon).<br />By excluding lo (via -I) and explicitely only binding to given iface one is able to start more than one dnsmasq instance (also chaning lease file name).</p><p>One only needs to modify the args like this:</p><p> args=&quot;-Z -l /tmp/dhcp.${ifname}.leases -K -F $(int2ip $start),$(int2ip $end),$(int2ip $netmask),12h -z -i ${ifname} -I lo&quot;</p><p>I propose changing /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq as it seems to break nothing and enables dhcp in split network situations.</p><p>P.S.: This is my try to contact openwrt.org developers, so please be gentle if i violated etiquette.</p><p>regards<br />roland lezuo</p>									</div>
