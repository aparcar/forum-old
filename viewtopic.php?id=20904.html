					<p>Please follow my steps and offer a suggestion as to where I went wrong.</p><p>Saw a friend with the x-wrt interface and had to have it. Ordered a new wrt54gl router. Consulted openwrt documentation and determined that a pre built image was for me. Saw &quot;supported&quot; under the hardware listing so I naturally went for whiterussian openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin based on the definition of &quot;supported.</p><p>Downloaded this to my only working computer at the time, a macbook pro. Used the safari browser to navigate to the linksys web interface and selected the openwrt/x-wrt image and began the upload process. In a few minutes I had a window telling me that the upload failed. </p><p>I unplugged everything and set up again only to get the exact same results. </p><p>On the third try I was connecting a friends windows based computer when I noticed the power led was flashing and I could not telnet, ssh nor navigate to the router by any means mentioned here. </p><p>Can anyone tell me what I did wrong? I spent all morning consulting the docs and can not easily determine this myself.</p><p>Thanks in advance<br />quotaholic</p>									</div>
