					<p><strong>wrt99</strong>, you are welcome.<br />Yes, in console of router. Please, specify exact model of your router. Which commands does original firmware have? Please, run following commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>help
uname</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>What model of router?&nbsp; If it can run OpenWrt you should do that rather than try to rewrite the manufacturer&#039;s firmware.&nbsp; If it is a cable or DSL combo modem-router you can use it only as a modem and do all your routing and wifi with another box running OpenWrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 13 Apr 2017, 18:10)</p>
