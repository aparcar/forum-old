					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve a LinkSys router connected to my ISP, it is a standard router with factory firmware.</p><p>A TP841ND running OpenWrt is wired to it (LAN port on Lis inkSys, WAN port on TPLink). </p><p>The LinkSys manages the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, it&#039;s own address 192.168.1.1 acts as both the gateway and dns server for the LAN.</p><p>The TP841ND manages the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet, on it&#039;s WAN side has a static address assigned 192.168.1.3 on the LAN side it&#039;s a gateway 192.168.2.1. Default gateway is 192.168.1.1.</p><p>With this configuration all clients on the TP841ND LAN can navigate between them, access any machine on the LinkSys LAN and navigate the Internet without probles.</p><p>The LinkSys WAN side can be accessed thru a hostname by means of a dynamic dns setup which means the IP address of its WAN port can be known at any moment. Let&#039;s say on a given moment is 190.191.100.120.</p><p>The LinkSys defines as it&#039;s DMZ the static IP Address of the TP841ND router; all traffic then is routed there. </p><p>With port forwarding the TP841ND bounces some ports to other machines in the LinkSys LAN or keeps for itself some traffic (i.e. SSH access or Web browser with LUCI).</p><p>So I can access designated machines in both LAN from anywhere.</p><p>Firewall is setup at the router TP841ND wide open, accepting traffic to/from both the WAN and LAN ports.</p><p>I&#039;ve a mirror setup somewhere else, it can be accessed thru the external IP 190.200.100.222, their LinkSys LAN is&nbsp; identical (192.168.1.0/24) and their TP741ND LAN is 192.168.3.0/24</p><p>I want to access from the LAN on the the TP841ND&nbsp; the resources on the LAN of the other TP841ND thru an ipip tunnel.</p><p>Defined in LAN &quot;A&quot; (192.168.2.0/24)</p><p>iptunnel add tunl1 mode ipip remote 190.200.100.222 local 192.168.2.1<br />ifconfig tunl1 up<br />route add -net 192.168.3.0/24 dev tunl1</p><p>and in the LAN &quot;B&quot; (192.168.3.0/24)</p><p>iptunnel add tunl1 mode ipip remote 190.191.100.120 local 192.168.3.1<br />ifconfig tunl1 up<br />route add -net 192.168.2.0/24 dev tunl1</p><p>Using tcpdump I can see that if ping 192.168.3.1 is given in LAN &quot;A&quot; it&#039;s being routed thru tunl1 and ditto in the<br />opposite direction when ping 192.168.2.1 is made in LAN &quot;B&quot;.<br />&nbsp; <br />The configuration doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>Any idea on why?<br />Additional setups needed?<br />Is it expected to work a ipip tunnel protocol with NAT involved?<br />Firewalling?<br />Other approach suggested?</p><p>Thanks, Pedro</p>									</div>
