					<p>Has anyone had any luck getting the vpnc package to run on a 2.6 kernel.&nbsp; Both 0.4.x and 0.5.x work great on broadcom 2.4.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to use 0.5 on the broadcom 2.6 08.09 RC1 and I am having problems.&nbsp; The tunnel comes up, but if I do anything to the tunnel like add a route or send a ping either the kernel crashes or the tunnel disconnects.</p>									</div>
