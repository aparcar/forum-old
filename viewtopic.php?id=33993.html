					<p>Hi,</p><p>This is my first post in the forum, so I hope this is the right place and a valid question.</p><p>I am wondering what the difference in capabilities might be between the WR703N and MR11U, apart from the obvious battery difference meaning the MR11U can run for up to 5 hours without power.</p><p>Cheers, The Captn</p>									</div>

					<p>they essentially have the same hardware other than the battery part.you can flash firmware for 703N onto MR11U without any problem or the other way around. you can will get no more than 5 hours battery life if you use it as 3g router and download data continuously. but the battery can last much longer than 5 hours with normal usage. telling frome experience, the battery didn&#039;t die out after around 8 hours&nbsp; in repeater mode,</p>									</div>
