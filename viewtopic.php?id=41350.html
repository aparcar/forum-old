					<p>Hi everyone,<br />I&#039;m trying to install OpenWRT onto an Asus WL-330N. I followed this guide <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl-330n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl-330n</a> and managed to compile a fitting bin with the name &quot;openwrt-ramips-rt305x-wl-330n-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot;.<br />Since I don&#039;t want to open the device, I&#039;m trying to install via recovery mode. The only way it seems to accept the image is when I rename the bin-file to a trx-name that Asus would choose for their updates like WL-330N3G_1.0.2.0.trx. If I strip down the first 32 bytes it does not seem to flash and when I pull the power cable after 10 minutes and put it back in, the Asus firmware is still there.<br />If I do not remove the first 32 bytes from the bin-file, rename it and upload it, it seems to get flashed and reboots.<br />I cannot log in, though. <br />I&#039;ve tried to login via telnet and via web acess trying. I&#039;ve tried multiple ip configurations for my computer: <br />static 192.168.1.20<br />static 192.168.1.101<br />static 192.168.1.120<br />dhcp -&gt; Windows does not find a dhcp server and sets APIPA address</p><p>When monitoring the traffic on the ethernet cable all I see is one single DHCP Discover Request from the access point.</p><p>Any ideas what I&#039;m doing wrong? I really don&#039;t know what else to do.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think that in openwrt default configuration your device have RJ-45 port as WAN port (with dhcp client) and WIFI switched off. You can use openwrt <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">failsafe mode</a> to up wifi interface or change switch configuration (set RJ-45 as LAN port) and rebuild firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dont know if this is solved, but you can do it this way -</p><p>Put the device in recovery mode by pressing and holding down the &#039;restore&#039; button on the bottom or the &#039;WPS&#039; bottom on the top of the device as you plug in the power supply, press &amp; hold until the power button light starts flashing slowly, like once every 3 -5 secs. </p><p>Once its starts flashing, it will stay like that for a while, so now plug in the ethernet cable into the device and then into your laptop or desktop ethernet port, then change the ip address of the &#039;local area network&#039; adapter&#039;s &#039;TCP/IPv4&#039; to a static address as below: </p><p>ip address:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.20<br />subnet mask: 255.255.255.0</p><p>...leave the others setting ie. gateway &amp; dns blank.</p><br /><p>Then use the Asus &#039;Firmware Restoration&#039; app (I have the WL-330N3G so i have the one for it, but i believe it should work for the WL-330N, you can find it here - <a href="http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-330N3G/UT_WL_330N3G_4258.zip">http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wirele â€¦ G_4258.zip</a>) to flash the bin file (the app will protest about the file not being a Asus firmware file as expected, just click &#039;yes&#039;), let it finish uploading and it will then flash and the device will eventually restart after all is done.</p><p>Once the restart is done (the power light will eventually stop flashing), you can then change &#039;local area network&#039; adapter&#039;s &#039;TCP/IPv4&#039; back to obtain ip automatically and once it assigns an ip to the device, you can then log in via LuCi or SSH or SCP, however you must first set a password either via telnet or via LuCi if it is included in the bin.</p><p>Note: You can also use the above app to flash a ASUS firmware image file (.trx) as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>des245</strong> on 28 Feb 2013, 22:15)</p>
