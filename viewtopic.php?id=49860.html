					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am new to OpenWrt build environment.</p><p>I am creating custom package for TP-Link WDR4300 based on attitude_adjustment.</p><p>I am using functions from other package (libnetfilter queue) in my package.<br />compilation goes through fine. But in linking stage build crashes. Obviously linker is not able to find those references.</p><p>I have defined &quot;DEPENDS:=+libnetfilter_queue&quot; in the Makefile available in the packages directory. Build still crashes.</p><p>I am not clear with how to define the dependencies.</p><p>what modifications are required in the Makefile (src directory).</p><p>My current Makefile (src directory) is very simple. It looks like this.</p><p>CC = gcc<br />CFLAGS = -Wall<br />OBJS = main.o</p><p>all: smartAP</p><p>%.o: %.c<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $&lt;</p><p>smartAP: $(OBJS)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; $(CC) -o $@ $(OBJS)</p><p>clean:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rm -f smartAP *.o</p><p>Please let me know how to include the dependencies on other packages, so that build goes through.</p>									</div>

					<p>To me it looks like you are using the wrong compiler in the src Makefile. You are using the generic gcc, while you should use the Openwrt cross-compile-gcc for your platform.<br />The CC definition is probably wrong and extra. You should let the Openwrt make system provide that definition for you automatically in the background.</p><p>You might looks a similar example here:<br />px5g main Makefile: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/utils/px5g-standalone/Makefile">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/p … e/Makefile</a><br />src Makefile: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/utils/px5g-standalone/src/Makefile">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/p … c/Makefile</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 2 Apr 2014, 23:04)</p>

					<p>Hi hnyman,</p><p>Thank you for the quick response. I have seen the build output using V=s option in make. CC macro, what I have defined is overridden by openwrt build system and proper cross compiler is used.<br />I had look at the src make file for px5g.<br />px5g does not have any dependencies on other packages.</p><p>My package has dependency on libnetfilter_queue. Linker needs the definition/declaration of function calls from libnetfilter_queue.</p><p>According to my understanding, somehow this information needs to be put into src makefile. So that build goes through.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi devnet,</p><p>I dug this up when searching for a solution to the same problem. I found that the problem was that the package should not be &quot;+libnetfilter_queue&quot; but instead actually &quot;+libnetfilter-queue&quot; .
