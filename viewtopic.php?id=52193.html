					<p>I&#039;m successfully tried multiple wifi on MR11U and MR13U. They should have the same chipset.<br />Important to know is, that if the network &quot;flet&quot; is not available, the whole wifi will crash. At least it is in that way on my router. So I would suggest that you connect via eth0, configure &quot;flet&quot; first and then add the accesspoint.</p>									</div>

At work i only need nokia_hotspot which is bridge thru my lan connection to get internet only. However with the flet in not connected state, nokia_hotspot also not working. The solution is to remove flet then nokia_hotspot will work. Why like this ? openwrt bug or tplink bug ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Your mode is&nbsp; &#039;sta&#039; (client mode) and &#039;ap&#039; (access point mode). If you active 2 mode this way, the router will try to connect flet (client). If the flet connection is successful, then &#039;nokia_hotspot&#039; will active. If connection not success, AP will not active.<br />That&#039;s the restriction as far as I know but may be other smart way to teach router as you need. I think if none easier solution, you can make your own switch script to command your router to switch wireless configs. The script will operate along with 3 states switch (sliding switch on side of router) which you may need to take a time to learn how to do it.</p>									</div>
