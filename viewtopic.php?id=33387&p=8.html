If you have made local changes to pulseaudio configuration you need to comment them out in the file ~/.pulse/client.conf (if this file does exists). Secondly from your ubuntu pc make sure you can access WR703N using name otherwise you will need to use ip address instead (in the /etc/pulse/client.conf)</p><p>You can try the following from command line on your ubuntu pc<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>pactl list sinks</code></pre></div><p>if you can see the #0 sink name as card0 then it&#039;s working for you.

It&#039;s bloody annoying when the audio stops every time you or your neighbour uses the microwave!</p>									</div>

					<p>hi, <br />any progress on the extra-root thing? i would like to use mpd installed on a usb stick attached to a hub on a 703n, with the pulseaudio firmware. I have managed to compile libfaad with fixed point so now i can listen to some radio broadcasts in AAC (320kbps). <br />Also, do you have some patches of your own i would have to use if i wanted to build pulseaudio as a package? i have a 1043n already and i have seen some failed attempts to build it.<br />Great Work!
