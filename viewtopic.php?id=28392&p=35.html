					<p>has anybody here established a successful ipsec vpn using the trunk build? I&#039;ve installed the official trunk build on my router and can connect to vpn but only see the device. I can not access the lan or internet. I had it working with AA build so I don&#039;t think it is firewall issue. I read somewhere that there is an issue with the ipsec-tools that doesn&#039;t forward the ipsec packets. Anybody knows about this issue? <br/>appreciate your help</p>									</div>

There are still kernel version checks against minor 2.6.x revisions, which is rather weird. Similarly, when googling for &quot;netfilter layer7&quot; etc., the found items mostly reference to kernel 2.4 and 2.6. So, I am not quite sure if the underlying code is supposed to work with the current kernels. Nobody has probably really checked that it works with the current 3.10+ kernels. The patches proposed in the Openwrt bug have also raised negative comments. They might require major overhaul. I don&#039;t need the functionality, so I have no intention to use time for that.</p>									</div>

My build has natively neither gw6c nor radvd, which has been superseded first by 6relayd and then by odhcpd (which is included in the build). You might have double ra/dhcpv6 services in LAN, if both odhcpd and radvd are active. </p><p>First guess is that your PC only gets a link-local ipv6 address and not a public ipv6 address. Probably due to misconfiguration of radvd or odhcpd.</p><p>As your config is rather exotic (gw6c and radvd), you should maybe open a separate own thread for specific questions, as otherwise you might not get advice from the people knowing about those, (and I don&#039;t want this thread to degenerate into a generic help thread, which is what happened to Arokh&#039;s.)</p>									</div>
