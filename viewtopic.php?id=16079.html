					<p>It has been quite a while since OpenWrt had a new Kamikaze release. The <br />developer team has decided that it is time to get things straight and <br />focus on a new release. This release have the official name: OpenWrt <br />Kamikaze 808 Release.</p><p>The schedule will look like this:</p><p>*Last day in July - final release candidate: 808 RC-1<br />808 RC-1 will be a feature freeze, and all changes after this point will <br />be bug fixes.</p><p>*Last day in August - final release: OpenWrt Kamikaze 808 Release.</p><p>OpenWrt Kamikaze 808 Release will focus on bringing the following:</p><p>- Firewall rewrite<br />- Broadcom 47xx running reliably with the new Kernel, not including wifi<br />- IMQ and Traffic shaping tested with newer kernels, especially 2.6.25<br />- Sysupgrade for more platforms (x86 is tested again)<br />- The new web interface (LuCI, Lua Configuration Interface)<br />- Attention towards the integration of security updates<br />- Package maintaining and updates between releases <br />- Testing, testing and lots of testing...</p><p>The 808 Release will also include support for several new platforms/targets.</p><p>Added to this there will be a need to discuss, and find solutions towards, <br />how best to solve the &#039;patch submission process&#039;, work on updating the existing <br />Kamikaze documentation - and finally anyone should feel free to comment and <br />suggest.</p><p>It is the hope of the OpenWrt developer-group that all users and members <br />in one way or other will take part in the practical work which will lead <br />to the OpenWrt Kamikaze Release 808.</p><p>WIP-Day in June, July and August will focus on the upcoming 808 Release, <br />so join #openwrt-devel at UTC 12:00 on the last saturday in the <br />following months.</p><p>Sincerely<br />and on behalf of the</p><p>The OpenWrt Team</p>									</div>

					<p>LuCI and X-Wrt are closely related to each other, and in this way not competitors. There is an overlap between the people work on these webif&#039;s - and it is the intention that LuCI will become the base/default webif&nbsp; framework for OpenWrt Kamikaze.<br />:-)</p>									</div>
