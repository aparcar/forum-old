					<p>Dear all,<br />i&#039;m using a ramips (rt5350) platform (HLK-RM04, but i changed the SDRAM from 16MB to 32MB, and config the kernel with force 32MB).</p><p>now i configured the luci and could connect it via wifi (but lan and wan not work, may be hardware problem, i didn&#039;t check it carefully because wireless connection was available.</p><p>i could scan wifi using putty via ttys1. but i can&#039;t scaned wifi via the web configureation.<br />the network-&gt;wifi-&gt;scan can&#039;t find any result. the list was empty. it&#039;s a bug or still onging? i see the HLK-RM04 platform are still ongoing for fully support.</p><p>the info get from the 192.168.1.1 was:<br />firmware Version OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r40498 /LuCI Trunk(svn-r9964).</p><p>Kernel Version 3.10.36</p><p>Can anybody could give me some advise?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have the same problem using Attitude Adjustment r41581, i.e. clicking SCAN button does not show any Access Point even though WIFI scanning works fine using LUCI-JSON or SSH. </p><p>I know Attitude Adjustment r36469 or earlier running on RAMIPS is able to scan via LUCI web interface but has not been able to do so since the BB WIFI driver backports.</p><p>Using Attitude Adjustment r36469, you can only do WIFI scan when you are connected from ethernet. Any attempts to initiate WIFI scan when you are connected from WIFI will result in immediate disconnection and you will need to reboot the router to fix it.</p><p>RAMIPS WIFI driver was broken several times and subsequently fixed, see this ticket for details.<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13532">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13532</a></p><p>I believe it is one of the changes in r36470 or subsequent BB WIFI driver backport changes that resulted in this behaviour.<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/36470">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/36470</a></p><p>Testing done on other platform does not suffer from this bug, indicating this bug is likely RAMIPS specific.</p><p>Update: <br />LUCI scan button works on RAMIPS if the WIFI radio is disabled first.<br />I have verified this on my rt5350 and rt3052 hardware.</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#039;t let you scan with a single wifi virtual interface in AP mode while it is enabled. It has nothing to do with the driver.&quot;<br /><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2013-September/021483.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope â€¦ 21483.html</a></p><p>Given the fact that I can conduct WIFI scan using both SSH (iwlist scan) and JSON.<br />This sounds like an artificial restriction somewhere in LUCI.. Anyone have any idea where the code for this restriction is located or how to lift this restriction??</p><p>I have also tried to build the same ROM for TP-link TL-WR1043ND v1 and there is no such problem/behaviour there. This means I am pretty certain that this behaviour is related to RAMIPS.</p><p>Related tickets<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13171">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13171</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16348">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/16348</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15460">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/15460</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ericwongcm</strong> on 1 Aug 2014, 15:17)</p>
