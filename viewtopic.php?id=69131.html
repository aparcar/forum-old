					<p>Hello, i want to mount an usb pendrive but the router is not recognizing it. I got the Archer C7 AC1750 v2 with the gd25q128 flash chip, so i had to install OpenWrt with a kernel module and ath10k firmware, it has the 3.18.29 Kernel. I think that&#039;s could be the reason why, because when i try to install the kmod-usb-storage i get this message :<br />* satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-usb-storage:<br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.18.23-1-b2f200610f46d20ef52d269421369d0c) *<br />* opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmos-usb-storage.<br />Any Ideas how to make usb work? Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>When you use snapshot builds, you&#039;ll have to get all the kmods you&#039;re going to need on the same day you downloaded the image.&nbsp; If you need another one later you&#039;ll have to upgrade your entire firmware to that day&#039;s build and reinstall all your kmods and packages.</p><p>You could also download the entire packages tree (especially the kmods) along with the image and keep a local copy that matches your build.&nbsp; Then you set up a small web server on your PC and point the /etc/opkg/sources configuration to it, so when you add a package later it gets it from your collection rather than the ones on the server which may no longer match.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 29 Dec 2016, 18:07)</p>
