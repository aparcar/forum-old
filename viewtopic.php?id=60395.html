					<p>That path looks strange. Is it correct?<br />I didn&#039;t get from your path, which component you are actually patching.</p><p>In general, you place the patch among the other patches for that tool, toolchain component or package.</p><p>E.g. for gcc 4.8 it is toolchain/gcc/patches/4.8-linaro: <a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=tree;f=toolchain/gcc/patches/4.8-linaro;hb=HEAD">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a … ro;hb=HEAD</a></p><p>for Linux itself you should place platform-independent patches in target/linux/generic/patches-4.1/&nbsp; (depending on the linux version your platform uses), and platform-specific patches in platform&#039;s patch folder (e.g. target/linux/x86/patches-3.18/&nbsp; )</p><p>And e.g. for opkg package it would be package/system/opkg/patches/</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 19 Oct 2015, 18:30)</p>

					<p>oh ok.. thanks. so you believe that its getting copied from kernel include? if so just creating the patch in the folder as u said will help me..&nbsp; let me give a try creating patch in folder u mentioned.. </p><p>&quot;toolchain-i386_i486_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2&quot; folder name would changes based on the platform. I was checking the makefile in toochain folder.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt; so you believe that its getting copied from kernel include? <br />I am actually not quite sure. The location is so strange that it might be the buildhost&#039;s linux source headers, too. And I don&#039;t think that they are patched at any stage.</p><p>What are you actually trying to do by your patch? <br /> - modify some tool used when building the firmware?<br /> - modify a component in the final firmware?</p><p>If it is about something in the final firmware, the workflow with the kernel sources for the actual firmware is roughly this:<br />1) kernel sources are extracted from the source.tar.gz to build_dir/target-*/linux-*<br />2) generic patches from target/linux/generic/patches-3.18/ are appplied with quilt<br />3) platform patches are applied from target/linux/x86/patches-3.18/ are applied with quilt</p><p>(staging_dir is just temp stuff, nothing there is permanent)</p>									</div>
