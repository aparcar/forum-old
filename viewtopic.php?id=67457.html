					<p>Hello expert,</p><p>I got question about installing OpenWRT onto my Aztech HW550-3G wireless router. I successfully installed it via normal upgrading method by uploading the OpenWRT image via existing (original) web firmware upgrading section. It replaced my original firmware and it boot up successfully. The first thing I noticed that the new OpenWRT gave an alert the device&#039;s disk space is full. I configured and saved the configuration but lost when it (the device) rebooted. </p><p>How to fix this?</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>Alex</p>									</div>
