					<p>I have used the Buffalo WHR-G54S and Linksys WRT54G in some pretty extreme heat.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had the Linksys running in an Attic for two summers now and the Buffalo for one summer.&nbsp; The attics reach approximately 120 °F (49 °C); well above their rated temperature.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I also have the buffalo in Rootenna boxes since last fall.&nbsp; &nbsp; Again no problems.&nbsp; In the Rootenna, I take them out of their plastic shell for better air flow.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t measured the temps, but last winter we saw some nights below 8 °F (-13 °C).</p><p>These consumer routers seem to do better will with heat and cold than their ratings suggest.&nbsp; Probably because of their low power consumption.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I&#039;ll be putting some Meraki Minis to the test this summer in Rootennas.</p>									</div>
