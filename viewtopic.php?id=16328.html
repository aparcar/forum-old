					<p>I know there are a few people here running openwrt on their routers and running Dovecot and Xmail.&nbsp; I had a real hard time finding information on authenticating Dovecot users against Xmail&#039;s user database.&nbsp; In the end I hacked together a script to do the authentication.&nbsp; It&#039;s not pretty and I don&#039;t claim to know what I&quot;m doing, but I thought I&#039;d post it for anyone else that might be interested.&nbsp; Comments and criticism to improve this script would be very welcome.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# This file is the pre-cursor to checkpassword-reply.  It is called by Dovecot
# with the location of checkpassword-reply as an argument (in $1).  To use it,
# you must enter the location of this script as an argument to a passdb
# checkpassword block in /etc/dovecot.conf:

#  passdb checkpassword {
#    args = /path/to/this_script
# It may also be possible to pass the domain as an argument
# to this script by instead using
#    args = /path/to/this_script %d
#  }

#    args = uid=vxmail gid=vxmail home=/path/to/MailRoot/domains/%d/%n
