					<p>Someone managed to use a serial port as a very simple PWM DAC.<br /><a href="http://vivara.net.nyud.net:8090/blog/?p=24">http://vivara.net.nyud.net:8090/blog/?p=24</a><br />Instead of tying up a serial port, could it be possible to &quot;bit bang&quot; a GPIO to do the same? A very simple transistor switch can handle the speaker driving or a resistored piezo speaker could be used. The GPIO can even be shared with, for example, a LED.<br />BTW, don&#039;t expect good quality (although it will likely be higher than the serial port due to higher frequencies and lack of start and stop bits), but it should work nicely for simple sound effects. (Imagine if you set up your router to check all the servers and say &quot;Fault detected on server x.&quot;&nbsp; if it finds a problem. Or if the router is part of a homemade robot...)</p>									</div>

					<p>star582, you need some hardware that can buffer the data since you can not interrupt often enough to do this.</p><p>I know the parent post is old but I am currently working on using an FPGA with a character driver that uses the GPIO to send data to the FPGA every 1/10 of a second (interrupt is triggered by buffer size).&nbsp; An FPGA is necessary so that its RAM can be used for the buffer, it then uses Pulse Density Modulation that is derived from a digital sigma-delta converter inside the FPGA.&nbsp; I am attempting to make the logic synchronous because the serial port is too slow and asynchronous logic is a pain to simulate and debug.&nbsp; So my design will have to synthesize to 166 MHz (I believe thats what the WRT54G runs at).&nbsp; Since this design requires no add/mult or any other nasty logic, I don&#039;t think this will be a problem.</p><p>Using the serial port results in crummy audio quality, unless I use a CPLD with a MP3 decoder chip.</p><p>The total hardware cost including PCB, FPGA, and Config PROM will be less than $15 hopefully.&nbsp; </p><p>If anyone would like to contact me with suggestions, help, or enthusiasm you can email me at lm317t ATT gmail GDOT com&nbsp; minus ATT and GDOT</p><p>Thanks<br />Brian</p>									</div>
