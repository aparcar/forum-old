					<p>I&#039;d like to buy a 4G router with an integrated battery that can also be used to run a couple cron jobs and small HTTP services, I&#039;d need around 500MB RAM and a halfway decent processor. Basically the GL-Mifi, but with better performance. Does anyone know something like that? External USB Modems are not an option unless they fit inside the case and don&#039;t stick out.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jgillich</strong> on 4 Nov 2016, 17:27)</p>

					<p>It doesn&#039;t have 4G, or does it? Also seems way too overpowered, I have no use for a gazillion LAN ports, I just want to connect 2-3 devices via wifi.</p>									</div>

					<p>There are extremely slim pickings in the device class you want.&nbsp; </p><p>The only currently produced 3g/4g device with a battery that I know of is the GLi MIFI.</p><p>The Turris Omnia and the PC_Engines APU2 (<a href="http://pcengines.ch/pdf/apu2.pdf">http://pcengines.ch/pdf/apu2.pdf</a>) both have sim card slots on the MOBO, but neither a battery or portable.&nbsp; The APU is 12V, the Turris is not speced.&nbsp; Both will require a PCI-E card. like the MIFI.</p><p>The amount of RAM you want is excessive for a consumer router&#039;s typical tasks. You are really looking for a business class device that has a 4G backup to get more horse power.</p><p>Do you need RAM or can you use external storage?</p>									</div>

					<p>I used to run a APU1 as my router/home server, but I&#039;m going to be traveling long-term so I want a always-on device that also serves as a 4G router. The GL-Mifi is great, but with its 64MB RAM there won&#039;t be much room to do anything with it other than routing. But there&#039;s no reason I could not just use a VPS instead, other than wanting full control over the device, not sure how much sense that makes to anyone else but me...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jgillich</strong> on 4 Nov 2016, 18:33)</p>

					<p>@zlmnet.&nbsp; If you are the vendor please take the time to add this device (Upright Ming F8) to the OpenWrt table of hardware and begin a WIKI page for it with relevant info.&nbsp; Also please forward appropriate patches to OpenWrt and LEDE groups to have the device supported going forward in regular builds.&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a></p><p>Here is a link in the above to add to the ToH, but you will need to signup for the WIKI (as opposed to the forum)<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/adding_to_toh">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/adding_to_toh</a></p><p>There is also an expectation, for at least this post, that if you say 4G, that this is internal to the device and not an external 4g USB device.&nbsp; This is not clear from the website.&nbsp; Is there an English version?

					<p>FWIW I&#039;ve ordered a NEXX WT3020F for $10 that I&#039;ll hook up with a USB modem and a USB battery, will do for now until something better comes along. I don&#039;t quite get why a simple 4G router like the GL-MIFI costs twice as much as a much more powerful phone..probably because the market for phones is much bigger, but still. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>									</div>

					<p>A big cost of the GLI is the PCI-e modem card ($50).&nbsp; These are a rare low volume product as compared to a USB modem and there for are expensive.&nbsp; If you shop the Sierra Wireless cards they are 2-3 times the price, but do cover more bands.</p><p>With out the card the device is competitive with most of the other battery powered routers.&nbsp; Hootoo a little less, Kingston a bit more.</p>									</div>
