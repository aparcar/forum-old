					<p>I didn&#039;t find any implementations of this package and was interested in testing out use cases, so I have a crude initial package available.</p><p>Info on the package and a few suggested use models:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Tarsnap/spiped">https://github.com/Tarsnap/spiped</a></p><p>The git repo for the beta:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/InkblotAdmirer/custom_feed">https://github.com/InkblotAdmirer/custom_feed</a></p><p>Some notes on the config/init are in the README so I won&#039;t duplicate here.</p><p>If anyone wants to pick it up and maintain it, go for it.&nbsp; If it gets interest and turns into something that should be available in the package feeds I may step up.</p><p>Note that this information was originally shared in the developer&#039;s corner but since it turned into an actual package I figured it would get more opportunity for sharing here.&nbsp; I&#039;m blown away that it hasn&#039;t already been packaged:&nbsp; encryption + authentication and simple use model.</p>									</div>
