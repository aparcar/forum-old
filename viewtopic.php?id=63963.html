					<p>&gt;something goes wrong on unit 576, two things are needed: we need to know about it before the client/end user does and secondly we need to fix the problem.&lt;<br />First can be implemeneted using a watchdog. Second depends upon reason of failure. An auto soft reboot might suffice.<br />For remote config management for the openwrt-box I only know (and implemented) &quot;Do it Yourself&quot; solutions.<br />&gt;Mixed with RADIUSdesk, one should be able to configure individual user profiles grouped into RADIUS realms. &lt;<br />This is a special AAA issue. Not particularly for openwrt only; you might need coova-chilli for the hotpspot-AP, for example, as it contains radius interface. Or you use mikrotiks, but not very flexible regarding hotspot functionality :-)</p><br /><p> I suspect, you will have to consider a customized solution for your requirements.</p>									</div>
