					<p>Hey! I have been searching this topic in forums but did not see anything useful for my situation.</p><p>The problem:</p><p>I have been using OpenWRT on my WDR3500 for quite a while but decided to switch back to its factory firmware. But I have accidentally installed firmware from WDR3600 (using unsafe installation - my bad. I blame myself for that). Everything works fine but small detail - my LANs and WAN are now dead. WiFi is working perfectly though.</p><p>Unfortunately every solution I found requires usage of LAN ports. The only thing I can do is to visit the router&#039;s admin page, go to &quot;update firmware&quot; menu and to upload the new version of WDR3600 firmware. But it accepts only firmwares for WDR3600 as router thinks it is WDR3600.</p><p>Is there any way to fix that problem without LANs? May be feed router the WDR3500 firmware with some kind of tweak that will make it to think that it is a WDR3600 firmware?</p><p>Big-big thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have never had this problem so don&#039;t have a definite answer. The wdr3500 has only 100Mb ethernet ports where the wdr3600 has 1000Mb so the hardware is different.</p><p>If you were able to &#039;sysupgrade&#039; the wdr3600 firmware in the menu then did you also try to install the wdr3500 initial openwrt &#039;factory&#039; condition firmware in the menu? Just curious.</p><p>Did you try to install the wdr3500 &#039;factory&#039; firmware with the command line? Just curious.</p><p>Either of those above might possibly make things worse because I don&#039;t really know. A safer approach might be to restore the original TP-link firmware. You should be able to transfer the file with scp and restore with ssh on the command line or maybe the menu all over the wifi. Be sure to remove the bootloader from the TP-link firmware. I have never needed to do this uninstall so good luck. The proceedure is given in the wiki:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3500</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I would back the screws out and put a serial cable on it and reflash thru the bootloader, because anything else is too much messing around.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t equipped to do that, consider:</p><p>Open the 3500 stock firmware with a hex editor and look in the header (the first couple hundred bytes) for something obvious like &#039;3500&#039; that you could change to 3600 like you were thinking.&nbsp; You will probably need to regenerate the CRC then to make it look like a valid firmware.&nbsp; There is a neat project on Google Code called &quot;firmware_mod_kit&quot; which can do that.</p><p>Turn router on with an Ethernet cable plugged into one of the LAN ports and notice if the LAN light for that port comes on within a few seconds of power up.&nbsp; If it does come on (only to go out later after the 3600 firmware boots), the bootloader is probably capable of accepting a telnet or tftp connection.&nbsp; Specifics on how to do that are likely written up somewhere on the web.</p>									</div>
