					<p>I have installed OpenWrt on my TP-LINK TP-WA801ND Access Point. I believe this one only has 4 MB of flash so I decided to remove all firewall related packages (firewall and iptables) because I don&#039;t need them and I thought it may speed up the performance of the AP.</p><p>After I tried to delete kmod-ip6tables something went wrong. I now get the following message on the packages page (I&#039;m using LuCI):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:448: Failed to execute call dispatcher target for entry &#039;/admin/system/packages&#039;.
The called action terminated with an exception:

					<p>Squashfs is a read-only file system. By removing stuff you just hide them (which actually decreases the amount of free space instead of increasing it). If you want to make a lighter firmware, you need to compile it yourself.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thank both of you very much.</p><p>I know it won&#039;t save space then, I&#039;m trying to build my own firmware (based on 14.07 instead of 12.09) now but it takes time because the patch is for 12.09 and I can&#039;t seem to find where to remove packages except for dnsmasq.</p><p>In the meantime at least dnsmasq should be disabled.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it&#039;s easier to use OpenWrt image generator instead of compiling.&nbsp; The Image generator allows you to install your needed packages only and package the whole thing into squashfs which use less space.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtai â€¦ e.generate</a></p>									</div>
