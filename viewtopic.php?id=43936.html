					<p>I have a NETGEAR WNDR3700 that I just installed Attitude Adjustment 12.09 on and I can&#039;t get port forwarding to my Windows 7 box on port 1723 to work for PPTP VPN. It worked fine before with the stock firmware.</p><p>I&#039;ve gone into the firewall and added a port forward for port 1723 to my box, and one for 3389 (RDP). The one for RDP works fine, but the one for the VPN just doesn&#039;t seem to want to connect through the WAN. I can connect via wireless or LAN ok.</p><p>I&#039;ve removed all the VLAN config, but otherwise the system is at default. I tried changing the zone settings to allow the WAN to forward to the LAN and vice versa but that didn&#039;t seem to help.</p><p>How do I get the port forwarding to work for VPN?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a guess, add following rules to firewall.user:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Allow forwarding from/to VPN interface
iptables -A forwarding_rule -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A forwarding_rule -o ppp+ -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div>									</div>
