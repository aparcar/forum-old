					<p>I&#039;m about to give up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m having a problem with getting wireless set up on my WRT54GS V1.1 and Kamikaze 7.09.&nbsp; I started by upgrading from WhiteRussian RC5 to Kamikaze 7.09 using the file &quot;openwrt-wrt54gs-2.4-squashfs.bin&quot; and the webif upgrade tool.&nbsp; </p><p>On this first try, I put off the wireless configuration until after more important details, such as OpenVPN.&nbsp; I configured everything by modifying the config files in /etc/config by hand.&nbsp; After much frustration in trying to get wireless to work, I still could not get WPA to work properly.&nbsp; I could get the wireless to work without encryption, and maybe with WEP (I can&#039;t remember).&nbsp; I figured that I had probably screwed up something while installing OpenVPN, so I thought I would try it again.&nbsp; I reflashed using TFTP and tried again from scratch.&nbsp; This time, I configured the LAN IP address and Gateway, and then immediately tried to configure the wireless.&nbsp; Again, no luck. </p><p>I then decided to &quot;drink the Cool-Aid&quot; and install the X-Wrt web interface.&nbsp; I figured that it might be something as stupid as a typo or a peculiarity of the config file that I had just missed by configuring the files by hand.&nbsp; So, I reflashed again, immediately installed X-Wrt, and repeated the last attempt by first configuring the IP and Gateway, then straight to the wireless.&nbsp; This time, I had partial success.&nbsp; It initially worked, and I thought I had figured it out, but it then stopped working some time later.&nbsp; I then tried a bunch of configuration changes.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember if it ever worked again even temporarily when doing this, but when it didn&#039;t work, I got the two following messages:</p><p>&quot;There was an error joining the AirPort network &#039;checktest&#039;.&quot;<br />&quot;The wireless network &#039;checktest&#039; does not support the requested encryption method.&quot;</p><p>I am connecting on my only laptop, a Macbook Pro.&nbsp; When I select my router from the list of detected routers, I get the first message.&nbsp; When I select &quot;Other...&quot; and enter the essid, select WPA Personal, and enter the password, I get the second error message.&nbsp; </p><p>Here is my /etc/config/network file:</p><p>#### VLAN configuration<br />config switch eth0<br />&nbsp;

					<p>Having made no progress, I tried the generic broadcomm openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx file and reinstalled Kamikaze.&nbsp; Using the same configuration, I can now connect to the router with my laptop, but the connection goes down a short time later.&nbsp; (maybe 30sec to 1 min)&nbsp; If I let it sit there, it will come back up a minute or so later, and then go down again and continues to repeat the pattern.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a quick hunch.&nbsp; Like it or not, there remains some interaction with nvram settings and proprietary Broadcom modules.&nbsp; I ran into it in Kamikaze 7.06 with mac addresses and default nvram settings.&nbsp; Be sure the basic il0macaddr and et0macaddr values are sane values.&nbsp; Extra settings like lan_hwaddr, wan_hwaddr and wl0_hwaddr are often set but I don&#039;t think are a factor.</p><p>A 7.09 install on a GS-v3 seemed to run ok in non-production use for me but I keep running into little nuisances lacking in the Kamikaze platform, ALWAYS in wireless function, so exclusively run Whiterussian 0.9 in production.</p>									</div>
