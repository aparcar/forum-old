					<p>Found Some info in the wiki;<br />&quot;The OpenWrt buildroot generates images that can be directly flashed to the NS2, usually with a name like openwrt-atheros-ubnt2-squashfs.bin.&quot;<br />Sounds easy.</p><p>But I don&#039;t understand ; <br />&quot;In order to upgrade from OpenWrt to a newer version, both the kernel mtd and filesystem mtd must be reflashed. The kernel is likely lzma compressed. If either mtd block isn&#039;t big enough, reflashing can not be completed through OpenWrt, but must be done through the RedBoot bootloader. &quot;</p><p>Is this just saying the GUI won&#039;t, but Tftping to the device and reflashing will ?</p><p>The rollback described uses Tftp to recover back to their Air OS.</p><p>Guess I&#039;m just being paranoid. I hate bricks ;o)</p>									</div>
