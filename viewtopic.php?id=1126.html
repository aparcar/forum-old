					<p>I have installed OpenWRT successfully on my WRT54GS (1.0, I think). That is: I can telnet to the device and play around. In the original Linksys software I had configured my LAN access as well as my WAN-access (thru PPPoE). However, now my computer cannot connect to the internet. </p><p>I actually thought that the original configuration was saved by OpenWRT and used automatically when starting freshly with OpenWRT. Apparently this is not the case - at least not with PPPoE (?). How do I get PPPoE installed and working? </p><p>I have found some information on PPPoE. What I don&#039;t understand is this: I have installed the latest snapshot. Does this mean I have no PPPoE installed? And if that is the case, how am I supposed to install PPPoE with ipkg without an internet connection?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can download the ipkg and the file packages to your local webserver. Then you may drop connection to internet and add your local webserver to ipkg.conf.<br />Then you can install the pppoe (i work with pppoecd) from your local webserver with ipkg.<br />Or download it to your local ftp-server and &quot;wget&quot; can bring it to your router.</p><p>A good description is at:</p><p><a href="http://www.freifunk.net/wiki/FreifunkFirmware">http://www.freifunk.net/wiki/FreifunkFirmware</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(German)<br /><a href="http://www.freifunk.net/wiki/FreifunkFirmwareEnglish">http://www.freifunk.net/wiki/FreifunkFirmwareEnglish</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; (English)</p><p>In the beginning openwrt is not easy, but if you did some practice you will love it because you will find a new feature or new idea what to do with it everyday.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, sure - it&#039;s not that I haven&#039;t done something like this before but I am totally new to this device. Thanks very much for your hints.<br />May be a stupid question: Can I use the Freifunk pppoe package with the ordinary OpenWRT snapshot?</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t try it, but i think it will work.<br />Or try the freifunk-firmware itself.<br />It works for me very good. You might not need olsr (i need it), but dropbear i think is essential.</p>									</div>
