					<p>Hi all,<br />I did a little drawing to explain my situation.</p><p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/necf9adhx/"><span class="postimg"><img src="https://s10.postimg.org/necf9adhx/actual.jpg" alt="https://s10.postimg.org/necf9adhx/actual.jpg" /></span></a></p><p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/3rwhk0yrv/"><span class="postimg"><img src="https://s9.postimg.org/3rwhk0yrv/future.jpg" alt="https://s9.postimg.org/3rwhk0yrv/future.jpg" /></span></a></p><p>I want to extend my wifi network using the same SSID and thus when I move in my house all the devices have to choose the best signal in transparent way and without connecting to a new wifi network.<br />The cable is connected from the modem (one port of the switch) to the AP (one port of the switch). I don&#039;t use WAN port of the AP. </p><p>Questions:<br />- Is there any way to do it with openWrt? What have I got do search for? <br />- Do I have to connect the cable in different way? </p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>You want to look at &quot;dumb AP&quot; and WDS.&nbsp; </p><p>Dumb AP will do what you want to do as far as allowing the physical connections and setting up an AP.</p><p>Seamless roaming may be a bit more difficult depending on the config and control of your &quot;modem&quot;.&nbsp; Read the WDS, BATMAN and other wiki articles on MESH.</p>									</div>

					<p>HEEY k0ral im setting up a home network im taking down all my repeaters and bridges and its going to have the&nbsp; best signal in transparent way and without connecting to a new wifi network. It&#039;s called BATMAN MESH ,<br />B.A.T.M.A.N. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is a routing protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks.If you can put OPENWRT on it you can put batman on it.It&#039;s something to read up on ,i haven&#039;t got it up and working yet or you can look at&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;dumb AP&quot; and WDS.</p>									</div>
