					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I&#039;m currently managing a Comtrend 5813 router which I have configured to be able to access remotely, and I want to install OpenWRT in it. But, if I upload this firmware the new settings won&#039;t allow me to connect to the router remotely any more, right? Is there some way to prevent this?</p><p>Thank you very much</p>									</div>

					<p>You can include your own settings in the firmware.<br />Read <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=251428#p251428">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 28#p251428</a></p><p>(in practice easiest is to configure a similar router locally, from which you then can get the correct settings.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Al right, I am now trying to configure a router to which I have direct access to allow remote web or telnet access. Is there any way I can do so through the LuCI interface?<br />Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>First set your router password to something hard to guess, and confirm on the status screen that your wan has a public IP.&nbsp; If you are using DSL, you may need to use pppoe to connect to the DSL to get a public IP.</p><p>Then go to <br />Network -- Firewall -- Traffic Rules -- Open ports on router<br />Open port 22 (TCP) for ssh and port 80 (TCP) for web.&nbsp; Never open a telnet port to the Internet because there will be no security.&nbsp; </p><p>If you have open only the ssh port, you can ssh tunnel to port 80 to access the LuCI securely.&nbsp; On your remote machine, use the command:<br />ssh root@&lt;router public address&gt; -L 8080:192.168.1.1:80<br />(If you have changed the router&#039;s LAN IP from 192.168.1.1, use whatever you changed it to)<br />After logging into the router, leave the ssh connection open and take your PC&#039;s web browser to http://localhost:8080 and it will be the router&#039;s web page.<br />This can also be used to administer printers, VoIP ATA&#039;s, etc. on the LAN that have a web interface.</p><p>The wiki has some advice on techniques to improve security.</p>									</div>
