					<p>I&#039;m stuck, maybe someone here can kindly advise?</p><p>I&#039;ve got in a pile of WRTs to muck about with, both G and GS models, mainly versions 1 - 2. I&#039;ve pretty much sussed the main open source firmware for them (openwrt, dd, etc) and had a lot of fun so far making these little babies do more than the overpriced commercial Cisco enterprise kit I work with, I&#039;m competent with Linux and work in internetworking / network security so I hit the ground running. However, I want to attach external media to it, SD card, USB, I don&#039;t care, but this just defeats me - soldering to those tiny points is beyond me - I have tried and tried and tried, but I just can&#039;t work out how the hell you guys manage to solder between those bus lanes without shorting anything.</p><p>I&#039;m no sparky <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Not one to ask for help lightly, I bought the WRT Hacking book and have checked every thread on the net - repeatedly, but those RP4 pins on the GS are just too tiny. I thought all of my ships had come in when I discovered &quot;Wire Glue&quot; - the perfect cheat for this job, but it&#039;s worse than solder as it runs everywhere. 2 weeks of trying, utter failure. Now I must admit, my soldering iron tip looks like a shovel compared to these connectors, but even with a needle tip I don&#039;t think I can do it.</p><p>Now I&#039;m sat here staring at JP1 and JP2 on a GS V1.1 - can&#039;t I just use these to connect a serial port and then convert that serial to USB? </p><p>I have attached a 10 pin IDC port to it and have made a JTAG cable - is there any way to convert this to support external media?</p><p>Any advice here would be seriously appreciated.</p>									</div>
