					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently bought the above mentioned buffalo router which came with ddwrt preinstalled. In the hope of running openwrt on it i have tried to tftp openwrt firmware following the instructions on toh.Unfortunately the tftp times out. I have tried setting up a static arp on a laptop with a 10/100 ethernet port. But that doesnt help. I dont want to go via the overwrite mtd route mentioned in the wiki as it doesnt sound safe.</p><p>any idea what could be wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for letting us know you solved it. I&#039;m considering picking up one of these routers--very nice specs for the price.</p>									</div>
