					<p>Hi community, I&#039;m a new user!. Sorry for my English, i don&#039;t speak english..</p><p>I try use two wifi interfaces to create my wifi lan network. I use the router Alfa R36 with internal antenna and USB adapter RTL8187.</p><p>The USB RTL8187 it&#039;s installed with &quot;opkg install kmod-rtl8187&quot;. In the openwrt web interface has appeared as &quot;ralink 3050&quot;, but i think that it isn&#039;t the problem.</p><p>I connect this adapter usb to any wifi exist, and my intention its create my custom wifi with internal antenna of Alfa R36.</p><p>So i have &quot;lan&quot; and &quot;wan&quot; connections. The &quot;lan&quot; connection its a internal anntena of Alfa R36, while that &quot;wan&quot; connection its a external USB RTL8187.</p><p>&quot;lan&quot; has a static ip &quot;192.168.2.1&quot;<br />&quot;wan&quot; has a static ip &quot;192.168.1.33 / 255.255.255.0 / 192.168.1.1&quot;</p><p>The connection is lost in a few seconds. My feeling is that output the packets is correctly, but after, lost the input packets.</p><p>While i configure the &quot;firewall&quot; and &quot;route tables&quot; i see in &quot;interfaces&quot; section, &quot;lan&quot; and &quot;wan&quot; never has green status, but her colours change.</p><p>Help or ideas for me?Â¿ any valid firewall configuration for me? I feel lost in the last moment. Thank&#039;s!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>onlypalmero</strong> on 17 Jan 2016, 05:24)</p>

					<p>Hello world again.</p><p>After performing some tests on web configuration interface OpenWRT. I came to the conclusion that after switching on the router, the connection is perfect from this to the other router that provides Internet. But at the time when I connect a client to the router with OpenWRT, it begins to saturate and lose packets for both the router and clients connected to it.</p><p>I do not quite understand why this can happen. Someone can tell me how can I set it? I think the problem I have with the routes table, with the firewall or perhaps even have to make a VLAN that connects the two interfaces (LAN clients connected to the router with OpenWRT, and WAN antenna that connects to the router that provides the connection). I do not know very well.</p>									</div>
