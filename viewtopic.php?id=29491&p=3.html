					<p>I see. <br/>My ubuntu build worked the first time and then it never works again. Streaming audio from iphone to ubuntu worked.<br/>Now my iphone (4.2.1) does not see shairport anymore even after multiple reboots. Shairport port is open and telnet to port 5000 shows that it can receive connections. <br/>Same issue with my openwrt build.<br/>Seems to be an issue with the phone.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong><br/>Found out the problem is with the router.

					<p>I&#039;ve got this working on my router and it seems good but I&#039;m having a few problems.<br/>The main one is while it works from my computers itunes to the router, if I try and send music from my iphone it breaks up every few seconds and I get a lot of <br/><em>requesting resend on 1 packets (port 50075)<br/>requesting resend on 1 packets (port 50075)<br/>underrun.<br/>underrun.</em><br/>errors showing up, I get these with the wired connection also but they don&#039;t seem to cause the pausing.<br/>Also sometime I&#039;ll get a <em>shairport: hairtunes.c: 354: alac_decode: Assertion `outsize == (4*frame_size)&#039; </em><br/>error and everything stops working. Because my router doesn&#039;t really have space for the alsa-libs I&#039;m starting shairport with the following command </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>shairport -o 5000 --ao_driver=oss --ao_devicename=/dev/dsp4 -k 345670</code></pre></div><p>I have also tried using alsa and got the same problems. Does anyone have any ideas where I&#039;m going wrong?<br/>Thanks</p>									</div>
