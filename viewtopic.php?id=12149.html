					<p>Hello,</p><br /><p>I recently got an Asus WL-500gP, and I&#039;m less than happy with the current firmware. After some research, I found it is very limiting towards the actual hardware, and some of the problems I get with it are generalized. That&#039;s where OpenWrt gets in <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I&#039;d like to know if this firmware works OK with the router, and what kind of limitations will I have. I&#039;m far from being an expert on the subject, but I&#039;m willing to learn. My knowledge of linux is borderline basic.</p><p>Currently, I&#039;m looking to have these functions on my router:<br />- Share cable Internet through the network, Ethernet and wireless (WPA-PSK);<br />- Share files between the PCs in the network;<br />- Firewall;<br />- Connect an USB HDD (WD Elements 500Gb) and share the contents through the network, with restricted access on some folders;<br />- Something like &quot;Download Master&quot; (but one which actually works), giving me the chance of letting the router downloading directly to the USB disk with all PCs off. Mostly torrents;<br />- Eventually as a plus, the chance of connecting a VoIP phone to USB.</p><p>The network is made of 3-4 PCs, using mostly Vista/XP. </p><p>I&#039;d get these from the official firmware.... if it worked. Can OpenWrt provide me with these functions? If so, what version should I go for, and what/where can I learn to get this to work?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Gnitrops</p>									</div>

					<p>i have the same device, and just yesterday installed openwrt/wr, so far i can tell you:</p><p>- Share cable Internet through the network, Ethernet and wireless (WPA-PSK);<br />easily</p><p>- Share files between the PCs in the network;<br />easily</p><p>- Firewall;<br />openwrt has a preconfigured firewall, its netfileter (iptables) based and easy to maintain if you have a clue about netfilter. there is also a webinterface for managing it, but i never tried it, and does not look too simple to me</p><p>- Connect an USB HDD (WD Elements 500Gb) and share the contents through the network, with restricted access on some folders;<br />should be easily possible, but i heared usb2.0 support is broken in Whiterussian. if you chose to use kamikaze you wont have the nice webinterface for configuring all the basic stuff</p><p>- Something like &quot;Download Master&quot; (but one which actually works), giving me the chance of letting the router downloading directly to the USB disk with all PCs off. Mostly torrents;<br />there is torrent clients available</p><p>- Eventually as a plus, the chance of connecting a VoIP phone to USB.<br />no idea, but with asterisk being available it should be possible</p>									</div>
