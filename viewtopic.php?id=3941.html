					<p>I have read the common mistakes.....reviewed my rules...and nothing seems to be working.</p><p>here is my firewall.user file:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
. /etc/functions.sh

WAN=$(nvram get wan_ifname)
LAN=$(nvram get lan_ifname)

iptables -F input_rule
iptables -F output_rule
iptables -F forwarding_rule
iptables -t nat -F prerouting_rule
iptables -t nat -F postrouting_rule

### BIG FAT DISCLAIMER
### The &quot;-i $WAN&quot; literally means packets that came in over the $WAN interface;
### this WILL NOT MATCH packets sent from the LAN to the WAN address.

### Allow SSH on the WAN interface
# iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
# iptables        -A input_rule      -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

### Port forwarding
# iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 22 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.100
# iptables        -A forwarding_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 22 -d 192.168.1.2 -j ACCEPT

iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 113 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.100
iptables        -A forwarding_rule -i $WAN -p tcp --dport 113 -d 192.168.1.2 -j ACCEPT

### DMZ (should be placed after port forwarding / accept rules)
# iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -i $WAN -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.2
# iptables        -A forwarding_rule -i $WAN -d 192.168.1.2 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>I have entered a simple rule to map port 113 (identd) to an inside ip.</p><p>Why is my rules being completely ignored?</p>									</div>

I was just working with way too many rules all at once making it too difficult to troubleshoot.</p><p>Its now working much better, thanks for your help.</p>									</div>
