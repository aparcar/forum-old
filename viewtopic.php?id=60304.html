					<p>Hi, I&#039;m using a HuaWei HG255d(CPU RT3052), but the order of its LAN ports is not correct in OpenWrt(CC15.05 stable).</p><p>I want to&nbsp; fix the sort order of Lan ports of my HG255d&#039;s, by editing some *.h file.<br />I checked the machine file of it, but the define looks like not in here.<br />Where is the define about the order of the LAN ports ?<br /> Can I fix it only by editing a *.h file ?<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>
