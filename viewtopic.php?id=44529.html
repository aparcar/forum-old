					<p>I&#039;ll post my experience with Sagem F@st 2604... There are 2 images in the trunk but none of them worked for me. There is a note on the wiki page that latest image from trunk should work but you have to manually type firstboot command via serial console which requires special cable and opening device <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/sagem/fast2404#notes">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/sagem/fast2404#notes</a>.</p><p>I stumbled upon a version that worked without using serial cable. It is a firmware from some Spanish forum (<a href="http://foro.seguridadwireless.net/openwrt/openwrt-en-sagem-fst2604/">http://foro.seguridadwireless.net/openw … m-fst2604/</a>). It is important that you get to the bootloader firmware upload page as described on wiki page (power led light turns red). Flash this firmware:<br />openwrt-F@ST2604-squashfs-cfe_r33081.bin (2.3 MB) <br /><a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!ItV0wI7R!cGgdDSYOvRptsyGhglWdtFqQr8lKJJ8qR6QXoOrwA9Q">https://mega.co.nz/#!ItV0wI7R!cGgdDSYOv … 6QXoOrwA9Q</a><br />Then connect with putty (telnet) to 192.168.1.1 and change your password. After that, you can connect via SSH and do whatever you want. LuCI interface is not backed in the firmware but if you get this router to internet (I managed after setting gateway and dns in the /etc/config/network) you get install any package, LuCI also.</p><p>Telnet interface after flashing:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>BusyBox v1.15.3 (2013-04-13 00:25:58 CEST) built-in shell (ash)

					<p>Thank you so much. I thought I wouldn&#039;t get an answer and then this. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>A few questions:</p><p>1) The version of the firmware on that spanish forum is different from the one you linked to. Which one to use?</p><p>2) By saying that to connect you had to setup a gateway in /etc/config/network you mean that you didn&#039;t use this as a modem? I use this as a modem/router and from what I read, to use PPPoA there is a package (ppp-mod-pppoa) that needs to be installed. Do these firmware images come with it installed?</p><p>3) where do these working wrt version come from, and why don&#039;t they get listed on the wiki? (this question is less relevant)</p><p>Thank you again for your time, and thank you in advanced.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fullmooninu</strong> on 24 Sep 2013, 03:44)</p>
