					<p>Hi, I am trying to build a jffs2 image for AA (release version) but whatever package (such as luci) I select would not be included when I flash the image. The flashed OS only contains the bare minimum looking like a default config. The same squashfs image generated however, works fine. Is this an intended behavior? I am building an image for TP-LINK WDR4310. Thanks.</p>									</div>
