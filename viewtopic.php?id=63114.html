					<p>I&#039;m attempting to flash OpenWRT on my Huawei HG630b router.</p><p>So far I&#039;ve gotten as far as hooking up my CP2102 UART to it.<br />(I&#039;ve also tried hooking up my FTDI UART to it).</p><p>There was no wiki page so I went off the most similar router:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/huawei/hg655d">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/huawei/hg655d</a><br />The board was extremely similar to mine so I think it&#039;s fair to believe that the headers on the board are the same.</p><p>The board and my temp wiring:<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/a/rGBtF">http://imgur.com/a/rGBtF</a><br />Note: My CP2102 doesn&#039;t have a VCC header, but my FTDI does; however using this still didn&#039;t make a difference.</p><p>However, whenever I attach either UART and start up the router I get the following garbled output:<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/GwRrSqU">http://imgur.com/GwRrSqU</a></p><p>I&#039;ve read the port.serial part of the wiki and have triple checked that my wiring is secured to the board. I also went ahead and tried all 3 speeds/baud. <br />Even after all of this, I still somehow manage to get the garbled output.</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>									</div>
