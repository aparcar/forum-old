					<p>Hi all,<br />Openwrt is a lot of fun, and I am almost down with my project.&nbsp; However, I am having some trouble what seems to be a simple problem.</p><p>I have added some start up scripts in /etc/init.d and linked them in /etc/rc.d.&nbsp; I also added a line in rc.local.&nbsp; In both cases, the echo command does not function.&nbsp; The other commands in the script are executing, but not the message posts.&nbsp; I would like to post an echo message to tell the user that the boot sequence has been finished, but so far, nothing gets posted using echo.&nbsp; Anyone know a way to do this?</p><p>Thanks,<br />-J</p>									</div>

					<p>That worked to put the message into the boot log, but how can you post it on the boot message?</p><p>Basically I want my message to appear in dmesg so that the &quot;boot complete&quot; message can be read by the serial port, and start something else in another embedded system (which is monitoring for that message).</p>									</div>
