					<p>Hi,</p><p>The title says it all. Where can I find the .config files that are used to create the experimental binaries? Specifically I&#039;d like to see how to create <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/experimental/bin/openwrt-wrt54gs-jffs2.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/experiment … -jffs2.bin</a> and <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/experimental/bin/openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/experiment … uashfs.bin</a>.</p><p>I&#039;m looking to start building a couple custom packages, but I would like to make sure I have the same default configuration. That and I&#039;m just plain curious. I looked around, but couldn&#039;t seem to find the files listed anywhere.</p><p>Also, am I correct in assuming that I should be able to drop the .config.openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs in my openwrt directory (renamed as .config of course) and just run &quot;make&quot; to hopefully get a binary match of <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/experimental/bin/openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/experiment … uashfs.bin</a>?</p><p>Dave</p>									</div>
