					<p>So i am really new to this, i was wondering how do i access trunk? ( and when in trunk do i have to build the latest build myself or will there be a folder with the img on it),</p><p>Also i have a fresh router, if i have to build the latest image myself would somebody be able to share the latest version that also has LuCi ( not sure how to tell if it has it or not, and what it is) i tried reading through the wiki but i did not find enough answer all i know is the latest offical fw is 15.05 but i rather the recent builds im sure they have more improvements regardless if there ends up being more bugs down the line.</p>									</div>
