					<p>Hello there, well I have a problem with my TL-WA901ND v4. I think it is bricked!</p><p>I used this link of (I am not allowed to post links, remove the space between htt &amp; ps in the following link)</p><p> htt ps://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa901nd-v4-squashfs-factory.bin </p><p>to install OpenWRT on my TL-WA901ND v4 and was installed succesfully but without web interface, only ssh on 22. Then, I installed LuCI but as you know, there was not enough space for it to install properly.<br />If only I had noticed the links of hostle19 in the first time, I surely would avoid this problem. After that, I managed to restore the original tp-link firmware with the mtd command and , you know, I saw the line error of &quot; [e]Failed to erase block&quot; </p><p>From this point, my router is bricked with power LED constantly on and the others looping with flashing ON for 2 seconds, and then OFF for 3 seconds. I can&#039;t also ping it or see it via LAN because the network adapter icon has a red &quot;X&quot; if you know what I mean (bottom-right in windows toolbar). I tried TFTP recovery with my ip set as 192.168.0.66 and 192.168.1.100 , but without luck.</p><p>My question is can TFTP recovery works when the computer cannot see it like I described above? Or my only solution is to go serial?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xngalanis</strong> on 10 May 2017, 12:40)</p>
