					<p>I found that Luci has a page where you can download all the settings from the router to your PC in .tar.gz format. It is quite handy.<br />I added/modified files outside of /etc/config dirs on my GLInet AR300 openwrt router.<br />Is there any master list that I can modify to include the custom files that I added so that they get included in the downloaded tar archive?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
