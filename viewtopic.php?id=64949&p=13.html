					<p>@Redferne</p><p>Please update opkg and try to install kmod-usb-hid again as the package should be there.</p><p>Basically, the #1 goal is to keep the build as lightweight as possible, but yet have some of the most popular features pre-installed. This is the reason why some packages just need to be installed separately, and now that it looks like that is sorted out, the repository will be built back up to where it should be.</p><p>It&#039;s no bother at all.

Brainslayer has the code for the wrt3200acm and the hardware, as you probably know. So maybe the wireless code is a backport/fork that he did. Anyway just wondered if you had heard of it and I could not remember where to check with kaloz. </p><p>I agree with you that the latest wireless drivers work very well. I do a simple iperf test with new driver builds and the OEM was better then the last maybe 3 wireless releases. Now your builds run much better then OEM on my wrt1900ac v1. For some reason DD-WRT, both Kong and Brainslayer, cannot get good performance out of the latest, 10.3.0.18-20160823-1, so they dropped back to 10.3.0.18-20160804. Maybe this is his way of moving forward. Does work as well for me. </p><p>BUT I do like your builds and the Luci interface better. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>--bill</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 8 Oct 2016, 17:35)</p>
