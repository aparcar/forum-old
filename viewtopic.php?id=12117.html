					<p>The Buffalo WHR-G54S has a slide switch, marked &quot;AUTO/BRI&quot;. I&#039;d like to read this to determine which of two possible configs to run.</p><p>Now, I&#039;ve worked out that if you install a script /etc/hotplug.d/button/bridge, it is invoked whenever the switch changes position, with ACTION=pressed or ACTION=released.</p><p>Unfortunately, the polarity of the switch varies depending on how it was set initially. That is:</p><p>* If the switch was set to AUTO when the box initially booted, moving it to BRI gives a &quot;pressed&quot; action and moving to AUTO gives &quot;released&quot;<br />* If the switch was set to BRI when the box intially booted, moving it to AUTO gives a &quot;pressed&quot; action and moving to BRI gives &quot;released&quot;</p><p>This makes the switch pretty useless :-( In any case, I&#039;d also like to be able to read the &quot;current&quot; position of the switch at startup, without it being moved at all.</p><p>So is there any way to read the absolute position of the switch? According to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Buffalo/WHR-G54S">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ o/WHR-G54S</a> it&#039;s GPIO bit 5, but I can&#039;t see how to read that. There&#039;s /proc/diag/gpiomask but that always reads 0x0000</p><p>I am running Kamikaze 7.07, brcm-2.4</p><p>Many thanks... Brian.</p>									</div>
