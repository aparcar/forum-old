					<p>Hi All,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How should I integrate my application(some Dummy code) (I donot want to generate the dummy.ipk through Opewrt SDK) into the OpenWRT machine so that when I generate the image and load onto the target, my dummy code output (./dummy) should run as a normal command as(ifconfig or ls when typed on a sytem). </p><p>In short How should I integrate my application code into the OpenWRT image&#039;s filesystem??</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Powar</p>									</div>

					<p>Pardon for the followup question.&nbsp; Does that mean that this feature provides that any files which you put in &quot;files&quot; will be copied &quot;as is&quot; to the target in the directory in which they are found under &quot;files&quot;.&nbsp; That is, you don&#039;t put source here which will be compiled, but, for instance, documents, scripts, executables, etc.?&nbsp; If you wanted something to be placed in /home/username, you would put it in files/home/username?&nbsp; Will it create directories if they don&#039;t exist?</p><p>Good point about the documentation.&nbsp; It&#039;s catch as catch can.&nbsp; It&#039;s nobodies job so what can be done?</p>									</div>
