					<p>I flashed the original firmware fine.&nbsp; Got into the configuration fine and set the root password. Then I started setting up the router as an access point.&nbsp; At some point the LuCI GUI started not starting or starting very slowly.&nbsp; I&#039;m now at the point when if I access LuCI I just get a black screen that never proceeds to the login.&nbsp; Since this has occured I have tried changing my IP to static similar to the router and telnet&#039;ing/ssh though putty.&nbsp; Never once has it connected and it times out in about 20 seconds.&nbsp; I have tried setting it into failsafe mode which seems to be working however it still refuses any connection.&nbsp; I do have the ability to run linux if need be to fix this problem.&nbsp; Any help anyone could give me would be appreciated.&nbsp; I will start to search for more links around the forum just wanted to get this post out there in case someone could direct me better.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Red40</strong> on 30 Jul 2015, 19:02)</p>

If failsafe is working, telnet is enabled. No password is required (via telnet) in failsafe. I believe ping should also work. So to me, it doesn&#039;t sound like you&#039;ve gotten into failsafe. </p><p>Other things to try: <br />- Make sure you set a static IP on your PC in the same range. <br />- Make sure you are using a wired connection (wireless is not enabled in failsafe)<br />- A few routers require that you connect to the WAN port instead of a LAN port, but I don&#039;t think this is one of them. </p><p>Can you also provide a link to the exact file you flashed?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 29 Jul 2015, 22:16)</p>

					<p>Did you run &quot;mount_root&quot; as instructed in the failsafe page on the wiki? Do that then &quot;firstboot&quot; to reset to defaults. Reboot the router and configure everything using the web interface. Or go back to stock, but be careful doing that - you can brick your router doing that as well. The wiki is helpful here too, but you&#039;ll actually have to follow those directions carefully or you will have a brick.</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you follow the wiki carefully? Did you try both methods of rapidly pressing the hardware button during boot? Did you try timing it as soon as the Sys LED lights up? This advice is all in the wiki.</p><p>You also have the option of a TFTP flash recovery. Also well described in the wiki. </p><p>Are you connecting over an ethernet (i.e. not wireless) connection?
