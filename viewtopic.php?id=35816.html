					<p>hello,</p><p>This is my first post so let me first congrat with all of you for the wonderful work you&#039;re doing with openwrt. I&#039;ve been using a customized backfire-10.03.01 image on a Pirelli DRG A226M (8Mb flash) as a starting point for learning and now I feel eager to experiment more with the latest trunk <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Last weekend, following the wiki instructions, I&#039;ve downloaded through svn the latest trunk and started building a first basic image (thanks god we have quad-cores nowadays <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ). It all went well and I was able to flash a minimalistic (no gui interface) image to my router. After doing that, I&#039;ve reconfigured said image to include luci package but I got this error that wasn&#039;t able to resolve:</p> <br /><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...

I&#039;ve tried to upgrade the luci&#039;s feed as suggested in the wiki with the following commands</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$&gt; cd ~/dev/hacking/FW226M/trunk
$&gt; ./scripts/feeds update
$&gt; ./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci
$&gt; make package/luci/</code></pre></div><p>But the result is always the same except for the svn revision that gets updated (for now) to 8381. To me it seems that it&#039;s related to the Makefile but where to look? I&#039;m not too much acquainted with the syntax of makefile nor have understood completely in which order makefiles get executed.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using always the same user &#039;pierigno&#039;.&nbsp; May it be an error in the makefiles provided by luci? It seems they use a mixture of absolute and relative paths and so I get this error. Unfortunately, I wasn&#039;t able to identify where this move occour looking at the makefiles.</p>									</div>

					<p>Normal would be to edit feeds.conf.default in buildroot root (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/feeds.conf.default">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/f â€¦ nf.default</a>) to have Luci enabled (like it is by default). And then just update and install the feeds without extra parameters. After installing new feeds, it is good to run also &#039;make defconfig&#039;.</p><p>./scripts/feeds update -a<br />./scripts/feeds install -a<br />make defconfig<br />make </p><p>Make builds also Luci modules into the firmware, which you can then flash. Additionally, it builds the modules also to the packages subdirectory in the final binary directory, from where it is possible for you to copy the moduyles separately and install through opkg.</p><br /><p>It might also be that your build system has some leftovers from older build attempts, so you might run &#039;make clean&#039; first.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 29 Mar 2012, 12:46)</p>

					<p>thanks hnyman, I&#039;ve followed your advice and issued a make defconfig after a make clean. Effectively I decommented the luci repository in feeds.conf and not feeds.conf.default. I&#039;ve reverted my changes now, commenting everything in feeds.conf and leaving uncommented in feeds.conf.default only packages, xwrt and luci. Let see which packages brings down for compilation now.</p><p>Just one question: as I said early, I&#039;ve successfully built the&nbsp; toolchain and the sdk with my first attempt to build an openwrt image based on trunk. If I wanted to update my local version with the latest changes what command would I issue without having to recompile those two again?</p><p>This is what svn tells me:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>pierigno@n53-sabayon ~/dev/hacking/FWF226M/trunk $ svn status
svn: warning: W155007: &#039;/home/pierigno/dev/hacking/FWF226M/trunk&#039; is not a working copy</code></pre></div><p>and </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>pierigno@n53-sabayon ~/dev/hacking/FWF226M/trunk $ svn up
Skipped &#039;.&#039;
Summary of conflicts:
  Skipped paths: 1</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve followed the wiki instructions [url]<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a>[url]and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a>, specifically</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$&gt; cd ~/dev/hacking/FW226M/
$&gt; svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/</code></pre></div><p>This, as I&#039;ve undestand from svn documentation, should create a directory &#039;trunk&#039; which would become my local working copy and in which I would be able to &#039;svn up&#039; and issue all svn nice commands. However this is not the case. Am I suppose to run an additional command? which is it?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pierigno</strong> on 29 Mar 2012, 14:29)</p>

					<p>ok, I&#039;ve wiped out everything and started from scratch, this time using git (I&#039;m more acquainted with it). I see there is a second git repository for packages. Is it just for those who want to build packages only or do I actually need to use it?</p>									</div>
