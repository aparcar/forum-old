					<p>Hi, I need help, this is the only router we have that has OpenWrt on it. Everything else has dd-wrt, bad word here, I know, but that&#039;s it.</p><p>Because of that when something needs changing in the network system, it is a royal pain to have to go searching how to do it as this tired old mind has forgotten. I only installed OpenWrt on it originally to have a look and I like it, but we are entrenched with dd-wrt and out of my hands.</p><p>Sooo, can someone please give me instructions how to roll this back to a dd-wrt? Or the Buffalo factory which I seem to think was their dd-wrt fork. </p><p>It is<br />Buffalo WHR-300HP -- actually <br />Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N -- this is what it shows<br />OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530) </p><p>I tried just installing the dd-wrt .bin but OpenWrt just refused it. Same for the Buffalo Firmware.</p><p>Hate to have to throw the router out and buy a new one.</p>									</div>
