					<p>I&#039;m still trying to come up to speed with OpenWRT/LEDE. I&#039;ve been running Linux for 12+ years but there is some learning going on here.</p><p>I recently installed r2695 on my WRT1900ACS v2. I&#039;m now, again, back to stock. Here are a couple of the reasons:</p><p>1) Stock firmware has the ability to turn the radios on and off based on a schedule. I need this capability. I got lost in all of the packages. Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p><p>2) I had to turn Network Interface Wan6 off. It was causing various errors to show up in my modem. My modem is a HT1100 Hughesnet Satellite modem. It doesn&#039;t complain about the stock firmware. It provides native IPv6. Of course, with Wan6 turned off, my IPv6 doesn&#039;t work.

					<p>Would anyone be willing to help explain how I can setup a VPN network (Router as a VPN client) alongside a normal ISP network, both of which would run on the same router (Linksys WRT3200). I can get only one to work at a time. So far what I have done to attempt to get this to work the way I want is this</p><p>Network Setup:</p><p>LAN&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ETH1, WLAN0, WLAN1</p><p>WAN&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ETH0</p><p>VPN0&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;TUN0</p><p>PUREVPN&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;WLAN0-1 (like a guest network setup)</p><br /><p>Firewall Setup: I did not mess with any port-forwarding or traffic rules for this.</p><p>LAN&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;WAN : Accept Input, Accept Output, Accept Forward : Masq ( ) MSS Clamp ( )</p><p>WAN&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;REJECT : Reject Input, Accept Output, Reject Forward : Masq (x) MSS Clamp (x)</p><p>VPN0&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;PUREVPN : Reject Input, Accept Output, Reject Forward : Masq (x) MSS Clamp ( )</p><p>PUREVPN&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;VPN0 : Accept Input, Accept Output, Accept Forward : Masq ( ) MSS Clamp ( )</p><br /><p>This is as far as I have gotten. So with everything setup like it is above I only get internet access when connected to PUREVPN wireless network. The VPN is working like it should as I get the IP address of the VPN server. But now the other non VPN wireless network clients (WLAN0, WLAN1) cannot connect to the internet. Please help me figure out what I am doing wrong, thank you for any help and really appreciate the forum and poeple who are willing to help.</p>									</div>

You might have to fiddle with your routing table.</p><p>It seems that your VPN might push a default route so that the default gateway is reached through the VPN. But the other zones seem to be unable to connect to that default gateway due to firewall rules, so this is why no internet for them?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guys, I am a newer user and kind of stuck. Im on the latest build currently on the WRT1900Ac V2. Im on Boot Part 2 and my boot part 1 was flashed on the previous version.
