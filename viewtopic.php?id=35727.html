					<p>Hi</p><p>I am having an odd problem with my new router.<br />I have a tp-link WR1043ND, I got it to replace an old WRT54GL because I wanted the faster wireless.</p><p>I flashed it with OpenWRT with no problems and got my basic setup running fine. An ADSL modem into the WAN port. The router sharing the internet.<br />There is also a VPN server I access using openvpn. So I grabbed the OpenVPN packages and set that up with the same configuration that I have used successfully in the past.<br />This connection seems to work, I can access the VPN server from the OpenWRT router and from my Laptop running ubuntu, but I cannot access it from any of the windows 7 pc&#039;s</p><p>I am not sure what my next step is, because the connection is working from the linux laptop, which seems to rules out firewall issues. Most of the advice I can find using google is about changing firewall settings.<br />The same OpenVPN settings worked fine on the WRT54GL running tomato. I could access the VPN from all the computers on my LAN.</p><br /><p>Any ideas what could cause this problem?</p>									</div>
