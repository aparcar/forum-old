					<p>To help encourage the growth and strength of OpenWrt, prpl Foundation is organizing the OpenWrt Summit. Co-located with ELCE in Dublin, Ireland on October 8, the OpenWrt Summit will be the first community conference focusing exclusively on OpenWrt. Free for all to attend, OpenWrt Summit does not require an ELCE ticket.</p><p>As a community centered conference, I invite users, developers, business leaders, and anyone who is hoping to make a difference in OpenWrt to submit a speaking/session proposal for the OpenWrt Summit.</p><p>Suggested topics include:</p><ul><li><p>OpenWrt introductory topics (What is OpenWrt? How to build? How to install? How to build packages?)</p></li><li><p>Hardware (Adding new OpenWrt support for hardware you created or bought, contributing back to the core)</p></li><li><p>Forks of OpenWrt (Best practices, staying close to core)</p></li><li><p>OpenWrt usage (Unique and complex scenarios)</p></li><li><p>Security (Containers, jails, etc)</p></li><li><p>Culture (Encouraging new contributors, documentation, advocacy)</p></li><li><p>Internet of Things/Internet of Everything</p></li><li><p>Future of OpenWrt</p></li></ul><p>We also welcome any other session topic related to OpenWrt. Again, I encourage everyone interested to submit a session proposal for the OpenWrt Summit. Proposals should be submitted by August 21. To learn more and to submit your proposal, please visit:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.prplfoundation.org/wiki/OpenWrt_Summit_2015">http://wiki.prplfoundation.org/wiki/OpenWrt_Summit_2015</a></p><p>Also, if you&#039;re interested in learning more about the conference, including lodging information, please visit this URL as well.</p><p>I look forward to the session proposals! If you have any questions, don&#039;t hesitate to ask..</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Eric Schultz</p>									</div>
