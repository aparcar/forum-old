					<p>The bug I encountered came to light when I bridged lan1 through lan4. In bridge mode the device has to be put into promiscuous mode. Because lan1 through lan4 are connected to the internal eth0 device, eth0 has to be put into promiscuous mode as well. The multiple promiscuous calls from lan1/lan4 seemed to lockup something in eth0 thus making lan traffic impossible.</p><p>more info: <a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=122627300611250&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m= … 50&amp;w=2</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dirkNL</strong> on 12 Nov 2008, 17:32)</p>

					<p>Just uploaded my &#039;svn diff&#039; against the openwrt trunk. You can grab it [s]here[/s]. see <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=78098#p78098">this</a> post for updated info.</p><p>Anyone who wants to start and play around can have a go with this patch. </p><p><strong>A couple of warnings:</strong><br />-No warranty, not from me and not from openwrt.<br />-A webupgrade image is provided with this patch, it should work fine but don&#039;t blame me if it doesn&#039;t.<br />-Port 4 on the switch _doesn&#039;t_ work (yet), lennert&#039;s looking into that.<br />-Wifi works, but is highly unstable, this is a matter of waiting for the ath9k-new driver to become stable...<br />-Don&#039;t make your default rootfs squash bigger than 2.5MB, it will fail to make a Linksys webupgrade image. You can always tweak around this, but I figured it won&#039;t be necessary because it&#039;s much safer to have a very small rootfs and work your way around with installing packages onto the jffs2 partition.</p><p><strong>Webupgrade information</strong><br />-Just select the webupgrade image from your pc in the firmware upgrade under the administration tab.<br />-Around 75% you&#039;ll see your routing rebooting, if that&#039;s not the case DON&#039;T turn off the power until at least an imaginary 200% progressbar status.<br />-Around 90% you&#039;ll see a second reboot, this is needed to clean up some padding that is required for the linksys webinterface flashing.<br />-The webgui should now return to a page which states &quot;Not Found&quot;, your router is STILL busy cleaning up the jffs2 partition!!!. This should take less than a minute.<br />-You should already be able to telnet to 192.168.1.1, setup a root password and ssh will be running, verify jffs2 is up with the command &#039;df&#039;.</p><p>Now you&#039;re done and running OpenWRT!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dirkNL</strong> on 15 Dec 2008, 02:12)</p>

					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>I am sure everyone is familiar with the Apple Airport Extreme, but has anyone noticed the specs on this thing? It&#039;s an amazing beast..</p><p>CPU: Marvell 88F5181</p><p>RAM: 64MB!</p><p>Flash: 16Mb!</p><p>Switch: Broadcom BCM5325E1QMG 10/100 (Sure to be a lot easier to support than Marvell based chipsets.)</p><p>Wireless: Atheros AR5008-3NX (Support for this chipset is still very alpha, as StrikerNL has so clearly demonstrated. However it is replacable, via a minipci card.)</p><p>Sure, it&#039;s only 100bT, but the memory on this thing would sure make for some serious flexibility!</p><p>Price is an issue.. Almost twice as much as the already expensive WRT-350Nv2..</p><p>There are links about for dissections on the OpenWRT hardware page.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow, that&#039;s the same pseudo-ARM926EJ-S Marvell processor that&#039;s inside the Netgear WNR854T wireless-N router.&nbsp; With that much memory and flash RAM and the extremely popular BCM5325 switch chip, the only thing preventing if from being a <strong>really</strong> popular hack is the price. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
