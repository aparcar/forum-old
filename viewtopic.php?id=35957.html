					<p>I did some searching on this, couldn&#039;t quite figure it out.</p><p>I&#039;ve got 2 routers, 1 running OpenWRT (a Netgear WNDR3700v2) as a wifi Client for the internet across the street. (the neighbor&#039;s said it&#039;s cool. I asked!) The other one&#039;s a cheap D-Link router that won&#039;t handle OpenWRT.</p><p>It seems that OpenWRT is throttling my connection with the firewall &quot;feature&quot;. So how do I turn it off?</p><p>I tried uninstalling the firewall, switching the &quot;client&quot; interface to the &quot;LAN&quot; side of the firewall... these things just seemed to break the connection between the WiFi and ethernet. I also tried &quot;Reset Counters&quot; and &quot;Restart Firewall&quot; in LuCI, and sometimes that&#039;ll speed it up for a few hours, but then it slows down again. It still works! Just at roughly half speed.</p><p>So what do I do? Sorry for my ignorance, it&#039;s probably something obviuos. And thank you for your help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, unless you want to isolate and NAT yourself, plug into LAN and receive DHCP IPs from across the street.</p><p>In that case LAN and WLAN are switched together and no routing takes place. So disable dnsmsq, configure DHCP on the bridge interface and you&#039;re done.</p><p>But the question is if any perceived slowness is really due to the routing itself.</p>									</div>
