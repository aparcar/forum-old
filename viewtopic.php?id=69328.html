					<p>My understanding is that there are very few modem/router combinations and most are unsupported.</p><p>To confirm this yourself, I would go to a site like Amazon or Newegg and enter in the search terms Wireless router and ADSL.&nbsp; Then check the router database in openwrt/dd-wrt for that particular model.</p><p>I ended up getting a Netis DL-4201 ADSL modem + wired router (single port).&nbsp; It was cheap ~ $20USD and seems to handled a noisy line well.&nbsp; The documentation was poor but I found a review that was able to get it to work with my ISP in bridge mode and via pppOe.&nbsp; I set up the modems ethernet port to subnet my SOHO wireless router.</p><p>I was not interested in spending much as my ISP still uses pppoe via atm and has no plans to upgrade to ADSL2+ or VDSL.</p><p>MY SOHO wireless router presently is an old LInksys wrt54g version 8 running opensource firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 11 Jan 2017, 04:44)</p>
