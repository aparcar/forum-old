					<p>Hello. I have an archer c7 v2.0 router with open wrt FW. I would like to set in my router in a way that it connects to the ADSL router via Wi-Fi (I have already done this), then if it possible it has to send out the internet with another SSID name, in the same way as it has done in the following video: youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk<br />It works well at 2.4 GHz, but it does not work at 5 GHz. I do everything in the same way as it has to be done at 2.4 GHz, but if I turn on the master, it turns off the clint. My question is the following, why does it not work correctly?</p><p>client work normaly without master:</p><p>imgur.com/6aoKdAW</p><p>after enable master:</p><p>imgur.com/Ovy6Ox4</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>regler19</strong> on 12 Sep 2017, 01:58)</p>

					<p>You didn&#039;t say which version you&#039;re using but I would suggest trying the LEDE 17.01.2 build.&nbsp; There have been a lot of improvements and bug fixes in the ath10k driver (which runs your 5 GHz radio) since Chaos Calmer.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 12 Sep 2017, 02:22)</p>

					<p>This is the LEDE build:<br /><a href="http://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.2/targets/ar71xx/generic/lede-17.01.2-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">http://downloads.lede-project.org/relea â€¦ pgrade.bin</a><br />It will work with the late production new flash chip.&nbsp; I am not sure if kmod-ath10k and the firmware are included.&nbsp; You may need to install those at runtime to get 5 GHz working.</p>									</div>
