					<p>Hello. I hope I have posted this in the correct section of the forum.</p><p>Has anyone managed to recover a bricked TL-MR3040 (or similar router) by flashing the EEPROM chip using an SPI programmer? Or have any experience or knowledge of preparing &amp; flashing a blank EEPROM when upgrading the flash memory capacity?</p><p>I have a bricked TP-Link TL-MR3040 v2.5. I purchased it earlier this year and successfully flashed it with OpenWRT via the web GUI to use with DSLR Dashboard. It worked perfectly for a couple of weeks, then somehow turned itself into a novelty paperweight. When I turn it on there is a brief flash from the LEDs, then just a solid power LED. I have tried the many times to use the failsafe mode/serial console recovery method, but without success - no meaningful text appears, just a blank screen or a few random characters. (I suspect something on the EEPROM has become corrupted, or possibly the chip has failed.)</p><p>So I would like to try and write a fresh firmware image onto the EEPROM (in this case a Winbond W25Q32FV) using FlashRom &amp; a Raspberry Pi (3) as an SPI programmer. After some research I have an SOIC clip connected to the correct pins on the GPIO header of the Pi and FlashRom installed &amp; executing successfully. Thus far all attempts to read the current contents of the EEPROM have resulted in a 4MB file of &#039;FF&#039;s - so either something is wrong, or I have found out why this TL-MR3040 won&#039;t boot. </p><p>The next step will be to try and prepare an image to flash onto the EEPROM. I have not attempted anything like this before, but I am aware that the EEPROM will contain not just the operating code, but also device specific information such as the MAC address &amp; serial number. And that the flash memory is usually partitioned into different region. I hoped to have a dump of the current EEPROM contents to use for reference, but it looks as though that information has already vaporised. [I have a second TL-MR3040 (running OpenWRT), but I would prefer not to risk trying to make a dump of its EEPROM just in case anything goes wrong. This extremely versatile &amp; useful device alas now appears to be completely unobtainable in Europe.]</p><p>So I am in need of advice &amp; guidance on how to prepare an entire EEPROM image (based on either OpenWRT or the or the original TP-Link firmware) which can be flashed onto a blank chip (possibly a replacement, if the original is faulty). </p><p>Is there anyone who has upgraded their EEPROM or attempted a similar recovery who can help?</p><p>Thank you.</p><br /><p><span style="color: grey">[I apologise in advance if the information I seek in readily available - I too hate it when people are too lazy to search for themselves and know the torment of having to answer the same old questions again &amp; again which have already been answered dozens of times before on a forum. I have spent several months researching this as much as I can, but I have problems with my vision &amp; a disability which makes reading large amounts of text extremely difficult.]</span></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you should remove the chip from the router to try to read or write it.&nbsp; With the chip installed, the router SoC and the Pi are both trying to drive the chip.</p><p>The software in the flash of a TP-Link NOR flash router consists of 3 major partitions.&nbsp; The first 128kbyte is the bootloader.&nbsp; The last 64kbyte is the &quot;ART&quot; partition with device specific information.&nbsp; The center part of the flash is the firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The firmware space is internally divided into (for OpenWrt) a kernel image and two filesystems (one read only and one read-write), but you don&#039;t need to worry much about that.&nbsp; An OpenWrt &quot;sysuprade&quot; image consists of the kernel and the read-only /root filesystem parts.&nbsp; The read-write filesystem is created and formatted as OpenWrt boots for the first time.&nbsp; </p><p>A very nice thing about the TP-Link OpenWrt builds versus most others is that they will detect the flash size and adjust to it.&nbsp; You can simply drop a release build for a 4 MB model into a larger chip and have immediate access to the extra space.</p><p>Flashing OpenWrt is supposed to only change the firmware area.&nbsp; OpenWrt contains some software write-protections for the other partitions. The bootloader of two routers of the same model should be the same.&nbsp; The ART will be approximately the same but with differences in the MAC addresses and possibly the radio calibration.&nbsp; Without a valid ART, the router can still boot and use bogus MAC addresses on the Ethernet, but the WiFi absolutely will not work.</p><p>To prepare a new blank flash chip for installation, first load OpenWrt and use it to download copies of your bootloader and ART.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /proc/mtd

					<p>@mk24</p><p><span class="bbu">Update</span><br />After a few days in bed, I&#039;ve finally managed to sit down and work my way through your (superb!) instructions and have backed up the bootloader &amp; art partitions from my working router. I haven&#039;t used scp before and spent the entire afternoon staring at error messages and alternating between Linux Mint &amp; PuTTY on Windows. But eventually I stumbled across the correct syntax and succeeded with pscp.</p><p>Both binaries look OK. For good measure I made 3 dumps of each, rebooting the router in between, and confirmed that the hashes matched. The art binary contains a block of data from 1000-143F, but is otherwise FFs.</p><p>Is the MAC address stored in clear text or scrambled in some way? I searched the art binary for the working router&#039;s MAC address, but couldn&#039;t find it. </p><p>Next on the to do list: Make one final attempt to recover some data from the bricked router&#039;s EEPROM. Build a new EEPROM image from the dumped partitions &amp; OpenWrt sysupgrade binary. And re-order some new EEPROMs. (The overseas vendor I ordered from a week ago has still not dispatched my order, so I&#039;m going to cancel.)</p><p>I was unable to find the original Winbond EEPROM from a mainstream supplier here in the UK. RSOnline have similar parts from Cypress &amp; Adesto. </p><p>Am I correct in thinking that so long as the package (SOIC-8) and basic specification (voltage, capacity, frequency etc.) are the same as the original part they could be used as a replacement? (Subject to Flashrom support.) And are there any pitfalls I should be aware of when checking the specification? Does the arrangement of the memory matter?

					<p>Thank you. I don&#039;t want to be in the position of not knowing if something is faulty or just incompatible.

The OpenWrt TL-MR3040 page (presumably the v1) lists the flash chip as a Spansion S25FL032P (now discontinued) and the one stripped down by &#039;Jarocks&#039; contained an Eon flash chip.

					<p>Problem solved. After connecting pins 3 (WP) &amp; 7 (HOLD) to 3.3V, Flashrom erased, wrote &amp; verified the W25Q64FV successfully. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>I put the EEPROM (containing the Uboot &amp; ART from the working TL-MR3040 and an OpenWRT sysupgrade image) into the bricked TL-MR3040. But alas (as before) only the power LED comes on. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Looks like the next step is to see if the serial console on the bricked router is now working. <br />If not then I&#039;ll have to remove the EEPROM and read it to double check that it wrote successfully. Then go through my ROM image again to see if I made any obvious errors.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong><span class="bbu">EDIT</span></strong><br />My pessimism was premature. Forgot that this would be a fresh OpenWRT installation, not the DSLRContoller image I used before. Can you guess where this is going? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /></p><p>That&#039;s right, the Wifi was switched off in OpenWRT by default. And there was nothing plugged into either the USB or Ethernet ports, so their LEDs were off as well. A few minutes after originally writing this post I came to my senses and thought I&#039;d better try plugging in an Ethernet cable. Sure enough the LED immediately came on and I could log in to the router on 192.168.1.1. After turning the Wifi on in OpenWRT that LED came on also and my laptop can see its SSID. Eureka!</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for all your help mk24.</strong> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/cool.png" width="15" height="15" alt="cool" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davelister</strong> on 17 Sep 2017, 05:13)</p>
