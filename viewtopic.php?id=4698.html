					<p>I just flashed my new WGT634U with the 2.6 Flyashi&#039;s jffs2 bin image. After I flashed the 634 using the web method I read the Common mistake post and it says we need to convert the bin file to a trx file. Anyway my 634 is up and running. <br />#1 Did I do something wrong by flashing the bin file, because I&#039;m unable to make changes to /etc/config/network file. <br />#2 Is there a web interface to configure the router or do i need to install any packages</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey xboxer21,</p><p>You got me in a load of trouble. Don&#039;t implicate me! I was only trying to help.</p><p>Anyway, that&#039;s my problem. Yours are:</p><p>1) Via web, you&#039;re supposed to flash the .bin. That&#039;s fine.<br />2) You should be able to make changes to /etc/config/network. It&#039;s not in /rom/, it&#039;s generated by a script. It should be editable.<br />3) There is no webif for Kamikaze. In a few months, there might be. Don&#039;t hold your breath.</p><p>So, just learn Linux. I guess that&#039;s all you can do.</p><p>Good luck, </p><p> - Yasha</p><p>P.S. If you did something wrong, it would be &quot;AAAH!! I GET A KERNEL PANIC ON MY SERIAL CONSOLE!!&quot; , not &quot;I can&#039;t edit a file.&quot; That&#039;s veeeery minor compared to a &quot;broken&quot; install. (I&#039;ve gotten kernel panics with my images. They&#039;re not very good. For best results, compile your own.)</p>									</div>

					<p>flyashi, <br />please don&#039;t get me wrong, I didn&#039;t mean to point fingers at you. <br />The router is working absolutely fine,&nbsp; I have installed some packages already, <br />Will do more reading and learn linux <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
