					<p>The very small device arrived. It identifies as &quot;Mifi&quot; but is very similar (if not identical) to the A5-V11 discussed<br />over here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43444">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43444</a> (last post). It doesn&#039;t have the antenna bug though <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Thanks to the &quot;runshellcmd&quot; trick and the automounted USB pendrive, I could dump the flash partitions (it was rather tricky to get the pendrive unmounted again). 0 is uBoot, 1 and 2 are config stuff like MAC and NVRAM, 3=4=5 is the rest, containing Kernel, Romfs, Firmware.</p><p>I dug a bit deeper, and found that the &quot;kernel&quot; partition indeed contains a rather big kernel,<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ file mtdblock3

I lzma-uncompressed that and ended up with a kernel file 5969916 bytes in size - which seems to contain the &quot;rootfs&quot; as initrd(?) - how would I extract that? (With the Aukey PB-W2 this was easy as there was a separate mtd partition for the squashfs root.)</p><p>I had to update binwalk in firmware-mod-kit (to 2.0 from github.com/devttys0/binwalk.git, I&#039;ll have to pick up sasquatch from the same author as well!), but still matryoshka mode doesn&#039;t work:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ binwalk -M mtdblock3
