There are no Tx/Rx lines on a USB bus. If you have a DKU-5 (clone) cable for Nokia, there is a USB-to-serial convertor embedded in the USB plug. The colors of my DKU-5 cable, at the GSM side of the cable are:</p><p>pin signal&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;color<br />--- ------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-----<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp;ACI (insertion/removal detect)&nbsp; &nbsp;orange<br />4&nbsp; &nbsp;VOUT (+/- 10mA)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; green<br />5&nbsp; &nbsp;N.C.<br />6&nbsp; &nbsp;RX (PC --&gt; phone)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; white<br />7&nbsp; &nbsp;TX (phone --&gt; PC)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blue<br />8&nbsp; &nbsp;GND&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; black</p><p>And yes, the converter needs power to operate, so you need to connect VOUT (green) to the 3.3V output of the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I went ahead and got another DKU-5 off ebay and this time carefully examined it. Here&#039;s my findings:</p><p>Pin 2 = GND (white)&nbsp; - mine didn&#039;t have a Pin 8<br />Pin 4 = Vout (green)<br />Pin 6 = Rx (orange)<br />Pin 7 = Tx (blue)</p><p>Even then when I tried minicom it didn&#039;t work.

					<p>I do it the lazy/dangerous way -</p><p>The pl2303 chip doesn&#039;t require additional power so the only pins you need to hook up are rx, tx, gnd; you can skip vcc.</p><p>If you connect the rx pin to the gnd or tx you&#039;ll probably get a few characters of line noise. If the rx pin is connected to the tx pin, then anything you type into the terminal application will be echoed back to you. So, just by playing with the wiring on the cable you can usually figure out the pins.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been meddling with this issue: I bought a CA-42 cable.<br />(1) Using a multimeter, I was unable to get voltages &gt; 0.25. This supports bradkarhu<br />(2) I have 5 colours: black, green, white, blue, orange.&nbsp; Both blue and white when touched to the 3rd pin from J7 get feedback from the wgt634u. What is this all about?<br />(3) Using the approach of mbm, when I try attaching different wires together, I never get text echoed back. Do I need to set a specific bits per second speed??</p>									</div>

My cable (KQ-U8A) uses an ark3116 chip, and definitively needs power from the GSM-side to operate. Without power, you will not get an echo when you connect rx and tx.
