					<p>Hi<br />I installed OpenWRT a year ago. I now would like to update it but having no success either using the &#039;sysupgrade -n -v&#039; or the LuCI Flash Firmware page. <br />It appears to work ok but does not allow me to connect on 192.168.1.1 and will not respond to ping.<br />Fortunately I can cycle the power button to restore the alternative flash but I appear to be locked into this version.<br />Anybody else had this experience?</p><br /><p>Hostname&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt <br />Model&nbsp; &nbsp; Linksys WRT1900ACv2<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.276.51144-8832d53)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.18.23</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks nitroshift<br />I have tried different images some with LuCI, none seem to work. More importantly I can&#039;t ping the box so can&#039;t ssh into it.<br />A bit strange really. I wondered whether it had anything to do with the fact that the image I originally installed was for a 1900ac not an acs.</p>									</div>
