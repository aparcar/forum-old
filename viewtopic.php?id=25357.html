I&#039;ve not seen such a feature in mac80211 either.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Is there a WWW based demo that shows what the router configuration of OpenWRT looks like and what options there are?</p></blockquote></div><p>None that I&#039;m aware of. You can search for screenshots though. The both gui projects for OpenWrt are X-Wrt and LuCI. You can also run OpenWrt in VMWare or Virtualbox to test it.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>What is the difference between OpenWRT and dd-wrt.com?</p></blockquote></div><p>DD-Wrt has its focus on readymade, binary firmwares and is more geared towards typical enduser requirements. Many claim its easier to use (at least for the basics) but it is almost impossible to compile it yourself or to add other software (there is optware but it is always hackish). OpenWrt follows the DYI approach, focus is on open sources and customization.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your explanation.</p><p>Does the dd-wrt.com firmware use the OpenWRT as its basis or is their approach based on their own software?</p><p>I would see myself as a experienced user, but still as end user, so dd-wrt.com may be more appropriate for me.</p><p>Does either, OpenWRT or dd-wrt.com allow to use the router as a VPN device? One idea of mine is to connect laptop/mobile phone to an open WiFi on the go and then tunnel to my own router at home, because i do not fully trust open WiFi. Is this VPN approach possible with OpenWRT / dd-wrt ?</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>									</div>

If you are familiar with linux-distributions it is probably easier to grasp. OpenWrt is a full blown linux-distribution with a package manager and repository. For space constrained devices like routers it makes an enormous difference. It means that you can easily tailor the software stack to your needs, and even on an entry level wrt54gl obtain enterprise grade functionality. This is in stark contrast to DD-Wrt&#039;s predefined images (although work is under way it seems: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ipkg)">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Ipkg)</a>.</p><p>I can take a wrt54gl I have here as an example of the differences making OpenWrt unique:<br />-I changed from the default web-interface after installation to X-Wrt because I like X-Wrt better (easily installed through the package system)<br />-I installed ntp to sync the time on the router (critical feature for business usage, couple of clicks installation and config&nbsp; in the web-interface)<br />-I doubled the transmit power for wireless, making the wireless available throughout the building<br />-I installed matrix tunnel for encrypted SSL connection to the web-interface (as everything else, one-click installation in web-interface)<br />-I made the router accessible from the big bad internet, so that I can access and modify my network from anywhere through the router which is always on (and rock stable I might add)<br />-I installed wake-on-lan so that I can turn on any machine in the network from the router (combining it with cron is invaluable if you want regular back-up of your PCs)<br />-I set up dnsmasq as the DNS server on the network (admittedly available on many routers)<br />-Needless to mention I guess is the numerous firewall rules for various needs, worth mentioning though is that no web-interface I have seen has been more user-friendly in this respect than X-Wrt</p><p>Of course, if you opt for a router with more power and a USB port, only your imagination puts a limit to what you can do with it. Before you know it you will start being interested in RAM, storage and CPU capacity of your router ;-)</p><p>Message? There is only one linux-distribution for routers, and it is OpenWrt. It will grow with you, others will not. For me, that is all I need to know. For you I think the fact that you made it to this forum is enough to assume that you are better off with OpenWrt. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everybody who have contributed to make OpenWrt what it is today.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would also add:<br />-An open development process. You can see what bugs are open. Bugs also tend to be fixed (thanks to our developers). With linksys you are out of luck, except if fixing your bug will bring them more money than not fixing it. If your product is no longer sold... you understand what I mean.<br />-An up to date linux system. Many other 3rd party firmwares for the WRT54G use outdated kernels which are probably unsecure or lack features.<br />-A very clean build system. You can compile your own firmware much more easily than with DD-WRT.<br />-It is free. You don&#039;t have to donate for a &quot;pro&quot; version with added features. Nothing is obfuscated by the developers so that you can&#039;t change it.</p><p>Then, what you want to do with it is your choice, as you can install packages. For me, I wanted to run an Asterisk PBX (VoIP phone server) as well as OpenVPN. OpenWRT allows me to do that.</p>									</div>
