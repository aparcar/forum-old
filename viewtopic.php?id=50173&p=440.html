The expectation is that it will eventually get solved, but something that is so hard to duplicate is very hard to debug.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen quite a few routers have similar problems, and the ones that have been fixed have all been tracked to subtle bugs in the driver. In some cases it has been years before the problem is finally tracked down and fixed (and that&#039;s when developers have been able to see the problem on their equipment)</p><p>the drivers for these APs are in a midway state where they are not yet in the upstream kernel, and the developers are working to fix the issues that have already been identified to get them into an acceptable state. It&#039;s very possible that fixing these issues will also make the drivers more reliable without the developers realizing that they&#039;ve fixed this particular issue. As such, each new driver/firmware release is greeted with hope that it will solve the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey folks,</p><p>I just bought the wrt1200ac yesterday to replace my wr1043nd after 4 years of excellent service. I flashed 15.05.1, I loaded my config from the 1043nd and after fixing the switch ports to match the wrt schema it worked like a charm.<br />Wireless ac 5ghz with fixed channel and no issues at the moment. Almost double the WiFi speed compared to 1043nd.<br />The router is blazing fast.<br />One thing i noticed though, it only shows 23mb available for software storage.
