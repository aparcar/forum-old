					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have to buy some new switches. I&#039;d like to know, if there is a switch with more than 4 ethernet gigabit ports available, supported by OpenWRT?<br />I don&#039;t need a WLAN or a WAN port, but I need a minimum of eight gigabit ethernet ports. I love OpenWRT and would like to use it on my switches, too! :-)</p><p>Any hint is really appreciated!<br />Stevie</p>									</div>

					<p>do you need just a switch (maybe with vlan-capabilities)? <br />you said you need no WLAN and no WAN. So I guess you don&#039;t need firewall/routing. So if it&#039;s just layer2 what do you need openwrt for? To initialize the vlans on the switch? I like openwrt, too, but this seems like casting pearls before swine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />You might be better off with a &quot;normal&quot; unmanaged or managed switch depending on your needs.</p>									</div>

					<p>maybe a routerboard from mikrotik. There are a lot off them, and e.g. there is some WIP on the RB493G which has 9 gigabit-ports and a decent cpu and ram (but there were/are? some problems with the NAND).</p>									</div>
