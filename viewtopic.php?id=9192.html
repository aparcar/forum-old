					<p>And another thing: <strong>STOP USING THAT STUPID PIN SHORTING HACK!</strong> <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />One thing I really don&#039;t get is why people always use JTAG to rewrite the boot loader when they made a setting that screwed up their device. It is so unlikely that the boot loader gets changed during a bad setting change, so it&#039;s really no use trying it until you&#039;ve at least erased nvram and firmware before.</p>									</div>
