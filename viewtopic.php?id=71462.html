There will be no DD release. Current Openwrt source code is to be scrapped...</p><p>Openwrt and LEDE developers have recently voted to merge again, and to continue work from the base of the current LEDE, so the current &quot;Openwrt&quot; code repo will be practically abandoned and no releases made from it.</p><p>For all practical aspects, LEDE 17.01.2 is the current stable release (released last month). It is not named Openwrt, but so what. Next release should then again be &quot;Openwrt&quot;.<br /><a href="https://lede-project.org/releases/17.01/start">https://lede-project.org/releases/17.01/start</a></p><p>If you have missed the developments, practically all active Openwrt core developers forked off a year ago, formed LEDE and continued the development there, while the old Openwrt source code has been practically unmaintained. LEDE 17.01.2 is roughly Openwrt DD as of April 2016 plus one year of further development. (and as Openwrt has seen no development since then, you could also say that it is Openwrt DD as of July 2017 plus one year of further development.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 11 Jul 2017, 16:29)</p>
