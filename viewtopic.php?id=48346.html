					<p>Hmmm... Fishing around in my various OpenWRT access points, it looks like openwrt devices that do not have static leases show up as &#039;?&#039; in dhcp - which means they are not reporting their name to the dhcp server.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.seiner.com/cz/dhcp.jpg" alt="dhcp" /></span></p><p>The two EluOnHea hosts are openwrt boxen with static leases, the androids are self-explanatory, and so on.&nbsp; The two question marks are openwrt access points without static leases.</p><p>Any idea why?&nbsp; (Not that it&#039;s a really important issue, just curious.)</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt (and a lot of other *nix based devices) don&#039;t do a dhcp request with there hostname by default.</p><p>In Luci you can set the hostname under: <br />Network -&gt; Interfaces -&gt; [interface] , and fill it out behind &#039;Hostname to send when requesting DHCP&#039;</p><p>under cli: <br /><em>uci set network.[interface].hostname=&quot;example&quot;</em></p><p>or just edit the file: /etc/config/network and add under the interface the following:<br /><em>option hostname &#039;example&#039;</em></p><p>p.s. Replace <em>[interface]</em> with the interface you want (E.g. <em>wan</em>) and of course change example to something more meaningfull</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 11 Jan 2014, 04:05)</p>
