					<p>Hi!</p><p>(this is for the WhiteRussian version of OpenWRT, aka v0.9/v1.0)</p><p>As some might know,&nbsp; some routers like Asus WL-500G Deluxe (and probably others, like LinkSys WRT54G) can sometimes reset their NVRAM on powercycle.</p><p>The result is that after a powerloss all settings are reverted to factory defaults and your family calls you up in the middle of the night, because &quot;the internet stopped to work!&quot;.</p><p>This happened 2 or three times to me, so I finally made a fix (more a workaround).</p><p>Here is it:<br /> - crate a special marker value in the nvram, that does not exist by default. It will be used to detect if the nvram content is your settings or was reset to factory defaults. I choose the value kuki=kalacs :<br /><em>nvram set kuki=kalacs</em><br /><em>nvram commit</em></p><p> - save the current nvram content to a file : <em>nvram show &gt; /usr/lib/nvram.copy</em><br /> - copy this into file <em>/bin/restore_nvram</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

kuki=$(nvram get kuki)

if [ &quot;$kuki&quot; = kalacs ]
then
  logger -t nvram NVRAM cookie OK. Doing nothing.
  return
fi

logger -t nvram NVRAM cookie wrong. Restoring NVRAM.


while read nvvar
do
  nvram set  &quot;$nvvar&quot;
done

nvram commit</code></pre></div><p>- set proper permissions: <em>chmod 755 /bin/restore_nvram</em><br /> - add file <em>/etc/init.d/S04nvramload</em> with this content:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# NVRAM restore from JFFS
#  (as the router sometimes cleans NVRAM after reboot, like on powerloss)

/bin/restore_nvram &lt; /usr/lib/nvram.copy</code></pre></div><p>- set proper permissions: <em>chmod 755 /etc/init.d/S04nvramload</em></p><p>Done!</p><p>Note: to add the above files, you cat type <em>cat &gt;/bin/restore_nvram </em>, then type (ok, copy and paste <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ) the content and finally press ctrl-d. Same for the other file.</p><br /><p>What this does is to check on each boot if the nvram settings are OK or not (they were reset). If they are OK, nothing special is done. If they were reset, they are restored from the backup file (and written back to the nvram).</p><p>Important note : If you use this script and then make a change to your NVRAM settings, do not forget to update the backup file : <em>nvram show &gt; /usr/lib/nvram.copy</em></p><p>(idea for improvement : change the nvram command to make this backup automatically)</p><p>Hope this saves a day for someone.</p><p>Regards,<br />David</p><p>PS: Idea 2 : One could skip in the script the commit line and always use the settings from file /usr/lib/nvram.copy, this way not using the NVRAM at all.</p>									</div>
