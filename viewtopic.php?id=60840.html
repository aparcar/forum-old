					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am trying to setup Linksys WRT54GL running Backfire (10.03.1, r29592) in a way that it offers multiple SSIDs, each in its separate VLAN. Internet port of the WRT54GL should be in native VLAN 1 (for management purposes), getting IP configuration via DHCP, and also trunk port for wifi VLANs, as it connects to trunk port on upstream switch. I don&#039;t care for other 4 LAN ports, actually it would be best if they were disabled altogether.</p><p>Anyone care to help me with the configuration? With config below WRT54GL got ip address from the correct DHCP pool (VLAN 1 / management), and I can see SSIDs, but I can&#039;t connect to them and obtain IP addresses from respective DHCP pools.</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p><p>Right now I have this as network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;switch&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;

					<p>It&#039;s been I while since I last cared for getting a WRT54GL up. Please apologize, if some of the answers are probably inaccurate.<br />While it was quite good hardware some years back in time, there are cheap routers out there, that are working quite more efficently. Look for a model with a minimum of 8mb flash and 32mb ram.</p><p>Nevertheless:<br />1) If you are using a backfire release, that is already using netifd, keep in mind, that your RAM will be very low, especially in combination with luci. If possible don&#039;t use the gui to save memory. kmod-zram should be possible on these devices, but I remember instabilities, while the gui worked a bit more smoothly using zram-swap.</p><p>2) the capabilities of your WRT54GL are shown by iw phy0 info:<br />look for &quot;valid interface combinations&quot;.</p><p>The following output is from an intel wifi adapter, since I don&#039;t have a WRT at my hands right now.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>         * #{ managed } &lt;= 1, #{ AP } &lt;= 1,
           total &lt;= 2, #channels &lt;= 1, STA/AP BI must match
         * #{ managed } &lt;= 2,
           total &lt;= 2, #channels &lt;= 1</code></pre></div><p>The maximum amount of AP is shown there.</p><p>3) VLANs please remember to load install kmod-8021q, afaik it&#039;s not included in early versions.<br />I remember, that with DD-WRT the switch only supports 0-15 Vlans, while kmod-8021q would allow for 0-4095 Vlans.<br />I don&#039;t remember, if I ever tried this with OpenWRT.</p><p>4) For the switch ports look at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g#switch_ports_for_vlans_-_wrt54g_v4_wrt54gs_v3">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wr … wrt54gs_v3</a><br />the numbering of the boards on the case may be in reverse to the numbering in the software.</p><p>On untagged switch ports you may need to set the pvid in the port&#039;s configuration section.<br />See <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch?s">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch?s</a>[]=vlan<br />e.g. <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;
   option &#039;vlan&#039;       &#039;0&#039;
   option &#039;device&#039;     &#039;eth0.0&#039;
   option &#039;ports&#039;      &#039;0 5t&#039;

config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;
   option &#039;vlan&#039;       &#039;110&#039;
   option &#039;device&#039;     &#039;eth0.110&#039;
   option &#039;ports&#039;      &#039; 4t 5t&#039;

config &#039;switch_port&#039;
    option &#039;port&#039;      &#039;4&#039;
    option &#039;pvid&#039;      &#039;110&#039;</code></pre></div><p>5) eth0.1 Probably that was the WAN port in the orginal configuration? I am unsure. You may need to use another management vlan or use wan (untagged) for management purposes. Look at the port numbering in 4) on how to proceed.</p><p>I guess that&#039;s all you need in order to find out, what exactly is to be done. Let me know if issues persist. I still have an old WRT54GL 1.1 on the shelf. That I could play with. I&#039;d prefer to rather not doing this within the next two weeks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi epek,</p><p>sorry for the delay and thank you for looking into it.</p><p>I know this is ancient hardware but we have dozens of them in quite good shape, I don&#039;t feel like throwing them away just yet. All they are supposed do is L2 switching for 4 wlans in separate vlans, no more than 10 users total per device, I guess they should be able to handle it.</p><p>1) I am using <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin,">https://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/ … ashfs.bin,</a> and I have no idea what netifd is. On the bright side, I don&#039;t use gui at all. Feel free to suggest some other release or snapshot which could accomplish my goal. I tried <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/generic/openwrt-brcm47xx-generic-squashfs.trx">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … uashfs.trx</a> which got me into &quot;loader ttl=100 waiting for flashing over tftp&quot;, but luckily I recovered after a few hours of reading around <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>2) There is no iw command on release I&#039;m using.</p><p>3) I couldn&#039;t find kmod-8021q for my release:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm-2.4/packages/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/ … /packages/</a></p><p>I do not understand if this kmod is needed in order to have more than 15 vlans in total, or vlans with higher PVID than 15. If former, than I don&#039;t need it as I won&#039;t have more than 4 vlans, but if latter, I do need it because my vlans are are in range from 100 to 200.</p><p>Your post was helpful although it didn&#039;t yet get me where I want to be. I&#039;ll hack some more and post an update of my proceedings. If you have some more helpful advices I&#039;d be thankful to hear them.</p>									</div>
