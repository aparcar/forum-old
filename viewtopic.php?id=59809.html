					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I just got the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">TP-Link TL-WDR4300</a> and installed OpenWrt 15.04 Chaos Calmer on it.<br />The installation went smooth and shortly afterwards I could successfully access the internet.</p><p>I only have a question about setting up the wifi: this router comes with two radio devices, reported by LuCI as:<br />Generic MAC80211 802.11bgn (radio0) Channel: 11 (2.462 GHz)<br />Atheros AR9580 802.11an (radio1) Channel: 36 (5.180 GHz)</p><p>What is the usual set up in such a scenario? <br />For now, I set the same SSID, password and security mode (WPA2) for both interfaces, is this correct? <br />Will the clients simply pick the interface they &quot;prefer&quot;?<br />Is there a better set up, e.g. to improve performance?</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>Just read up on that the other day, I ended up having different SSIDs for ac and pure n networks. From what I gathered clients are stupid and will connect to an AP they see first, not the one which has batter bandwidth.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would create one SSID on the 2.4GHz radio (let&#039;s call it WIFI), and two on the 5GHz radio (let&#039;s call them WIFI and WIFI_5G), all of them with the same password. This way, you can configure devices to choose by themselves (use the WIFI network), or force them to the 5GHz network (use the WIFI_5G network); and if you happen to own a device that can do 2.4GHz + 5GHz at the same time, it will also work (use the WIFI network).</p>									</div>

					<p>This is very interesting input, thank you. Accordingly, I now have 2 SSIDs, one for 2.4GHz + 5GHz, and one for 5GHz only.</p><p>My only concern is that in the &quot;ideal&quot; case of all &quot;good&quot; clients that can use the 5GHz network, the 2.4GHz radio will just sit idle in a corner.<br />Is there a way to load balance the two? Does this even make sense?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#802.11n">This</a> seems to imply that the 802.11bgn radio (radio0 in my case) could support 5GHz.<br />Do you guys think that this can work? How could I check it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you sure all your devices can do 5GHz? Unless you have all brand new gadgets, I guess you still have some 2.4GHz devices lying around...</p><p>On the other hand, do not take my word for this, but I believe that there are devices that can do 2.4GHz + 5GHz <em>at the same time</em> to achieve a greater bandwidth, just like the &quot;load balance&quot; that you propose. And I do not see the problem with having a unused 2.4GHz radio; I would leave it as it is now.</p>									</div>
