					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I have installed openwrt on my WNDR3700 netgear router and I&#039;m having a ball.<br />But...<br />I&#039;m running an openvpn client on the router to provide VPN for my LAN connected hosts. The configuration works as long as I use IP addresses instead of hostnames in my openvpn.conf file. <br />Otherwise it fails with the message:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>RESOLVE: Cannot resolve host address: openvpn.anonine.net: [unknown h_errno value]</code></pre></div><p>My openvpn.conf:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>client
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
dev tap0
proto udp
resolv-retry infinite
remote-random
remote openvpn.anonine.net 1194
remote openvpn.anonine.net 1195
auth-user-pass
ca /etc/openvpn/anonine/rsa/anonine.crt
user nobody
group nogroup
auth-nocache
ns-cert-type server
script-security 2
comp-lzo
reneg-sec 0
verb 3</code></pre></div><p>The bizzare thing is that I CAN resolve addresses both from the lan connected machines as well as from the router itself if I ssh to it and do a `nslookup openvpn.anonine.net`. If I run openvpn from any LAN host using the very same configuration file, it resolves just fine and connects without a problem. </p><p>EDIT:<br />I should also mention that using tcpdump I see the DNS requests being served just fine by my ISPs servers, both when using openvpn on the router and on a LAN host. In other words, this is not a DNS/dnsmasq problem. Any help is much appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>witchdoctor</strong> on 15 Jun 2012, 21:08)</p>
