					<p>There have where no update to OpenWrt for quit a while.

					<p>Indeed all links here wiki.openwrt.org/toh/nexx/wt3020#installation are dead.</p><p>It seems because downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc3... section somehow removed most probably because werge with LEDE.<br />Now only downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05 and downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1 are available. (not downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05-rc3)</p><p>The problem is that devices that have openwrt with version 15.05-rc3 installed no longer have ability to be updated with packages via opkg update and opkg install &lt;short package name&gt;</p><p>It would be great if you make previous packages available to download again under their previous paths, so that opkg update and opkg install will work again, because its very inconvenient to find for each package full path in some archive</p>									</div>

					<p>thx for updating links,</p><p>it will be also great if you could put packages of version 15.05-rc3 back to downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/, so that on version 15.05-rc3 we could use opkg update/install/list etc</p><p>I know that it is outdated and now version 15.05.1 available, but there some routers located far away I can not flash to new firmware and configure remotely, so I have to use previous version until I phisycally get them back.</p>									</div>

I was following instructions for installing S.W.O.R.D. on a Nexx device and stupidly bricked it anyway. Various instructions for installing WiFi Pineapple-like software on devices call for Chaos Calmer, which is why I specifically was using that older firmware.</p>									</div>
