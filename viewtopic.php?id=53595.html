					<p>Hello</p><p>I have the exact box as shown in this link<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/audiocodes/mp252#dokuwiki__top">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/audiocodes/ â€¦ uwiki__top</a></p><p>I have few questions and I hope that you can answer and/or forward me to the correct person :-)</p><p>I got this box when I used to have a phone line from the ISP few years ago,<br />and it has been sitting in my &quot;junk&quot; box till now when I got a new SIP line<br />and I remembered that it can be used to connect to a SIP account.<br />however I don&#039;t have the ADMIN password for it and RESET button in the back does not help<br />since it still loads the ISP firmware. <br />I talked with them and they no longer support this box and have no way to unlock it for me.<br />so I searched the internet till i found the link above&nbsp; and took the box apart<br />with the hope to put a new firmware and us it.</p><p>BUT <br />1. I have setup a SERIAL Female DB9 connector on the serial com port as shown in the picture<br />but no matter which baud speed I use from 9600 to 115200 with or without negotiations<br />all i get on the terminal screen is gibberish characters.<br />my question is what is the correct settings&nbsp; &nbsp;and DB9 pinout currently 2,3,5 are used (7 does not change anything)&nbsp; &nbsp;?<br />2. is there any other way to reset the box to its factory defaults ?<br />3. I can&#039;t find any documentation on how to change the firmware and from where to download it.</p><p>please help me get started.<br />thank You<br />Avi</p>									</div>
