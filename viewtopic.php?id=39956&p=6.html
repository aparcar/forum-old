					<p>I have been reading through and&nbsp; I am debugging what appears to be the same problem.&nbsp; I have 2 different AR9331 based systems here,&nbsp; one with a single, direct to CPU USB port and another with an onboard powered hub to provide extra ports (Alfa Hornet + another Alfa design).&nbsp; On both, a busy USB disconnects when the WLAN interface is also busy.&nbsp; I tried both of the fixes listed above by @Squonk with no change.&nbsp; I have tested it on the LSDK 9.2.0_U10.1020 source and also on a pretty stock linux-3.8,&nbsp; both exhibit the same problem.</p><p>It seems that the problem only occurs after I set an SSID,&nbsp; so scanning for networks is fine,&nbsp; but once I have set an SSID the USB disconnects (if its busy). If the USB is idle or the WLAN is idle,&nbsp; all seems fine,&nbsp; its only once you get them both busy with tasks like network traffic and file transfers that the USB gets disconnected.</p><p>Right now I am trying through other avenues to find someone who can confirm that it is possible to have both the WLAN and USB ports busy on this SOC&nbsp; using either some other version of the drivers/linux or a completely different OS.&nbsp; That would point to a SW issue and mean the problem can be solved or worked around.&nbsp; So if anyone feels their AR9331 platform can do this fine please let me know and I&#039;ll provide a really simple test to confirm it works :-)</p><p>The other avenue is to see what is happening with a USB analyser.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don&#039;t have access to one of those :-)&nbsp; Having looked at the USB lines with a probe there doesn&#039;t seem to be any &quot;additional&quot; induced noise when the WLAN is active,&nbsp; so it doesn&#039;t seem to be cross talk or interference,&nbsp; but I wouldn&#039;t rule it out.&nbsp; DMA is another area that is shared<br />and might be related to the problem.</p><p>Like others,&nbsp; I have also tested with external powered and unpowered hubs,&nbsp; no change.</p><p>Anyway,&nbsp; if anyone has any ideas they would like to see me try I am open to suggestions as I am actively trying to resolve this issue, thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>hello @david-m,</p><p>we have a product based on the alpha hornet board.. the very first post in this thread was observed using that board.&nbsp; In our experience all USB 1.1 issues go away when using a USB 2.0 HUB.&nbsp; We can run PPPD over a USB 1.1 Modem while using WiFi without issue as long as there is a HUB in between.&nbsp; As soon as the HUB is removed the USB hangs up and needs to be reset by removing and reinserting the USB device.&nbsp; &nbsp; Interestingly enough the USB 1.1 devices work fine when directly connected to the board when the WiFi is disabled.</p><p>currently running 34332 on the hornet.</p><p>take care.</p><p>--luis</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks @lsoltero,&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t sure from reading through the thread that the hub fully solved the issue, its seems it didn&#039;t work for everyone. I will retest the hornet with an external hub and see what happens.</p>									</div>
