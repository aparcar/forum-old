					<p>Good afternoon all,</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if this is the right area to post this. </p><p>I wondered if anyone could advise me on a new Wireless Router in the market that will work with my new setup and best fit for my new setup with OpenWRT.</p><p>- Two WAN connections for BT Fibre and Virgin Fibre<br />- Load-Balance/Fail-Over<br />- 200MB Virgin Fibre Internet<br />- 80MB BT Fibre Internet (backup)<br />- Dual band (if not tri-band)<br />- at least AC3200<br />- Firewall<br />- no bottleneck on 100MB WAN ports</p><p>Quite a requirement but if not viable my other option rather than purchasing something is to install OpenWRT and then just buy an access point or two..</p><p>If that&#039;s the case then can anyone tell me if the above is possible without any limitations with 100MB+ internet speeds?</p><p>Any advise would be great or if there is anything else you think I should consider on this type of setup, please advise.</p><p>Thanks everyone!</p>									</div>
