					<p>So i have installed openwrt on my router(tp link wr740n V4) and after some research i couldn&#039;t find wireless driver and i decided to revert back to original firmware. So i&#039;ve tried copying the file from my pc with scp and pscp and i accomplished anything.(it says -ash: syntax error: unexpected &quot;(&quot; and the file that i&#039;m trying to copy to the router is wr740nv4_en_3_16_5_up_boot(130329).bin i&#039;ve also tried removing the brackets). Can you please help me get back to the original firmware, i&#039;m trying 1 week to resolve this...</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>I found antenna, but it&#039;s more expensive than the router XD. Overall it looks like TP-Link &quot;routers&quot; have a shell life of about 1 year. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />.
