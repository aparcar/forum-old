The trailing blank in the DNS server list managed it into configuration. I haven&#039;t checked but my experience is that there are no checks at all.

					<p>If you&#039;re serious about filing any bugs I think you should try to clarify what you&#039;re talking about. For me OpenWRT UI is the uci for example. Version/build info would also help imho.</p><p>Good luck with creating a bug.</p>									</div>
