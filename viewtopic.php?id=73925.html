					<p>double O seven reporting for duty....</p><br /><p>just to make things going on by reporting some issues.....<br />three support requests :</p><br /><p>##1</p><p>it&#039;s an old one i know but im now running experciences on DG834GT from Netgear, it&#039;s running well attitude adjustment, with filename :<br /><a href="http://archive.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/brcm63xx/generic/openwrt-DG834GT_DG834PN-squashfs-cfe.bin">http://archive.openwrt.org/attitude_adj … fs-cfe.bin</a><br />booting well...</p><br /><p>doing the same thing to have a faster openwrt (att/adj is running slow enough) with the beloved backfire :<br /><a href="http://archive.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm63xx/openwrt-DG834GT_DG834PN-squashfs-cfe.bin">http://archive.openwrt.org/backfire/10. … fs-cfe.bin</a></p><p>freeezing on <br />VFS: Cannot open root device &quot;mtdblock2&quot; or unknown-block(0,0)<br />Please append a correct &quot;root=&quot; boot option; here are the available partitions:<br />Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)</p><p>entire log for BB :<br /><a href="https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/QBqAuWb3HFldz~EZRh4G1Q/raw">https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/Q … Rh4G1Q/raw</a></p><br /><br /><p>##2</p><p>two other things :<br />for people like me who prefer use our beloved openwrt version instead of the latest for personal and legitimate reasons (yes, it&#039;s legitimated to use old windows, old osx or&nbsp; old linuxes too) is it possible to differentiate generated images with the release/version?</p><p>as example, for this model :<br /><a href="http://archive.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm63xx/generic/openwrt-F5D7633-squashfs-cfe.bin">http://archive.openwrt.org/barrier_brea … fs-cfe.bin</a><br /><a href="http://archive.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/brcm63xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-brcm63xx-generic-F5D7633-squashfs-cfe.bin">http://archive.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer … fs-cfe.bin</a></p><p>the F5D7633 (example to illustrate the problem) has two very similar filenames and when you see them... you just cannot know on which openwrt version the file is. And it&#039;s a problem (yes, users are here for reporting that, <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; )</p><br /><p>##3</p><p>and the latest (ok, that makes three) issue :<br />how to make wget supporting ssl ?<br />i absolutely need wget with ssl support to send data to an hotspot, i have <br />wget: not an http or ftp url</p><p>how could i solve that?</p><br /><p>thank you very much for reading (and replying <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> )</p>									</div>

The thing is att/adj is generating a working image for that device, instead of the backfire, without any change, doesnt launch, even when trying the official generated on downloads.openwrt.org servers.</p><p>there is why i&#039;m wondering : how could be possible to update the backfire or let a file to explain how to fix it? we can&#039;t let this unbelievable bug stay here, available to so much people whom want to try backfire on their netgear for a little tiny hotspot as example...</p><p>thank you again for answers and how-to fix it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m thinking the problem may be in your bootloader config not passing a complete command line to the kernel-- not a problem in the build itself.&nbsp; But I know very little about CFE / Broadcom bootup.&nbsp; You could search for a post of the bootlog of a successful bootup of this model, and pay attention to the kernel command line and the MTD partitioning.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 24 Apr 2018, 03:35)</p>
