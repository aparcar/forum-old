					<p>Routers with built-in DSL modems typically use either Texas Instruments or Broadcom chipsets. Support for the Broadcom ones in OpenWRT is VERY experimental, but USB and wi-fi may be expected to work with some effort. The TI ones have been known to work well in OpenWRT for quite some time, but USB and wi-fi support are both broken right now.</p>									</div>
