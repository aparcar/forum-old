					<p>Hi guys - I&#039;m not new to open-source firmware, but I am a relative newbie to OpenWRT. My main router runs DD-WRT, but I have a second router with no DD-WRT firmware available for it. I installed OpenWRT on it quite awhile ago and am looking to upgrade the firmware I have on it now.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Airlink101 AR670W and it currently running OpenWRT Chaos Calmer 15.05.1. Can anybody suggest the firmware version I can get to install directly from that previous version of OpenWRT?</p><p>Thanks so much! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dagleykd</strong> on 24 Mar 2018, 21:24)</p>

					<p>Thank you very much! With the recent merger of OpenWRT and LEDE (which is news to me considering I haven&#039;t been here in like 3 years!), I wasn&#039;t sure where the newest update for my router was - much appreciated! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Last question - there are two files in the link you&#039;ve sent, do I need to use both, or do I only need the &#039;upgrade&#039; file if I am upgrading from a previous version of OpenWRT?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dagleykd</strong> on 24 Mar 2018, 21:26)</p>
