					<p>Hello,</p><p>I set up another user next to root on my OpenWRT router. I wanted it to act as a monitoring user for different traffic routing. I routed the specific traffic for the user like this:</p><p>iptables -t mangle -N TUNMARK<br />iptables -t mangle -A TUNMARK -j MARK --set-mark 2<br />iptables -t mangle -A TUNMARK -j CONNMARK --save-mark<br />iptables -t mangle -N RESTOREMARK<br />iptables -t mangle -A RESTOREMARK -j CONNMARK --restore-mark<br />iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p TCP -m state --state NEW -m owner --uid-owner 1001 -j TUNMARK<br />iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p TCP -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -m owner --uid-owner 1001 -j RESTOREMARK</p><p>Where 1001 is the uid of that user.</p><p>But when I ssh with that user, I cannot use any kind of tools like ping, traceroute or mtr, because it seems just root can use them on an OpenWRT build:</p><p>ping: permission denied (are you root?)</p><p>How can I fix this without messing up the whole system or creat security leaks? Is there a better way doing this maybe?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 1 Oct 2013, 22:40)</p>

					<p>Hello, thanks a lot for your answer, it doesnt happen often you get a get answer here, so thanks a lot for taking the time.</p><p>I am not a Linux pro, so I didnt know that. I read myself just into what &quot;setuid&quot; is, and what it does. And I now understand, that ping, tracroute and also mtr requiers t be run as root, because they need some raw socket access if I understand it right, thought I dont know why only root this can do.</p><p>So my problem wouldnt be solved with sudo, I also installed it btw on my router and tried it out. Of course it&#039;s no use for my problem, because it will me just let run these tools under other users, but always as root.</p><p>Maybe I should have had asked the topic differently, heres what I wanted to do, like I also wrote about:</p><p>I have two VPN connections on my router, tun0 and tun1. Also two ISP connections, one over the WAN port of my router, connected to a cable modem, and the other via NAT of another router.</p><p>So I want to be able to use ping/mtr/traceroute of all 4 connections. How do I do this, if they all run as root and I cant mangle them this way? Ping works fine if used for the tun devices via -i tun0/1, default always is wan, but I have no way of forcing the traffic through the 4th connection which uses an SNAT. How do I do this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually br-lan is the 4th case, which isnt working. ping -I tun0/tun1/eth1 works fine. But doing a ping -I br-lan results in the problem waiting for a receive and nothing happens. My config for this 4th case is:</p><p>ip rule add fwmark 4 table vpn3<br />ip route add default via 192.168.1.2 dev br-lan table vpn3<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o br-lan -j SNAT --to 192.168.1.1<br />iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.1.11 -j MARK --set-mark 4</p><p>Where 1.11 is a client behind the router. This works without any problem. But how would I be able to use the 1.2 NAT on the router itself? ping -I br-lan ... doesnt work.</p><p>192.168.1.2 is the other router, 192.168.1.1 is br-lan on th OpenWRT router. 192.168.1.11 is a client behind the OpenWRT router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 5 Oct 2013, 18:29)</p>

					<p>You can also cheat and designate a remote IP as being your &quot;1.2 test IP&quot; and add it to the main routing table.

					<p>No, I mean, 4.2.2.1 is the *destination*. Because basic routing works by looking at the destination.

					<p>You don&#039;t want a separate interface.. you want a way to tell the kernel that you want certain packets to go to a certain gateway, different from the default.</p><p>Did you try to get a full-featured ping and then &#039;ping -m 4&#039;?</p><p>Edit: on IRC, send me a private message and I&#039;ll reply when I&#039;m around.

					<p>Please just tell me how to do this &quot;but how do I route all traffic now initiated FROM tap1 &lt;-&gt; to GO OVER the other router?&quot;, how to set a gw for a specific interface.</p><p>I am not getting another ping, I wouldnt even know where and how to compile it than for mips, because like I said I dont want to use ping. And like I said, I tried several hours to open a DCC chat with you, you never accepted. But anyway, dcc chats never worked for me, I think you have to open a port for them to work or something.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knuddel</strong> on 6 Oct 2013, 22:12)</p>

					<p>You can&#039;t initiate traffic &quot;from&quot; tap1 - either the traffic is from some other machine connected on tap1, or the traffic is from the local machine. &quot;ping -I tap1&quot; means to generate traffic from the local machine and send it *out* on tap1.</p><p>I think it would help if you looked at the way Linux handles network traffic. Here is a good diagram:<br /><a href="http://www.cs.unh.edu/cnrg/people/gherrin/linux-net.html#tth_sEc2.1">http://www.cs.unh.edu/cnrg/people/gherr … tth_sEc2.1</a></p><p>In the &quot;Application generates network traffic&quot; you need to somehow mark the traffic so that the &quot;Looks up route destination&quot; looks at that mark and chooses a specific destination. &quot;ping -I tun0&quot; is one way, and says to always send the traffic *out* on tun0. &quot;ping -m 4&quot; is another way, which means to place a fwmark on the application traffic, and then in the lookup, look at the fwmark and choose a destination.</p><p>Try adding a default gateway on br-lan with a higher metric than the default gateway on eth1. Then by default traffic should still go on eth1 but you might be able to chose br-lan using &quot;-I br-lan&quot;. But you said you don&#039;t want to use ping or mtr, so does the application that you really want to use have a -I flag?</p><p>You need to do more debugging and trials on your own. While pinging, start &quot;tcpdump&quot; on br-lan and eth1 and see on which interface packets are going out. Adjust the routing tables. Try deleting the default gateway on eth1 and send all traffic through br-lan.</p><p>Sorry about the DCC chat, like I said, send me a private message or on #openwrt and I will reply when I am on IRC. If our time zones don&#039;t match, there&#039;s not much I can do about that..</p>									</div>
