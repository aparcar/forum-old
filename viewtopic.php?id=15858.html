					<p>Hello,</p><p>In the wiki (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration/WiFiEncryption">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam â€¦ Encryption</a>) it says that one should only use alphanumeric combo for wpa/wpa2 key, however I tried a string of random printable ascii chars (excluding &#039; because config file uses &#039;key&#039; format to store key) and seems to work too. <br />It used to work on official Asus WL-500gP firmware too, even with &#039;, so I am unsure where the problem is and why that wiki recommendation stands.</p><p>Is it ok to use random printable ascii char key or there are some other reasons why I should restrict myself to using &quot;simpler&quot; alphanumeric string? (since it&#039;s just my home AP for personal use, I use 63 characters key)</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s safe to stay with the recommendation. My guess is since the configuration might be read by shell scripts they could interpret the key string.&nbsp; If by chance it looks something like &quot;fre2t23re${var}sedfd..&quot;, the ${var} may be replaced with nothing and your key doesn&#039;t work anymore.</p>									</div>

In principle all printable characters are usable, but they need to be escaped. The openwrt maintainers documented it in a way to minimize problems. If you think it&#039;s a bug, open a ticket on <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org">https://dev.openwrt.org</a>/.</p><p>PinkBunny: If you want to use more characters, make sure you escape the ones that get interpreted by the shell, like &quot;, {, } and $.</p>									</div>
