					<p>Hello,<br />I would like ask, what exactly mean these words from wiki OpenWRT ?</p><p>The factory bootloader (RouterBOOT) and firmware (RouterOS) do not provide any console output, making it difficult to develop an OpenWrt image that works with factory firmware installer (NetInstall). <br />It is rb750gr3 site.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/mikrotik/mikrotik_rb750gr3">https://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/mikrotik â€¦ k_rb750gr3</a></p><p>Mainly these<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>The easiest, and (currently) only way to install OpenWrt is to flash a full flash image with U-Boot to the SPI flash chip.</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>The factory bootloader program in this model doesn&#039;t let you change anything.&nbsp; So you need to open the case and use a hardware SPI programmer to take direct control of the flash chip, and write a new bootloader directly into the chip.&nbsp; Once this has been done you can then re-flash the OS in the usual way.</p>									</div>

					<p>A Bus Pirate could be used here, it is slow but you only have to do this once.&nbsp; </p><p>The main thing is to figure out how to hold the router CPU in reset so it doesn&#039;t try to drive the flash chip at the same time.&nbsp; Or you can temporarily disconnect the pins of the chip that are driven by the CPU.</p>									</div>
