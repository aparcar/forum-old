					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Foneram for la fonera+, aka FON2201 is available here : <a href="http://www.moliets-bastide.info/post/FONERAM">http://www.moliets-bastide.info/post/FONERAM</a></p><p>It&#039;s just an ELF file format you can load from RedBoot, and then run Kamikaze 7.06 (kernel 2.6.19.2) from RAM.<br />This is NOT a firmware to flash ! Just a way to boot OpenWRT on your device without reflashing. After a reboot your foneraplus is still intact.<br />Entering RedBoot console is the only way to run foneram.</p><br /><p>Features in few lines:<br />- boot is very fast: 1 to 2 minutes, and safe because no reflashing needed.<br />- your fonera+ will boot as a classic router wifi-AP with routed internet access if connected to your main router on WAN ethernet port.<br />&nbsp; Connect via WEP encrypted WiFi or LAN port, SSH or telnet. Root password and WEP key --&gt; serial number of the foneraplus.<br />- you can mount squashfs and JFFS FON partitions<br />- CIFS is supported to mount remote ressources and perform full backups of flash contents. <br />- test the last release of X-WRT WebifÂ² (script &quot;instwebif&quot;)<br />- customize your version of foneram by script at boot: add your files, modify some paramaters...</p><br /><br /><p>The post is very long, sorry !&nbsp; Lot of warnings !<br />Perhaps printing the doc may help.<br />Don&#039;t plan to perform all described operations in 10 minutes. <br />Just take the necesary time you need to understand what you can do with foneram.</p><br /><p>Foneram was compiled from OpenWRT SVN with some mods.<br />Thanks to davidel, OpenWRT, FON for the hardware, and enjoy Foneram.<br />Just hope this dev will help some guys to unbrick their boxes or have a better look on the system.</p><br /><p>LamaBleu</p>									</div>
