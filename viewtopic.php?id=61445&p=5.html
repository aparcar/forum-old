Once you are down to argue that HooToo could not have meant what they responded to your email and insinuating that being caused by their representatives limited english it is clear to every bystander in the audience that you have painted yourself into a corner... Not accepting reality is one thing, but making the audience will follow in and act of suspension of disbelieve requires ,ore elaborate and sophisticated arguments than you seem wiling to make. </p><p>Tl;dr.
