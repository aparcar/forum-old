					<p>Well, I&#039;ve acquired a Linksys WRT54GX2, and the only thing I don&#039;t want on it is the stock firmware. I&#039;d really, really like openwrt on here.</p><p>Some specs for those that are interested: <br />RTL8651B processor<br />32megabits ROM - unsure of ram amount<br />Airgo AGN102BB wireless card</p><p>So, since there doesn&#039;t seem to be any progress here on this device, I figure I&#039;d offer to help - though I must warn you, my only embedded experience is in developing <a href="http://www.polypux.org">Poly-p-ux</a>, a linux distribution for 3, 4, and 586&#039;s. But I digress...</p><p>Anyway, the first thing I thought I&#039;d do was try to get a serial console going to see bootloader messages - this board has a nice serail header (the same one as the WRT54GXv2 (a different board), operating at 3.3v. However, I don&#039;t have any sort of converting device for voltage - so I only connected TX -&gt; RX, RX -&gt; TX and GND -&gt; GND. Running microcom on my old 486 or 586 (my newest box has no serial port, and my other box is using its serial port), I get a bunch of junk data, though it seems to be following a pattern that suggests that it&#039;s outputting something.</p><p>Do I need a voltage converter, or is what I&#039;m doing correct (and another, possibly software setting is wrong)?</p><p>What else can I do to help the efforts to get linux on this fine router?</p><p>poly-p man</p>									</div>
