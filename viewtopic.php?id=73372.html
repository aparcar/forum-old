					<p>Hi there, I tried to follow this guide here&nbsp; wiki.openwrt.o rg/toh/tp-link/tp-link_archer_c20_1&nbsp; and was able to flash my router, I could get an IP from DHCP and could connect to it via ssh but there was no web control page, it displayed just a blank &#039;index of&#039; page as if it was serving an empty folder.</p><p>So I tried flashing again and nothing changed. Then I thought I could just flash the original back and download it from here Archer_C20(BR)_V1_160815_1477622903943f_1478197164394h.zip from tplink.</p><p>After flashing it the router just turned off, when I turn it on then one single blue led lights up and then off again and so all leds remains turned off. I&#039;m assuming I just bricked the darn thing.</p><p>I read that I need to desolder something and connect as serial, can someone help me with the instructions so I can try to recover it?</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>									</div>

					<p>O que é sem lici? Eu peguei o que deveria ser o firmware original. Ele liga e já desliga as luzes e fica todo preto, sem dar sinal de vida, como eu faria para conectar por ssh, ele tem um ip padrão? Pq agora por dhcp ele não pega mais IP.</p><p>EDIT: What does is it mean without &#039;lici&#039;? I got what should be the original firmware. It turns on and then turns off and stays with all leds black, no sign of &#039;life&#039;. How would I connect to it via ssh, it does have a default ip? Because the dhcp isn&#039;t working anymore.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tiagocc0</strong> on 25 Feb 2018, 11:25)</p>
