					<p>I want to describe all my steps to make my WT1520 a perfect brick. As yo can read down I think my WT1520 was bricked due a bad flash trying to return from Padavan WT1520_3.4.3.9-097.trx firmware to original Nexx firmware NEXX_WT1520H_V1.15_2014011618_upgrade.bin . I have read how to solder wires in RX,TX and GND pads in WT1520 board, so I did it. Then uses a usbtoserial converter to connect it to a terminal program, and as many others have described here, I obtained a response at the serial console. This was the common 9 options countdown response that ever run as default the option 3: Boot system code via Flash (default). I tried 1 and 2 options with no luck. It ever ends with a TTTTTT waiting for the file. The 4 option gives poor options due to the fact that only gives a manual access to the pre-build options 1 to 9. The only option that seems to work was 7. So I decide to change bootloader for a more friendly one, with web based support, the breed-mt7620-reset11.bin file was the selected. I proceed to charge using serial, the charge was perfect and ends with Done. But was a complete disaster, the led light becomes ON full time, and the serial output gone away, no more terminal access was available. I was tried to do many reset tweaks, with time pushing reset and power/reset combinations, but no luck. Now my only option may be to use GPIO solder points an uses it as a JTAG way to recover the item. I have done years ago with my DSL504T router, so I have a Xilinx Jtag paralell port device, but I need to know the GPIO exact equivalence to the leads of my Xilinx Jtag. Then with the proper mtd0 file and the flasher utility, sure I can back to life the wt1520.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>aestradarespeto wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>loderunner84 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>fix it. by usb-uart connect and make firstboot. thanks for this thread!</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi, I have bricked my WT1520F due to try to return to original firmware.
