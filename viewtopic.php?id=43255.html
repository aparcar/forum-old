					<p>Hej,</p><p>I&#039;ve the following problem: I want to configure my router settings using OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1. The problem is that I&#039;m not sure with the password, because when I insert my username and password (I&#039;m not 100% sure if it is right but ca. 80% :-)) I only see a blank white screen. If I use a wrong password I do get an error message but with the password what I think is the right one I only see a white screen. </p><p>kschrader</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve just had exactly the same problem, changing browsers/clearing caches al yielded the same result (white screen after entering credentials). Let me describe my situation in a little bit more detail:</p><p>I&#039;m running a &quot;stock&quot; (just downloaded the image of openwrt ( Backfire (10.03.1, r29592) on my wdr3700v2 ) and configured the device with ip-settings etc (through luci).</p><p>Then, I changed the password (whilst logged onto the system through ssh). After that I could no longer log onto the system with luci. After entering my credentials just a white page appeared. Running the binary on the cli just gave me the &quot;regular&quot; http output.</p><p>After powering off/on the system some times and starting reading a while on your forum I established that I hadn&#039;t installed additional software etc, just changed a lot of default settings (ssid&#039;s,passwords/passpharses,ips and the like).</p><p>Just before commencing a re-flash to the image I downloaded from the openwrt servers I decided to alter the root password &quot;through&quot; ssh to exactly the password I set to the Luci admin page. This solved my predicament instantly (no restart required or anything).</p><p>Anyway: hope this helps somebody out.</p><p>cheers</p>									</div>
