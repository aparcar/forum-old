					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have just bought ASUS WL500Gp router and now i`m thinking about good firmware for it as original FW is realy useless. So, i`d like to try OpenWrt. However before i do that, i want to make sure that OpenWrt can be easily configured for my requirements.</p><p>Here is list of requirements:</p><p>1) GUI (webif). I`m not an expert in Linux, just know few commands and i think i won`t configure router using command line only.</p><p>2) Telnet and SSH. </p><p>3) Set MAC on WAN interface manually.</p><p>4) DHCP on LAN interface with STATIC DHCP function for the clients. I need to assign fixed IP addresses for two LAN clients, but they must be in only automatic DHCP mode. Otherwise those devices won`t work properly. Other clients - just standard DHCP with dynamically assigned IP addresses.</p><p>5) USB HDD support.</p><p>6) SAMBA for LAN WinXP clients.</p><p>7) NFS for LAN Linux clients.</p><p>Is it possible to use all listed above functions with WhiteRussian firmware? <br />Is it very difficult to set all required parameters in WhiteRussian if i`m not an expert (very basic linux skills)?</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>									</div>
