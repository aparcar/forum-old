					<p>Your on the right track, but my problem is I don&#039;t know the IP address they will give me.&nbsp; I also need a separate MAC for each DHCP client connection.</p><p>I think what I need is to create 3 virtual interfaces to the one physical interface if that is possible.&nbsp; I am new to this so have no idea how to implement this, but I am sure others have this same problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>Still working on trying to get 3 IP addresses via DHCP from my &quot;RoadRunner&quot; cable connection.&nbsp; After doing some reading it appears that I probably need to use the &quot;client identifier&quot; to contain the MAC address and define 3 connections (eth0:1, 0:2, 0:3) on my WAN interface.&nbsp; Am I the only one who would like to get more than one IP from my cable company or has someone already modified their router for multiple client ID&#039;s?</p>									</div>
