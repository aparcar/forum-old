					<p>@david<br />Yes stability is good for me on the 5GHz wireless. No dropouts so far. There were 2 Netflix streaming devices running all evening without any issues such as pauses or disconnects so is looking good. Had a total of 6 devices on 5GHz and 6 devices, yes good old 2.4. I also ran my iperf test on the 5GHz wireless. Client is a Windows 10 Pro with Asus USB-AC56. Server is Windows 10 Pro Gig Ethernet connected to the wrt1900acs. Ran the iperf3 test for 1 hour and when reviewing the output it was pretty steady, no dips. </p><p>So unless something changes, which I do not expect, this build looks good on my wrt1900acs. As I said I will update if I have any issues.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks again for your work on getting us, none compilers, a great firmware. I do run other firmware just to see how well they are doing, but come back to either you or ispyisial&#039;s Gargoyle which runs really well on the wrt1900acs. He is running the previous wireless driver and gives very good performance in my case. Was running Gargoyle when your build had the WAN MAC issue. Brainslayer has redesigned his wireless support and now his last two builds have run very well, BUT I always come back to LEDE and especially yours. I do not know what it is, probably just in my head, but I prefer your builds over cybrnook&#039;s. Don&#039;t have issues when running his just feels different, which of course it really is not. </p><p>--bill</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 16 Mar 2017, 19:29)</p>

					<p>I am one of the folks causing confusion. David provided me with a 4.9 kernel build to try on my wrt1900acs v1 as I was having issues with doing a custom MAC on the WAN interface. The 4.9 kernel build has been rock solid so far, up for almost a day. </p><p>Yes from everything I read the wrt3200acm has stability issues on 5GHz no matter what you are running. Marvell is supposed to be close to releasing a new wireless driver, hopefully at the end of March. The wrt1900acs v1 I have is rock solid on any build I run on it,David&#039;s LEDE, Openwrt, Gargoyle, Brainslayer&#039;s latest DD-WRT. Have had issues with Kong&#039;s latest DD-WRT.&nbsp; The wrt1900acs seems to be the sweet spot for wrt support right now. Shame as the wrt3200acm has such great hardware specs, but very poor support from Belkin/Linksy/Marvell&nbsp; to the 3rd party devs. Support they give the 3rd party devs they should not be advertising the wrt line as Openwrt/DD-WRT ready IMHO.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bill1228</strong> on 16 Mar 2017, 23:14)</p>
