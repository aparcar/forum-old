					<p>Just trying to make sure : your TX and RX wires are connected to pins 1 and 5 of the PL2303 chip ?&nbsp; Inspect it by sight, or measure resistance again in the points. I believe you are using the continuity/diode test of the multimeter, that usually beeps. Under 50ohm isn´t the same as direct connection . If there is no other component in the way, you should encounter one or two ohms ( approximately the same as when you touch the probes of multimeter to each other ) .</p><p>Also, if you can post some clear detailed photos of the adapter board Try taking them in sunlight with some macro setting in the camera / cell phone.</p>									</div>

					<p>According to datasheet of PL2303HX and with multimeter beeps I found Tx, RX, GND. When I put multimeter&#039;s probe to TX of PL2303HX it beeps to TX pin on PCB pinout and the same with GND and RX. I use a magnifier to see solder joints and seems that they are good.

					<p>I still insist : Find the dot that indicates pin 1 of the chip. Is that one of the pins you connected as RX/TX ? Counting from that same pin, find pin 5.

					<p>That is exactly what I did and I test with beep mode and with resistance I am 100% sure about the identity of pins. So I found dot and according datasheet of PL2303HX I found on chip which pins are TX, RX and GND and with multimeter beeps and resistance found them.&nbsp; What about test it in linux like BackTrack ?

					<p>I may be sounding harsh, but when I try to help I expect people to follow instructions.&nbsp; Maybe it is just my way of thinking or lack of patience. Either way, I understand there is a difference in language, and sometimes what we want to say is not transferred correctly to the other person.</p><p>I never talked about datasheets, I asked specifically about pins 1 and 5. But if you look and saw that is correct, and you know that your solder is good, my next suggestion is to throw that adapter in the trash and buy a new one. There are others, with pins correctly identified, for under US$ 5 in ebay. Or you can search for a cellphone cable. Search for the models recommended&nbsp; in the forums. I know for sure the Nokia one works, but have bought one from dx.com and it worked ok also.</p><p>Anyway, if you have that MAX3232 cable working , you can use that for working with routers. The USB one is just an addition to the toolbox, but not imprescindible.</p>									</div>
