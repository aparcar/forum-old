					<p>After figuring out what I&#039;d broken trying to get any kind of IPSec VPN up and running, I&#039;ve encountered a new problem - IPSec seems to authenticate nicely, but I don&#039;t get any data going through. If I&#039;m on the router itself, I can ping the client device, so there is some kind of connectivity, suggesting a routing issue. Sadly, I haven&#039;t been able to resolve it yet.</p><p>The configuration is as such:<br />The WAN side is a /29 subnet, with the router at x.y.z.70. Connectivity to the outside is provided over PPPoE.<br />StrongSwan is bound to x.y.z.68, and an alias &quot;ppoe-wan:0&quot; is created with this IP address - otherwise this IP isn&#039;t available for StrongSwan. Firewall rules are in place to permit connectivity for IKE/ESP to this address.</p><p>StrongSwan configuration looks like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config setup

conn %default
 keyexchange=ikev2
 auto=add

conn roadwarrior
 left=vpn.changed.me
 leftauth=pubkey
 leftcert=gatewayCert.pem
 leftid=vpn.changed.me
 leftsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
 leftfirewall=yes
 right=%any
 rightsourceip=192.168.249.0/24
 rightauth=pubkey

 ike=aes-aes256-sha-modp1024,aes256-sha512-modp4096</code></pre></div><p>I want to be able to set up OpenWRT so an external device can VPN and have access to both internal network resources and the Internet at the same time. This is due to the other end of the link being on potentially hostile networks.</p><p>What routing magic am I missing with this?</p>									</div>
