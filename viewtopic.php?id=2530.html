					<p>Has anyone had any luck getting WallWatcher to querry OpenWRT via snmp (for bandwith reporting)? I have snmpd installed and configured, but when I go into WallWatcher&#039;s bandwith setup screen and select &quot;Test snmp&quot; I get this error:</p><p>Your router did not respond to this test, or didn&#039;t provide the expected information. Some possible reasons:</p><p>WW has the wrong LAN address for the router (I know this is not the issue as I am receiving router messages)</p><p>The low-order digit of the OID&#039;s for &#039;RECEIVED&#039; and &#039;SENT&#039; may be wrong (most likely the problem)</p><p>Your software firewall may be blocking this type of communication between WW and the router (turned it off, but the problem persisted)</p><p>The router may not support SNMP, or the bandwith usage portion of SNMP (possible the bandwith usage portion)</p><p>The router&#039;s SNMP option has not been enabled (verified snmpd was loaded with ps)</p><p>One thing I did try is that I noticed that WallWatcher defaults to port 514 for Linksys routers. A little resarch showed that snmpd defaults to port 161 so I went back and loaded snmpd with a 514 port option, but no luck. WW uses the following default OID&#039;s:</p><p>Up Time: 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0<br />Received: 1.3.6.1.2.2.1.10.8<br />Sent: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.8</p><p>Does anyone happen to know what theses OID&#039;s are for the snmpd implementation for OpenWRT, or is there a MIB walker available for OpenWRT so I can look them up myself?</p><p>TIA,<br />Jon</p>									</div>

					<p>Well,<br />I guess I have a config issue with snmpd. The reason I say this is that I found a MIB Walker, but it can not connect to OpenWRT at all. I tried setting it for SNMP versions 1,2, and 3 and it barfed on all of them. Does anyone know of some good documentation for configuring snmpd?</p><p>TIA,<br />Jon</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah Ha,<br />I finally got the MIB Browser working with snmpd and OpenWRT. My problem with snmpd and WallWatcher is with the OID&#039;s. While <br />Up Time: 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 is correct, both Received: 1.3.6.1.2.2.1.10.8 and Sent: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.8 are not (at least not for snmpd). With the MIB browser Iwas able to determine that Received should be: 1.3.6.1.2.2.1.10.2 and Sent should be: 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.2. After making these changes, WallWatcher is polling bandwith usage perfectly.</p><p>Jon</p>									</div>
