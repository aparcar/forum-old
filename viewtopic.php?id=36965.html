					<p>Hello, I have a NanoStation Loco M5.</p><p>It currently has firmware ubiquiti.</p><p>Is it possible to do this?:</p><p>Through serial connection, loaded into ram (not write) and access the ubiquitin system and modify files.</p><p>I want to modify the file &quot;/ etc / passwd&quot; because my ISP changed the password and would like to have a configuration file in case I want to install openwrt and then return to ubiquitin. I also want to because I paid for this unit is my property.</p><p>Or Can I make full flash backup in serial console?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>glixen</strong> on 21 May 2012, 04:28)</p>
