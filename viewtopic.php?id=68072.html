					<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve managed to build OpenWrt successfully for the Lantiq XRX200 profile, however it doesn&#039;t seem to generate an image for the BT Home Hub V5A.</p><p>I&#039;ve reviewed the Git history and it looks like the BT Home Hub V5A was moved into a &#039;legacy&#039; section, but I can&#039;t figure out which options will make it build for legacy devices.</p><p>Could someone point me in the right direction?</p><p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure why it was moved to legacy. But you can definitely build an image for it in LEDE, I have done it just few days ago. The compatibility between openwrt and LEDE is still good so you should not have any issues no matter what you want to do with the router later.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve just cloned the LEDE source and can see the HH5 as an option in the profile section.</p><p>Strange that it doesn&#039;t appear as an option in menuconfig for OpenWrt. There must still be a way though as they took the time to move it to the legacy section.</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
