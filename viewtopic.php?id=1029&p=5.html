					<p>Greetings,</p><p>Sveasoft seems to descending into a deep bunker for a long stay, so I&#039;m moving over here thanks to my affection for the GPL.

I see there&#039;s a &quot;wlc&quot; command available, but it does not seem to offer much in the way of state queries. Is wl temporarily missing from OpenWRT, or is the absence of &quot;wl&quot; a design decision and if so is it envisioned that wlc will eventually offer error counts, rssi, etc?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tetrode</strong> on 20 Apr 2005, 04:00)</p>

					<p>Where can I go to read about how the experimental software differs from the mainstream?</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Linksys WRT54GS version 1.1, so I&#039;ve got to use the experimental version of the software.&nbsp; However, much of the documentation revolves around the original.&nbsp; Just as an example, I expect all my executables to be linked to /rom, and to make a change I just remove the link and bring in a new package.&nbsp; Or something along those lines- I haven&#039;t worked out the details and that&#039;s not the point.</p><p>The point is that /rom is empty.&nbsp; Except for one file, note, that says &quot;After firstboot has been run, /rom will contain the previous (squashfs) root&quot;&nbsp; So I assume that firstboot hasn&#039;t been run and I run it.&nbsp; No dice.&nbsp; Firstboot has already been run.</p><p>So what gives?&nbsp; Oh I&#039;m using the jffs filesystem, not the squashfs system.&nbsp; Not really sure what the advantage of one over the other is.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s squashfs that fills /rom?&nbsp; If so, maybe the note file should be different for the two versions?</p><br /><p>Anyway, I&#039;m thinking that this has something to do with the differences between the standard build and the experimental build but I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to do some reading, but if there&#039;s a summary document that would be a better place to start than reading all the history for every thread with the word &quot;experimental&quot; in it.&nbsp; In fact, the history is a little dangerous because things have clearly changed along the way, and some of the information is no longer accurate.</p><p>But this is meant to be a request for where I should do some work, not a complaint about the state of the documentation.&nbsp; I hope it doesn&#039;t come across that way.</p><p>The experimental build *works*.&nbsp; That&#039;s absolutely delightful.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to tinkering with it and Im&#039; very grateful to all of you who have helped put this on the table.</p><p>Narrowband</p>									</div>
