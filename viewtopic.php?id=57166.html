					<p>Hi everybody, I&#039;m having trouble setting a repeater, and I&#039;m a total noobster on the matter, and after 3 hours of cruising the wiki I really don&#039;t know what else to do but to cry for help.<br />I&#039;m trying to extend my wifi to get to my smart tv, but the router given to me by the ISP is crap. Just so happens I had my old TP-Link MR 3420 v2 still, and poking around Google I learned I could use OpenWrt to turn it into a strong repeater.<br />I already installed the image and downloaded all needed files, and then I tried using both of the following guides:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a><br />but in both cases, when I&#039;m done with the config the router blocks and I have to shut it down and turn it back on again. Whenever I do that, everything I just did is undone, and I have to start over from the very beggining (using Telnet to set a password).<br />I really don&#039;t know what am I doing wrong, I know it&#039;s probably some dumb error but I lack the knowledge to spot it. Could you please give me a hand?<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
