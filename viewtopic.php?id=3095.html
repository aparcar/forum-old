					<p>The short of it: I&#039;m trying to get hold of the original (v4.12-UK) firmware for the above linksys &#039;modem&#039; OR advice on my problem:</p><p>(UK based btw)</p><p>Was using Zen Internet ADSL fine using the &quot;Bridged Only Mode&quot; option on the modem, which means it takes PPPoE packets and converts/tunnels via PPPoA (which all UK ADSL suppliers use)</p><p>This was all working fine untill I decided to move to freedom2surf&#039;s 8meg LLU (via easyNet iirc) - the migration happened on friday. When I got back from work the migration appeared to have happened, and once I&#039;d found the login details i tried it - no joy! </p><p>The modem had a DSL sync fine, however it would just not get a PPP link, setting the modem into bridge mode and using pppd with debug mode enabled, it appeared that as soon as the ppp link was actualy established, it got disconnected from the other end.</p><p>Anyway, after hours of googling I decided to try flashing the firmware - except... (wait for it...) there aren&#039;t any offical firmware versions on any of the linksys&#039; sites that I could see. so anyway I found a version that claimed to be 4.19UK, and it had two files: upgrade.this.first.360c.bin and LKS...419.img</p><p>Anyway, I applied both patches and lo and behold - I can get a PPP link to stay up! Sadly only when the modem was doing the PPPoA link itself, when it was in bridged mode (i.e. the mode where the modem behaves as an actual modem, rather than a router with no port forwards) it seems to just ignore the pppoe packets coming from my linux box.</p><p>So I see my options as this:</p><p>- Get a new modem (prolly not another one of same model)<br />- Install OpenWrt/AR7Port (whats the status of this?)<br />- Nasty hack with iptables on the router (possibly also using dhcp-fwd)<br />- Hope someone (joseangel?) has a copy of the original 4.12 firmware<br />- something else i&#039;ve missed?</p><br /><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Slayeh</strong> on 31 Oct 2005, 01:25)</p>

					<p>Sorry, did not notice you sent me a PM. Sure you can get my spanish version (I guess it works in the UK). We can solve this on the private messaging.</p><p>On the other hand, as an user and waiting for a developer to give you an answer, I have my ADSL2MUE running Openwrt Port and works nicely. USB is unsupported and I had to add br2684 routed mode support (got it from linux-atm forums I just did integrate it into our source tree more or less successfully) but I made it work as a bridge and as a router.</p><p>But my suggestion would be to stay with the original firmware by now (do not forget to come back to get AR7Port when finished) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
