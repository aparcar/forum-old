					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to run a VPN client on my router so all devices connecting with the router will be automatically connect to the internet through the VPN server.</p><p>For this I have an old Linksys WRT54G v5 router (2MB flash, 8MB RAM) that I hope to use. I already installed Open WRT Micro White Russian (openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx) on it (without webinterface). I&#039;m connecting and configuring the router via SSH but it&#039;s quite hard to find the right commands because most information about this old firmware can&#039;t be accessed anymore.</p><p>The router will be connected to my main router in my local network and apart from it being a VPN client no other functions are important to me. So WiFi and the firewall and such can all be deleted (can I remove them manually to make space?).</p><p>If the only problem is space I can solder an SD card in the router as explained here, if that would solve anything:<br /><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT54G-TM_SD/MMC_mod">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Li â€¦ SD/MMC_mod</a></p><p>The White Russian packages can be found at the link below however I can&#039;t find a VPN client in there:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/packages/</a></p><p>Can anyone tell me whether it is possible at all with this old router with low flash and RAM what I want?</p><p>I hope to hear from you!</p><p>Cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s probably better to buy an new US$50-class router or a Raspberry Pi to do what you want rather than fight that WRT54Gv5. If you&#039;re looking for security, the main-line packages are already outdated; I can&#039;t imagine how many security patches the ones from White Russian are missing.</p><p>I&#039;m a little confused as well, as I thought the v5 was not a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start#linksys">supported device</a> for OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>True, but it&#039;s not about security for me, I want to connect to a multicast IPTV stream from somewhere else, but I&#039;m not even sure if that works over VPN so I figured if I can test this out without too much costs I&#039;ll give it a go. Buying a new router for something that might not work seems like a big waste.</p><p>Oh and to get Open WRT to work on the v5 I found this, and it works:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12745">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=12745</a></p><p>Thanks for the response though <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jant90</strong> on 16 Apr 2013, 19:13)</p>
