					<p>hi to everybody.</p><p>I&#039;ve got a router (model in subject) from my friend and he said that he was having some fun on it. It runs openWRT firmware (luci) and he forgot password and username.</p><p>At first I&#039;ve tryed to do hard reset (30/30/30) and even longer periods but it didn&#039;t work. I was trying to connect to router in failsafe mode but still without success. I can connect to the main page (192.168.1.1) of router, and i can ping through ethernet cable when the router is fully booted. Wireless is shown on my laptop/smartphone and i can connect into becouse i guessed the right password (lol <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> )<br />Telnet doesn&#039;t work too. </p><p>Then i&#039;ve soldered pins to rx/tx/gnd/vcc conncetors and try to connect router via USB/TTL(serial) connections. I&#039;ve been using&nbsp; 115200/8N1 settings and putty. I&#039;ve tried on HyperTerminal too but i don&#039;t get any response from serial port visible in putty/hypterminal. I can see some random symbols only if i&#039;m switching RX pin from usb/ttl on GND pin on the router.</p><p>After that i tested to see which port is opend on the router. The resoult gave me answer that only ports 22(SSH) and 53(DNS) are opened.</p><p>Is there any pins on the board to reset flash memory to factory preset settings or just to remove content from flash? (i shouldn&#039;t remove boodloader becouse than i wont be able to write on the chip)</p><p>What should i do to get it unbricked? Is there any way to hack into SSH? or to the router? (i need username and password to enter into SSH mode)</p><p>Thank you for any help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>giovannithex</strong> on 19 Apr 2015, 20:56)</p>

					<p>Your router is NOT bricked. It is operating normaly if you can connect to it&#039;s main page.<br />Go to this wiki link, read it in DETAIL and follow instructions how to do &quot;reset to factory details&quot; it is really easy.</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p><p>And here is youtube example - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axQvgqvlhcU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axQvgqvlhcU</a></p><p>Once you are connected via putty to your router just issue &quot;firstboot&quot; command that will reset all setting to factory defaults, and remove your previous password.</p><p>to just reset your password do this:<br />mount_root<br />passwd</p><p>and then enter new password and reboot the device.</p>									</div>
