					<p>Hello everyone, so I have Tp link TL-WA730RE wifi range extender. I know thaht hardware version 1 is supported by Openwrt, but I can&#039;t flash my v.2(as I found not supported). Is there any way of flashing it with Openwrt?<br />If I try to load Openwrt firmware for v.1 it says this: &quot;Error code: 18005 Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.&quot;. I Renamed the long name openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wa730rev1-squashfs-factory.bin to openwrt.bin so its not the name problem(tplink devices somehow don&#039;t recognize the file if its name is long). Please help me or just say its not possible so I don&#039;t try to do it any more.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
