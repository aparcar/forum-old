					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have a few questions about how to set up a bare minimum l2tp pseudowire, without ipsec.</p><p>First some background and what i want to achieve:<br />I have two DIR-825&#039;s, &quot;Bill&quot; and &quot;Bull&quot; (both running Attitude Adjustment trunk r31548). </p><p>This is the basic layout (there&#039;s lots more, but it shouldn&#039;t matter for this scenario):</p><p>Zyxel-----Bill********Bull--------STB</p><br /><p>&quot;Bill&quot;, is connected to a Zyxel triple-play DSL modem. The Zyxel is in bridged mode, and Bill is acting as a firewall/DHCP/DNS-server etc..<br />&quot;Bull&quot;, is in my living room connected via WIFI (as a WDS-client) to Bill. It&#039;s not runnnig a firewall, it&#039;s basically acting like a wireless switch.</p><p>In the living room i have an IPTV STB that i&#039;d like to use, but i don&#039;t want to run a physical cable to the Zyxel. <br />I&#039;ve tried to no avail to connect it to the Zyxel via IGMPproxy (using only Bill for testing), but haven&#039;t been able to get it working.</p><p>What i want to try now is an L2TP pseudowire between Bill and Bull, and &quot;fool&quot; the STB that it&#039;s connected straight to the Zyxel.<br />(I believe there is something fishy going on at the DHCP-stage that inits the STB, and i think an L2TP tunnel is the easiest way to get around it)</p><p>I&#039;ve had a look at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/pseudowire">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/pseudowire</a> but it&#039;s overly complicated for my needs, and the encryption is completely unnecessary.<br />From reading <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#protocol.l2tp.l2tp.pseudowire.tunnel">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network â€¦ ire.tunnel</a> it looks really simple. All i need to specify is the local and peer address (on both sides) for the tunnel to come up?<br />I assume i also need to specify which interfaces the tunnel should connect to?</p><p>On Bill there&#039;s no problem using a separate physical switch port (possibly tagged to an appropriate VLAN) to connect a second cable to the Zyxel (i&#039;m using the wan port for normal internet traffic).<br />On Bull i suppose the easiest way is to just use the wan (eth1) port and separate it from the normal bridge.</p><p>I basically want to check if my assumptions are right, and that i&#039;m not going to lock myself out with some stupid config mistake.<br />Will i have to specify an ip-address for the interface connecting to the Zyxel on Bill or the interface connecting to the STB on Bull?<br />From what i understand, IP&#039;s should only really be necessary for the interfaces that connect Bill and Bull?</p><p>How do i specify which interfaces the tunnel should use? Something like this?</p><p>Bill:<br />config interface l2tp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth0.x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; l2tp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option localaddr 192.168.2.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option peeraddr 192.168.2.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Bull:<br />config interface l2tp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;eth1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; l2tp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option localaddr 192.168.2.2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option peeraddr 192.168.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>The wlan on each end is specified implicitly throught the IP-address, right?</p><p>On Bill i probably also need to tag the port connected to the Zyxel with the same VLAN ID as the Zyxel is using for IPTV?</p><p>Is there anything else i need to set up? Firewall rules on Bill possibly?</p><p>Any input would be greatly appreciated, i feel a bit hesitant to start meddling with my current setup (which works quite well, except for the STB) before i get a grip on the facts.</p><p>Regards<br />/Andreas</p>									</div>

					<p>So i&#039;ve been trying this, but can&#039;t seem to get it to work.</p><p>Now i&#039;m starting to look into my build to see if there are any gotchas...<br />For some reason i decided to build the images with netifd.<br />Will netifd and l2tpv3 work together? <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/netifd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/netifd</a> doesn&#039;t mention l2tp as proto, but it may be out of date... </p><p>I&#039;ve configured the tunnels via /etc/config/network as above, but i seem to be missing something vital.</p><p>I&#039;ve seen there has been some recent activity around netifd in the timeline, would an upgrade to latest trunk be worth the effort?<br />Should i just rebuild my current images without netifd?</p><p>On a side note about l2tp:</p><p>My understanding about the mac/ip-addressing of the tunnel is a little hazy.<br />Is the mac address of the STB visible on the tunnel port on Bill? This would be ideal for my purposes.<br />How do i (and do i need to) set IP-adresses for the tunnel interface end points?</p><p>Has anyone else here tried to set up an l2tpv3 tunnel, without ipsec? I need all the help i can get <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>PS i&#039;ve been playing around a bit with l2tpv3tun manually, and it seems to kindof work, i get a new interface on each router. <br />No traffic yet though. And i would ideally like to use uci for the config.</p><br /><p>/Andreas</p>									</div>
