					<p>Greetings guys!</p><p>I&#039;m fairly new to Linux and Openwrt. I&#039;ve successfully compiled packages using &quot;make&quot;, using &quot;&gt;&gt;./build.log&quot; to save log files. But I find it difficlut to locate problems going through 20m log file.</p><p>I read documents saying there&#039;s a &quot;log&quot; folder under &lt;buildroot&gt;. I can&#039;t find it after successful compiling. </p><p>What I want is to generate seperate logs for every package, similar to the link:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; follewed:https://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/logs/ar71xx/nand/</p><p>Another question:<br />I ran into lots of warnings such as:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; libtool: install: warning: remember to run `libtool --finish /usr/lib&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; aclocal.m4:17: warning: this file was generated for autoconf 2.69.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; WARNING: skipping openssh-moduli -- package not selected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; src/mkcasfw.c:621:3: warning: too many arguments for format [-Wformat-extra-args]</p><p>Are these warnings OK? I don&#039;t need packages such as &quot;openssh-modul&quot; though.</p><p>Any help is appreciated. It&#039;s quite amazing to discover such a beautiful world of OpenWRT and Linux programming!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tuochenlyu</strong> on 22 Nov 2014, 16:00)</p>

					<p>make menuconfig has &quot;Advanced configuration options&quot; -&gt; &quot;Enable log files during build process&quot;<br />( CONFIG_BUILD_LOG=y )</p><p>then you will have log files per package making analyzing error/warning in logs easier</p><p>libtool/aclocal.m4 are are probably some autotools warnings - normally these can be ignored<br />fixing autotools can get very complicated because of compatibility / portability issues and versioning</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; WARNING: skipping openssh-moduli -- package not selected<br />if you did make package/openssh/compile it tries to make all subtargets there (see call ... in Makefile) however your .config has the subtarget openssh-moduli disabled ... (because you did not select it in menuconfig or enable the config symbol)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; src/mkcasfw.c:621:3: warning: too many arguments for format [-Wformat-extra-args]</p><p>simple error can be ignored - you print 4 variables but you have 5 or more format strings (that determine how variables are printed in C)</p>									</div>

					<p>@zloop</p><p>Thank you, all those questions clearly answered, now I can look through logs to understand what is actually happening. 3k lines of warnings during first compile with only devices module selected, but doesn&#039;t seem to interrupt the process.<br />You&#039;ve been really helpful <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
