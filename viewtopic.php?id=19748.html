					<p>I produced a new build of openWrt, r15160.&nbsp; I flashed it on my NSLU2, logged in, and ran &quot;opkg update&quot;.&nbsp; As has been the case for a week or more, I had to edit &quot;/etc/opkg.conf&quot; and replace &quot;snapshots&quot; with &quot;kamikaze/8.09&quot; (is this a permanent change?).&nbsp; </p><p>I then ran &quot;opkg install usbutils&quot; to get access to lsusb.&nbsp; When I run lsusb, I get &quot;lsusb: can&#039;t resolve symbol &#039;__register_frame_info&#039;&quot;.&nbsp; I get this with a new usb audio device, but also if I remove it, reboot, plug in a Logitec Quickcam which worked last week, and try lsusb again.&nbsp; How do I resolve this issue so that lsusb works?</p>									</div>
