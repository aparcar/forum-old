					<p>I do not believe that you will find one.&nbsp; I have been looking for the same, ideally with dual Ethernet.&nbsp; </p><p>The closest thing I have found is the HooToo TM-03, which has a USB and micro-SD card reader.&nbsp; I asked the question if both are capable of acting as a storage device, and have not received a direct answer.&nbsp; Reading through the posts it does appear that the device can do this.&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=285337#p285337">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 37#p285337</a></p><p>Most will support a USB Hub, but I was unable to get the hub to run my EDIMAX 7811, but I do not want the extra hardware anyhow.&nbsp; I want to run a second radio AND a USB data device.</p>									</div>

					<p>@RangerZ,</p><p>Thank you for the reply and recommendation.</p><p>I think I&#039;m going to go with the Kingston Mobilelite G2 (MLWG2) - <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55077.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=55077.</a></p><p>16MB flash and 64MB RAM, $30 on Amazon. The TM-03 is only $20 right now, but I like the aesthetics of the Kingston more. </p><p>BTW, the HooToo TM-03 looks to support data/storage on the USB port since it&#039;s capable of hosting a hard drive on it.</p>									</div>
