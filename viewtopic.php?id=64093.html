					<p>Hi all, newbie here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I have been trying/reading various things for the past 6 hours but have had no luck at all, so I have decided to register and just ask - I&#039;m sorry if there is an obvious answer somewhere. I have browsed the Wiki and forum quite extensively and cannot seem to find an answer for my particular situation.</p><p>Basically, I have fibre running into a Vodafone (Huawei) HG659 RGW but unfortunately the WiFi coverage in the house is not that great, so I dug up my old HG556a and flashed OpenWrt (Chaos Calmer) with the hopes of getting it working as a repeater. What I want to do is to have the HG556a connect wirelessly to the HG659 and then also transmit its own wireless signal so that a larger area of the house is covered. I am not too fussed about bridging/letting only the HG659 handle DHCP, etc. I wouldn&#039;t mind it if they had different SSIDs or if the devices on the two networks cannot communicate with each other (obviously this would be the best and would allow a seamless experience, but from what I&#039;ve read it seems a little complex?). What would be the best/easiest way to go about this?</p><p>Thank you very much in advance for any help!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, thank you so much for your response!</p><p>I am going to try that today but just have one other question - don&#039;t I need to also add my existing wireless network as a WDS client beforehand? Otherwise the router would not have access to the internet or am I mistaken in thinking that?</p>									</div>
