					<p>I&#039;m no pro but am no dummy, and I really don&#039;t see why something so simple isn&#039;t. Can anyone save me?!</p><p><strong>Enviro</strong>:<br />TP-Link MR3040 v2<br />OpenWRT 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)</p><p><strong>Config</strong>: (purposely super bare bones)<br /></p><ul><li><p>All DEFAULT settings (router at 192.168.1.1, LAN interface)</p></li><li><p>PC connected to LAN, gets IP as expected, no prob. (192.168.1.120)</p></li><li><p>In OpenWRT via web, Go to Network -&gt; DHCP &amp; DNS</p></li><li><p>Simply enter &quot;<strong>/somedomain.com/192.168.1.120</strong>&quot; in the DNS Forwarding field, Save &amp; Update</p></li><li><p>Open a cmd prompt: ping somedomain.com</p></li><li><p>Result: NOTHING. &quot;Ping request could not find host somedomain.com Please check the name and try again.&quot;</p></li><li><p>tracert somedomain.com. Result: &quot;Unable to resolve target system name somedomain.com&quot;</p></li></ul><p>WHY?????&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t get more simple than this.&nbsp; What in the world?&nbsp; I just want the ping to route than name back to my x.120 PC. Not rocket science.</p><p>So I double check everything:<br />-From the router diags, I can ping 192.168.1.120.&nbsp; I cannot ping somedomain.com<br />-From the CMD prompt on PC, I can ping 192.168.1.1 and x.120. But I cannot ping somedomain.com<br />-tracert can&#039;t do anything either. Doesn&#039;t even show the attempt to hit the router, just gives the error mentioned above.</p><p>I know that the entry in the router is doing SOMETHING because without it, I get the &quot;ping request could not find host...&quot; instantly if the router has no DNS forwarding, but when I do add the forwarding config, it thinks about this for a bit before coming back with that same error.</p><p>Help please... <strong>surely I am missing something simple?&nbsp; </strong></p><p>Works fine on my tomato router, no questions. Set a dnsmasq entry of &quot;/somedomain.com/192.168.1.120&quot;, poof, done, working.&nbsp; This is my first attempt doing the same on OpenWRT - maybe something easy but not obvious is also needed here??</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you anomeome.&nbsp; I was using the web interface of OpenWRT, &quot;DNS forwardings&quot;.&nbsp; Does that not add the correct entry in Dnsmasq Config?&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>list server                 &#039;/pool.ntp.org/208.67.222.222&#039;</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>&quot;DNS forwarding&quot; means that when the client asks for &quot;somedomain.com&quot;, the server answers with &quot;go ask 192.168.1.120&quot;; and unless you have a DNS at 192.168.1.120, I guess what really you need is that your DNS answers with &quot;somedomain.com is 192.168.1.120&quot;.</p><p>For this, you can just add a line at &quot;/etc/hosts&quot; (if you configured DNSMASQ to use &quot;/etc/hosts&quot;), or you could use a static lease for that machine and attach a name to it, or you could use the &quot;domain&quot; option at &quot;/etc/config/dhcp&quot;, or use the &quot;address&quot; directive in &quot;/etc/dnsmasq.conf&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>My scenario is simple:</p><p>I have a dev machine running a web server that I am testing using a domain name rather than IP.&nbsp; When I plug it into my Tomato router that has dnsmasq configured to point to this box (IP of dev machine running web server), I get Reply immediately from a ping on the domain name.</p><p>Plug this same machine into my OpenWRT router with dnsmasq configured to point to this machine, ping gets nothing.&nbsp; Nadda.</p><p>So yes, it is supposed to &quot;go ask 192.168.1.120&quot;, and said machine at x.120 is listening just like it was on my other router, but the ping never makes it when using OpenWRT dnsmasq.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>RESOLVED</strong>.</p><p>Ok, like I said in the OP, I&#039;m no DNS expert. It turns out (and I did not realize) that DNS Forwarding in OpenWRT is NOT the same as dnsmasq config.&nbsp; DNS forwarding is a DHCP function, but dosn&#039;t affect dnsmasq config.</p><p>Where I got lost...</p><p><strong>DNS Forwardings</strong> expects a format like this:<br /><span style="color: orange">/somedomain.com/192.168.1.120</span></p><p><strong>dnsmasq</strong> expects a format like this:<br />address=<span style="color: orange">/somedomain.com/192.168.1.120</span></p><p>I assumed that (in the web admin page of OpenWRT) the DNS Forwardings was actually creating a dnsmasq config &quot;address&quot; entry.&nbsp; Nope, nope, and nope.</p><p><strong>SOLUTION</strong>:<br />-Open /etc/dnsmasq.conf from SSH connection to the router (used Putty on Windows)<br />-add the line &quot;address=/somedomain.com/192.168.1.120&quot;&nbsp; (i used &quot;vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf&quot;)<br />-save and reboot.&nbsp; BAM!&nbsp; pinging the name routes and resolves to the target machine as expected</p><p>In Tomato, I can add the address config right into the web admin page for advanced DNS.&nbsp; In OpenWRT... you can&#039;t!&nbsp; Soooo annoying.&nbsp; Totally threw me off, and VERY annoying that I have to terminal in and edit files to tweak this.</p><p>Next up: find out where <strong>OpenWRT feature requests</strong> go. It is completely stupid that you can&#039;t do quick dnsmasq updates to this through the web interface.</p><p>Thank you @6eduperez and @anomeome, you gave me sufficient clues and tips to explore enough to figure this out.</p>									</div>
