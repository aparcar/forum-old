					<p>Hello!</p><p>I’m looking for a module that supports OpenWRT and has audio input. Both analog and PCM. The best would be one module for both, but it can be one module for OpenWRT and another for the audio. I’m quite sure I can do the software part, but I’m not good at the hardware part. </p><p>I have bought the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/oolite/oolitev1">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/oolite/oolitev1</a> and succeeded to do what I wanted with a cheap USB-soundcard (<a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/2015-Hot-7-1-Channel-USB-External-Sound-Card-Audio-Adapter/32263900633.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/2015-Hot … 00633.html</a>). But the soundcard is to slow for what I need. And my plan is to build this with “components”/modules anyways.&nbsp; </p><p>So my new idea is to use the I2S connector. But I don’t know what module/chip I should use for a fast audio decoding, and that works with the I2S. Anyone have an idea? </p><p>Have anyone used this module and the I2S? </p><p>Or does anyone have a suggestion about another module I can use instead for my project? </p><p>Thanks!<br />Magnus</p>									</div>

					<p>Give more details. I have a USB cheap sound card and I can read input samples with a rate of 48khz, do you need a greater sampling rate? or what do you mean with &quot;fast audio decoding&quot;? Input audio in a USB sound card it&#039;s not encoded.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KHAN85</strong> on 10 Apr 2015, 22:57)</p>

And now ppl complain about &quot;slow soundcards&quot; and hardware thats not fast enough</p><p>- Pulseaudio has a scheduler for &quot;real time&quot;<br />- there are Linux RT patches<br />- use some board with programmable DSPs</p>									</div>

					<p>a driver of cheap USB sound card is the easiest thing of the world, for input data, it receive URB_ISOCHRONOUS packets with raw pcm data, at 48khz sampling rate and 16 bits (there are no options to configure other sampling rates or formats at hardware level). </p><p>You can use tcpdump + usbmon for USB sniffing and code your own usb sound card drivers in a fews of lines of code. It uses about 100 KB/s of usb bandwidth, any pendrive uses a lot more usb bandwidth without speed problems in cheaps routers with usb running openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for both your answer! </p><p>I can see that my explanation isn’t that good with just “to slow”.</p><p>My I test was to do a program that read from /dev/dsp and just wrote to /dev/dsp “in the next line” of code without any delay. The sound was noticeable delayed (microphone to speakers), maybe 500ms. My thought was then that the D/A --- A/D conversion was slow in the soundcard. But maybe my conclusion was wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>There is only enough memory in a USB soundcard to hold the next millisecond of sound, since that is the rate at which packets of samples are serviced by USB.&nbsp; The latency is in the driver stack in the kernel and user space.&nbsp; There are some low-latency projects that take more direct control of the USB bus.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 11 Apr 2015, 17:12)</p>
