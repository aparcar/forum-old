					<p>I&#039;ve seen the ar71xx branch has support for the Zcom ZCN-1523 wireless access points. <br />Can anyone share some experiences? I would like to flash it with OpenWRT but I couldn&#039;t find any references of other people who might have tried it.</p><p>Thanks,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hgblob</strong> on 2 Nov 2010, 21:53)</p>

					<p>Just to answer my own question in case someone else is in this situation - I went along and flashed the factory image openwrt-ar71xx-generic-zcn-1523h-5-16-squashfs-factory.img from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-zcn-1523h-5-16-squashfs-factory.img">here</a> using the Zcom web interface and everything went ok:</p><p>* system booted fine <br />* wireless works fine<br />* both ethernet ports work</p>									</div>

					<p>No, not yet, I&#039;m still trying to figure this one out. By default in OpenWRT the external antenna is selected and thus you will have some problems with out it(lower signal and so on).

					<p>I tried the latest openwrt image (10-3-2016) for zcn-1523h-5-8 . It loads and works, but it would not connect through the external antenna. I tried every tx/rxantenna setting possible. I could not find anything about it switching antennas searching through the source code. i tried reverting the firmware using the instructions. CANT LINK TO TOPIC <br />The revert appeared to work.&nbsp; Last message was rebooting... <br />I cant seem to find it now. I it is not getting an address from the DHCP server, or responding at 192.168.1.1 like it should have if it worked.<br />I have 3 other zcn-1523h-2-4s using openwrt (9-2?-2016) in AP mode working perfectly with internal antennas.</p><p>Looks like i am going to have to byte the bullet (ubiquiti).</p>									</div>
