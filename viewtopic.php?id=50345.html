					<p>Hi first I would like to say that OpenWrt is some good product so thnx to the dev&#039;s and supporters, here&#039;s my Q:</p><p>In the setting below all machines connect to the AP using Wifi and are not getting an IP on Mac address from the Router.&nbsp; I can see they are connected to the AP but are not reachable because of the lack of an IP. When I make it static I can access them and they can access the WAN. Somehow the DHCP request isn&#039;t coming through.</p><p>Is there a solution to this problem I read something about a problem using Atheros and Broadcom and a wireless bridge and that arpnat might solve it. I also read that Gargoyle has this &quot;hack&quot; installed, yet I tested it (see above), but it doesn&#039;t solve it.</p><p>When I change the firmware from OpenWrt/Gargoyle to DD-WRT for the wireless bridge all machines get an IP using DHCP.</p><p>Thnx for any help in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Qinn</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>I have the following setup:</p><p>WAN---cable--- Router(DHCP on mac address)---cable--- RouterinWirelessbridgemode---wifi---AP---wifi</p><p>The Router (DHCP) is a OpenBsd machine</p><p>The router in wireless bridge mode is TP-Link WR841n v8 (atheros)using:<br />1. OpenWrt&nbsp; attitude adjustment 12.09<br />2. Gargoyle_1.6.1-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841nd-v3-squashfs-factory.bin</p><p>The AP is an ASUS RT-N16 (broadcom) using OpenWrt barrier bracker from 27-4-2014 after install I installed Luci as Gui</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Qinn</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 18:43)</p>
