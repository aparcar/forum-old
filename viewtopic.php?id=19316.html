					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I installed the siproxd package, but there are no plugins included.<br />The openwrt Makefile for siproxd just installs the main binary and ignores the plugins.</p><p>could someone patch the Makefile and rebuild the package?</p><p>I would like to do this myself but I only have really old computers and building the toolchain and packages would take a day or so...</p><p>ahandi</p><p>EDIT: cross-built the plugins myself, plugin_shortdial.so is&nbsp; 9400 bytes, and works fine</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ahandi</strong> on 13 Mar 2009, 20:55)</p>
