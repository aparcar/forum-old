					<p>well what ever its worth.. whenever i&#039;ve messed up installed packages of screwed the config real bad. I&#039;ve deleted everything in /overlay, reboot the router and it boots up as new openwrt with default settings.</p><p>This suggestion was given to me by someone more experienced several months back when i had just started wetting my feet with openwrt for the time..</p><p>PS. I&#039;ve had a scenario in the past, twice, where i flashed from oem to openwrt and it came back with all my settings!!!</p><p>I think it depends what was in your secondary flash or maybe in my case, it had ended up booting the secondary flash that retained my settings... It was something i never looked into it any further but it did happen.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alirz</strong> on 29 Jun 2015, 23:02)</p>

Factory (and McWrt) use the syscfg partition. OpenWrt does not store any settings in syscfg (except a backup, see below).</p><p>It&#039;s a bit tricky when talking about flashing back/forth from factory. When flashing a non-sysupgrade image (e.g. factory image) if keeping settings it will copy settings to /tmp/syscfg/sysupgrade.tgz. Since the syscfg partition is a single partition (unlike rootfs/kernel) and the Linksys firmware doesn&#039;t touch it, that&#039;ll be there when you flash back to OpenWrt. You would end up with your settings back after all.</p><p>Going between OpenWrt images there&#039;s no issue if you don&#039;t preserve settings. It&#039;ll bounce back between the two firmware partitions, and since the flashing process erases the old rootfs_data volume any settings will be gone. Unless there&#039;s some sort of warm-boot issue (e.g. factory firmware resets something in the hardware that the OpenWrt drivers don&#039;t) there should be no difference between flashing between OpenWrt builds and flashing back to factory first. (edit: and that hypothetical would only matter until you powered off the unit)</p><p>If you really wanted to be sure, you can erase the other flash partition before attempting to flash a new image (I never do this). The current rootfs volume is called &#039;ubi&#039;, so you can just grep for &#039;rootfs&#039;:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@wrt1900ac:/lib/upgrade# grep rootfs /proc/mtd
mtd7: 02500000 00020000 &quot;rootfs2&quot;
root@wrt1900ac:/lib/upgrade# </code></pre></div><p>That means you should erase &#039;kernel2&#039; in this case (erasing alt_nand):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd erase kernel2</code></pre></div><p>kernel2 overlaps and totally contains rootfs2.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>leitec</strong> on 29 Jun 2015, 23:19)</p>

I realize people are saying NAT is cpu bound on OpenWrt, but I didn&#039;t find it to be CPU bound as the TOP graph above shows. For those who know networking, Layer 3 (Network) is always going to be slower than Layer 2, and inherently so.&nbsp; Was the slowness due to NAT translations or the IP layer (maybe a combination of the two)? </p><p>Load was increased during the download whilst NAT was involved, but I don&#039;t believe the load was cpu bound, but <strong>IRQ bound</strong>. </p><p>The below is a sample of highest load processes during NAT download. Notice ksofirqd/0 is eating some processor. </p><p>&nbsp; PID&nbsp; PPID USER&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STAT&nbsp; &nbsp;VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SW&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp;0%&nbsp; 31% [ksoftirqd/0]<br />&nbsp; 414&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RW&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp;6% [kworker/0:2]</p><p>A little bit of research about ksofirqd shows the following....</p><p>&quot;In some situations IRQs come very very fast one after the other and the operating system cannot finish servicing one before another one arrives. This can happen when a high speed network card receives a very large number of packets in a short time frame.</p><p>Because the operating system cannot handle IRQs as they arrive (because they arrive too fast one after the other), the operating system queues them for later processing by a special internal process named ksoftirqd.</p><p>If ksoftirqd is taking more than a tiny percentage of CPU time, this indicates the machine is under heavy interrupt load.&quot;</p><br /><p><strong>So this bears the question.... Has anyone tried to tweak affinity &gt;&gt; smp_affinity&nbsp; so as to reduce IRQ load?</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 30 Jun 2015, 02:46)</p>
