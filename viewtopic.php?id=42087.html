					<p>I received my third tp link router, and I some how messed up on the flashing process, which idk how since you basically use the firmware upgrade page to install the openwrt image. Anyways when I powered it up and waited couple of minutes to make sure it was fully booted, I tried to telnet but it wouldn&#039;t let me. I first thought I didnt set static ip, and I checked my settings but it was already set with static ip. I pinged it, and did not get a response. I tried to get into failsafe mode, nothing. I tried different ethernet cords, different computers, different os, and nothing. The led is solid atm and hasn&#039;t blinked since it been on.<br />What can I do before resorting to unbrick it?</p>									</div>
