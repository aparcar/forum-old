					<p>I at the moment am myself frustrated with openwrt on my router. For instance when I had dd-wrt on it I used the documentation available on there site to make the firewall drop all packets that were not destined to those couple ports that I deemed important. After wards I went online and did a grc port scan test. It passed with ease. It just seemed so simple and I was so proud of my self for flashing my router with dd-wrt. I could really have made my self a cocktail but I did not of course but now on openwrt I do not feel like cheering so I am not drinking any cocktails either.</p><p>Now that I have openwrt on my router and I can not pass the grc test no matter what I do. A while ago I posted a thread on here describing my problem exactly and no one wanted to help.</p>									</div>

Unlike other firmware projects that come pre-configured and with every bell and whistle included, it pretty much only delivers a baseline function and then it&#039;s up to the individual user&#039;s needs what to do with it. For people who know what they are doing, or who want to find out and educate themselves this is an enormeous advantage. For those who can&#039;t, or outright refuse to, get to know the system this would be its greatest shortcoming.</p><p>Yes, you are absolutely right. I would not recommend OpenWrt to anyone who&#039;s not able and/or willing to get into the details of what they are doing with it.</p><p>Also, yes, OpenWrt has some shortcomings in its, for lack of a better word, &quot;support structure&quot;. The wiki is very often very helpful, but not always up-to-date. This is partly remedied by this forum which is basically just one big board for every issue, it could probably be structured a little bit better.</p><p>However, what OpenWrt is decidedly <em>not</em> lacking is a very active and very helpful community.</p>									</div>

					<p>Openwrt is great option, but it is not the only one and not for everyone. I still don&#039;t have answers to all the questions I have asked in here, but it does mean nothing. I&#039;m following the community 2 years and I can tell people here are really great, no haters, no flame warriors, just kind and helpful people, even when I happen to ask very stupid questions <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> People reply only if they know, they have time and they want. I came from dd-wrt too, firmware has nicer web gui, some people around ddwrt are not even nearly that nice, but I like some there too. Openwrt is just different, more like linux machine, ddwrt is click and go for newbies, but if you want something uncommon, you get stuck. If you have been unlucky, don&#039;t blame the community. If you want 24/7 support, buy a cisco router with support pack.</p>									</div>

I was asking for users experience with reverting WR1043ND v2. Yes, i&#039;d read the Wiki, I&#039;d also read the forums where a number of people had commented on how they had managed to brick their WR1043ND v2&#039;s by trying to revert. Also, if you read the Wiki it states that it isn&#039;t possible to unbrick the router using JTAG - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#jtag">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#jtag</a> - so at this stage i haven&#039;t messed up. The router is still running with OpenWrt installed, however, I would like to remove and avoid bricking the device.</p>									</div>

					<p>just looked at the wiki for this device and have to say reverting to stock is covered OK there. They even include a link to the trimmed firmware that is required, which is the hard part in reverting this device. All you have to do is flash the trimmed firmware via Luci or command line. </p><p>That wiki could stand to be cleaned up a little though.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m sure other WR1043ND v2 users will appreciate it. You are likely to reach a larger audience if you update the wiki page rather than link out to your document. Or better yet, update the wiki with a text description and THEN link out to your document for screenshots and more detail.</p>									</div>
