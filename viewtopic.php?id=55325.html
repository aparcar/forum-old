					<p>Hello,</p><p>I would like to have two internet connections, one directly as provided for gerneral traffic and one via a VPN provider for streaming. The idea is, to&nbsp; use the vpn access for my media player only.</p><p>So my plan is, to use a Openwrt router and connect both, wan and lan interface, to my existing lan and defining the router&#039;s lan interface as gateway for my media player. In Openwrt, I would use openvpn.<br />Can this work? Is there anywhere a how-to I could follow?<br />Any better solution for this?</p><p>I am happy for any hint!<br />Thank,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zappel.</p>									</div>

					<p>This is not quite the way to do it.</p><p>Presuming your media player is a physical machine you are on the right track... but you do not need to connect the WAN interface of OpenWRT to anything - just make it a LAN member and set it as default gateway on your mediaplayer.</p><p>If your media player is just a software application it gets more difficult.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>thanks for the answer!!<br />I still have a TP_Link wr703n with Openwrt lying around here.<br />But it has only one LAN port. And I don&#039;t want to use Wlan.<br />But if I understood you right, this would be possible?!?<br />So that means the traffic goes in and out through the same lan port?</p><p>And yes, my media player is a hardware device.</p><p>Regards, Zappel.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have not tried exactly the same thing myself... but I think that is the way to do it.<br />Just<br /> - connect its LAN port to your normal LAN (it will get one LAN IP)<br /> - install VPN client on it<br /> - configure VPN as default gateway on your wr703n<br /> - configure your wr703 as default gateway on your media player</p>									</div>
