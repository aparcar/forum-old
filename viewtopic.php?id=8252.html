					<p>Hi @ all,</p><p>i&#039;m pretty new to this openwrt thing. Everything is working so far. But i don&#039;t know how to setup a Internet Access Restriction. I want to allow a specific computer Internet Access only for a defined time. How can i realize this. Is it done by cron + iptables ? I hope somebody can help me with this. Thanks a lot</p><p>der_Kief</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>der_Kief</strong> on 19 Nov 2006, 22:50)</p>

					<p>Hi -</p><p>I personally do it semi, my children are limited by time to access the internet.<br />Basically I have 2 different dhcp setups - I give my children different IP&#039;s according to time.<br />At night they get an ip which is blocked in iptables so they only can get and send email.<br />The switch is done by cron, I would prefer to use the time module of IPtables, but that require that the kernel is compiled with that option, which RC6 is not, some say it will come but until then - there is the half good way.</p><p>hope you can use the information <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>thanks for the useful information. I think i give it a try ( because children don&#039;t hear what adults say <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; )<br />Hopefully the time module of IPtables is integrated soon.

					<p>I was looking for a way to prevent my kids from getting on the internet all day.&nbsp; I&#039;m aware that current routers offer some sort of scheduling access, but it&#039;s hard to set up, and not flexible enough to offer granular time block for each day for each computer.&nbsp; The UI you saw is a mockup, which demonstrates the capability.&nbsp; It was also used as a proof of concept.&nbsp; I have a working version now running on my own custom router at home.</p><p>I&#039;m in the process of integrating it into the home-based routers.&nbsp; My first router is the Trendnet tew-652brp.&nbsp; Unfortunately, openwrt does not support it yet, so I&#039;m trying to get around that by making it an add-on to the stock firmware.&nbsp; My goal is to offer it as an add-on feature to any router, whether it&#039;s openwrt or stock firmware, probably whichever is easier for me to do.</p><p>What I came up with was for my requirement.&nbsp; If anyone has any other feature they think should be included, please feel free to chime in.&nbsp; This could be an entirely new project.</p>									</div>
