					<p>I have no suitable access to internet at home. I have&nbsp; a router with an external hd that is set as a wireless client and downloads what I need when I bring it to places with internet connection. I am able to run svn update from within the router but there are a few perl things that are missing. Should i just install all the perlbase packages? Space is not a problem and I have swap space if needed.</p><p>thanks.</p>									</div>
