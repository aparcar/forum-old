					<p>Hi all<br />First post following a sucessful install on my MR18 (using method 3).</p><p>I have OpenWRT running well, and have configured the MR18 as a dumb AP, as I already have a Cisco E3000 running DDWRT as my main router.</p><p>The problem I have (this could be stupidity or not) is that I can&#039;t get the Merkaki to broadcast on the 5GHZ radio.</p><p>All settings are pretty much as per the wiki page.<br />I started giving it the same name as the 2.4 radio, but couldn&#039;t see it, so I change the name but could still only see the 2.4 radio.</p><p>I was careful when usig the UART to ensure I didn&#039;t disturb any antenna cables, but it&#039;s possible that I snagged one, however I wanted to check if I&#039;d missed an obvious soft setting before dismantling the case again..</p><p>Please let me know what I can provide settings wise - I&#039;ll need to stick any images up somewhere first - or if you can guide me through the CLI I&#039;m happy to provide output from there...</p>									</div>
