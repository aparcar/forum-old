					<p>Hi,<br />I have read this forum as much as I could and so far I did not manage to fix my MR3020 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>My story: the box is Revision 1.1<br />I flashed via router&#039;s web interface the image <a href="http://www.zamponi.de/post/36155716109/webcam-server-with-dropbox-integration">found here</a>. I need to add a web cam and save images or video (preferred) to my dropbox account via 3G network.<br />After the firmware upgrade, the router rebooted but now I am unable to connect to MR3020 anymore <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />If I manually assign IP address windows will connect to router, but I get 0 received packages (send is working).</p><p>I read in this forum and build an usb to serial interface and managed to connect to MR3020 via internal serial port, but when I insert the power, after some messages the router hangs at this message: &quot;turn off boot console early0&quot; and freeze.</p><p>I can get to &quot;hornet&gt;&quot; prompt if I pres TPL but I have no ideea how to send a new OpenWRT image in the box to change the firmware. I am a windows user but can learn linux if needed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I found some info about TFTP server but I think this is for linux (I can install ubuntu on some old pc I have but I don&#039;t now exactly how to work with tftp)</p><p>Thank you for any help.<br />Daniel M.</p><p>PS I forgot to write that I use putty via serial since telnet will not connect via LAN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dani146</strong> on 26 Mar 2013, 19:16)</p>
