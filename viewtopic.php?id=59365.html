					<p>I was in Europe recently and while talking to friend, he said he had heard of some discussions about consumer grade equipment that would make it impossible for the user to configure it themselves. All control of home/consumer network equipment would be under the total control of the ISP. According to him there would be no user interface, all control/configuration of home/consumer network equipment would be done remotely by the &quot;ISP&quot;. <br />Plus there was also rumored to be some discussion about making it a criminal offense to even look inside the equipment. </p><p>I have not been able to confirm either of these stories.

					<p>Interestingly enough if you read this and the FCC stuff, these rules will apply to any device that has radio equipment in it.<br />In the FCC stuff they specifically mention <strong>Routers, cell phones, PCs, Tablets, Wireless remote controls, appliances ....</strong> basically anything with WiFi capability. Plus the definition of software is very broad. According to one person I talked to about this it could easily be interpreted to include all software installed on the device including applications. Essentially the manufacturer/vendor will be able to control what software you can use and how you can use it.</p><p>In addition the ability to configure/reconfigure the device may be restricted, and again the definition of what maybe configured is very broad and could be interpreted to include any aspect of the devices operation - privacy, tracking ....</p><p>As I said in an earlier post, the rumor mill has it, there would be no user interface allowed for configuring such devices everything would be done by the <em>vendor/service provider</em>.</p><p>If these changes go through, and I don&#039;t see much opposition, it puts the whole idea FOSS out of business.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zzz2002</strong> on 3 Sep 2015, 19:20)</p>

					<p>That may be the intention of the FCC and EU directives. <br />Unfortunately, because of the loose wording which leaves plenty of room for interpretation, the software industry could use it to lock the doors. This is not new they have been trying to do this for years, encrypted UEFI ring any bells.</p><p>If you own a late model cell phone you may know that any attempt to modify the firmware breaks the hardware and voids the warranty. In some cases it disables features or downgrades security. <br />Now they may feel that they have official sanction to just kill your device if try to <em>tamper</em>.</p><p>Moreover, although I think the rumors I have heard on this are ridiculous but if they are true then tampering with such electronic devices may become a criminal offense.</p><p>I don&#039;t know when, where or how the NSA poped up in the conversation.</p>									</div>

					<p>.gov lost all my trust this year. </p><p>There is way too much .gov funded surveillance crap out there.&nbsp; Better be safe then sorry...<br />Sure it is ridiculous, I know but if you are not an American then you are just wildlife at the wrong end of a shotgun...&nbsp; I have nothing against American citizens just don&#039;t trust the current govnerment and it tentacles. EU gov isn&#039;t any better either for that matter.&nbsp; And also not saying that everyone who sits behind a .gov desk is evil. Though the good guys will have to do a lot of work until the trust is restored a little. </p><p>That second fcc document (the one that refers to dd-wrt) feels very much like a lobby action to me.<br />The legal lingo well. I don&#039;t think that is the best way to talk about technical issues.&nbsp; Regulating technical issuIs with legal lingo is like opening a banana with a hammer.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope you are right, you probably are, and if you can trust this that&#039;s great.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>To me, when Legal speak and lobby are in one document then that does not feel right at all. <br />English is not my native language, and the legal speak is hard to consume. </p><p>As always stuff like this should be read 2 times, 1 time to figure out what it intends to do and then 1 time to find the loopholes....&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try to fully read the European document in the first way to figure out what it intends to accomplish and what the reason is of doing all this.</p><p>I&#039;ll keep my thoughts for myself a bit longer this time... Maybe I spoke too soon....</p>									</div>
