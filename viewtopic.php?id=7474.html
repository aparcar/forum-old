					<p>Hello.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if anyone else has gotten kamikaze to work on a WRT54GL v1.1.&nbsp; I&#039;ve poured over the wiki and the forum, and i haven&#039;t found anything specifically related.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had no trouble compiling the kernel - i&#039;m quite comfortable in linux.&nbsp; Whenever I perform the upgrade either via mtd write w/ the .trx, or upgrade via tftp w/ the .bin, the router would never get past the flashing power light and I have to short the pins on the flash to recover.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried recompiling a few times, and even went searching out there to see if someone had a pre-compiled bin.&nbsp; No luck so far.&nbsp; Has anyone been able to get this to work, and can you offer any tips?</p><p>Kamikaze development is listed as ? on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … ys/WRT54GL</a> for V1.1.&nbsp; Since it seems to be basically the same as a V1, I didn&#039;t see any reason why it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>What I&#039;m trying to do is get my WRT54GL to associate in client mode to a WPA/PEAP network, and then try to do either client bridged or client routed mode (which ever I can get to work).&nbsp; We are running a Cisco LWAPP network, and many of the &quot;bridges&quot; out there either don&#039;t work or don&#039;t support WPA/PEAP, so this may be the only solution. </p><p>I am going to attempt this with RC5, but it seems like the people having luck with doing things of these sorts have all been running a 2.6 kernel.&nbsp; If anyone has any help regarding either of these, I would really appreciate your help.&nbsp; So far reading over these forums has been really enlightening, and i&#039;ve been really impressed by everything that has been acomplished so far.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Matt</p>									</div>

Important problem with v1.1 is that Linksys switched to Samsung flash chips. As for now they are not supported with 2.6.17 (and 2.6.18 either). I&#039;ve patched the chip id procedure to make the chip detected, but then programming flash with mtd tool doesn&#039;t work. (Programming single bytes/files seems to work fine, since passwd and other changes to filesystem works. Hmmm... erase problem?).</p><p>As far as I can tell, wireless port does not work with 2.6 too, but I will do some more research before filling the ticket.</p><p>Regards,<br />BO</p>									</div>
