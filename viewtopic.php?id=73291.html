					<p>Hello,<br />I often have to use a network where I have to sign into a proxy server to have internet connection.<br />Is there a way to make openwrt do this for me?<br />I want to connect a router running openwrt via lan to the existing network so that it logs in to the proxy server and provides me WLAN where I don&#039;t have to sign in.<br />Would be really great if someone could help me.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can automate the process using curl request, sometimes even wget is sufficient. Good start is firefox, f12 - network, log into your proxy and see what is happening. You can right click interesting POST (or GET) request - copy - copy curl. Usually you will need more than one request, sometimes even extract session id&nbsp; before logging in, etc. Once you can automate the process, you can then write bash (or php/perl) scrip, which you can execute when router boots and/or from cron.</p>									</div>
