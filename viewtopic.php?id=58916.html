					<p>I have installed OpenWrt Barrier Breaker on my TP-LINK MR3020. The wifi has been enabled. My computer (mac OSX) is connected to the Wifi. </p><p>The moment I physically connect my ISP&#039;s ethernet line to my TP-LINK, the IP address, the subnet and router/gateway address all change to the one decided by my ISP. Then I am asked to login to my ISP in a popbox. </p><p>When I stick the ISP ethernet wire in my TP-LINK, two things happen:<br />1. Change of my local IP, subnet, gateway/ router page addresses (see left side of screenshot <a href="http://i.imgur.com/upvzmpE.png)">http://i.imgur.com/upvzmpE.png)</a><br />1. I can no longer access my router page running OpenWrt at 192.168.1.1</p><p>Which means:</p><p>1. Without connecting the wire *and* logging in I dont have access to internet.<br />2. With connecting the wire, I cannot access the router page (192.168.1.1 gets &#039;URL escaped&#039; and am redirected to the ISP login page)<br />3. With connecting the wire + logging in, I have internet but cannot access router page.</p><p>I feel that my ISP &#039;giving login and then overriding my router page&#039; is not uncommon and that its been solved before, so what are keywords to put in google to find solutions? </p><p>Importantly: How do I stop my ISP from doing this and still get access to Internet?</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I noticed that when my ISP asks me to login, the title of the window says &quot;Mikrotik Hotspot&quot;, googling I know that it means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikroTik.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikroTik.</a></p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sindhus</strong> on 8 Aug 2015, 17:37)</p>

					<p>Sounds like you have the ethernet bridged to the wireless, which makes sense as this would be the default config for the MR3020, ethernet+wireless bridged as lan and USB modem as wan.</p><p>You need to remove the ethernet from br-lan and the lan firewall zone, and reconfigure it as a dhcp client wan interface in the wan firewall zone.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi! Thanks so much for the reply. I am very new to Openwrt. Can you tell me what steps to follow in the UI? I dont really understand the instructions you gave. </p><p>P.s: hardware wise: I have access to a ethernet cable (via a USB adapter) as well.</p>									</div>

Login to the router via wifi, leave the ethernet disconnected.<br />2. Go to the network - interfaces page.<br />3. There should be an interface called br-lan. Click to edit it.<br />4. Go to &quot;physical settings&quot;. There should be a list of interfaces. The ethernet, probably called &quot;eth0&quot; and wireless interfaces should be ticked.<br />5. Untick &quot;eth0&quot;, or whatever your ethernet is called. This will remove it from the bridge.<br />6. Save and apply settings. You may get disconnected, but should be able to reconnect.<br />7. Login and go back to the interfaces page.<br />8. Click on &quot;add new interface&quot;<br />9. Name it &quot;eth-wan&quot;, select protocol &quot;dhcp client&quot; and tick the &quot;eth0&quot; (or whatever) interface.<br />10. Save and apply.<br />11. Go back to the interfaces page and edit the new &quot;eth-wan&quot; interface.<br />12. Go to&nbsp; &quot;firewall settings&quot;, and click the button to put it into the &quot;wan&quot; firewall zone.<br />13. Save and apply.<br />14. Plug the ethernet into your ISP ethernet connection.</p><p>15. Maybe it works...? I guess you will still have to login to your ISP&#039;s hotspot at 172.18.12.1 (this is a weird setup for an ethernet connection, BTW.), but your router should now get it&#039;s external IP from the ISP and be giving out private IP addresses on the wifi.</p>									</div>

You need to do a reset to defaults (poke something into the reset hole and power on) and try again following my guide above.</p>									</div>
