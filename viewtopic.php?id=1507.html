					<p>I am testing the 2005-04-23 experimental build (binaries from the OpenWrt site, not self-compiled) and I have just found that the ntpclient init script still has the same bug as in the older experimental versions.</p><p>When the WRT is not connected to internet, ntpclient cannot resolve the ntp server&#039;s name, and locks the boot process until it times out (or until I connect the WAN cable). Simply adding an &quot;&amp;&quot; in the /etc/init.d/S41ntpclient script allows for the boot process to complete even if the WAN interface is disconnected, still ntpclient starts and when WAN is connected the clock is set correctly.</p><p>I don&#039;t know how to (and if I can) submit a patch to the CVS repository.</p>									</div>

					<p>Try if you like. If you don&#039;t put the &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of the line, and your dns is unreachable for some reason, your boot will stall for some minutes before the dns request times out and then the boot goes on. I have tried it myself. The boot process actually goes on, but after a very long and annoying delay.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kurgan</strong> on 22 May 2005, 20:17)</p>

So I used background (&amp;) to put ntpclient in background. Also, you can rename S50clientntp to S98ntpclient. The task for updating time is not very important and shoud be call in the last tasks in boot process.</p>									</div>
