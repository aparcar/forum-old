					<p>RC6 has been released; while this is mostly a bugfix release, it does represent the end of the whiterussian era. Some changes worth noting -</p><p><strong>mini_fo</strong><br />The symlinks from jffs2 to squashfs are gone, now squashfs is mounted on /rom and jffs2 is mounted on /jffs. The / is a virtual directory containing the combined contents.</p><p><strong>timing fixes</strong><br />The bogomips calibration on some routers was wrong, leading to long delays and poor performance; this should be fixed in rc6.</p><p><strong>New diag module</strong><br />This is what controlls the leds and the buttons; now leds are /proc/diag/led and buttons trigger hotplug scripts in /etc/hotplug.d/button. (Now you can also press any button at startup to enter failsafe mode)</p><br /><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc6/">Downloads</a></p><p><strong>NOTE: pppoe users - be sure to use the correct image</strong></p>									</div>

					<p>The plans to make whiterussian into 1.0 ended a long time ago with the realization that the whiterussian branch was already too far behind development. So, pending any major issues, we may tag this as 0.9 and continue with the occasional security patch, but the whiterussian branch is effectively over.</p><p>All further development will focus on the kamikaze branch, now that buildroot-ng has been reintegrated. We will begin snapshot builds of kamikaze shortly in an effort to establish a regular release cycle and automated testing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mbm!</p><p>Thanks for the GREAT work on OpenWRT! It really is appreciated. (I can&#039;t imagine myself using Linksys original firmware anymore).</p><p>Anyway -- I hope you guys don&#039;t mind if I give you a suggestion. I see you opened two development branches, and one of them got stale. May I suggest a different version control system? With any of the newer/decentralized ones (Mercurial, Monotone, Git etc) you can propagate changes between branches more frequently and easily. And it may even be possible to migrate the history from Subversion, although I never did that.</p><p>-- jp</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think you understand the development model.</p><p>The progression goes something like this:</p><p>whiterussian -&gt; kamikaze -&gt; buildroot-ng -&gt; kamikaze</p><p>Whiterussian represents the original stable branch; around RC4 development shifted from keeping whiterussian up to date to building kamikaze into a release, and the whiterussian releases suffered. RC5 was released, but the original goals for whiterussian hadn&#039;t been met, so more releases of whiterussian were planned but got preempted by the rewrite kamikaze underwent with the &quot;buildroot-ng&quot; branch. Buildroot-ng revolutionized the build system used to compile kamikaze.</p><p>By now, the kamikaze and buildroot-ng branches were so far ahead of whiterussian that nobody really wanted another whiterussian release (broken build system with many obsolete packages), and there was talk of backporting kamikaze/buildroot-ng into whiterussian. Ultimately it was determined that this would take more effort than writing buildoor-ng in the first place. In other words, cut the losses, release one last whiterussian and switch over to kamikaze/buildroot-ng. We didn&#039;t want to wait so long that kamikaze would be basically cut and pasted into another group&#039;s firmware and released by someone else (long story).</p><p>RC6 is mostly about cleaning out all the old tickets and fixing some known bugs with RC5. Things like the new diag system were built out of necessity -- the old code was just too hacked and tangled to maintain. While testing the compatibility of the new diag driver on some obscure models I noticed the errors with the bogomips calculations, which basically caused the router to run over 3x slower than normal, which then prompted that patch -- it was never planned. mini_fo&nbsp; had been planned for rc5 but got pulled out at the last minute when various issues were discovered with the file handling.</p><p>Anyways .. getting back to earlier questions .. </p><p>Automated builds of the kamikaze branch will begin shortly, binaries for pretty much all platforms with all packages. This is mostly to help us track down issues with the build system, but these snapshots will be placed online for those that wish to experiment.</p><p>I want to make it clear that I do not intend to answer any more &quot;I bricked my router issues&quot;, a JTAG is only 4 resistors (easily under $5) and serial isn&#039;t much more, and can easily be made out of a cellphone cable. If you don&#039;t know how to recover from a bad firmware you should stay away from the kamikaze snapshots. I don&#039;t expect them to cause issues, but they are built by a script and untested on actual hardware.</p>									</div>

					<p>I didn&#039;t publish the jffs2 images because of the number of jffs2 vs squashfs questions.</p><p>People never read the wiki and are very confused at the differences between squashfs and jffs2, and often leave with the idea that they need to use the jffs2 images to have a writable filesystem, and then complain about things like failsafe (see common mistakes). I finally got so sick of it that I didn&#039;t even bother with the jffs2 images for RC6.</p><p>Incidentally, you can remove the squashfs partition from the router without reflashing, but that&#039;s a topic for another thread (this thread is just for rc6 feedback).</p>									</div>
