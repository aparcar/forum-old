					<p>Playdude, i stopped fiddling with the goflex as i had trouble building openwrt for it so i put it back to the original pogoplug firmware. I&#039;ve since got a few dockstars that i have been more succesful with. Once openwrt&nbsp; has got to the point where I want it, i&#039;ll go back to the goflex net. The specific problem i had was getting the openwrt u-boot to work. This could have been due to my build or the goflex. For the dockstar, i did a fresh build of openwrt on another machine and this worked on the dockstar, so at some stage i will try this on the goflex. I&#039;ll also have to get a laptop sata drive to test with as i don&#039;t have one at the moment. I dare say the sata on the kirkwood is much the same as the earlier orion class of cpu, so the sata driver has some history and most likely works. There&#039;s a option for it in the menuconfig.</p><p>The power supply section of the goflex seems to run cooler than the dockstar. Has there been any reprts of the dockstars being unreliable?<br />The goflex has some led bars that crudely indicate the disk space of the mounted drive. I&#039;ll have to see if i can decipher what port pins these use.</p><p>Watch this space.....</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the info Kartman.</p><p>Some guy reported that he was able to boot debian on his goflex net from usb, though booting from an attached sata drive wasn&#039;t possible yet. So I think it&#039;s possible to boot openwrt from usb, then load sata drivers and mount an attached sata drive. This is what I&#039;m trying to do if it&#039;s not possible to boot directly from a sata drive. Time to get a goflex net and test the theory...</p>									</div>

I thought my local Officeworks didn&#039;t have it until I found it tucked away in a corner. I&#039;ve had a play with it and found that I can plug a bare sata laptop hard drive on either of the 2 sata ports on top. There&#039;s no need for a goflex external hard drive. I also made a sata extension by breaking the plastic off a sata power cable and a data one.</p><p>After a brief dd test I fo that the average write speed to a connected sata drive was around 33 MB/s. So good news, I&#039;ve found a cheap NAS that breaks the 30 MB/s barrier <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>It was nice of seagate to use the standard sata layout. I was pondering last night how to extend the sata so that i could try a 3.5&quot; drive as i have no laptop drives. I&#039;ll have take a look at breaking the plastic as you mention to achieve this. My initial thought was to remove two sata connectors off a dud pc motherboard and solder them back to back for a sex changer.</p>									</div>

					<p>Haven&#039;t had much luck tonight - I&#039;ve bricked one of my Dockstars by accidently leaving out a 0 when writing to the nand and zapping the uboot.

Your other option is to scour through some local thrift stores in your area. Since DockStar is a discontinued product, I would certainly look for other device, i.e. Seagate GoFlex, etc., unless I can get it very inexpensive.</p>									</div>
