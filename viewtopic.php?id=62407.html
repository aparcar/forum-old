					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I just installed OpenWRT on my EA4500.&nbsp; It booted up and worked just fine, but I made an error when configuring and now the network doesn&#039;t work, so I need to use the failsafe method to reset it.</p><p>The problem is that I can&#039;t seem to enter failsafe mode.&nbsp; I&#039;ve followed the directions at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe,">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe,</a> but I still can&#039;t get it to enter failsafe mode.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even fired up tcpdump on my machine to listen for the UDP broadcast packet, but none comes.&nbsp; </p><p>Is there a known problem with failsafe on the EA4500, or any quirks about it anyone knows?</p>									</div>

					<p>Do the trunk OpenWRT builds overwrite both sets of firmware in the EA4500? I think not...but I&#039;m not certain.</p><p>One of the features of this model is that it has dual firmware, with the idea that if one gets corrupted it can just boot from the second copy. This is usually triggered by three failed boots and can be manually triggered by killing the power about 5-10 secs after power on, 3 times in a row.</p><p>I did a trunk build today, flashed it from the Linksys firmware and flashing seemed to work. But it didn&#039;t boot into OpenWRT. Just lots of the LED flashing until it came back up into the Linksys firmware. Presumably after failing to boot into OpenWRT 3 times in a row.</p><p>So I downloaded the trunk snapshot for the EA4500 instead (is from 4th Jan iirc, so older) and flashed with that from the Linksys firmware, works fine.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if thats any help. Maybe you need to look at debricking, attaching a serial cable etc as described on the wiki.</p>									</div>

					<p>That did it, I forced a failed boot three times and it flipped back to the stock firmware.&nbsp; Thanks!</p><p>I just downloaded the January 27 trunk snapshot and noticed that I get the same behavior as you (upgrade from stock appears to go fine, but then the router reboots into stock).&nbsp; Seems like something went bad between January 4th and now.&nbsp; I&#039;ll go dig up my Jan 4 copy now.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a 3500 which has the same basic board layout IIRC just more memory, faster SOC etc; and have been having constant issues trying to flash the new &quot;supported&quot; squashfs truck images with similar problems. To answer your question, no, it only flashes one partition as it seems you already found out. If you have a serial port connected you can easily switch between each image partition but it seems you have already found a solution . I&#039;m going to fill out a bug ticket. I was suspecting their was still something awry with the mounting the standard openwrt squashfs onto kirkwoods ubifs. They have a dynamic partition addressing scheme which I still dont understand, thus I have hesitated to fill out a ticket to the devs as I thought the errors were simply me having a&nbsp; misconfiguration. This gives me a little more confidence that that is not the case</p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like the 1900AC people had a similar bug with the new images not booting.&nbsp; I suspect it will fix ours as well.&nbsp; Looks like a fix was committed earlier today:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/21712">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/21712</a></p><p>Still doesn&#039;t fix the lack of failsafe, but maybe there&#039;s other commits post January 4 that do?</p>									</div>
