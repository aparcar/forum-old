					<p>Hi OpenWRT experts,</p><p>I have been reading about Wifi-Direct and it sounds exciting. It seems that no hardware change is required. Wifi-Direct runs a software AP on normal Wifi. </p><p>May I know if OpenWRT can support Wifi-Direct currently?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>WiFi Direct allows peers (like two android devices) to talk to each other without an access point. But your router is an access point, so you don&#039;t need Wifi Direct. <br />Why do you want WiFi direct? Can you not simply connect the phone to the access point in the normal manner? Once that connection is made, you should be able to SSH to the phone as you want. The normal Wifi access-point/client relationship places no restrictions on the direction of IP connections.</p>									</div>

There seems to be no way to tell it NOT to do this.</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK wifi direct isn&#039;t supported now, and some work has to be done upstream (wpa-supplicant, mac80211, ath9k) before you can think about an implementation in openwrt. </p><p>@Megadve: why don&#039;t you just use the hotspot-feature (wlan tethering) on your phone and connect your router or client to this AP as station? This way you will have a WLAN connection and your internetconnection through cellular will still be alive. </p><p>The only drawback might be the powerconsumtion, but I&#039;m not sure if wifi-direct would be much better.</p>									</div>
