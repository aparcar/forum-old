					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Let me start off by saying that I know that this topic has been covered before, and I apologize;&nbsp; I have used the search function here on the site as well as google.&nbsp; I still can&#039;t get one to one nat to work.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p><p>I have AT&amp;T Uverse with a /28 of public address space, that I&#039;d like use for 1 to 1 NAT for 3 hosts.&nbsp; The remaining hosts, can simply use many to 1 translations.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried configuring SNAT via the LuCI interface, but I lose Internet connectivity to the host machine that is supposed to be doing 1 to 1 NAT.&nbsp; I tried manually adding iptables rules to the &quot;Custom&quot; section of the firewall tab in LuCI, but it doesn&#039;t appear to be working ( I don&#039;t see any packets hitting the ruleset ) Here are the rules I tried using as a test for one host:</p><p>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 1.2.3.4 -i eth0 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.10.12<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.10.12 -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 1.2.3.4<br />iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A FORWARD -t filter -i eth0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT</p><br /><p>Would someone mind giving me a hand with this?&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming all of this can be done in LUCI, but I&#039;m stuck at the moment.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>

					<p>Each one of the public IP&#039;s you want to 1 to 1 nat with attach them to the WAN(assuming eth0) interface with the ifconfig command.

					<p>ok, I tried it and it&#039;s still not working correctly.. after following your instructions the internet&nbsp; (via what&#039;s my ip) shows my host as coming from the DHCP assigned WAN address, instead of the public IP address that I want to do 1 to 1 with.&nbsp; At one point during my testing, after removing the -i eth0 and -o eth0 flags from IPtables rules you suggested, what&#039;s my ip showed the correct IP address for about 3 minutes.. then it stopped.&nbsp; Scratching my head at this point.</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>

					<p>Whatsmyip may not be the best way to test a 1 to 1 nat setup. 1 to 1 nat passes traffic sent to that IP address through to your internal IP but that doesn&#039;t mean it will use the 1 to 1 nat IP for outgoing connections to websites.

So basically, this isn&#039;t going to work in the way that a&nbsp; Cisco&nbsp; 1 to 1 NAT configuration would; with static mappings.&nbsp; I can live with that for now.&nbsp; My last and most important 2 questions are in regards to setting up the eth0 interface with public IP&#039;s.&nbsp; As I stated earlier, eth0 currently pulls a dynamically assigned IP address from my ISP via the Uverse modem.&nbsp; My questions are:</p><p>1. Do I still need to have eth0 pull the dynamic WAN address from the upstream modem?<br />2. Do I need to create alias/sub-interfaces on eth0 (eth0:1, eth0:2, etc.) for each of the public IP&#039;s I&#039;m going to assign?&nbsp; It seems as though each &#039;ifconfig&#039; statement would overwrite the previous addresses.</p><p>Thank you again so very much for all of your assistance.</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>
