					<p>Hello, <br />I am deciding if I want to build my own network at home. But I have a rather complicated setup and would like to know if it is possible to do this with Open WRT. <br />I am not completely new to networks, but I do not have an extensive knowledge either. </p><p>Currently I have a DOCSIS3.0 homegateway wireless modem from my ISP hooked up to a 24 ports gigabit switch. On 2 seperate locations in the house I have an access point for wireless. <br />The special thing about it are the digital TV boxes from the ISP. They run some kind of dual stack network with both an internal network (192.x) and an external network (10.x). The 192 network is used for in home streaming between devices. The 10 ip is used to do video on demand from the ISP directly.</p><p>It is important that the network for the digiboxes is not altered, they should at any time get an IP address from the home gateway from my ISP. But I would like to add a router between the modem from my ISP and my 24 port gigigabit switch. So I can do something more with my network (2 small children that are about to venture onto the internet). As all the devices are connected at different parts of the house, I would like the router to know who the digiboxes are and let them pass thru the router and get the IP address an data from the ISP&#039;s modem. </p><p>Is this possible with Open WRT ? Can you set it up so that for a select list of MAC ADDRESSES the IP is fetched from the modem from my ISP and not from the Open WRT router ? </p><p>As an addition to adding the router between the modem and switch, I would like to add a few new access points to my home network to improve the coverage. I would bring the total up to 4, and was thinking of letting them also run Open WRT to manage them. Is it possible to configure some kind of wireless handover of packages when you move out of range from 1 AP to another so that VOIP calls or streaming services do not get disconnected ?<br />A guest network would also be interesting for when someone comes over.</p><p>Can anyone tell me if this is possible ?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt uses dnsmasq for dhcp/dns. And dnsmasq is capable to ignore certain MAC addresses (--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,ignore)<br />So you should be able to give a pass way to your TV box.</p><p>To isolate the childrens network you can setup a VLAN on the switch. Other option is to move the new router *before* the switch. That gives you more options to control the environment offered.<br />For instance you could point them to use openDNS.&nbsp; Or your own white listed solution.<br />(if you move your router, than your problem of the TV boxes also go away.)</p>									</div>
