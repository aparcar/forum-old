					<p>I believe j808 is talking about the fact that he is using an IPv4-only VPN service, and when a host is resolved to an IPv6 address, the client makes a connection to the internet directly rather than via the VPN tunnel.</p><p>The real solution is to use a VPN service which supports IPv6, since OpenVPN already supports IPv6. However, OpenVPN will _not_ translate IPv6 to IPv4 (one would need something like NAT64 for that).</p>									</div>
