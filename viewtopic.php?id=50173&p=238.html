Maybe? Maybe not? It could be relevant for others however so stating that there&#039;s no reason to buy a faster, better version of a router isn&#039;t nice to those that could run into issues already.</p><p>Want to run some OpenVPN together with NAT on a gigabit internet-line? Yeah, you&#039;re already CPU bound on so many planes there it&#039;s not even funny. Encryption takes a fair chunk of CPU and so does NAT. Hopefully NAT can be solved using hardware acceleration in the future.</p><p>I don&#039;t buy a router based on exactly what I need to use right now and nothing faster, nor do I buy one based on some kind of average use on my router, I buy it based on that it should be able to be good enough to handle any peaks with ease and give me some headroom in case I do more in the future, but maybe that&#039;s just me.</p><p>// Stefan</p><p>EDIT: I bought the WRT1900AC because it does what I need it to do and gives me headroom for the future. I can already get an internet line that bogs the router down but I have no plans on upgrading to it, if I do in the future I&#039;ll solve that roadblock when I get there.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stesmi</strong> on 29 Jun 2015, 05:36)</p>

					<p>What througput are people getting with the Linksys 1900AC in a gigabit environment behind NAT?</p><p>I&#039;ve done some google searches but nothings come up.</p>									</div>

					<p>A few days ago, maybe a week, someone wrote they benchmarked it at 550Mbit/s I believe through the NAT, and that the CPU was flat out then.</p><p>Let&#039;s see if I can&#039;t find the quote.</p><p>// Stefan</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a way of testing gigabit behind NAT on the 1900ac. If I have time tomorrow, I&#039;ll do some testing and see what happens.</p>									</div>
