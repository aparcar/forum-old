					<p>@dfarning<br />I was able to do my own custom build (i.e. added packages like unbound and removed some cruft).&nbsp; Here&#039;s a rundown:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT
cd McWRT/attitude_adjustment/scripts/config &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; cd McWRT/attitude_adjustment
./update.sh
#select and deselect packages if you want, leave the defaults and exit saving changes if unsure.

make menuconfig 

#I was able to do a parallel build of my config without things breaking, if the build breaks (you don&#039;t end up with that image file at  the end just remove the &#039;-j&#039; parameter and run make again.  Oh, and make a noise or flash the terminal window if make exits   cleanly (the build succeeded).

make V=s -j&lt;no. of cpus&gt; &amp;&amp; echo -e &#039;\a&#039; </code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmilburn</strong> on 16 Sep 2014, 22:37)</p>

					<p>@OperatorOverload</p><p>As a workaround right now, you should be able to add your route in the corresponding protocol script (e.g. 6rd.sh in my case).&nbsp; It&#039;s similar to what nyt did, go to /lib/netifd/proto on your router, you should find the IPv6 tunneling scripts there.&nbsp; If you open up the script corresponding to the protocol you&#039;re using, there should be a function called proto_XXX_setup (where XXX is the protocol name).&nbsp; I don&#039;t have access to my router right now, so I can&#039;t give a good example, but you should be able to use the shell variables declared there to add your route inside that function.</p><p>I&#039;m going to try backporting the most current netifd daemon to see if that fixes my issues (I haven&#039;t spotted any problems with the scripts themselves). </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>nyt wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>And another AA fix since I noticed a default route was not getting added when I brought my tunnel up....<br />This one is kind of ugly <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>--- a/attitude_adjustment/package/6in4/files/6in4.sh
