					<p>I would like to adapt Openwrt to be a resilient mobile platform, capable of phoning home (as an openvpn client) by whatever means necessary. Here are some examples of what I mean:</p><p>* I booted openwrt while it was not connected (via the wan port) to a network segment with a dhcp server, and did not get a lease. When I did connected it to the rest of the network it did not attempt to get a dhcp lease later, I had to manually run ifup. I would like it to keep retrying automatically.<br />* I also would like the wireless to be in sta mode to connect to any nearby access points if possible, and try simple wep brute forcing too. This sounds like the job of a shell script on a cron job.<br />* I already have the timeout settings on openvpn set to retry indefinitely, so I do not have to restart openvpn when the connection comes up.</p><p>So, does anyone know if this has been done before? I couldn&#039;t find anything relevant. If not, is the best solution for me just to crack down and write my own babysitting shell script and put it on a cron job? I can do it but I was hoping I didn&#039;t have to reinvent the wheel.</p><p>Kyle</p>									</div>
