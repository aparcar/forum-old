					<p>I&#039;ve been using this previously but I never made notes about it so on every new release of openwrt, I had to do it again.&nbsp; I decided to take some time to write some stuff down, so I hope this will help some people who tries to do the same.<br />My goal is to be able to use my local network to connect my Sony Ericsson K660i to the internet using bluetooth NAP.&nbsp; My bluetooth stick is on a Linksys NSLU with openwrt 10.03.</p><p>First I had to install the needed packages: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg install bluez-utils  kmod-bluetooth kmod-usb-ohci dbus-utils</code></pre></div><p>Second there are some changes which has to be made to hcid.conf.&nbsp; Mine currently looks like this: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#
# HCI daemon configuration file.
#

# HCId options
options {
    # Automatically initialize new devices
    autoinit yes;

    # Security Manager mode
    #   none - Security manager disabled
    #   auto - Use local PIN for incoming connections
    #   user - Always ask user for a PIN
    #
    security auto;

    # Pairing mode
    #   none  - Pairing disabled
    #   multi - Allow pairing with already paired devices
    #   once  - Pair once and deny successive attempts
    pairing multi;

    # Default PIN code for incoming connections
    # passkey &quot;BlueZ&quot;;
    passkey &quot;0000&quot;;
}

# Default settings for HCI devices
device {
    # Local device name
    #   %d - device id
    #   %h - host name
    name &quot;%h&quot;;

    # Local device class
    class 0x020100;

    # Default packet type
    #pkt_type DH1,DM1,HV1;

    # Inquiry and Page scan
    iscan enable; pscan enable;

    # Default link mode
    #   none   - no specific policy 
    #   accept - always accept incoming connections
    #   master - become master on incoming connections,
    #            deny role switch on outgoing connections
    lm accept, master;

    # Default link policy
    #   none    - no specific policy

    lp rswitch,hold,sniff,park;
    
}</code></pre></div><p>You need to enable dbus and bluetooth: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/dbus enable
/etc/init.d/bluez-utils enable</code></pre></div><p>I just add the new bnep interface to the br-lan.&nbsp; To do this I created /etc/hotplug.d/net/20-bt with the next context:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>case &quot;$INTERFACE&quot; in
    bnep*) ;;
    *) return 0;;
esac

case &quot;$ACTION&quot; in
    add|register)
        ifconfig $INTERFACE up
        brctl addif br-lan $INTERFACE
    ;;
    remove|unregister)
        brctl delif br-lan $INTERFACE
        ifconfig $INTERFACE down
    ;;
esac</code></pre></div><p>At this point, you should be able to connect your mobile phone.&nbsp; I used dbus and the info on <a href="http://wiki.bluez.org/wiki/FAQ">http://wiki.bluez.org/wiki/FAQ</a> was usefull: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/hci0 org.bluez.Adapter.SetMode string:discoverable
dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/hci0 org.bluez.Adapter.SetDiscoverableTimeout uint32:60</code></pre></div><p>The first comment makes the NSLU discoverable, the next one sets the timeout to 60 seconds. If everything works as it should, you should now have a bnep0 added to your br-lan.</p><p>I hope this can help someone.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wimpunk</strong> on 10 May 2010, 17:32)</p>
