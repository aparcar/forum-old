					<p>one big problem with scp on a router is, that all traffic go through a ssh-connection and will be encrypted. The cpu of most routers are to slow too get an appropriate throughput. So you should think about an unencrypted connection. you could use ftp or rsync (or more specific rsyncd) for it, as duplicity has a backend for both. You don&#039;t need encrypted traffic because duplicity will only copy encrypted/signed tar-archive to the router.<br />Rsync has it&#039;s own user-database independend from the systemusers. <br />So if speed is an issues/concern look into duplicity and rsyncd, if you don&#039;t need more than 2-3MByte/sec scp will run just fine (but you should at least use publickey-authentication).</p><p>(update:) I just realised that you wrote about a server in the DMZ. So if you are really concerned about security implications of the fact that the &quot;unsecure&quot; webserver has root access on something outside the DMZ, or at least write-access (in case of rsync or ftp) you could run it like that: <br />duplicity on the webserver stores the backups somewhere on the webserver... start a rsyncd which will share this directory (readonly) and set up a cron job on the router to sync this directory. This would be a possible way to go if you take the DMZ seriously.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 19 Nov 2011, 17:20)</p>
