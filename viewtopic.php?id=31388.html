					<p>Can someone confirm for me that the WNDR3700 can do dual 2.4ghz?</p><p>I purchased a WNDR3700 on sale, and would like to set it up to do 802.11g on channel 1 and 802.11n on channel 11 of the 2.4ghz band. This was particularly hard to google for.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry...it is dual-radio, but only one radio operates in the 2.4GHz band.&nbsp; The other is 5GHz.&nbsp; I&#039;m not aware of an off-the-shelf router with two 2.4GHz radios.&nbsp; You&#039;d probably have to build your own based on a RouterStation or RouterBoard plus two wireless cards.</p>									</div>
