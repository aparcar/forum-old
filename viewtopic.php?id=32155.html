					<p>Hi i&#039;m running latest trunk ar71xx image (rspro) and have problems with blok-mount.<br />first - i&#039;m using sd card as overlay . SD card is mounted to /overlay only with option &#039;device&#039; /dev/sda1 , no way to mount usig UUID or label ...<br />second - i can&#039;t automount any usb drive partitions with fstab at all, no matter if i&#039;m using device name, uuid , or label- after reboot partitions is not mounted (manually mounts is working without any problems) . Even the same SD card that i can mount with fstab as root fs in any way can&#039;t be automounted as regular mount point&nbsp; ...</p><p>in rc5 backfire automounts worked without any problems , but there block-extroot and block-hotplug not merget with blok-mount - so this is another story ...</p><p>So i&#039;m doing something completely wrong, or blok-mount is broken in trunk ?</p><p>Thanks,<br />R.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t exactly know cause I don&#039;t use trunk but i think you must include the requiered packages for extroot (block-extroot, block-mount and hotplug). For mounting devices use the example in the fstab how to, check you have option enable 1, and you have set the target correctly, if you need it I can post my fstab config.</p>									</div>
