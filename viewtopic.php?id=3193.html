					<p>hi</p><p>i&#039;m using a whiterussion RC2 on a WRT54GS v1.1 and expand the WLAN with a WRE54G ver1 (without ethernet port) which is acually working perfectly.</p><p>linksys &quot;upgraded&quot;(?) their products and currently ship WRE54G ver.2 with an integrated fast ethernet port. i don&#039;t get them working: they do not expand my wlan instead they drop all packets from the notebooks which are connected to them.</p><p>i noticed that openwrt loaded a special interface (i forgot the name but it was no eth*, vlan* or br* device) with the old extenders. the new extenders (ver2) did not force openwrt to load this interface.</p><p>btw: the ip address of the extenders are very tough. i tried to change them to 192.168.192.240/24 via the web interface but only one of the three devices really changed to the new address... strange.</p><p>i tried all combinations of WRT54GS running both whiterussian RC2 and whiterussian RC3 with <br />WRE54G ver2 firmware 2.0.1.12 and&nbsp; and the initially installed firmware 2.02.05</p><p>another strange thing: the extenders come with a firmware: v2.02.05 and on the linksys.com website is only v2.0.1.12 for download available (which is less than the one installed)</p><p>i would be happy for any hint .. thanx!</p>									</div>
