					<p>Most likely there is something wrong in your config, so start configuring slowly. First enable both radios and see if they work. If yes, then config WPA &amp; passphrase etc. and only then try to touch the other radio settings.</p><p>Try my wndr3700 build. Both radios work in 3700v1, 3700v2 and 3800.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28392</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I noticed your post in Arokh&#039;s thread, but decided to answer here. </p><p>I am writing this message using the 5 GHz radio&nbsp; using a WNDR3700v1. My build, trunk 39450. It works quite normally, like it has for ages. Just tested both with 3700v1 and with 3800.</p><p>If the 5 GHz radio does not work for you with any of the Openwrt builds you have tried so far, then the problem might be somewhere either in your device itself or in your wifi config. (try as simple config as possible. do not even change the country selection. start settings from scratch.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 3 Feb 2014, 08:53)</p>
