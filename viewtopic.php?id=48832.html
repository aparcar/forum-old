					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to connect an *experimental Lab network* with some industrial controllers to the internet and connect to it using VPN.<br />Instead of spending a couple of hundreds of euros for an industrial routing device like a SIMATIC SCALANCE X623, I want to use OpenVPN to connect to my network and just buy a cheap OpenWRT-Device. </p><p>So I need a device which basically just needs to have one fast ethernet port for the external network and one for the internal network, is able to run a OpenWRT-release *in a very stable way*, acts as an OpenVPN-Server and does not slow down the network too much. I do need no WI-FI or ADSL-modem capabilities and other fancy stuff. An integrated 4-Port Switch would be better than just one Port but is not necessary, since I have a managed 8-port industrial switch here.</p><p>After some reading in the Hardware List, I think it is nearly impossible to find any device which that reduced functionality, so I ask you kindly to give me some advice which device I should buy regarding my described requirements. </p><p>It should of course not be too expensive. Maybe around 50 Euros or something.</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Raw openssl throughtput of $25 tl-wr841n v8 is ~5MB/s (40mbit) with aes 128, minus some VPN overhead, I&#039;d expect the real speed 10+ mbit. I think it&#039;s pretty good device for that price.
