					<p>I have a laptop Lenovo T530 with Win 8.1 x64, WiFI adapter Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 AGN.<br />The router is Linksys WRT1200AC with Openwrt 15.05.1 from downloads.openwrt.org + WiFi driver 10.3.0.17 (kmod-mwlwifi - 3.18.23+10.3.0.17-20160324-1).<br />Router to laptop distance is 2meters.<br />I am sending a very large file over WiFi from a fast NAS connected to the router to -&gt; the laptop.<br />The problem is that WiFi speed from the router to the laptop is negotiated according to Luci only:<br />TX RATE 150 Mbit/s, MCS7, 40MHz.&nbsp; <br />Actually I get &quot;only&quot; 12-13MB/s transfer in abovementioned config.<br />All other devices that I have are able to negotiate 160-300Mbit/s and MCS 15 (whatever MCS is). Actual transfers higher.<br />The faulty laptop also can negotiate MCS15/300Mbps when I boot it under Windows 7 x64 (there are two Windows in this laptop: Win7 and Win8.1 on separate hdds).<br />The faulty laptop under Win8.1 reaches only 150Mbps as said above, but connect it to a different router (Netgear) and it hits 300Mbit/s (theoretical speed, actually 20MB/s).<br />The faulty laptop under Win8.1 connects faster to the faulty router when there is original Linksys firmware.</p><p>An interesting thing is that however router negotiates with Windows 8.1 TX RATE only 150Mbps, but RX RATE is 300Mbit/s and MCS 15. The laptop clearly sends data to the router faster and receives slower.</p><p>Is there any possibility to force the router to reach higher &quot;MCS&quot; and (theoretical) transfer rate towards laptop faster then 150Mbit/s when there is Windows 8.1 running on the laptop?<br />I already tried other WiFi adapters in Laptop, other drivers on Windows - without any improvement. Unfortunately Lenovo limited working WiFi adapters to BIOS whitelist, and there is no&nbsp; option for any ac adapter - only abgn.</p><p>As I wrote above the problem does not exist when the laptop connects to other router (Netgear), or connects to the &quot;faulty&quot; Linksys WRT1200AC router from Windows 7.</p><p>Shell I forget about it or is there any way to improve Win8.1 transfer? (some magical entry in the Windows register or in the router&#039;s config?)</p>									</div>
