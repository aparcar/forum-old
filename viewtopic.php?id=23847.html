					<p>Could you recommend a router that has a usb2.0 port? I don&#039;t really want to spend $70 ( according to google thats Â£40).<br />It&#039;s just am on a tight budget. I only want it so I can download torrent / gnuttela network overnight without having leaving my pc on.<br />Also I can share my hp f380 printer with my sis.</p>									</div>

					<p>When looking for a supported WiFi router with a USB2 port, be sure the router has lots of RAM, i.e. 32MB. The more the RAM, the merrier the router will be to run/host more proggies.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m using a Netgear Wgt634u with Openwrt on it and I&#039;m quite happy with it.<br />Bittorrent (transmission) runs on it without a flaw.<br />It has 32MB Ram and 8MB Flash.<br />However it might be a liitle difficult to get one, cause it&#039;s end of life.<br />I got mine from the bay.<br />Alternatively this one might suit you too:<br />TP Link WR1043ND<br />Take a look at this thread:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22742">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=22742</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Bottom line is stretching to something like the WR1043ND would give you more value for money than an older router like the WGT634U. Just don&#039;t expect &#039;gigabit switch&#039; and &#039;USB 2&#039; to mean that it can read files from the USB storage at 1000Mbit/s or you&#039;ll be very disappointed (I get a maximum of 130Mbit/s doing a test read direct from the WR1043ND&#039;s memory using iperf, so reading USB storage at 100Mbit/s would be an absolute maximum, at a guess [compared to 220Mbit/s from my Buffalo Linkstation Live 1TB] - but the gigabit switch can pass traffic at a good speed).</p>									</div>
