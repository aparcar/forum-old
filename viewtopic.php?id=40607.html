					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>I managed to mount a &quot;Cloud drive&quot; (WebDAV partition) onto my OpenWrt-powered TP-Link TL-WR703N router.</p><p>What it means is that now I have virtually unlimited storage space on my cheap $22 small (57 x 57 x 18 mm or 1.25 x 1.25 x 0.7 &quot;), 4MB Flash, 32MB RAM, Wifi/+Ethernet-enabled pocket router!</p><p>Of course, this opens up a whole bunch of new possibilities...</p><p>The first thing I am thinking of is to mount this webshare partition as &quot;/overlay&quot;, so all the packages are installed on it rather than on the limited-size Flash. I may need to use an intermediate loopback file (i.e. a file containing a file system), because the WebDAV protocol doesn&#039;t support symbolic links, so I am not sure if I will be able to install packages on it as is.</p><p>Then, the flashed firmware becomes a &quot;bootstrap&quot; for the device, fetching all its packages from the Cloud. Moreover, you can imagine all your routers&nbsp; sharing the same Cloud drive, so you actually provision the same up-to-date firmware to all of them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>But I a m sure you already have your own idea of what to do with it!</p><p>The &quot;Cloud drive&quot; can be any provider supporting the WebDAV protocol, like &quot;4Shared.com&quot;, &quot;Box.com&quot; or &quot;Google Drive&quot; (I used &quot;4Shared.com&quot;), but it can also be your own private Cloud if you install <a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a> either on your machine or on a hosted server.</p><p>Although it requires to build your own firmware, the steps involved are not very difficult. They are not platform dependent, so they should work on all OpenWrt-supported devices. They are also not version dependent, as I tested the modification both using the &quot;Barrier Breaker&quot; trunk (r34243) and the Attitude Adjustment Beta 2 branch (rr34185).</p><p>As it may certainly be useful to others, I wanted to share it here!</p><h5>Install</h5><p>I suppose that you start from a (fresh) SVN checkout of OpenWrt, or maybe an existing one that you already have.<br />You only need to download the <a href="https://github.com/Squonk42/LinkDuino/blob/master/downloads/openwrt_webdav.tar.gz?raw=true">openwrt_webdav.tar.gz</a> archive and uncompress it anywhere you like. It will create&nbsp; a directory &quot;openwrt_webdav&quot; containing:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>openwrt_webdav

./script/feeds install -a</code></pre></div><p>We now need to apply the &quot;001-secrets-permissions.patch&quot; patch that adds the image &quot;/etc/davfs2/secrets&quot; files to the list of files to keep with unmodified access rights (it needs to be owner-rw only), by typing in the main OpenWrt directory:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>patch -p 0 &lt; your_unpack_dir/openwrt_webdav/001-secrets-permissions.patch</code></pre></div><p>Then, we need to copy the file &quot;002-write-chain.patch&quot; that gives the libneon the capability to dump the whole SSL certificate chain rather than the server certificate only. Still in the same OpwenWrt root directory:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cp your_unpack_dir/openwrt_webdav/002-write-chain.patch feeds/packages/libs/neon/patches/</code></pre></div><h5>Configuration / Compilation</h5><p>You just use the standard configuration command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make menuconfig</code></pre></div><p>If not already done, you need first to select your target device, then navigate to the &quot;Network &gt; Filesystem&quot; sub-menu to select the &quot;davfs2&quot; entry by typing &quot;Y&quot;. Save and exit, then launch the compilation using:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make -j n</code></pre></div><p>Where &quot;n&quot; is your number of host CPU + 1.</p><p>After a variable amount of time (that may be hours if it is the initial compilation that also builds the whole toolchain), you should obtain the firmware files in the &quot;bin/architecture&quot; directory.<br /></p><h5>Usage</h5><p>Install the appropriate firmware file onto your device, then proceed to the usual configuration of the root password to get SSH access, then configure the network to have access to your WebDAV server. I cannot go into too much details here, as this is very specific to each individual device/installation.</p><p>Once the network configuration set up, we will perform the WebDAV-specific setup. We have to:<br /></p><ol class="decimal"><li><p>add your WebDAV authentication information to the &quot;/etc/davfs2/secrets&quot; file</p></li><li><p>(optional) say we don&#039;t use locks, as this is the case, at least with the 4Shared.com provider</p></li><li><p>specify where to get the server certificate file</p></li></ol><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/etc/davfs2# echo &quot;/mnt your_login your_password&quot; &gt;&gt; secrets

					<p>One quiet bad thing about davfs2 is that fact, that it <strong>always</strong> uses local cache. And when I say always, I really mean this.</p><p>I have davfs2 up and running on my DIR-825 with USB flash drive attached. Cache of davfs2 should be set to USB mount, and I&#039;ll explain why. For example, when you try to copy an 1GB file from USB flash to davfs2 mounted directory, what do you think is going to happen? Will it just send the file to the remote server? <br />No!<br />1. It copies file from original directory on USB drive to cache directory on USB drive.<br />2. It puts file from cache directory to the remote server.<br />3. It deletes file from cache.<br />And there&#039;s no known way to stop it from using cache this way.</p><p>Similarly when you try to open a file stored on the remote server, it downloads it to the cache directory first and only then opens it from the cache.</p><p>Also you can imagine what would happen if you try to send or get large enough file when cache directory is set to /var/cache. If your router has only 32MB of RAM, you&#039;ll find that you can&#039;t do anything with files larger than 16MB. And if you try to do that, you will find your /var (and /tmp which is the same) partition with no free space left, and that&#039;s definitely not good for running linux system.</p><p>It would work well enough with smaller files, though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eximido</strong> on 19 Nov 2012, 15:42)</p>
