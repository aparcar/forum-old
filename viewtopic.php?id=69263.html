					<p>I&#039;m ready to return this router!<br />Keep it or get something else is my question?<br />I only have trouble with the wireless settings.</p><p>I purchased a new Linksys WRT AC3200 Open Source Dual-Band Gigabit Smart Wireless Router with MU-MIMO, Tri-Stream 160 (WRT3200ACM)and am using the stock firmware.</p><p>There are two websites on the wireless side that will not connect after 36 hours.<br />craigslist.org and nbcrightnow.com<br />additionally I have trouble connecting a Wii U until I rebooted the Router and Modem.<br />I have no problems with Ethernet connection.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure why everything would work fine for 36 hours then these two sites can not be accessed along with dropping the Wii U.<br />I&#039;ve used Windows10, Linux, Android and IOS.&nbsp; Wii U when it works.</p><p>I have called Linksys 3 times and live chatted three times with not luck.<br />I&#039;ve done the following:</p><p>Change the 2.4 GHz channel to 11 and set the bandwidth to 20Hz<br />Change the 5 GHz bandwidth to 40Hz. <br />Change the MTU to 1468<br />I do have port 80 and 443 forwarding. </p><p>Question:<br />I really used to like Linksys and have used dd-wrt.<br />Would I get better results with OpenWrt?<br />Is this router worth the money or is there another high end product that will work out of the box then be ready for upgrade with openwrt in time?</p><p>Thanks<br />cwc</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cwc1885</strong> on 7 Jan 2017, 19:15)</p>

					<p>Yup, its a qualcomm platform, there are a few routers available that are almost exactly the same (apart from different casing <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />), from tplink, linksys, ..etc</p><p>Myself running TP-Link Archer C2600.<br />If you plan to buy one, try to get rev 1.0.<br />V1.1 is ok too, but there is a bug, the bug is already fixed, but the fix is not in lede trunk yet..

					<p>cwc1885,</p><p>wave 2 is the latest generation, the next round of replace all your hardware <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> </p><p>That the performance degrades over time is a known issue with the new wifi chip in Rango, the older one had a similar issue in the past and some people used a cron job to restart the device once in a while which worked just fine for them till a good driver became available. There is reason to believe the driver will be fixed by Marvell but there is also reason to believe that this wont be tomorrow or next week.</p>									</div>
