					<p>Hi,</p><p>Does IPv4 forwarding work properly with OpenWrt? (Attitude Adjustment 12.09)</p><p>I have a laptop in my LAN as openVPN server. When I want to ping from external to a LAN host, the icmp request find their way to the LAN hosts (tcpdump is your friend). So that&#039;s fine. With a default static route on these LAN hosts back to the openVPN laptop for the remote subnet, the icmp replies also find their way back to the remote VPN client. So that&#039;s all peachy.</p><p>But I really don&#039;t want to go through the trouble of setting up a static route on all my LAN hosts. Unfortunately it doesn&#039;t work otherwise. I would have thought that it&#039;s sufficient to create the same static route on the OpenWrt router to the openVPN laptop for that subnet. But in his setup, the icmp request are received by router, but the icmp replies never make it to the network cable (again tcpdump).</p><p>Any clues? What makes this static route different for my LAN hosts compared to my OpenWrt router?</p><p>Just to remove all doubt:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@router:~# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1</code></pre></div><p>Thanks,<br />Ceaus</p>									</div>
