					<p>Hi David, thank you for amazing job!!!<br />My WRT3200ACM works better than before on last r6520 build.<br />But few days ago I changed Wi-Fi card on my laptop to Intel 9260NGW and can&#039;t connect it to router in 160Mhz mode.<br />Works great on 80Mhz only (~550 upload/download on speedtest).<br />I tryed all channels but it didn&#039;t work, laptop didn&#039;t see the network.<br />Perhaps someone in this forum has encountered this problem.<br />I think it&#039;s a intel&#039;s driver trouble (now installed last 20.40.0), but maybe I need add special setting or package.<br />Thankful in advance for any help in solving this problem.<br />Very intresting to run it on hi speed:)</p><p>P.S. Sorry for my English, it&#039;s not my own language.</p>									</div>

					<p>Bad news for me... spent all my time with isolating a cause or issue with latest build on my wrt1900ac/v2</p><p>Setting up wifi was not an easy chore. Created the interfaces for 2.4 and 5 and setup, but the wifi showed disabled or unassociated. Removed everything and reset up.&nbsp; Then was able to get the proper connection only on 2.4. But once I got 5GHz setup wifi won&#039;t assign ip, just sits there waiting.</p><p>May try a late Feb install to see what I am doing is wrong. Seems straight forward on both luci interfaces but it seems the new luci is a wee more forgiving on steps done in and around the menus.</p>									</div>

					<p>So folks are aware... the 3200acm support Tri-Stream mode which increased the band width from 80mhz to 160mhz. If you have clients that won&#039;t connect when in 160mhz mode, it&#039;s likely the device doesn&#039;t support the extra width.</p><p>Also, after initiating 160mhz width, please verify the interface comes up first. This is because part of the band is allocated for DFS. This means that part of the band has to be clear of radar signals before the interface will come up. If you are in an area where radar is consistently being detected, you may discover issues with consistent connectivity. If the interface doesn&#039;t come up, please check the system and kernel logs, as Wifi will log the reason why the interface didn&#039;t come up. &quot;Radar detected&quot; is one example you might find in the logs.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have also noticed in urban areas with saturated WiFi, that results in high RF interference the chip still has false positives on detected radar.</p><p>As of r6550, on the WRT3200ACM router overall and WiFi performance seems very stable. 2.4Ghz/5Ghz speeds for an assortment of devices and older Roku devices works quite perfectly close by or far away.</p>									</div>
