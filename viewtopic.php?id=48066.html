					<p>Hi,</p><p>My wifi has normal upload and ping but the download speed is always less then 15Mbps and sometimes even 1 Mbps =/ I&#039;ve tried all the settings but I don&#039;t know what would cause such a slow download but normal upload(10Mbps), a few weeks ago it was fine but now I don&#039;t know what changed to cause this.. if anybody has an idea as to what could cause this that&#039;d be great.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want help you must provide info that will encourage folk to consider your case. At the very least, identify your router and version of OpenWrt. </p><p>In particular, you need to clarify, at the very least, of you have (or have not) upgraded to a trunk version or upgraded from one trunk version to a later. Wifi and other systems are definitely affected from time to time within the development branch. In such a case, the answer is to try trunk latest.</p><p>If that is not the case, then.... no idea</p>									</div>

					<p>Please specify as much info as possible. This could be anything, if you are sure you have not changed anything, just try to switch different channel. In my case, exactly this was the interferrence on either of sides (Ap/client).</p>									</div>
