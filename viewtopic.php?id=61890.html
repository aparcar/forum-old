					<p>Hey All,</p><p>I wanted to create a set of Ethernet zones using a router and iptables/openvpn.</p><p>By using some low-price consumer router, I would want to use the upstream and typically four gigabit Ethernet ports to say things like:<br />Ethernet port 2 cannot communicate with Ethernet port 3<br />This ip and port on Ethernet port 1 can connect to that ip and port on Ethernet port 3, but only using this protocol.</p><p>What $50 router can I use which will give me:<br />- Continuously up-to-date OpenWrt<br />- Running sshd, openvpn and iptables<br />- Enough storage/usb overlay file system to save say a megabyte of certificates and configuration data<br />- Ability to configure itself to the desired state automatically at power on</p><p>Is it possible?<br />What router should I use?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openWrit</strong> on 1 Jan 2016, 21:37)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Any router that is supported with as much ram / flash with usb port.</p><p>A supported router will remain supported with daily (trunk updates) as long as there are no &#039;hardware related reasons for it not to.<br />sshd, openvpn, iptables will run, openvpn might be &#039;expensive&#039; in terms of load and might not be the fastest though.<br />You can attach any memory stick, mount it and use as storage to any router with USB port.<br />As this is linux, you can configure it as you want, configuraion will remain after reboot, also you can write custom scripts that can be run at startup to do what ever you want.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t it&#039;ll be possible to set specific rules for different Ethernet ports with a single home router, but you could do it with a cluster of routers. Perhaps there&#039;s an easier way, what are you trying to set up?</p>									</div>

Performance won&#039;t be great since the routers CPU will have to be involved in forwarding and firewalling, but the capability is there on most consumer routers that I&#039;ve used.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you don&#039;t need wireless the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter ER-X sounds like a good fit for what you are looking for.&nbsp; Support was recently added in trunk, but I haven&#039;t had time to verify if everything works yet.&nbsp; I&#039;m still using the stock firmware.</p>									</div>
