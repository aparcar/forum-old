Which is awesome.</p><p>The thing is, I&#039;ve been out of the loop regarding custom firmware flashing for the longest time now, and just reading the installation instructions seems somewhat intimidating.</p><p>Have any of you guys flashed a E4200 v2 lately? a little help (maybe like a quick step by step guide) would be beyond awesome.</p><p>Thanks guys.</p>									</div>

					<p>The complex installation procedure is only required on older releases (Chaos Calmer). For current trunk builds there is an image openwrt-kirkwood-linksys-viper-squashfs-factory.bin that you can flash directly from the Linksys firmware interface.</p>									</div>
