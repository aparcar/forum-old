					<p>Is it possible, and is there an example configuration anywhere, of VLAN trunking with a Cisco IOS based switch? I have KAMIKAZE (7.07) running on a Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 (BCM5352 rev0).</p><p>I have three VLAN&#039;s (100/200/300) on my Cisco 3750 and I&#039;d like to configure one port on it as a trunk to my Openwrt&nbsp; -I don&#039;t use the WAN interface on the Openwrt, so that&#039;d be a handy trunk port for me? </p><p>A quick initial look seems like I might need the following on my IOS switch for the designated trunk interface:</p><p>switchport mode trunk<br />switchport nonegotiate<br />switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q<br />switchport trunk allowed vlan add 100<br />switchport trunk allowed vlan add 300</p><p>Anything else? Do I need to set the default vlan (switchport access vlan X) and the native vlan (switchport trunk native vlan X)?</p><p>What about the Openwrt side? It looks like the webif only allows vlans 0-9, and not anything greater? Is that a web interface limitation or must my VLAN number really be in that range? Can I just edit /etc/config/network, something like this:</p><p>#### VLAN configuration<br />config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 1 5*&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan100&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;3 4 5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan300&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;2 4 5*&#039;</p><p>Would this make Port 4 (WAN?) able to trunk vlan100 and 300, and port 3 as a member of just vlan100, and port 2 as a member of vlan 300?</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fihzy</strong> on 8 Dec 2007, 16:51)</p>

					<p>Well a couple of hours of experimenting (and learning how to use the failsafe mode) and I finally figured it out myself. I renumbered my VLANs; it seemed required at the time but now I see that probably wasn&#039;t necessary. I also turned off the firewall S45 script. Again I don&#039;t know if that was strictly necessary but I don&#039;t need the firewall anyway.&nbsp; My IOS switch has an interface configured to trunk vlan 7 &amp; 9 to the WAN port on the WRT54GL. The 54G then has port 4 configured to tag for vlan 7/8/9, ports 1,2,3 configured for vlan 7, and port 0 configured for vlan 9. It appears to work well. If anyone can spot any potential issues please let me know. Do I need to do anything about MTU? </p><p>Hope this helps someone.</p><p>Here are my configurations:</p><p>IOS:</p><p>interface FastEthernet1/0/7<br /> description Trunk to WRT54GL<br /> switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q<br /> switchport trunk allowed vlan 7,9<br /> switchport mode trunk<br /> switchport nonegotiate<br />!</p><p>54GL:</p><p>config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan1&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan2&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan3&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan4&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan5&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan6&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan7&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;1 2 3 4t 5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan8&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;4t 5*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan9&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;0 4t 5*&#039;</p><br /><p>#### Loopback configuration<br />config interface loopback<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;lo&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;127.0.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.0.0.0</p><br /><p>#### LAN configuration<br />config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.7&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;192.168.0.3&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway&nbsp; &#039;192.168.0.1&#039;</p><br /><p>#### WAN configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.8&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;none&#039;</p>									</div>
