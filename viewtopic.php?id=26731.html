					<p>Right now I have a setup using my old wifi ap as a dumb bridge between wifi and wired, and my server as dhcp server, where I have seperated my ip range (192.168.2.0/24) into 3 pools, like the following</p><p>1..127 fixed ip addresses<br />128..192 Parrent IP addresses (full internet access)<br />192..240 Children / guests (full access to internal network, filtered internet)</p><p>I have achieved the above by listing MAC&#039;s of the devices that should get an address in the parrent/full internetaccess group, in my dhcpd.conf file. I&#039;m forcing the kids through a transparrent proxy running dansguardian.</p><p>Now I want to move it on to an openwrt solution, and have bought a netgear wndr3700. I also wanted to have a guest network that I could enable when we have guests that want to use the internet.</p><p>I thought about creating 3 different wlans :<br />1. Parrents (full internal and internet access)<br />2. Kids (full internal, limited internet access)<br />3. Guests (no internal (except port 80) but full internet access)</p><p>This could make my day easier, as I don&#039;t have to go poking arround in my dhcp settings file everytime I have a guest that needs internet connection.</p><p>I assume that I can make 3 &quot;seperate&quot; wlan networks available on my wndr3700, but how should I wire them together &quot;behind the scenes&quot; in openwrt? Should I make a seperate network for each wlan, and assign a dhcp server to each of them? (only thing is that Kids and Parrents should behave as one network on the lan side.)</p><p>Any pointers to what documentation I need to read?</p><p>Regards<br />Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so after digging through a lot of webpages, it seems that I can&#039;t get the hardware to run multiple ssid&#039;s with encryption, due to a bug in ath9k.</p><p>So multiple virtual wlans is probably not the way ahead right now.</p><p>The question is then, how can I get my initial scenario made, the easiest way?</p><p>Should I set a fixed ip address in the dhcp server for the kids computers, so they go into a range, where they are forced through dansguardian?</p><p>How should the zones be defined for the firewall, so that I can have different access restrictions on the different computers (Kids should be forced through a dansguardian setup).</p><p>Any sugestions on how to get on with my project?</p><p>Regards<br />Thomas</p>									</div>
