					<p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; Some students in my school are makin a robot as end-year project. That&#039;s so much seen&#039;n&#039;boring...</p><p>&nbsp; So I wander, since their robot can be controler via RS232, and since it&#039;s possible to add RS232 to my WRT54G, is the WRT processor powerfull enough to run a small http server (of course, it already does), that run PHP (I would prefere JSP but...), make a few calculation, end send some commands in background to RS232. This way, I would add wifi programming and real-time correction to their robot, and the harder part of the work would be the design of the web interface. That would certainly impress the professors and they would get better grades easily. And I will have some fun too <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>&nbsp; So, the only real-question&nbsp; is, can a WRT54G make a few calcul (arcsinus, estimation of position, ...) while still running the FTP server to allow real-time correction (and maybe monitoring) ? Do you think it&#039;s a good idea ? The robot runs with microcontrolers only (I would have recomanded PXA 250 with linux and a USB-WIFI adaptator !), so the only cheap solution I would see to add a web-interface to it is my old WRT... Any luck ?</p><p>Regards,<br />Jaune.</p>									</div>
