					<p>Hi.</p><p>I&#039;ve installed OpenWRT on my WL-500gP. Everything works fine except the Wifi-Connection. It&#039;s sometimes getting very slow. <br />Normally i have a very good connection and about 28.0 Mbits/sec throughput with UDP-packages(measured with iperf). But sometimes it is limited to only about 1Mbit/sec and this holds on till i reset the Wifi-Connection. I&#039;ve tried Kamikaze 7.09 and compiled also the latest SVN-source.</p><p>I am in the same room with the ap and the signal quality is good. That doesn&#039;t change when the connection is getting so slow. I usually use the Wifi only with my notebook. The notebook has a ipw3945 Wifi-card built in. I use Arch Linux on it.</p><p>Here is some further information:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>iwconfig<br />wl0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IEEE 802.11-DS&nbsp; ESSID:&quot;flynet&quot;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mode:Master&nbsp; Frequency:2.432 GHz&nbsp; Access Point: 00:1B:FC:81:6F:3B&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate=54 Mb/s&nbsp; &nbsp;Tx-Power:18 dBm&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Retry min limit:7&nbsp; &nbsp;RTS thr:off&nbsp; &nbsp;Fragment thr:off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link Quality:5&nbsp; Signal level:0&nbsp; Noise level:158<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rx invalid nwid:0&nbsp; Rx <strong>invalid crypt:21475</strong>&nbsp; Rx invalid frag:0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Tx excessive retries:405 </strong> Invalid misc:0&nbsp; &nbsp;Missed beacon:0</p></blockquote></div><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>cat /etc/config/wireless<br />config wifi-device&nbsp; wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option channel&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;5&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option disabled&nbsp; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option device&nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option network lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;flynet<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option hidden&nbsp; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option isolate &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;&lt;mykey&gt;&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="http://privatepaste.com/76ALgyNOm5">Here is the output of dmesg.</a></p><p>Does anybody have an idea where the problem could be?</p>									</div>

					<p>I have quite similar problem with an Asus WL500g premium. The throughput of wireless connection does not exceed 600 KB/sec; neither from USB HDD attached to router, neither from other computer wired in LAN to router or from WAN. Interesting the wired client has a transfer rat of 3MB/sec.<br />Isn&#039;t there a way to fix this othar than replace the broadcom nic ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, <br />Yesterday I&#039;ve spent few hours trying different versions but I didn&#039; find one satisfactorry from every point<br />- snapshot from openwrt site (28.08.2008) (bleeding edge, r12419) does not allow the autenthication in x-wrt (I know, it seems to be fixed in 12422, but ...)<br />- snapshot from x-wrt site (OpenWrt Kamikaze - With X-Wrt Extensions bleeding edge, r12536 - Linux 2.4.35.4 #3 Fri Sep 5 07:08:00 CDT 2008&nbsp; - base-files-brcm-2.4 - 13-r12536) (curently I have this one) does not display the window for user and password when accessing web interface, it just displays &quot;Username&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not logged in&quot;&nbsp; - webif 4436 - and no menu is displayed on the top&nbsp; of page<br />- version 7.09 from x-wrt site dated sept 2008 (base-files-brcm-2.4 - 10-12536) works ok but it has the same poor performance on wireless<br />So, by now it seems that I have to choose either to have good performance or graphical interface. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />Do you have other suggestions?</p><p>Cheers,<br />ibrahim</p>									</div>
