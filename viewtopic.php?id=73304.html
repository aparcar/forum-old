					<p>Basically i posted on here a while ago and i have left it since then but i have acknowledged that open wrt is on the router and it sets up a open wireless network called open wrt with no password so i connect and try all ip dresses to try to open the control panel but none work and my mac discovers multiple ip addresses but i try all of them and it just keeps trying to access them as if something is there but the router is not posting me through to the control panel , i have scanned it and it detected it has tried to use services such as ssh secure shell login and 53 domain name server . could anyone help or please refer me to an actual support email for open wrt thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>You could try telnet, which was used in older versions of OpenWrt. But if that doesn&#039;t work, it&#039;s probably easiest to connect to the serial console.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have scanned it you know what the IP address is, it is 192.168.1.1 by default.&nbsp; If you flashed a &quot;trunk&quot; build, the only way to log in is by ssh.&nbsp; The scan should have revealed port 22 is open.&nbsp; That port is the standard one for ssh.&nbsp; Telnet uses port 23.</p>									</div>
