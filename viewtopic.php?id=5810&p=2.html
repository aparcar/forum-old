					<p>I&#039;ve just installed Whiterussian RC6 on my WRT54G v2.2 and seem to be having problems when I mount my SD card using the mmc.o module.<br/>Once I mount the SD card my router command line seems to lock up on me.&nbsp; The router is still operating like normal and passing traffic on the LAN and Wireless, but the command line locks up and eventually my SSH session times out.&nbsp; When I try to reconnect the connection times out, even though I can ping the router.&nbsp; <br/>Has anyone else loaded RC6 and had any problems with the mmc.o module?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hy. I have a wrt54gl v1.1 rouer (gpio 2 intead of 5). I tried every mmc driver theat i could find. All the 1.3 versions of the driver, are installed and mounted without no errors but when i try to write on the card, i get write error message. I wil tri the forum99 driver cause is the only one that i didn&#039;t try. I&#039;m not very good at electronic syuf but i&#039;m sure the solgering is good. How can i check that gpio 3 and 4 are not switch? Using older versions of the mmc driver with gpio 2, i get the -1 error. I s it posble this behaviour to be because that the gpio 3 adn 4 are switched? I have white russion 0.9</p>									</div>
