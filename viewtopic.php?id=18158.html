					<p>Hi,<br />I&nbsp; &nbsp;was running a p2p link for a short distance. The ap were wp54 + openwrt built on 24th august 2008. I don&#039;t know for what reasons client stopped saving any configuration after 3 months giving the error &quot;media full&quot;. I tried with webif file editor. It failed to save the file and deleted the network config file. I changed the ap (client side) with same configuration. The ap side was running hal 10.5.6 built by sam leiffer and client was running with latest hal built by nbd + sebastian etc. The link was good with SNR 39 but ping dropped to 90% where as it was running ok before changing the station side with newer wrt. Could this be incompatibility ?. Why the media got full after 3 months of operations.<br />regards<br />norms</p>									</div>
