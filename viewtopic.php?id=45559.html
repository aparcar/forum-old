					<p>I have slight troubles with the TL-WR740N right now. I flashed OpenWRT on it and it worked flawlessly. SSH and LUCI was working, so everything was okay.</p><p>Then, I opened the device and removed the LEDs - I am planing to use the GPIOs for some other stuff - and tried turning on the device again. But the ethernet-ports did not come up. So I checked the serial console, but also there, I did not get much output. </p><p>After a second check, I noticed that I must have removed the bootstrapping-resistors that are right next to the LED resistors. So I replaced them all with new 10k-resistors in the right places (the old ones got lost) and booted the router again. Result:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Mar 22 2013 - 16:16:35)

					<p>You&#039;re right.</p><p>On this picture, the red dots indicate the resistors that were removed but replaced with new 10k ones, the yellowish-white ones mark the led resistors that I replaced with soldering bridges:</p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/BGMBTTj"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BGMBTTj.jpg?1" alt="http://i.imgur.com/BGMBTTj.jpg?1" /></span></a></p><br /><p>And this picture shows the current state:<br /><a href="http://imgur.com/v5XQh4j"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/v5XQh4j.jpg?1" alt="http://i.imgur.com/v5XQh4j.jpg?1" /></span></a></p><br /><p>Also, I tried connecting all the LEDs with their resistors again (on a Breedboard), but that did not help at all. The LEDs all illuminated when the serial said &quot;flashing LEDs for 1 second&quot; though, so I asume that everything is correct there - except maybe some wrong resistor values for the bootstrapping?</p><p>Or is it possible that the undefined state affected the Boot-ROM? But how could I reflash the Bootloader then? I don&#039;t even see an option for a jtag.</p>									</div>

					<p>To verify that the flash-content did not get changed with the wrong bootstrapping, I flashed pepes U-Boot-Image into the bootloader-area of the Flash. (I used flashrom for that) It obviously worked, but I still am stuck on the same problem:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>*****************************************

I would JTAG this thing, but unfortunately, the JTAG-Pins are pretty hard to access and I&#039;m not sure if that would help all that much anyway.</p><br /><p>Edit: And just when I send this, I played a bit with the power-button of the router (pretty fast on-off-on and so on) and all of a sudden, it booted? I guess I have to figure out the right bootstrapping from a second device.</p><p>Edit2: However, I cannot get any ethernet connection on the device. Seems like the ethernet is dead in the SoC.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>locutus</strong> on 2 Aug 2013, 21:46)</p>
