					<p>maybe get a better gain antenna.. or directional one.. or put the antenna on a high long pole.. also keep in mind that high power=high noise and you also have to hack receiver device power of transmit(phone, laptop.. etc as they also have max transmit power 100mW)</p><p>regarding wifi.. i find it much better(signal, stability) since i restart wifi once a day</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 31 Oct 2015, 16:24)</p>
