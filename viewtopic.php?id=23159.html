Moreover older driver was able to bring up 80211a network, but not 80211na network (both in ap mode) and also ad-hoc worked fine on 5Ghz.</p><p>Am I doing sth wrong here or in configuration or maybe driver are faulty?</p><p>Thanks in advice for any suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Isn&#039;t AR9220 2.4 GHZ only? I tought you needed AR9223 to get 5 GHz. I was planning to get one of those cards from ebay when the driver become stable enough. Maybe you have one of those 2 chips cards (AR9220+AR9223)? You are talking about a radio0 interface. Do you also have a radio1?</p>									</div>

					<p>Very interested in your adhoc results. Can you comment on speeds you obtained since HT speeds are not available in adhoc yet. Any information on commands you used to setup adhoc would be great also, bounce them off what I have been working with. Also, do you hide the SSID? I couldn&#039;t seem to get something like addemo working since I really don&#039;t need beacon&#039;s or anything special. I run specific channels.</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I remember I&#039;ve just changed mode to adhoc on both radios as one and only interface and fixed channel. There was no special voodoo stuff. I will update this post with configuration tomorrow.<br />The transfer rate was about 22Mbits (measured with iptraf) for 2.4GHz and slightly faster on 5GHz.

					<p>Ok, sounds good, just stinks I&#039;m getting about the same with G using aftermarket mini pci card&#039;s/madwifi/adhoc/5ghz. I guess the benefit&#039;s might come in the forum of range, correct power settings, and faster speed once N speed is allowed in adhoc mode, if that&#039;s even possible. I&#039;m actually curious how Atheros turbo G performs in the 5ghz range on adhoc, never see anyone commenting about that and info on turbo mode is next to none.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just noticed your using the 2010 compat wireless. I tried that the other day and the card would not come up at all, showed all kind&#039;s of error messages. I&#039;ll rebuild today and post the exact details. Just wondering, with the 2.6.28 kernel being removed from trunk that doesn&#039;t mean newer compat wireless will not work does it?</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried r19147 because there are&nbsp; a lots of ath9k-changes. I ran into a similar problem, that I couldn&#039;t enable the wifi. <br />It seems like you need the crda package installed if you enable &quot;Force Atheros drivers to repect user&#039;s regdomain settings&quot; after that and setting the country in /etc/conf/wireless it is working for me.

Now, I use ath9k for the r52n and madwifi for the 2,4GHz 11g card, and both are working.&nbsp; <br />So I guess the problem with multiple cards isn&#039;t ath9k specific but atheros- (ath5k and ath9k) or mac80211-specific.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m using r19147 with kernel 2.6.30.10 on a routerstation pro (ar71xx).<br />But I have to correct my last post, the ath9k driver is ignoring my regdomain setting. It seems like it is using the settings for my country (AT) (dmesg output) but it doesn&#039;t. so now I&#039;m stucked with the us regdomain setting, and can only use 5170000 KHz - 5250000 KHz with 17dBm. If I try to use other 11a channels I get an error. It&#039;s okay for me at the moment, but it&#039;s not really working as it should.</p>									</div>

But&nbsp; for the other 11a frequenzies I would need radar detection (at least in Austria). So I guess it doesn&#039;t work, because using this channels with ath9k would be illegal at the moment.</p>									</div>

					<p>Note that the ath9k devices in general are not calibrated for frequencies outside the regulatory domain in the eeprom. Thus, using channels outside the regulatory domain means likely that the TX side is out of spec. This can cause disturbances to other traffic, possibly outside the ISM band.</p>									</div>

					<p>Alittle off topic, but does anyone know for sure if trying to set power at lower levels is supported in ath9k 5ghz using the R52N or in 2.4ghz with the R2N. Bascially does setting option txpower actually do anything? I tried to set it and it showed 20dbm instead of 27dbm when running iwconfig, but I have no idea if that is actually accurate. Just trying to fine tune 5ghz and 2.4ghz.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
