					<p>This is a dir-320 with backfire-10.03.1 image made with Imagebuilder. I have the wan port plugged to an upstream router running dhcp. The dir-320 is set to dhcp. The wan port doesn&#039;t connect automatically or manually. It does show traffic passed in both directions but interface uptime stays at zero and I have no upstream connectivity. </p><p>I have this same configuration using a tl-wr741nd working.</p><p>What could be the cause of this?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Perazim</p>									</div>
