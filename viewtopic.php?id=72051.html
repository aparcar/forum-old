					<p>There&#039;s been <a href="https://git.lede-project.org/?p=source.git&amp;a=search&amp;h=HEAD&amp;st=commit&amp;s=ath9k">a lot of tweaks and fixes</a> to the ath9k functionality in the LEDE source tree. Your router is supported by LEDE, as well, so I recommend giving it a spin.</p><p>Remember to &quot;forget config&quot; when doing the upgrade, as sometimes the OpenWRT configs are not compatible with LEDE&#039;s corresponding ones. It&#039;s easier to start from scratch.</p>									</div>
