					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a wifi repeater FRITZ!WLAN Repeater 1750E, which is good and is working perfectly with my old router DLink 865L.</p><p>If I connect this repeater to my Zyxel NBG6816 (OpenWrt-based), I can access my LAN DLNA server when my mobile connects wifi from the NBG6816, but I cannot access DLNA server from the repeater. If I restart the NBG6816, the thing is opposite: I can access the DLNA server from the repeater but cannot access from the NBG6816. It seems I cannot change my first connecting point to the DLNA server. If I first connect DLNA server from NBG6816 after NBG6816 reboot, then I cannot connect DLNA from repeater wifi and vice versa. It is really annoying. Does someone have any idea how to solve this? Many Thanks!</p>									</div>
