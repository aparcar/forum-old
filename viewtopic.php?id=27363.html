					<p>ciao Riccardo,</p><p>yes you can build gcc, provided that:<br />- you build x86 target<br />- select NO_STRIP option<br />in that case just select devel/build-essential package (gcc, binutils, ...)</p><p>But: packages are big, i.e. not suitable for embedded devices; i tried too and working gcc compiler, but linking doesn&#039;t work.<br />Cross compiling is simpler (after the setup *g*). You can then cross compile on a linux machine and mount on the target platform through sshfs, executing directly the brand new generated binaries. That&#039;s how i do it.</p><p>If you are new to cross compiling, i can show you needed compiler cmd / flags / env variables.</p>									</div>

					<p>At one time I had openwrt installed on a flash card on a 667Mhz single board computer. Now that booted up right swift!</p><p>Anyway, of course having an 8G flash card available as well as 667Mhz CPU and 256M/512M of ram as well as sound, video, mouse/keyboard, and all the bells and whistles, -- of course I wanted GCC on there.</p><p>But I could never find a tutorial that worked for either getting GCC installed on the openwrt box nor could I find a tutorial that worked on setting up a cross compiling platform.</p><p>So eventually I just put slackware on there! I was able to modify slackware so that it runs the flash card in read-only mode, and saves logs to ramdisk.</p><p>I also made a one-liner bash script pair so I could type &quot;rw&quot; to change the filesystem to read-write in case I wanted to make modifications, then I could type &quot;ro&quot; to change it back to read-only mode.</p><p>But now I have my GCC :-)</p><p>-Jesse</p>									</div>
