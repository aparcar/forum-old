					<p>I have 2 Linksys WRT54GL routers that I had set up with kamikaze 7.09 (2.4 kernels) in WDS mode. I&#039;ve just tried updating one of them to 8.09, using the 2.6 kernel.</p><p>Since I was having problems, I decided to take a step back and just set up the upgraded router in &quot;sta&quot; mode first. The main issue I&#039;m seeing is that in contrast to the 2.4 kernel, the 2.6 kernel gives a different MAC address to the wired and wireless interfaces.</p><p>When I bridge both interfaces together, then the wireless seems to no longer work. If I try to ping the other router, then I see ARP requests and ping attempts go out on the wired interface only. If I do something like this from the upgraded router (trying to arping over the bridged wireless interface):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># arping -I wlan0 192.168.2.1</code></pre></div><p>...then on the other router sees the arp packets and sends replies, but the &quot;client&quot; never seems to recognize the responses.</p><p>...if I then do this on the upgraded router:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># ifconfig br-lan hw ether &lt;mac_address_of_wireless_if&gt;</code></pre></div><p>then I can ping the other router from the &quot;sta&quot; router. Packets from wired hosts connected to the sta router don&#039;t seem to actually work though.</p><p>So I think I&#039;ve got a workaround for now. I have a script that sets the mac addr of the bridge to that of the wireless interface. My first question is -- is there a better way to do this? I tried setting &quot;option macaddr&quot; on the bridge definition in /etc/config/network, but it didn&#039;t seem to actually do anything.</p><p>When I try to flip everything to use WDS though, it doesn&#039;t work. as anyone actually gotten WDS mode to work with brcm47xx? I&#039;m willing to experiment with this some if someone can point me in the right direction.</p><p>Here&#039;s my /etc/config/network:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### VLAN configuration

					<p>I&#039;d agree -- any sort of bridging seems to be horribly broken in 8.09.&nbsp; Part of the reason I was switching to OWRT was for the simplicity of not running things I didn&#039;t need to on an already limited hardware platform.&nbsp; WDS and client modes do not work for me.&nbsp; I can get the hardware to connect, however when doing testing I see that although my RX rate is fine my TX rate never goes above 1Mbps.&nbsp; Something is definitely broken.</p><p>--windexh8er</p>									</div>
