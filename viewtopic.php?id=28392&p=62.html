Apparently some new powersave functions were buggy. The first bug (introduced by r1482 on 20160902) was fixed in late September ( <a href="https://bugs.lede-project.org/index.php?do=details&amp;task_id=176">https://bugs.lede-project.org/index.php … ask_id=176</a> ) , but then apparently a new bug was introduced in mid-October when the upstream wifi driver was updated.

But it is quite possible as in the early days there were rumours that radios in some batch were unstable.

Commit log here is rather empty. There is some activity by a few enthusiasts for the wrt1900/1200/3200ac family but otherwise not much. Some backports from LEDE to keep package feed repos compatible.</p><p>Personally I have been more active with Netgear R7800 for which I have started a community build on LEDE. <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/build-for-netgear-r7800/316">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/build- … -r7800/316</a></p><p>LEDE 17.01 has branched and should be published this month. That would be a good option to pickup/restart your activity.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 19 Jan 2017, 05:16)</p>
