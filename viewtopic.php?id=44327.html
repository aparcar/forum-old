					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m using Openwrt, when I change a file on the target, for example /etc/config/wireless, or /etc/config/network etc. Then I need to reflash the target with the factory or sysupgrade, then those files get wiped out and replaced with the files from the factory or sysupgrade.</p><p>Is there a way, after flashing with factory or sysupgrade, to get the files I changed while on the target back? Can it be saved somewhere that doesnt get erased when I reflash with factory or sysupgrade?</p><p>thanks<br />rough</p>									</div>
