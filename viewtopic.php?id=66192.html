					<p>So I got my Nexx wt3020. I was hoping the built-in firmware might have a client mode option, since that is the main usage scenario for this device for the immediate future. Being uncertain about whether the firmware would have that capability, I was pretty sure openwrt, which is compatible with this device, would. The built-in firmware lacked it, so I&#039;ve now flashed the device with openwrt and am preparing to implement client mode.</p><p>As a brief summary, what I need this device to do is hand out IP&#039;s on its two wired NIC&#039;s on its own little subnet, and to route the wifi signal it picks up on its wifi interface to/from those NIC&#039;s. It&#039;s to be deployed on an older computer I need to use from time to time, a unit onto which I&#039;ve installed a GNU/Linux version; it lacks a wifi interface. So I want to hook the Nexx to its ethernet port, thereby allowing it to get a network connection via the Nexx&#039;s wifi interface. I don&#039;t care whether the AP to which it connects knows about the Nexx&#039;s subnet. I hope that description is comprehensible.</p><p>I should mention I went through, using openwrt on a different router, a process a lot like this a few years ago. And I&#039;m pretty sure I used directives I found at <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient,">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient,</a> though I do not, of course, recall all the details. That page gives directives that involve logging in via ssh and editing various config files. That&#039;s kind of appealing to me since I find it a lot less confusing that trying to puzzle out all the aspects of the web gui, what they do, and if/how I need to revise them. </p><p>So, is <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a> the right resource to use for this project? Why, incidentally, does that document offer only directives for implementing client mode via ssh, not saying anything about how to implement this setting through the web admin page?</p>									</div>

					<p>routed client recipe is for &quot;repeater&quot; client mode to allow wired client to be in the same subnet as other main AP clients</p><p>it also called &quot;bridge&quot; mode</p><p>but as i can understand from your post, you need only to give an internet access to the old pc via main AP, sou you can use so called WISP (Wireless ISP) mode which can be implemented from the openwrt web gui easilly<br />just search for the ap, press connect and enter new interface name like &quot;wwan&quot; and assign it to nexx&#039;s wan zone<br />your old pc will have an internet connectivity but also it will be inside &quot;nexx&#039;s subnet&quot; and behind the nexx&#039;s NAT<br />other clients will have no ability of direct connection to old pc in this case.<br />but be careful, nexx&#039;s subnet and main AP subnet can&#039;t be the same</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 13 Jul 2016, 20:40)</p>

					<p>Thanks for your input, stas2z. If this can be done through the web admin interface as simply as you&#039;ve described it, I&#039;ll be delighted. Haven&#039;t had time yet to try the configuration suggestions, but will report back when I&#039;m ready to tackle this.</p><p>Meantime, are you sure the recipe I linked to aims to get wired interfaces hooked to the target wifi router&#039;s rj45 jacks, IP&#039;s on the same subnet as the AP to which its wifi interface connects? That&#039;s not what I get out of that article. And, if I&#039;m recalling correctly, when I previously implemented those directives (using a different target router), I had to establish a different subnet on the target router in order for the scheme to work. That said, I&#039;m far from being any kind of expert in these matters and could well be misunderstanding or overlooking something.</p><p>More later.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found some time tonight to try out stas2z&#039;s suggestion and he&#039;s right; this was very easy. I just went to Network &gt; Wifi &gt; Scan in the web admin interface, which found the AP I was intending to connect to. Then, I clicked on &quot;Join,&quot; where I needed to enter the wifi password. The new interface wwan (I guess it&#039;s a virtual interface?) is actually set to be created by default, and it&#039;s also set to be assigned to the WAN firewall zone by default as well, so I didn&#039;t have to fiddle with any of those settings. Once I&#039;d done that, I just reissued a dhcp request on the wired network by which I was connected to the Nexx and, voila, I was connected by wifi to the AP via the computer&#039;s wired NIC (hooked to the Nexx, of course). So, really simple.</p><p>So I can use the LAN port on the Nexx for this sort of connection to the AP, which should probably suffice for my purposes. Should I ever want to hook something to the WAN port on the Nexx in order to get it connected to wifi via the Nexx&#039;s wifi interface as well, would that be possible? Or is that port just going to have to be for decoration now?</p><p>LATER EDIT: forgot to add that I&#039;d also taken the preliminary step, as advised, of making sure the LAN interface was on a different subnet than that opf the wifi network to which I&#039;d be connecting. That was done by going to Network &gt; Interfaces &gt; LAN &gt; Edit, if memory serves.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wayover13</strong> on 15 Jul 2016, 18:15)</p>

					<p>you can reassign it as lan at the switch settings page<br />find port where vlan2 set to untagged and vlan 1 to off and make it untagged for vlan 1 and off for vlan 2 (mirror vlan settings)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stas2z</strong> on 15 Jul 2016, 08:50)</p>
