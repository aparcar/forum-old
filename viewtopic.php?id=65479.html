					<p>Hi,</p><p>[firmware installed: latest barrier breaker]</p><p>I used the router as an wireless adapter: wireless client -&gt; internet on lan port.</p><p>Originally I set the static ip address of the router to be 192.168.2.1, and the wlan address 192.168.1.220.</p><p>I somehow switched the protocol on LAN from static to DHCP - from there on I am not able to access the router.</p><br /><p>What I did: I hold the reset button before powering up, the router does enter a &quot;blinking sys led&quot; state, led lighting up roughly 2 times per second. I can ping 192.168.1.1 and see response - but an nmap scan indicates all ports are being filtered (dropped). Therefore I was not able to access the router through telnet/ssh.</p><p>What I also did: Shortly after powering up, I press the reset button -&gt; normal bootup with rapidly blinking sys led but eventually turns solid together with wireless led.</p><p>If you have experience in entering failsafe mode on this device, let me know! Thank you.</p>									</div>
