					<p>I&#039;m trying to upgrade from WR 0.9 to Kamikaze 7.09, but when TFTP&#039;ing Kamikaze to the router, after the DIAG light goes out, the router&#039;s &quot;G&quot; light goes off and just the power light is lit. As a result, I can&#039;t access the router at all or connect to the internet. I&#039;ve also tried upgrading using the OpenWRT firmware upgrade page to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I&#039;m about to buy a new router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Kamikaze 7.09 runs fine on my WHR-HP-G54, though I compiled my own. You might try an older release just in case there&#039;s some incompatibility with 7.09. Are you sure you&#039;re using the right flavor, i.e. the trx file? Have you tried reinstalling WR? If you can get that running again, try updating to Kamikaze using the command line. It&#039;s a lot more straightforward than trying to TFTP the image to the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I did try an older release to no avail. I did not try the command line. I&#039;ll try that tomorrow and report back, thanks for the suggestion.</p>									</div>
