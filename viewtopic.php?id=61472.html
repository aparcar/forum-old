					<p>No clue yet. 1-2 years ago there was some package (clearsilver???) with illegal characters in the maintainer&#039;s name.

Illegal chars or punctuation somewhere causing a token to be read wrong. Likely a dependency or something like that. </p><p>It might also be an error or bug in some of the toolchain tools. Something that pops up just with your buildhost and target architecture?</p><p>You might try to search for the culprit by starting with a really minimal build without additional packages and then adding packages one by one in order to find the one adding the error.
