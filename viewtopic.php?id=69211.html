					<p>Dear friends, I have this router TP-Link TD-W8980: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8980">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8980</a> and just soldered the J7 serial connector to connect a serial cable. I have only connected 3 Pins (from top to bottom) VCC (3.3V), GND, Rx on speed 115200 8N1. However when I try to press t on the console to interrupt U-Boot autobooting nothing happens, also I see a lot of gibberish language and not clear readable text. Does someone know a solution for this please? </p><p>Here you can see images below to see what I mean:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://s29.postimg.org/pq3ix9wef/image.jpg" alt="https://s29.postimg.org/pq3ix9wef/image.jpg" /></span> </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://s28.postimg.org/irj3tw89p/image.jpg" alt="https://s28.postimg.org/irj3tw89p/image.jpg" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://s27.postimg.org/553tlno7l/image.jpg" alt="https://s27.postimg.org/553tlno7l/image.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Put the jumper on your adapter to 3.3 volts not 5.&nbsp; Do not connect the 3.3 volt pin on the router.</p><p>Try 57600 baud.&nbsp; In very rare cases it may be even slower than that.</p><p>You need a TXD wire hooked up to send anything to the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Alright. Thanks for your response. So I only need connect 3 separate pins, so TXD for transmitting and RXD for receiving, and GND. So VCC 3.5V is not needed at all?</p>									</div>

					<p>Also the wiki <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8980">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/td-w8980</a> shows 2 different pictures from the serial connector, this is the right one at <span class="postimg"><img src="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/tplink/td-w8980/td-w8980-v1_front.jpg" alt="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/tplink/td-w8980/td-w8980-v1_front.jpg" /></span>, this one is older model and the serial connector positions looks different <span class="postimg"><img src="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/tplink/td-w8970/td-w8970_serial-jtag.jpg" alt="https://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/tplink/td-w8970/td-w8970_serial-jtag.jpg" /></span></p><p>The wiki says Pins (from top to bottom) VCC (3.3V), GND, Rx, Tx , so which one is from top to bottom? Is the first picture correct from top to bottom? I don&#039;t want to fry the motherboard. Just starting to learn from this to flash OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>st4r</strong> on 4 Jan 2017, 17:46)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the tips! I don&#039;t have a multimeter yet, however when I connect accordingly only GND, Rx, Tx I get no output on the screen anymore. Could it be that the serial port got destroyed or that the USB adapter is defect now? Above post I was still getting some gibberish output. I think I connected accidentally VCC from usb adapter to Tx on the mobo, because the wiki says Pins (from top to bottom) VCC (3.3V), GND, Rx, Tx, but the wiki says it wrong in reversal order for this model.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>st4r</strong> on 4 Jan 2017, 19:20)</p>

					<p>The advice you&#039;ve got is correct you only need to connect RX, TX and GND. Usually the presence of strange characters means issues with the ground (remember you can get ground almost anywhere e.g. metal casing of USB ports or antenna so no need to soldier it). Without trying a different USB adapter it is hard to say whether you might have burned something on the board or the USB adapter. <br />The problem is you have connected 3.3V on the board to VCC on the USB adapter (which is 5V since the USB power coming from the computer is 5V) So you could have burned things on the board as it was powered 5V instead of the normal 3.3V.</p>									</div>
