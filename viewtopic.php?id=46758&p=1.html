					<p>as far as I can see, the nand controller is too broadcom, so I assume they don&#039;t publish the source drivers, right?</p><p>Northstar brcmnand NAND Flash Controller driver, Version 0.1 (c) Broadcom Inc. 2012</p><p>I also understood the router comes with a customized openwrt. can&#039;t we just take the binary modules from one and use them?</p><p>sorry if I ask stupid question, I&#039;m not really familiar with the dev stuff, but have some linux experience. I imagine there could be incompatibilities between the C libraries used for the modules and the ones openwrt use.</p><p>just my thoughts..., shortly I will get my own R6300v2, so if I can anyhow move forward the dev for this router, more than happy to do it. in like two weeks I will be able to experiments.</p>									</div>

					<p>Binary modules cannot be just taken, usually devices come with old versions of openwrt, based on some old kernel... and binary modules are suitable for kernel that they were built for and that&#039;s it...<br />Also there might be licensing issues with that.. Basically this is not possible.</p>									</div>
