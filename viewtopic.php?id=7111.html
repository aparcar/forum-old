					<p>Hello,</p><p>I use an ASUS WL-500g Deluxe with OpenWRT RC5. Currently, I have set up printer sharing using p910nd as described in the HowTo (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/PrinterSharingHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/PrinterSharingHowto</a>). The printer is a cheap EPSON Stylus Color C44UX. The protocol used for printing from my Windows XP clients is RAW.<br />Before I switched to OpenWRT I used printer sharing on the original ASUS firmware (protocol LPR).</p><p>I have the impression that the prints have looked better using the ASUS firmware. Now it does not look as smooth as before. My first thought was that this may be caused by the different protocol. Am I wrong?</p><p>Now I am looking for a different print server. I have read about CUPS and LPRng. But there are still some open questions.<br />CUPS requires space for spooling the print jobs (should be no problem, since OpenWRT runs on a 1 GB USB stick on my system), and somehow one cannot print a testpage from the local CUPS due to missing ghostscript software.</p><p>Does CUPS support PostScript printers only?<br />Is LPRng ported to OpenWRT already?</p><p>Which printing server is most recommended?<br />Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p><p>slowjoe</p>									</div>

					<p>1. AFAIK only current build are supported and this thread is for white russian only<br />2. what CUPS does or does not support, is not our concern. Please clarify this in the CUPS forum<br />3. whether OpenWrt supports CUPS, yes it does:</p><p>Package: cups<br />Version: 1.4.4-1<br />Depends: zlib, libpthread, libpng, libjpeg, libstdcpp<br />Provides:<br />Status: unknown ok not-installed<br />Section: net<br />Architecture: ar71xx<br />Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team &lt;openwrt-devel@openwrt.org&gt;<br />MD5Sum: b62e70b77377cd78d64eb13d13afac33<br />Size: 2.189.195<br />Filename: cups_1.4.4-1_ar71xx.ipk<br />Source: feeds/packages/net/cups<br />Description: A printer spooling system for devices with USB or LP support.</p><p>As you can see, you need 2MiB for CUPS package, then storage space for dependencies. Then RAM/SWAP for the spooling. A howto for installing and configuring a CUPS server would only cover the current build (Backfire) or trunk. It is incomplete:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cups.server">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cups.server</a></p><p>Do you want to complete this howto?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you could tell me how I can solve this: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28819">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=28819</a><br />More than a week I&#039;m reading forums and asking everyone, no one knows about it.<br />I thought lprng would be the solution, since it is used in original firmware from ASUS (3.0.4.4) (WL500gPv2) and it&#039;s working with &quot;bit count&quot; option enabled.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dumghen</strong> on 2 Mar 2011, 11:37)</p>
