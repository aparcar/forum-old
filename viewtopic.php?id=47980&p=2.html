					<p>Ubiquiti devices all the way [1] [2]. They&#039;re the hacker&#039;s choice!<br />Before I discovered Ubiquiti, the Linksys WRT54Gx series was my goto. The problem with them is that, as a given WRT54Gx line matures, they usually shave down the specs. You can see that in action with the WRT54GS series here [3], which debuted with 8MB of flash and now only sports 2MB. Good luck getting anything useful into 2MB.<br />The other problem with the WRT54Gx&#039;s is that there&#039;s quite a lot of hardware and architecture variation under the hood. You&#039;re usually fine, but I do have one WRT54G-RG at home here that wouldn&#039;t even take OpenWRT. It&#039;s running DD-WRT, which is a ghetto. (I see some other commenters here feel similarly).<br />Anyway the Ubiquiti PicoStation 2HP, by contrast, has<br />&nbsp; - 8MB of flash<br />&nbsp; - 32MB of RAM<br />&nbsp; - a nice Atheros SoC which transmits at the legal max of 1000 mW<br />&nbsp; - can easily be outfitted with high gain external antennas<br />&nbsp; - works perfectly under OpenWRT, and<br />&nbsp; - is competitively priced at $78 [4]<br /><a href="http://teambuildingactivitiesmelbourne.webnode.com/news/wherever-you-are-team-building-melbourne-will-work-effectively/">http://teambuildingactivitiesmelbourne. â€¦ fectively/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johnbaker</strong> on 3 Jul 2014, 03:05)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>We have been working hard lately and are now in the stage of allmost finished development board. We have made the hardware and have done a lot of work on the software. The board is fully controlled by a webserver written in C, not spawning any new processes for performance. </p><p>It works via a REST api and an HTML5 frontent. We are now finishing our work and perfecting the software. To achieve this we have set up a crowdfunding campaign:</p><p><a href="http://igg.me/at/dptboard/x/8121818">http://igg.me/at/dptboard/x/8121818</a></p><p>You can of course help us by backing, if you don&#039;t want to back share it on your social media. It would be of great help to us and the more feedback we get the better we can make the software. </p><p>Kind regards,<br />Daan</p>									</div>
