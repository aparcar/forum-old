					<p>First of all, I work in IT so I know basics about routers and stuff. So please don&#039;t ask me if I adresses are correct. If someone is using OpenWRT he should know something about routers and how to manage them...</p><p>I&#039;ve flashed latest version of OpenWRT, like from 2 weeks ago, everything working perfect. I wanted to act my router like WIFI repeater, so I turned off wifi AP and turned on WIFI Client to connect to my main router at home, it didn&#039;t worked - I had some settings wrong, but that&#039;s not important. I turned off WIFI, cause it didn&#039;t worked and go to LAN settings,where I accidentaly turned off LAN support (I was thinking I&#039;m in WLAN settings :-)&nbsp; )so I couldn&#039;t connect to router through cable or wifi. So I tried EMERGENCY FLASH - turned OFF router and keep pressing RESET button and turn ON router for 15 seconds. Power led started to blink like it should, maybe it already reseted all setings, maybe not but it was blinking like it was executing regular boot to emergency mode. <br />So there are 2 options what could happen:<br />1. EMERGENCY MODE is not working (not possible) anymore after OpenWRT is flashed.<br />2. LAN is still turned off after EMERGENCY reset.</p><p>When I manually set PC ip to 192.168.1.10 and Gateway to 192.168.1.1 it shows in windows network properties that I&#039;m connected to &quot;western digital&quot;. But can&#039;t access anything on 192.168.1.1 address is not available.</p><p>Can I connect to router through WAN port? Anyone tried to go to EMERGENCY mode from OpenWRT? Any ideas?</p><p>Thank you</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dreak</strong> on 12 Jan 2015, 22:53)</p>

					<p>I see in the other thread that your problem has at least been partially resolved, but:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>dreak wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>1. EMERGENCY MODE is not working (not possible) anymore after OpenWRT is flashed.</p></blockquote></div><p>Please stop repeating that, it is simply not true. Flashing <em>any</em> firmware -- whether it is WD&#039;s own, OpenWrt, or a broken one -- does <em>not</em> touch the area where the bootloader sits. This bootloader is booting the firmware, and it is also providing the Emergency Recovery mode. If you wanted to overwrite the bootloader you&#039;d have to consciously go through a lengthy process including a custom-built firmware -- OpenWrt itself doesn&#039;t even <em>allow</em> overwriting the bootloader area, for exactly that reason.</p><p>And, to state the obvious, your bootloader <em>must</em> be fine. Because, well, your router still boots.</p><p>I strongly suspect that you are still doing something wrong with accessing the Emergency Flash. Some minute detail, maybe something as trivial as the wrong port on the router (I actually don&#039;t remember if it cares about whether you&#039;re connected to WAN or LAN, I believe it should be a LAN port) or something with your browser&#039;s cache (maybe it cached OpenWrt&#039;s redirect on 192.168.1.1) or its network settings.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>2. LAN is still turned off after EMERGENCY reset. (...) Power led started to blink like it should, maybe it already reseted all setings</p></blockquote></div><p>The Emergency Recovery procedure mode does not reset anything. It actually has no concept of how the firmware itself works and cannot make any adjustments to its configuration. The only thing it cand o is flash a new firmware, effectively ironing it over a part of the flash memory.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Anyone tried to go to EMERGENCY mode from OpenWRT?</p></blockquote></div><p>Several times, yes.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 13 Jan 2015, 07:43)</p>
