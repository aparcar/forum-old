					<p>I really don&#039;t remember if it was c2600 or c7 that I went back to original firmware just to check both radios, but after that I returned to openwrt.<br />There should be no problem returning. If something goes terribly wrong you still can use the serial console but you would need some soldering and break warranty.<br />You have plenty of space for most packages in this router and also more CPU for heavy vpn traffic . With 8MB routers I didn&#039;t use extroot but placed the extra bigger packages and&nbsp; libraries like Nmap in the USB. <br />That and openfortivpn (just an open sslvpn client for Fortinet firewalls) made me build my own firmware. <br />Now I need to try strongswan to use a site to site ipsec vpn. <br />Good luck, and don&#039;t panic</p>									</div>

					<p>One thing I miss a bit is the LEDs in the C2600. They are less visible than in other routers and don&#039;t work in openwrt.

					<p>Quickly sharing my personal experience so far: got my C2600 v1.1 a few days ago, and I could install the latest snapshots very easily through the stock firmware&#039;s update interface. (In fact, that&#039;s the only thing I used the original firmware for <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />.)</p><p>Running a permanent (outgoing) OpenVPN connection on the router through which all my internet traffic is routed, and it is just great. There&#039;s an option, a guide, a package or documentation for about anything I could think of doing on the router (setting up file servers, encrypting disks, ...). And the performance is awesome (especially compared to the cheap type of modem-router-wifi-switch provided by my ISP...).</p><p>We&#039;ll see how stable it is over time, but I&#039;m very happy about everything so far.</p><p>(Also, using the April snapshot, if anyone is interested.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Since you are getting half of the link speed, it seems like the newer phone just has a worse AC radio in it. For my current phone, the Axon 7, even though they have the same chip in it, the US model is limited to 433 while the international model gets the full 866. Based on your language, I&#039;m guessing not in the US, so for the Exynos chipset models, they may have limited it for some reason.</p><p>So, unfortunately, it happens.

					<p>Do you really want noscan on there though? According to the openWRT wireless config wiki, turning that option on violated regulatory agencies.
