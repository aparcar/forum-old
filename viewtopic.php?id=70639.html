					<p>I want to install openwrt on my Netgear WNR1000v3. This is my first time installing openwrt, so I am still a bit confused. <br />In the official documentation, I found pieces of informations that seem to contradict each other:</p><p>- The device page&nbsp; has a ? as supported openwrt version<br />- The table of hardware says that the DD trunk is supported<br />- Somebody on the mailing list tried to install it and it didn&#039;t work<br />- ddwrt lists it as known incompatible device, saying that nvram size is incompatible</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the pointer. I searched for change sets containing WNR1000v3 and found two more conversations where people tried to get it working. Both times they did not follow up with the end result or gave up.</p>									</div>
