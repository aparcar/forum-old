					<p>Hi guys</p><p>I really need help, since I&#039;ve been reading wiki and this forum but I can&#039;t make my TP Link 1043 to work again</p><br /><p>so the story in oder :</p><p>1. I look at open wrt and I think this is very cool, so I upgrade my TPLink wr1043nd to openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin using &quot;Firmware Upgrade&quot; from the orginal firmware. <br />2. After reboot it wont run, I can&#039;t telnet /ping , so I tried using failsafe mode (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a>)<br />3. It worked and i can ping/telnet 192.168.1.1</p><p> since I was noob I don&#039;t know what to do, but nevertheless I tried belows telnet command (in order):</p><p>4. mount_root<br />5. passwd -&gt; successfully changed the original root password<br />5. firstboot<br />6. mtd -r erase rootfs_data</p><p>reboot the router, but I still not able to ping/telnet the 192.168.1.1<br />so I tried random solution (again I&#039;m very very noob at this)</p><p>7. mtd -r write openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr1043nd-v1-squashfs-factory.bin firmware<br />but the telnet said : couldn&#039;t open image file</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />what should I do?<br />should I mount the firmware again? if yes, how could I do that?<br /> I&#039;m really confused and been trying to fix this more than 5 hour by my self</p><p>thanks in advance,</p>									</div>

					<p>Without a serial you cannot see what is wrong.</p><p>Perhaps you could boot failsafe and with telnet you can create a working /etc/config/wireless using vi and reboot to normal boot and see if wireless works?</p><p>Here is the basic WR1043ND wireless config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device  radio0

					<p>You should read up on how to use vi. It is an editor built into OpenWRT. To edit /etc/config/wireless you would boot to failsafe and do:</p><p>telnet 192.168.1.1</p><p>vi /etc/config/wireless</p><p>To edit with vi you press &#039;i&#039; and then type whatever you want and to exit edit mode you press &#039;Esc&#039;.</p><p>To exit vi and save you first exit edit mode with &#039;Esc&#039; and then you do &#039;:&#039; to enter command mode and type &#039;wq&#039; and to abandon changes and quit you do &#039;:&#039; and then &#039;q!&#039;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi orca</p><p>No, my problem is not invented<br />You see, I&#039;m genuinely stupid at linux. The first linux for me is puppy linux, and i don&#039;t know how to use &quot;sudo&quot; until now.</p><p>So I&#039;ll try to explain again. I can flash my router, but after that I was shock that wlan dont run. After some reading, i know that was normal. So i tried to connect using wan cable. Then assuming it already has luci, I just run web interface, it wont run and confused again. And after some more reading, i know that&#039;s normal again.</p><p>So i try to ping my router, but no reply. Reading failsafe mode and trying for some hours, until I really get what was that. Finally i can use it. But i was very confused what to do after i get failsafe to run. So i come here.</p><br /><p>Thanks for the idea, i&#039;ll try to install luci, after i got home. The truth is that i dont undertand. Shouldn&#039;t I download luci, then install it? Or it already included in original firmware flash?</p><p>Thx to all for helping me, i sry but i dont even understand half of what you all said. But i&#039;ll be fast learner. Snce i really want my router to come back life</p><br /><p>Ps : my problem is that i try something beyond my capabilities</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blasev</strong> on 23 Apr 2012, 02:22)</p>
