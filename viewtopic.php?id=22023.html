					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a WGT634U unit running OpenWRT 8.09 and are having issues getting my external USB harddisks (two SATA disks in &quot;Powerfreakz ripple&quot; SATA-to-USB enclosures) to work. I&#039;ve tried connecting them to a Linux machine and an Apple MacBook and they work fine on those (so the hardware isn&#039;t broken). <br />However, when connecting them either directly (well, one at a time as it only has one USB port) or through a USB hub they only blink their activity LED whilst I can hear them trying to spin up and then giving up in cycles of maybe half a second. logread and dmesg doesn&#039;t show any notice at all about anything connecting on the USB port. Connecting a USB memory stick works fine, it gets detected and gets mounted with no problems.</p><p>Thinking that it might be a power issue I got a powered USB hub, but it doesn&#039;t seem to have changed anything. The USB memory stick works fine in the hub, but the disks still do their attempts to spin up. I tried removing the ehci_hcd module, in case it was some issue with the high-speed mode, but that didn&#039;t help either.</p><p>Any ideas of how to move forward from here? Could it be that the powered USB hub also doesn&#039;t deliver enough power? When the disks are connected to my Linux machine lsusb shows them asking for 2mA of power which I have a vague memory of is the maximum they are allowed to ask for.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know how to measure it, and I&#039;m sure there are more experienced hands about than I, but I&#039;m going to bet that you got a cheap powered hub, and that it doesn&#039;t deliver enough voltage to drive the platter motor on your drive.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I was afraid of that, but it seems like even if you are building a cheap hub, as you are getting the voltage from the mains it would be _more_ problems driving the voltage below required levels than not to. I&#039;d imagined the quality difference would be in getting the power stable or something.<br />I&#039;ll see what I can dig up on the power end of things, but except that any other places where things might go wrong where I should be looking?</p>									</div>

					<p>uhm, <br />I wished I read this thread before buying a WD my passport elite drive for my WGT634U<br />it seems as if the drive is power-starving, click, click, clicky<br />anyways to power-mod the router usb port?</p>									</div>
