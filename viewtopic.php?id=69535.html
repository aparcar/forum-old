					<p>A week ago I used this<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan#configuration_by_shell_script"><strong>Configuration by shell script</strong></a> script to create a guest wifi, ip to the wshaper part, on a TP Link WRD3500 with OpenWrt 15.05, back then this router was the main [PPPoE](192.168.0.1), now I added a new router (to expand wifi signal) [TP Link WR1043ND] as PPPoE 192.168.0.1 and moved the 3500 to static ip 192.168.0.2 and the guest wifi on the 3500 does not work any more.</p><p>Router 1: TP Link WR1043ND: PPPoE: 192.168.0.1<br />Router2 : TP Link WRD3500: Static ip: 192.168.0.2</p><p>When I connect to the guest.Invitados wifi does is not internet access, when the router 3500 was the main guest.invitados was working fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xkiz</strong> on 24 Jan 2017, 17:22)</p>

					<p>The router that is connected to the modem should establish the main and guest networks.&nbsp; To expand Wi-Fi coverage, the networks can be extended to another router running as a &quot;dumb AP&quot; by using VLANs on the Ethernet cable.</p>									</div>

					<p>Guest wifi is not only creating a new SSID. In addition to that, you need to set up routes and firewall settings.</p><p>Usually you have something like this:<br />* Through WAN (routing, not access) has masqueraded output<br />* From LAN allows everything<br />* From Guest to WAN (access, not routing) is allowed for DHCP and DNS.</p><p>This basically means: Your primary Guest network setting needs to be done on the router that provides WAN since there needs to be a firewall setting for that. Of course there are ways around that, but those are rather complicated settings and I refuse to explain those.</p><p>A very important thing to mention: Spanning a wifi SSID is not necessarily bound to the device providing DHCP, DNS, firewall and gateway for that network. Spanning a wifi SSID can be done on a completely different device.</p><p>A suggestion for a huge network to walk around and get hand overed if necessary:</p><p>* Create two LANs on the primary router. One for you, one for your neightbour. Or as many as there are neighbours to be included. Everyone gets its own network. You can basically set them up as distinct guest networks.<br />* Us a vlan &quot;tagged&quot; cable to connect your routers, and put tags for every vlan on it you have, except the WAN uplink.<br />* Configure the very same wifi SSIDs on every of your router.<br />* SSID does not mean frequency. Use different frequencies on different routes.<br />* Bind one SSID on one vlan, and make sure to have that configuration in place on every router in the same way.<br />* Keep in mind to set up DHCP, DNS and routing only on the very first router, the one with your WAN connection.<br />That&#039;s basically a &quot;dumb AP&quot; setting with multiple networks.</p><p>Drawback of this thing: Every router gets physical access to all networks of every of your neighbours, which might be a security issue.<br />Benefit: You can be at home or at your neighbours house and have your computer or smart phone connected to your personal network but to the router physically next to you. Kind of roaming.</p><p>Another version, which would make your networks more independent:</p><p>* Router 1 provides regular LAN and GUEST networks, but the GUEST is provided not as wifi but only through a distinct wired port.<br />* Router 2 uses its WAN port to be connected to the GUEST port of Router 1</p><p>This creates you three different networks:<br />* Router 1 LAN<br />* Router 1 GUEST being Router 2 WAN<br />* Router 2 LAN</p><p>Make sure to have three different IP ranges.</p><p>Benefit: Even physical access to router 2 does not mean network access to LAN of router 1.<br />Drawback: You cannot simply move around and hand over from one router to another. </p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the info, but I thing I&#039;ll move &quot;Invitados&quot; from Guest to LAN, that is easier, and we just need secondary wifi which we could Turn On/Off and avoid unwanted people from using our wifi when they are not on our houses...</p><p>I have to unbrick a tplink wr2543nd, if I successed I&#039;ll flash it and put openwrt 15.05 on it , put it as main and try to do the guest from there, which that worked when the 3500 was the main router.</p>									</div>
