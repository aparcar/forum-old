					<p>I have the listed wireless device. Running Firmware: DD-WRT v24-sp2. I wan&#039;t to add a better antenna&#039;s to it. Or at least provide access to the RF output on it. The unit is working rather well except for the poor range due to the bad antenna&#039;s. Has anyone done such a thing on this puppy. Could even a add a 5w booster to it which I have laying around doing nothing. Any info appreciated. Have done such things before but not to this beast. If I could get into it, I am sure I could do what I want. <br />Thanks all.</p>									</div>
