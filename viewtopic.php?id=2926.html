					<p>You don&#039;t want to start the tftp until after you are able to ping the router (right after power up).

					<p>OK, finally fixed.&nbsp; It was a firewall problem on the machine from which I was running the tftp.&nbsp; In case anyone else suffers from this, here is what I believe will thoroughly disable any firewall blocking:</p><p>iptables -F<br />iptables -X<br />iptables -P INPUT ALLOW<br />iptables -P OUTPUT ALLOW</p><p>Note, though, that your firewall may get re-enabled each time you ifup an interface.&nbsp; I suggest checking with iptables -L before you try the tftp.&nbsp; I now have a functional OpenWRT&#039;d WRT54g.</p><p>A couple of other random hints:<br />* when editing files in /etc, check the permissions.<br />* dnsmasq doesn&#039;t seem to like comments at end of line, e.g. appending hostnames as comments in /etc/ethers.</p><p>Many thanks to everyone who has helped to make this work.</p><p>--Phil.</p>									</div>
