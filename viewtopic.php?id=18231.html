					<p>I&#039;ve created my own LuCI theme, following the instructions at <a href="http://luci.freifunk-halle.net/Documentation/ThemesHowTo">http://luci.freifunk-halle.net/Document â€¦ hemesHowTo</a></p><p>The problem is that the theme does not get installed. It does not show up under the LuCI section in make menuconfig. Actually, there&#039;s a good deal of themes in the /themes directory of the LuCI trunk snapshot that don&#039;t show up in make menuconfig.</p><br /><p>What am I doing wrong here?</p><br /><br /><p>edit: I wasn&#039;t defining the package in /luci/contrib/package/luci/Makefile</p><br /><p>Sorry guys. I should have read the documentation better.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 29 Dec 2008, 23:32)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m also interested in compiling and distributing my own theme.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone through the steps outlined in the link above and made the necessary changes to the Makefile (however my Makefile was located in the openwrt trunk directory &lt;my openwrt dir&gt;/tmp/dl/luci-0.8.8/contrib/package/luci/Makefile).&nbsp; When I run the makefile it creates the proper files and folders in the mytheme/dist folder.&nbsp; However, I can&#039;t get the theme to show up in the make menuconfig so that it will be included in my build.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even updated the &lt;my openwrt dir&gt;/feeds/luci.index with mytheme information and it still doesn&#039;t show up.&nbsp; I&#039;d appreciate any advice, thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>smith32</strong> on 9 Nov 2009, 21:12)</p>
