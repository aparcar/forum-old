					<p>Hey. I got a router from my father, and it&#039;s set up with OpenWrt, he&#039;s pretty good with this stuff and i believe it should be really well set up. I don&#039;t know too much about this, but a person i know did a little port scan for me, and these were the results.</p><p>PORT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STATE&nbsp; &nbsp; SERVICE<br />7/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;filtered echo<br />9/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;filtered discard<br />37/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; filtered time<br />79/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp; filtered finger<br />389/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered ldap<br />427/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered svrloc<br />513/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered login<br />543/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered klogin<br />544/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered kshell<br />548/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered afp<br />631/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered ipp<br />873/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered rsync<br />4899/tcp&nbsp; filtered radmin<br />5000/tcp&nbsp; filtered upnp<br />5060/tcp&nbsp; filtered sip<br />6000/tcp&nbsp; filtered X11<br />8009/tcp&nbsp; filtered ajp13<br />8081/tcp&nbsp; filtered blackice-icecap<br />9100/tcp&nbsp; filtered jetdirect<br />49152/tcp filtered unknown<br />49154/tcp filtered unknown</p><br /><p>I don&#039;t know too much about these, but &quot;4899/tcp&nbsp; filtered radmin&quot; got me a little worried, and i don&#039;t recognize any of the other stuff either really, so i&#039;m asking if these are basicly something that could be potentially dangerous for me or my stuff. And if something is dangerous, how should i deal with it? I did the ShieldsUP! test though, and got good results &quot;THE EQUIPMENT AT THE TARGET IP ADDRESS<br />DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR UPnP PROBES!&quot;.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fiaskoko</strong> on 26 Jan 2017, 07:00)</p>
