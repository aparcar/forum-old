					<p>Hi, I&#039;m using an WRT55AGv2 board (which is very similar to SparkLAN WX-7800A / Tonze AW-6660 according to pics), based in the AR5312A Atheros SoC.</p><p>I am using a serial cable to intercept the bootloader (which is not redboot, its some wxWorks one) and tell it to load the .elf image using tftp. It works nicely, but the problem is that it crashes.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...

					<p>I have a working image that I use on WX-7800A devices.</p><p>The image is a simple image built for Atheros boards.</p><p>However, I had to enable redboot first on the board, and I did it with installing DD-WRT. After DD-WRT was up and running, I needed a serial console to get into redboot, so I could load the OpenWrt images.</p><p>I did this on 8 devices in the past, all of them have been running OpenWrt since. However, even after setting up Redboot to be accessible with telnet, only 2 devices can do that. The redboot on the others is still only accessible with serial.</p><p>But you only need serial for the first time install, sysupgrade works afterwards (just make sure to have as much free ram as possible before upgrading).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>duvi</strong> on 11 Nov 2012, 11:53)</p>

					<p>Thanks. I&#039;m trying to debug the kernel, its not founding the board data, which I&#039;m asuming is the same used in vxworks...</p><p>Also, do you happen to have a redboot for AR531x compiled with this options? &quot;DRAM_MB=16 FLASH_MB=4 CLK_MHZ=220 PHY=kendin ap30&quot; ?

					<p>I don&#039;t have a redboot compiled. I only used the redboot which was included in the dd-wrt image.</p><p>Before you flash any image, check if your board has 2 or 4 MB ram, and flash only 4 MB ones. Flashing on a 2 MB device will brick it!</p>									</div>

					<p>Good News! <br />I&#039;ve modified the kernel a bit so it searches in the whole flash for the board config/radio config... And it seems to work <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> So I&#039;m guessing that VXworks keeps it in a lower address... Now I&#039;m trying to dump the flash (within the linux kernel) so I can keep a safe backup without having to make a JTAG probe.</p><p>For future references, this is the address of board data:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>find_board_config: flash_limit: be800000
find_board_config: found at be7c0000 :)
Radio config found at offset 0x20000(0x100)</code></pre></div><p>So vxWorks stores the board data in flash_limit-0x40000 (256kb before the end of flash) and the radio data in flash_limit-0x20000 (128kb before the end of flash)</p><p>The change I did is in build_dir/linux_atheros/linux-2.6.30.10/arch/mips/ar231x/board.c, inside of find_board_config<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>addr &gt;= flash_limit - 0x30000;
gets changed to
addr &gt;= flash_limit - 0x400000;</code></pre></div><p>Cheers,<br />Gzaloprgm</p>									</div>
