					<p>Hi,<br />apologies if some questions are of strong noob quality, I&#039;m not that familiar with OpenWRT, but certainly willing to get my hands dirty. Here is what I want to achieve:<br />1. Guests should have internet connectivity but no access to my internal network, all needed services (like DNS) should come from external service providers (e.g. OpenDNS)<br />2. The router should essentially act as an AP to my internal network for internal clients, all services (DNS, DHCP) are supported by internal servers, not by the router itself.</p><p>I was able to setup a second WLAN on the router, but I&#039;m struggling with getting basic connectivity going, so here are my questions:</p><p>a. How can I add a dedicated DHCP pool to the guest WLAN? Do I need to create a logical network like the default &quot;lan&quot; and &quot;wan&quot; networks and add dhcp. config statements like </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcp.guestâ€¦</code></pre></div><p> Which interface would I need to specify for it? </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcp.guest.interface=?</code></pre></div><p>b. What would I specify as the gateway interface for the guest WLAN, is it the router&#039;s LAN facing interface or is it the upstream gateway?<br />c. Can I use a different security setting for the guest WLAN (e.g. WPA2 Enterprise) than for the internal net (e.g WPA2-Personal)?</p><p>Thanks<br />Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>The solution depends on how your network is set up. You say your router is acting just as an AP - but don&#039;t mention what device is doing the actual NAT/routing. Without going into VLAN trunking, etc. the only way to set this up on this router is if this router is also doing the routing, i.e. not an AP.</p><p>Anyway, in response to your questions:<br />a) In order to segregate the guest network from your local network in any way, yes, you do need to create a &quot;logical network&quot; for it. This is all very straightforward using the GUI. As for setting up the DHCP range, again if you use the LUCI GUI it&#039;s pretty much automatic.</p><p>b) You would have to specify this router&#039;s IP on the guest subnet to be the gateway for DHCP requests on that subnet.</p><p>c) Yes.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. Looks like a will get my hands dirty :-)<br />For the records: The actual Internet facing (NAT, routing) and internal network infra (DNS/DHCP) serving part is handled by an Ubiquity EdgeRouter Lite with stock firmware (v1.4.1). Downstream of that box is the TP-Link + a few hosts (all via an HP switch) that provide services (NAS, mail etc.). The TP-Link is then used for couch surfing and the guest services. As an overview:<br />Internet =&gt; ERL =&gt; HP Switch =&gt; TP-Link (+ internal hosts) =&gt; guest services, couch tablets</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, yes. Given that your TP-Link isn&#039;t the &quot;network controller&quot; or external gateway, it&#039;s harder to create a guest network segregated from the main network. Simply because, the TP-Link only has access to the main network.</p><p>The &quot;enterprise&quot; way of doing it would be VLAN trunking, though that depends on every piece of equipment along the way supporting 802.1q or at least transparent passthrough.</p><p>I think another way to do it would be to create a routed, but non-NAT&#039;d network on the TP-Link, and set specific firewall rules to block access to anywhere else in your LAN. Though you could use NAT as well, it makes little difference here.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply and sorry for coming back late. I&#039;m trying to wrap my head around the VLAN design. While I think I understand how to create a VLAN on physical ports, I&#039;m stuck on how to get the Guest WLAN coerced into a VLAN. Would I need to create a bridge between a physical port (e.g. port 1) and the guest WLAN and add the physical port (port 1 in this case) to a VLAN with tagging enabled for the VLAN on the WAN uplink?</p><p>I&#039;m trying the VLAN part to have the option to repeat this design on multiple routers so that I have a cohesive Guest WLAN with a single subnet instead of having multiple subnets for the Guest WLAN on multiple routers. Multiple routers might be needed to have coverage in the house and on the patio.</p>									</div>

					<p>On Openwrt, VLANs are exposed as subinterfaces. So if the physical port was eth0, then you added VLAN1, that would appear as eth0.1, VLAN2 as eth0.2, etc. </p><p>Then you would in Openwrt bridge the guest WLAN to the VLAN-specific interface - e.g. eth0.2 while bridging your &quot;normal&quot; wireless network to a different VLAN, or none at all, e.g. eth0.1 or eth0.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry to revive the old thread, but since the topic is still valid, I hope it&#039;s ok. I&#039;ve now created the GuestWLAN and a corresponding VLAN. However, I lost connectivity to the rest of my LAN (cannot ping the router from the LAN nor any host on the LAN from the router, pinging the LAN IP of the router from the router works, however). I had the firewall disabled, just to make sure, there is no interference from there. Here is the relevant part of my config<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;
     option ifname &#039;eth1&#039;
     option type &#039;bridge&#039;
     option proto &#039;static&#039;
     option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.4&#039;
     option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
     option gateway &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;

config interface &#039;GuestWLAN&#039;
     option ifname &#039;eth1.5&#039;
     option type &#039;bridge&#039;

     option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
     option gateway &#039;192.168.2.1&#039;

config switch_vlan
     option name &#039;switch0&#039;
     option reset &#039;1&#039;
     option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;

# normal LAN 
# should not be tagged to coexist with my other LAN devices
# phys port 1 (= switch port 4) as uplink
config switch_vlan
      option device &#039;switch0&#039;
      option vlan &#039;1&#039;
      option ports &#039;0t 1 2 3 4&#039;  #  Note: switch port 4 is not tagged

# Guest WLAN vlan (phys port 1 as uplink)
config switch_vlan
      option device &#039;switch0&#039;
      option vlan &#039;5&#039;
      option ports &#039;0t 4t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I made some observations that make me wonder if my switch is correctly configured. Checking output of swconfig, switch port 4 (the uplink) shows </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>pvid: 1</code></pre></div><p>. I would have assumed the line would show 1 and 5. Furthermore, the VLAN summary of swconfig shows<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>VLAN 1:
     vid: 1
     ports: 0t 1 2 3 4t  # &lt;== surprise

VLAN5:
    vid: 5
    ports: 0t 4t</code></pre></div><p>Now a couple of questions:<br />1. Why is switch port 4 listed as tagged for VLAN 1 when it&#039;s config doesn&#039;t specify it?<br />2. I want my &quot;normal&quot; LAN untagged, so that I don&#039;t have to mess with the rest of my hosts. Is VLAN id 1 the right setting on this router? If not, which VLAN id would I need to use?<br />3. Am I looking at the right parts in the configuration or am I completely wrong? Where would I need to look?</p><p>Thanks<br />Marcus</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />continuing on this journey. I have patched OpenWRT trunk with the changes from <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/40777">#40777</a> and it compiled just fine. It also seems to support untagged and tagged VLANs on the same port, judging from the output of<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># swconfig dev switch0 vlan 1 show
VLAN 1:
    vid: 1
    ports: 0t 1 2 3 4

# swconfig dev switch0 vlan 5 show
VLAN 5:
    vid: 5
    ports: 0t 4t</code></pre></div><p>Switch port 4 (=phys port 1) is the uplink to the remainder of my network. However, I&#039;m still not able to ping the uplink router from my TL-WR1043ND v2, nor am I able to get a reply pinging the TL-WR1043NDv2 from my uplink router. Pinging the TL-WR1043ND&#039;s local LAN facing interface (192.168.1.4) works fine. Any idea on what I can do to get closer to the problem?</p>									</div>

Not sure why I need to use the eth1.1 device here, when I effectively use the default (untagged) configuration for the LAN (which uses eth1) and only add a second, tagged VLAN to one of the ports.</p>									</div>
