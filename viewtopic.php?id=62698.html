					<p>It took me a long time to find out that it is actually very easy to connect to a WPA Enterprise network wireless, for example eduroam, so I wanted to share it. I was put on the wrong foot by all the guides &amp; howto&#039;s on configuring wpa_supplicant files. You dont need to do all that. You can do everything through your browser. (The only exception to that seems to be the case where you have to put in an anonymous identity. Then it is more complicated).</p><p>Here is what you do if you have a router that is able to run on openwrt (not sure about additional requirements regarding technical feasibility). I used a TP Link WR841ND myself, which is very cheap. For the method I describe hereunder I used a cable to connect my computer with router to do the set up. I connected the cable to a LAN port.</p><p><strong>1. Install openwrt</strong>, see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing">Installing Openwrt</a>. <br />Method 1 is the most easy. With this method you just have to find out which file you need based on your router, see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start"> hardware list</a>, and then log in to your router using a browser (using the standard ip adres for that router). YOu still make use of the original software on the router. Now select update firmware, where you select the appropriate openwrt file. After the update openwrt is installed and ready for use.</p><br /><p><strong>2. Remove wpad-mini and install wpad </strong><br /><span class="bbu">Option A</span> Use internet connection on your router. The most easy method is to do this through the web interface (Luci) that comes with the standard Openwrt package, but you need an internet connection to your router for this first. I used my mobile phone to create a wifi, and connect the router to that by setting up a wifi network. </p><p>Go to: Network -&gt; wifi. Here you can set up the wifi connect to your phone. I ticked the &quot;wwan&quot; option, but I think this is router specific.</p><p>Now you go to System -&gt; Software and update package list. Remove wpad-mini and install wpad from Available packages. </p><p><em>In case it doesnt work: I have noticed the web address with the packages is sometimes off line. Under System -&gt; Software, Configuration you can find the address of the website. Copy past in your browser to see if that caused the problem.</em></p><p><span class="bbu">Option B</span>&nbsp; Use Putty (&amp;WinSCP). Download the wpad package on your computer and put in on router using SCP (use Putty, or WinSCP, which is very easy to use: I like the visual aspect). You just need to log in through &quot;root@192.168.1.1&quot; for example. Put the .ipk file in the folder /tmp. Then use Putty to do:<br />cd /tmp<br />opkg remove wpad-mini<br />opkg install wpad-xxxx.ipk</p><p>If you have problems with the exact commands, see <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2013/09/wpa-enterprise-wired-openwrt-wa901nd/">this very old guide</a></p><br /><p><strong>Set up wifi client connection with the enterprise network </strong><br />See under 2.A how to set up wifi. Just you have more options now for the enterprise wifi (if the extra options dont show up immediately, then you probably have to reboot first to make wpad active). The provider should be able to give you the required information about the protocols.</p><p><strong>Add Access Point</strong><br />Assuming you want to have wifi access from your home devices you just add a &quot;Master&quot; wifi, also under Network -&gt; Wifi. Tick the &quot;lan&quot; connection, and set security setting.</p><p>Now you should be connected to wifi and have your router function as an Access Point. I have no clue about the standard security settings, so I have no clue how safe you are now... but at least you should be connected.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sponsert</strong> on 12 Feb 2016, 20:21)</p>
