					<p>I think I have a music player based on a WRTSL54GS finally working, but there is still two issues left, one of which I can leave to later.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had trouble finding a a lot of the answers, so I hope this is something so simple I&#039;m overlooking it.</p><p>When I boot the device, it detects the speakers and everything is set up just fine.&nbsp; If, however, I remove the speakers and plug them back in, /dev/sound/dsp and /dev/sound/mixer disappear and all I have is /dev/sound/unknown.&nbsp; If I use lsusb, I get the same listing I always do, so I suspect the USB drivers are detecting the device when it&#039;s plugged back in (they catch when it&#039;s gone).&nbsp; That makes me think it&#039;s the sound system, or ALSA, that isn&#039;t detecting the speakers when they&#039;re reconnected.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked through /etc/init.d to see if there was an obvious startup script for sound but there isn&#039;t one and I can identify the other services the files start and stop.</p><p>What do I need to do to make sure speakers are detected if they are unplugged and either plugged back in or replaced with a new set?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
