					<p>Other than the fact that they start out on different VLANs, is there any real difference between the WAN port and ports 1-4?&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s not my real question.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I&#039;m wondering about:</p><p>Skipping the wireless side of things entirely, I&#039;ve got two phone lines, both with DSL.&nbsp; The plan was to switch from one to the other but I want to investigate this first.&nbsp; It&#039;s an easy guess that one line has more bandwidth than the other.</p><p>Is there a way to hook a WRT54GS to TWO ethernet modems, and balance the incoming/outgoing load between the two of them, so that one host could take advantage of the sum bandwidth of the two lines?</p><p>Would there be any restrictions, such as a single TCP/IP connection couldn&#039;t take advantage of both lines, but one connection could be routed along line A and another connection could go along line B?</p><p>I thought that if WRT54GS ran two instances of dhcpclient, it could get two different IP addresses, two different routes to the Internet, etc, and there&#039;d need to be some kind of intelligent routing going on, because lines A and B could conceivably be assigned addresses within the same network (same ISP) or they could be on&nbsp; independent networks.</p><p>Narrowband, trying to get a little bit wider.</p>									</div>

					<p>Apart from a few lines in the firewall script to NAT over the wan ports, there&#039;s no difference between the LAN and WAN. Infact, you can create a number of vlans using the vlan*port nvram variables to map it to ports on the switch.
