					<p>I hope someone has some insight into this issue.</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to setup a RouterStation Pro with wifi client using the ath5k driver. The wireless card I&#039;m using for this testing is the XR2 from Ubiquiti. I know madwifi works best for the RSP, but I need ath5k for 802.11s support. I&#039;ve tried quite a few different snapshots of various releases, and even built trunk and backfire a few times attempting to get this working. </p><p>The strangest thing is that I can connect just fine to an access point if it is un-encrypted/open. It gets a DHCP address and routes client traffic just fine. Only if the access point is encrypted with something, WEP, WPA, WPA2, it fails to get a DHCP address and normally route traffic. I tried assigning an IP manually, and it works to ping the access point, but attempting to transmit data with a package update or wget of the routers login page fails to send the packets. I&#039;ve tried connecting to a Linksys, Cisco, and another RSP running madwifi or ath5k access point, with no success. The only thing I can think may be the problem is wpa-supplicant not decrypting correctly, but the config generated looks good, and the client seems to have been setup correctly. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Even a point in the right direction. This is my first post so if I need to include more info, please let me know. Thanks.</p><p>I&#039;m currently using a snapshot image of Backfire 10.03 r20728. I installed kmod-ath5k, hostapd, ip and wpa-supplicant to get the basics working. I&#039;m attempting to connect to a Linksys WRT610N with a 10 digit WEP key. Here is some more info from my build / configuration: </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>dmesg | grep ath wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>ath5k 0000:00:11.0: registered as &#039;phy0&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
