					<p>Hi folks, <br />For our project we use configuration diff files to configure our OpenWRT build. I couldn&#039;t find documentation on this, so I&#039;ve added something: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#configure_using_config_diff_file">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build … _diff_file</a></p><p>Feedback is much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, you can copy the config diff to .config instead of appending it, and a `make defconfig&#039; will expand that to a full config. No idea if that makes much of a difference.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks lems. I&#039;ve tried to incorporate that into the wiki. </p><p>If you have more details on using the diffconfig.sh script that would be great to. It could use some usage information, some usage comments in the file or even better a --help command. </p><p>On git I see &quot;nbd&quot; is the author, but I couldn&#039;t find more info on him/her. <br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=history;f=scripts/diffconfig.sh;h=350886bff26f81db1cbfc0b5f45e657ee4608995;hb=HEAD">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a … 95;hb=HEAD</a></p>									</div>

					<p>The current wiki article contents look ok to me. diffconfig.sh just creates a diff compared to global &quot;no-device&quot; defaults.</p><p>Appending the recipe/changes may leave unnecessary stuff to your .config. Usually it is better to just replace the old .config totally.</p><p>One additional tip: using the plain diffconfig output is principally ok, but it still contains unnecessary stuff, as all packages pulled in due to dependencies are listed.</p><p>After some manual investigation work you can manually prune it to contain only the &quot;top&quot; packages and delete the ones pulled in&nbsp; by dependencies. E.g. luci-app-sqm pulls in the actual sqm-scripts, so only the luci-app-sqm is needed.</p><p>My own recipe is included as an example in this thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=276103#p276103">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 03#p276103</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 29 May 2015, 12:40)</p>

					<p>I would still like to leave the append part since that allows applying changes to a config that was already tweaked. It&#039;s also hard to guess that this is possible.</p><p>The manual investigating into which are the &quot;top&quot; packages seems like something that should be automated. </p><p>Interesting topic btw, we can improve our current docker buildroot system with that info. <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=277949#p277949">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 49#p277949</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/Doodle3D/openwrt-buildroot-example">https://github.com/Doodle3D/openwrt-buildroot-example</a></p>									</div>
