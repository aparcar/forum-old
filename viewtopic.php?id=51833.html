					<p>Hello,</p><p>today I tried to flash a TP-Link Archer C5 v1.2 with the newest self compiled trunk image. </p><p>After the flash the unit rebooted but the ethernet light stayed dark, only the power, the second and one of the wifi lights are constantly on. The router didn&#039;t respond to pings.</p><p>Next I tried to reset it, only holding the Reset button. After a few seconds also the WPA light turned on. Still no response to pings.</p><p>Then I tried the Archer C7 method with holding power and reset and starting an TFTP server on 192.168.1.66. Neither Wireshark nor the running TFTP server grabbed a response. I tried it with differen ethernet ports, but no reaction from the router.</p><p>Now my question, did I hard brick the router or is there still hope? I&#039;m doing this in my parents house and my soldering iron and serial cable are 300km away. So I would appreciate any tips to revive it from the dead.</p>									</div>

					<p>Didn&#039;t know that Archer c5 is supported. Is there any thread about it ? Because according wikidevi the flash size is 8mb but the image file in trunk files is 16mb ( same as archer c7 v2).</p><p>Any dev here would like to chime in ?</p>									</div>
