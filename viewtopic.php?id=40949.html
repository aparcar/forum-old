					<p>Hello All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember when this discussion first came up about a year ago, and after experimenting with infinite Arduino/RPi/BeagleBone/GPS/GSM combos in that time span, I am still amazed at the simplicity and effectiveness of this solution!&nbsp; Now that OpenWRT is making the rounds on the Arduino Yun, I wonder how it might be modified and perfected for that platform?&nbsp; The Yun is basically an Arduino Leonardo connected to a wr703n with a dedicated library taking care of all the serial connection headaches.&nbsp; It even uses a polished version of the Luci GUI!&nbsp; I noticed both GPSD and GSM-Utils are available in the YUN Package Manager and I&#039;ve used GPSD on the RPi with no trouble whatsoever.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If the GPS inputs come in through the Arduino side, and the USB port is used for a GSM dongle I wonder how much the original Python gpslogger.h program would need to be modified?</p>									</div>
