					<p>Hi there, I am trying to set up my tp-link router as LTE modem. I&#039;d like it to bridge data to my 2nd LAN connected router which going to handle all the WiFi, DNS, and NAT. I&#039;ve tried to just plug it into the LAN port and while it works fine, I am getting double NAT error in PLEX since both modem and router have NAT enabled. Any idea how can I have Openwrt in bridge mode? I&#039;ve read something about Dumb AP but not sure if fits my need that? I know it should be straight forward but am pretty new to all this, appriciate your help.</p><br /><br /><p>**Model:** TP-Link Archer MR200<br />**Firmware Version:** LEDE Reboot 17.01.0 r3205-59508e3 / LuCI lede-17.01 branch (git-17.051.53299-a100738)<br />**Kernel Version:** 4.4.50</p>									</div>
