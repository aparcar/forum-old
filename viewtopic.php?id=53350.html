					<p>I&#039;m trying to set up firewall rules to block traffic from a specific computer. I set up a couple of firewall rules using LUCI that I thought might work and put them so they appear first in /etc/config/firewall:</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;BlockICMP&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;icmp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src_mac &#039;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *I changed the mac address for this post, it is correct in my config<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;REJECT&#039;</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src_mac &#039;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;*&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;REJECT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;block_all_traffic&#039;</p><p>I went to my target machine (Windows 7) that I am trying to block and &#039;pinged&#039; the router, expecting to get no response and all my packets dropped. Instead I got the usual &#039;Reply&#039; with 4 packets sent and 4 received. I even put a LOG statement in the &#039;reject&#039; section and my log message appears in the log. </p><p>Can someone explain why I am getting a response to my ping command on the machine I&#039;m trying to block?</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
