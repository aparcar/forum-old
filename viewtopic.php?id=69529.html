					<p>Dear OpenWRT <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Dovado Tiny AC is listed as supported by OpenWRT (DD-trunk). However, no detailed installation guide is in the Dovado Tiny AC openWRT page.</p><p>I tried to install open-WRT image (openwrt-ramips-mt7620-tiny-ac-squashfs-sysupgrade) with web-interface, gives error (apparently does some checking). Then I tried 30/30/30 boot to recovery mode with lan connected. Does not connect TFTP (with putty) to addresses 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1,192.168.254.1.</p><p>Generic &quot;Installing openWrt&quot; lists details to find out prior to connection:<br /> Before proceeding you need to determine the following:<br />- the preset IP address of the bootloader (not necessarily identical to the IP address the device has after it has booted the original firmware!)<br />- the protocol and whether the bootloader acts as client or as server<br />- the correct port number (if not default)<br />- the interface you need to connect to<br />- a user name and login password (if necessary)<br />- the time window you have after starting the device to obtain a connection</p><p>How do you find out these settings? I know Dovado uses U-boot, it has its own recovery program which instructs to set PC lan address to 192.168.1.150 but does NOT say what is the address of Dovado in recovery mode...</p><p>Has anyone succesfully installed open-wrt to Dovado Tiny AC?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>scorpius_79</strong> on 24 Jan 2017, 13:09)</p>

Like i posted, none of them work as I dont know what is the IP of bootloader. How do I find this out or do I have to access router via serial?</p>									</div>

					<p>I hooked up a terminal, and that gave me the clues. My device started up a tftp server on 192.168.1.6:69. If I configure my IP address as 192.168.1.150/24, I could send a file to the device.<br />It was not, however, accepted. Incorrect checksum, according to the device. I might have the wrong image. I&#039;ll post any progress here.</p>									</div>
