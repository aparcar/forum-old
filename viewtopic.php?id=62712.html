					<p>I am using OpenWrt with a raspberry pi and put a RTL8192CU wifi usb card on it. I looked at several threads here and tried some wifi options suggested in some of them but nothing seems to help.</p><p>I run iperf and get around 1 mbit, meanwhile luci shows 70+mbit connection speed. The devices are quite close but still 2-3m apart.</p><p>I check realtime graphs, the wireless, phy rate is floating between 64mbit and 63mbit. I am not sure what it is suppose to show? When my phone connects, it goes to 2mbit. If the other phone I have connects, it goes to 63-64bit, also does the same for a PC.</p><p>Any ideas on what to do next?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;

					<p>I have a ralink card too and I also dont get more than 15mbit from it. So, if broadcom, realtek and ralink doesnt work, what should we use?<br />I have an edimax 3g-6200n also and it also performs very badly (it has a ralink soc also). I wonder why, because it used to work fine with the original edimax firmware. There must be a solution somehow. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Anyway, which chipsets work fine? Even then, it is not so easy to tell which product has which chipset. I am having difficulty finding a working chipset. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>
