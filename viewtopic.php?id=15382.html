					<p>Hi All!</p><p>I have a few problems with my multifunctional HP PSC 1315 on whiterussian 0.9. i managed to set it up to print and scan but...</p><p>First i got the HPLIP sane plugin from this topic <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14831">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14831</a> by misha680. this had cups as dependency (which i tried to remove but it will break scanning too).</p><p>saned -d128 followed by scanimage -L in another window/computer would detect the correct scanner:</p><p>C:\sane\bin&gt;scanimage.exe -L<br />device `net:192.168.1.1:hpaio:/usb/psc_1300_series?serial=XXXXXXXXXXXX&#039; is a Hewlett-Packard psc_1300_series all-in-one</p><p>with same command saned -d128 and xsane on another windows machine i can scan just fine up to 600dpi.</p><p>however after installing xinetd and setting up saned there, i get this:</p><p>scanimage -L<br />[sanei_wire] sanei_w_array: DECODE: maximum amount of allocated memory exceeded (limit: 1048576, new allocation: 3720202640, total: 3721251216 bytes)<br />Segmentation fault</p><p>and the syslog:</p><p>Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.debug saned[3101]: quit: exiting <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.debug saned[3101]: process_request: bad status 22 <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.info cupsd[900]: REQUEST localhost - - &quot;POST / HTTP/1.1&quot; 401 0 <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.err saned[3101]: io/hpmud/musb.c 1950: invalid serial id string ret=-1 <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.err saned[3101]: io/hpmud/musb.c 135: unable get_string_descriptor -1: Operation not permitted <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.err saned[3101]: io/hpmud/musb.c 1945: invalid product id string ret=-1 <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.err saned[3101]: io/hpmud/musb.c 135: unable get_string_descriptor -1: Operation not permitted <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.debug saned[3101]: init: access granted to root@127.0.0.1 <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.debug saned[3101]: check_host: access by remote host: 127.0.0.1 <br />Apr 20 01:47:37 ow01 kern.debug saned[3101]: saned (AF-indep+IPv6) from sane-backends 1.0.18 ready </p><br /><p>i understand that this is a failsafe to avoid bad memory allocations (only 1MB is allowed and this tries to get over 3 gigs of it)</p><br /><p>secondly, i could not make cups work and getting rid of it kills my little saned/hplip functionality.</p><p>but i did make it print through p910nd - just set up the printer locally (because the 1315 doesnt show up in the drivers list i had to actually connect the USB and then after it was installed modify the printer and add a new port for RAW with the router&#039;s IP and port 9100).</p><p>however after scanning i can&#039;t print anymore because /dev/usb/lp0 disappears and that&#039;s smth hplip are aware of here: <a href="http://hplip.sourceforge.net/troubleshooting/printing.html">http://hplip.sourceforge.net/troublesho … nting.html</a> in issue 4. even worse, running this command: <br />/usr/lib/cups/backend/hp - which appears to be the HPLIP printer driver for cups - will give me a Segmentation fault.</p><p>i&#039;m not sure if the issues are from the compilation of the hplip package (appears to be compiled for kamikaze 7.09 not whiterussian 0.9) or if it&#039;s smth else i can&#039;t find.</p><p>i would compile it myself - but fiddling around with the packages and the toolchain/svn of whiterussian for a few days did not yield any results and i&#039;m not a linux newbie either so it&#039;s even more frustrating...</p><p>Help is appreciated - maybe someone has a whiterussian compiled version of HPLIP or HPOJ or HPIJS to begin with...</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>fixed this. installed Kamikaze 7.09 (kernel 2.4 for my asus wl500gp) and misha&#039;s driver. saned works as a real daemon in xinetd and printing works using the cupsd (installed as a dependency to hplip). no need for p910nd.</p><br /><p>here are the instructions for others:</p><p>install this: <a href="http://misha680.googlepages.com/hplip_2.7.12-2_mipsel.ipk">http://misha680.googlepages.com/hplip_2 … mipsel.ipk</a><br />- it will install lots of dependencies.</p><br /><p>For SCANNER:</p><p>set up saned<br />add 192.168.1.0/24 in saned.conf</p><p>add &quot;hpaio&quot; in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf</p><p>test:<br />on your router: saned -d128</p><p>download xsane on windows, set up net.conf with server IP<br />C:\sane\bin&gt;scanimage.exe -L<br />device `net:192.168.1.1:hpaio:/usb/psc_1300_series?serial=XXXXXXXXXXXX&#039; is a Hewlett-Packard psc_1300_series all-in-one</p><p>Good. now set it up as daemon:</p><p>install xinetd, set up sane section, create /etc/services (same sane-port):</p><p>put&nbsp; allowed IPs in /etc/sane.d/saned.conf (like 192.168.1.0/24)</p><p>create /etc/services with the line: sane-port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6566/tcp</p><p>create /etc/xinetd.d/sane:</p><p>service sane-port<br />{&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; socket_type = stream<br />&nbsp; server = /usr/sbin/saned<br />&nbsp; protocol = tcp<br />&nbsp; user = root<br />&nbsp; group = root<br />&nbsp; wait = no&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; disable = no&nbsp; <br />}</p><br /><p>/etc/init.d/xinetd enable (so it starts up after reboot)</p><p>/etc/init.d/xinetd start</p><p>now you can once again try scanimage.exe -L or xsane on windows and it should scan.</p><br /><p>PRINTER:</p><p>remove comments for application/octet-stream from mime.convs &amp; mime.types (in /etc/cups)</p><p>try this: /usr/lib/cups/backend/hp - has to work and display your printer:</p><p>direct hp:/usb/psc_1300_series?serial=XXXXXXXXXXXX&quot;HP psc 1300 series&quot; &quot;HP psc 1300 series USB XXXXXXXXXXXX HPLIP&quot; &quot;MFG:HP;MDL:psc 1300 series;CLS:PRINTER;DES:psc 1300 series;SN:XXXXXXXXXXXX;&quot;</p><p>Great! now... start cupsd from init.d (./cupsd start)</p><p>go to the cups on the router:</p><p><a href="http://192.168.1.1:631">http://192.168.1.1:631</a>/</p><p>set up the printer (give it any name, i have psc1315), select the HP 1300 series from the dropdown, RAW printing, etc.</p><p>note that you cant print a test page from cups since it doesnt know how to translate to the printer (the driver is on windows and cups will just send the bytes to the printer)</p><p>set up driver in windows:<br />new network printer, select URL <a href="http://192.168.1.1:631/printers/psc1315">http://192.168.1.1:631/printers/psc1315</a> enter user/pass<br />select model (if not in list select any model, then printer properties update driver from advanced/driver)<br />you must have it already connected to PC once because the driver is not in list and that&#039;s the only way to be able to change it in advanced/driver.</p><p>note that you wont have lp0 or scanner0 in /dev/usb because this driver accesses the device directly - so dont try to troubleshoot that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>asuswrt</strong> on 27 Apr 2008, 01:08)</p>
