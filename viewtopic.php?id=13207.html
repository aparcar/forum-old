					<p>I&#039;ve got openwrt (trunk) running on my Edimax BR-6104 <strong>without</strong> &quot;large file support&quot; LFS. The root.squashfs is just 5.5 kiB smaller. The advantage looks better with uncompressed data, but lzma is doing a damn good job. The difference is hardly worth the effort, but now that I&#039;ve got the patches I won&#039;t throw them away. I&#039;m using gcc 4.1.2, it still emits the shortest code for mips. gcc 4.2.2 is still much worse than 4.1.2.</p><p>The patches for gcc 4.1.2 and busybox are simple and straightforward. But even with my very limited selection I hit two packages, which always expect LFS: udev and openssl need tweaking.</p><p>It&#039;s certainly not feasible to support disabling LFS for all packages, and the size advantage is negligible on devices with reasonable sized flash. Nevertheless, is anybody of the developers interested in my patches? Should I complete an enhancement ticket?</p><p>Bernhard</p>									</div>
