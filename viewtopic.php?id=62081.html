					<p>I have a client who is subletting part of his office.&nbsp; He wants to give the tenants access to the internet without allowing them access to the devices on the network.&nbsp; My proposal is to create VLANs that can not see each other, but have access to the Gateway.</p><p>I currently have a Netgear GS724T, which will define the two VLANs, and a TWC Arris 8620, which will be converted to a bridge.&nbsp; I want to purchase a router that will be connected between the Netgear switch and Arris bridge.</p><p>Is there a list of routers that will run openwrt and support 802.1q, multiple SSIDs that can be restricted to specific VLANs, and provide DHCP across multiple VLANs (ie: 192.168.10.x/24, 192.168.20.x/24, 192.168.30.x/24)</p><p>If not, can anyone suggest a low cost solution for this scenario?</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I think pretty much any multi-port OpenWRT router will do the job. I can personally vouch for at least the TPLINK WR1043ND, WDR3600, and WDR4300, and the GL.Inet 6416A. You&#039;ll need to have a good idea what you&#039;re doing but I&#039;ve used these devices myself to handle multiple VLANs, WiFi SSIDs, Firewall separation, and DHCP pools successfully. Using a typical OpenWRT router with 1 WAN port and 4 switch ports, you could config the WAN port for the Internet, and then divvy up the 4 switch ports into different VLANs, say 2 ports in one and 2 ports in another... or you can put each of those 4 switch ports into its own VLAN and effectively use the device to segregate traffic such that all 5 ports on the device are segregated into different VLANs. I did exactly this with a WR1043ND and it ran stable on OpenWRT for at least 2 years, until I just no longer needed it for that job anymore.</p><p>It&#039;s been long enough though that I don&#039;t recall the config off the top of my head, but I don&#039;t recall it was particularly difficult either.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knetknight</strong> on 11 Jan 2016, 06:27)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the advise.&nbsp; I purchased the WDR4300, and successfully setup the VLAN environment using the Chaos Calmer - 15.05 firmware.</p><p>I&#039;m only having one problem, which I would rate just slightly higher than cosmetic.&nbsp; It appears that ICMP is being filtered by the firewall within the same VLAN.&nbsp; VLAN1 is 192.168.1.x, where the router is 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; Clients within the subnet are able to successfully ping the router, but are unable to ping other clients.&nbsp; While this is minor, it does affect other services that also use ICMP from working correctly.</p><p>I assume that I need to modify a Firewall entry, but I&#039;m not sure what needs to be done.</p>									</div>

					<p>Traffic between nodes in the same VLAN goes directly through the switch, it should not even reach the CPU, and thus it is out-of-reach for the firewall; could you please post your config files here?</p>									</div>

					<p>You can disregard my previous post.&nbsp; After a bit more research, it appears to be the client firewall that it causing the problem, and not the router.</p><p>I am able to successfully ping the netgear switch, a wireless router, a vista workstation, and 2 Win7 machines.&nbsp; I am unable to ping 2 win8 laptops, and a win10 workstation.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing the win8/10 firewalls are set to block incoming ICMP requests by default.</p>									</div>
