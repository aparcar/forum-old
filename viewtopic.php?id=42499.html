					<p>I got a LinkSprite Robot kit that came with a TL-WR703N that was modified to use the TP_IN and TP_OUT to connect through the micro USB to an ATMega168.&nbsp; &nbsp;I discovered that I could receive but not transmit over the Wifi connection.&nbsp; &nbsp;It uses ser2net so I set up a control port to monitor the term side and nothing the ATMega168 sends out shows up.&nbsp; So I opened the TL-WR703N and found that the TP_IN is wired directly to the micro USB connector which then connects through the USB cable to the Tx pin on the ATMega168.&nbsp; The ATMega168 uses 5V TTL and the Atheros AR9331 uses 3.3V TTL.&nbsp; Could this connection have damaged the Atheros AR9331?&nbsp; &nbsp;I was just wondering if anyone else has run into this problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Update-&nbsp; I created a cable to connect the TL-WR703N micro USB connector to the CP2102 TTL to USB cable that came with the kit and the TL-WR703N OpenWRT console works fine on my computer COM port.&nbsp; So the TP_IN pin on the AR9331 is ok.&nbsp; The Arduino Tx pin can also send data through the same TTL to USB cable to my computer.&nbsp; The problem is that I cannot get serial data from the Arduino Tx pin to the AR9331 TP_IN pin.&nbsp; I suspect that there is either a problem with ser2net or some incompatibility between how the Arduino sends and the AR9331 receives serial data.&nbsp; Any information about this issue would be much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I figured out the problem.&nbsp; I had to remove the line &quot;ttyATH0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login&quot; from the /etc/inittab file to prevent OpenWRT from using the ttyATH0 serial port as the console.</p>									</div>
