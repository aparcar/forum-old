					<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>We are trying to breach (modification ) the existing synchronization system of Wireless Access<br />Point (AP) to make AP synchronize (time synchronization) with TDP router for our research purpose&nbsp; (http://ip-flow.dit.unitn.it/projectwireless.html&nbsp; &nbsp;).</p><p>Working with OpenWrt by developing new package.</p><p>We believe that, there should be some modification in beacon generation process<br />and also timestamp, beacon interval field in beacon frame. We may need to change beacon interval field daynamically. Precisely this is like AP will send beacon frame not in a static interval all the time. It can change the interval but before sending in new interval, it should put the new value of interval in the last beacon frame.</p><p>The key question here: How power saving mechanism will be affected, if beacon interval is changed dynamically? <br />If a STA is in “Doze”,&nbsp; power saving mode,&nbsp; Will it be out of synchronization ? </p><br /><p>[ we will be happy to continue discussion ...]</p><p>regards,<br />/CSEDU</p>									</div>
