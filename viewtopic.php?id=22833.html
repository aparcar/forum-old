					<p>Since the clients and the proxy server are on the same network, the return traffic (server-&gt;client) won&#039;t go through the router and won&#039;t get NAT&#039;ed (i.e. your clients are talking an external IP and getting replies from 192.168.1.100).</p><p>To remedy this, try SNAT&#039;ing traffic leaving the router destined for the server (via the POSTROUTING chain).&nbsp; This will force the return traffic back through the router.&nbsp; Something like-</p><p>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 192.168.1.100 -j SNAT --to $ROUTER_LAN_IP</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />Charlie</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion ciscostu but it didn&#039;t do the trick for me.&nbsp; I think I have an even bigger problem than needing to SNAT.&nbsp; A tcp dump running on 192.168.1.100 shows no inbound packets even though a logging rule added to the PREROUTING chain shows the packets are indeed being DNATed.&nbsp; Just to check to make sure I wasn&#039;t insane, I tried using the REDIRECT target instead of DNAT:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_lan -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080</code></pre></div><p>I then fired up an additional httpd listening on 8080 on my WRT and it worked.&nbsp; This leads me to believe that either something is wrong with my DNAT rule, or DNAT is not working properly in Kamikaze.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>imrook</strong> on 18 Dec 2009, 02:38)</p>

					<p>@cyrus_mc:&nbsp; I actually tried the firewall config first, but it didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I then decided to switch to using iptables directly so I could be sure what the rules were.&nbsp; I just reviewed the documentation and tried again with the following config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect

        option src_dport        80           
        option dest_ip          192.168.1.100
        option dest_port        8080</code></pre></div><p>Still no luck.&nbsp; In my google searches, I also found the following: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2558">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2558</a>&nbsp; I do believe something is fundamentally broken with netfilter in OpenWRT.&nbsp; For the short term, I have simply setup a lighthttpd listening on 8080 on my WRT.&nbsp; It achieves my immediate goal, but it is a bit disappointing to know that there is such a serious flaw in the &quot;stable&quot; OpenWRT release.</p>									</div>

					<p>Good option is to set proxy server in other network, but not necessarily phisically. Then outgoing traffic from LAN will be redirected to IP from other network (routed) and reply will also go through router. In that configuration you are able to see IPs of clients machines on proxy server.</p><p>config:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>router&#039;s br-lan IPs: 192.168.0.1/24,
                     192.168.5.1/24
proxy&#039;s IPs: 192.168.0.10/24 (proxy is accessible also in usual way form LAN), 
             192.168.5.10/24 (and has IP from another network, so traffic must be routed by router)
LAN clients&#039; IPs: 192.168.0.50-100/24

firewall rule: iptables -t nat -A prerouting_lan -p tcp -s 192.168.0.0/24 --dport 80 -j DNAT  --to 192.168.5.10:8080</code></pre></div>									</div>

					<p>@imrook: I tested that config some time ago. altough both - router and proxy - was running OpenBSD, it should work fine on linux boxes too.<br />but as I remember now, proxy must <strong>not have</strong> IP from LAN subnet, because route for that network is on-link, so traffic won&#039;t be routed if not SNATed by router. So you must decide - be able to log clients&#039; IPs or easy access from LAN subnet to proxy machine.</p><p>putting it on different subnet isn&#039;t disturbing at all, for access by &quot;network neighbourhood&quot; from windows just run WINS on router or even on proxy and point it&#039;s address in DHCP parameter for clients. any other service is available just like it is in the same subnet as clients, traffic is routed by router.</p>									</div>
