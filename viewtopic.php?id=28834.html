					<p>Well, it looks like a Kamikaze config I have on a little wrt54gl but everything within arms reach is on Backfire now for me and I am doing things differently so I cant directly compare.<br />What does your route table look like, and include a brief overview of the ip topology in yours and their lan.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve went through OpenVPN docs and it stands that this config cannot be done without server reconfiguration, openvpn will not accept routed traffic by default <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> It has to be configured from the server side witch I do not have access</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to be clear, are you trying to connect to other vpn clients, or are you saying that from your router, you *can* connect to non vpn clients inside the server side network, but your openwrt lan clients *can&#039;t*?</p><p>Vpn client presence between other vpn clients is controlled by either the client-to-client directive, where packets don&#039;t even hit the kernel, so filtering requires an openvpn plugin or its wide open, else specific pushed routes advertising the connected subnets which then requires iptables rules to permit forwarding on the server side.</p><p>If the server has client-to-client is enabled, your scenario would work for your wrt or your wrt&#039;s lan unless he used plugins (doubtful).<br />If he advertises routes, yeah who knows what he is permitting.</p><br /><p>If from the router you can connect to the server side network, he has advertised routes but may be filtering based on client side rules, so it&#039;s possible he excludes your lan by permitting connections from your tun ip only.</p><br /><p>Curious what your exact need is...</p>									</div>
