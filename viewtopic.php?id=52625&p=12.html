					<p>Hi, guys,</p><p>I too have a router TP-link archer C2 AC750 and I was able to compile an image using latest LEDE source. I have some experince with flashing, even with jtag, but I don&#039;t want to brick my router. Currently the device is running the latest firmware from EU (I am from Romania). The problem with it is that it randomly stops, sometimes upnp does not work, needs restart, and it has a limited manual dhcp and port forarding list. So I want to give a try to openwrt.</p><p>I read the instructions, but they are not very clear on how to flash for the first time. My questions are:</p><p>1) do I need to flash first the resque image by tftp? or I can flash a factory image directly in stock firmware upgrade dialogue?<br />2) if I set up tftp and the flash file and the IP to 192.168.0.66 and the speed of LAN to 10 MB/s, then when I start the router pressing WPS button the flash starts automatically, or I have to do something else? When should I release the WPS button?<br />3) Can someone provide a very detailed tutorial, evantually in the first post of this thread for flashing for the first time, with links to successful flashing files?</p><p>Kind regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, again,</p><p>Actually, it was quite simple, i set up a linux tftp server and then followed the mentioned procedures and I got a nice openwrt firmware from zaccareal. However, I tried to copile one of my own firmwares compiled from lede source but failed. I am not conected to serial port so I don&#039;t know the error. I try now to compile the image using zaccareal git source and see what happens</p>									</div>

					<p>What are the stock firmware versions that people have upgraded from to OpenWRT via the TFTP method?<br />I am on one of the older firmware versions (151022 and EU by the look of it), but the TFTP method has failed for me (and I have tried just about every possible way to do it) with a timeout error and I am wonder if upgrading to a newer version would help or should I try flashing via the web interface as per post 86?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NamesAreAPain</strong> on 1 Feb 2018, 03:58)</p>
