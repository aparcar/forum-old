					<p>Hi,</p><p>I would like to use sysupgrade in order to flash a firmware while keeping a current configuration folder (/etc/example) (Which is not an openwrt config folder) but not keeping the current&nbsp; /etc/config openwrt config folder (set it to new firmware defaults).</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying few things but nothing has been working.<br />Is it possible?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pparent</strong> on 8 Aug 2016, 12:25)</p>
