					<p>I have an Asus WL-500W running Kamikaze.&nbsp; I am about to purchase an additional IP (making two) from my ISP to help alleviate some connectivity issues with a particular game when both my roomate and I try to play together (it likes to have particular ports open...and if we&#039;re both playing one of us can have a hard time connecting to others).&nbsp; The ISP has recommended connecting a switch to the cable modem, then the computers to the switch.&nbsp; Should work...but is there a way to do this from within my router, to provide some additional security in the form of not automatically making all of the computers ports directly open to the internet....</p><p> I really don&#039;t know where to begin since I&#039;ve never dealt with a connection that has more than one IP assigned to it.</p><br /><p>Edit: Ok so I&#039;ve spent the last 3 hours trying to figure it out on my own...</p><p>having never had a reason to do this, I discovered that in a traditional linux distro it&#039;s possible to create a sub interface, which will allow a single interface to be assigned multiple IP&#039;s.&nbsp; From there it appears that it would be a simple (kinda) matter of iptables to forward the correct ports to the correct computer. </p><p>Problem is I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to handle a subinterface in openwrt...let alone be able to start beating away at the correct iptables.</p><p>This is my current network config file...not sure if that&#039;s where I set up the sub interfaces. </p><p>config switch eth0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0 1 2 3 4 5u&quot;</p><p>#### Loopback configuration<br />config interface loopback<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;lo&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;127.0.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.0.0.0</p><br /><p>#### LAN configuration<br />config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0 wl0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; 255.255.255.0</p><br /><p>#### WAN configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth1&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; dhcp</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Druidjaidan</strong> on 18 Sep 2007, 22:45)</p>

					<p>In the old days you might have need to have multiple interfaces to handle multiple ip addresses.&nbsp; Not so currently. I am not sure how to do it with the openwrt configuration. but from the command line (create a script ?)</p><p>install the ip package this give you access to the new interface into the kernel - its a super set of ifconfig&nbsp; and some of route.</p><p>ip address ( ip a) - gives you access to the addressing information<br />ip link (ip li) - give you access to the link information - mtu queue length etc</p><p>you probably only need ip a, try ip a help, but something like this to add an address</p><p>ip&nbsp; addres add dev &lt;devname&gt; aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/&lt;netmask&gt; </p><p>should do it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok...So I&#039;ve made a ton of progress.&nbsp; In order to get the second IP I do as follows:</p><p>ip addr add dev eth1 label eth1:1 0.0.0.0<br />udhcpc -i eth1:1</p><p>With that I get two different ip&#039;s assigned to the interface and subinterface of eth1.&nbsp; Next step figure out how to get the correct IP&#039;s forwarded to the correct computers.</p>									</div>
