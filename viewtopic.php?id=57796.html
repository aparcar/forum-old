					<p>Hi guys, i installed ddwrt on my wr710n and i wanted to take ddwrt off; so i went to flash stock img onto the wr710n, the upgrade said it was successful and complete, however once i refreshed the router ddwrt was still on.</p><p>I tried numerous 30/30/30 resets and i also tried to push the img file via tftp but i cant get the router in tftp mode.</p><p>Also, i would like to experiment as much as possible with this router, and will most likely really end up bricking it, so i was wondering if i have my (serial/jtag?) equipment shopping list right:</p><p>A Soldering kit.<br />Wires?<br />A Usb to serial adapter</p><p>I got this from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48145">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=48145</a></p><p>The OP said some random binary numbers were coming when he tried to unbrick it and someone followed with a reply saying that a TTL adapter was needed to bring the voltage down to 3.3v, what TTL adapter should i buy as there are many with different sizes and shapes and there is (from looking at it) no way i can connect them together.</p><p>So, what do you guys think i should do ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I recently unbricked the WR710N for the first time.</p><p>Seems like your list is right.</p><p>Yes you&#039;ll need a soldering kit and a USB to serial adapter. And some wires, preferably jumper wires with pin headers, so you can easily connect them to the USB adapter. I used an adapter with the CP2102 chip. There are other chips, of course. My adapter came with some jumper wires, but that probably depends on where you buy it from. Of course, you also can&#039;t reuse them once you solder them on so I suggest you order some wires separately.</p><p>My adapter supports both a 3.3v and 5v output, but the thing is, you don&#039;t need to connect it because the router is already powered on when you plug it in.</p><p>Then you have to solder it on. Although I would suggest soldering on the ground wire somewhere else, because for me it didn&#039;t stay on. I somehow glued it on because i didn&#039;t realize I could solder it anywhere else.</p><p>Here&#039;s the image from the wiki:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/wr710n-serial-soldering.jpg" alt="http://wiki.openwrt.org/_media/media/wr710n-serial-soldering.jpg" /></span></p><p>And this is a different approach i found:</p><p><a href="http://www.lovisolo.com/asterisk/software/openwrt/tl-wr710n_1.jpg">http://www.lovisolo.com/asterisk/softwa â€¦ 710n_1.jpg</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>reitermarkus</strong> on 5 Jun 2015, 18:50)</p>
