					<p>Currently, we are all waiting for reliable wifi drivers from Linksys, and there was going to be a new driver released at the beginning of this month, but it didn&#039;t happen. You might go back to OEM until the wifi issue is worked out. I have heard there may be a flavor or two that is running a older kernel, and wifi seems to be working well with it, so you might search around. <strong>&quot;dd-wrt Brainsylayer r31971. Uses the same drivers, but is using an older 3.18 kernel.&quot;</strong></p>									</div>

					<p>davidc502 is indeed doing a fantastic job.&nbsp; I truly appreciate everything he does and I commend him highly for being in touch and available on this forum.&nbsp; It&#039;s not often that you see a developer who volunteers their own time to not only provide a new product, but also provide support to the product in a timely, professional, and patient manner.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would try to connect with a wired connection. Also make sure your network setup on your client is correct (I once spent the better part of an hour on a similiar problem as yours until I realised my client&#039;s network interface was setup wrong). Also, 192.168.1.1 is the default ip address, did you change that (then maybe try that one)?</p><p>If nothing helps, the WRT* series have a second partition to boot from. To switch them, see <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1x00ac_series#firmware_recovery">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wr â€¦ e_recovery</a>.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MagicSimon</strong> on 15 Apr 2017, 09:53)</p>

					<p>I have been having wifi issues even with oem build.&nbsp; I have since gone to open source to try better but it has intermittent problems.&nbsp; I bought the USB to led dongle (just googling now how to use this thing), as I am unable to flash the oem firmware back using the GUI.&nbsp; </p><p>This is my second router that is upstairs so it is not like I don&#039;t have internet just would prefer stronger signal.&nbsp; Is there any suggestions to what I should do or wait for the updated wifi drivers?</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>hunterwey</strong>, I was close to desperate.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to buy the USB/TTL tool and wait for it to arrive and then go through the process of cracking open the router.&nbsp; So, when I saw this guys video as second on the list for the search term &quot;unbrick wrt3200&quot;, I figured I would give him a try.&nbsp; After all, if he could unbrick his router AND post it on YouTube, I should surely be able to do the same.&nbsp; He is quite the character, but I do appreciate him posting that video.</p>									</div>

Hard bricking of the WRT series is close to impossible. I really don&#039;t get why people defend vendor lock in when it comes to lede but cry when TP-Link does the same. Why didn&#039;t lede fix this in half a year? It&#039;s trivial to address if you just want to. Are they really intent on giving third party firmware a bad reputation?</p>									</div>
