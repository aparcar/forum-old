					<p>After abandoning a &quot;demo&quot; of the Juniper VPN hardware in disgust with their inability to send trained individuals, I have opted to attempt customizing the WRT54GL (v1.1) device for (hopefully) a reliable VPN solution.</p><p>My intentions are as follows:</p><p>Scenario: About 50 remote locations with Cable or DSL Broadband will connect via VPN to our corporate office.<br />Devices (Remote): WRT54GL units will be placed at the remote locations.<br />Devices (Local): Some other termination / concentrator will be on site at our corporate office. We would prefer to NOT use yet another server tower, but prefer some appliance that does not use harddrives. Considering a customized LinkSys or Netgear box that has been verified to handle at least 50 connections.</p><p>We will be using a variety of systems in which L2TP is natively supported as far as software is concerned. (Mac OS X)</p><p>The wireless connection will provide a hotspot that only connects to the internet, preferrably with some sort of splash screen that can force a disclaimer.<br />The ethernet connections are to be forced through a &quot;site to site&quot; VPN back to our corporate office. Any internet access from those ports will be done via a corporate proxy server.</p><p>All remote locations are DHCP and DynDNS is undesirable unless 50 locations can be managed for free.</p><p>The corporate side of things has multiple static IP&#039;s.</p><p>If I CAN happily use another WRT54GL box as a corporate side concentrator, then that would be even better.</p><p>During my initial testing, WhiteRussian 0.9 has been the newest version that even works at all. Every Kamikaze build that I&#039;ve tried leaves me with either SSH or Telnet login but absolutely NO web interface. (No fun to discover this fact)</p><p>If it&#039;s for the best, I could sacrifice the hotspot capabilities and run 2 separate boxes (1 for VPN, 1 for hotspot). VPN is by far the most critical solution to establish.</p><p>Anyone able to help me setup and configure a site-to-site VPN using these boxes would definitely score big points on the &quot;Dude you rock!&quot; list.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you are looking to roll a custom and very sleek solution, you can certainly do that with OpenWRT v0.9.</p><p>I have a setup using OpenVPN to provide a secure tunnel to the remote WRT units. I use ChilliSpot for the captive-portal software on the satellite locations.&nbsp; The remote sites are entirely run with WRT hardware, nothing there other than a UPS, a DSL modem, WRT units, and some other infrastructure devices like switches. This is for a community WISP with scattered POP locations.&nbsp; Oh yeah we use X-10 RF remotes so if a site is having some weird issue in many cases we can do a drive-by and just power-cycle it from the comfort of the vehicle.&nbsp; Central location has a single oldish Linux box with mirrored drives that provides RADIUS, Apache, syslog, and the OpenVPN server and has been up for 366 days now.&nbsp; Central Linux box also runs Nagios and sends me pages when it finds a fault on a field unit, we frequently know about the problem and are working on it before the phone rings.</p><p>However if you are looking for HotSpot-in-a-Box with PhD (Push here Dummy) interface, this is not it.&nbsp; OpenWRT is like Debian, a great Linux Swiss Army knife but not something with a pretty graphical shell from which you can do anything and everything without touching a command-line.</p><p>For consulting work you can PM me and I will give you my hourly rate.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 17 Apr 2007, 07:48)</p>
