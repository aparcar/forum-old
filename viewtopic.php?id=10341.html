					<p>Well I have searched and searched and so far nothing I try seems to work.&nbsp; This is my project.&nbsp; I am advertising a school event and I want to use my Buffalo Router.&nbsp; The basic Idea is, host a page on the router that explains the event.&nbsp; I stick the router in our schools library and anyone that connects to the network will be redirected to the page on the router itself.&nbsp; Now I have tried all of the iptables redirects that I can find and I just can&#039;t seem to get this to work.&nbsp; The closest I have gotten is being redirected to the correct port if I type in my router&#039;s address.&nbsp; Now the most promising redirect seems to be this script</p><p>Redirect via iptables all http traffic directed at port 80 to another port of the router, e.g. port 81, except http traffic to the wanted URL.<br />In my case, wiithout use of br0:<br />/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination ! &lt;ipaddr_URL&gt; --dport 80 -i eth1 -j DNAT --to-destination &lt;ipaddr_router&gt;:81<br />/usr/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination ! &lt;ipaddr_URL&gt; --dport 80 -i vlan0 -j DNAT --to-destination &lt;ipaddr_router&gt;:81<br />3. start via a script &#039;nc&#039; to answer all calls on that port by spitting out a short html message which contains the redirect command. The script, e.g. //etc/init.d/S80redirect</p><p>################################<br />#!/bin/sh<br />IFS=&quot; &quot;<br />while :; do<br />/usr/bin/nc -l -p 81 &lt; /www/redir.html &gt; /dev/null<br />done &amp;<br />################################<br />//www/redir.html:<br />#################################<br />&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Draft//EN&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;title&gt;Auto-Forward index.html&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;Refresh&quot; CONTENT=&quot;0; URL=http://Your_wanted_URL&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;</p><p>&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;If you are not automatically forwarded, please click &lt;a href=&quot;http://Your_wanted_URL&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;HEAD&gt;<br />&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;PRAGMA&quot; CONTENT=&quot;NO-CACHE&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br />&lt;/HTML&gt;<br />##################################</p><p>In this way no http server is needed at all on the router !</p><p>in the above:<br />&lt;ipaddr_URL&gt; = ip address of the website you want the clients to go to.<br />&lt;ipaddr_router&gt; = ip address of the router the clients connect to.<br />Your_wanted_URL = web address of the website you want the clients to go.</p><p>As an alternative to using the script with endless loop with nc you could launch nc from xinet.</p><p>Last edited by doddel (2007-03-24 04:55:00)</p><br /><p>The script looks great, but this too doesnt seem to do anything once it is activated.&nbsp; Can someone help me with this...thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply nbd.&nbsp; I tried that and it doesnt seem to do anything.&nbsp; The script as well might be incorrect.&nbsp; If I type it in over SSH (nc -l -p 81 ...) it gives me the usage information, basically saying I typed in the wrong command.&nbsp; I might try later today...Ive heard of editing the lighttpd 404 error page.....</p>									</div>

					<p>@forlack</p><p>when i type &#039;nc -l -p 81&#039; from ssh on my OpenWrt routers the command prompt doesn&#039;t return as this command makes nc look on port 81 until that port gets queried and nc anwers and exits. So when you get nc&#039;s help text as response something is wrong there already which would explain why you still have problems with getting this to work.<br />The command option -l puts nc in listen mode, -p states the port on which to listen.</p><p>Thinking about what might be the problem it might be that your firewall is blocking connection to the port on which nc should listen. Here this solution is used within the intranet and any traffic is allowed there.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 17 Apr 2007, 14:38)</p>

					<p>Recent versions of Kamikaze include a patch to busybox httpd that I originally wrote for the FON firmware. <br />It allows you to use busybox httpd for redirecting.<br />Simply launch httpd -p 81 -H &lt;hostname&gt; -R &lt;path&gt; -h /www<br />&lt;hostname&gt; and &lt;path&gt; should point at the page that people should be redirected to.<br />After that, use your iptables lines to redirect users to this webserver instance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the input guys.&nbsp; So nbd if i was using httpd i would have to get the newest patch, or kamikaze?&nbsp; Also what would be the hostname and path if I was hosting the page directly on the router....ie&nbsp; -H 192.168.1.1&nbsp; -R /www/page ???</p>									</div>

					<p>@ forlack<br />strange ! When I just type nc this is what I get:<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />BusyBox v1.00 (2006.11.23-22:17+0000) multi-call binary</p><p>Usage: nc [OPTIONS] [IP] [port]</p><p>Netcat opens a pipe to IP:port</p><p>Options:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -l&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; listen mode, for inbound connects<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -p PORT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;local port number<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -i SECS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;delay interval for lines sent<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -e PROG&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;program to exec after connect (dangerous!)<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>It seems you have another version, without the options, of nc than I do but I am not aware ever to have done anything special to busybox compilation options for nc when I compiled my firmware. Sorry to see you loosing so much time on this triviality but I do not know enough about busybox to help you getting the right nc implementation.</p><p>Just checked on one of my much older compilations on another box (2005.09.15) and it gives exactly the same response. Do you perhaps have some other program that is also called nc ? (cd // ; find -name nc)<br />There should be a nc in /usr/bin and /rom/usr/bin, both links to busybox.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 19 Apr 2007, 23:53)</p>

					<p>doddel thanks for the help.&nbsp; I was using x-wrt which just a package deal for openwrt.&nbsp; It comes with busybox 1.21 i believe... I will try a fresh openwrt only build and see if I can get this script working.&nbsp; As well how intensive is this on the router since it is an infinite loop script.&nbsp; Since this router will not be doing any real work besides displaying a web page I dont care if it eats some resources, but if it locks it up.... You said something about xinet.&nbsp; All I know is that it is a super server package.&nbsp; I wont worry about xinet until I get this working.&nbsp; Thanks for the help guys.</p>									</div>

					<p>the difference between the endless loop and using xinet is the number of instances of nc that can exist at the same time. As nc in this particular application only gives a one time response the duration of it reacting to a query is very short, but another query during this time won&#039;t be handled in the loop version; a new instance is only started when the previous one finished. With xinet an instance of nc gets started whenever a query comes in, so more nc processes can exist at the same time. Unless you expect a barrage of queries, you&#039;ll probably won&#039;t be able to tell the difference.<br />So, contrary to your expectation, the endless loop puts an inherent limit to use of resources as it sustains only one nc process at any time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 20 Apr 2007, 21:44)</p>

					<p>Doddle I need you!!! If I have no connection then there is no DNS lookup and therefore no redirect with the script. Is there a firewall setting to redirect all DNS lookups to my page.&nbsp; I have tried messing around with ipsettings with port 53(DNS) with no luck</p>									</div>

					<p>would suggest to make good use of dnsmasq which contains a dns server.<br />Adapt the startup script in //etc/init.d, or adapt /etc/dnsmasq.conf to contain the address option. </p><p>from dnsmasq man pages <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html">http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/do … q-man.html</a> on the address option:<br />&lt;quote&gt;<br />-A, --address=/&lt;domain&gt;/[domain/]&lt;ipaddr&gt; <br />Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given domains. Queries in the domains are never forwarded and always replied to with the specified IP address which may be IPv4 or IPv6. To give both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a domain, use repeated -A flags. Note that /etc/hosts and DHCP leases override this for individual names. A common use of this is to redirect the entire doubleclick.net domain to some friendly local web server to avoid banner ads. The domain specification works in the same was as for --server, with the additional facility that /#/ matches any domain. Thus --address=/#/1.2.3.4 will always return 1.2.3.4 for any query not answered from /etc/hosts or DHCP and not sent to an upstream nameserver by a more specific --server directive. <br />&lt;unquote&gt;</p><p>When you give as ipaddress the address of the router this should function .... <br />Check with logread that dnsmasq starts up properly without error messages after that you have killed it (killall dnsmasq) and have restarted it after having made the changes.<br />Intercept any calls to a port 53 and redirect them to the router&#039;s port 53, similar to the way you handle port 80 calls. Dnsmasq will then always answer &#039;go here&#039; and the port 80 tricks will then be performed.</p>									</div>

					<p>Glad to hear that in the end you have now all ingredients working to do what you wanted to do!<br />* If a browser would be used with an ip number as address input, the port 80 redirect is needed to also guide that kind of traffic to your &#039;answer to all&#039; site because dns isn&#039;t used then. <br />* If the network interface of the client has been provided with a dns server address, e.g. of some internet access provider, the port 53 redirect will be needed to also intercept calls to that dns server and make them to be answered by dnsmasq on your router. So would advise to keep the iptables redirects in.</p>									</div>
