					<p>I&#039;m having problems getting openwrt to work on a&nbsp; Ubiquiti Picostation.<br />Since my original post I broke out the serial console cable and have tried&nbsp; a&nbsp; bit harder to figure out what is going on but am still at a dead end. Hopefully I haven&#039;t missed an obvious post and the new info will attract some hints.</p><p>In the boot I see:<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;20.390000] jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): End of filesystem marker found at 0x0<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;20.420000] jffs2_build_filesystem(): unlocking the mtd device... done.<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;20.420000] jffs2_build_filesystem(): erasing all blocks after the end marker... <br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;24.310000] device eth0 entered promiscuous mode<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;24.310000] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): br-lan: link is not ready<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;24.730000] eth0: link up (100Mbps/Full duplex)<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;24.730000] br-lan: port 1(eth0) entered forwarding state<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;24.740000] br-lan: port 1(eth0) entered forwarding state<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;24.770000] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): br-lan: link becomes ready<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;25.810000] <strong>jffs2: Newly-erased block contained word 0xdeadc0de at offset 0x00000000</strong><br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;25.830000] done.<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;25.830000] jffs2: notice: (966) jffs2_build_xattr_subsystem: complete building xattr subsystem, 0 of xdatum (0 unchecked, 0 o.</p><br /><br /><p>I think the important line is that that last one that jffs2 is not being erased.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve tried a few things and&nbsp; just seam to be&nbsp; going around in circles.</p><br /><p>running firstboot (or /jffs2reset) didn&#039;t help.</p><p>Any hints&nbsp; of where to go with this?</p><p>--------------------vvv----original question----vvvvvv---------</p><p>Hi,</p><p>This seam so basic that I wonder what I&#039;m doing wrong.&nbsp; After reboot the device returns to factor default configuration.&nbsp; Is there another command I need to run to save settings to the memory?&nbsp; I run openwrt in several devices but this is the first time I&#039;ve seen this issue.</p><p>Details:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I flashed a Ubiquity Picostation&nbsp; using the Ubiquiti Bullet M version like the wiki so generously gave me the hint for.&nbsp; The flash and initial boot was great.&nbsp; Configure seemed to be working with changing of IP address/disabling DHCP/wifi tweaks/etc. Actual build is:&nbsp; &nbsp;OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05-rc3 / LuCI Master (git-15.167.71950-8005ecb).&nbsp; The unit runs fine until I do a reboot.&nbsp; Issuing the reboot command or power cycling causes the unit to reboot in the original factory default configuration (no password/default IP/etc)</p><p>slash and /sys filesystems appear to be mounted read/write.

					<p>well&nbsp; after spending more time I&#039;m still at a dead end and am hoping that someone might have a hint.&nbsp; Downgrading to previous versions of&nbsp; openwrt all have the same symptoms.&nbsp; The error is slightly different with errors&nbsp; such as <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;jffs2: Node CRC ffffffff != calculated CRC f09e7845 for node at 00410234</p><p>but regardless it appears that the system can&#039;t write to memory.</p><p>Using the serial debug console I&#039;m not seeing something obvious with the poking around I&#039;ve done. Since I&#039;m doing&nbsp; the upgrade by watching the serial console I&#039;m not seeing anything obviously wrong with&nbsp; the original firmware flash.</p><p>Anyone with hints?</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you/anyone ever get past this issue? I&#039;ve got a Picostation M2 (Bullet M2 board) doing the same.</p><p>The issue may be related to u-boot having been updated in AirOS 5.6.2. Apparently the partitioning changed or something - I&#039;m not quite sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>I never did get this solved. I just put it aside.&nbsp; I think you are on to something about the u-boot being updated.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at the boot sectors and don&#039;t see anything obviously wrong but then again I do see several things I don&#039;t understand and did not find what seamed like current documentation on uboot.</p><p>Still looking for hints.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just a heads up if you are having issues with newer Picostations and openwrt. The bootloader was updated with the new airOS and openwrt is bombing when you try to flash it.</p><p>-reset pico<br />-install the latest version of airOS XM 5.6.3<br />-then downgrade to airOS XM 5.5.11 through the airOS webgui<br />-reset pico<br />-tftp your openwrt bin</p><p>Hopefully this helps!</p>									</div>
