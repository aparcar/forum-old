					<p>@David. I&#039;ve tested the last two releases of your Lede build in my 1900ACv1 but I&#039;m having some problems with DNS.</p><p>DNS assigned by provider doesn&#039;t seem to be used. In the previous one (r3293) it works fine, but not in the latest. It seems that /tmp/resolv,conf.auto (or /tmp/resolv.conf.ppp, I don&#039;t know which one should be used) is ont used at all. If I modify by hand /tmp/resolv.conf the router can get anywhere and download the packages I need, but I think that this should be done automatically. In r3293 it does. And I would prefer DNS servers to be set by my provider, because not only Internet, but IPTV depends on them</p><p>&quot;Use DNS servers advertised by peer&quot; checkbox is checked. I tried unchecking it and checking again, but it does nothing.</p><p>If you want to take a look on this and I can help, I would be glad to do it.</p><p>Regards.</p>									</div>

					<p>@davidc502</p><p>Hi David out of curiosity as you mentioned you hadn&#039;t had much feedback on the WRT1900ACSv2 have you had any reports of the below that i posted on another forum</p><p>&quot;@yuhhaurlin Is it a known issue with the 88W8864 5GHZ driver that devices connected to 5GHZ when the radio is scheduled to turn off do not disconnect and actually stay connected? I have tried stock and DD-WRT firmwares and i have the same issue with all which is obviously due to the driver.</p><p>The 2.4GHZ does not have this issue, devices connected to 2.4GHZ when the radio is switched off are disconnected immediately.<br />@shauno100<br />shauno100 <br />commented about 6 hours ago<br />Also doing a wifi analysis from another device shows the 5ghz is still broadcasting when the schedule has meant to turn off the radio.</p><p>To replicate</p><p>Use a device with 88w8864 chip (im using wrt1900acsv2)<br />Connect a device to 5ghz band<br />Set wireless schedule to turn off both 2.4ghz and 5ghz (linksys stock or custom dd wrt script)<br />When schedule takes affect you will notice the device connected to 5ghz is still connected and using wifi analyzer on other device 5ghz is still broadcasting whilst 2.4ghz is turned off successfully.<br />As mentioned if a device was connected to 2.4ghz instead the issue does not occur and the device would be disconnected immediately and both 2.4 and 5ghz bands would be turned off.&quot;</p><p>I have experienced this issue on both stock and DD WRT and im not sure if OpenWRT/LEDE has a wireless scheduler? as im willing to give it a try.</p><p>Just seems that due to the fact i experience the issue on both stock and DD WRT that it must be a driver bug.</p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Shaun</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shauno100</strong> on 3 Apr 2017, 08:29)</p>

					<p>I hear you both, and understand exactly because I&#039;m affected by DFS not working.
