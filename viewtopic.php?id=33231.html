					<p>DIR-601 B! This is a new Hardware version with a single Atheros AR9331 chip replacing two chips on the A1 board.</p><p>I tried flashing it with openwrt-ar71xxgeneric-dir-601-a1-squashfs-factory which wouldn&#039;t load</p><p>I also tried firmware for a T-link wireless router with the same chipset which also wouldn&#039;t load</p><p>I am unable to find anything useful online, probably because it is new, but the D-Link firmware is 3.58 MB&#039;s, so I assume it must have at least 4 MB of flash memory.</p><p>Does anybody have anything useful to offer on this?&nbsp; I live in Canada, so not sure if it is the same as elsewhere.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I just dug it out from storage. The serial port is the 3 inline, unused solder pads behind the Jumpstart button.&nbsp; Looking at the board from above, on the right side there is an LED, a push-button switch and behind that 4 solder pads.&nbsp; The square solder pad is unused. The front pad is TX, the middle ground, and the rear (next to the square pad) is RX.&nbsp; Remember of course this is a TTL connection and requires a TTL to serial converter.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve recently acquired one of these routers and found out that openWRT has yet to be compatible with it. Not being the kind of person to to idly sit and wait I decided to do a little digging of my own to find out why it might not be taking openWRT or ddwrt firmwares.</p><p>Dlink has released one firmware for this device which has shed some light on the issue. It would appear the firmware is a Linux Image and follows the same structure as version A1 however there is 83 bytes at the very beginning of the firmware which describes things such as firmware number device model board type etc. </p><p>From what I can gather the very first 6 bytes in the firmware need to be set precisely to describe the image which is being flashed. I had tried copy pasting the first 83 bytes into a known working A1 openWRT firmware but the router complained about an invalid configuration. When I set the first 6 bytes all 0 the router appears to accept the image but doesn&#039;t actually flash anything.</p><p>I am posting this information here in hopes that someone can use it and make further progress on what I&#039;ve found. I am perfectly willing to try and flash an image onto my router at the risk of a brick if anyone has any ideas of how to make this work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I got bored today so I opened up my dlink router to see what I might see. It is indeed an AR9331. Noticed that the thing has a whole bunch of extra traces and pinouts I suppose for different revisions. Probably can do a lot of interesting hardware mods with this.</p><p>The thing that caught my attention was at the front of the board there appears to be a pinout for a USB port, however its obviously not connected and is missing parts like resistors. </p><p>Another thing I noticed although once again missing parts the pads are on this board for a second antenna... probably wouldn&#039;t be too difficult to soldering the right parts in place with the right tools.</p><p>Kinda wish I knew more about the software side of things because I would be busy trying to get openWRT on this.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would like to now if you find a way to log into the router that is easier than making a serial connection. A usb port would be interesting. Better would be a ssh or telnet server.</p>									</div>

					<p>I also downloaded the GPL source code. It includes the tool chain for compiling and scripts that make the build process easy. I was able to build the firmware from source and load it onto the router.</p><p>The web inteface works through a cgi program named system_manager. There is no source for system_manager so it is difficult to tell how to use it to add capability through the web interface.</p><p>I was unsuccessful getting a serial connection to work, but I hope to build the firmware with a telnet daemon running so I can telnet into the router and see what is going on when it stops responding.</p>									</div>
