					<p>I have setup my wireless to have to SSIDs, one is for me, encrypted and is unlimited, the other is open and limited. But I am struggling how to limit the bandwidth simply. I am not interested in shaping and such, so <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/qos">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/qos</a> is not an option for me. I just want to give those passing by an 512/128kbit link and then they can do with it as they please.</p><p>The simplest solution was to install wshaper and put the limits to /etc/config/wshaper as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;wshaper&#039; &#039;settings&#039;
    option &#039;network&#039; &#039;wl0.1&#039;
    option &#039;downlink&#039; &#039;512&#039;
    option &#039;uplink&#039; &#039;128&#039;</code></pre></div><p>And it somehow works, but it shapes the traffic anyway and downloads are around 130kbits at maximum, which is lower then I would like it to be. Is not there a simple command that would limit an interface to certain speed? I have seen this question asked a lot but never succesfully answered.</p>									</div>

					<p>i don&#039;t know how wshaper works, but&nbsp; &nbsp;on my home router i use&nbsp; the &quot;teaman&quot; build of Tomato&nbsp; (http://code.google.com/p/tomato-sdhc-vlan/ ) to do something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the GUI it&#039;s the &quot;bandwidth limiting&quot;&nbsp; not the &quot;QoS&quot; settings though under the hood it uses the same QoS functionality&nbsp; ( &quot;tc&quot; stuff).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I was amusingly reminded that i had set this up just last week when i finally upgraded from DSL to cable modem.&nbsp; &nbsp; Plugged in through the modem... speed test was 20+ mbps.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;do it through the router:&nbsp; 2900 kbps&nbsp; every time.&nbsp; &nbsp; Took me a good 10 minutes to realize what was going on.</p>									</div>
