					<p>If you are referring to the DD build the answer is no. As stated on the wiki you will have to install luci via ssh after you flash. Just so you know there was a new mwlwifi pushed today; also I just put up a build with the latest driver in the image.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m currently on CC (wrt1200 v1), but the recs here seem to suggest trunk is a better choice, is there any problem reverting to stock from trunk? Not that i have plans to revert, but i&#039;m sure i&#039;ll sell this router eventually and i&#039;ll revert then, i&#039;m assuming from Villeneuve&#039;s post i need to install Kongs build to revert.</p><p>edit - after looking around a bit, problems reverting seem to be for the wrt1900, not the 1200, although Kong does offer a dd-wrt to factory img for the 1200 as well, that seems to be for dd-wrt only, i don&#039;t see any talk of problems reverting to stock from OpenWrt on the 1200.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikemccartney</strong> on 10 Aug 2016, 20:20)</p>

					<p>My post was only re. dd-wrt back to stock, or to owrt. I have never had a problem going from any owrt image back to stock, or to another owrt image. On a v1 though.</p><p>But as noted CC is built with an old mwlwifi. I believe there is a link somewhere in forum to a &quot;recent&quot; mwlwifi package for CC.</p>									</div>
