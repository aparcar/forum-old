					<p>First time doing anything remotely similar to anything like this. I have two TP-Link WR841N routers, and I&#039;d like to use one as my main router while using the other to extend my wifi signal. I flashed the first one using the proper file from the website, but cannot get internet working at all. I looked at this page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection</a> but don&#039;t really understand what it says. I use basic comcast internet that connects through a modem and then a router. I guess I&#039;m too dumb too really understand all this, so I was hoping someone here could help me.</p><p>Just a quick note: after installing openWRT I messed around the settings and changed the protocol from static IP to DHCP. I couldn&#039;t access the router (through 192.168.1.1 in browser) anymore after that. I followed the other instructions on the site to go into failsafe using telnet, where I typed mtd -r erase rootfs_data. That step finishes, but I would lose connection to my router immediately after, and therefore cannot use the reboot -f command. However, I was able to access the router through 192.168.1.1 afterwards. I don&#039;t know if this changes things, but I wanted to post it here just in case.</p><p>My second question is, I was reading on different ways to extend the wifi signal online. WDS, which both routers supposedly have, is good, but websites say I&#039;m limited to WEP, which is less secure (<a href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1802277">http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-re â€¦ ?t=1802277</a>). Is this true and is this anything a basic internet user has to worry about? Is wifi repeater (which I assume openWRT will allow me to do) a better choice? If so I have to flash both routers in order to get wifi repeating to work right?</p><p>Thanks guys!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>posrep123</strong> on 10 Jan 2014, 07:06)</p>

					<p>What you have to do is 1. run firstboot to ensure you have not any mess left behind. Plug cable modem to wan and now you should have your internet working on switch, it works out of the box.</p><p>2. Enable and edit wifi (vi /etc/config/wireless) and add line &quot;option wds 1&quot; to end<br />3. set your second router as dumb ap (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a>) and change its ip to another one i.e. 192.168.1.2 (vi /etc/config/network), set wifi exactly as on router 1, but set &quot;option mode sta&quot;. It iw good to define also gateway and dns, so the second router will know thou outer world.

					<p>Right. The command firstboot erases settings, so there&#039;s no need to flash firmware again, just reboot router to apply. It is wise to set a password using passwd command, then you will have to ssh to your router (use putty if you&#039;re on windows).</p><p>You can access config files with vi command, i.e. vi /etc/config/wireless, then press a (add mode), and you can edit like with normal text editor. Then press esc :q enter to save settings, you might need esc :!q enter to exit without saving and try again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> There are many commands, you can even copy and paste, but most you can do in add mode, you might yet need ESC d which deletes one line. Rest is in the man (google vi man), I don&#039;t know them all too.</p><p>If you screw up, you can always run firstboot (amd reboot) to revert to original settings.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 10 Jan 2014, 23:15)</p>
