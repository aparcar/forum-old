					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;m trying to seriously build it for tp-link(wr703n). By seriously I mean that if I got router bricked and failed to unbrick it by wiki pages - which will do my best to not to do it - will buy a new one until I learn it :-)</p><p>First, for not to go to wrong direction, I&#039;d like to ask if porting files for targeting the build process toward the wr703n is openly available, or what I should do so to obtain my final image ready for wr703n please?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Yaon</strong> on 13 Nov 2012, 15:23)</p>

					<p>I strongly recommend to have a serial console, so even if your kernel does not boot, you will still have the U-Boot bootloader to restore the router back to work.</p><p>You only need a cheap TTL UART/USB converter, like the Nokia CA42 cable you can find everywhere (just cut the Nokia connector side), and solder 3 wires on the tiny little pads described <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n#serial.console">here</a>.</p><p>This way, you can always restore a working image or even go back to the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n#back.to.original.image">orignial firmware</a> (and you don&#039;t need to buy tons of routers!).</p><p>Thee instructions above are ok, but, I recommend to use the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; branch rather than the &quot;trunk&quot;:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/attitude_adjustment</code></pre></div><p>The &quot;AA&quot; branch is more stable than the trunk, which may be broken from time to time... And the &quot;AA&quot; branch contains also the LuCI web admin interface by default, so it is a little bit easier.</p><p>You do the &quot;make menuconfig&quot; with these &quot;Target&nbsp; System&quot; and &quot;Target Profile&quot;, then:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make -j 3</code></pre></div><p>The &quot;3&quot; should be your number of CPU on your host machine + 1, so &quot;3&quot; is for a dual-core host.</p><p>The first time, it may takes hours to compile, as the toolchain is built first, then the kernel and the rootfs.</p><p>You then obtain in the &quot;bin/ar71xx&quot; subdirectory the &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin&quot; and &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot; files.</p><p>In the case of the TL-WR703N (this is not the case for other platforms), the 2 files are identical, except that the &quot;*factory*&quot; one contains extra 0xff padding at the end to be flashable by the original TP-Link Chinese firmware.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>Squonk, thanks for detail response, I first time learned about AA!</p><p>If possible, I need to ask 3 questions here:</p><p>1. what is the role of &#039;j&#039; in &quot;make -j 3&quot; please?<br />2. I will build under Ubuntu, should I check any special point for such build system?</p><p>I&#039;ve used wrt54gl for a year and flashed router for several times, I got a J-Tag but never such problem happened to use it. From your post I learned that J-Tag is of no use in the case of wr703n (correct?). </p><p>I cross compiled a small socket server successfully, but I&#039;d like to learn more and if possible, embed my code into the router image, so compiling openwrt, I already have my program compiled in it, may be as a driver.</p><p>3. So, which way should I take from these:<br />3.1. compile for the first time, wait that several hours, try altering openwrt source only after tool chain is built so for repeating, less time for waiting.<br />3.2. may be fundamental problem for going 3.1., so I should - if altering code - each time build the tool chain?</p><p>Sorry if questions are foolish-like, it is the first time ever I&#039;m going to build a LINUX ! :-)</p>									</div>
