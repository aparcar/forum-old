					<p>Hi,</p><p>I found that the 2.4G wifi on my Lenovo Y1 router got weak receive sensitivity since 15.05, and the problem still exists in 15.05.1.</p><p>Below is my native test for the issue, because I have less idea about the linux wireless site survey tools.</p><p>ROUND1 - flash openwrt 15.05.1-y1 firmware from downloads.openwrt.org - &lt; BAD RESULT!&nbsp; &gt;</p><p>&nbsp; * Connect an android phone to the router<br />&nbsp; * Open the Luci/Wireless UI and check the signal, the value is about 90%<br />&nbsp; * Move the phone to 5 meters away, and the signal seems dropped dramatically to 60%<br />&nbsp; * Move to another room and the signal will decreased to about 15%, and the ping start reporting some packet lost</p><br /><p>- ROUND 2 - flash some close-source firmware - &lt;GOOD RESULT!&gt;<br />&nbsp; * I then re-flash the device with another firmware called pandorabox openwrt <br />&nbsp; * repeat the above test steps and the signal is 100% at 20 cm away/ 100% at 1meter / 90% at 5 meter / 70+% in another room<br />&nbsp; * no ping packet lost during the test. (both with 2.4/5g)</p><p>I found the difference of the 2 firmwares is the ra0 driver.&nbsp; The pandorabox firmware is using a driver named RT2860v2 for the ra0 device, and found a possible copy of the driver source at <a href="https://github.com/wuqiong/rt2860v2-for-openwrt-mt7620">https://github.com/wuqiong/rt2860v2-for-openwrt-mt7620</a> but I have no idea about why it works.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I believe the pandorabox guys do some tweaks on the driver but they never released the source code from the dmesg info.</p><p>Also, I opened the my device case and checked the PCB. There is no external PA/LNA, so I&#039;m guessing if the official openwrt driver disabled the internal LNA by default ?</p><p>Could you guys please take a look into those issues? </p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Shawn</p>									</div>
