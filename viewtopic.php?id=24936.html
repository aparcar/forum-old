					<p>Hi guys<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> Need help reviving wag160n Annex A version 1 device. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Device status -works as switch or hub. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Led status(when powered on) power-off, wireless-off, adsl-off, internet-off, lan–on(rj45 cable connected).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Power adaptor seems to be ok. No serial console output.Think ive a working Jtag adaptor.(Xilink DLC5).I made backups of cfe ,nvram ,wholeflash etc using brjtag and tjtag3 and compared them,there seems to be no difference. A friend of mine thought I got a device with corrupt or no cfe and suggested to try jtag a working dump of cfe/wholeflash from another device to revive my wag160n. I tried that but I couldn’t get a working dump.(after trying so many forums for cfe/wholeflash). As a last&nbsp; attempt to revive the device, im trying other firmware/bootloader I read a oldwiki page on wag160n and openwrt support for the device. Will someone help me in trying openwrt&nbsp; and different bootloader?.<br />Device info:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Processor:BCM6358 rev1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ram:Etrontech&nbsp; EM6AA160TS-5G&nbsp; &nbsp;16 mb<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flash:MX29LV320CBTC-70G&nbsp; &nbsp;4mb<br />thanks in advance</p>									</div>
