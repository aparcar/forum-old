					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I accidentally copied the image file to 9f000000 address and now my MR3420 Router is completely dead. Console is also not working.</p><p>I tried copying the content of flash from another router TL-WR841N, but the uboot image were different, but the console started working.</p><p>Can anybody let me know from where I can download the Uboot as well as kernel image. I have the ART partition backup but I need to know how to copy it to the flash as the ART partition is locked.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Sreekanth</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sreekanth.a</strong> on 27 Jun 2015, 16:45)</p>

					<p>I think you can extract them from the stock firmware for your model. </p><p>If your stock firmware size is 4063744 bytes, then I believe the first 131584 bytes should be the bootloader. Use DD to extract </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=stock.bin of=bootloader.bin count=257 bs=512</code></pre></div><p>Here, take a look at <a href="http://www.devttys0.com/2011/05/reverse-engineering-firmware-linksys-wag120n/">this</a> page.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes that is what you would do except that you have to erase the existing bootloader in the destination area of flash before you can cp.b into flash.</p>									</div>
