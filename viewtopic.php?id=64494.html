					<p>Dear all,<br />I want to use my OpenWRT router as an client for an public hotspot (e.g. Telekom, Telekom_FON). The Hotspot has an Captive Portal, which redirect the traffic to a certain URL (like telekom.portal.fon.com). <br />Unfortunatly, OpenWRT can&#039;t connect to the URL, so I need to figure out the IP-Adress of that URL. What works sometimes, but often enough the connection to the URL like <a href="https://123.456.789.0/login.php">https://123.456.789.0/login.php</a> doesn&#039;t work,<br />Is there an smart tool, to help with that logon pages ?<br />Thanks,<br />Haudrauf</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Max, <br />I appreciate your help - but that is not realy an answer you&#039;ve linked right ?<br />Be confident, I have alread searched google and this forum, but can&#039;t find any answer to my issue.<br />I can&#039;t even SEE the logon (Splash) screen, which I most probably need, even when I apply this approach:<br />&quot;Hotplug + curl/wget script&quot; - I don&#039;t even understand, what that means <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />Thanks, Marc</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Max, thank you your your detailed help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />I try to explain it with other words.<br />My issue is not, to technically connect to another Hotspot. I can create the connection (interface), but I not able to access the captive portal of that Hotspot.<br />E.g. Telekom (Germany): They forward all traffic before authentication to <a href="https://hotspot.t-mobile.net">https://hotspot.t-mobile.net</a> - but OpenWRT (or my device, I&#039;m not sure which one), can&#039;t resolve the name. Instead, I have to replace the hotspot.t-mobile.net with that IP (which I can ping from the command line). However, this doesn&#039;t work always, and it&#039;s really difficult (for me) to find out the real IP-adress. And it seems, that this approach is sometime not allowed / supported from the Hotspot-Provider.<br />Thanks for your time &amp; help.<br />Marc</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi haudrauf,</p><p>I&#039;ve had the same issue and posted a question here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=322566">OpenWRT Roadwarrior behind Captive Portal</a><br />After some research I found a solution for this. You may want to have a look at that post as I guess it solves your problem.</p>									</div>
