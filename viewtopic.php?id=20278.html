					<p>Hi,</p><p>This is the brief:<br />I want the WRT to connect to a WEP wireless network and be able to offer a local WPA network on the same box.</p><p>WAN --WiFi-- WRT --Wifi/Switch-- LAN</p><p>AFAIK, this is what is commonly called a &quot;Repeater Mode&quot; or a &quot;Wireless Client + AP&quot;.<br />I can easily get it working with DD-WRT, but since I quite HATE that firmware I really need to get it working on OpenWRT!<br />I&#039;ve done a lot of tries but I didn&#039;t succeed yet. I&#039;ve also tried recompiling the latest svn and changing kernel+wifi driver.</p><p>What am I missing? Any advice?</p><p>10x a lot!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, everything looked correct.
