					<p>I recently built a new image of Kamikaze based on the last sources from svn (r12632) for my Linksys NSLU2.<br />Since I have upgraded my NSLU2 with this new image, I&#039;m unable to access it.<br />The NSLU2 simply not answers to ping, telnet... but seems to get an IP from DHCP and answers to ARP requests.<br />Many changes were applied since my previous build that worked fine with some patches, a revision r11895 built on July 21th (and that for example still used ipkg).<br />I just don&#039;t understand what&#039;s happening now...<br />Is anything known as broken in the current svn files for the NSLU2 ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>GLR</strong> on 19 Sep 2008, 21:33)</p>

					<p>Problem solved : I don&#039;t know how but iptables was back included in the image.<br />And on a NSLU2, to have iptables enabled with a default config is disastrous : no more access !</p>									</div>
