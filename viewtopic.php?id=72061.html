					<p>Hello,</p><p>Background:<br />After installing and running tcpdump on my old WRT54GL, I could never get it running perfect.&nbsp; The router has only 2MB of memory, so I was saving the tcpdump outputs (pcap) on my local machine via an SSH connection.&nbsp; tcpdump, however, would also copy the data from my SSH connection and snowball into oblivion.&nbsp; I could never get tcpdump functioning perfectly, mostly I believe, because vlan and/or ipv6 were not playing well with my commands.&nbsp; I messed with vlan settings in OpenWRT and eventually locked myself out of the router, thinking it was bricked.&nbsp; Lots of troubleshooting and I&#039;m now back to square one on a clean OpenWRT build (firmware- OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 / LuCI 0.10.0, and kernal-2.4.37.9).</p><p>More research led me to &quot;Port-Mirroring&quot;.&nbsp; I think this may be a simpler way to accomplish my goal.&nbsp; I want to analyze packets from a wireless client (smartphone app) on my local machine with wireshark.&nbsp; This is in a lab setting, and seems like it should be straight forward.</p><p>Bottom line:<br />Can anyone tell me if port mirroring is a function in openwrt? I cannot find that info.&nbsp; If it is not, is the iptables TEE command still a viable option for me?&nbsp; To be clear, I want to copy and forward (mirror) all my router&#039;s wireless traffic to my PC over ethernet. I&#039;ll continue reading about the subject, but I&#039;m hoping an experienced person can point me in the right direction as I fumble through.</p>									</div>

					<p>Time to upgrade to a 1900acs or 3200acm where you can simply log pcaps directly to USB <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; &nbsp; With tcpdump, you can set it to roll the logs when the USB device is full. Set up a file share on the USB and pull those PCAPS down to your machine when needed.</p><p>Sorry, I&#039;ve never set up port mirroring, but don&#039;t know how well it will work that that dinosaur anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><p>If anything the 1900ac old Version 1 is available on Ebay pretty cheap these days, and it will easily do the job.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for the heads-up.&nbsp; You&#039;re probably right that I should stop trying to make this dinosaur work; it just seems like such a simple task.&nbsp; With that said, I&#039;ve got at least 5x WRT54x&#039;s in my lab so no one would bat an eye if I brick one (like i thought I did before).</p><p>I&#039;ve got a handfull of other devices, I may need to just go through them 1 by 1 and look up the specs. Some may be running openwrt already, or something similar, and meet my needs out of the box.&nbsp; The buffalo I messed with has a USB port, but it&#039;s somehow configured by factory to only be used for firmware upgrades.</p><p>You&#039;ve motivated me to go through these various models 1 by 1 now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paddy1337</strong> on 14 Sep 2017, 19:49)</p>

					<p>Since ssh works, you could pipe the output of tcpdump to &#039;nc&#039; which you would catch the stream on another machine. Netcat &#039;nc&#039; is very handy for these kinds of things.

					<p>Sorry about the filters. It does sound like if tcpdump-mini is ignoring your filter. A simple way to test this is to run something like this:</p><p>tcpdump -i br-lan -c 100 not port 22</p><p>If you see SSH in the capture, then the filter isn&#039;t working. BTW, I put the &#039;count&#039; in there so I don&#039;t loose control of tcpdump if there is too much output.</p>									</div>
