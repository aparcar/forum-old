					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;m pretty new to OpenWRT and am implementing a feature where I need to detect if a wifi client has been idle for some time. At first I used the ARP table, because entries would get deleted after a certain period of idle time and that way I could easily detect a &quot;timeout&quot;. However, recently I upgraded to trunk r40554 and the ARP entries don&#039;t get deleted from the table anymore. They seem to stay there until reboot regardless of what happens with the client meanwhile.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s any way to change this or if there&#039;s an alternative way of achieving what I need.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rohe</strong> on 29 Apr 2014, 12:04)</p>

					<p>You could have gotten an answer faster yourself using google. I searched for: linux arp cache timeout</p><p> and the first google&nbsp; result is:</p><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15372011/configuring-arp-age-timeout">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1537 â€¦ ge-timeout</a></p><p>Based on what you&#039;ve written, the first answer on that page explains what you want to know about the arp cache behavior.</p>									</div>
