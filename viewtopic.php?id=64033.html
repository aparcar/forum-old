					<p>Hi, <br />maybe sb can help me out, since I cant figure it out for days now.</p><p>My setup is as follows:<br />clients (192.168.1.x) &lt;--&gt; openwrt LAN Port (192.168.1.92) || open wrt WAN Port (192.168.1.93) &lt;--&gt; router 1 (192.168.1.1) &lt;----VPN &amp; InternetGW----&gt; router 2 (192.168.2.1) &lt;--&gt; clients (192.168.2.x)</p><br /><p>The VPN between router 1 and router 2 is working fine. My clients from 192.168.1.x can ping 192.168.2.1 and clients at 192.168.2.x. Also I have internet access when 192.168.1.x clients set 192.168.1.92 as gateway and 192.168.1.92 sets 192.168.1.1 as gateway.</p><p>The Problem is, that no client from 192.168.1.x can ping 192.168.1.1. Clients from 192.168.2.x can ping 192.168.1.1 but not 192.168.1.92 or clients at 192.168.1.x.</p><p>When I add the WAN port to the VLAN1 (where the LAN Ports are active) at openwrt switch configuration everything works as expected (obviously). So my guess is that it is a firewall issue. The point I&#039;m not getting is: even if I allow everything in the openwrt firewall&nbsp; (LAN &amp; WAN: accept input, accept output, accept forward, allow forward to, allow forward from) the problem persists.<br />I would think, if I allow everything, the firewall shouldn&#039;t interfere? Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
