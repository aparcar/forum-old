					<p>Hi All! </p><p>I&#039;ve configured the statistics section following this guide: <br />h-t-t-p-s://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci_app_statistics</p><p>I&#039;ve enabled the collection of data in the Statistics--&gt;Setup section for several plugins, but now if I go to the Statistics --&gt; Graphics section in Luci, I just see 2 tabs : Interfaces and System Load ( which were the 2 that were already enabled in the firmware image I&#039;ve installed ).</p><p>Tip: I just have 2 directories under : /tmp/rrd/RouterName ... those are &quot;load&quot; and &#039;interface-br-lan&#039;...</p><p>Any ideas on how to enable seeing the rest?</p><p>Also, I have added a thumbdrive to my router ( Linksys 1900ACS v2 ) to move the collection files and tmp into it... can anyone send me a link on how to configure moving the collectd files into the thumbdrive so i don&#039;t wear out the router flash memory? I&#039;m not an expert in Linux so I don&#039;t even know which is the mnt point nor the DEV for the usbdrive ... so really detailed instructions will help <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>Regards,<br />Mariano</p>									</div>

					<p>* Make sure that you have installed the collectd-mod-XXX plugins for each of the stats you want<br />* by default the stats are stored in the router RAM, so there is no flashwear (but stats get cleared at every reboot)</p><p>If you have edited settings in LuCI, the stats config should get updated automaticallt, but if you have edited stat config manually, you need to restart the luci_statistics service or reboot he device</p><p>If you do from console &quot;/etc/init.d/luci_statistics restart&quot;, do you get errors in console or in system log?</p><p>Which exact build you are running? Openwrt 15.05.1? Openwrt master? LEDE master (with kernel 4.9?) LEDE 17.01?&nbsp; (I am asking because I found a bug in ubifs+overlayfs in kernel 4.9, and your symptoms might be due to that if you use LEDE master or a private build with kernel 4.9 or above.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 8 Mar 2017, 15:57)</p>

					<p>GREAT!! ALL of the graphs are working now! I&#039;ve deleted the file, and the restart just recreates it the same way ( not sure where it&#039;s pulling all the config from ... the file that&#039;s recreated contains all of my configuration i.e. the sites to ping for the ping plugin, etc)</p><p>This is what&#039;s the restart output looks like:</p><p>root@RouterACS:/etc/config# /etc/init.d/luci_statistics restart<br />configfile: stat (/etc/collectd/conf.d) failed: No such file or directory<br />rrdtool plugin: RRASingle = true: creating only AVERAGE RRAs</p><p>You&#039;re great ,thanks a lot! </p><p>Now to move the datadir ... can you guide me through the process? &quot;move the datadir in Luci stats settings.

					<p>I&#039;ve been collecting these metrics for a few months now - and it seems they get progressively more inaccurate - the longer the timespan collected. e.g. looking at 1 month&nbsp; - I&#039;ve downloaded 350Gb in total - but looking at 1 year - (across 2 months) - I&#039;ve only downloaded 88Gb. Why are the number so inaccurate? How can I make them more accurate?</p>									</div>
