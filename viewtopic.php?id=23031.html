					<p>Be carefull - in the device its high voltage - I don&#039;t take any responsibility when you kill yourself, your dog or your mom - the post is only for information that it is possible to fix it cheaper than 1$&nbsp; <br />When disconnecting the supply wait one hour to discharge all capacitors before open the case<br />And don&#039;t connect the device to the electric socket with open case - and when closing the case use a electrical tape or glue it together</p><p>Reading through the forum I see its a common problem that the power supply breaks<br />You can buy a new one of fix the existing one - its simple<br />The hardest part is to open the case because its glued - but with a knife or screwdriver inserted on the shorter side (where the cable goes out) and use it as a lever its not that hard<br />when you crack open the shorter side then insert&nbsp; it in the middle of one of the longer two and do similar thing</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://kosmetyka.tk/rear.jpeg" alt="http://kosmetyka.tk/rear.jpeg" /></span><br />normally there is one capacitor 1200u 10V soldered to the two pins in red circle - you must look at the polarity - on new capacitors the longer pin is positive (and negative is marked with a white strip on the case)</p><p>I&#039;ve marked with black lines free pins where you can solder the capacitor - depending on the size <br />I have put two capacitors 1000u (bigger is better) 10V and one 10n from the other side (its unnecessary but I had one - its value is not critical - should be between 10 -100 n but it should help to reduce the impedance of the big capacitors)<br />from the other side it should look like this but normally there is a bigger one in the middle<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://kosmetyka.tk/front.jpeg" alt="http://kosmetyka.tk/front.jpeg" /></span><br />have fun</p>									</div>

					<p>Unless you&#039;re extremely comfortable with power electronics and have a spare cap lying around and just can&#039;t help yourself: <strong>don&#039;t</strong>. Switching Power Supplies are pure evil and will blow up in your face if you do something wrong. Do yourself a favor and just get a replacement power brick somewhere off the net, they&#039;re only about 5 Euros/Dollars anyway.</p><p>And yes, I&#039;m speaking from personal experience, and with a 15 years+ background in electronics.</p>									</div>
