					<p>Dear all, <br />I have an alix2d13 on which I would like to install OpenWrt to turn it into a wireless access point (home usage for a few devices). For this I need to buy a wireless card and these are the available ones from the vendor:<br /></p><ul><li><p>dcma81&nbsp; &nbsp; Wistron DCMA81 Atheros 802.11a/b/g miniPCI wireless card - EOL, while supplies last</p></li><li><p>dnma92&nbsp; &nbsp; Wistron DNMA92 Atheros 802.11a/b/g/n miniPCI wireless card (for alix)</p></li><li><p>wlm200nx&nbsp; &nbsp; Compex WLM200NX Atheros 802.11a/b/g/n miniPCI wireless card (for alix)</p></li></ul><p>All actually, or almost EOL.</p><p>Which one do you suggest (is compatible)?<br />Can I install the last OpenWRT release on the alix and is it stable?</p><p>and last is it worth to convert it or not from your point of view or hw is too old?</p><p>Thank you, <br />dk</p>									</div>

					<p>I have an ALIX and am very happy with it.&nbsp; I do not run a wireless card in it, but use a separate &quot;Dumb&quot; AP.&nbsp; </p><p>It&#039;s very unclear in the literature, but you need different cards for each band if you want dual band.&nbsp; While the cards can run either band, they do not do it simultaneously.&nbsp; You have two slots, but the case only two holes. Sure you can use a drill.&nbsp; </p><p>I was also able to locate the router where the cable comes in and put the AP in a much better location for wireless coverage.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your reply.<br />Ok so the last version of OpenWRT works fine. Any suggestion on which wifi card to get?<br />Is it worth to use it only as a &quot;dumb&quot; access point?</p><p>Which version should I copy to the CF and what is the size of it? x86/geode/?</p><p>Thank you,<br />dk</p>									</div>

					<p>@RangerZ: voyage is a stripped down debian. So you can even build/install latest sources using apt. Which was quite handy for me installing MC7710+qmi years ago. As the drivers were/are updated quite regularly :-)<br />As I am more familar with cmd-line LINUX/UNIX, this is the way to go for me, instead GUI. Usually lacking some flexibility.<br />openwrt I consider appropiate for less powerful HW.</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding my question on faster, are you looking for a faster Ethernet ports, faster processing in general or for VPN specifically.&nbsp; </p><p>If you just need a faster LAN, you can just add a GB switch.&nbsp; VPN may be better.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to know.....</p><p>Actually, I do not believe you can run simultaneous dual band on ANY router with these cards or any of the PCI-e cards (for the APU or APU2).&nbsp; Check the forums on this and send a ? to the vendor if that is your expectation.</p><p>If you are thinking of using the APU2 with OpenWrt, then you will probably want to build your own image.&nbsp; See other posts on this.&nbsp; I think LEDs are\were and issue.</p>									</div>
