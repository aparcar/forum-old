					<p>Hi<br />Can someone point me to the right direction or help me with the wireless binary that is compiled for the kernel v2.4.18?</p><p>As i understand the OpenWRT developer team has(had) the same problem with the WRT router.<br />How did you adapt the binary to the new kernel, or the new kernel to the wireless binary?<br />Can someone that solved this problem help me do the same for the IPN2220 binary used in the ADM5120 based routers?<br />Or at least give me some icebraking tips and hints on how to do this the best way, or where to start?</p><p>This would help us greatly in giving <a href="http://www.amilda.org">AMiLDA</a> the wireless support and<br />it would also help all the people that are trying to port OpenWRT to these kinds of routers.</p><p>Thank You</p>									</div>
