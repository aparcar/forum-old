					<p>If it were up to me, I&#039;d start with dime-a-dozen bulletproof hardware and increase capabilities from there.&nbsp; Especially coming into the equation essentially as an unknown, first-time customers are far more likely to spend their marginal cash if the cost of both entry and resultant failure is low.&nbsp; This is why the *wrt distros were so successful, is because the base Linksys (and other) devices were so initially cheap, no one thought twice about bricking a $50 piece of hardware.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>phizaleo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Q1.&nbsp; What do you think, RealTek, Broadcom, other?<br />Q2.&nbsp; Balancing Cost vs Performance, would you prefer a more integrated SoC that contained all functional components with lower cost and lower performance or a higher performance router with separate Switch, Radio and CPU switch at greater cost?</p></blockquote></div><p>I view these as one question, and refer to my above note.&nbsp; I personally would prefer something with integrated ADSL and a switch, but that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; It is my opinion that all the file server, media system, and similar extensions have gotten too far away from the original premise: a purpose-built piece of router hardware with custom firmware.&nbsp; I don&#039;t dislike the additions, but disagree with how much focus they&#039;ve taken off of the basic functionality.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>phizaleo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Q3.&nbsp; We are also looking at providing a USB port.&nbsp; We know that many people in the community like this option (external HDD, Flash Drive, etc).&nbsp; However, not everyone needs this function.&nbsp; Is adding the USB interface desired?</p></blockquote></div><p>Attractive, particularly if a chipset w/integrated ADSL (or Cable for those that swing that way) is not a viable option.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>phizaleo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Q4.&nbsp; WiFi, do we need to support a newer WiFi technology such as 802.11N?&nbsp; Is it worth the uptick in price?

					<p>I recently bought an Asus WL-500-GP, for these reasons:</p><p>- it has 8MB flash (as opposed to only 4 or even less)<br />- it has 32MB ram (as opposed to only 16 or even less)<br />- it&#039;s supported by openwrt</p><p>Several other people I talked to in #openwrt bought the same device for this reason, as well. It&#039;s a very popular router, but apparently it was too expensive in production, at least the new V2 version of this router seems to be dumbed down a lot.</p><p>Regarding your other requirements, please note that I&#039;m not involved in development at all, I&#039;m just a regular user:</p><p>Q1: don&#039;t know. it does not matter much to the end user; the requirement here is: it has to work fine. I understand that the driver situation is not the best for my ASUS router, but it does work (with 2.4 kernel). So minor problems are not necessarily a show stopper as long as it can be supported, at all.</p><p>Q2: I don&#039;t mind a single chip / low cost solution, as long as it works. I never opened my router and I don&#039;t intend to do so in the feature. Although I could replace my wifi minipci card which is apparently in my router, I don&#039;t intend to do so, ever.</p><p>Q3: my router has USB and I never used it. if it can actually be put to some use (download on usb stick, server for usb printers and scanners), that&#039;d be nice to have. But it&#039;s really way down on my personal wishlist.</p><p>Q4: newer wifi technology: none of my other wifi devices support it either, so this would be completely useless</p><p>Q5: no need</p><p>Regarding headers:<br />I&#039;m not interested in boards. If you have to buy a board and a case separately, it&#039;s just too expensive. I prefer a box that comes ready to use.</p><p>If you make a router, that is supported by openwrt and other free firmwares, and that is not tight on resources, and does not have a completely unreasonable high price compared to other products, you should have something that sells.</p>									</div>

This way, this way the router can easily run encryptions. You can sell the router equipped with a 32MB DRAM. If end users want to add more RAM, they can just buy the new RAM from local stores to replace the existing one easily.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 3 May 2008, 02:42)</p>

					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Again thanks for the comments.&nbsp; Each day there is more and more useful information that you are providing.&nbsp; I am going to have a full review with the rest of the team here on Tuesday and will reply with the outcome of that meeting.&nbsp; We will probably have to make some general decisions (single SoC vs multi-chip and which chip manufacturer, WiFi standard, etc)&nbsp; within the next 1 to 2 weeks.&nbsp; How much Flash, RAM, etc can come later to a certain extent.</p><p>This is really going to happen, so if you don&#039;t provide input, don&#039;t complain later! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Have a good weekend,<br />Phiz</p>									</div>

					<p>I like the BCM5354. Integrated solution does not necessarily mean poor performance The 5354 has separate ethernet for lan and wan which adds up to improved performance. I also like the integrated usb 2.0 support. This all argues for lower power consumption for applications like an autonomous robot. 240 MHz to boot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tetelestai</strong> on 6 May 2008, 21:53)</p>

					<p>just throwing few thoughts....</p><p>I think by going for a &quot;one size fits all&quot; will be a real challenge.... I doubt you can or would make anyone happy at the end...<br />Maybe it would be clever to &quot;split the path&quot; and make more (possible) users/customers happy...</p><p>First of all, I think modularity and &quot;openess&quot; is a must. As already suggested, at least make things accessible via pin headers... making the solution modular would allow the users to actually choose what they need and pay accordingly.<br />So, on one side you could have a &quot;small &amp; compact&quot; solution targeted at low price with &quot;not so much horse power&quot; etc.. and a &quot;pro&quot; version with more powerful cpus, maybe with some accelerators, more expandability, more ram...</p><p>Talking about the &quot;little one&quot; I think a SoC solution is the right way to go something integrated as much as possible with &quot;goodies&quot; not available elsewhere:<br />- SoC solution with integrated BG radio, 1 (+1) LAN, serial, usb, ~8MB Flash, ~32MB RAM - but make thinks modular - give out just the &quot;bare minimum&quot; with upgrade options - a nice feature would be a miniPCI/PCIe slot, to be able to upgrade the radio or add other &quot;functionality&quot;, include serial, usb, second lan.. maybe in form of &quot;upgradeable modules&quot; or just leave the pin headers or sell additional &quot;DIY kits&quot; for upgrades</p><p>The &quot;big one&quot; should have a powerfull cpu (IXP4xx, x86...) so various ipsec or other compute-intensive tasks will feel comfortable, add few *real* ethernet ports (maybe some GigE also) more ram (in a sodim?) and more flash, maybe an CF slot... at least 3-4 expansion ports (miniPCI/PCIe) </p><p>This way you could really make people happy. If you could offer all that for a &quot;really reasonable&quot; price... </p><p>The PoE, maybe just the passive one, is very important as I see it. And you can simply make it modular again so users have a choice in terms of price/performance...</p><p>Anyway, best wishes for this project! I really can&#039;t wait to see what will get out of it... if possible, I&#039;m just signing for samples right now.</p><p>Best regards,<br />M.Culibrk</p>									</div>

The benefits on using this approach is the design is freely available and it comes with HD controller + Video port.</p><p>As with firmware, you can have OpenWRT and/or any open-source firmware communities developed it to cut down the costs.
