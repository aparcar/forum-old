					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve downloaded and installed openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3220-v2-squashfs-factory.bin onto the router.<br />But, I have no internet, no web interface.</p><p>I can ping the router on 192.168.1.1, nmap says ports 22 and 53 are open.<br />I was able to login via telnet, set the root password, then login via ssh.</p><p>Now:<br />Is there a way to get a web interface so I can configure the 3G modem?<br />Is there a way to upload another firmware via command line?<br />Is there a way to revert to the old TL firmware?</p><p>This OpenWRT looks nice but so far, it&#039;s a real headache to have it up and running.</p><p>Thank you very much for your pointers.</p>									</div>
