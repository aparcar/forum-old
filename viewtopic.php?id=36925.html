					<p>Hi,</p><p>i&#039;m trying to set up a second wifi network on the same Phy wifi card in WDS mode.</p><p>The first has the WDS option 1 and is bridged to the LAN as usual (192.168.x.y)</p><p>The second i would like to provide for my neighbour as a new LAN (with a different 192.168.x.x), also in WDS mode.</p><br /><p>For some reason i can only join the second unit on the second LAN as a client (dhcp). When i join the first it works perfectly.</p><br /><br /><p>I&#039;ve read some issues on atheros chipsets which would be a disaster as i just changed to both atheros boards (wndr3800 and WR841n.v7).</p><br /><br /><p>Could this be fixed?</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks,</p><p>Martijn</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>godfather007</strong> on 18 May 2012, 12:14)</p>

					<p>I have also noted such problem.<br />Only the first WDS AP can work as WDS-AP..... &quot;the first wifi item in /etc/wireless&quot;<br />But in old builds don&#039;t have such problem.<br />(something older than r314xx)</p>									</div>

					<p>hi, </p><p>do you really need WDS for your neighbour? If he has a different subnet, you could just use routed clientmode (with masquerading or actual routing), there is no advantage in using WDS for this interface. If the neighbour should only have internetaccess and no access to your lan make something like I mentioned here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36689">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36689</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 18 May 2012, 14:39)</p>

But this setup is then going to be a NAT behind NAT solution isn&#039;t it?</p><br /><p>And how to setup the second wifi section then as the first contains: AP + WDS.</p><br /><br /><p>Funny part is when i want to join the second WIFI and do that with a linksys, it works (STA) but the wifi card gets disturbed after a while (like after 5 minutes) and resets everyone.</p>									</div>
