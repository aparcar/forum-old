					<p>I got me a few of these v2&#039;s too last week. I was somewhat disappointed after I opened the box en especially because there was no AA-firmware available. <br />However, the trunk version works well.

					<p>Okay, here we go.</p><p>I suppose you know how to telnet and to use ssh. Starting-point is an original TP-Link TL-WR1043ND Ver2.1 and you get into its webinterface.<br />Get the trunk version of OpenWrt from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/</a>&nbsp; called&nbsp; openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v2-squashfs-factory.bin<br />Flash your router using this file. After a while the device reboots. The router is now on 192.168.1.1 . Make sure that your PC gets a new dhcp-lease or at least make it able to communicate to the router. Also have the router connected to the Internet to let it download additional packages.</p><p>Now for initial purposes you are able to telnet to the device and even get in without using a password:<br />telnet 192.168.1.1</p><p>First thing might be setting a new password:<br />passwd</p><p>While you are still connected install the packages you need. Probably it&#039;s only Luci that you miss. I like the ip-package as well:<br />opkg update <br />opkg install luci ip</p><p>To be able to use the webinterface we need to start the http-server:<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start</p><p>Now you can continue configuring by using the webinterface the way you were used to. However, the GUI is changed and you see a lot of IPv6-stuff that you did not see in the AA-releases.</p><p>Take care of the fact that you are using a development-version and things might change over night. I noticed this when I experienced package incompatibilities when I wanted to add a package a few weeks after flashing. I had to update to the current trunk version (using ...sysupgrade.bin) to install what I wanted (and I had to reinstall the additional packages).</p><p>One big difference between this version 2.1 and the previous (white-case) model is the ethernet-switching. From what I understand, the old one had only one ethernetport (eth0) connected to the switch-silicon. Separation between WAN and LAN was done by VLAN-tagging. The new one seems to have an eth0 and eth1, both connected to a VLAN-switch.<br />I drew a sketch of how I think the CPU and the Swich-chip are interconnected and defined by default BB:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://mlf.home.xs4all.nl/openwrt/TPL1043v2_swich_diagram_sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketch_Switch1043v2 bbcode test" /></span></p><p>The default config does not make use of VLANs but it can be done if you need this (like I do very much). Its GUI just is not as clear as it should. Here is a part of the graphical config of the switch in which I wrote the denotiations that corespond with the labels on the outside to make it more clear.</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://mlf.home.xs4all.nl/openwrt/TPL1043v2_luci-switchconfig_edit3.png" alt="GUI_Switch1043v2 bbcode test" /></span></p><br /><p>One hint on adding vlan&#039;s that might save you lots of frustration: If you add a new vlan, it is presented as an eth0.xx in the GUI. So, if you choose this one when you add a new interface this is mostly not the one you meant as eth0 is used as WAN-port by default.<br />Under the interfaces Physical Settings, don&#039;t select the new pre-defined vlan but just fill in the Custom Interface&nbsp; eth1.xx</p><br /><p>As I&#039;m not an OpenWrt-guru, please post your comments and corrections to this topic and I will add them to this post. Also, maybe someone might add this to the 1043&#039;s wiki-page.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Erik</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Zanzani</strong> on 24 Feb 2014, 00:59)</p>

					<p>I have a tp-link wr1043nd v2.1, and am using a macbook pro with mac os x and version 10.9.1. <br />I followed the instructions on: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a> </p><p>Specifically: <br />a) Hard reset 30-30-30 <br />b) flash <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr1043nd-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ â€¦ actory.bin</a> <br />c) reset <br />d) hard reset 30-30-30 </p><p>After doing this, the router does not respond via firefox or safari at 192.168.1.1. </p><p>So I went searching and found this forum chain, specifically FriedZombie&#039;s comment &quot;the Trunk images don&#039;t include a WebGui (luci) by default, but you can install it of course. <br />This also means that you initially have to use the cli&quot; </p><br /><p>So I went to the command line.

					<p>Hello Arincm,</p><p>After flashing you should be able to access the device using telnet. At least as long as you do not set a password.

Only your current connection keeps up until you end it.</p><p>As you tell us that you able to ssh to the device on 192.168.1.1 I&#039;m sure that you are on the LAN-side (access from WAN is blocked by the firewall for all services).<br />Just to make sure that your telnet client-program is working, try telnetting to the ssh-port by:<br />telnet 192.168.1.1 22</p><p>You should at least see something like this:<br />SSH-2.0-dropbear_2013.59</p><p>A serial cable is always a good idea if you&#039;re in to OpenWrt.

					<p>Hi Risa2000,</p><p>It&#039;s just experience, I did no research on this. But I just tested the procedure on some other TP-link router. I found out that the telnetd is still running after setting the root-password but it refuses to get connected the next time you try. You get disconnected immediately. No chance of entering a username:</p><p>$ telnet 192.168.1.1<br />Trying 192.168.1.1...<br />Connected to 192.168.1.1.<br />Escape character is &#039;^]&#039;.<br />Login failed.<br />Connection closed by foreign host.</p><p>About the authorized_key-login: I know about it but I&#039;ve never used it.
