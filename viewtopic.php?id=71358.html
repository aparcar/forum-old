					<p>Routed client.&nbsp; You have to route (not bridge) to a public hotspot (or any other ordinary AP) because it can serve only one user MAC address at the STA end. </p><p>There is a wiki page about this but it makes it unnecessarily complicated.&nbsp; Start with a default configuration.&nbsp; Create a STA (aka client) mode wifi interface that will connect to the hotspot.&nbsp; Put it in the WAN network.&nbsp; Check the WAN physical settings to be sure it is NOT a bridge and it only has your STA in it.&nbsp; (Any WAN ethernets can be moved to LAN to have more ports)&nbsp; By default, WAN should be a DHCP client, so it will get an IP automatically from the hotspot.&nbsp; If this IP is 192.168.1.X, it will conflict with the LAN, so you need to set the LAN to a different IP range.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 28 Jun 2017, 02:08)</p>

					<p>You can not post links until you become a bit more trusted.&nbsp; Not sure what the number is but it&#039;s probably 10-12.</p><p>I can not find your link by replacing dot with&quot;.&quot;.
