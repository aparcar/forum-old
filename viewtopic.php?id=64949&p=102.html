In that case, both packages can be safely removed, but kmod-mwifiex-sdio should definitely be removed.

Actually the mwifiex driver (kmod-mwifiex-sdio) makes the router non-FCC compliant because it doesn&#039;t use the country code built into eeprom and allows the country code and therefore the power tables of radio2 to be changed if it is used as an AP.</p><p>A new pull request should be made to LEDE to revert the addition of these 2 packages made by the pull request @david linked to which causes both of the mwifiex packages to be included in the official 3200acm LEDE builds.&nbsp; Because athough @david can remove the packages from his builds, they shouldn&#039;t be included in any builds.</p><p>Edit:. After thinking about it more, I still feel mwifiex-sdio-firmware should stay included, just to be on the safe side. As I said before, it definitely won&#039;t cause any harm. Only kmod-mwifiex-sdio needs to be removed.&nbsp; </p><p>Edit2:&nbsp; Addition to Edit1: <span class="bbu">My reason for thinking this is unlike the kmod-mwlwifi driver which includes the driver AND firmware; mwifiex has it&#039;s firmware in a separate package than the driver.&nbsp; So it (the mwifiex firmware, mwifiex-sdio-firmware package) may be able to load itself in the background or have other packages use it without the additional driver package, and if so, it would be being used for DFS...</span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 7 Jul 2017, 00:46)</p>

Yesterday evening I removed both packages and rebooted then selected a DFS channel. Within an hour the channel was changed to a non DFS channel.
