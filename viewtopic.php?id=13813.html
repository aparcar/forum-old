					<p>I am just wondering what are the benefits of using open-source-router or RB532 with Kamikaze<br />while you can buy off-the-shelf router for cheaper price ? What this combo does differently ?</p><p>thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>While there are some off the shelf routers that support traffic shaping, it is usually not possible to design your own custom shaping setup. In Linux you can choose from several different schedulers and behaviours (hsfc, htb, sfq, prio, red, ...) and combine them in any way you want. I&#039;m using a HTB (one class per user) -&gt; PRIO (prioritization depending on type of bandwidth) -&gt; SFQ (balance concurrent connections) approach to ensure fair bandwidth sharing and quality of service. Off the shelf routers do it differently i.e. not the way I want. With off the shelf routers you&#039;re stuck with whatever feature set and flavor they offer; with Linux you can create your own flavor. Also, a router you can put OpenWRT on, is not more expensive than the 3com you mentioned... that 3com you mentioned is actually more expensive than a WRT54GL here.</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess most people here install openwrt on off-the-shelf-routers<br />Take a look at the supported devices, many consumer-routers&nbsp; are supported. </p><p>and also take a look at the package-directory an you will get an impression what you can do with openwrt <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/packages/mips/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/packages/mips/</a><br />and if you need something else you can compile it yourself <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> so I guess you can do almost everything.</p><p>so tell me which 50$ router with stock-firmware has this options?</p><p>and I guess many people like openwrt because itÂ´s modular, you only need to install the packages you want, so you get a slim system if you donÂ´t need special functions, and you donÂ´t waste (flash-)space for things you donÂ´t need (and have more space left for the things you want to use).&nbsp; </p><p>For example I run a openvpn-server on a &quot;cheap router&quot;. If you want a vpn-server out of the box you have to spend 200 euros and more. <br />Another router has an usb-harddrive attached and run a nfs-server on it.</p><p>and I guess the advantage of board-based routers over consumer-routers is, that this hardware is modular, too. You can decide which wifi-card you want to use, antennas, maybe the amount of ram, or whatever.</p>									</div>
