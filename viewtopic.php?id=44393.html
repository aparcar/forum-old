					<p>there is no point in doing this on the AP-side. <br />Initiating roaming to another AP only makes sense if you know that there is a better signal to/from the another AP.<br />Disconnecting a client just because it has a &quot;weak&quot; signal doesn&#039;t make sense, what if this weak signal is the strongest signal the client gets? <br />So the logic and decision should be in the client, and it should change the station because the other signal is better/stronger, not because the current signal is weak.&nbsp; The only thing that the APs should do, is make the roaming, fast and without or only little interruption.</p>									</div>
