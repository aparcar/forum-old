					<p>Hi, I was wondering if someone can possibly give me some advice.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get my Xbox One (with static ip) working fully with my Openwrt router.</p><p>The problem I have is that I can not get the NAT of the XBox on to open.</p><p>I have tried using traffic rules to open the ports needed, it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>I have tried port forwarding, it also didn&#039;t work.</p><p>And I have tried UPNP and it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>I know it&#039;s not the connection it&#039;s self as when I use the router provided by my ISP everything is fine, but on Openwrt, I just can&#039;t get it working.</p><p>I was wondering if there is anyway of putting the ip in a DMZ for it to work?</p><p>Failing that, has any one got any other ideas how to solve this?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you please elaborate on the topology of the devices?&nbsp; I ask because if you NAT at the ISP router and again at the OpenWRT router, it is likely that no amount of tinkering at the OpenWRT side will get it to work.</p><p>UPnP is the correct tool to use for this, but it will only work if there is one &quot;layer&quot; of NAT&#039;ing.</p><p>First prize would be to NAT only at the OpenWRT router.&nbsp; If you have config-level access to your ISP router, you should investigate whether it uses PPPoE (it likely does) and whether you can set it to bridge mode and initiate the PPPoE connection from the OpenWRT router instead.&nbsp; That would require the username/password for the PPPoE session; some ISPs that supply pre-configured routers don&#039;t make that information available.</p>									</div>
