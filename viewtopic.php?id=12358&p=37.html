					<p>I did. And it is not like wireless is becoming unstable over time requiring a restart. It just restarts after what no client can connect to it. Daily restarts will not do much good either, because sometimes this happens 3 or 4 times in one hour. And 40MHz channel is slow all the time. I can switch to &quot;g&quot; only mode to see if that works, but then there is no point in having an &quot;N&quot; capable router and clients. I just hope this can be fixed in future versions.</p>									</div>
