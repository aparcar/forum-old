					<p>Hello,</p><p>Computer:<br />Asus<br />Processor Intel i7<br />Ubuntu 16.04, 64bit</p><p>Router:<br />WRT54GL<br />Luci</p><p>Background (skip this if desired, issue at bottom)-<br />Attempted to create a man in the middle packet sniffer with the router; want to analyze packets of smartphone apps on a test phone. Installed tcpdump-mini and libpcap on the router.&nbsp; Everything functioned as it should, EXCEPT, my tcpdump filters were not working. No syntax errors, but they were not affecting capture.&nbsp; More detailed background, I&#039;m SSH into the router to run tcpdump, and CAT&#039;ing the output file from router onto my local Ubuntu machine (router has little memory, can&#039;t write local).</p><p>As you may know, this had TCPDUMP sniffing my SSH traffic, which snowballs as every packet sent is then captured, and tcpdump essentially captures on itself; and traffic grows exponentially. None of my filters to ignore my SSH would work (not port, not host, etc. etc.).&nbsp; Eventually, I googled the right terms and found that TCPDUMP gets wonky with VLAN traffic, as it moves bits around int he header.&nbsp; I added the &quot;not vlan&quot; command to my tcpdump filter and all the traffic was filtered; SUCCESS!&nbsp; Not quite, i still had issues getting the syntax right to make tcpdump understand that traffic was vlan, but also apply my port filters.</p><br /><p>**Bottom line- my dumbass thought it would be simple to just go into OpenWRT and disable vlan stuff to make life easy.&nbsp; After hitting apply, I&#039;ve been unable to talk with the router.&nbsp; I did the failsafe restart, and this enables me to PING successfully (to 192.168.1.1), but no longer allows me to SSH in command line (connection refused) or to access OpenWRT through web-browser (firefox).&nbsp; When not in failsafe mode, the ethernet connection never establishes, and even PING is unsuccessful.</p><p>Again, the system worked great for a while, I disabled vlan on all ports (dumb), and now cannot SSH.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>paddy1337</strong> on 10 Aug 2017, 17:06)</p>
