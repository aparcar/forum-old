					<p>I need to use the pwc (Philips webcam) module.</p><p>I see it enabled as &quot;M&quot; (build as module) in both make menuconfig and make config in the stock svn-trunk download.&nbsp; But it doesn&#039;t build.</p><p>I&#039;m building for the brcm47xx-2.6 target, and in the config file there, the PWC option CONFIG_USB_PWC=m isn&#039;t in there; in fact none of the USB options for CONFIG_USB_HID are there.</p><p>So my question is: is there a problem that this package is enabled but doesn&#039;t build?</p><p>How can I regenerate the config file for a given target architecture?</p><p>I&#039;ve read and read, but can&#039;t quite get my head around how this ought to work.</p>									</div>
