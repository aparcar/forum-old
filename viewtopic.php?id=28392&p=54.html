					<p>Weird, so I just updated to latest CC for my proper router WNDR3700. The LuCi GUI is going crazy slow and times out. I restarted router several times, reset to defaults with pushing the pin for 15 seconds. It goes so slow then times out, especially when trying to edit LAN settings.</p><p>Should I update back to the one I came from to see if it fixes it? Safe to downgrade to older version? I don&#039;t want to risk a brick.</p><p>Edit: I restarted computer and deleted cache. Timeout part is fixed. However, annoying bug. Every time I try to go to a different menu under System, such as Startup or System. It takes me to the &quot;Authorization Required&quot; screen and requires me to login then takes me back to the main Status screen after successful login.</p><p>After doing it 3-4 times, it finally goes to the page I am trying to visit. Anyone else having this bizarre issue?</p><p>Even to have default password to change it finally stuck after 5-6 times. Perhaps I should go to latest trunk instead of this CC? I have always used Trunk in past with no crazy issues like this.</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ZzBloopzZ</strong> on 25 Sep 2015, 09:21)</p>

					<p>r47073: build environment: scripts modified, support both git and svn as the main repo</p><p>The changes have no impact for &quot;end-users&quot; of my firmware, instead they have implications to people cloning my build environment (explanation in message #2 of this thread).</p><p>I have edited the build scripts in a major way, and here is a short explanation about the changes.</p><p>I have noticed that GIT is steadily getting more popular as the preferred cvs platform. I still use SVN for the Openwrt main sources, and the Openwrt repo itself and bug tracker are still SVN based. But in any case, the new build scripts support either SVN or GIT as the cvs platform. You can select one of them in the &quot;buildroot creation&quot; script.</p><p><strong>Main changes:</strong><br />* All build scripts are now in &lt;buildroot&gt;/hnscripts instead of &lt;buildroot&gt;, and the scripts are included in the -openwrt.patch<br />* New buildroot creation script is packaged separately and has been clarified. <br />* User can select to use either GIT or SVN as the main Openwrt repo format when creating a new build environment. (I have tested both going from SVN to GIT repo and from GIT back to a new SVN environment.)<br />* Buildscripts have been edited to support both SVN and GIT as the main repo.<br />* Explicit requirement for /Openwrt as the base has been removed. The build environment can now be created anywhere (as long as the path stays reasonably short).<br />* The log file &quot;build.log&quot; has been moved to &lt;buildroot&gt;/logs.</p><p><strong>Differences between SVN and GIT versions:</strong><br />- My SVN version continues to use the last check-in in any repo as the version, while GIT uses explicitly the default Openwrt logic about last check-in that has affected this branch (trunk or chaos). E.g. currently the SVN chaos build says r47073 while GIT version would say r47072 (as 47073 did not affecto chaos branch). (As feeds evolve separately, I prefer to set the version as recent as possible, but with GIT there is no possibility for that logic.)<br />- GIT build is also partially hurt by the default .gitignore, where &lt;buildroot&gt;/files has been excluded from version control. My build has files there, so I may edit the default .gitignore in near future. I understand the exclusion logic for the core Openwrt developers, for treating that folder normally eases things for people building private builds.<br />- Both versions will create an otherwise identical &quot;release package&quot;, but the -status.txt and the -openwrt.patch files have small format differences due to GIT/SVN differences. &quot;Release packages&quot; created in either cvs are compatible and can be used to create either build environment the next time.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> if you have an existing copy of my build system and you want the new scripts, it is possible to copy the new scripts into your old repo (to &lt;buildroot&gt;/hnscripts directory), as the build system structure has not changed otherwise. You can probably get the new scripts easiest by grabbing the most recent release (r47073 or newer) from Dropbox and either<br />- use the new creation script to create a surplus copy of the build system to a new location and then manually copy the new scripts to your old build environment, or<br />- copy the -openwrt.patch from the newest release and edit that to extract just the new scripts.<br />In either case, add the new scripts to svn/git version control to preserve them properly.</p>									</div>

					<p>- r47244: Note: Material theme seems to be broken</p><p>There have been changes in the Luci URL handling in the past two days. The security token (like stok=571709a6dee935b0ffff3175a8c08634) has been removed from the URLs. The change has caused some trouble with e.g. login and flashing, but the known problems in the Luci itself have been fixed.<br />(See e.g. <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/luci/issues/516">https://github.com/openwrt/luci/issues/516</a> )</p><p>One known thing is that the Material theme seems to be negatively affected by the change. The left-side menu is missing and some pages are scrambled. So, if you use that theme, be aware of the possible issues.</p><p>EDIT:<br />Regarding Material theme:<br />The issue is apparently using the existence of &quot;;&quot; in the URL to sniff if the user is logged in or still at the login screen. In the new scheme there is no &quot;;&quot; in the URL, so Material gets it wrong.</p><p>I made a small patch in a live router to /www/luci-static/material/js/script.js . I eliminated the sniffing for &quot;;&quot;. This works for me otherwise ok, but there is an empty left menu visible at the login screen:</p><p>My interim fix is included in the r47245 build.</p><p>EDIT2:<br />The theme has been fixed by the author.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 27 Oct 2015, 17:57)</p>

					<p>- r47486: enable sha256 certs in Luci by switching to default SSL implementation (polarssl)</p><p>I switched both trunk and CC15.05 builds to use the default SSL implementation (polarssl) in Luci. Earlier I have saved a few kB by using px5g-standalone for the Luci/uhttpd certificate creation, as all other software other components except px5g have been able to use openssl based SSL library, which is included anyway due to vsftpd-ssl. </p><p>But the SHA1 deprecation (see below) is progressing and so far only the px5g (with libpolarssl) in trunk has been patched to generate SHA256 certificates. Patching px5g-standalone would require more work, and has not been done so far. So I sacrificed a few kB and switched my builds to use px5g, which is the standard Openwrt way. The SHA256 fix has been backported to my CC15.05 build.</p><p>Background for the SHA1--&gt;SHA256 change is that major browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome) will soon actively mark the sites with SHA1 certificates with various security errors.</p><p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/11/04/sha-1-deprecation-update/">https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/201 … on-update/</a><br /><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/10/20/continuing-to-phase-out-sha-1-certificates/">https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/ … tificates/</a><br /><a href="https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/gradually-sunsetting-sha-1.html">https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.c … sha-1.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I know about cake. To my knowledge, it is not yet the the mainstream kernel, but instead it is still under development. The cake package should thus be manually included.
