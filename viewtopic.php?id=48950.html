					<p>Here is many ways howto do this. You can create simple script to detect tun interface and power on led. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

INTERVAL=5
LED=&quot;tplink:green:usb&quot;
LEDWORK=0

while sleep $INTERVAL
do
        if ifconfig | grep -q tun0 ; then
                if [ $LEDWORK -eq 0 ]; then
                        echo &#039;255&#039; &gt; /sys/class/leds/$LED/brightness
                        LEDWORK=1
                fi
        else
                if [ $LEDWORK -eq 1 ]; then
                        echo &#039;0&#039; &gt; /sys/class/leds/$LED/brightness
                        LEDWORK=0
                fi
        fi
done;</code></pre></div><p> or you can add script to /etc/hotplug.d/iface/ folder </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ ifup = &quot;$ACTION&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$INTERFACE&quot; = &quot;tun0&quot; ] &amp;&amp; {
   echo &#039;255&#039; &gt; /sys/class/leds/tplink:green:usb/brightness
    }
[ ifdown = &quot;$ACTION&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$INTERFACE&quot; = &quot;tun0&quot; ] &amp;&amp; {
  echo &#039;0&#039; &gt; /sys/class/leds/tplink:green:usb/brightness
  }</code></pre></div><p> or change OpenVPN script.</p>									</div>

					<p>In my opinion the best way to use is using /etc/config/system:</p><p>For my router a Netgear WNDR3700 v1 I have to add another led section to /etc/config/system. I use the WPS LED since I have no use for WPS on this router:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config led
    option default &#039;0&#039;
    option name &#039;OpenVPN (status)&#039;
    option sysfs &#039;netgear:orange:wps&#039;
    option trigger &#039;netdev&#039;
    option dev &#039;tun0&#039;
    option mode &#039;link&#039;</code></pre></div><p>You basically just have to change the sysfs option to (tplink:green:usb) to point to the LED you like to use for the OpenVPN link status and run &#039;/etc/init.d/led restart&#039; or in LuCI hit &#039;Save &amp; Apply&#039; button and you are done.</p><p>Many ways lead to Rome in OpenWrt....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>written_direcon</strong> on 14 Feb 2014, 15:53)</p>

					<p>NB: This LED configuration does <em>not</em> indicate the state of the OpenVPN connection, only the existence of the tun interface. This becomes especially useless if you use persist-tun (e.g. if you drop root for OpenVPN) because then, the device always has &quot;link&quot;.</p><p>In order to get the state of the OpenVPN client, you&#039;d have to use <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> scripts.

(once it restarts LED stays off all the time until i run that command).. or like you said do you know how to script those with privilege?</p>									</div>
