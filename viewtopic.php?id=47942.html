					<p>Hi, I&#039;d like stay hidden as there is no one on the ip active (pass grc shields up true stealth test - be green). How can I configure /etc/config/firewall to ignore incoming requests (port scans etc)? By defeault openwrt is configured to actively reject requests on closed ports. To block icmp is easy, but how to pass the stealth test? Thank you.</p><p><em>if you have not heard - shields up it here: <a href="https://grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2">https://grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2</a></em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 20 Dec 2013, 00:47)</p>
