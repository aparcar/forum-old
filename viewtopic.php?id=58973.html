					<p>With that kind of attitude, there is a strong possibility they don&#039;t design their own hardware, but rather copy from other manufacturers who own the copyrights. Perhaps, it is time to boycott this company. For instance, on our OpenWRT Makefile for the packages, include the following statement after the OpenWRT copyright statements:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>##########
In view of the response from Ana Ling of Shenzhen Four Seas Global Link Network Technology Co., Ltd. as shown in this post (https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=58973) that clearly indicates a violation of CopyRight licenses from GPL and/or OpenWRT, we hereby declare to boycott Shenzhen Four Seas Global Link Network Technology Co.

We reserve our rights to follow up this violation with a law suite.

					<p>I&#039;ve been doing most testing on the WR650AC.&nbsp; Its a dual band gigabit router.&nbsp; Getting a strange problem now with the internal switch on this device, possibly someone here might be able to shed some light on it.</p><p>Chipset is QCA9558/QCA9880 and switch is a 7 port QCA8337N<br />Port0 (CPU) goes to eth0 and port6 goes to eth1.<br />Default switch config provided by comfast is as follows:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;1&#039;
        option ports &#039;0 2 3 4 5&#039;

config switch_vlan
        option device &#039;switch0&#039;
        option vlan &#039;2&#039;
        option ports &#039;1 6&#039;</code></pre></div><p>However with the ath9k kmod driver installed, Port0 (CPU) stops working and hence LAN ports do not work.&nbsp; The interfaces br-lan and eth0 still show using ifconfig.&nbsp; Port6 still works and so does eth1 (wan).</p><p>As a work around I enabled tagging on port6 back to the CPU for lan/wan and left port0 off.&nbsp; If I disable the ath9k driver in make menuconfig, port0 (CPU) works no problem, but then there is no wifi on 2.4g. I also discarded the proprietary QCA drivers, never imported them to the buildroot so they are not the cause.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Edit:<br />Got this fixed now, had to do a mac swap on the 8337 switch, port0 and port 6.</p><p>Added to machine file:<br />.mac06_exchange_en = true,</p><p>Documented here:<br /><a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2015-April/032798.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/ope … 32798.html</a></p><p>The kernel panic I described earlier was due to the comfast provided patch trying to disable JTAG using:<br />ath79_gpio_function_setup(AR934X_GPIO_FUNC_JTAG_DISABLE, 0);</p><p>and there is also a Pericom PT7A7514 on the pcb which is used by the watchdog</p><p>So it looks like their patch may have been against a slightly different board of the same model.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chessman</strong> on 21 Apr 2016, 14:31)</p>
