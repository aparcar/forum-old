					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to set up Vlans on my WL-HDD and use an external VLAN-capable switch to break out the interfaces as separate ports<br />The end result would be configured like this:<br />vlan0 - lan - switch ports 1-15<br />vlan1 - wan - switch port 16</p><p>I&#039;m running Whiterussian 0.9 Squashfs.</p><p>The WL-HDD has eth1 connected to the outside world as it&#039;s wired LAN port, eth2 as the wireless and eth0 goes nowhere.</p><p>Configuring vlan0 via nvram variables doesn&#039;t seem to work as vlan0 gets associated with eth0 even if I specify:<br />vlan0hwname=et1<br />I can prove this - if I do &quot;ifconfig eth0 down&quot;, vlan0 dissapears.</p><p>So I configured vlan0 manually:<br />vconfig add eth1 0<br />ifconfig vlan0 192.168.1.1/24</p><p>even with this config, I still can&#039;t ping 192.168.1.1 from the outside world.&nbsp; If I connect my laptop directly to the WLHDD I should think that I should be able to ping 192.168.1.1 from it because there is no switch in between to interpret vlan tags and thereby deny access to vlan0.</p><p>I think I made this work with an older version of WhiteRussian, but now I can&#039;t get it to work at all.</p><p>Has anyone else tried anything like this?</p>									</div>
