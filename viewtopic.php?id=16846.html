					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve got an old Linksys BEFSX41 v2 at home and I have no actual use for it so I thought I&#039;d play with it a little.<br />I&#039;d like to get OpenWRT running on it. I&#039;ve read a little about it and I think the only other system that would work on it is OpenWRT but I have absolute no idea on where to start or even if it is really possible.</p><p>Can anyone help me with this.</p><p>Bye</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not possible, it only has 2MB flash and 8MB RAM. OpenWRT needs at least 4MB flash and 16MB RAM to run.</p><p>You might be able to get it running if you find bigger flash and RAM chips that you can solder on.</p><p>See <a href="http://befsx41.flogator.org/doku.php?id=hardware#overview">http://befsx41.flogator.org/doku.php?id â€¦ e#overview</a></p>									</div>
