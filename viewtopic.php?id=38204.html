					<p>Am just having to actually begin configuring IPv6 to make openWRT units communicate.&nbsp; Until now it was just an interest of what IPv6 was.</p><p>Now Im trying to make 2 units talk on ipv6 wirelessly, was not successful and wanted to ask what the basics are?&nbsp; I did search for this answer for a couple days before posting.</p><p>In IPv4, i expect to set an IP statically to some device, save, reinitialize and dont have to look back.&nbsp; The address is there.&nbsp; But so far using IPv6 what it &quot;seems like&quot; is the ipv6 address entry using:&nbsp; &nbsp; ip -6 addr add fc01::3135&nbsp; &nbsp;and it shows up on ifconfig, but using&nbsp; &nbsp;ip -6 neigh show&nbsp; this address is sometimes there, often not.&nbsp; </p><p>The ipv6 settings were predefined by someone else, who has asserted they are correct. I was given instructions to setup and send/receive pings (in ipv6).&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to make the ping6 work i can run the steps from a fresh reboot and it works.&nbsp; using ip -6 neigh show&nbsp; it shows the other ipv6 as REACHABLE.&nbsp; stop the ping6 then show again, it says STALE and again? there is no entry.</p><p>The goal is to take 2 openwrt units running backfire 10.03 to make a solid connection over the radio, dev wlan0 (on each one) IPv6 so that the connection is resilient.&nbsp; Im hoping to apply a custom made program to handle the stream.&nbsp; &nbsp; But am very new to IPv6 settings and may be applying IPv4 rules and its not working.&nbsp; any help is greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>This *MIGHT* be similar to what I&#039;m trying to do and having problems as well:</p><p>Personal Message (Online)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />RADVD through OpenWRT or DDWRT WDS bridge?<br />« on: July 21, 2012, 01:16:12 pm »<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply with quoteQuote Modify messageModify Remove messageRemove<br />Hello IPv6ers,</p><p>I am trying to set up a wireless WDS bridge (maybe not correct terminology) with either two Linksys WRT54GL boxes or two DLINK DIR-825 boxes which will allow IPv6 RADVD to be sent across the bridge to the far end so that clients (either wireless or wired) on the far end can receive the RADVD packets and configure themselves for IPv6 operation.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>HE &lt;-&gt; Internet &lt;-&gt; ISP &lt;-&gt; Cable Modem &lt;- wired link -&gt; Vyatta IPv4/IPv6 configured with RADVD server &lt;- wired-link -&gt; DDWRT/OpenWRT WDS #1 &lt;- wireLESS ONLY link -&gt; DDWRT/OpenWRT WDS #2 &lt;- wired or wireLESS link -&gt; OSX Lion 10.7 laptop</p><p>I&#039;ve read about all the different wireless modes and have seen people claim that WDS is the way to go to act the most like a wired bridged (but using wireless) even though it halves the throughput.</p><p>I value correct operation over speed so this is fine with me.</p><p>However, I&#039;m seemingly not getting the RADVD packets from the Vyatta router through to the far side.&nbsp; When I connect directly in to the Vyatta then it works fine, my MacBookPro gets its IPv6 address.&nbsp; However when I go through the wireless bridge (which works fine for IPv4) I&#039;m not receiving IPv6 RADVD and it is not assigning the IPv6 address on the MacBookPro.</p><p>I thought I had this working the other night but when I came back to it a couple of days later it is either no longer working or the other night I was not testing what I thought I was testing.</p><p>The Firewalls on the DLINK or Linksys boxes have all been turned off.&nbsp; They are all set for the same network as the Vyatta router so it should be acting merely as a wired bridge but using wirless instead.&nbsp; I&#039;ve now tried DDWRT v24-SP2 (10-10-09) and OpenWRT 10.03.1 both in Wireless WDS mode with the same results.</p><p>IPv4 works great and IPv6 works great when connected anywhere else other than through the wireless bridge.</p><p>The other interesting thing is that if I set a manual IPv6 address on the far side, that works fine.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t get RADVD (maybe other types of IPv6 packets? Don&#039;t know) to traverse the wireless bridge.</p><p>I&#039;m stumped.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any ideas as to what I&#039;m doing wrong?</p><p>Is more information needed or is this sufficient to figure out what is going on and whether this would/should work properly?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Thanks in Advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Regarding permanent ipv6 addresses:<br />You can just fine assign permanent ipv6 addresses for the interfaces in Openwrt&#039;s netowrk interface config sections. But I would recommend you to use new trunk instead of Backfire 10.03.1, as the ipv6 support has improved quite a lot since original 10.03 was published over 2 years ago. By default, Backfire has ipv6 routing support disabled. (See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6#routing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6#routing</a> and edit sysctl.conf)</p><p>That fc01::3135 looks a bit strange. It is from the local address space fc00:: , which addresses are not routable ipv6 addresses. They only work inside the local network. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address</a></p><p>If your goal is only to provide internal traffic with no outside connectivity, using that address might be ok. But if you want to surt internet using ipv6, that address will not work. You will need a proper routable public ipv6 address.</p><p>All currently used normal global routable ipv6 addresses start with 20xx::&nbsp; (e.g. 2001::). Have you been assigned a /64 address space by your ISP?</p><p>-----<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>davidwaynesummers wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Any ideas as to what I&#039;m doing wrong?</p></blockquote></div><p>Hijacking a thread with a different subject and doubleposting your own message.</p>									</div>
