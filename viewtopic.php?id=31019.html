					<p>Hi folks</p><p>This is my first post here and i tried to manage everything about openwrt alone so far. But now i have a problem i can not solve on my own.<br />My router is a TPLINK WR1043ND. I managed to install Openwrt on the router and after that i created a rollover on an external Usb stick.<br />This works fine and there are no problems with this. After that i made this USB Mod <a href="http://amichalec.net/2011/03/wr1043nd-usb-mod/">http://amichalec.net/2011/03/wr1043nd-usb-mod/</a> and even this works like a charme,<br />My Problem is that i can boot the Router with my usb stick as rollover&nbsp; but only if i have no other usb device pluged. When i plug in my usb hdd and boot it with both usb devices<br />it creates a /etc folder on my external harddrive and boots from the internal flash. But the Softwaremanager in Luci shows the size of my usb harddisc.</p><p>I think it boots my harddisc that is normaly sdb in the case that it is conected to the router as sda but i have no idea how to chance this.<br />When i disconnect the usb harddrive and reboot it boots again the rollover on the usb stick.<br />Does anyone know this problem and can help me?</p><p>i am afraid that my English is a little bit rusty, so please excuse this</p>									</div>
