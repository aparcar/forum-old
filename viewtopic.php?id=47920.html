					<p>Hi,</p><p>I installed Polycom RealPresence v3 on my computer.&nbsp; My computer has a static IP.&nbsp; I read the Polycom documentation and setup port forwarding for the appropriate ports to the IP of the computer.&nbsp; I then tried to make a call from my smartphone and the connection establishes but I can&#039;t answer the call.&nbsp; I called Polycom and after a remote support session they said all of my settings are correct.&nbsp; If I connect the computer directly to the Internet the call completes like it should.&nbsp; Polycom had me do a wireshark packet capture for a test call and according to polycom the source ip address is 10.18.100.65.&nbsp; The IP of the computer is 192.168.33.2.&nbsp; I can provide the packet captures from my side and polycom&#039;s side.&nbsp; The first router I tried was a Linksys WRT300n v1 router with AA installed.&nbsp; I tried installing a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH2 with DD-WRT Professional installed.&nbsp; It has the exact same problem.&nbsp; I tried a third router a Netgear WNDR4300 running stock firmware and everything works great.&nbsp; From the openwrt wiki I see the WNDR4300 is running a modified version of OpenWrt Kamikaze (bleeding-edge, r18571).&nbsp; I would really like to get this issue fixed in AA and BB so what information do you need from me?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>routerguy</strong> on 19 Dec 2013, 03:19)</p>
