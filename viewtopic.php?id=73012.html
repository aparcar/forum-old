					<p>Hi guys. I’ve searched around a bit but can’t quite find what I’m looking for. Close but not exactly.</p><p>Goal: Internet via Wireless (NO repeating; Client Only)<br />Hardware: Linksys EA4500</p><p>Currently I have a setup like this running on a Linksys E1200 (DD-WRT). With that I just go into wireless settings, select client mode then apply.&nbsp; It uses that as the routers wan connection. I’m finding it hard to replicate this on OpenWRT with the EA4500. I’m probably overlooking something or just am not getting the settings correct at all lol.</p><p>So the wireless radio(s) on this unit will only be for connecting to another AP for its WAN connection. (Client mode only NO repeating)(No sec; Security is done via MAC Address)<br />Router will be DHCP server for the LAN</p><p>Can someone point me to a nice how-to/video or try explaining it here? </p><p> If your wondering why I didn’t just use dd-wrt again, well, the EA4500 isn’t supported and frankly from what little I’ve seen it looks like openwrt is the better choice. Can do so much more by the looks. For now though can someone point me in the right direction to get this thing going?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry guys for the premature post above. After fooling around for a while I did get it to connect in the way I wanted. By shear luck at that. When I was &quot;Joining Network&quot;&nbsp; I was changing the &quot;Name of new network&quot; to match my naming scheme of things <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> instead of leaving it at &quot;wwan&quot;. Well after many failed attempts to get internet I gave it a last go and now at this time I&#039;m tired or ranaming it and just left what was there (wwan). After the setting were applied I reboot the router for good measure and when she came back online there it was. ipv4 wan coming from the wifi <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Now what I&#039;m search for information on...</p><p>Is there any type of package to control antenna configurations?<br />Are there packages that show better detailed wireless information/status?<br />Anything to set fixed rates if need be? (However its working fine how it is. Rate changes are smooth and doesn&#039;t drop like my other router (more antennas i assume))</p><p>One thing that I have noticed and seems odd is the TX rate shows 1.0Mbit/s at all times however I get the expected upload rate. Was thinking this is because TX power is set to auto?</p><br /><p>Any insight is welcomed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>krj7709</strong> on 17 Jan 2018, 08:30)</p>
