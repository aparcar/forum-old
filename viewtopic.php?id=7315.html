					<p>Working with RC5 on a WRT54GL, I can&#039;t get dhcp-option 66 to work.<br />Even if all other settings from dnsmasq.conf get processed, this one doesn&#039;t.<br />So I decided to call dnsmasq manually, specifying this option as in the following cmd:<br />&nbsp; dnsmasq -K -F 10.41.10.20,10.41.10.40,255.255.0.0,12h -I vlan1 -O 66,10.41.10.10<br />or else <br />&nbsp; dnsmasq -K -F 10.41.10.20,10.41.10.40,255.255.0.0,12h -I vlan1 --dhcp-option=66,10.41.10.10<br />but even this way, my WRT54GL won&#039;t send out this information when a client performs a dhcp-request. That is what ethereal tells me.</p><p>Anybody an idea, is this a bug, a restriction somewhere from dnsmasq, or just something I didn&#039;t see?</p><p>Thanks already.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi peng,</p><p>thanks for your answer.<br />I&#039;m using thomson IP-phones, and they can use both options 66 &amp; 150 to the same end.</p><p>Nevertheless, this topic has found a solution in a different way than I expected.<br />The answer lay in my ignorence of the dhcp-protocol, but I didn&#039;t find it on the web...<br />so I hope by posting it, I can help some others.</p><p>In fact this option 66 is working, as are all other options probably!<br />But what I didn&#039;t know was that in order to see this information sent out, you need a dhcp request that contains this option.<br />Therefore, tracing with ethereal on a computer will never show this option 66 because the computer never asks for it.<br />But it does show up on the communication with the ip-phones.</p><p>Hope this information finds its way to others in a similar situation.</p><p>S</p>									</div>
