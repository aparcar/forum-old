					<p>Hello all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I finally got my router back up and running. There was some confusion about the IP on my part. However, I read on these forums (after failing to flash with the vendor&#039;s own firmware) that the TEW-652BRP doesn&#039;t accept the TEW-652BRP firmware from Trendnet, and the TEW-632BRP firmware has to be used. I did this, and now my router works. However, I can&#039;t figure out how to get the correct TEW-652BRP firmware back on it so I can continue to put OpenWRT on it. I saw a post that talked about editing the firmware binary with a hex editor so that the ID matched the desired device. I&#039;m a bit fuzzy on how to do this, I don&#039;t know what string i&#039;m looking for in the binary file. Any help would be much appreciated.!</p>									</div>

					<p>After trying again I realized it was my mistake. I was looking at the .zip in the hex editor instead of the .uni or .bin. I found the ID at the end of the file just fine and will edit it tonight.</p>									</div>

					<p>I need help with recovery flashing as well. After a last attempt to compile openwrt trunk, make didn&#039;t produce the usual *squashfs.uni file. I tried to flash it with a squashfs.bin and the router doesn&#039;t work anymore. It boots directly into recovery mode EVERY TIME. I thought ok, no problem, flash an older build, BUT I always get the wrong device ID error. I tried everything several times: openwrt trendnet tew-652, tew-632, d-link dir-615 images. I even downloaded all the original manufacturer images of all those devices and tried to flash those, but I still always got the wrong ID error... I used to do recovery flashing in the past without problems.</p><p>Is there a way to know which string is the right to flash??? Is there a way to flash the router over serial??? I found on x-wrt, that there apparently is serial on the board and that the router uses uboot as loader. No idea on that however...Any help is much appreciated!</p>									</div>
