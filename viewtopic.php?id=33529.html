					<p>Hello<br />I would like to ask about plans connected with further development of at91 support. If anyone knows something about At91sam9X25 architecture support I mean especially AT91sam9g25. My company is planning to work with this platform and I wonder if there is any chance to work with OpenWrt in the near future. Thanks for any replies.</p>									</div>
