					<p>Hey zloop,</p><p>Thanks for the details, I&#039;ll test this within the next few days and I&#039;ll let you know.</p><p>Reading your post about bluetooth audio, I noticed that you were reffering to bluez5. I&#039;m using bluez-libs and bluez-utils 3.36, but these are depreciated version of bluez. And since I have the latest version of bluez on my laptop, I thought that this might the cause of my problem.</p><p>I&#039;m a bit of a noob regarding openwrt and linux, but do you mind indicating me where I can find the bluez5 package for openwrt, or should I simply use bluez 5.33 release from the official website.</p>									</div>

					<p>Update on my attempt at getting this to work.</p><p>I tried to include the bluez package into my kernel image. I got a series of dependencies that I tried to satisfy, one after the other (ever in hope that it was the last). So far it doesn&#039;t work, nevertheless I&#039;m writing down what I did for anyone interested in doing to same thing or if anyone sees a simple shortcut. Like I said, I&#039;m a noob, and I&#039;ve trespassed the limit of my knowledge at the moment I opened the topic.</p><p>I got the bluez package this way (extract from the makefile):<br />PKG_NAME:=bluez<br />PKG_VERSION:=5.33<br />PKG_SOURCE:=$(PKG_NAME)-$(PKG_VERSION).tar.gz<br />PKG_SOURCE_URL:=http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/<br />PKG_MD5SUM:=e7f479e6820b93a63fef56b560f2d975</p><p>It had dependencies on udev and glib2, which were availabe in my menuconfig. I only had to make sure that they were built ahead of time. (added +udev, +glib2 to the makefile)</p><p>Then libical was needed:<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/libs/libical/Makefile">https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blo … l/Makefile</a><br />+libical</p><p>And libreadline:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/libs/readline/Makefile?rev=4137">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/package … e?rev=4137</a><br />+readline</p><p>Then systemd was needed (this is a link to a how-to, which I followed):<br /><a href="https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-systemd">https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-systemd</a><br />+systemd</p><p>Then Perl-XML-parser was needed by systemd...<br /><a href="http://home.mag.cx/openwrt/source/mk/kamikaze/package/perl-xml-parser/">http://home.mag.cx/openwrt/source/mk/ka … ml-parser/</a></p><p>Which uses ipkg (it&#039;s depreciated, I know), but since I&#039;m cross-compiling, I don&#039;t have it on my host and I don&#039;t have opkg either. I tried to replace the command with dpkg, but I&#039;m not sure if it worked fine.</p><p>And now I&#039;m missing libmount... which is part of util-linux:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/utils/util-linux?rev=40302&amp;order=name">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/p … order=name</a></p><p>And this point however, this is starting to make a lot of changes... and the systemd required me to change compilation from uClibc to eglibc, which, I&#039;m afraid will backfire at one point.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;m going to try a bit more. If it doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;ll put this aside and try to find another solution.</p><p>This seems to be referring to what I&#039;m experiencing with my bluetooth problem, even though the patch hasn&#039;t been retained, I might try to modify bluez-utils to incorporate the patch.<br /><a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-bluetooth/msg10266.html">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-blue … 10266.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I got it to work.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure of what I did, I&#039;ll do some test to figure out exactly what has been the turning point. In regard to bluez, I dropped the idea of building bluez5 and used bluez4 instead, which built like a charm.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if it bluez4 that made the difference, but in any case someone needs it:</p><p>Bluez4 package:<br />PKG_NAME:=bluez<br />PKG_VERSION:=4.101<br />PKG_RELEASE:=4<br />PKG_SOURCE:=$(PKG_NAME)-$(PKG_VERSION).tar.gz<br />PKG_SOURCE_URL:=http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/<br />PKG_MD5SUM:=fb42cb7038c380eb0e2fa208987c96ad</p><p>List of dependencies for bluez4:<br /><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bluez4/">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bluez4/</a></p><p>They were all available in my menuconfig, so I didn&#039;t had to search further.</p><p>I&#039;ll post an update, once I&#039;ll have figured out the exact steps to solve the initial problem.</p>									</div>
