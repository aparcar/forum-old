					<p>Has anyone done any dev work for port forwarding via the web interface?&nbsp; I am currently using RC4 and saw no such page present.</p><p>I&#039;ve written a page using haserl and the modular structure (with light modification to /usr/lib/webif/webif.sh to add a few display formatting functions, although this may be unnecessary) and adding a separate port-forward.awk file to support parsing of /etc/firewall.user.</p><p>It currently supports adding and deleting of entries and does error checking to verify no duplicate entries or multiple entries for a port/protocol are entered.&nbsp; I would love to contribute as I believe this is a great project and it has given me the ability to do a lot more with my WRT54G than I could using HyperWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is such page in pre-RC5 by nbl. ( Checkout downloads / people / nbl @ <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">http://www.openwrt.org</a> ) </p><p>Maybe you should check out what it looks with his port opening page.</p><p>It looks pretty good for people that like to read iptables -L but it could be a little better, I once re-flashed my wrt54gs becaus it got messed up that badly that no ports openeded at all. Reason was that I made port ranges open and I configured it wrong. (I configured both outbound port ranges + target port ranges, when target port ranges should not be configured when configuring port ranges) After this, I wasn&#039;t able to make it work no more, so I reflashed and emptied my setup.</p><p>Also, I have a pretty good idea (I think). There should be description for opened ports, a field where user can save a custom string describing what reason these ports are open. I have a bad memory and I run servers in my network, I have pretty many ports open, for ftp, http, ssh and port ranges for NX plus more, so after six months when I decide to check my setup I am about to wonder, what is this port that is open because there&#039;s no description why it&#039;s open..</p>									</div>
