					<p>I have a travel router with a single radio (as I believe all do).&nbsp; I have a WAN facing wireless connection and a LAN facing wireless connection.&nbsp; The RJ-45 is on the LAN side.</p><p>When I want to change the WWAN connection (Scan and select another network to join) I loose my LAN side connection.&nbsp; </p><p>Is there a way to prevent this from happening?</p><p>Also is there a way to change the default start page for LuCi to the Network =&gt; Wifi tab or possibly to the Scan page?&nbsp; I would like to make it easier to access the portal, especially from a cell phone.</p><p>Thanks..
