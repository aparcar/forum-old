					<p>Hello to all developers.</p><p>I have an idea. Don&#039;t know if it is interesting or not, but...<br />I bricked 2 WL500g during experiments with OpenWRT. Mostly because of following steps designed for other HW (interfaces vlan0 instead of br0 and it was gone - disconnected from network).<br />I found out, that the reset button is working during startup and the device responds to it&#039;s previously set IP address.<br />But even after reflash I was unable to connect.</p><p>I tried almost everything and after 2 hours of labouring I found out, that reflashing an Oleg&#039;s firmware helps - it resets nvram to defaults for wl500g during the first boot.<br />But it have even more interesting feature - the reset option.<br />You can push and hold the reset button and the actions goes something like this:<br />1st 5 seconds - the power led starts to blink and if released, the reouter restarts<br />2nd 5 seconds - the power led shuts down and if released, the reouter will shut down<br />3rd 5 seconds - the power led blinks in very short interval - if released, the nvram will be reseted to default and the router will be restarted.</p><p>I found this feature very handy and reflashing to Oleg is my usual help when I screw up the nvram settings during experiments.</p><p>Maybe, it could be a good idea to set the reset function the same way in OpenWRT.<br />Did anyone think about this one?</p>									</div>
