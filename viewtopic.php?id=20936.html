					<p>&quot;opkg list&quot; will give you a good list of what you can install on your router with a single command. My favorites are openvpn and asterisk! But you can also do a jabber server, mail server, bittorrent, etc. Almost anything you can do with a normal linux server you can do with openwrt, it is very powerful.</p>									</div>
