					<p>Hi,</p><p>Am I being stupid? I don&#039;t think so, but...</p><p>The IP address of my router is listed in (WhiteRussian) openwrt administrative console as &#039;xx.35.72.1&#039;, that&#039;s vlan1, but this didn&#039;t seem to work with VNC (remote operation of another computer I use to help someone admin their machine), eventually I used whatismyip.com and it listed my IP as something different. I used another 2 webpages that list your IP and they listed it as the same as whatsmyip.com. The IP addresses are similar though, the first 2 IP sections are the same, the second 2 are different.</p><p>What&#039;s going on?</p><p>Many thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I see the problem... that page is connections that vlan1 has.&nbsp; Namely, to your ISP&#039;s gateway.</p><p>Much is coming back to me now because I went through this attempting to get my IP for DynDNS updating in a quick and dirty fashion.&nbsp; And it didn&#039;t exist natively.&nbsp; I ended up creating my own page JUST for this purpose (but mine is the ppp0 connection, not vlan1).&nbsp; Otherwise, this is just one of those anomalies of the webif.</p>									</div>

					<p>Many thanks guys. The confusing thing is that the &#039;admin console&#039; (connect to router from web browser) clearly implies that the IP address of the router is as shown, which it is not.</p><p>IP address&nbsp; HW type Flags HW address&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mask&nbsp; &nbsp;Device <br />xx.xx.72.1&nbsp; 0x1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x2&nbsp; &nbsp;00:0B:FC:43:B8:A8&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;vlan1</p><p>When I need my router&#039;s IP in future I&#039;ll just use &#039;ifconfig vlan1&#039; or whatsmyip.com as they both seem pretty quick.</p><br /><p>Bartman007 -- &quot;I haven&#039;t used White Russian for years&quot; --</p><p>Should I be upgrading to Kamikaze then Bart? What advantages would there be? WR seems excellent, I realised when I rebooted the router yesterday to see if that &#039;updated&#039; the &#039;admin console&#039; IP address, that the router had been on and continuously connected for 5 months without ever being turned off or rebooted and I&#039;ve never had a single problem with it. OpenWRT rocks !!</p><p>Not quite as long as an old Linux distribution I had (Red Hat something about 6-7 years ago) which was running on an ancient 286 PC with 64MB RAM, it served only as a (rather slow) database server running MySQL. It wasn&#039;t rebooted or turned off for 2 years, and ran flawlessly (after 2 years I needed a faster machine, otherwise who knows how long it would have served me). I doubt Microsoft has ever had an OS that would do that.</p><p>Thanks all.</p>									</div>
