					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m using KAMIKAZE (8.09.2, r18961).</p><p>I have a router which is configured to forward some specific ports to the outside, via a public adress (let&#039;s say my public adress is myprivateserver.com, and that I installed port forwarding for port 443 to allow access to 192.168.1.10:443 and for port 444 to allow access to 192.168.1.11:443).</p><p>If I connect to myprivateserver.com:443 from anywhere, I can connect without problem.<br />If I connect to myprivateserver.com:443 from inside the LAN, I get the message that no connection is possible.</p><p>How do I configure my router to allow &quot;WAN-like&quot; connection from the LAN ? The question is important for me: if I connect from the LAN using the LAN adress of my router, I can&#039;t check if I&#039;ve correctly set the port forwarding.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help</p><p>Olivier Subilia</p>									</div>

					<p>User mbm gives the answer in posting:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4030">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4030</a></p><p>I recently used his /etc/firewall.user rules to allow printing to port 9100 from inside the LAN:</p><p>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d x.x.x.x -p tcp --dport 80 \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.2<br />iptables -A forwarding_rule -p tcp --dport 80 -d 10.0.0.2 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -s 10.0.0.0/24 -p tcp --dport 80 \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -d 10.0.0.2 -j MASQUERADE</p><p>As he explains:</p><p>&quot;x.x.x.x is my external IP address; I want it so when I connect to that IP<br />address that it gets forwarded to my internal webserver which is 10.0.0.2.<br />The problem is this:</p><p>request: 10.0.0.x (some random lan machine) -&gt; x.x.x.x (external ip)<br />-&gt; 10.0.0.2 (websever)<br />response: 10.0.0.2 -&gt; 10.0.0.x</p><p>I&#039;ve connected to x.x.x.x but the response came from 10.0.0.2 .. oops. To<br />correct this, a masquerade is done using the third rule. This has the<br />unfortunate side effect of hiding the original source address, but it does<br />correct the issue with the response. Since this only applies to machines on<br />the lan subnet, I&#039;ve added a -s; this allows proper logging of requests<br />from outside the lan.&quot;</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the advice. I didn&#039;t notice this post.</p><p>But I still see two problems (if I&#039;ve understood correctly, I&#039;m almost everything but a network expert...)</p><p>1. As nbm said:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>nbm wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The problem is this means that your ip can nolonger change; any time you get a new ip address you&#039;d have to rerun the firewall</p></blockquote></div><p>And that&#039;s a serious problem: I&#039;ve a dynamic IP (yes, maybe I could change this, but if I want a fixed address, I MUST have a SLOWER connection to the internet. Yeah, administration, you know, ...) so my rule will not last forever...</p><p>2 If my comprehension is good: you have to define ONE rule for EACH port you want to forward (and --dport should have been 9100 in your example, and not 80. Is it correct ?). If it&#039;s true, well, it&#039;s not really easy. I&#039;ve a bunch of https webservers inside my network, so I must define one port for each server (with a different IP lan address). If the goal is to check why this f*** connection doesn&#039;t work, and if that for I must create three rules for each connection, the risk that the connection doesn&#039;t work because of the iptables rules rather than the port forwarding is really high.</p><p>Anyhow, thank you for the explanation. I&#039;ll try asap.</p><p>Olivier Subilia</p>									</div>

					<p>@ Adze: No this (clearly better from a technical point of view) solution is not the one I want. If myprivateserver.com resolves as 192.168.1.10, and is consequently not routed, I can&#039;t check how routing functions... I want the traffic from inside to (myprivateserver.com, so )inside to be routed to chek how routing functions.</p><p>This function was basically installed in my Linksys before I installed OpenWRT. The configuration of OpenWRT is great, the possibilities are great, too, but this function (routing as from WAN communications that physically come from LAN port) lacks from my point of view.</p><p>Olivier Subilia</p>									</div>

					<p>I had a similar problem, maybe my solution can help anyone in the future.</p><p>I have four networks: lan, wan, wlan, dmz<br />The dmz includes two servers, thus I couldnt just add a dns entry to make the services available for lan and wlan.<br />So, I want all traffic that has my wan ip as destination to be NATed as if it comes from the wan interface. </p><p>On backfire, I added this rule:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d xx.xx.xx.xx -j zone_wan_prerouting</code></pre></div><p>where xx.xx.xx.xx is the ip of the wan interface.

					<p>Hi JimWright,</p><p>I think the problem is that you forward the web server ports to the LAN subnet. If you do so, you will have to add a MASQUERADE rule like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -d $WEBSERVER_LANIP -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQUERADE</code></pre></div><p>If you forward the web server ports to a different subnet (e.g. DMZ), you won&#039;t need masquerading but you will have to activate forwarding from LAN to DMZ at least for the web server ports.</p><p>By the way: You seem to have a dynamic wan ip address. Do you restart the firewall on reconnects?</p>									</div>

					<p>So, you already found the problem: You are trying to forward port 80 to your webserver, but this traffic is handled by the uhttpd of the openwrt device.<br />This is due to the facts that uhttp listens on all subnets and the traffic that comes from br_lan is accepted in the INPUT chain which means that it will be processed locally. </p><p>I think you have to options:<br />* edit /etc/config/uhttpd so that uhttpd only listens on the local subnet<br />* modify the iptables for zone_lan so that packets to port 80 are dropped, hence they won&#039;t be processed locally and never reach the uhttpd</p>									</div>

					<p>Apparently anything hitting the router&#039;s WAN address from the LAN is getting directed to the router itself, not just port 80.&nbsp; Port 22 and others are being directed there as well, so what you&#039;re suggestion wouldn&#039;t help.&nbsp; What I need to do at this point if determine why anything going to the WAN IP is being directed to the router itself and not routed.</p><p>My logging right now stops after the zone_lan_prerouting rule.&nbsp; Next up should have been the POSTROUTING chain, but nothing ever gets logged there.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was referring to post #8 and assuming you want the router to act as if you accessed from WAN when you actually access the WAN IP from LAN. In order to guard against misunderstandings: could you please specify what you are trying to set up?!</p>									</div>

					<p>On my LAN, I run a web server, and an email server, both on the same box.&nbsp; Assume that my DNS name is example.com, I need <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a> to correctly route to my web server, and I need users to be able to check their mail accounts (user1@example.com, etc) both internally and externally.&nbsp; At a minimum ports 25, 80, 110, and 443 need to route to this server.&nbsp; There is also the web interface on the router itself, which on the LAN is accessed on port 80, and via the wan via port 81&nbsp; (<a href="http://example.com:81">http://example.com:81</a>).&nbsp; I also have several other devices accessed via non-standard ports from the WAN (including several using port 22), but these can all be accessed normally via the LAN, and do not need the DNS name mapping used externally. </p><p>I want to use as much of the Luci web interface to set this up as possible, Firewall/Traffic Control &amp; Firewall/Traffic Redirection are set correctly for these ports to route correctly for external connections.&nbsp; As there doesn&#039;t appear to be anything in the Luci interface to handle what I need done on the LAN side.&nbsp; Some common terms I&#039;ve read for this setup are Hairpin NAT and NAT Reflection.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, success!&nbsp; Some more googling and searching the forums here revealed a solution:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=109259#p109259">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 59#p109259</a></p><p>I had found that script a few days ago, but thought it was doing more than what I wanted done (thanks to my misreading it, I thought it was handling opening ports on the WAN side as well), but after studying it a bit closer I figured out what it was doing, and saw that I only needed the do_hairpin routine.&nbsp; I set up a test for ports 25, 80, 110, and I&#039;m now able to get Mail and view my web server using my DNS name correctly.</p>									</div>

					<p>I never tried this with ports 80 and 443, which are actually handled by the router device itself, but here is what does work for me when I want to forward e.g. port 25 to 192.168.1.10:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A zone_lan_prerouting -p tcp --dport 25 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.10:25

					<p>OK, tested that by itself without the hairpin script, using port 80 since that was easier to quickly test.&nbsp; Failed totally.&nbsp; Not only could I not reach my web server by DNS name, I could no longer connect to the router&#039;s web page on the LAN.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks vali for the iptables rule. Short and effective.
