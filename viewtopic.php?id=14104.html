					<p>Hi,<br />first of all I need to mention that this is my first experience with OpenWRT and I did my best to find a solution myself but no luck.</p><p>I took whiterussian rc5 and added one file blue.html to /www/cgi-bin . This file shows a splash screen and in 0 sec redirects to /www/cgi-bin/blue/test_connection.sh (second added file, readable and executable by all).</p><p>I am able to load <a href="http://192.168.1.1/blue.html">http://192.168.1.1/blue.html</a> , it shows up perfectly then it redirects to second file. At this stage I have a problem as browser reports - &quot;404 Not Found. The requested URL was not found on this server.&quot;</p><p>I tried to check for possible errors in readlog but was unable to locate anything related.</p><p>I just do not know why it happens and which tools to use to track down the origin of this issue.</p><p>Need to mention that if I go to OpenWRT command shell (by ssh) and download test_connection.sh from outer server it works.</p><p>Your kind suggestions are quite appreciated.</p>									</div>

I took default OpenWRT firmware and added 2 files:<br />/www/blue.html<br />/www/cgi-bin/blue/test_connection.sh</p><p>blue.html has meta refresh which leads to &quot;/cgi-bin/blue/test_connection.sh&quot;.</p><p>If I access &quot;<a href="http://192.168.1.1/blue.html">http://192.168.1.1/blue.html</a>&quot; I do get my splash screen, and in a few seconds browser accesses &quot;<a href="http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/blue/test_connection.sh">http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/blue/test_connection.sh</a>&quot;, and at this stage I am getting 404 error, e.g. file not found. File test_connection.sh is in place, has executable and readable permissions set. So I do not know why httpd server reports that this file is missing. Checking &quot;ls -l /www/cgi-bin/blue/&quot; I can see the file, I also can &quot;cat&quot; it content and it is correct.</p><p>Hope that will help to see the problem I am facing.</p><p>UPDATE1: double slash removed</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>otlabs</strong> on 16 Jan 2008, 16:59)</p>

					<p>The only thing I can see a bit problem is the double slash (//) after the IP address. Maybe it is missinterpreted by the server and therefore failling.<br />I had no problem to do such redirect (without double slashes) on my router&#039;s web page...</p>									</div>

					<p>hi,<br />i would like to make you know that I have solved (question to verify all files) this issue - I had some carriage returns in shell script (probably from DOS encoding) and they were killing haserl. removing CR made script to work.</p><p>thanks for your kind discussion and willing to help.</p>									</div>
