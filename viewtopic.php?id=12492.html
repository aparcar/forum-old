					<p>Hey Folks.&nbsp; My buddy&#039;s got a shiny newWL500gP with 707 (2.4) loaded, sitting on his PPPoE line and running well .. mostly.</p><p>The router stops responding to the net.&nbsp; He comes home, in a flurry, and reboots the toaster before the wife gets home (and kills the project).&nbsp; All is well.&nbsp; Repeat once or twice a day (no pattern yet).</p><p>He&#039;s going to go back to WR within the day, but I wanted to know:<br /> - anyone else seeing this?&nbsp; Are you on Earthlink (via Mindspring) and NOT seeing anything hinky with PPPoE?<br /> - is WR really as abandoned as I fear?<br /> - My regional telco uses DHCP over DSL.&nbsp; Why do some idiot companies get to use crappy MTU-munging hacks without dying?</p><p>Okay, the last one is optional.&nbsp; I&#039;m used to having more choice, and maybe some people in the third world and the eastern US don&#039;t have that choice, and I feel for people like them.&nbsp; Thanks for your eyeballs, and any help you can provide.</p><p> - bish</p>									</div>

					<p>The lack of responses give me hope, and suggest to me that the number of people inflicted with PPPoE is a small and relatively treatable number.&nbsp; Like polio, maybe one day the disease which is PPPoE can be eradicated!</p><p>My buddy hasn&#039;t gone to Cable yet, nor has he gone to WhiteRussian.&nbsp; If you have any suggestions or input, worry not that the opportunity has passed you by.&nbsp; Anything you can suggest to help us get a handle on this problem would be appreciated -- I&#039;d like to prevent going back to WR, just because I get the feeling that it&#039;s completely unloved, these days.&nbsp; Barring suggestions, I&#039;d well-receive any word of confidence about WR&#039;s PPPoE kit:&nbsp; I&#039;m of the opinion just yet that a problem which is fixed in KK707 may have existed since long before, and may or may not have existed in WR09 with no similar fix on the horizon.</p>									</div>
