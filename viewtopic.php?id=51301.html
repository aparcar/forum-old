					<p>Hi guys.</p><p>I need some help with configuring. <br />My Internet provider has Ethernet network with Internet connection via NAT.<br />I have found that connection with another client in the network via Skype is very slow (about 3-4 kb\s). We both using routers with openwrt firmware. UPnP was configured and works fine. <br />When I (or another client!) connect provider&#039;s Ethernet cable without router - all works without any troubles. (file transfer speed is almost 100 mbit\s).</p><p>What I did wrong? Local network&#039;s DC++ client works fine.</p><p>p.s. All traffic goes through server in another country...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Frozen2006</strong> on 26 Jun 2014, 23:08)</p>
