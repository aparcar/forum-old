					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to create a Openwrt image that can easily be installed by low tech users to replace TP LINK router firmware through router web interface so making new OpenWRT deployments simple. Once firmware image has been installed and router rebooted LAN IP DHCP and WIFI SSID are already configured, WAN port set as DHCP client etc so nothing for user to do and router just plugs in and works.</p><p>How can I do this ? It must be possible as other companies are doing it., </p><p>best regards</p><p>Ralph.</p>									</div>

					<p>You need to create a personal firmware build with &quot;custom files&quot;.

The router might work right out of the flash.<br />(You can set wireless options for many routers so that you can avoid giving exact hardware MAC addresses in config.)</p><p>Second option:<br />If you need different settings for site A and site B, create a directory where you store the settings as Openwrt settings backups. They can then be restored via Luci GUI.</p><p>(You configure one router for site A, and &quot;backup&quot; its settings via Luci GUI to create the settings archive file, e.g. /etc/Settings_for_company_X/Site_A.tar.gz. Then the same for site B. So that all optional settings are stored in the same directory in the firmware and the low-level tech can select the correct archive to restore.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 28 Jul 2014, 19:24)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I simply want an image that low tech users can upgrade their TP LINK routers with through the web interface and and install OpenWRT and once the router reboots everything works with zero touch. So when I create the custom files I can set LAN IP, DHCP scope, SSID and add whatever packages I choose and enable auto start for these packages ?? Apologies but not an expert on compiling an OpenWRT image.</p><p>Your help is appreciated.</p><p>kind regards</p><p>Ralph</p>									</div>

					<p>All you have to do is include a wireless configuration file. Everything else is already done automatically by Openwrt.</p><p>You don&#039;t need to compile anything. You just need to add a single file with Image Builder.</p>									</div>
