					<p>Hello all,</p><p>Title says most of it - I am having difficulty wirelessly connecting my Epson Artisan 837 to this router with OpenWrt. I have tried to configure it on the printer itself and on the computer using the wizard from the CD that came with the printer. </p><p>When trying to configure via the printer interface, the router is visible in the dialogue, but it will never connect. Also when using the CD wizard, the router is also visible but it fails to connect to it. </p><p>Any ideas on how to get this printer wirelessly connected to the network?</p><p>Thanks much!</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, I figured this out on my own and I&#039;ll share the solution in the event others encounter this problem. </p><p>On the 2.4Ghz band (which the printer communicates on), I had to change to 802.11b mode from 802.11g+n mode to complete the communication setup process. Once this was successfully completed I was able to switch back to 802.11g+n mode and the communication link remained. The printer is now printing just fine via wifi and I am able to use the n band with the computer.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>Great router with OpenWrt</p>									</div>

					<p>Really helpful - thanks Egore!</p><p>We have 4 HP wireless printers that could not somehow connect to the wireless network after upgrading to openwrt. Changed mode to g then all the printers were back online. If I set it back to g+n, however, I am unable to print again. 802.11g is ok for my use so no problem with that.</p>									</div>
