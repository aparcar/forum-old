					<p>Hello!</p><p>I tried to install Barrier Bracker 14.07.&nbsp; Accesspoint is a TL-WR841nd v8.22. Client is a TL-WR741nd v4.22.</p><p>The Accesspoint seem to run normal with OpenWRT. Wifi devices can connect to access Internet.</p><p>But I don&#039;t get the TL-WR741nd to work as Client (or Client WDS/TL-WR841nd Accesspoint WDS). If I connect/join the 741 through Survey Page to the 841, a connection will be established, both status pages show flow of packages. But no connection to the Internet or other devices over the 741-841 connection are possible.</p><p>Another 740n running DD-WRT can connect to the 841 as client.</p><p>Crossreading lots of foren posts I have read somewhere Client mode is broken for most Atheros devices running OpenWRT and it is better to flash back to stock FW. Is it really true?! I hoped it is just some missconfigured setting for the 741?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>micha123</strong> on 2 Dec 2014, 00:01)</p>

					<p>Reading the WIKIs once more I realized I should try out WDS mode again (OSI Layer 2 transparency...). And I found my mistake during configuration - at least for WDS. I had configured WPA/WPA2 PSK for WDS encryption. Maybe there will be older clients for the AP not supporting WPA2-PSK.</p><p>Wasn&#039;t good. Switched back to WPA2-PSK and connection worked at once.</p>									</div>
