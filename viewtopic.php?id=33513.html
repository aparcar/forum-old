					<p>Hi,</p><p>My ISP allows up to 3 public addresses. I&#039;m using WRT160NL with 10.03.1-RC6<br />I would like to pull 2 addresses on the WAN (eth1) interface. one for regular NAT and another for a VoIP box (of the ISP, no access to it). The secondary address will be fully NATed to the VoIP box.</p><p>I&#039;ve read across that ppl report success adding secondary interface via ifconfig\ip although I didn&#039;t manage to do so.</p><p>I also thought of a solution to bridge eth1 with the port that the VoIP box is connected.</p><p>Has anyone did something similar?</p>									</div>

					<p>I did a workaround by NATing the phone. Of-course this isn&#039;t a good solution both on Security aspect (SP has access to my LAN) and also get support from VoIP service provider.</p><p>I&#039;ll update if I&#039;ll find another solution though I would thought this is pretty trivial setup.</p>									</div>
