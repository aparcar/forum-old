					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m a first time user so please be gentle <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I have an Routerboard Rb751 and I followed the guide here (<a href="http://blog.poettner.de/2011/05/27/openwrt-trunk-on-mikrotik-routerboard-411750/">http://blog.poettner.de/2011/05/27/open … rd-411750/</a>)</p><p>OpenWRT is installed and running great.</p><p>I want to install&nbsp; kmod-usb2 because my plan is the get a 3g connection going on the board.</p><p>The issue I have is that it won&#039;t let me download it because it says that my kernel is too old. </p><p>So I tried to upgrade the kernel with sysupgrade but that didn&#039;t work as sysupgrade says its not supported on rb751...</p><p>So how can I get a newer kernel? Surely if I downloaded the latest source from the svn repo I would have the latest kernel?</p><p>Does anyone perhaps have some advice?</p>									</div>

					<p>The number of times I see &quot;I downloaded a -insert-&quot; and now it doesn&#039;t work.<br />If you have firmware that is specific, you will need to compile your own code for modules.<br />Or you could try the official openWRT release</p>									</div>

					<p>So you already built your own image? Then just build a new image with the kmod-usb2 included (i.e. select it from the menuconfig) and install that. Kernel modules are always tied to the exact kernel you have built, so downloading one from the repository does not work.</p><p>Of course, you could&#039;ve installed the supported version 12.09-rc1 directly from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/ar71xx/nand/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … 71xx/nand/</a>. In this case you can just download additional modules from the repository.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks a lot snk, to be honest I didn&#039;t go through menuconfig that much but I see that kmod-usb2 is there!</p><p>I will rebuild the image with all the modules I need.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
