					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;d like to put a WRT54GS in my car. Maybe there are some real hardware geeks among you who can answer some questions.</p><p>Is the normal 12 V car voltage dangerous for the router? How tolerant is it to fluctuations in the voltage? (I&#039;d plan to use a backup battery to compensate when starting the engine as I&#039;ve done it with the already implemented PC in the car). Or do I have to stabilize the voltage?</p><p>What about an antenna to the outside world? Are there any wlan car antennas which I can permanently fix to the car? I don&#039;t like having an antenna inside...<br />I it possible to use a mobile phone antenna as there are plenty available? They are for 2.4 Ghz, too. Or are there differences in antenna design which makes it impossible to use?</p><p>The thing I&#039;d finally like to do is to rsync my vdr movies from my home server to a harddisk attached to an ASUS router with an USB harddisk in the car. (Right now I take the whole PC with me and apart from the hassle its great).</p><p>Thanks for any answers.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a WRT54G in my car also, but it is powered off a piece of hardware I bought from <a href="http://www.mini-box.com">www.mini-box.com</a> <br />Basically you need to go to your electronics store and buy a 12V voltage regulator and a low voltage dropout. This should protect it from the extremes your car can cause (18V with a new battery or a broken alternator, down to 6V while starting your car)</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m planning on using one in my car as well sometime soon. I think I read on several places that the Linksys can handle up to something like 48Volts (google for it), so I was hoping to directly connect it to the battery. I haven&#039;t tested one yet though.</p><p>Not sure about GSM antennas. I was planning on installing one behind the fender (or maybe two, one front one rear).</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d suggest running power cables to your car for rsync.&nbsp; Or keeping a deep cycle battery.&nbsp; Have you tried copying movies across wireless?&nbsp; Even with SpeedBooster, its still going to take aeons.&nbsp; It&#039;s best left for overnight runs, and even with the nominal router power drain, you could still chunk your car battery. </p><p>Your general plan is solid though.&nbsp; You can also get USB sound cards.&nbsp; They work great in combo with Ati Remote Wonders, which have wonderful linux support.&nbsp; Add a USB VFD display and you are seriously hooked up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve currently got a Low-Voltage pentium 800 as my car computer, jacked in to a WRT54GS, but I&#039;m thinking of switching to router-only now that I&#039;ve got a bunch of USB routers.&nbsp; Soon as I get a WGT634U running linux that is.&nbsp; Consider: faster boot, far less line noise on the 12v supply (really, it makes a HUGE difference to the sound system not running an ATX power supply), infinitely better power consumption.&nbsp; All for the low low price of a relatively measely CPU! But who cares about that!</p><p>The easiest way to hook it up would be to either just use a 70w power inverter from walmart ($23) or hack-install it (much cleaner looking) and wire it to the mains (the, err, 12v mains).&nbsp; This will give you wall power which you can then plug back into.&nbsp; It will be stable and you&#039;ll never have to worry about blowing anything up.&nbsp; The biggest problem is starting your car; the as babtras stated, the 6v voltage will axe anything running unless it was designed for it.&nbsp; These routers were not.</p>									</div>

					<p>At least in the US, cell phone antennas (GSM or otherwise) don&#039;t run at 2.4GHZ.&nbsp; They run at one or more of these frequency bands: 850 MHZ, 900 MHZ, 1800 MHZ and 1900 MHZ.&nbsp; However, check out <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/War-Driving-World">http://stores.ebay.com/War-Driving-World</a>&nbsp; also known as <a href="http://www.wardrivingworld.com">www.wardrivingworld.com</a>.&nbsp; They have some magnetic mount antennas that look promising.&nbsp; </p><p>Another approach to consider for powering your WRT in the car is to get an inverter (Targus makes one) that converts the car&#039;s DC to AC.&nbsp; They plug in to the cigarette lighter, and have a standard AC outlet.&nbsp; Then, if you have a car like mine that doesn&#039;t supply power to the lighter socket when the car is off or being started, you can get an inexpensive UPS, plug it into the inverter, and then the WRT into the UPS. I do this with an old laptop whose runtime off AC power is 0.00 seconds. Using the UPS allows me to turn off the car for a short time, but keep the laptop up. While this approach is a bit power lossy, it is fairly hassle free.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRT54GS V1.0 has a switchmode voltage regulator chip in it - it can handle a voltage from between 7VDC to 24VDC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a look inside a WRT54G V3.1 and I can&#039;t see the same chip - and I know for sure that a WRT54G v1.0 is only a 5VDC device.&nbsp; So do a bit of research on your version of WRT54GS - you might be able to plug the car&#039;s voltage straight into it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I would not recommend plugging any consumer electronics into a car system without some filtering and regulation....</p><p>I&#039;ve been driving with a PC in my van for about 4 years; I&#039;m about to install an OpenWrt powered router as well.</p><p>Car voltages can go as high as 72 V (google for load dump), so you need some serious regulation.&nbsp; I can dig up some links on the regulators I am using.&nbsp; Also, car voltage isn&#039;t really DC; it has all sorts of AC from spark plugs and so on.&nbsp; So you need a choke and a capacitor.&nbsp; All in all, if you&#039;re mediocre with a soldering iron, you can put together a pretty solid 0.7 amp regulated DC power supply for under US$10.&nbsp; If you buy one commercially, they will want ludicrous sums of money for the same thing.....</p><p>Survival of the gear aside, the electrical noise in unfiltered and unregulated car DC will bleed over into the sound, and you will get a high-pitched whine that goes up and down with engine RPM and possibly even transmission speed (I still haven&#039;t figured that out; I guess the electronics in my transmission must be injecting lots of noise into the electrical system....)</p><p>Let me dig up a few manufacturers&#039; references; the voltage regualtors are about US$3, capacitors are &lt; $1, the choke is probably $2, the heatsink is ususally available from a nearby deceased PC.&nbsp; Depending on the AP you have, you will need two or maybe 3 regulator chips so maybe US$15 for parts at most.</p><p>--Yan</p>									</div>

					<p>A simple way out is to buy a cheap cell phone/CD player/iPod adapter and modify it.<br />Or you can buy a cheap power inverter and you&#039;ll have plenty of capacity for running some other devices as well.</p><p>In practice, a large capacitor and choke will work well enough.</p>									</div>
