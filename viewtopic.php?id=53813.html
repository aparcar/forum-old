					<p>Hi all,<br />I purchased newly launched model by nexx - WT3020H a while back! <br />Today I noticed that we have some support for this device available on openwrt. Here is the link:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/nexx/wt3020">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/nexx/wt3020</a></p><p>My problem is that I am not able to figure out how to install the openwrt firmware on my device. I downloaded the precompiled flash files available for the device and tried to update the same using the router web interface but nothing happens - router is not accepting the flash file.</p><p>Can someone please help here ? Detailed instruction on flashing the openwrt firmware in WT3020H device would be much appreciated!</p>									</div>
