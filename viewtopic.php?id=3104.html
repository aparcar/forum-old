					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Have been a semi-regular lurker here since I got my WRT54G about 12 months back.</p><p>I&#039;m planning to install OpenWRT onto my router this weekend, and just wanted to check my logic before I destroy my web connection!</p><p>Firstly - what I want to achieve:<br />1. Wireless routing of my Web connnection (with WPA PSK)<br />2. DHCP &amp; DNS functions<br />3. Configurable SPI firewall<br />4. NTP daemon, sourcing time from external source then synching my network<br />5. A Reliable device that doesn&#039;t crash under load <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Later, I will look into using snort and possibly some authentication with Radius against a Samba server on my LAN, but that&#039;s another day &amp; another topic.</p><p>I believe that all, or most, of these functions are all stock standard in the White Russian RC3 build.<br />I know that DHCP &amp; DNS provided by dnsmasq and iptables is built-in for the firewalling.</p><p>So, to the questions:<br />I think that there is an NTP client built in (rdate?) but is there an NTP daemon for synching my network?<br />Does iptables have a default set of rules for the first boot, or will it be open from the start? I&#039;m assuming it starts with a Deny All incoming requests, and leaves it there?<br />can anyone pass on any &#039;traps for young players&#039; - things to look out for?</p><p>TIA for your help!<br />Cheers,<br />Dog</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, <br />Yes for all </p><p>I&#039;have got a WTR54G V1 router, running all services exept Wireless you would like to have.<br />I use WhiteRussian RC 3 and i am a appy man !!!</p><p>The ntp server is openntp. It synchonize itself to a list of european ntp stratum 2 server pools. do not forget to add listen port to ntpd.conf file.</p><p>You have got a standard iptables script running fine. <br />Most of Parameters (from Linksys firmware) are saved in nvram and directly use back by OpenWrt. So your router is functional as soon as the firstboot.<br />You just have to add port forwarding if nedeed. I also suppress icmp on wan interface.<br />dnsmasq run fine if you use the last version (dnsmasq - 2.22-2) so download it !</p><p>Bye<br />Marc</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>m3z</strong> on 31 Oct 2005, 22:43)</p>
