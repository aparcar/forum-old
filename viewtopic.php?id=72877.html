					<p>Hello All.</p><p>I&#039;m Trying to configure my WNDR4300 as a WIFI acces point connecting the Netgear via 5Ghz to the main router and creating a new WIFI via 2.4Ghz, i installed ChaosCalmer 15.05/LuCI and did the following without success:</p><br /><p>0- Connect the Netgear to my Laptop via Ethernet and get into OpenWrt Menu (192.168.1.1) <br />1- Connect to main router via 5Ghz (Client mode)<br />2- Create LAN WIFI via 2,4Ghz (Master mode) with a different name.<br />3- Disable FIREWALL Script.<br />4- I also have tried to set client and master mode in the same radio without success.<br />5- I read something about disabling DCHP Server in the br-lan interface but after that, i canÂ´t access again to the Netgear and neet to factory reset.</p><p>I&#039;m sure i&#039;m missing something important, like creating new password, or enabling or disabling something else (My Knowledge is very poor on this).</p><p>Thanks for reading and excuse me for my bad english,</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jhoanstc</strong> on 30 Dec 2017, 00:47)</p>

					<p>You can&#039;t bridge a regular AP-STA connection.&nbsp; Instead set up a routed client.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is basically the default configuration (DHCP server on LAN, LAN forwards to WAN through firewall), except that your physical WAN connection is wireless.</p><p>Start with the default configuration.<br />Create and configure a wifi client interface with credentials to join the main router.&nbsp; I do <em>not</em> recommend using the &quot;join network&quot; button, do it manually in wifi settings.<br />Go to network interfaces, edit WAN, physical settings, and remove the ethernet port.&nbsp; Uncheck the &quot;bridge&quot; box-- WAN must not be a bridge, and must have only your wifi client in it.<br />If LAN IP address conflicts with WAN IP address obtained from the main router, change LAN IP address. </p><p>Your wired PC should now be routing to the Internet through the wireless connection to the main router.&nbsp; You can set up wifi AP&#039;s on either band in the usual way, connect them to LAN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 30 Dec 2017, 01:33)</p>
