					<p>Reverting to a vendor firmware<br />As I am searching for a way to revert back to stock firmware of Hootoo HT-tm05, just found this &#039;How to&#039; in the firmware mod kit wiki page here: <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmware-mod-kit/wikis/Documentation.wiki">https://code.google.com/archive/p/firmw … ation.wiki</a></p><p><strong>Reverting to a vendor firmware</strong></p><p>Sometimes you&#039;ll enthusiastically flash a third-party firmware like Gargoyle or DD-WRT only to discover it lacks features you need, doesn&#039;t perform as well as the vendor firmware, or has functional problems. In this situation, you might find yourself wanting to go back to the vendor firmware, but have no way to do so!</p><p>Here&#039;s how the Firmware Mod Kit can help you revert to a vendor firmware. The process is this:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Extract vendor firmware. Then rename the &#039;fmk&#039; directory.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Extract third-party &#039;upgrade&#039; firmware (e.g. Gargoyle-sysupgrade)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Replace extracted third-party firmware&#039;s rootfs and image_parts with those from the vendor firmware.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rebuild firmware image<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Flash vendor firmware image (now packaged as your third-party firmware expects).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If all succeeded, you&#039;re now using the vendor firmware again.</p><p>Once you are back to the vendor firmware, then it accepts vendor firmware images again.</p><br /><p>as i m not a pro guy, i cant do it myself. my reference image is this: <a href="http://www.hootoo.com/media/downloads/HooToo%20TM05-Support%20exFAT&amp;HFS%20-%202.000.068.rar">http://www.hootoo.com/media/downloads/H … 00.068.rar</a></p><p>i want to revert back to stock firmware. can anyone rebuild this firmware image for me to flash back to an openwrt installed device?</p><p>my original need hel post that i was posting every day for last week. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>So, i m eagerly searching for a solution. i m totally ignorant to this topic, just flashed openwrt image on hootoo tm05 that can be found on openwrt wiki link. after playing with it, i m now almost sure i just dont want openwrt and want to revert back to stock firmware. i m just not this kind of technical guy. my bad decision was to install openwrt before knowing it clearly smile</p><p>however, last on week i searched the wiki pages, forum and google for easiest way to revert to stock firmware, but i m undone. i dont have any backup copy of the firmware.bin. somehow, there is some post where says i can revert to stock firmware through ethernet cable like how we installed openwrt firmware at this device. but i cannot find any clear idea. is there any kind friend who will show me how to easily (without opening the device) revert to stock firmware?</p><p>can someone share stock firmware.bin backup of Hootoo HT-TM05, with which i can flash back to stock firmware from openwrt.</p><p>regards.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>somewhere i found this tutorial:</p><p>1. download latest firmware for your routers (makes it easy to rename it to something simple .bin)<br />2. download winscp (google it its FREE)<br />3. reset your router to default settings with a hard reset<br />4. login to your router 192.168.1.1 with the SCP protocol<br />5. upload your firmware to the /tmp directory (do not change directory!)<br />6. push ctrl+t or click on commands menu than on open terminal<br />7. type this command in:<br />mtd -r write firmware.bin firmware (change firmware.bin to your bin)</p><p>and i tried this method with your given link. that doesn&#039;t work. every times gives error. after trying this i should install openwrt again because the router didn&#039;t give me any signal.</p><p>i followed this process to install openwrt:</p><p>Download this OpenWrt firmware: Link<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Place it in the root of a clean TFTP server running on your computer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rename the image to kernel — be sure there is no file extension, and that there are no other files on the TFTP server.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Plug the HT-TM05 into your computer via ethernet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Set your computer to use 10.10.10.254 as its IP address.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; With your HT-TM05 shut down, hold down the power button until the first white LED lights up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Push and hold the reset button and release the power button. Continue holding the reset button for 30 seconds or until it begins searching for files on your TFTP server, whichever comes first.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The HT-TM05 will look for your computer at 10.10.10.254 and install the kernel file. Once it has finished installation of the kernel file, it will search for a (nonexistent) rootfs file — when it begins searching for this file, shut down the HT-TM05 by holding the power button normally.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Start up your HT-TM05 normally. When the Wi-Fi indicator turns green, OpenWrt has booted successfully.</p>									</div>
