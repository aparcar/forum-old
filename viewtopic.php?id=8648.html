					<p>Hello everybody,<br />this is just a quick question from a n00b, i&#039;ve created my own OpenWRT image, added and customized packages with OpenWRT development environment, cross-compiled SD module and so on.</p><p>Now there&#039;s just a quick question:<br />I want to add some simple files, change something and so on into /etc directory (on final WRT image), maded this by issuing these commands:</p><p>- make clean<br />- edited files, added and so on...<br />- make world</p><p>Is there a quick way to do this ? i just want to recompile the base-files package and add only files modified inside its ./package/base-files/default/etc dir, in this way compiling takes ages.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your reply<br />Regards</p><p>Ben</p>									</div>

					<p>If you just want to replace particular files in the final image then you only need the ImageBuilder. Nothing gets recompiled - it just assembles a firmware image file containing the set of packages which you choose plus the override files you choose.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know about ImageBuilder, but i&#039;ve installed Devel Environment &#039;cause i want to add some extra features to OpenWRT custom image, i&#039;ve built the MMC module for my buffalo and inserted some custom programs (gpio but also something for my own) i personally built for making it act as some sort of ethernet applicance, is it possible to use only development environment instead of installing also ImageBuilder ? i need to make the work twice in this way.</p><p>Cheers<br />Ben</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the easiest way is the ImageBuilder. To use the WhiteRussian buildroot do:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd ~/whiterussian

make image_clean package/base-files-clean world</code></pre></div><p>This rebuilds the base-files package and recreates the images.

What I do is to use the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/BuildingPackagesHowTo">SDK</a> to build my custom ipkg&#039;s, and then the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/ImageBuilderHowTo">ImageBuilder</a> to assemble a custom firmware image comprising some stock OpenWRT ipkg&#039;s, my custom ones, and some custom startup scripts and config files.</p><p>I don&#039;t see a need for using BuildRoot, unless you&#039;re actually modifying the source of existing packages, or hacking the kernel. As for the &#039;MMC module&#039; you refer to, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a kernel module or not. If it is, then maybe it needs to be built within the BuildRoot environment. But even then, once you&#039;ve done it once and created your kmod-buffalo-mmc.ipkg or whatever, then you can just copy it over to ImageBuilder and use that in future.</p><p>HTH, Brian.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK,<br />thanks a lot guys, i&#039;ve tried what forum2006 reported and worked fine.<br />For Brian: i&#039;ll give ImageBuilder a try, but as you noticed i need to hack the kernel, MMC module needs to be supported into the kernel, i&#039;ve also added some nice features (ext2 support, some busybox mods, NFS and others) so my buffalo can use an external SD (studied the linksys hack to port to Buffalo WHRs), i don&#039;t need external IPKGs so my only needs is to customize the original kernel.<br />Maybe it&#039;s stupid to report but i&#039;m using this AP as an ethernet appliance and for my needs wifi card is not necessary, i&#039;m using it &#039;cause the hardware is the cheapest i&#039;ve ever found for this task.<br />OpenWRT really rocks, stable and robust linux distro, keep it simple as it is, this is the real advantage of it.</p><p>Cheers<br />Ben</p>									</div>
