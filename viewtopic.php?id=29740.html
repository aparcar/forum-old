					<p>Hello<br />I just finished configuring my router after flashing Openwrt Backfire 10.03.1-rc4 the second time on it.<br />Somehow it managed to destroy itself yesterday, still no idea why.</p><p>After debricking it today I started over with installing usb, works great. (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.essentials</a>)</p><p>The next step was the guide for 3g connections. (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wired.wan.with.3g.dongle">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/wired â€¦ .3g.dongle</a>)<br />I would also like to add: You do not need a pin code configured like mentioned in the guide, it works also fine without. At least for me.</p><p>After connecting with &quot;ifup wan&quot; I can access over WLAN the internet.<br />But somehow not always. Its more random.</p><p>When I am not able to browse the web I can still ping websites and resolve names from the computer.<br />Sometimes it works after another reconnect or a second, no idea why.<br />I only tried this for the wireless connection.</p><p>Another thing i couldnt figure out yet is that DHCP only works for wireless clients, but not wired ones.<br />Kind of curious because the two interfaces are bridged together.</p><br /><p>Maybe somebody of you allready bumped into something like this, else I am doomed I guess.</p><br /><p>Here some configuration files I think that are interessting for you, <br />if there is anything else I can provide just tell me.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># /etc/config/network

					<p>Hello again, <br />just to push this again a little closer to the front.</p><p>Also im now thinking it could have something to do with MTU sizes.<br />WLAN client can send max 1492 ping that works.<br />ppp0 has a MTU of 1500 set in the router.</p><p>mtu_fix is enabled for wan but it really doesnt seem to help all the time.<br />Like I said before, it seems completely random from reconnect to reconnect.<br />Sometimes it works perfect, then again no way.</p><p>With kind regards<br />Reaper36</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok</p><p>I was thinking it was some screw up in my configuration.<br />But I also turned the MTU to a lower level and disabled dnsmasq.<br />With a static configured IP/DNS on the Clients it works just fine for me.</p><p>The problem with the low range of the WLAN is still present.<br />Configuration says its at maximum level but it still pretty sucks compared to the range of the original firmware.</p><p>But I think at this point lowering the MTU is the only way to get it somehow working.</p><p>With kind regards<br />Reaper36</p>									</div>

					<p>Well its about 20 dBm, and that is all that is allowed. Setting the value higher is not possible.<br />There must be some issue in the driver for the wlan module in this firmware version.</p><p>Maybe it will start working in some later firmware versions.<br />Backfire is still under heavy development, I am happy it allready works this great.</p><p>With kind regards<br />Reaper36</p>									</div>
