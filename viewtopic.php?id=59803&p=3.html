					<p>Hi @dibdot, Huge thanks for finally making an openwrt port of this adblock script!</p><p>I have installed the script and everything runs successfully on the first install, however it seems like there are still many ads not being blocked. I&#039;m guessing this is because I have not properly configured the pixel server.<br />For instance, the ads that are blocked just don&#039;t resolve the page like ---&gt; this - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JUYdqIv.png">https://i.imgur.com/JUYdqIv.png</a> instead of showing the blank pixel.</p><p>But even then there are still basic adsense ads that I would expect to return the same resolve error, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4hoZmwn.png">https://i.imgur.com/4hoZmwn.png</a> yet it still feels as though adsense is unblocked.</p><p>So yeah, it kinda seems like I missed one of the initial settings or something <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Thanks again!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cal3b</strong> on 3 Feb 2016, 18:21)</p>
