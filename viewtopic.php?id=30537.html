					<p>hi folks,</p><p>any chance that there&#039;ll be an eggdrop ssl build?<br />it&#039;s easy to compile for people that compile often,<br />just do: ./configure --with-ssl</p><p>that&#039;s it. i would do it myself, but i don&#039;t know how to compile for mipsel,<br />and i don&#039;t have a linux at hand.</p><p>i also tried using xrelayd to get eggdrop ssl capable, but it failed,<br />saying it can&#039;t write to ssl socket :(<br />also matrixtunnel and stunnel didn&#039;t work.<br />(always immediately disconnecting from remote host afer connect,<br />i think it&#039;s the same cause as in xrelayd)</p><p>but an eggdrop ssl build is better anyway, so the server list of eggdrop can be used,<br />and multiple ports / multiple remote hosts!</p><p>post back,<br />thanks!</p>									</div>
