					<p>A spam is for money, you may notice that there are no advertisement at all at the mentioned site.<br />Then for the how-to, the download from the mentioned site is packed with them:<br />How-to make a KVM virtual openwrt machine from scratch<br />How-to make KVM debian, Fedora, Ubuntu machines from scratch<br />How-to make UML virtual machines OpenWrt, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian from scratch<br />How-to have your virtual network inside your machine with ospf running, (or olsr).<br />You may not be interested, but others may be, the spam insult is not adequate.<br />OpenWrt is the default machine in the cloonix virtual net, I simply supposed that I could mention it here, I do not know where I should mention the existence of this new network tool.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Documentation is not only paperwork, it can be a pointer to something that contains information.

					<p>I code a lot, what do I do to make it public?<br />If you have a solution for open-source diffusion without self-promo at least the first year after a product is born, tell me, I am receptive to any suggestions.<br />You are not into virtualization and networks, but I am into those themes, I use my portable network every-day to code network-related stuff, I use my debian virtual machine but OpenWrt is so light that I have elected it to be the official default machine.<br />My site is the HOW-TO have a 40 OpenWrt virtual network with a graphical interface. Double-click on a machine to have an ssh terminal on that machine, create and destroy lans with mouse clicks...<br />A little self-promo to launch the code does not hurt anyone and the software seem to make people happy when they try it.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know about you and/or anyone. However, if I had to do what you wanted to do, I would contact the site admins/moderators to let them know and/or ask them to provide link to your site. So far, I don&#039;t see no site admins nor moderators on this forum enforce the spam rules.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, at least you did react to my &quot;spam&quot; and suggested something. I would like to contact moderators, but this is never easy on any forum, and I feel it is even more impolite than to post here. If this is not appropriate, well they will just erase the thread, I will not &quot;spam&quot; here anymore, I have seen that most of the OpenWrt forum is more hardware-oriented. I discovered OpenWrt only recently because different users of cloonix-net wanted me to add this target to my virtual network to play with simulated wireless networks. I found the creation of OpenWrt from scratch very pleasant and its small size made it an ideal demonstration target for my network.&nbsp; You probably use OpenWrt on real hardware, but OpenWrt, having only small needs in resources, can be used for large-scale wireless network emulation and this new way of using OpenWrt should only bring more fame to it.</p>									</div>
