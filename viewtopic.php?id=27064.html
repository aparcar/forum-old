					<p>Hi!</p><p>Here&#039;s the scenario:</p><p>I have 4 buildings on a squared disposal and I need only one local network for them.<br />I have a mesh network like this: I have 1 AP inside each of the 4 buildings and 3 APs on the outside to provide connection and bandwidth between the buildings. On each AP inside the building, there is a switch routing all the traffic from the cabled clients to the AP, and then, wirelesly to other buildings.<br />This is working fine, but, for client&#039;s paranoid reasons, I need to deny any client that tries to stablish a connecton wirelesly to the AP.<br />Resuming: Only cabled clients can connect to the AP and the APs must be a wireless mesh network.</p><p>I thought about doing a MAC filtering to deny all MACs (except the one of the wireless mesh), and use the &quot;secure olsr&quot; plugin to add some kind of security to the olsr broadcast.</p><p>Will this work? Is this enough to guarantee the wireless network connection isolation ?</p><p>If you have other suggestion, please, let me know.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is no easy way to do that. You could look into WPA-NONE which should work for madwifi and ath9k.</p>									</div>
