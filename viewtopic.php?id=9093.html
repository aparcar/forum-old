					<p>Is that the same for the rootfs ?</p><p>The message implies that it would have been RW but because it want on an erase boundary, it was set to RO.</p><p>This agrees with what I&#039;m seeing on my modem as it does not retain changes after a boot.

					<p>If you flashed a squashfs image, then squashfs is what goes on the rootfs partition...<br />By the way, the filesystem/image stuff of AR7 is different than what you have on a WRT54GS. Different boot loader, different image type, different scripts...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Z3ro,</p><p>I tried your suggestion but it didnt work. Below is what was shown on the screen</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/bin# firstboot switch2jffs<br />Unlocking OpenWrt ...<br />Erasing OpenWrt ...<br />mount: mounting none on / failed<br />mount: mounting /dev/mtdblock/4 on /rom/jffs failed<br />copying files ... done<br />mount: mounting /mnt/sys on /sys failed<br />mount: mounting /rom/sys on /sys failed<br />root@OpenWrt:~/root/bin#</p><p>The switch2jffs2 only recopied the files. The above looks promising except for the fact of the failed messages.</p><p>I executed the lines in firstboot manually to check the responses and got the following</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/bin# mtd erase OpenWrt<br />Unlocking OpenWrt ...<br />Erasing OpenWrt ...</p><p>executed without error</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/bin# mount -o remount,ro none<br />mount: mounting none on /mnt failed</p><p>failed. I checked /mnt it was there with nothing in it.</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/bin# mount -o bind / /mnt</p><p>Came back to the prompt with no messages</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/bin# mount /dev/mtdblock/4 /rom/jffs -t jffs2<br />mount: mounting /dev/mtdblock/4 on /rom/jffs failed</p><p>Seems /rom/jffs already exists and with nothing in it.</p><p>Interesting, /mnt now has a copy of / in it, and /rom/jffs also has a copy of /</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/bin# umount /mnt</p><p>No messages, /mnt still exists and with the same copy of / in it</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/bin# pivot /rom /mnt<br />/bin/ash: pivot: not found</p><p>I&#039;ll have to see if I can find where pivot is meant to be. I have also seen mention of nvram in some scripts and havent been able to find that either. Is that meant for the WRT54X&#039;s ?</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion,<br />Andrew</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>I&#039;ve got the same problem with Asmax AR 804gu (Aztech DWL600EW).</p><p>Try this:</p><p>1. After flashing, telnet to device and type reboot (for sure).<br />2. Telnet again and execute firstboot - this will copy files to /rom/jffs (I don&#039;t know why this is not happening after first reboot).<br />3. Type reboot (not unplug the power).<br />4. When device is up, you should have writable root fs mounted on /.</p><p>Because Kamikaze comes without mini_fo (I think) to edit files, you have to remove symlinks, copy file form squash fs and then edit it. For example, to change root password, you have to do this before passwd:</p><p>rm /etc/passwd<br />cp /rom/passwd /etc/</p><p>Booboo.</p>									</div>

					<p>The &quot;not aligned to erase boundary&quot; is normal.
