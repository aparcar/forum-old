					<p>hi,<br />I&#039;m wondering why the line &quot;export HOME=/tmp&quot; is in /etc/profile. I tried to add a new user, but ran into the problem that e.g. weechat wouldnt work, &quot;cd&quot; always got me into the wrong dir etc...<br />so after some searching I found the culprit in /etc/profile..</p><p>so.. why exactly is that there?<br />1. it works perfectly without that line (HOME still defined if i run env as root)<br />2. it breaks adding new users</p><p>bug or feature?</p>									</div>

Well, it&#039;s an opinion that&#039;s shared with virtually every other shell I could find... they all assume HOME is already set by the &quot;login&quot; program. OpenWRT seems to assume that &quot;root&quot; will be the only interactive user, the only user who needs a writable HOME directory, and in most installations, /tmp is the only reasonable choice.</p><p>Personally, if/when I add more users to an OpenWRT installation, I&#039;ll remove that line from /etc/profile - I really can&#039;t see a reason for it - root&#039;s home directory is set as /tmp in /etc/passwd, which is exactly where everyone&#039;s HOME is set.</p>									</div>
