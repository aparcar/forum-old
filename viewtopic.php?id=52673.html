					<p>I have been working on LuCI for about several months. I am not familiar with it. I figure out its frame work, read most of its source code. Say it is easy for me to change something of it.But it is some sort of passive mode which means I need some motivation for me to actively develop. I am sure I does&#039;t go deep enough , and I need learn more. So I wonder how I can play part in the developing game of LuCI , learning from others and developing.</p><p>Yeah, I have registered the mail list.&nbsp; I just ask if there other path.</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>									</div>
