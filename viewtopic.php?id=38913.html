					<p>I premise I&#039;ve been running OpenWRT on a number of devices since 3 years now. I wouldn&#039;t describe myself as a newbie.<br />I&#039;ve donwloaded trunk r33270 (25.aug.2012) in order to upgrade from r33212 (21.aug.2012).<br />As soon as I flashed the firmware I got my box bricked: only the power led is on.<br />As soon as I power cycle the box&nbsp; I have all leds flashing for a moment. Then the power led stays on with a short flash of &quot;internet&quot; led.<br />Then only the power led is on.<br />Of course it&#039;s not working with either the default cfg (192.168.0.1) nor with my custom one (I&#039;ve requested to keep the settings).<br />The wiki is not useful and both the reset and the qss buttons seems to be uneffective.<br />Should I open the box, solder the serial pad and go the hard way, or is there another non intrusive option?<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi uqbar,</p><p>it&#039;s &quot;funny&quot; (hope u got the irony), i have the same problem with my WR1043ND and the current trunk build (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38943">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38943</a>). What i can say is, that access via serial console isnt working (used it several times before THIS brick, the last days). So before you open the box i suggest u wait until the pros hopefully come up with a solution. But i fear that somehow the bootloader got fucked up so that we need to unsolder the flash chip and reflash it (i wont do that though) <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I can confirm this. Coincidentally, Mirko was visiting Hong Kong and the problem was fixed quickly using serial and TFTP. Caveat: Find a proper ground connection if you see garbage on serial.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can also confirm that current trunk bricks 1043nd.<br />I&#039;ve been building my own trunk for a couple years now, had a few problems along the way, but nothing that wasn&#039;t sorted out by a failsafe, I was always able to recover.<br />The tplink always seemed much more resilient than other hardware I&#039;d used. But that was then, and this is now. <br />Just upgraded trunk to 33444 this morning. Built the image and flashed it. Now I have a brand new doorstop <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; I guess I shouldn&#039;t have been so complacent, should have re-read the page that actually says this will brick the unit.<br />Anyways, for what its worth, while I was flashing the unit I saw something that I hadn&#039;t seen before while flashing.<br />It said that my jffs partition needed to be fixed and it was going to fix it for me.<br />I wish it asked if I wanted it fixed <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I am able to get the led&#039;s to flash quickly, just as you would expect from failsafe, but I have no access to the unit.</p><p>So, I&#039;m off to the store to buy another unit. Just wanting some clarity, which version is safe?</p>									</div>

					<p>It turns out I need to modify my earlier statement. My router is not bricked.</p><p>I noticed that my cell phone had a wireless connection to the unit still. Upon checking it out I find that the unit is fine, I am able to log into it via ssh over wifi without any issues at all. Almost everything is as it was except for WAN.<br />Not sure what exactly has changed, but the wan led is not lighting up nor do I actually have a working wan.</p><p>All my custom files are still intact, all the software I put on the unit is still there. Even the custom configs are still operating as they always have, I just have no wan.</p><p>Would anyone know any commands I could issue to perhaps bring up the wan port?</p>									</div>
