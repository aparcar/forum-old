					<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I&#039;m not a very experienced linux or openwrt user. This project was my first experience with Linux. However, I&#039;ve struggled through thiis and finally won the battle. My biggest frustration was the lack of information out there. Every search seemed to only pop up the same few sources. So I&#039;m creating this not because I think that I&#039;m a great source of information on this subject, but simply because there needs to be more information out there. I tried to give as complete of an overview without writing too large of a novel. If anything needs more clarification, or if there&#039;s any questions let me know and I&#039;ll do my best to fix it/answer the questions. </p><p>Finally, a lot of this information is being written down from memory. I&#039;ve been working on this off and on for the past month. So a lot of it may not be completely accurate, and it is not a step by step guide. It&#039;s more of an aggregation of resources and overviews.<br />______________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>Situation:</strong> I got a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH router and a Western Digital Elements 2.5 TB (during an excellent sale) external HDD. The Buffalo router had a USB port on the back for network attached storage (NAS). The router came with Buffalo&#039;s own DD-WRT type firmware. </p><br /><p>Upon initially setting up the router and HDD, the router would not format the external HDD. Even after formatting it with a linux live CD and then plugging it in it would not recognise the drive. Installing DD-WRT was my next step. I was again unable to properly format and mount the drive. I then decided to move onto Openwrt.</p><p><strong>TFTP flashing to Openwrt</strong><br />I used this guide to flash the router <a href="http://g300nh.blogspot.com/2010/06/firmware-flash-and-brick-recovery.html">http://g300nh.blogspot.com/2010/06/firm â€¦ overy.html</a> following one commenter&#039;s instructions to use the program &#039;Pumpkin&#039; and &quot;WZR-HP-G300NH is 02-AA-BB-CC-DD-1A&quot; MAC address. </p><p>I spent many many many hours trying to get this to work before coming across a enhancement ticket ( <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8672">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8672</a> ) that said that the <strong>Openwrt Linux kernel openwrt is build off of was not compatible with a GUID partition table (GPT)</strong>. GPT&#039;s are needed vs the Master Boot Record (MBR). So this entire time the reason my HDD wouldn&#039;t work (but smaller drives I tested would work), was because the kernel didn&#039;t support its partitioning table which is different from the file system (in my case ext4).</p><br /><p>The solution would be to go into the kernel and change the option from a &#039;no&#039; to a &#039;yes&#039; for the GPT. This required using buildroot. It is important to note that I have at this point installed Linux Mint 11 on my computer (with dual boot for windows7). I do everything in Mint except for the flashing of the firmware with Pumpkin. </p><p><strong>Installing Buildroot</strong><br />This guide was the most helpful for building and compiling a custom kernel. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a> . The commands that it gives are pretty straight forward. However the buildroot did initally give me errors when I tried to &quot;make menuconfig&quot;. This was due to missing packages that I unfortunately did not write down so I only remember &#039;zlib&#039; and &#039;ncurses&#039; one of&nbsp; which I had to go to the website and install instead of through the package manager for my Linux Mint OS. However, one of the commands, &#039;prereq&#039; should list the ones you are missing. You&#039;ll need to install those that are listed as missing then you&#039;ll be good.</p><p><strong>Using Buildroot to make a GPT compatible Kernel</strong><br />First do the &#039;make menuconfig&#039; and set it up for the&nbsp; WZR-HP-G300NH router. &quot;Target System (Atheros AR71xx/AR7240/AR913x/AR934x)&quot; &amp; &quot;Subtarget (Generic)&quot; &amp; &quot;Target Profile (Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH)&quot;. </p><p>Make sure you have downloaded and installed the feeds in the linked guide. Those are not optional. They contain important packages such as the luci-web interface (&#039;make menuconfig&#039; LuCI&gt;Collections&gt;luci). I neglected to include that in my first build and while the system worked great. I had no GUI.</p><p>Another important component to remember to install is the [&#039;make menuconfig&#039; Bootloaders&gt;uboot-ar71xx-nbg460n_550n_550nh]. Without that your router will not restart properly (all sorts of weird experiences without that if I pinged the router constantly after plugging it back in then it&#039;d load up for some reason otherwise it would be unresponsive on boot).</p><p>Some other configurations I did was change the IP address to 192.168.11.1 instead of 192.168.1.1 through the &#039;make menuconfig&#039; Image Configuration&gt;LAN IP Adress &amp; PreInit Configuration Options.</p><p>I also included packages needed for USB support (excellent guide for that here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.essentials</a> &amp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage</a> ). My Samba3 (filesharing) &amp; luci-app-samba (samba web GUI). Transmission-daemon (torrenting) &amp; Transmission-Web (web interface for Transmission). nano (file editing). NTPclient (system clock) I could not find and had to opkg install after flashing the router. </p><p>After finishing up with &#039;make menuconfig,&#039; which I encourage you to look around and play around with the different options, you should do the command &#039;make kernel_menuconfig&#039;. <strong>This is where we will enable the GPT partitions. &#039;make kernel_menuconfig&#039; File systems&gt;(enable ext4 here, or whatever you want to use)Partition Types&gt; EFI GUID Partition support </strong>. </p><br /><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you mess up on build and need to redo and remake an image, use the command &quot;make dirclean&quot; before you begin again. Otherwise you&#039;ll probably end up with errors.</p><p><strong>Flashing Custom Image</strong><br />After following the buildroot guide linked earlier and building your image then flashing like before (created image will be located in home/[username]/openwrt/trunk/bin/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g300nh-squashfs-tftp.bin).Setup your router&#039;s then get started on the samba. I formatted my drive in Gparted then connected it to my router. Then in the Mount points GUI, set it like so. (note: I also added 1gb of swap space on my HDD when formatting it that I have mounted here). </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Pm3Y3.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/Pm3Y3.png" /></span></p><p>Then Samba like so </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8TZrV.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/8TZrV.png" /></span></p><p><strong>Samba Permissions</strong><br />Sometimes I&#039;d have to play around with the settings in Samba to get the right permissions going (editing the files with &#039;nano /etc/samba/smb.conf&#039; &#039;nano /etc/samba/smb.conf.template&#039; &#039;nano /etc/config/samba&#039;). But amazingly this last time just using the web-GUI worked excellently.</p><p>With the Samba permissions working properly you now have to get the mount permissions set up. For this a simple <em>&quot;chmod -R 777 [mounted HDD path]&quot;</em> worked. </p><p><strong>Mounting Permissions</strong><br />I used these threads as reference for a lot of the permissions issues <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26625">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26625</a> &amp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=33011">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=33011</a> not all of it is applicable though. For instance mounting with &#039;umask=000&#039; doesn&#039;t work for the ext4 file system or something. Just gives an error.</p><p>Now you should be able to access the drive. Read and write files to it. If you can&#039;t, you may need to restart samba to have the changes take effect: <em>&#039;/etc/init.d/samba restart&#039;</em> will accomplish that. You&#039;ll need both permissions from Samba as well as permissions on how it&#039;s mounted for you to be able to read/write to it.</p><p><strong>Transmission</strong><br />Now it&#039;s a matter of getting transmission to work. There is no Luci GUI for this one. In telnet/ssh use the &#039;transmission-daemon&#039; with options to get it started. Use &#039;transmission-daemon --help&#039; for help on that. I&#039;m least familiar with how to set up transmission. I eventually just used &#039;nano /etc/config/transmission&#039; to edit the settings of transmission. Unlike Samba with its 3 configuration files Transmission only has one. <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/transmission">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/transmission</a> is very helpful for this part. </p><p>Make sure to have &quot;option enable 1&quot; and change &quot;option rpc_whitelist &#039;127.0.0.1,192.168.1.*&#039;&quot; to &quot;option rpc_whitelist &#039;127.0.0.1,192.168.<strong>11</strong>.*&#039; [Because I changed the default LAN address in the kernel configuration) . There&#039;s a lot of other cool configuration options here to play around with. Also be sure to have the download location point to a location on your HDD that you&#039;ve created. For example &quot;option download_dir &#039;/mnt/shared/Transmission/Done&#039;&quot;</p><p>Then the URL &#039;http://192.168.11.1:9091&quot; should take you right to the transmission web GUI. And mission complete.</p><p><em>If anybody wants the image of my openwrt build, just ask. I&#039;ll see about getting it uploaded somewhere</em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Zullwick</strong> on 17 Sep 2011, 08:59)</p>

					<p>Thanks drekthar.</p><p>On another note. I just noticed that in my Samba screenshot it has &quot;[777&quot; listed for the directory mask. This should read &quot;0777&quot;. &quot;[777&quot; seems to be working fine for me though. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
