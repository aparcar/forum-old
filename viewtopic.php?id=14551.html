Run tcpdump on the tun0 interface of B and try to ping C from B.&nbsp; You should see ICMP echo requests.&nbsp; If you do not, there is something wrong on B.<br />2. If you do see the packets in step 1, run tcpdump on the tun0 interface of A and ping again.&nbsp; If you see the packets there, then you know B is sending them to A correctly.<br />3. If 2 works, run tcpdump on the tun2 interface of A.&nbsp; Ping again.&nbsp; If you do not see the packets, there is a problem on A.<br />4. If 3 works, run tcpdump on the tun0 interface of C.&nbsp; Ping again.&nbsp; If you do not see the packets, there is an alien stealing some of the packets between A and C.&nbsp; (i.e. if the packets were leaving A, they should get to C, but you may as well make sure.)</p><p>Do the same tests again in the opposite order and ping from C to B.</p><p>So just run tcpdump on each interface between the source and the destination, one at a time, to find out which step is the problem.&nbsp; Once you know where to look, it will be easier to find the problem.</p>									</div>
