					<p>Hi,</p><p>i&#039;m trying to find out if there&#039;s a possiblilty to get the wrt54g work as a vpn client over the wan-interface.<br />The uncommon is that the proprietary cisco vpnclient has to be used...<br />I know there is eg an openvpn package but as far as i knows it won&#039;t work with it.<br />So because i&#039;m a newbie please let me now!</p><p>Aim is the following:<br />The wrt should act as a nat-router between my LAN an the internet (which is reached through the vpn). Now i&#039;m using a complete Linux-Computer to do that, but it&#039;s a lot of power needed for that of course.</p><p>Thanks ins Advance!!!<br />Juni</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought openswan wouldn&#039;t work as a cisco vpnclient?<br />Am i wrong?<br />If yes I&#039;ll try it, because openswan is available as a package for openwrt, isn&#039;t it?</p><p>Juni</p>									</div>
