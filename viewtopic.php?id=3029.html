					<p>Hi everyone.</p><p>I&#039;m trying to tweak linux/drivers/mtd/map/ar7_flash.c to allow for config partition to be located right after adam2 partition. That is not the common situation (nbd, thanks for telling me so) so I am tryting to recode the openwrt partition table gathering data from mtd variables directly instead of guessing what is which from the position in the flash.</p><p>For example, for Linksys ADSL2MUE, the partition table looks like this &lt;adam2&gt;&lt;config&gt;&lt;linux&gt;&lt;fs&gt;, while WAG54G shows the following &lt;adam2&gt;&lt;linux&gt;&lt;fs&gt;&lt;config&gt;.</p><p>Before nbd noticed the difference, the flash map resulted in kernel panic on ADSL2MUE, so I decided to make it work myself.</p><p>My modifications take partition data from mtd variables makeing the following assumptions:<br />-&gt; mtd0 == filesystem<br />-&gt; mtd1 == linux<br />-&gt; mtd2 == adam2/pspboot/any_bootloader<br />-&gt; mtd3 == configuration<br />But I need to be sure that those assumptions are correct on every piece of hardware based on AR7 that we may be dealing with.</p><p>And here is where I need your help: Could you please post if it is so for every piece of hardware you may know about detailing hardware and software revision?</p><p>Thanks for your valuable contribution.</p><p>Jose Angel</p>									</div>

					<p>The patch works on squashfs and jffs2 but has only been tested on single file version. And, please, keep in mind that the patch won&#039;t prevent you from reflashing from adam2/pspboot but it could result easily on kernel panic and halt right at the beggining of the booting process.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>joseangel</strong> on 6 Nov 2005, 15:23)</p>

					<p>OK, then. So from what we learnt, OpenWRT could just ignore mtd4 partitions and take mtd3 as readonly config partition. I say readonly because for AR7, for example, every config parameter and script is inside the squashfs/jffs2 partitions, not from nvram like the wrt54g does.</p><p>I understand why nbd does not like the mtd variable to meaning mapping, but by now I still think it is better than the flash location aproach currently used. I agree I should add some checking on partitions to make sure the mapping makes sense before giving it back to openwrt on boot, but I also think it is more versatile and future proof than address based partition recognition.</p><p>Of course, he is one of the developers and I am just a newbie, his opinion is far more valuable than mine. In the end I will try to help and align my efforts with him but perhaps I will leave my own compilation there to run on my own box.
