					<p>Hi all:</p><p>Apologies for a stupid question, but we all start from the bottom one day!</p><p>I am an experienced developper and know my way around Linux and gcc (which I use everyday at work).</p><p>I now have some applications I would like to port, and am not sure how I should go about compiling them so they work on my wrt54g.&nbsp; The code is really simple, and uses basic file io, sockets (although I could live without this) and a serial port (which I&#039;ve successfully added to my wrt).&nbsp; No external libraries are required, etc.</p><p>How would I go about building this code?&nbsp; I have untarred and built the openwrt &quot;distro&quot; if it matters.&nbsp; I assome I need to use the &quot;toolchain&quot; somehow.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>The best way to start, would be to look in the packages/* directories, at the Makefiles, and Config.in&#039;s and create your own subdirectory for your package.</p><p>Examine the makefiles, to see which environment variables are passed along to point to the crosscompiler that the OpenWRT build uses. You will also need to add a line for your packages&#039; Config.in into packages/Config.in, and add a target for your package to packages/Makefile.</p><p>Socket support, etc shouldn&#039;t be a problem. Many complicated packages run just fine on the WRTs. If you&#039;re lucky, you may not need to make any code changes at all.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TheRoDent</strong> on 26 Jun 2005, 23:03)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the answer TheRoDent.</p><p>Ok, I feel like a moron...&nbsp; I check the makefiles, etc.&nbsp; Looks all dandy.&nbsp; Where&#039;s the code!!!!!&nbsp; None of the packages I&#039;m looking at have code?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t there a &quot;so you wanna compile hello_world.c&quot; howto somewhere?</p><p>Funny how you think you&#039;re a rocket scientist until you try something new ;-b</p>									</div>

					<p>This was my intention, but I want to make sure I know a bit more what I&#039;m talking about as from experience, people are not too chatty when you ask for advice, but when you&#039;re trying to give some, they are quick to criticize!</p><p>I&#039;ll get my thoughts together!</p>									</div>
