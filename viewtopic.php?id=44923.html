					<p>I am running Attitude Adjustment 12.09 on a TP Link TL-WDR3600.&nbsp; I was trying to add a new forwarding rule to my firewall (for twc youtube throttle) and ended up rejecting all lan/wan ip&#039;s.&nbsp; So I am not able to log back into openwrt to fix the forwarding rule, when trying to connect with 192.168.1.1 the ip is rejected due to the rule i unfortunately set up.&nbsp; I am not very versed in linux, I have tried the generic debrick method but haven&#039;t been able to execute the process successfully.&nbsp; Is there anyway I can get back to the firewall settings and return the rules to default?&nbsp; Any suggestions are appreciated.</p>									</div>
