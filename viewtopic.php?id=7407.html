					<p>This question might be useful to people in general as it wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing to have some sort of page dedicated to knwoing the cheapest OpenWRT supported router at any given time.</p><p>I have a bare bones setup that would work on pretty much the smallest of OpenWRT devices (no need for 16mb+ SDRAM etc...).<br />I&#039;ve been asked to build a large number of units and I just don&#039;t know how to go about finding a source for devices that sell to me at a reaosnable cost for resale.</p><p>If anyone out there has any suggestions (or if you work for one of these manufacturers)&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to hear for you.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s not worth it to get those Belkins if you need them in volume.&nbsp; The price was that low due to mail-in rebates.<br />The Buffalo WHR-G54S (a 4MB flash/16MB ram model) can commonly be found for under $50 (USD)<br />The Linksys WRT54G can be found for the same price, but that is a 2MB/8MB model running VxWorks, so it requires additional steps to load OpenWRT.</p><p>I would suggest you go with the Buffalo WHR-G54S.&nbsp; I quickly searched across the net and found a few places were you could pick up more than 50 at a time for under $50/unit.</p>									</div>

					<p>All of these boards are unsupported yet, since they use the RTL8186 SoC, which is unsupported yet. Currently in the works is the RTL8651B, a Lexra LX5280-based SoC, which shares the same core with the 8186, so if we&#039;re finished with that, it won&#039;t be too hard to support 8186 also.</p><p>Edit: To avoid confusion, I was referring to the Straightcore boards.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wigyori</strong> on 25 Sep 2006, 15:43)</p>

					<p>The WISP I work with uses WRT54GL.&nbsp; Commonly available, already got the solder points arranged neatly in 2x5 for serial and 2x6 for JTAG ready for an easy solder-job to add the connectors.&nbsp; Simple 12-Volt power supply that is commonly available, and is very flexible on voltage it will accept from 7V up to 20V at least.&nbsp; Very good if you are doing simple passive PoE like I have done, where voltage may drop over an ethernet cable but in this case the WRT is forgiving of that.&nbsp; Power consumption about 5 Watts.</p><p>I have a Buffalo unit also to play with, but have to say it&#039;s inferior on all the points I just mentioned.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what the original poster&#039;s motivation is but I don&#039;t like to CHEAP OUT too much and have to do a lot of fiddling with hardware after installation.&nbsp; The GL is very temperature resistant also, I stick a simple aluminum ramsink on the CPU and have them in attics and outdoor enclosures in Georgia summertime no heat-related hardware problems so far.&nbsp; I did have a wasp-nest problem inside one enclosure where I hadn&#039;t sealed an entry point well enough.</p><p>I have used cheaper D-Link and SMC AP&#039;s in earlier years, and MY GOD you have no idea how annoying it is to get access to and climb up to replace a failed unit.&nbsp; Especially those dadgum D-Links every single one of them blew out within a year.&nbsp; Time is money and I spent way more in manhours FIXING the problem than I ever saved by shaving a couple of bucks off the original hardware, all of which I ended up replacing with GL units.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 13 Jun 2007, 03:58)</p>
