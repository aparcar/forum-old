					<p>Hi all,</p><p>With 17.01.4 were later builds of modules included such as the mwlwifi driver version?&nbsp; I was previously running 17.01.2 and had manually used a binary build of the latest mwlwifi as of September or so.&nbsp; I finally got everything stable just before Krak came around and did NOT feel like rebuilding everything, so I left it until now and finally updated to 17.01.4.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious if the mwlwifi version is newer or older than I was using. (It&#039;s a higher numeric version, but I recall there was some confusion with the packages when I downloaded the prebuilt for 17.01.2 where the numbers didn&#039;t necessarily match expectations.) </p><p>Also, does anybody know if MU-MIMO support for WRT3200 has made it in yet or is that still a future pipe dream?</p><p>Finally, somewhat unrelated, but when upgrading LEDE between service releases, configuration of course is preserved, but all the installed modules need to be reinstalled.&nbsp; Out of curiosity is there any convenient way of doing this beyond keeping a list of modules to manually install either one by one or on a giant shell string?&nbsp; Or better, an automated way? </p><p>And related to that, it&#039;s probably too early to know, but is it known when the next &quot;OpenWRT branded&quot; stable build releases if there will be a direct sysupgrade process or if a full clean config will be required?&nbsp; (I may have to get used to seeing &quot;LEDE&quot; on my router forever! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p>									</div>
