					<p>I have Openwrt on a WRT54g with my wired lan behind it. There is also a WAP11 connected to the WRT54G which I used for wireless access. The reason for the WAP11 is that the WRT54G is in the far corment of the house and the WAP11 is in the attic and provided house-wide coverage.</p><p>The WRT54G is downstream from another single purpose router which performs similar firewall functions to OpenWRT and each machine on the lan has a full compliment of security software.</p><p>What I would like to do is:</p><p>1) Eliminate the wireless support. To this end is setting wl0_radio enough or should I do more?</p><p>2)Turn off the OpenWRT firewall without impeding access.</p><p>The configuration without these changes is running fine but to optimize a little I might as well turn this stuff off.</p><p>Can someone comment on how to do this?</p><p>Jim</p>									</div>

There you can build images without the iwlib, kmod-brcm-wl, kmod-wl-compat, wificonf, wireless-tools packages. These packages are only required if you need wireless functionality. Makes room for lots of other packages.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>obrienj wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>2)Turn off the OpenWRT firewall without impeding access.</p></blockquote></div><p>I would like to prefer of changing the permissions on the init script instead of removing it.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod -x /etc/init.d/S45firewall</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>olli</strong> on 3 Mar 2006, 14:39)</p>
