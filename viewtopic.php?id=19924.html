					<p>Hi all</p><p>I have a WRT54GSv2 with stock firmware latest ver. on a gigabit network, except for the cable modem 100T</p><p>I was wondering if anyone has done any bandwidth testing on this unit.</p><p>The one I have gives up 3mb D/L on a 30mbit link, slams on the brakes at just over 3mb.</p><p>One tenth the performance of my other systems.</p><p>Maybe a&nbsp; bandwidth limiter is inside that brick.</p><p>Sure does look like the firmware is less then optimal.</p><p>Next test is to load openWRT and see if there&#039;s an improvement.</p><p>I&#039;ve also tested some DLink bricks, total waste of time.</p><p>Never was a big DLink fan.</p><p>So far my tests have shown that all these brick units simply don&#039;t perform.</p><p>Still have some other units to test, however if the rest follow in line then I would say some of these bricks are just that....bricks.</p><p>Also I did call Linksys Tech Support, the unit is out of warranty so they want me to bend over and get my wallet out....Sorry Linksys not today.</p><p>I also added them to my dial a joke list.</p><p>The chat Tech Sup is just that chit chat with a wall, never the less it&#039;s good to know there&#039;s life at the bottom of the food chain.</p><p>I do have a very strict rule about calling any support, I don&#039;t for last 10 years now, however I figured I would see if anything has changed.</p><p>Well you know the results of that test.</p><p>Fortunately people like to give me their junk so there&#039;s no out of pocket here, but still wanted to test these units and have some extra knowledge in the bank<br />for those having internet withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>Anyway my purpose is to eval these over the counter medications and find out the who&#039;s...who in the world of networking and then post the info.</p><p>Thank in advance for any supportive info.</p><p>Later</p>									</div>
