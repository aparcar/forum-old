					<p>Hi.<br />I installed the file &#039;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3040-v2-squashfs-factory.bin&#039;<br />on my TL-MR3040. Everything went fine during the installation but after it finished I wasn&#039;t able to access openwrt or the router at all. Going to 192.168.1.1 brought me to my Linksys WRT54G router setup page instead. The mr3040 router doesn&#039;t appear on my network list. What do you think I did wrong?<br />I was following the instructions on this page to make a piratebox:<br /><a href="http://www.disk91.com/2012/technology/systems/installation-of-a-piratebox-on-t-link-mr3040/">http://www.disk91.com/2012/technology/s â€¦ nk-mr3040/</a><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>
