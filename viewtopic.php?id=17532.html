					<p>Hi all,</p><br /><p>I just got myself a NSLU2, and I would like to unstall openwrt on it.</p><p>Based on the information needed here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/NSLU2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ksys/NSLU2</a>, I need an image called &quot;openwrt-nslu2-2.6-squashfs.bin&quot;.</p><p>However, I do not see this image on the download-area.<br />- There is a &quot;openwrt-nslu2-2.6.zImage&quot; (which seams to be a &quot;compressed kernel-image&quot;) but that is no &quot;squashfs&quot; file.<br />- There is a &quot;openwrt-ixp4xx-2.6-squashfs.img&quot;, but that file is called &quot;ixp4xx&quot;, not &quot;nslu2&quot;.</p><br /><p>I did try searching the web and the different howto&#039;s, but I did not find a full &quot;for sure&quot; answer.</p><p>So, before I brick the box, exactly what image do I need to upload (using &quot;upslug2&quot;).</p><p>Or do I need both of them (hence, use both the &quot;-i&quot; and &quot;-k&quot; options?)</p><br /><br /><p>Cheerio!

					<p>Hi Yarina,</p><p>That was fast!!!! :-)</p><br /><p>You mean I need to create an image myself? Is there not an image I can download somewhere to get started?</p><br /><p>BTW. I tried &quot;slugimage -u -i openwrt-ixp4xx-2.6-squashfs.img&quot; to try to extract the ramdisk and FS from the other file, but I get an error: &quot;substr outside of string at /usr/bin/slugimage line 301.&quot;</p><p>Looks there is a bug in the &quot;slugimage&quot; tool for ubuntu (8.10).</p><br /><p>Cheerio!
