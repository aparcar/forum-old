					<p>How to set up IPv6 NAT and assign fc00::/7 IPs to users?</p><p>The openwrt router has multiple IPv6 WAN and one or more routed prefix on each WAN. If I use auto configuration, all the routed prefix will be assigned to clients by DHCP. Therefore, I need to set a static IP for each LAN and enable the DHCP.</p><p>However, one of my IPv6 WAN is using 6to4 with a dynamic IP assigned by the ISP. It is not a good idea to configure static IPv6 on the router as the prefix may change. Therefore, how to set up IPv6 NAT and assign fc00::/7 IPs to users?</p>									</div>

It works. Actually, the router also has a he.net tunnel connected but that is US IP and I want the IP of my own location so I use 192.88.99.1.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kh_tsang</strong> on 2 Oct 2014, 04:01)</p>
