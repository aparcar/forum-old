					<p>I have an AMD64 PhenomII X3 system with 2GB RAM running on OpenSuSE v11.3. When I do an <em>ionice -c 3 nice -n 20 make -j 4</em>, the build still uses a single CPU to compile GCC. It is after the GCC compilation the build process started to make use all the 3 CPUs; however, the processes randomly crashes there after. If I keep repeating the process, eventually it will finish the compilation and produces a usable firmware. The crashes also happens less often if I do an <em>ionice -c 3 nice -n 20 make -j</em>, but will crash my system towards the end of the <em>make target/linux/install</em> where I see about 1700+ processes with the load average jumped to 500+. Apparently, the system performs a lot of swaps to handle thousands of cc1 processes until it rans out of swap space. Nevertheless, my question is what parameters do I need to use JUST to compile sans install. I tried <em>make compile</em> and the compilation process returns some error messages as shown below:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[mazilo@Mi:/opt/tmp/openwrt-svn-trunk 11%] ~ make compile
 make[1] compile
make -r compile: build failed. Please re-run make with V=99 to see what&#039;s going on
make: *** [compile] Error 1</code></pre></div>									</div>

On my AMD64 PhenomII X3, I noticed a <strong>make -j</strong> takes less time to complete the compilation than a <strong>make -j 4</strong>. So, it is not a silly thing to do, AFAIC. One thing I can do is to sit in front of my computer and stop the process using Ctrl-C (like you explained before) when it hits to a <em>make target/linux install</em> and then manually do a <em>make target/linux/install</em> to complete the process.</p>									</div>

Is there a way to tell <em>make</em> just to build the toolchain and compile the packages?

Did you mean once the <em>parallel menuconfig option in global build settings</em> have been enabled, all one needs is just to type <em>make</em> without the <strong>-j</strong> option to build the system multithreaded with packages single-threaded? If so, how can the build process get sped up using this approach? I have enabled a lot of big packages, i.e. all packages in Language sub-menu, asterisk, freeswitch, etc., that require a lot of CPU resources to build. If I make use of the <strong>-j</strong> option with the <em>make</em>, the build process sometimes break randomly. When that happens, I have to re-run the <em>make -j 4</em> and the process starts to scan from the beginning up to the point where it crashed before the compilation starts again. The process can take a considerable of time to go through. I guess my question to anyone here is if there is a way to guarantee <em>make -j X</em> won&#039;t randomly crash during the build process.</p>									</div>

					<p>No I meant the opposite. Once the option is enabled the system will compile big, good packages with -jX regardless of what -j option was passed to the main make invocation.</p>									</div>
