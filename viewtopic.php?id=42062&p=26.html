					<p>Hi, I`ve been reading this topic for quite a long time.<br/>Today I finally tried to build r39430 myself. I use the link of dabyd64 to get the trunk folder: &quot; svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/@r39430 &quot;</p><p>I choose the kernel modules I want (I can´t find Luci by the way) and I compile it without errors.<br/>The problem comes when I log into the router, it doesn´t recognize any interface (neither Lan, WAN or WAN6), it just shows : &quot;Collecting data...&quot; Also, when I click on the wifi configuration tab it pops the well known error saying: &quot;Bad Gateway,<br/>The process did not produce any response&quot;</p><p>So, basically, I have a router wich does everything except work as a router.<br/>I suppose there must be something that I should also compile but I can&#039;t find anywhere what it might be.</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile"/></p><p>Thank you very much</p>									</div>
