					<p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I successfully upgraded the openwrt firmware for WRT54GL. Everything works fine but suddenly the firmware corrupted and am not able to access the router now. Power, WLAN, ethernet leds are litting without any problem. So i tried to reflash the firmware as mentioned in &quot;Installing OpenWrt via TFTP&quot; and followed the steps for Windows XP/2000. I opened the ping window and tftp. I set my PC static address as 192.168.1.2 and netmask as 255.255.255.0. I executed the ping command and its displaying &quot;Destination host unreachable&quot; and when i plugin the router its displaying as &quot;Request timed out&quot;. Am not getting the &quot;Hardware error&quot; and am not able to tftp the binary file. Have anyone faced the same problem?? Please help me to overcome this problem.</p><p>Your help in this regard is greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks and regards,<br />Nagarajan</p>									</div>

					<p>You may not need to reflash.&nbsp; Try getting into failsafe mode:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting#head-ea8da2ae4781dee2abc4e642a2410735c155b71a">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Tro … 35c155b71a</a></p><p>If you can&#039;t listen on UDP ports, you should be able to do the following:</p><p>Powercycle the router.&nbsp; The power light will blink.&nbsp; As soon as the DMZ light comes on, press the reset button on the back for about two seconds.</p><p>Then try to telnet to 192.168.1.1 port 22.&nbsp; It should let you in without a password.</p><p>EDIT: I must have been half asleep when I wrote that last paragraph.&nbsp; Telnet in (no need to specify the port, but it&#039;s port 23, of course) and it should let you in without a password.</p><p>Then see this for what to do next:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting#head-1d74f4f36ec324341387b95b70c41a7c02a8f207">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Tro … 7c02a8f207</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wodin</strong> on 11 Feb 2008, 09:05)</p>
