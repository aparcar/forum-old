					<p>Hello, I bought this device and indeed it runs openwrt.&nbsp; Ssh was not installed, so I installed it through the Luci webinterface.<br />Problem: I couldn&#039;t login because I only had the username kimax and the password for this user, not the root password.</p><p>Then I took the risk to flash it with another openwrt-firmware, more specific, the one of the wrtnode as it was the same chipset ramips 7020N) and I was sure the wifi on the wrtnode works.&nbsp; So this device booted and I could connect through wifi and point my browser to the Luci webinterface.&nbsp; I expected it shouldn&#039;t work and I had to telnet first to set a password for root.&nbsp; But instead I got the luci webinterface.&nbsp; I tried with the username kimax and password to login and it worked...but I just had a white webpage without data.</p><p>So now I can&#039;t login as root and can&#039;t login as user kimax.&nbsp; I found out ssh is enabled but without root password I can&#039;t login.&nbsp; Failsafe mode seems to be disabled.<br />Is there a way to get the root password?&nbsp; As I can ssh to the device I could configure it through ssh, but then I need the root password.<br />I already tried to attack ssh with hydra, but I&#039;m not sure it really attacks as it doesn&#039;t even give an error message when I disconnect the connection.</p><p>I don&#039;t see a serial connection, but the device is made of a moherboard and daughterboard with the soc.&nbsp; There is probably a serial connection somewhere on the pins, but I have no idea how to find it.</p>									</div>

					<p>This seems to be a interesting device.&nbsp; Missing the root password without failsave is indeed tricky. <br />I will subscribe to this topic since I will buy this device if its possable to run a openwrt install without modifications from the manufacturer.</p>									</div>
