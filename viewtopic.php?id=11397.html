					<p>I&#039;m seeing some strange things on two of my Fonera&#039;s, and I&#039;m not sure if it is a hardware problem, or an OpenWRT &quot;problem&quot;</p><p>On one of my Foneras, I can write to all 8 GPIO pins without resetting the unit. Yes, strange things happen if I set both 5 and 6 to drive, and then set them to different states, but other than that, I can use 5 or 6 as a gpout, so long as I make the other an input.</p><p>I was going to use this to reset my FPGA logic (since there is a handy button right on the bottom of the board), only to find that my other Fonera IS resetting when I drive bit 5 low. </p><p>I d/l&#039;ed the 7.06 tag (the released version) and compiled it on two separate machines (one at work, the other at home), thinking that since I pulled the same branch, I should get the same image. So here&#039;s the question. Why is gp5 causing a reset on one router, and nothing on the other?</p><p>Note - I haven&#039;t pulled the cable to the FPGA boards, but bit 5 is attached to an input on both boards.</p><p>Also strange is that I can turn bit 5 into an input, turn bit 6 into an output, and drive bit 6 high or low without resetting the second unit!</p><p>Anyone else play around with this? Did the reset daemon get ported to OpenWRT, and it&#039;s actually not working right on the first router?</p><p>EDIT: I can avoid the reset by using bit 6, and making 5 an input. Very strange, but at least it lets me do what I need to do.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jshamlet</strong> on 27 Jun 2007, 05:23)</p>
