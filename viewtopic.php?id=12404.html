					<p>Switched from cable to Verizon DSL service in the bay Area. Verizon gave me this Actiontec wifi/router/modem which does not want to play with my 2 bridged (WDS) WhiteRussian wrt54g&#039;s. </p><p>I have been looking in vain for a DSL modem only solution so I could use my wrt&#039;s. Anyone in the same boat? Apparently I can only use Westell or Actiontec modems and none of them sell a modem-only solution. All come with router, firewall and some with NAT.</p><p>I need help. I love openwrt and would like to either switch the Actiontec, 704 is the model I believe, to openwrt or get a modem which will let my wrt&#039;s work.</p>									</div>

					<p>You might see if you can put your Actiontec router into bridge mode.&nbsp; Use the OpenWRT box with PPPoE or PPPoA to manage the connection.</p><p>My ActionTec M1000 can be put into that mode fairly easily.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bkloppenborg</strong> on 14 Nov 2007, 16:25)</p>
