					<p>Hi,<br />I run Whiterussian RC5 since 4 months and all is fine.<br />I got sources for Kamikaze from SVN, build them (all was fine) and installed the .trx via tftp<br />Then, I&#039;m unable to do anything with it...<br />No ping, no SSH, how to debug that??? I have no serial console. Is that hard to do? Is that the only way for debugging?</p><p>Thanks to help, I&#039;m stuck...<br />-jec</p>									</div>

					<p>Plug one of the LAN ports into another PC, and run tcpdump on that machine:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># tcpdump -i eth0 -n -s500 -X ip</code></pre></div><p>Then power up the Asus. Do you see a broadcast UDP packet, I think it&#039;s to port 4919? If so, press the reset button within 2 seconds of that, and you should get another broadcast packet confirming you&#039;re in safe mode. Then the box is on 192.168.1.1 and you should be able to telnet into it.</p><p>If not, then yes the next move would be to attach a serial port. You need an RS232 level shifter, either make one using a MAX232 chip or hack a mobile phone data cable. There&#039;s info on the Wiki about this. It&#039;s not hard, but you should not have been running Kamikaze in the first place without one (this is said over and over again)</p><p>If you were happy with WhiteRussian RC5, then perhaps you&#039;d prefer to run RC6 instead.</p>									</div>
