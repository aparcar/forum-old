					<p>Hi Everyone,<br />The problem occurred when I was trying to update the opensource firmware for TEW 712 BR, <br />the latest Opensource firmware from official trendnet website.<br />When I tried to update it through the web interface, the error message said:<br />The uploaded image file does not contain a supported format. Make sure that you choose the generic image format for your platform.<br />I thought the firmware came from official website so I used putty to force update. (sysupgrade -F). The process finished, but with a message &quot;fail to erase a block&quot;.<br />After the router restarting, the router looked like a brick, the power light only on yellow never turned to green. Other LED won&#039;t turn on.<br />If I pressed the reset then plugged in the power, the power light flashed with a pattern (flash once every 3 seconds)&nbsp; with color in yellow, I don&#039;t know what was that meaning. The LED for the connected LAN sometimes turned to green.<br />All lanes were not working, can not ping through.<br />Anyone know if this router still can be saved?<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I ran into a similar issue with a device a few month ago.&nbsp; I forgot to un-zip the before try to update the device. There should be a recovery process on the web site.&nbsp; Try using the recovery process and return it to the default state.&nbsp; If that does not work call the vendor they may have a process that can fix it.</p>									</div>
