					<p>I&#039;ll try to simplify things as possible. I won&#039;t describe scenarios when router has separate eth1 port for WAN. In this case I suggest stop using it and use one of the LAN ports for WAN connection. This way you can use switch functions to separate vlans without use of router&#039;s CPU and complex configuration. Unused WAN eth1 you can bridge to br-lan and use it as local port.</p><p>Lets suppose switch has ports 0,1,2,3 visible as LAN connectors and port 5 bound to cpu.<br />Exact configuration of your switch you can take from wiki on your device.</p><p>Lets use port 0 as WAN, port 1 as IPTV.<br />Suppose IPTV come from VLAN 88, PPPoE from VLAN 89.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch

Just like in my case, I also use x86-64 build of openwrt there&#039;s no switch interface in luci that I can use to manage the VLAN setting on the switch because there&#039;s no switch to begin with, only 2 physical network interface cards facing in WAN and LAN.</p><p>so to get it working, I just followed what said here<br /><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VLAN">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VLAN</a></p><p>and with that. I was able to create 2 VLAN interface, 1 for IPTV and 1 for internet.<br />Since I had a 3 NICs installed I paired the IPTV VLAN interface and eth2 for my IPTV (just plain bridge no fancy routing stuff) the rest is I paired my Internet VLAN as my WAN interface and eth1 to my br-lan.</p><p>I can make this simple with only 2 NIC but I dont have a manage switch here so I just gone for the getto work around.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 31 Jan 2016, 15:10)</p>
