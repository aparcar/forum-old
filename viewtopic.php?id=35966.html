					<p>Hi,</p><p>I installed Openwrt/Backfire on my Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 last week and it works nicely in AP mode.&nbsp; However, I was trying to set it up as client (192.168.1.10) to access my verizon DSL router (192.168.1.1) by closely following the instructions in this article <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedclient</a>.&nbsp; I could not make it work.&nbsp; It appears that it can connect to the DSL router but it&#039;s not getting the IP address needed. Therefore &quot;ping 192.168.1.1&quot; from Openwrt never returns.</p><p>I tried many different things but nothing helped.&nbsp; One idea was that perhaps it has to use DHCP instead of static IP on the client side.&nbsp; I tried it and almost lost access to the router because once I make it DHCP, the router&#039;s IP is lost.&nbsp; Fortunately I made the Wan port static IP so I was able to access using cable.&nbsp; But still no luck with getting IP from the DSL router.&nbsp; I tried the LUCI interface and couldn&#039;t make it work either.&nbsp; When I scan and join the DSL router, it will create the &quot;wwan&quot; interface (not sure why) which doesn&#039;t connect.&nbsp; If I use the &quot;lan&quot; interface, it connects but not getting the IP address.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
