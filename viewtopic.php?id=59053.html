					<p>Hello guys ! </p><p>First of all, thank you for reading my post ! </p><p>I need router for small business enterprise which can support 30 sync connections. For some reasons, I need it to source it straight from China and have some software already pre-installed on it when I receive it.. I mean nothing to hide but you know better than me all of this stuff <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> !<br />So, basically I cannot buy some stuff like TP Link or whatever just from Amazon because it will take me forever to configure each router manually =&#039;( !</p><p>I bought some sample with those chipset MT7620N and MT7620A, and I got an awesome router looking great but it did not work pretty much ... <br />The hardware seems hard to manage and it&#039;s not convenient to upgrade the firmware as I pleased since it&#039;s a Chinese version from OpenWRT.com.cn ...</p><p>So, I turned my mind about this manufacturer and I have been thinking about getting something more stable such as :</p><p>- Qualcomm Atheros or Broadcomm such as BCM4718 or others... I need a chipset that can manage 30 sync connexions !<br />- FLASH: minimum 8M <br />- SDRAM: minimum 32M<br />- 300 mbps<br />- 2 or 3 antennas<br />- Wireless 802.11n</p><p>I do not need a dual band AC and N because I will use it as HotSpot so it does not make any sense to provide 2 hotspot wifi I prefer to focus on a good chipset.</p><p>Also, I saw a check test of Linksys WRT610N&nbsp; ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt610n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt610n</a> ) and it seems to be the greatest product on the market in my range price.</p><p>My budget turn around $30-40, I want something stable and reliable that can last forever as everyone&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ! I am quite sure that a router is waiting for me but it seems to be quite hard to find exactly what I need or even make a suggestion since I do not know which chipset might be the best fitted for my case.</p><p>If you have any suggestion about a manufacturer or even just a recommendation or a chipset ... I will appreciation all your suggestion.</p><p>Thank you !</p>									</div>

					<p>Go for a TP-Link TL-WDR3600.</p><p>I am using it for development and writing my IPV6 experiments.<br />There are probably many others ...</p><p>The only issue in production is that it is a Chinese router.<br />So don&#039;t use it in a research center or in any large company.<br />It is probably suitable for SOHO use.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gnutella</strong> on 15 Aug 2015, 22:03)</p>

					<p>Thank you Gnutella ! <br />It seems to be great shoot ! I will make more research about that but it&#039;s still an AC mode router, isn&#039;t ?</p><p>The chipset using by WRT-3600 is AR9344 from Qualcomm right ?</p>									</div>
