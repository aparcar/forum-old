What I did was:<br />(1) ipkg install kmod-brcm-wl wlc (these were missing on my unit, and without them &quot;wifi up&quot; gave odd errors about broadcom not being supported)<br />(2) vi /etc/config/network</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
config interface lan
        option type     bridge
        option ifname   &quot;eth0.0&quot;
        option proto    dhcp
...</code></pre></div><p>(3) vi /etc/config/wireless</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device      wl0
        option type     broadcom
        option channel  5
        option disabled 0
config wifi-iface
        option device   wl0

        option encryption wep
        option key      1122334455</code></pre></div><p>With this, the unit itself was able to join the wireless network. Then, plugging a laptop into a LAN port, I was able to pick up an IP address from the same network. tcpdump on another machine showed the Broadcast flag had been set in the DHCP request; and looking at the ARP cache on another machine, I could see the same MAC address for both the OpenWrt box and the laptop:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ arp -an
? (10.69.255.103) at 00:16:01:4B:6D:6D [ether] on eth0    # &lt;&lt; the OpenWrt box
? (10.69.255.102) at 00:16:01:4B:6D:6D [ether] on eth0    # &lt;&lt; the laptop</code></pre></div><p>So all in all, this has all been implemented completely.</p><p>Question: is this just enabling the existing functionality in the closed Broadcom 2.4 driver? Which means it may not be available to Atheros users, and/or may be lost when we move to a 2.6 Broadcom driver?</p><p>Regards, Brian.</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, apparently it was the funny settings on the gateway AP with WR0.9. The mode will not work if the system you are connecting to is working with both psk and psk2 (not just the client should be using only one of them!) and also the funny &quot;both&quot; settings I have won&#039;t work either.
