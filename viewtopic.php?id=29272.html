					<p>I have both a WRT54GL and a TEW-652BRP and I am trying to set them up so that each Ethernet port has its own network interface. In other words, since both devices have 5 ports, I am trying to have 5 OS virtual network interfaces. My hosts will not support 802.1Q tagging, so it must be transparent. The wiki and other threads seem ambiguous about certain things (8021.Q required?), contradictory (due to time written no doubt), and outright confusing.</p><p>What is the proper values for <em>/etc/config/network</em>? Both devices are running trunk from December 2010.</p><p>This is the current <em>/etc/config/network</em> from the WRT54GL:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### VLAN configuration

					<p>I am not sure if i understand well your point. <br />There is single CPU related ETH. port connected directly to switch chip.&nbsp; IP address is handled by OS but not by port.

					<p>I should limit this to the WRT54GL because it is so well documented. I am assuming the wiki is right and everyone else is outdated, and use &quot;t&quot; instead of &quot;*&quot;... So:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch_vlan eth0_0
    option device   &quot;eth0&quot;
    option vlan     0
    option ports    &quot;4 5&quot;

    option vlan     1
    option ports    &quot;3 5t&quot;

config switch_vlan eth0_2
    option device   &quot;eth0&quot;
    option vlan     2
    option ports    &quot;2 5t&quot;

config switch_vlan eth0_3
    option device   &quot;eth0&quot;
    option vlan     3
    option ports    &quot;1 5t&quot;

config switch_vlan eth0_4
    option device   &quot;eth0&quot;
    option vlan     4
    option ports    &quot;0 5t&quot;</code></pre></div><p>should mean that every port has its own &quot;internal VLAN&quot;, ie. eth0.N, correct?</p><p>Internally, packets from the CPU to any particular port/VLAN device (they should be synonymous) will be encapsulated, and everything else not. I assume &quot;out that port&quot; from the wiki means towards the wire and away from the CPU (&quot;out&quot; should not be used with two-way channels), and that the non-CPU network processor strips the encapsulation, so that no tagging hits the wire. (None of this is mentioned in the wiki AFAIK, leading to confusion heaped upon confusion for me.) Also, I assume type &quot;bridge&quot; means <em>the bridge</em>, to which the wireless will be attached, not just a bridge. (I assume all of this will continue to get assumed by most others for quite sometime, until I (1) find out the answer and (2) update the wiki.)</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>JaromirN wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>IP address is handled by OS but not by port.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>&nbsp; hmm. i can&#039;t discuss directly your model (router). I have different one. Also my experience is - documentation isn&#039;t always correct. <br />Strongly depends on switch chip and which release of OW you have. There is development still running.. <br />&nbsp; I remember some troubles with VLAN 0 also problem with order of setting - check WIKI - there is mentioned something about it. Also some information i found in TRAC (bugs).. </p><p>&nbsp; I am not sure if your switch device is correct (def missing in your list). Mostly it is name of the switch chip. For example - i have very easy solution:</p><br /><p>config &#039;switch&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;-- def switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;name&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-- do you have what name here?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;reset&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;enable_vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-- enabled</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;-- common 4 ports defined as single VLAN (2)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;1&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;1 2 3 4 5t&#039;</p><p>config &#039;switch_vlan&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-- WAN port separated to another VLAN (2)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;device&#039; &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;vlan&#039; &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ports&#039; &#039;0 5t&#039;</p><br /><p>It is important to know you port numbering.. WAN port isn&#039;t always port 0. Also sometime there is physically more ports than 4+(WAN)+(CPU)&nbsp; Some chips have 7 or 8 ports but not all of them are wired out.</p>									</div>
