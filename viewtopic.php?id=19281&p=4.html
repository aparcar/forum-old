I did a bit of further testing and as it seems, r24920 is actually very unstable on my D4 -&nbsp; the wireless interface will regularly freeze up for a 30 seconds or a minute and may require manual resetting. The freezing seems to be a regression as it&#039;s a lot worse than with r23074. With r23074 it still happens but at least it recovered itself in ~3 seconds most times. Seems to be caused by a rapid change in signal levels (bad rate control?). Not had time to change the rate control algorithms, but setting the transmit power higher (i.e. to max) reduced the problem for me. Running the command &quot;wifi&quot; restores things when the wireless freezes up, without needing a reboot. Anyhow the driver seems a little unstable, but seems to at least work (for me) without modification.</p><p>On D4 both r23074 and r24920 are slow and CPU utilization is high (~65mbps actual throughput, load average &gt;3.0) but at least 23074 seems more stable. I&#039;ve uploaded my old build here - give it a try, as it works slightly better for me:</p><p><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=VV46TS28">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=VV46TS28</a></p><p>Same warning as before (for everyone else) - D2 units may have problems with the ethernet interface.</p><p>Well anyway, it&#039;s far from perfect and the wireless driver is still unstable but when it&#039;s working it&#039;ll connect at &#039;N&#039; speeds and transmit data at &#039;N&#039; speeds for me, though nowhere near as fast as it should. I&#039;ve not tried recently the D2 as I can&#039;t even get it to connect to an ethernet switch properly so can&#039;t configure it or transmit data through it once flashed with openwrt &gt;_&lt;</p><p>What client device are you using by the way?

					<p>Yeah, I&#039;ve got the same problem with the LAN ports on a D2, looks like D1 and D2 are both affected but D4 isn&#039;t.

I can&#039;t figure out how to get the old revisions out of svn, but then I&#039;ve never used svn before now.</p>									</div>
