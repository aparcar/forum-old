					<p>Hi,<br />I created some VLANs on my OpenWrt (Attitude Adjustment 12.09 ) box (Netgear WNDR3700) and I want to keep them isolated like this:<br />VLAN 1 - it is allowed to go on the internet via multiple ports<br />VLAN 2 - it is allowed to go on the internet but only one port is open (can be the port of voip, ssh etc.)<br />VLAN 3 - guest wireless can go on the internet via multiple ports<br />VLAN 4 - only VPN server goes out on vpn port<br />VLAN 5 - never goes on the internet<br />The port opening/blocking for VLANs 1 to 4 is done by the firewall <br /><strong> BUT </strong><br /><span style="color: blue"> for VLAN 5 I want something more: VLAN 5 should not only be blocked to go on the internet by the firewall, but it should not even know how to go to internet. This is why it should have no route outside. <br />On the other hand, I want that some VPN clients tunnel into the VLAN 5 and access all the machines as if they are local. </span></p><p>What I did is the following:<br />- created VLANs with LuCI<br />- created corresponding interfaces with LUCI<br />- configured DHCP server to assigns specific IPs to different machines based on MAC addresses.&nbsp; <br />- logged in with SSH and deleted VLAN 5 route in rc.local <br /><strong> ip route del 10.5.0.0/24 dev eth0.5 </strong><br />- set up VPN server and user config file to assign a fixed IP to one of the clients</p><p>At this point I got lost (frustrated, desperate, confused) because the VPN connection is not possible. From the client log it can be seen that the client tries something [UDPV4 WRITE to server IP:port: P_CONTROL_HARD_RESET_CLIENT_V2 .... ], the server acknowledges and answers back [UDPV4 WRITE to client:IP:port: P_CONTROL_HARD_RESET_SERVER_V2 .... ],&nbsp; but the answer never reaches the client so that the client tries again indefinitely to send the same reset message.</p><p>Could anyone, please, point me to what I have done wrong?</p><p>First of all, is there a flaw in the following reasoning:<br />1. DHCP server can put a machine in VLAN 5 based on its MAC address ?<br />2. delete VLAN 5 route via rc.local and OpenWrt will not know how to reach it ? Is it enough or the OpenWrt will know it anyway? <br />3. can it be something wrong with the gateway of the VLAN 4? should I explicitely put a route into the VPN server config file so that it knows how to go out of VLAN and reach the ISP gateway?<br />If I could manage to connect to VPN server I could continue to work on the tunneling from VLAN 4 to VLAN 5 but at this moment the problem is that I cannot have a&nbsp; working VPN connection to server.<br />Any ideas?</p><p>here are the settings which might be relevant:</p><p><strong> routes </strong><br />Destination&nbsp; &nbsp; Gateway&nbsp; &nbsp; Flags&nbsp; &nbsp; Metric&nbsp; &nbsp; Ref&nbsp; &nbsp; Use&nbsp; &nbsp; Iface<br />0.0.0.0/0 &nbsp; &nbsp; ISP gateway &nbsp; &nbsp; UG&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; eth1<br />10.1.0.0/30 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; U&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.1<br />10.2.0.0/24 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; U&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.2<br />10.3.0.0/24 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; U&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.3<br />10.4.0.0/24 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; U&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; tun0<br /><strong> <span class="bbu"> 10.5.0.0/24 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; U&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.5 </span> </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; gets deleted after boot<br />IP.ISP....0/22 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; U&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; eth1</p><br /><p><strong> openvpn config file </strong><br />dev tun<br />server 10.4.0.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 255.255.255.0<br />push-route 10.5.0.0 255.255.255.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; #advertise VLAN 5<br />route 10.4.1.0 255.255.255.0&nbsp; &nbsp; #assign virtual IP for client 1 to be handled further by iptables<br />route 10.4.2.0 255.255.255.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; #assign virtual IP for client 2 to be handled further by iptables<br />client-config-dir &nbsp; &nbsp; etc/openvpn/ccd</p><br /><p><strong> client config file ccd </strong><br />ifconfig-push 10.4.1.1 10.4.1.2</p><br /><p><strong> firewall.user </strong><br />#Allow TUN interface connections to OpenVPN server<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT<br />#Allow TUN interface connections to be forwarded through other interfaces<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT<br />#Allow client 1 to tunnel into VLAN 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -s 10.4.1.0/24 -d 10.5.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT</p>									</div>
