					<p>metai:<br />Now I got your angle completely.</p><p>About a unified table format for the detail pages.

Just keep the title at &#039;Wireless&#039; or something similar. You don&#039;t need to put 802.11b/g/n/ac everywhere, regular users know what b/g/n/ac means even without the 802.11 prefix.

The Table of Hardware overview can be concise, however, I would still mention:<br />- Gigabit or Fast Ethernet switch.

					<p>The target column... I am quite happy with it now.</p><p>brcm-2.4 brcm47xx: I like the Warning Notice about 16MB devices with brcm47xx target may be better to install 10.03.1 and brcm-2.4. So from my perspective we could remove the brcm-2.4 information. But perhaps then people are tempted to install brcm-2.4 on routers that never were supported by 2.4.</p><p>ramips: can someone explain what is going on? The folder structure is not the same in BB and trunk (and BB makes more sense, to me). In trunk many targets are hidden in generic. These seem to be important targets. Why are ramips put in one folder/target, while mpc are allowed to have several targets with almost no supported hardware. And Broadcom. I would be fine with:<br /> 1) getting rid of the ramips thing, and let all subtargets be real targets (at root level)<br /> 2) committing to either the trunk or the BB subtarget structure<br />But I don&#039;t know anything about ramips. And I don&#039;t intend to ask the hard working developers to change stuff just so it gets easier for me to clean up a column <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Another thing...
