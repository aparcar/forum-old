					<p><strong>For those having WIFI issues with openwrt firmware and Apple devices; I suggest you read this story. It could save you from data overage charges if a cell device is switched from home WIFI to a cell tower because of a crappy WIFI connection. (WRT1900AC openwrt &amp; Belkin driver issues)</strong></p><p>An article was posted by CBC NEWS online (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) <a href="http://cbc.ca/news">http://cbc.ca/news</a> .</p><p><strong>&quot;Apple iOS 9 feature Wi-Fi Assist could lead to huge iPhone bills</strong>&quot; here:</p><p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/apple-ios-9-wifi-assist-1.3248364">http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/apple … -1.3248364</a></p><p>The article:</p><p><em>If you&#039;ve upgraded to iOS 9, you should be aware that it comes with a new feature – enabled by default – that could make your next wireless bill a lot bigger.</em></p><p><em>Wi-Fi Assist automatically switches your phone from Wi-Fi to a cellular connection when the Wi-Fi signal is poor. That&#039;s helpful if you&#039;re in the middle of watching a video or some other task on the internet that you don&#039;t want interrupted by spotty Wi-Fi service.</em></p><p><em>&quot;But this also means eating through your 500 MB data cap without knowing it,&quot; warns the IT department at McGill University in Montreal, which suggests that users may want to disable Wi-Fi Assist.</em></p><p><em>The new feature means you may be consuming data from your data plan at times when you think you&#039;re on Wi-Fi. If your data plan isn&#039;t unlimited, that may result in overage charges – in Canada, that&#039;s typically five cents per megabyte or $15 per 300 MB that you go over your data cap. (300 MB is what&#039;s required to stream a movie for 45 minutes, according to Bell&#039;s data calculator).</em></p><p><em>Chris Mills, a writer for the technology site Gizmodo, wrote that since he started testing the beta version of iOS 9, his data usage has increased by around a third.</em></p><p><em>&quot;It&#039;s impossible to say if that extra usage is directly related to Wi-Fi Assist, but I have my suspicions,&quot; wrote Mills Tuesday.</em></p><p><em>He noted that during the past three days, his data usage has been 950 MB, and half is from Netflix, which he only used at home &quot;using what I thought was WiFi.&quot;</em></p><p><em>So how do you turn Wi-Fi Assist off?<br />■Go into Settings.<br />■Choose Cellular.<br />■Scroll way down to Wi-Fi Assist.<br />■Switch the slider to the &quot;off&quot; position.</em></p><p>Rick</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RickStep</strong> on 29 Sep 2015, 23:46)</p>
