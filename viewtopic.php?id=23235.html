					<p>The behavior of mjpg-streamer has changed sometime in the past 6 weeks.&nbsp; Prior to that time, when you built it in or installed it as a package, a directory, /webcam_www was installed.&nbsp; This contained various programs which could be invoked.&nbsp; To run it, you had to issue a command like &#039;mjpg_streamer -i &quot;input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0 -r 640x480&quot; -o &quot;output_http.so -p 8080 -w /webcam_www&quot;&amp;&#039;.</p><p>Now the configuration is in /etc/config/mjpg-streamer, which would seem good in itself, but where are the options documented?&nbsp; Just streaming seems not to work:&nbsp; I tried <a href="http://192.168.1.60:8080">http://192.168.1.60:8080</a> and got nothing.&nbsp; Snapshot does work: <a href="http://192.168.1.60:8080/?action=snapshot">http://192.168.1.60:8080/?action=snapshot</a></p><p>I had the old /webcam_www, so I did /etc/init.d/mjpg-streamer disable, copied in /webcam_www and started the old way: <a href="http://192.168.1.60:8080">http://192.168.1.60:8080</a></p><p>This gave me streaming video.&nbsp; It would be nice to have such a change documented, but the wiki doesn&#039;t have an entry for &quot;mjpg-streamer&quot;.&nbsp; Is there someplace which gives what the options are in the config file or what the uci commands are to control the uvc webcam?</p>									</div>

					<p>The options which are included in /etc/config/mjpg-streamer are self explanatory, but what about the one&#039;s which are omitted?&nbsp; How does one &quot;stream&quot; with this &quot;streamer&quot; as set up?&nbsp; There may be a way, but it isn&#039;t laid out.&nbsp; It would help, in a case like this, if the config file included a &quot;#default&quot; section in which the defaults for other options were shown.</p>									</div>
