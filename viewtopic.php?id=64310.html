					<p>Most of the LuCI interface for working with wireless nodes uses the SSID that I set.&nbsp; However, the Status -&gt; Realtime Graphs -&gt; Traffic screen shows wlan0, wlan0-1, wlan0-2, wlan0-3....</p><p>And, in LuCI, I have not found a way to find the wlan name associated with each ssid.&nbsp; They don&#039;t each have their own interface, so that screen doesn&#039;t help.&nbsp; The Network -&gt; wifi screen doesn&#039;t show the wlan name.</p>									</div>
