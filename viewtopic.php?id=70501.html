I disabled DHCP under the lan interface, and manually set the address &quot;192.168.1.2&quot;. I then enabled the bgn radio.</p><p>(Note that router A is at 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0, and B is now at 192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0).</p><p>Upon enabling router B, it shows up on router A under &quot;Associated Stations.&quot; Clearly the two are communicating -- somehow.

Connecting to router B, I&#039;m unable to ping 192.168.1.1.</p><p>I&#039;m expecting router A to act as a Master, and router B to work as a Slave -- and to be able to configure and add any number of additional &quot;router Bs&quot; to mesh network to expand the connection to A (and the internet.) As-is, though, I don&#039;t receive DHCP via B, and can&#039;t seem to reach 192.168.1.1, let alone the internet.</p><p>Any idea what else is necessary to get 802.11s set up?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks again, mk24. I managed to get 802.11s (unencrypted) working via 2.4 GHz this evening.</p><p>So far, I&#039;ve been unable to make 5 GHz mesh work. I&#039;m using the ath10k-ct driver and firmware--might that be the problem? So far, I have a 2.4 GHz access interface + 2.4 GHz mesh interface, and now I&#039;ve added a 5 GHz access interface + 5 GHz mesh interface. Perhaps I cannot have two mesh interfaces running concurrently? Perhaps 802.11s, the driver, or the firmware cannot do 80 MHz width, and I need to use 40, or 20?</p><p>I&#039;m going to try the base ath10k driver, but I&#039;m curious what your settings may have been to get 5 GHz working in the first place, even without encryption?

					<p>I use the regular ath10k on my 6100&#039;s.&nbsp; The Candela may be better for some things like an AP, but using it even as a client on the 6100 hardware caused an immediate crash.</p><p>You don&#039;t need to run two meshes.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t improve speed any.&nbsp; Generally you would have a mesh on one band as the &quot;backbone&quot; link between your access points, and the users would be on the other band.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did switch to the regular ath10k driver &amp; firmware, but wasn&#039;t able to get the 5 GHz to mesh.

					<p>Thanks for the suggestion, greybeard. I will do so -- but before I do, if mk24 doesn&#039;t see this, I&#039;ll try to reach out.</p><p>mk24, you indicated that you got 11s working via ath10k without encryption. Was your implementation limited to VHT20 as well? I&#039;ve tested both the stock (17.0.1) and Candela Tech drivers/firmware. Even if encryption is not supported on 11s by ath10k, the poor performance of VHT20 on ath10k wouldn&#039;t make it worthwhile anyway.</p><p>But, I did see (in searching the forum) that you appear to be using 17.0.2, and you might have different drivers/firmware/implementation. Are your results any different than mine?</p><p>Ultimately, I was hoping to run a 11s mesh on both ath9k and ath10k with the same mesh_id, so the router(s) could auto-negotiate the best performance. Close enough, and they could use ath10k for additional speed--farther away, and they&#039;d use the ath9k link. (I purchased a few of these because of their price right now (less than $20) and 128/128 rom/flash memory, which seems incredibly generous, so I&#039;ll be using them for mesh networking as well as some other friends, and each will be placing routers around their homes at their own discretion, which is what drives me to configure them to perform the best they can, given wherever they end up.)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Shidell</strong> on 8 Apr 2017, 06:55)</p>
