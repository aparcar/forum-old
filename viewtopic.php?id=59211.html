					<p>Hi there,</p><p>probably this question has been asked before. Neither my searching or the possible answers could solve my problem. So here is my try...</p><p>I have several wrt boxes running as Accesspoints, VPN routers or DHCP server on my network. The internet access is done by a AVM Fritzbox which obviously cannot be fully configured.</p><p>The Fritzbox is only the gateway while DNS and DHCP are handled by a T-Com W303V running 15.03. In v4 this is perfect world as I provide static addresses via dnsmasq and custom DNS at will. For v6 I&#039;d love to have the same.</p><p>The problem... T-Com provides a dynamic /56 which the Fritz is announcing to the internal network. I have DHCPv6 disabled with M and O flag set. Clients are now looking for a DHCPv6 server.</p><p>Goal:<br />- WRT box get address and prefix from fritz<br />- Optionally open a subnet for DHCP (split /56 into a /64)<br />- Provide DNS server address and other useful stuff to clients via DHCPv6</p><p>Problems:<br />I can&#039;t get the br-lan interface (which is IPv4 static) to obtain the IPv6 from the Fritzbox. I can configure it manually, but that won&#039;t recognize a prefix change through re-dialin. Also the odhcpd never starts or does send nothing to the network. So my client is sending a DHCP request to ff02 but doesn&#039;t get DNS configured.</p><p>I have been running a Sixxs tunnel but I see no sense in having traffic routed through a tunnel when you could go native.</p><p>Or should I use the sixxs tunnel for incoming traffic and static configuration but set the gateway using the fe80 address of the Fritz?</p><p>I think this should be a very common scenario. So perhaps others have ideas already.</p>									</div>
