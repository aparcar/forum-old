If you saved the root password on the login screen and its showing up in the Wifi auth key area then you&#039;ll have to remove the saved password from your browser and this will clear up the issue.

The WAN interface is setup to use DHCP, and it works fine with the latest version of McWrt AA (12.09.1 | Load: 1.17 1.19 1.11 ). I tried to compare all of the network and interface settings, but I must be missing something. As a result, I&#039;ve had to revert back to McWrt AA, but I&#039;d really like to be using CC as that seems to be the way ahead. Any help would be greatly appreciated - thanks!</p>									</div>
