					<p>I have an Openwrt router with an nonHilink LTE usb modem as WAN. The modem is just a modem, not a router! (special firmware). The Pi is located on the roof, for a better LTE connection. In my flat I have a secondary Asus router which manages all my Internet traffic.<br />Because of problems with that bridge, I will&nbsp; change the Pi from Bridge Modus to normal Router Modus but I still want to use my Asus router to do all traffic belongings.<br />Since now, I have bridged the external WAN IP to the Asus router, and the Asus router managed my VPN Connections, WLAN, DHCP and Firewall.</p><p>Asus has a DDNS Address and ingoing VPN connections. </p><p>Now I need to forward the VPN and DDNS traffic from openwrt to the asus router. How shall I do that? Shall I use DMZ or just port forwarding? Can I Forward everything or shall I just Forward certain ports?</p><p>I could also use the BananaPi for VPN and DDNS and my asus router just as WLAN Access Point. Do you hhing the Pi ist faster then my asus ac66u router?</p><p>How can I protect VPN keys on the SDcard in the Pi? If anyone gets to the Pi and takes the sdcard, I dont want them to get to my VPN keys!<br />Is there any way to encrypt the openwrt files?</p><p>greetings</p>									</div>
