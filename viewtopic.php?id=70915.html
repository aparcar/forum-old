					<p>I configured my router to work with OpenVPN. Currently, all of my client (lan, wifi) are forwarded with OpenVPN.

See OpenVPN MAN page <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/65-openvpn-20x-manpage.html">https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-sour … npage.html</a> and search for &quot;redirect-gateway&quot; to find the details.</p><p>If this is the case, then you might want to look first at this OpenVPN instruction page on how to ignore this setting: <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/IgnoreRedirectGateway">https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/w … ectGateway</a></p><p>After ignoring the setting you&#039;d need to remove the forwarding rules in your OpenWRT config, and replace them with explicit routing rules that direct all outgoing traffic arriving from the LAN and &quot;Encrypted&quot; SSID WLAN to the VPN tunnel, while all outgoing traffic arriving from the new &quot;Unencrypted&quot; SSID WLAN you&#039;re about to create should be routed to the WAN.</p><p>Last but not least, you need to add routing and filtering rules to the WAN interface so traffic can come back, too.</p><p>Sounds like a complicated setup, but with lots of manual-reading and careful planning, it can be pulled off <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

There are no firewall rules allowing traffic to pass from this zone towards WAN, or towards any other zone for that matter. There is a forwarding rule which allows traffic from &quot;LAN + Encrypted SSID&quot; to pass to the &quot;Encryption&quot; zone. I am somewhat unsure if your OpenVPN client can even reach the OpenVPN target server. If it can, then there must be something, somewhere, which puts the OpenVPN client into a suitable zone for this purpose, or a configuration tidbit which is too permissive so traffic works even when it shouldn&#039;t.</p><p>When I read through the UCI documentation regarding firewalls (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#zone_declaration_for_semi_non-uci_interfaces_manually_listed_in_the_network_config_and_forwardings">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewa … orwardings</a>), there was some ambiguity on what the &quot;FORWARD&quot; accept option in the zone configuration does. Earlier in the documentation it says this option allows forwarding traffic between interfaces assigned to this zone, but later on in the same doc, there is an example which says that this option enables traffic to be forwarded <strong>between zones</strong>.</p><p>If the latter is true, then your firewall config is way too permissive for the intention you are trying to achieve. If the latter is not true, then the OpenVPN client should not be able to initiate communication with the OpenVPN server at all. In your first post, you stated that a connection was already being established, so perhaps the &#039;push redirect-gateway&#039; command from the OpenVPN server was doing much more than anticipated?</p>									</div>
