					<p>I thought that loading scsi_mod, sg and sd_mod would give me these, but no.<br />Instead loading those gives you device nodes like /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2.</p><p>What _is_ needed is ohci-hcd in addition to ehci-hcd.<br />Then the device can be mounted - but (because of ohci-hcd) only used at USB-1.1 speeds.</p><p>Looking for a solution to the problem that a High-Speed-Device is recognized, but not used as such, brought me here.<br />Always the OHCI-Controller is used which results in low speeds.<br />My specific problem is a HUB which is High-Speed capable - but only uses Full-Speed.<br />Connecting the HDD directly to the USB-Port of the WGT634U gives me High-Speed.<br />I need the HUB though - to connect a sound card. The WGT634U onl has got one USB-Port.<br />Problem with cheap hardware (HUB)?</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>
