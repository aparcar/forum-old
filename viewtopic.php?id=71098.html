					<p>I hope you guys can help me. I have struggled my way through every step of this. I can usually figure things out but this is just a bit beyond me.</p><p>Basically I want to make 2 separate networks with my Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH router. I managed to get OpenWrt (Chaos_Calmer) installed on it and have been fumbling through google trying to figure out how to do the VLAN&#039;s</p><p>Basically I went to Network/Switch and added a VLAN<br />on #1, set Port 0 &amp; 4 off and 1,2,3 to &#039;untagged&#039; &amp; CPU to &#039;tagged&#039;<br />on #2 set Port 0 to &#039;untagged&#039;, 1,2,3,4 off &amp; CPU to &#039;tagged&#039; as well</p><p>Then went to Network/Interfaces and added a new interface<br />Set the static IPv4 address to 192.168.2.1 &amp; IPv4 netmask to 255.255.255.0<br />Turned DHCP Server on<br />Under physical settings I selected VLAN Interface &quot;eth0.2&quot;<br />Under firewall settings selected the &#039;lan&#039; firewall zone.</p><p>That all seemed to work. I have 2 computers plugged into ports 1 &amp; 4 on the router and internet coming into the WAN port. Both have internet access &amp; the IP addresses seem correct (192.168.1.xxx for one and 192.168.2.xxx for the other). I tried to ping each of them and it was a 100% loss.</p><p>So does that sound right? Did I miss any important steps? Is there any other way to confirm the 2 computers can&#039;t talk to each other at all?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, everything looks right; both networks will remain isolated from each other, unless you allow it explicitly.</p>									</div>
