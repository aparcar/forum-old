					<p>Hi all,</p><p>My Homehub5 has been running DD for exactly a year without a blip. Last night I thought I&#039;d give it some update lovin&#039; for the latest versions of LUCI and OpenVPN that I&#039;ve been setting up over the last week or two. This in turn led me to try and install some modules (fwbuilder) that need a 4.4.14 kernel - I&#039;m still on 4.4.7.</p><p>I fired up my build PC and refreshed the packages etc and the build failed at musl-1.1.14 which googling showed was down to an out of date source tree. I updated the code from git and now get &#039;kernel too large&#039; messages.</p><p>Just in case I&#039;d goofed I cloned a whole new distribution from git, ran make defconfig which produced these errors:</p><p>tmp/.config-package.in:52691:error: recursive dependency detected!<br />tmp/.config-package.in:52691:&nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_iptables is selected by PACKAGE_vpnbypass<br />tmp/.config-package.in:77355:&nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_vpnbypass depends on PACKAGE_ip<br />tmp/.config-package.in:57835:&nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_ip is selected by PACKAGE_luci-mod-freifunk-community<br />tmp/.config-package.in:33383:&nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_luci-mod-freifunk-community depends on PACKAGE_libuci<br />tmp/.config-package.in:32100:&nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_libuci is selected by PACKAGE_firewall<br />tmp/.config-package.in:221:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_firewall is selected by PACKAGE_luci-app-firewall<br />tmp/.config-package.in:33740:&nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_luci-app-firewall is selected by PACKAGE_luci-app-p2pblock<br />tmp/.config-package.in:34033:&nbsp; &nbsp;symbol PACKAGE_luci-app-p2pblock depends on PACKAGE_iptables</p><p>the only packages out of those I have selected is iptables, firewall and luci-app-firewall. Ran make menuconfig to try and see why it thinks I have vpnbypass selected and noticed the lantiq device now only has &#039;default&#039; as a profile, no other options. Let it build anyway and it&#039;s trying to build for a TDW8970 router?</p><p>Baffled. I notice LEDE has a download for the Homehub5 so is it dead as far as OpenWRT is concerned?</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Witchy</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, a bit further on. I&#039;ve solved the recursive package problem by removing feeds/packages/net/vpnbypass/*</p><p>There&#039;s no profile selections for the HH5A because target/linux/lantiq/xrx200/profiles only has a default entry in despite there being a dts entry and LED configurations etc, so I copied the bt.mk config from my old source tree and called it 01-bt.mk to match the naming scheme. Deleted everything in tmp/.* and reran make defconfig and menuconfig which gives me the right info in the profile selection.</p><p>Yay.</p><p>I still get a TDW8970 (tp link?) build and &#039;kernel too big&#039; errors. I guess I&#039;m the only one doing this now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>W</p>									</div>
