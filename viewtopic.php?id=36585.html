					<p>I have added a section about <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/evaluation.boards/PB44#overclocking">overclocking</a> to the PB44 wiki page that I created a few weeks ago. I am running mine at 720 MHz (default 680) and with 66 MHz PCI bus (default 33). I also included information on how to push it to 760 or 800 MHz, including increasing CAS latency on the DDR to 3 (default 2.5) for increased RAM stability. The 760/800 configs are not stable on my router, though I have two more PB44&#039;s I could test with.</p><p>I also added information about some <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/evaluation.boards/pb44#hardware.mods">GPIO mods</a>, including making use of the LED&#039;s on the RS232-TTL converter board and adding I2C devices.</p><p>I had also previously added information on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/evaluation.boards/pb44#leds">making use of some LED&#039;s</a> that are not accessible in the default images, such as the &quot;PWR&quot; LED, and the second LED (other half of the dual LED) for each Mini-PCI slot. I use this information to build support for these LED&#039;s into my own images.</p><p>I hope this is interesting to some PB44 users, and even to users of other routers using AR7161/AR71XX CPU. If you try overclocking your PB44, post the results here.</p><p>If anyone else has done, or thought about doing, any interesting hacks to/with their PB44, post details here.</p>									</div>
