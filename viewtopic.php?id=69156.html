					<p>Hi sergio83 - yes. As a new member of the forum, you&#039;re not allowed to post links. (This is a self-defense mechanism against drive-by spam postings from new accounts advertising all sorts of unrelated stuff.) I&#039;m not sure when the no-link policy disappears, but it&#039;s relatively soon after you have joined.</p><p>Please feel free to post your question without a link, or if the link is essential, describe how we might find it (via Google?)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 4 Jan 2017, 22:33)</p>

					<p>@tmomas and @sergio83...</p><p>That&#039;s odd. You were definitely able to post to *this* thread. Can you say what was different between the two posts? If you preview the post, is there anything that the forum software marks as a link?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 5 Jan 2017, 23:20)</p>
