#
# Format is one option per line, legal options are the same
# as the long options legal on the command line. See
# &quot;/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help&quot; or &quot;man 8 dnsmasq&quot; for details.

# The following two options make you a better netizen, since they
# tell dnsmasq to filter out queries which the public DNS cannot
# answer, and which load the servers (especially the root servers)
# uneccessarily. If you have a dial-on-demand link they also stop
# these requests from bringing up the link uneccessarily.

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
bogus-priv


# Uncomment this to filter useless windows-originated DNS requests
# which can trigger dial-on-demand links needlessly.
# Note that (amongst other things) this blocks all SRV requests,
# so don&#039;t use it if you use eg Kerberos.
# This option only affects forwarding, SRV records originating for
# dnsmasq (via srv-host= lines) are not suppressed by it.
filterwin2k

# Change this line if you want dns to get its upstream servers from
# somewhere other that /etc/resolv.conf
#resolv-file=

# By  default,  dnsmasq  will  send queries to any of the upstream
# servers it knows about and tries to favour servers to are  known
# to  be  up.  Uncommenting this forces dnsmasq to try each query
# with  each  server  strictly  in  the  order  they   appear   in
# /etc/resolv.conf
#strict-order

# If you don&#039;t want dnsmasq to read /etc/resolv.conf or any other
# file, getting its servers from this file instead (see below), then
# uncomment this
no-resolv

# If you don&#039;t want dnsmasq to poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv
# files for changes and re-read them then uncomment this.
no-poll

# Add other name servers here, with domain specs if they are for
# non-public domains.
#server=/localnet/192.168.0.1
server=212.23.6.100

# Add local-only domains here, queries in these domains are answered
# from /etc/hosts or DHCP only.
local=/skylark.org.uk/

# Add domains which you want to force to an IP address here.
# The example below send any host in doubleclick.net to a local
# webserver.

# If you want dnsmasq to change uid and gid to something other
# than the default, edit the following lines.
#user=
#group=

# If you want dnsmasq to listen for DHCP and DNS requests only on
# specified interfaces (and the loopback) give the name of the
# interface (eg eth0) here.
# Repeat the line for more than one interface.

# Or which to listen on by address (remember to include 127.0.0.1 if
# you use this.)
#listen-address=
# If you want dnsmasq to provide only DNS service on an interface,
# configure it as shown above, and then use the following line to
# disable DHCP on it.
#no-dhcp-interface=

# On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
# even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards
# requests that it shouldn&#039;t reply to. This has the advantage of
# working even when interfaces come and go and change address. If you
# want dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on,
# uncomment this option. About the only time you may need this is when
# running another nameserver on the same machine.
#bind-interfaces

# If you don&#039;t want dnsmasq to read /etc/hosts, uncomment the
# following line.
#no-hosts
# or if you want it to read another file, as well as /etc/hosts, use
# this.
#addn-hosts=/etc/banner_add_hosts

# Set this (and domain: see below) if you want to have a domain
# automatically added to simple names in a hosts-file.
expand-hosts

# Set the domain for dnsmasq. this is optional, but if it is set, it
# does the following things.
# 1) Allows DHCP hosts to have fully qualified domain names, as long
#     as the domain part matches this setting.
# 2) Sets the &quot;domain&quot; DHCP option thereby potentially setting the
#    domain of all systems configured by DHCP
# 3) Provides the domain part for &quot;expand-hosts&quot;
domain=skylark.org.uk

# Uncomment this to enable the integrated DHCP server, you need
# to supply the range of addresses available for lease and optionally
# a lease time. If you have more than one network, you will need to

					<p>Yeah thats ok. I&#039;ve got years of *nix experience but I&#039;m new to OpenWRT so we can work it out together <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>So, if I&#039;ve got it right, you&#039;re terminating your ISP on OpenWRT, but want stable DHCP leases to your LAN?</p><p>In which case, I&#039;d recommend using NAT (OpenWRT will do this out of the box) to hide your LAN behind the routers external IP Address, and just serve any random IP over your local network. This is the default behaviour, pretty much, so we shouldnt have to do much.</p><p>I don&#039;t think the lo messages will be the cause of your local instability issues. Assuming you haven&#039;t changed the defaults, your wifi + lan will be on &#039;br0&#039;, a single bridge interface. Normally OpenWRT would ignore requests from the WAN side, but if its terminating on lo because of PPP or something, you&#039;ll see them.</p><p>Can you chuck me the output of the following commands?</p><p>nvram get lan_ifname<br />nvram get br0_ipaddr<br />nvram get br0_netmask<br />nvram get dhcp_start<br />nvram get dhcp_num<br />nvram get wan_proto<br />nvram get wan_ifname</p>									</div>

					<p>Thats normal - the default script for dnsmasq tries to avoid having a configuration file so it passes everything in on the command line. I also typod <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> I meant lan_ipaddr and lan_netmask <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Im assuming your lan_ipaddr is something like &#039;10.0.0.1&#039; and your lan_netmask is 255.255.255.0</p><p>In that case we should be seeing your dhcp setting up to serve 150 possible ip addresses with a 12 hour lease , so that should be pretty stable.</p><p>&#039;ps -ef | grep dnsmasq&#039; will tell us if thats the case. </p><p>To suppress your lo errors for the time being kill it, and relaunch it with the &#039;-I lo&#039; argument, which tells it not to listen to that. Lets also take a look at the output of &#039;logread | grep -i dhcp&#039; and your &#039;dnsmasq.leases&#039; file (probably in /tmp)</p><p>Hell, throw a copy of the full ps -ef output for good measure. Im uncertain this is a DHCP issue at all, really, if your LAN clients are falling off the network atm. I suppose a good test might be to configure one of them with a static IP address for a little bit and see if the problem goes away <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I assume your other boot up configs are still pretty stock? Running with the default firewall setup, etc?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, thats pretty much the same config as the default file would have given you. I&#039;m kinda curious as to where its come from though; are you running RC5? Either way, your default is to offer a 12 hour lease on your bridge port so you shouldnt be seeing frequent interuptions unless your ISP is bouncing your link a lot, and as you say it works fine from your router but not your lan that seems unlikely. </p><p>Whats your /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq say?</p><p>Try a static address for now - bed time for me soon but I&#039;ll take another peek tommorow and see how you&#039;re getting on. Don&#039;t forget to throw the contents of your leases file up so we can make sure 12 hour leases are being given and to check the spammy messages from logread are gone. Might be worth leaving this script running too, then checking the output in the morning:</p><p>while true; do<br /> ping -c 1 -q &lt;ISP ip address&gt; || date &gt;&gt;/tmp/ispdown.log<br /> ping -c 1 -q &lt;LAN ip address&gt; || date &gt;&gt;/tmp/landown.log<br /> sleep 1<br />done</p><p>and put this in /etc/hotplug.d/iface/15-logupdown<br />#!/bin/sh<br />echo $ACTION `date` &gt;&gt;/tmp/ifupdown.log</p><br /><p>It&#039;ll run a little loop testing your links to ISP and LAN and see if either of them are being bounced for any reason; a quick &#039;up/down&#039; is unlikely to be caught though, unless its down via ifup/down commands (i.e. not just the ppp link going away on the WAN , etc)</p>									</div>

					<p>that&#039;ll do, yep. its more of a connectivity test, so anything after your local net would work but theres less chance of a false positive the closer it is - fewer things to go wrong that aren&#039;t yours <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
