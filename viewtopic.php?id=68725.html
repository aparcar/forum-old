					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am facing one major issue issue like, when ever I am upgrading the router using router;s luci UI, the configuration file modifications are getting lost.<br />In the UI I am selecting the click button &quot;Keep Setting&quot;, still it does not solve my problem.<br />I debugged and found that the lua is using platform.sh and common.sh 2 scripts for upgrade the firmware and if the keep Setting button is clicked then it should have backup of the configuration file.<br />Internally it is using sysupgrade command to upgrade, manually upgrade also erasing the configuration modifications.<br />Can someone please help me out on it or guide me to solve the issue ???</p><p>Regards,<br />Deepak</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi<br />I found one patch for this issue and still I am facing the same issue for brcm2708 device.<br />Patch: patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/497232/<br />The main issue, it seems like &quot;mount -t vfat -o rw,noatime /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot&quot;.<br />This mount is failing, because of that the config backup file is unable to restored after firmware upgrade.</p><p>Anyone also facing the same issue???</p><p>Regards,<br />Deepak</p>									</div>
