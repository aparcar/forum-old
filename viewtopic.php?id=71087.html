					<p>Hello.</p><p>I&#039;m very newbie at OpenWRT. I&#039;m trying with 14.07 and a Sagem F@ast 2604 only for testing purpose. Now I&#039;m trying to up wifi using uci command. I&#039;m getting success but after a router reboot I have the original configuration for wireless even I&#039;ve submited a uci commit command.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if is a router limitation or if is not the right way to write in the flash memory.</p><p>Regards and thank in advanced</p>									</div>
