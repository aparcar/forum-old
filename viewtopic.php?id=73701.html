					<p>Hi All,<br />I have searched the net, but I am not really sure how to even ask this question(!)&nbsp; I am NOT a network engineer!</p><p>I currently have a mish-mash of three WiFi routers in my house that comprise the &quot;mesh&quot; and one main (actual) router (that provides a WiFi connection as well).&nbsp; All &quot;mesh&quot; routers are hard-wired (through their non-WAN ports) to a switch and ultimately an openwrt router that handles the DHCP, DNS, etc.&nbsp; They all share the same access point name and credentials so you can walk around and seamlessly connect to the different wifi connections.&nbsp; All wired connections and hardware are Gig-E.</p><p>Here is my hardware:<br />main router: <br />Linksys E4200v2/EA4500 (openwrt kernel version 4.4.14)</p><p>Three &quot;mesh&quot; routers running their stock firmware:<br />2x Netgear G54 WGR614v10<br />1x TP-Link 450N Wireless N</p><p>My problems are:<br />1) The routers are slow and need to be upgraded (I hope to get used ones from ebay)<br />2) I would like to have a guest network to partition my IoT devices from my more sensitive data and servers as well as provide a network for people visiting.</p><p>My questions are:<br />1) What routers would you recommend.<br />2) Can you point me in the right direction to implement the configuration?</p><p>thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jordanthompson</strong> on 2 Apr 2018, 03:44)</p>

					<p>That sort of setup would be better described as a network of APs.&nbsp; &quot;Mesh&quot; describes a way to distribute the LAN using wireless instead of wired connections between the AP devices.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meshing is the latest big thing in commercial home equipment since it allows a very simple zero setup &quot;plug and play&quot; installation.&nbsp; But wired connections are still best other than having to install cables.</p><p>In general you set up the APs as &quot;dumb&quot; wireless to wired converters and have the main router do all routing and firewalling.&nbsp; This can include having two networks and firewalls in parallel, one for trusted users and one for IOTs and guests.</p><p>Distributing multiple networks is easy with wired connections since you can use the Ethernet VLAN standard.&nbsp; Both ends of the link must be VLAN-capable, which almost any device running OpenWrt is.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 8 Apr 2018, 15:52)</p>

					<p>That&#039;s pretty much the way I have it configured today without multiple VLAN&#039;s (I guess I need to do some learning on this.) </p><p>I think that I&#039;ll need each router to support multiple SSID&#039;s to support guest log in on the IoT network. </p><p>Any recommendations for decent (fast) WiFi routers I can get used that will run openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jordanthompson</strong> on 9 Apr 2018, 01:31)</p>

					<p>I still have not figured out how to configure the additional routers to support multiple access points. Can anyone please point me in the right direction?</p>									</div>
