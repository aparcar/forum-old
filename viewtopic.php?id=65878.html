					<p>Hi, i&#039;m aware of guest wifi recipe, but&nbsp; I&#039;d like to make guest lan on dumb ap. My router is wr841n and for now acting like a dumb switch with wifi (firewall disabled, dhcp server disabled, wlan, eth0 (4 port switch) and eth1 (wan) bridged together.</p><p>Now I&#039;d like to add a wireless guest ap with own range (where guest won&#039;t see/access my lan devices), but I need all lan ports bridged with my home wifi and create a seperate guest wifi with own IP range, NAT and dhcp server. I have made a few attempts, which made router inaccessible and led to firstboot :-(</p><p>Thank you for help.</p>									</div>
