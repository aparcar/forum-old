If I wanted greater than 150Mbps I would be paying more to Comcast then my router cost each month. Faster download speeds are not really worth what Comcast charges. I would never use century link and in most areas without fiber, it is the exact same situation with another cable internet provider.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Anon28435</strong> on 13 Jul 2014, 00:05)</p>
