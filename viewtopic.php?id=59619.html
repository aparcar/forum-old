					<p>@amit.shah By default, your router is access point and your mobile phone is a client. If my understanding is correct, you are scanning other devices. Does that mean you want to connect to other access points or client(station)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Initial router configured as an LAN AP. So Any wireless device can connect to it, Then we scan the device and the scan result with all SSID list appears on screen and then Connect to SSID and join the network, joining to other SSID We create separate client(station) and connect to it. </p><p>Basically we need to configure the Wireless module as LAN SSID and client(station WDS). So our module will connect to other AP/hotspot and at the same time Any smartphone/laptop can connect to our module.</p>									</div>

					<p>Perhaps it&#039;s an issue of your client device not re-connecting automatically back to the AP after the AP WiFi network comes back online.</p><p>Try on a device that has no other WiFi networks &quot;known&quot; by it (&quot;forget&quot; all of them except your AP), and see if the client will re-connect when the AP comes back online.&nbsp; Not sure it will re-connect fast enough to allow the UI to load the next page, but the device should re-connect and at least provide access to the WWAN side of the connection.</p><p>I don&#039;t think there is anyway to avoid a disconnect from the AP to the client when you perform the Join Network.&nbsp; That being the case, the issue lies with the client not re-connecting automatically and/or quickly enough.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think it is possible to re-configure a single physical radio and not cause a drop in the WiFi connection.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe this is a fault of OpenWRT, it is simply a limitation of using a single radio to perform two tasks (AP and Client).&nbsp; &nbsp; You would be better off using a 2 radio device and then this problem is not a problem.&nbsp; Probably not an easy solution, but likely the only one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks JohnV, for your support and replies. </p><p>however, our think tank leaders still don&#039;t accepts this disconnection issue, according to them it must be handled using some coding to stop the disconnection before the web query completes. at least it should send some response to the webpage back before the AP disconnects. so please let me know how can i find that bunch of code and put some log to know where exactly it happens, and what all we can do. </p><p>i remembered told something about &quot;nixio.syslog&quot;, let me find tutorial how to use it.</p>									</div>
