					<p>I come across a strange issue when trying to cross compile a application for openwrt system after cross-compiled all the required libraries for my application (openssl, mdns, event2, curl, libweave, chromium, crypto, expat, gtest gmock), I got follow error during final linking. <br />I was able to compile my application with many other libraries and this issue only happens when I enable these new set of features and libraries into the the application.</p><p>Here is the error log:<br />{path1}/mipsel-openwrt-linux-uclibc/bin/ld: appName: hidden symbol `atexit&#039; in {path1}/lib/uclibc_nonshared.a(atexit.os) is referenced by DSO<br />{path1}/mipsel-openwrt-linux-uclibc/bin/ld: final link failed: Bad value<br />collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status<br />make[2]: * [appName] Error 1<br />make[1]: * [CMakeFiles/appName.dir/all] Error 2<br />make: * [all] Error 2</p><p>platform: RT288x/ RT5350/ VoCore, release version r46174</p><p>other information:<br />I am using Cmake to compile my project. A modified version of openwrt toolchain is built and used to gain access to the beta version of libevent.<br />According to Google results, this usually happens when x DSO is trying to access y DSO hidden symbol. On the other hand, &#039;atexit&#039; doesn&#039;t always is hidden depending on the system. <br />I also try to built with V=s -j1 enabled, no additional information is printed.. </p><p>also running: `objdump -t uclibc_nonshared.a | grep atexit` does indicate atexit is a global hidden symbol. <br />00000000 g&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;F .text.atexit&nbsp; &nbsp; 00000030 .hidden atexit</p><p>Could someone let me know am I looking into the right direction?</p>									</div>

					<p>I would be quite interesting to have libweave on openwrt. <br />I tried to compile on 14.07 with ucLibc but I didn&#039;t get as far as you, a lot of missing headers and c++14 features (atomic header etc) from the chromium dependency.</p>									</div>
