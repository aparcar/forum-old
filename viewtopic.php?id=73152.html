					<p>Hello OpenWRT community...</p><p>Background: I&#039;ve previously ran and successfully install Tomato (Shibby) and DD-WRT.&nbsp; Seeing the two projects will unlikely be maintained in the future and the rejuvenation of OpenWRT/LEDE I&#039;d figure I should switch to OpenWRT.</p><p>I followed wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160n</p><p>Installed downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm47xx/mips74k/openwrt-brcm47xx-mips74k-linksys-wrt160n-v3-squashfs.bin</p><p>Checked if this is a recent build and going to the directory seems to suggest it was built Dec 2017).</p><p>I flashed the router which seemed to work without a hitch.</p><p>Issues:<br />Out of box I was not able to access the web interface.<br />* No front facing builds should have this disabled.</p><p>I read upon the Wiki, (also made some updates), and I was able to get in via SSH, (no password).<br />Set the root password and attempted to set for network access.<br />* I am not new with configuring linux but this is way over the head of most people.</p><p>Questions:<br />Was there a step that I missed or did I grab the wrong build?</p><p>How would I recover from this state to go to a more feature enabled build?</p><p>Why is this so complicated, (builds should be straight forward with installation and configuring... having to drop into command line will loss most users, this state should only be needed for advanced users or administrators)?</p><br /><p>I want the project to succeed, especially since other firmware projects are stagnating.&nbsp; I definitely think the instructions / wiki could be improved.&nbsp; Any help or direction from the community would be appreciated.</p><p>PS: Can&#039;t post links in this forum?!?!?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t understand why doing additional installation for the web UI has to be done.</p><p>First off I did not notice any information that this was an admin type of install. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if people run into this and think their router is bricked, (more warnings and clear steps need to be provided).</p><p>Secondly, flashing the image should not require CLI to get things started.&nbsp; Develop builds need to be clearly labeled as such if this is the case.</p><p>So is no GUI standard for all images or did I get a DEV build?&nbsp; How would I tell the difference?</p>									</div>

					<p>The &quot;v&quot; numbers in the built filenames indicate different hardware versions, not software upgrades.&nbsp; You should not try to flash a build for a different hardware version than your router unless you know exactly what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; It is very common in the industry for a manufacturer to build a router with the same model number and external appearance as one they previously sold, but having <em>completely different</em> hardware inside.&nbsp; Usually, but not always, this change is indicated by them adding a &quot;v2&quot; etc to the model number on the nameplate and usually, but not always, the retail box.</p><p>At this time, the 17.01.4 build is the latest stable release.&nbsp; There is one for the WRT160v3 and will include the web interface.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 4 Feb 2018, 17:18)</p>
