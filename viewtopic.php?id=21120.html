I had seen Omnima and that is where I found out about these routers. I went through the sales process after selecting the unit, wall wart and case, plus shipping it turned out to be $70! Ouch! I founds some Edimax and Sweex routers on eBay in the UK. I won a Sweex for 0.99 GBP. I tossed another 5 GBP since the seller was willing to ship to the US. 15 GBP with shipping in all which is like $27 total.</p><p>Greg</p>									</div>
