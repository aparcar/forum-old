					<p>I&#039;ve built OpenWrt 15.05 with the wireless kernel module CFG80211 selected. When it boots up, it outputs a message &quot;cfg80211: Calling CRDA to update world regulatory domain&quot;, but no further messages about updating the regulatory domain. The crda package was not installed in the system, which might well explain the lack of regulatory update. </p><p>I can&#039;t find OpenWrt &#039;make menuconfig&#039; options to include crda. Also, the crda documentation indicates that udev needs to be installed in order to use crda, but udev is not selected by default (and I don&#039;t want to install it if I don&#039;t have to, as I&#039;m trying to keep the system size to a minimum). Installing the crda package manually doesn&#039;t fix the problem.</p><p>What is the recommended way to ensure wireless regulatory compliance in an OpenWrt system? If it&#039;s by use of crda, what are the necessary configuration options, and other steps which need to be taken, to activate this?</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt use compat-wireless aka. package/kernel/mac80211. If you want to use the in-tree mac80211 enable internal regdb support as well and patch the regdb into the kernel. You can also package crda if that&#039;s what you prefer.</p>									</div>

					<p>Compat-wireless is just a backport of the same. Just saying in-tree stack is unsupported by OpenWrt. package/kernel/mac80211 also uses the internal regdb approach but is already patched, so you no longer have to. There is no dependency on udev for crda, just that this is the default tool to act upon the regulatory event. You can just as well use procd in it&#039;s stead. Mdev can&#039;t be used.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can anybody help on how to configure procd to activate crda when the kernel requests it. I presume that procd&#039;s config must need to be set up so that the regulatory function will be handled. Also, does regulatory.rules need to be installed somewhere?</p>									</div>
