					<p>I&#039;ve got a LAN with a wireless bridge across it (both the router and the bridge are WRT54Gs running openwrt, and the layout is like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>                                               [wireless host]
                                                    |
[wired host2] -- [ Bridge WRT ]---wireless-- [Router WRT] ---- [Internet]
                                                    |
                                               [wired host1]</code></pre></div><p>The bridge is running in WET mode, per the Bridged Client Mode howto. IPv4 networking is working just fine; all hosts are able to ping each other, and broadcast packets work too (All hosts show up in a Samba/Windows filesharing list). There are duplicate ping responses between wired host2 and wireless host, but this seems not to be a very big problem.</p><p>I&#039;ve got an IPv6 tunnel from Hurrican electric set up, with radvd running on the router WRT. Wireless host, Wired host 1, Router WRT and Bridge WRT are all able to use IPv6 properly. (well, properly as in they&#039;re able to ping6 <a href="http://www.kame.net">www.kame.net</a>)</p><p>However, wired host2, behind the wireless bridge is unable to ping6 any host except for bridge WRT, and neither wireless host, wired host1 or router WRT are able to ping6 wired host2. Ping6 packets that try to cross the bridge are silently lost&nbsp; (i.e. no destination host unreachable errors or similar)</p><p>I have tried radvd in both unicast and multicast mode (I read in another forum post that there may have been issues with multicast and bridged client mode), and both have the same trouble.</p><p>However, wired host2 does seem to be able to resolve ipv6 host names (i.e. it resolves <a href="http://www.kame.net">www.kame.net</a> to 2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085). It also has automatically acquired a scope:global IPv6 address and LAN /default routes, for whatever it&#039;s worth.</p><p>Is there something I&#039;m missing here, or is this a protocol limitation that I&#039;m stuck with?</p>									</div>

					<p>Same title applies to my problem, but it&#039;s a little different.</p><p>I have a WRT running RC5 in client bridge mode (via the http interface) and have just set up a SixXS tunnel to it.&nbsp; I&#039;m able to ping6 <a href="http://www.kame.net">www.kame.net</a> from the router but not from my WinXP host.&nbsp; Radvd appears to be working as my host did obtain an IP and I can ping6 the WRT, however I&#039;m unable to ping6 anything beyond it (request timed out).</p><p>I followed the wiki instructions with one exception, using &quot;ipv4_interface br0&quot; in aiccu.conf due to being in client bridge mode.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m able to ping6 out from the router, I think this is the only change needed??&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried with ip6tables disabled to troubleshoot (with no change).</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so at least one thing I&#039;ve been told is missing from the wiki:<br />echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding</p><p>I&#039;ve added this to my startup scripts and I&#039;m still getting &quot;request timeouts&quot; when trying to ping6 <a href="http://www.kame.net">www.kame.net</a> from the client PC.&nbsp; I&#039;m able to resolve IPv6 addresses, just doesn&#039;t look like forwarding is working.&nbsp; I&#039;ve rechecked my WinXP settings and it doesn&#039;t look like the problem is with the client.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KillaB</strong> on 24 Apr 2006, 02:30)</p>
