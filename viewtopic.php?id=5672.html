On the internet I found only brochures about the AR7 and no application notes that can be usefull. </p><p>I saw two AVM routers that differ for the annex A o B standard. They seem to have differences in the dicretes and in the line coupling. Could someone confirm this?</p><p>I found few old post with similar questions but without replys.</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p><p>Livio</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure if you are asking about functional or technical differences. Also, this question really does not belong here, but nevermind. I only know the functional differences:</p><p>Annex A is for ADSL over POTS (plain old telephone system)<br />Annex B is for ADSL over ISDN </p><p>Because the cutoff frequency for the filter is different, they need different filter coils (or so I suspect), so it is not a simple matter of different firmware, but different hardware. You need either one or the other, based on whether you have a ISDN phone or not. I&#039;ve only ever seen one device that supported both.</p>									</div>

					<p>Really? So all these companies keep double stock, double packaging etc, when it could be a simple firmware setting?&nbsp; Being blessed with no actual knowledge, I choose to think it is *also* a firmware setting. </p><p>Not that it matters really.</p>									</div>

					<p>can confirm from practice that modems exist that can do either, selectable through the modem setup menu.<br />As the frequency spectrum is different for the two (the ISDN compatible annex B must leave the lower 100 kHz available to ISDN) the filtering is different. When all filtering is done digitally, it&#039;s a microcode issue. When some filtering is done using discrete LC networks there will exist different modem hardware versions, as often the case in older adsl modems.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for yours reply also to an off-topics question.</p><p>It&#039;s true that the firmware is different, but not only the firmware. With the AVM routers, you can load the firmware for the other standard/annex and it could work if the line attenuation is low and the signal to noise rate is high.</p><p>AVM sells two models: annex A and B. I have both of them. The pcb is the same, but it is differently populated in the line coupling section. Much more complex for the Annex A, may be a higher order filter.</p><p>I don&#039;t know the AR7 family. May be it is possible to support both standards with the same hardware, but I think that there are a way to switch the external filters/discretes according to the frequency band you want to be filtered.</p><p>Is there anyone who has the application notes or the schematics of the Texas Instruments reference board?</p><p>Thank you very much for your support.</p><p>Livio</p>									</div>
