					<p>TW-533-4 Requires loading of firmware through this unique port yet no one, not even the Vendor seems to know which pins are what with the exception of one of OpenWrt&#039;s contributors which provided mapping for 3 of the 10 ports.&nbsp; I need to load openwrt to 6 of these units but I cannot determine the DTR/DSR/CTS and RTS pins on said connector.&nbsp; This is imperative since this is a fixed 115200 speed RS-232 header socket.&nbsp; It would help significantly if someone could contribute the information for the ports mentioned above.&nbsp; I am aware several of the subscribers use these boards or so it seems from posted information on this site.&nbsp; I am aware of the RD(pin 4), TD(pin 6) and GND (pin 8).&nbsp; I presume since pin 10 is a stable +5v it may be the DTR pin.&nbsp; Thanks for any help.&nbsp; I would like to expand some code for OpenWrt to also facilitate wild card NetBios Name Filtering once I can load and test OpenWrt on these boards.&nbsp; I have a couple applications involving HLS which require this type of filtering.&nbsp; Yes, I have 46+ years experience in communications hardware and software so technical terms will not overwhelm me (generally).</p>									</div>
