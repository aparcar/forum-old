					<p>@ qus:</p><p>Sounds similar to my problem when I try running executables off my SD card on my WRT54GL. Could you please verify that it shows the same characteristics? Just check the following points:</p><p>1. Copy a lot of files to your external media (make sure it is far more than the RAM you have, so it doesn&#039;t all stay in the buffer cache). Then diff the copied stuff with the source and/or generate md5sums on both and compare them (Make sure you use comparison utilities that are not stored on external media). Is the data still the same? For me there were no data integrity problems. How about you?</p><p>2. Choose a few programs common programs that you have stored on your router&#039;s internal flash and make a couple of test runs (busybox, gnu diff, tcpdump, whatever). Make sure that every executable code they need (like themselves and the libraries) is fetched from the router&#039;s internal filesystem. Do they run okay without strange crashes? For me this worked flawlessly.</p><p>3. Now run the same executables from your external media. For me this induced spontaneous mandelbugs a la segmentation fault, bus error, and other such nasty things. Often this was not reproducable by running the executable a second time immediately after the first run. What happens on your device?</p><br /><p>Regards,<br />Niels Böhm</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s been quite a while since these posts. Apparently 2.6 is still not fit or is there another problem? Exact same issue here:<br />When loading from SD:<br />- Segmentation Fault/Bur Error/Illegal Instruction<br />After a few tries the program usually loads. Problem occurs more often the bigger the program being loaded is.</p>									</div>

					<p>Filesystems are ext4, error free, and like reported in previous posts in this thread, I can cp and mv files around like crazy and not have them get corrupted (checked with md5sums).<br />I do find read and write speeds of the SD card very low (~40KB/s)... but seems to be quite stable at that.<br />wrt54gl v1.1 with SD card mod.</p>									</div>
