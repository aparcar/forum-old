					<p>Whatever I do I can not forward port 80 from wan to my server behind wl-500gp with openwrt.&nbsp; I have tried those examples in /etc/firewall.conf. Ive tried to add ip and hostname to hosts.conf and mac with ip-add to ethers. Why arent there any howto&#039;s on this subject. I&#039;ve seen a lot of posts when googling aroun about people who dont now howto do this. All answers where add: iptables -P portforwaring... as described in firewall.conf but it just dosnt work.</p><p>vpn is not an alternative. Am i missing something. </p><p>Please someone do a howto and tell me if there are any dependencies that i need to install.</p><p>Im been trying to get my server on the wan side for about 4 weeks now without any success. Lan side is no problem.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orso</strong> on 21 Oct 2007, 00:49)</p>
