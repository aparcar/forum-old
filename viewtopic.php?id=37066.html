					<p>Hello,</p><p>A few months ago, I hurt my WRT board a little while opening it, partially ripping off a capacitor and a 5 leads component. Then stupidly tried to fix it with a cheap 25W soldering iron and its burned tip. Oh, and a little glue to keep them in place firmly... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /><br />That was my first time at SMD rework and it didn&#039;t left me with a good impression.</p><p>As you can (or cannot) see on the (blurry) photo below, the result was not as expected. Since then, no radio interface showed up and I was left with an expensive wired router.</p><p>Now that I own a hot air rework station and all, I&#039;d like to train my skills.<br />It seems to me that the battlefield I wasted is the alimentation of the radio part of the router, located just under the Faraday shield.</p><p>Could someone which has already tinkered his/her way in a similar version of the board put a name on the U8 chip, please? The part is burned and inscription are unreadable here.<br />Last but not least, capacitors C82 and mostly C106 may have been damaged, do you know roughly their values?</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sE1pO.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/sE1pO.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, if you post clearer images I can try to see what are those components..btw the capacitor seems a 1uF-10uF 16V ceramic, not trivial. The other can be a LDO (Low Drop-Out voltage regulator)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your help dabyd64!<br />I&#039;ll try to put a better photo online. Since capacitors don&#039;t have any markings and the one from LDO have been erased with my soldering iron, I thought this wasn&#039;t useful.</p><p>Since then I&#039;ve been able to identify the 5-lead chip, a LDO as you assumed.<br />A friend of mine has a v2.0 board with a pretty similar design to my v2.2: same components at the same location. The marking on the 5-lead being &#039;LAYA&#039;.<br />I found its reference (LP2985AIM5-1.8) on an older version of the datasheet (p.3): <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/snos510o/snos510o.pdf">http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/snos510o/snos510o.pdf</a><br />It&#039;s the SOT-23 package, 1.8V A-grade version of the component.<br />They come really cheap at Farnell (a few cents in France): <a href="http://fr.farnell.com/national-semiconductor/lp2985aim5-1-8-nopb/regulateur-lineaire-1-8v-cms/dp/1469131">http://fr.farnell.com/national-semicond … dp/1469131</a></p><p>If needed, I will scavenge the C106 cap on a useless v6.0 board which has a quite similar radio alimentation circuit (different LDO though).</p><p>I&#039;ll keep you updated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nice ! Sometimes is really hard to find the component with the smd marking code. You had luck! If they&#039;re chinese copies then it is almost imposible.<br />For the smd capacitors, solder some capacitors as big as possible, that could fit in that size, but cheap.<br />I recommend you some 0805 size, 10uF capacitor, since a bigger value is better for the voltage stability, specially in RF devices.<br />Most of the smd ceramic capacitors used in boards are 100nF (0.1 uF) for decoupling. Only a few are more than 1uF.<br />Usually, the color will give you a hint. The more brown it is, the more capacity it will have, but not always. Source: My electronics experience.</p><p>Just in the case you wanna buy them I found those in ebay for less than $3 (50pcs):<br /><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/50-PCS-0805-10uF-10V-X7R-SMD-Ceramic-Capacitor-106-/220983887703?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3373aa8757">http://www.ebay.com/itm/50-PCS-0805-10u … 3373aa8757</a></p><p>Let&#039;s hope you will fix that!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you for some reason still need pictures of the WRT54G v2.2 board - let me know as I have one here somewhere.<br />(virgin board, everything untouched so far)<br />Wife has a good Nikon so it should be doable.</p><p>/Huldu</p>									</div>
