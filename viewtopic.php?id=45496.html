					<p>Hello!<br />There are two routers. 1043ND and a 941ND, connected by WDS. The head-1043ND connects to it 941ND (DHCP disabled) customers only LAN. The problem is that between these routers is lost connection via Wi-Fi every 10 minutes, 20 seconds. If you connect the device to the 941ND or 1043ND on Wi-Fi, then this is not observed. <br />In what may be the Problem?<br />Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>-KAPMA-</strong> on 30 Jul 2013, 13:30)</p>
