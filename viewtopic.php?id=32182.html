					<p>Hi</p><p>I wanted to create one of these (<a href="http://www.tinkernut.com/archives/2387">http://www.tinkernut.com/archives/2387</a>) but i the asus wasnt easily avalible so i got a d-link dir-320 (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-320">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-320</a>).</p><p>I flashed open wrt fine but couldn&#039;t get my wifi to connect. I found this page when looking for a solution (<a href="http://dir-320.weebly.com/openwrt-firmware.html">http://dir-320.weebly.com/openwrt-firmware.html</a>). It says the one firmware version &quot;does not detect the Wireless Interface&quot; so i decided to try another. I tried to upload a new firmware through the openwrt GUI but now i cannot connect to my router. I have tried pinging every IP i have ever given it but no luck. </p><p>When i power on the router the power light and all network port lights come on initially and then only the power light comes on. after some time the read light goes solid green. This makes me think it may not be bricked?<br />What are my options?</p><p>It has a serial connection. Could i TTL into the router and flash new firmware that way?<br />Any help would be great.<br />Thank you,</p>									</div>
