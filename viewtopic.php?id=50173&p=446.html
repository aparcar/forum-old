					<p>There are many great git tutorials out there which do a better job explaining then I could. Basically you commit your changes to the local repo with add and commit.

					<p>@JW0914</p><p>Going over the wiki page while writing this post, holding down some thoughts. Maybe you can use them to improve the page.</p><p>Intro notes<br />-----------</p><p>15.05, not 15.05.1, red letters - quite bad, new users get sent to download old release?<br />The second bullet point is at best a historical anecdote, the versions better move to firmware images -&gt; trunk<br />Are the chances really that big that one would need an usb2ttl cable?</p><p>I&#039;d remove all of them, they only serve to confuse or scare a user.</p><p>firmware images<br />---------------<br />Should be split in official and community.<br />Official be split in release and trunk.<br />Current offical, again plenty links to old firmware. Replace with instructions on how to find the latest release and determine image based on device codename.<br />Please verify checksum goes before any images.<br />Broken opkg.conf belongs into a troubleshooting section. Is there still such an image listed?<br />Kaloz builds, weren&#039;t they just staging builds and no longer relevant?<br />Revert to default settings -&gt; troubleshooting section, also, isn&#039;t firstboot the canonical method? luci?</p><p>Supported hardware<br />------------------<br />Supported Current Rel, broken by design. Obviously any later release will have support. Should the day really come this is no longer the case a last supported release column can be added.<br />Codename should be first level column, as it&#039;s required to determine the correct image.<br />wrt1200ac switch power supply and &quot;switch&quot; column.</p><p>Corrupt Bootloader Recovery<br />---------------------------<br />Is most probably destructive for all but the original 1900ac. Not that it would matter much if you already truly bricked the bootloader.</p>									</div>
