					<p>Sorry for newbie questions: </p><p>I plan to purchase Linksys WRT1200, but I believe that it natively does not support setting up the router as an OpenVPN Client (only as an OpenVPN server).</p><p>If I instead use OpenVPN firmware, will the router support OpenVPN as a Client?<br />If so, what version of the firmware should I download (link please)?</p><p>Also, I am a novice, so I definitely need a GUI; which is the easiest to use GUI; LuCI or Gargoyle? I believe Gargoyle?<br />However, it doesn&#039;t appear that Gargoyle supports the WRT1200?</p><p> I need something that is easy to setup and gets me up and running quickly (w/o too much time learning how to install software and commands).</p><p>TIA!</p>									</div>

					<p>Have you looked at the wiki entry for openvpn within the openwrt wiki? You should be able to do it, but I&#039;m not personally familiar with the steps.</p>									</div>
