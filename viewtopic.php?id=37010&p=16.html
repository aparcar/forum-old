					<p>While trying to revert my TL-WR841N v8.2 to stock (from bassman barrier breaker) I have got the &quot;missing web interface&quot; problem mentioned on the main WR841 page.<br />Using a serial connection to minicom on a raspberry pi at 115,200/8N1 I have console access but I never see the &quot;Autobooting in 1 seconds&quot; message, what happens on boot is a few lines of garbled characters and then I see perfect text with no garbage (at the end of it I can log in as root with the password 5up and interact), it is just the first few seconds which are garbled, presumably where I need to type &#039;TPL&#039;. I thought maybe the Uboot needs different com settings but I have tried 9600 and 38400 but with these settings I can&#039;t see anything.<br />Anybody have any idea why I can&#039;t see the Uboot output if this indeed what the problem is?<br />Or alternatively can I do anything with the root access as I can log in fine.<br />Should I post my console output?<br />Should I start another thread?<br />All advice welcome <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Chris<br />EDITED to say that the interfaces are configured and working and I can ping a out from inside the router&#039;s console - I just don&#039;t know how or even if it&#039;s possible to flash a new image from this point - tftpboot is mentioned in most howtos but these are based on the uboot console. tftp on its own seems to do something so maybe I can get a new file copied over but then how to write it?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eXc3ption</strong> on 18 Jan 2014, 14:22)</p>

					<p>Ok I installed the new firmware and it seems to work so far. Although WiFi seems much slower on mobile apps, though. YouTube, Snapchat, and Facebook apps take very long to load, among others. It&#039;s weird, only the actual apps are an issue. Pretty noticeable. Although the speed test app on my phone says otherwise. So clearly only certain apps are affected, not sure why.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t have these issues on r36088. Anything I can do to fix it?</p><br /><p>Also, How do I install those patches? Or are they already built into the firmware?</p><br /><br /><p>If nobody has a solution to the slow mobile apps on WiFi, can I directly revert back to the old firmware using LuCI? I don&#039;t want to because now Chromecast is working on ethernet computers but I can&#039;t get past the extremely slow apps while connected to WiFi.</p><br /><p>All help is greatly appreciated!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>alecpozner</strong> on 22 Jan 2014, 06:57)</p>
