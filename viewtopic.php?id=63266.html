					<p>So I have been around wiki and forums to make my own firmware for MR3420 V2. I have some information on how to do it and that&#039;s quite enough for starters but I have one question.</p><p>If I make my own image do I get one image file that is compatible with both MR3420 V1 &amp; V2<br />or<br />Do I need to tell the image builder that I need V2 instead of V1?</p><p>P.S. I&nbsp; have seen the profile names for AR71xx and they don&#039;t include any version numbers so that&#039;s why I am curious as to how should I go for it before bricking my router obviously.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
