					<p>Hello all,</p><p>Can anyone share some tips on how to solder ground pins on the router. I mean those serial port pins which are marked with dotted circle on the PCB. The problem is that soldering metal just don&#039;t want to stick to it. There is no problem with other pins and soldering them are very fast and smooth, but not the ground pin. I&#039;ve searched the internet and found that this is common problem, but still didn&#039;t find good tips on how to solder them. So maybe some of you can share the ideas of soldering ground pins.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had similar problems using my 8W iron. Seems like the big ground plane dissipates the heat too fast. Using a 20W iron took about 2-3 s to heat it up sufficiently for soldering a wire.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was working with 25W iron, but it was really not enough. Only problem was very thin tip of the iron. Maybe that is the problem. Now I&#039;m considering to buy 60W soldering station. It would be easier to vary temperatures I think.<br />About tinning the pad first. Yes, I&#039;ve done that, but still had lots of problems soldering. I still believe that heat dissipation and thin tip of iron is the cause.</p>									</div>
