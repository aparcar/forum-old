					<p>Hi, <br />I&#039;m not sure about my WRT54G configuration. My ideia is interconnect a microcontroller with the WRT54G using RS232 (This already is functioning.) and after this, send and receive information from a Wireless PC.<br />Then I configured my connection between the PC and router with an ad hoc connection. My NVRAM:</p><p>wl0_net_mode=mixed<br />wl0_infra=0<br />wl0_ifname=eth1<br />wl0_mode=ap<br />wl0_gmode=1<br />wl0_ssid=GSIM<br />wl0_closed=0<br />wl0_macmode=disabled<br />wl0_channel=6</p><p>I have used mode acess point, because When my device will be on, my PC, PDA, and so on, can be able to connect it.<br />I want to do something like a wireless station to monitoring something. What is the usual config?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Wesley</p>									</div>
