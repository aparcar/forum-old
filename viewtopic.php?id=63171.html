					<p>I have a SIP-adapter which supports only one SIP account.</p><p>For tarification reasons I want to be able to route my outbound calls between several different SIP-operators.<br />The inbound call would come from only one of those SIP-operators.<br />(I intend to have active accounts with all SIP-operators involved in my routing. SIP-adapter would be registered only once - to be able to receive calls from only one operator)</p><p>I have already asked the <strong>siproxd</strong>&#039;s author if siproxd can be of any help in this scenario. Unfortunately the reply was negative - the siproxd was not designed for such tasks, no plug-ins exist to help in my case.</p><p>What could you suggest me to look at (apart from asterisk)?<br />I need to have it running on my OpenWrt-powered Asus WL-330N3G.</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booBot</strong> on 5 Mar 2016, 22:30)</p>

					<p>Not quite an answer you were looking for, but an alternative -- do you have to host it on your own hardware? pbxes.org used to provide free service for cases like yours.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d like to avoid third party dependencies as much as possible. Besides, since such a proxy will never be used to place a chargeable call (neither to PSTN nor to GSM), I really doubt someone could provide such a service for free.</p><p>As far as I understand, it is possible to get extra disk space via extroot (my USB-modem, Huawei E3131, has a memory card slot), so a minimalistic installation of the asterisk could go there.<br />But I&#039;m looking for something less complicated.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>booBot</strong> on 6 Mar 2016, 21:41)</p>
