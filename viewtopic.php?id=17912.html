					<p>Hi!</p><p>I have just bought WL-500G Premium router (V1) and Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 and Logitech QuickCam Sphere AF webcams.</p><p>I followed koMar&#039;s instructions (<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14754">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=14754</a>) and I it&#039;s working perfect with both cameras (focus, pan/tilt). The only thing it doesn&#039;t work is that code I insert into /etc/init.d/done is not exectued, so I have to manually enter mount and mjpg_streamer command everytime I reboot the router. If I try to enter following command, I get response:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# /etc/init.d/done
/bin/sh: can&#039;t open /etc/rc.common</code></pre></div><p>I also replaced stock wireless card with the one koMar suggested (Tp-Link TL-WN560G Mini PCI card) in wireless works, but I want that it is connected to my existing wireless network in my house (as client). I double checked configuration and it&#039;s not working as it should. I configured static IP for LAN (192.168.1.50) and WLAN part (192.168.1.51) and when LAN cable is connected I am able to connect with SSH to both IPs. But if I unplug LAN cable, it&#039;s not possible to connect to WLAN IP anymore (192.168.1.51) - somekind they are connected, but I am not sure how.</p><p>I am not so experienced in linux so I will be appreciate for any help!</p>									</div>
