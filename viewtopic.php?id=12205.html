					<p>Hello!</p><p>Excuse my question - but don&#039;t know where to start here.</p><p>I want to build a wireless hotspot in a hotel. Customers should pay for accessing the hotspot in advance (hotspot-ticket for an hour or so) or should be billed afterwards based on usage data. If it is possible, both variants should be possible.</p><p>As the Chillspot site is down i have less information on how to build such a scenario. </p><p>Could anyone give me a hint where to start and how this scenario works?<br />Do I need external hardware (for freeradius eg)?</p><p>I think this could be used by many OpenWRT users - maybe I could build a howto in the wiki with your help.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Florian Lagg</p>									</div>

In any case it should be a desicion of the hotel owner. The first customer using the solution wants to bill his customers for providing this service - but maybe only the price for an hotel reservation gets a euro higher ;-)<br />Btw: if you do not pay for internet access explicitly be sure that you pay it anyway hidden in your hotel bill. Believe me.<br />How to pay for internet is not fully defined now. We are in a very early projecting stage. A flat rate is in discussion.</p><p>Thanks anyway.<br />May I ask you how much do you pay for hotspot access <br />* in a hotel (the not-free once)<br />* in a cafe/bar<br />* ...</p><p>Would be very interesting to know how much is billed overseas.</p><p>Another question:<br />Are you willing to pay if the service e.g. is secured with VPN?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Florian Lagg</p>									</div>

It is a convenience which the hotel assumes many guests will use, perhaps most guests, and it persuades guests to pick one hotel over another.</p><p>It is very common in the US for <em>low-price</em> hotels to offer free Internet, while <em>high-price</em> hotels charge a fee for it. To me, that&#039;s the reverse of what I would expect - perhaps the expensive hotels assume that their guests are there on business, and will gladly have their employer pay the fee? I honestly do not understand.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>laggflor wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>May I ask you how much do you pay for hotspot access <br />* in a hotel (the not-free once)<br />* in a cafe/bar<br />* ...</p></blockquote></div><p>In a hotel, anywhere from $8 to $20 for a 24-hour period.<br />In a cafe or bar... I don&#039;t know, but I would guess $4 or $5 for an hour or two.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>laggflor wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Are you willing to pay if the service e.g. is secured with VPN?</p></blockquote></div><p>No, because I&#039;m already using SSH or some other secure form of networking! But it&#039;s an interesting concept, definitely an added value to the service offered.</p><p>Meanwhile, this isn&#039;t solving your technical problems... I hope that&#039;s going well for you!</p>									</div>
