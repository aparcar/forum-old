					<p>I wrote a USB over IP system for several platforms including openwrt.&nbsp; Sorry its not open source but it is free to share one device. Its mainly useful for OEMs who want to provide usb sharing functionality from their routers.</p><p>The server runs entirely in userspace, and the client runs on windows xp+ and osx 10.7+...</p><p>You can download the server from <a href="http://www.virtualhere.com/usb_server_software">http://www.virtualhere.com/usb_server_software</a> </p><p>and the client from <a href="http://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software">http://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software</a></p><p>Give a try and see if you find it useful, at the moment it is compiled for AR7xxx/9xxx and x86 but i can compile it for other platforms.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>msbroadf</strong> on 28 Jan 2014, 05:26)</p>

					<p>Maybe it&#039;s closed (commercial), but it works much better then &quot;standard&quot; USB/IP on OWRT, which is very unstable.<br />I use it for sharing multifunctional printer.

					<p>That does indeed look cool. But not being open source will preclude its ever being incorporated in OpenWRT... or I assume that&#039;s the case.</p>									</div>
