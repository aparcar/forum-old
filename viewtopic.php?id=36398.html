					<p>I&#039;d like monitor the usage of each of the computers/xboxes etc connecting to my router running openwrt.</p><p>I&#039;ve had a look at wrtbmon but it didn&#039;t work. It failed with syntax errors etc and I&#039;m not even sure which interface I need to monitor to capture adsl stats.</p><p>Does anyone have a suggestion as to which tool/package etc would give me the best results. I don&#039;t really need anything graphical. If I can get a per day result then I can graph it up etc.</p><p>M.</p>									</div>
