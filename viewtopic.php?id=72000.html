					<p>I have purchased a zsun WiFi memory card reader with the sole intentions of creating a OpenWRT dongle that I can use to act as a dedicated OpenVPN client so I can access my local network at home anywhere in the world I have wifi. </p><p>Now I have OpenWRT up and running just fine on the device, and its connected to my home wifi just fine, and broadcasting its own wifi network just fine as well. The issue comes when trying to setup the OpenVPN client. </p><p>The openVPN server is my Asus RT-AC68R, I have the server up and running, and have the exported config file from it. I can confirm it works because i have connected to it before from other devices. But I havent the faintest idea how to setup OpenWRT to do what I want, and the few posts I have found are way over my head, and most dont talk about TAP, only TUN. </p><p>Basically, I want the VPN connection to always be active, the whole idea is to exclusively use this little dongle as a tunnel into my home network. So I want all traffic routed through the VPN, and for the VPN to always be connected.</p>									</div>
