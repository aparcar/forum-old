					<p>Hey there, I hope, general discussion is an appropriate place to put this:</p><p>I recently purchased the Uyesee SoundMate M1 and am able to connect it to the WiFi network of my router. It is also shown as a DLNA device and streaming to it works without a problem. </p><p>But I also would like to use it as a kind of WiFi-repeater for my home network. And although devices that directly connect to the SoundMate&nbsp; can use the internet connection provided by my router, they can not be seen inside the local network.</p><p>I assume, this might be due to the fact that my router has the local IP of 192.168.2.1 and its DHCP server hands out addresses in the range of 192.168.2.100 -192.168.2.200, while the SoundMate itself also acts as a DHCP-Server but uses the address space of 192.168.222.xx.</p><p>The question is: How can I most conveniently join these two, apparently separated subnets? </p><p>My first attempt was to simply change the address and subnet of my router to 192.168.222.xxx, but this lead to the SoundMate being no longer recognized by the router.</p><p>The next try was to manipulate the firmware of the SoundMate itself . I can acces it via telnet, but I had no experience in fumbling with OpenWrt settings before, so my try-and-error attempts so far only forced me to do a couple of factory resets...</p><p>Ideally, my SoundMate would only serve as an access point and would leave all the IP juggling to the router. Is that possible? Does anyone know how I would have to tweak the settings? I will add the current settings (default, except for activated encryption and connection to router WiFi)</p><p><strong>/etc/config/powertools</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;system&#039;

					<p>The Soundmate is the AP behind the OpenWRT router.&nbsp; I see this as a soundmate issue, and has nothing to do with OpenWRT.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that the Soundmate has somewhere in the config some ability to change the IP or operating scenario from what appears to be &quot;Router&quot; (gets an ip from your lan, but doles out IP in another subnet) to something else.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; I see no need to telnet or ssh to the Soundmate, just log in and go to the management page which appears to be at 192.168.222.254. page 7, item 4 suggest there are other operating modes, but in general the document is clear as MUD.&nbsp; Is there more config under Basic or advanced settings??</p><p>All said, I see no place that this indicates that it can or is intended to be used as a wireless router for its clients.&nbsp; Seems reasonable, and maybe it can, but it looks like its just a music hub that needs to connect to the internet to update content (Gracenotes or similar)</p>									</div>

					<p>I have to resume this thread because I still didn&#039;t get it to work properly and it&#039;s driving me crazy.</p><p>I simply can not get the two networks to work both directions, which means:</p><p>If I leave the default settings, the devices connected to the soundmate belong to the 192.168.222 subnet. They can access the internet via the gateway of the original 192.168.2 subnet but are invisible to any device belonging to this subnet.</p><p>However, if I simply change the IP address of my original router to 192.168.222.1 and by that change the subnet of the connected devices to 192.168.222., the soundmate is no langer accessable as a streaming device.</p><p>What am I missing here? Has it somethicng to do with the fact that the soundmate apparently has two separate wifi devices and one has to act just as a regular client while the other provides an access point?</p><p>EDIT: I have solved it.
