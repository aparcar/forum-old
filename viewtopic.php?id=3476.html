					<p>Hi folks,</p><p>to anyone who is intereseted in a centralized management of wrt&#039;s in a network, please check</p><p><a href="http://open.megabit.net">http://open.megabit.net</a>/</p><p>Our new webinterface netWRT has just been released in a first pre-version but has already reached its main aims:<br />- allows to (un)set *any* nvram variable via a secure ssh channel (key-based authentication)<br />- all variables are dynamically stored in a database and grouped into logical units (LAN, WAN, WLAN etc.)<br />- each variable can have dependencies or conflicts set (e.g. to ensure that someone does not use WEP and WPA at the same time)<br />- comes with a standard-set of commonly used variables (lan_*, wan_* etc.)<br />- allows grouping of multiple devices and has the possibility to set selected variables group-wide (e.g. change the WEP key for all devices in the group)</p><p>Unfortunatly, it does have some more requirements than usual:<br />- tested with Apache 1.3.x and PHP 4.x (safe_mode disabled)<br />- MySQL Database (tested with 3.22)<br />- SSH(-Client)<br />- expect (which needs tcl installed)</p><p>plans for future releases:<br />- improvement of user interface<br />- transfer of existing configuration into the database</p><p>Feel free to play around with it, we appreciate as much feedback as we can get!</p>									</div>
