					<p>Hi... I found all the docs on implementing MAC filters, thanks.</p><p>However, either I&#039;m missing an extra step in enabling the MAC filters, or they&#039;re not supported in my configuration.<br />I don&#039;t use the WAN port, instead I just have the wireless clients on the same LAN as the wired ones (i.e.,<br />I have the LAN cable plugged into the row of 4 jacks, not the WAN one).&nbsp; I can enter<br />&#039;wlc ifname wl0 maclist &quot;xx:xx:....&quot;&#039;, and then &#039;wlc ifname wl0 macfilter 1&#039; to deny.&nbsp; But the named MAC address<br />can continue to access the net.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried up/down via wlc after entering this, but still no luck.</p><p>So does anybody else use MAC filtering in this kind of configuration?&nbsp; Did filtering ever work for you?<br />I&#039;ve tried 7.07 and 7.09, with identical results.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Andy Valencia</p>									</div>

					<p>Ugh... no nibbles at all.&nbsp; A little more info--this is a WRT54Gv2.2.&nbsp; Has anybody ever skipped the<br />WAN port AND gotten MAC filtering to work?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Andy.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not familiar with your platform (I use AR7) but have you considered using ebtables?&nbsp; I assume there is a Linux bridge device combining the wireless and wired interfaces?</p><p>Of course, filtering won&#039;t work for traffic between the wired LAN ports unless you break them into VLANs and then bridge them back together in software...</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt; I assume there is a Linux bridge device combining the wireless and wired interfaces?</p><p>Right, default config has the four LAN ports and the wireless interface all bridged together.<br />MAC filtering is done with the wc/wlc commands, directly on the wireless interface, so I expect<br />this level of MAC filtering is done in the wireless interface itself.&nbsp; Which would be great, if<br />only it worked!</p>									</div>
