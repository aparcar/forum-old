					<p>You will have to install the cable driver first, if you have windows, but don&#039;t expect me to lead you by hand, you seem to be missing elementary knowledge how do things work, so if you don&#039;t know something, try to write a question to google.com search bar first and you will see you can find some how-to for beginners.</p><p>Quick google gave me this: <a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/Nokia-DKU5-Cable-Driver/1106613223/1">http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/No … 06613223/1</a></p><p>Of course, that dku 5 is different from ca 42, so why have you bought the dku 5? You might have perfectly seen, how to do it with ca42, now you will have to find by pinout page to assign the correct pins, or you will have to find another video with dku 5 cable, if there&#039;s such. I don&#039;t have this cable, so I can&#039;t tell you which color comes where, but you should find it yourself anyway, because colors of different cable manufacturers might differ, so be sure to dissassemble the nokia pop port to see which color is connected to what pin and write it down before you will unsolder them and connect to your your router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;d suggest to install ubuntu, cable works out of the box, at least ca 42 worked for me. You can try to boot live usb distro first, but you will also need to install tftp server and I don&#039;t know if you will succeed with installing anything, when you are running only live usb. From linux terminal you can connect to router via command &quot;screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200&quot; (or some other ttyUSBnumber), or you can use putty as on windows.</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s something wrong with your windows or drivers, maybe some part of a corrupted driver is still present, it might be sometimes hard to get rid of the wrong drivers. You can try some old system restore point, from before you ever used the cable, then try other driver, restore again, and so on.</p><p>On linux, it should be much easier, download ubuntu live image and burn live dvd, or create live usb flash disk with utility from pendrivelinux. I don&#039;t know, if you can install some missing packages onto live usb, but you should give it a try.</p>									</div>

dd if=orig.bin of=tplink.bin skip=257 bs=512

mtd -r write /tmp/tplink.bin firmware</code></pre></div><br /><p>1. Would this method work for TL-WR740N V4 and firmware wr740nv4_en_3_16_6_up_<strong>boot</strong>(130529).bin as well?<br />2.
