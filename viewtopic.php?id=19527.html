					<p>Hi,<br /> I&#039;m wondering if anyone has tried to put OpenWrt on an ICYBOX IB-NAS4220-B?</p><p>I currently use Kamikaze on a WRT54GL (V2) and am really pleased with it.<br />I&#039;m curious to see if I might also be able to get it on the NAS box.<br />The main driver for this is that at the moment it&#039;s a real pain to do any configuration changes - the Web based UI is extremely limited, and it&#039;s not easy to change outside it - the NAS uses sausalito for config management, which is a complete nightmare. A trivial change such as modifying /etc/passwd or /etc/group involves modifying or creating instances of object classes in it&#039;s oodb&nbsp; (CODB).</p><p>regards,<br /> Eddy</p><p>---<br />Some info on the box:<br />nas&gt; uname -a<br />Linux nas.lan 2.6.15 #140 Fri Sep 7 10:29:15 CST 2007 armv4l GNU/Linux<br />nas&gt; cat /proc/cpuinfo<br />Processor&nbsp; &nbsp; : FA526id(wb) rev 1 (v4l)<br />BogoMIPS&nbsp; &nbsp; : 230.19<br />Features&nbsp; &nbsp; : swp half <br />CPU implementer&nbsp; &nbsp; : 0x66<br />CPU architecture: 4<br />CPU variant&nbsp; &nbsp; : 0x0<br />CPU part&nbsp; &nbsp; : 0x526<br />CPU revision&nbsp; &nbsp; : 1<br />Cache type&nbsp; &nbsp; : write-back<br />Cache clean&nbsp; &nbsp; : cp15 c7 ops<br />Cache lockdown&nbsp; &nbsp; : format B<br />Cache format&nbsp; &nbsp; : Harvard<br />I size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 16384<br />I assoc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 2<br />I line length&nbsp; &nbsp; : 16<br />I sets&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 512<br />D size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 8192<br />D assoc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 2<br />D line length&nbsp; &nbsp; : 16<br />D sets&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 256<br />Hardware&nbsp; &nbsp; : GeminiA<br />Revision&nbsp; &nbsp; : 0000<br />Serial&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : 0000000000000000<br />nas&gt; cat /proc/meminfo | head -1 <br />MemTotal:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;125296 kB<br />nas&gt; df -aHT<br />Filesystem&nbsp; &nbsp; Type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Size&nbsp; &nbsp;Used&nbsp; Avail Use% Mounted on<br />rootfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rootfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17M&nbsp; &nbsp; 14M&nbsp; &nbsp;3.2M&nbsp; 81% /<br />/dev/root&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ext2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17M&nbsp; &nbsp; 14M&nbsp; &nbsp;3.2M&nbsp; 81% /<br />/proc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;proc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; /proc<br />/sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sysfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; /sys<br />usbfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; usbfs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; /proc/bus/usb<br />/dev/md0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ext3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;104M&nbsp; &nbsp; 17M&nbsp; &nbsp; 82M&nbsp; 17% /system<br />/dev/md1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ext3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;492G&nbsp; &nbsp;240M&nbsp; &nbsp;467G&nbsp; &nbsp;1% /mnt/md1</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>I have a Raidsonic IcyBox IB-NAS4210-B. I wonder if there is some work on these NAS-es to make them work with openwrt. I found some links. You can check them on <br /><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/ib-nas4210-b">http://sites.google.com/site/fratzicu/ib-nas4210-b</a></p><p>I found the sourceforge project that looks promising, they have a config file for the image generator. I never succeeded to compile a firmware. And even if I succeeded, I would be a kind of afraid to perform the flashing because, if it fails, I don&#039;t have the necessary tools to unbrick the NAS, and also not the necessary the time. I think this NAS has some factory restoring, but I think it works only with the current firmware.</p><p>The most annoying thing is that you can&#039;t actually make scripts that can be executed on startup. Unless the OpenWRT guys turn their attention also on those devices, I think we have to wait.</p><p>There is a linux target in the developpement branch called &quot;gemini&quot;. Maybe it could be started there. </p><p>I had some expeiance with a trendnet router, but it had a failsafe interface to install te firmware. So, even if The flashing failed, I was able to restore it simply by pressing a reset button at boot and then accessing via web interface the firmware flashing procedure.</p><p>Anyway, some guys succeeded to compile an image in 2008, but then all the links to download them just got broken, anyway those were alfa releases.</p><p>Maybe some forum user has those files or did some work on the Cortina Systems/Storlink devices (cs3512/sl3512 or cs35xx/sl35xx) and is willing t share the information with us.</p><p>Good luck</p>									</div>
