					<p>Hello,</p><p>Is there a way to turn my tp link mr3420&nbsp; running chaos calmer into a dumb AP with DHCP (no NAT)?<br />situation is as follows:<br />1. there is an existing cat5 network with a DHCP server enabled (172.16....)<br />2. The second network (192.168.1...) has DHCP disabled<br />3. I would like to setup the opnwrt router on the wired infrastructure and set up a wifi connection with DHCP for the second network (192.168.1...)<br />4. The gateway (192.168.1.1) should be able to see all the computers and IP addresses of the devices connected to the opnwrt router (they should not be masked by the router).<br />5. The dhcp server dishing out IP addresses on the LAN/WLAN interface of the router shouldnt interfere with the DHCP server on the wired network (172.16....)</p><p>Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can do that, you just set the dhcp options to tell the users to use the actual gateway and dns server.&nbsp; The default of course is&nbsp; the AP router that it is running on.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your reply. Could you pls give me some directions about <br />1. setting the dhcp server options - I only see the address pool range, not the option to specify the gateway nor the DNS, in effect the dhcp uses the routers interface ip as the gateway for the connected clients.</p><p>2. How do I disble NAT to prevent the router from masking the IP of clients connected to it? also making sure the dhcp server running on the router doesnt start dishing out IP to clients connected to first network (172.16....)</p>									</div>

					<p>You would have to use numeric tagged options in the extra options field.&nbsp; 3 is the router and 6 the DNS server.</p><p>NAT already does not occur within the same firewall zone, which would be the case going from your AP device to ethernet over a bridge.</p>									</div>

					<p>Kindly find the network diagram link below, unfortunatey the forum doesnt allow me to embedd it.</p><p>i.imgur.com/acDKk8l.png</p><p>I need help configuring the Openwrt router in such a way that,<br />1. It gives connected clients (wifi and lan ) IP addresses but does not give out IP addresses to the other network computers.<br />2. The gateway&nbsp; sees each device connected to the openwrt router with its unique IP and MAC. (no NAT)</p>									</div>

					<p>If you bridge everything together there&#039;s no way to prevent the 172.x server from reponding to a DHCP request from one of your router&#039;s users, and putting it on the wrong network.&nbsp; The obvious answer is to use two switches or a managed switch to separate the two networks.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can&#039;t do that the second best answer is to NAT to the 192.168.1.1 service.</p><p>There may be a way to control packets going through the bridge at layer 2 and deny anything from reaching the 172 server; I have no experience with that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 12 Mar 2017, 16:57)</p>

					<p>Starting from the default configuration for OpenWrt (WAN is DHCP client, and LAN is DHCP server at 192.168.1.1), just connect the WAN port from the OpenWrt device to the switch, and the clients to the LAN ports. Now you have two networks, as per your diagram, and computers on the 192.168.1.x network should <em>see</em> computers on the 172.16.1.x network. Does that work?</p><p>Now, you can configure the OpenWrt device to route instead of masquerade; just disable it on LuCI at the &quot;firewall&quot; page, and the traffic from network 2 will just jump to network 1. However... is the main router configured to expect traffic from network 1 on its LAN interface?</p>									</div>
