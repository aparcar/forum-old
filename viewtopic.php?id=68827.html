					<p>Hello friends,</p><p>I am trying to cross compile a package for openwrt. I am using the &quot;OpenWrt-SDK-15.05.1-ramips-mt7688_gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2.Linux-x86_64.tar.bz2&quot; SDK. </p><p>I faced the missing dependencies problem. This is the error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Package beacon_server is missing dependencies for the following libraries:
libc.so.6
libpaho-mqtt3c.so.1
libwebsockets.so.9</code></pre></div><p>Actually i also faced the missing dependencies for this library.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>libbluetooth.so.3</code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; But i solved it with adding this line to the makefile.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>DEPENDS:=+bluez-libs</code></pre></div><p>&nbsp; But i cant solve these libraries. So can you help me for this problem?</p><p>This is the Makefile for my package</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>##############################################
# OpenWrt Makefile for helloworld program
#
#
# Most of the variables used here are defined in
# the include directives below. We just need to 
# specify a basic description of the package, 
# where to build our program, where to find 
# the source files, and where to install the 
# compiled program on the router. 
# 
# Be very careful of spacing in this file.
# Indents should be tabs, not spaces, and 
# there should be no trailing whitespace in
# lines that are not commented.

##############################################

include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

# Name and release number of this package
PKG_NAME:=beacon_server
PKG_RELEASE:=1


# This specifies the directory where we&#039;re going to build the program.  
# The root build directory, $(BUILD_DIR), is by default the build_mipsel 
# directory in your OpenWrt SDK directory
PKG_BUILD_DIR := $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PKG_NAME)


include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/package.mk



# Specify package information for this program. 
# The variables defined here should be self explanatory.
# If you are running Kamikaze, delete the DESCRIPTION 
# variable below and uncomment the Kamikaze define
# directive for the description below
define Package/beacon_server

    CATEGORY:=Utilities
    TITLE:=beacon_server -- prints a snarky message
    DEPENDS:=+bluez-libs +libc +libmosquitto +libmosquitto-nossl

# Uncomment portion below for Kamikaze and delete DESCRIPTION variable above
define Package/beacon_server/description
    If you can&#039;t figure out what this program does, you&#039;re probably
    brain-dead and need immediate medical attention.
endef



# Specify what needs to be done to prepare for building the package.
# In our case, we need to copy the source files to the build directory.
# This is NOT the default.  The default uses the PKG_SOURCE_URL and the
# PKG_SOURCE which is not defined here to download the source from the web.
# In order to just build a simple program that we have just written, it is
# much easier to do it this way.
define Build/Prepare
    mkdir -p $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)
    $(CP) ./src/* $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/
endef


# We do not need to define Build/Configure or Build/Compile directives
# The defaults are appropriate for compiling a simple program such as this one


# Specify where and how to install the program. Since we only have one file, 
# the helloworld executable, install it by copying it to the /bin directory on
# the router. The $(1) variable represents the root directory on the router running 
# OpenWrt. The $(INSTALL_DIR) variable contains a command to prepare the install 
# directory if it does not already exist.  Likewise $(INSTALL_BIN) contains the 
# command to copy the binary file from its current location (in our case the build
# directory) to the install directory.
define Package/beacon_server/install
    $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/bin
    $(INSTALL_BIN) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/beacon_server $(1)/bin/
endef


# This line executes the necessary commands to compile our program.
# The above define directives specify all the information needed, but this
# line calls BuildPackage which in turn actually uses this information to
# build a package.

					<p>you&#039;ll need to do some googling to find the proper syntax for the dependencies, in the meantime, a quick and dirty way to bypass these errors is to compile with the -i (ignore errors) flag. just add it to the end of you compile instruction...</p><p>make package/&lt;package name&gt;/compile V=99 -i</p><p>keep in mind this will ignore ALL errors so use it wisely ....</p>									</div>
