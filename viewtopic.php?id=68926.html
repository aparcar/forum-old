					<p>Hi,</p><p>Bought a <a href="http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/Archer-VR400.html">TP-Link Archer VR400</a> hoping to flash it with OpenWRT.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t paying attention and thought it was the same as the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500">Archer C5</a> but its not since its got ADSL/VDSL (which I need as I&#039;ve Fiber-To-The Cabinet) and only one USB port.</p><p>Struggling to find hardware details, none are on the above product page and nothing in the <a href="http://static.tp-link.com/res/down/doc/Archer_VR400(EU)_V1_UG.pdf">User Guide</a>.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-detection">DD-WRT Documentation suggests using the FCC ID</a> but there aren&#039;t any.</p><p>Anyone come across these routers and/or know anything about the hardware and the status of OpenWRT support?</p><p>With the default factory firmware there appears to be an SSH server running but I can&#039;t figure out what the username/password combination are to log in.&nbsp; If anyone has experience of similar devices and can suggest combinations that would be appreciated and might allow me to identify what hardware there is.</p><p>In the mean time I&#039;ve also requested this information (hardware and SSH username/password) from TP-Link Tech Support, I&#039;ll update when I hear from them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried looking for the source code in the <a href="http://uk.tp-link.com/gpl-code.html">GPL Code Centre</a> but the device is not listed (something I&#039;ll be letting Tech Support know when I hear from them).</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slack---line</strong> on 13 Dec 2016, 10:39)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve received responses from TP-Link technical support, so updating here, although not looking too promising.</p><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p><p>One person from tech support wrote...</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Sincerely sorry that we cannot provide the information of RAM, processor, processor speed&nbsp; , and others involving the commercial confidentiality.</p></blockquote></div><p>...which seems nonsense to me.&nbsp; Another from Tech Support provided the following...</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>For the chipset of the processor and wireless:<br />CPU: BCM63167UKREBG<br />Wireless&nbsp; &nbsp; : BCM63167UKREBG+BCM4352KMLG</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>SSH Access</strong></p><p>Feels like they&#039;re messing me about by refusing to provide username and password.&nbsp; They claim SSH access is limited to their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.tether&amp;hl=en">Tether App</a> but thats not my understanding of how SSH works, if there is a valid username and password for making an SSH connection that connection can be made from the command line or used for example for sFTP...</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Our router cannot support SSH commander. So you cannot visit the router via commands.</p><p>The firmware can support SSH because we added the support of Tether 2.0.<br />Tether 2.0 is an APP used to manage and configure routers; to guarantee the safety of the communication process; we use SSH to encrypt the data. So the SSH is available on the firmware.<br />Whatâ€™s more, we have already considered the security issue, and have already blocked the related SSH tunnels and commands, which makes this SSH available only to the Tether APP.&nbsp; Other SSH clients cannot control the router via commands. <br />So please rest assured that the SSH will never cause any safety issue on your device.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think I&#039;ll just refund this and get an alternative, if anyone has recommendations for VDSL Wifi Routers I&#039;m all ears.&nbsp; The Linksys WRT####AC family look nice (and pricey!), need to see if any have VDSL (I do have a VDSL modem I could place before the router but would rather have an all-in-one device).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, yes I found that out when researching yesterday but have a VDSL modem I can stick between the socket and the WRT1900ACS I&#039;ve now purchased.</p><p>Looking forward to getting stuck into OpenWRT again, been a long time since I used it on my old WRT54g(v1).</p>									</div>
