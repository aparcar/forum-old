					<p>I&#039;m writing to Chinese vendors trying to get an updated firmware (if one exists) however I am more than happy with the device now, I did have a static and popping when no sound was being played but I switched over to an Optical cable and it is now perfect. With regards to the IP, I think I had a bad flash before hence the web browser not coming up but everything under tho hood seemed fine, I think that holding down the reset button then allowing the firmware update was the trick here.</p>									</div>

					<p>No using the Soundmate M1 firmware I was not able to play audio files stored in the USB pendrive connected to the USB port. But although I was able to install the Soundmate M1 firmware, when using airplay from my Ipad there was more inconsistencies in the sound, like the processor was not able to process the sound as quickly as was needed. But after installing the Soundmate M1 firmware I was not able to change the firmware anymore. The moment I tried to upload another file (using the web interface), I got the message that the firmware was incorrect. I tried it via the telnet connection but that went wrong and I bricked the Airmusic device.</p>									</div>

					<p>My airmusic is also bricked. I bought a PL2303 cable and connected the Airmusic with my computer. Using putty or hyperterminal I was able to see the booting, but it took me a day to find the command to get in to the u-boot shell. I tried every option I could find on the internet for more than a day. Finally I only typed &quot;n&quot; during boot and then I got the shell. </p><p>Using help I could get the basic information</p><p>hornet&gt; ?</p><p>?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- alias for &#039;help&#039;<br />bootm&nbsp; &nbsp;- boot application image from memory<br />cp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - memory copy<br />erase&nbsp; &nbsp;- erase FLASH memory<br />help&nbsp; &nbsp; - print online help<br />httpd&nbsp; &nbsp; - start webserver<br />md&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - memory display<br />mm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - memory modify (auto-incrementing)<br />mtest&nbsp; &nbsp;- simple RAM test<br />mw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - memory write (fill)<br />nm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - memory modify (constant address)<br />printenv- print environment variables<br />progmac - Set ethernet MAC addresses<br />reset&nbsp; &nbsp;- Perform RESET of the CPU<br />setenv&nbsp; - set environment variables<br />tftpboot- boot image via network using TFTP protocol<br />version - print monitor version<br />hornet&gt; version</p><br /><p>U-Boot 1.1.5 (Nov&nbsp; 8 2013 - 15:17:08)<br />hornet&gt; printenv</p><p>bootargs=console=ttyS0,115200 root=31:02 rootfstype=squashfs init=/sbin/init mtdparts=ar7240-nor0:128k(u-boot),1024k(kernel),6912(rootfs),64k(config),64k(ART)<br />bootcmd=bootm 0x9f020000<br />bootdelay=1<br />baudrate=115200<br />ethaddr=0xba:0xbe:0xfa:0xce:0x07:0x41<br />ipaddr=192.168.222.6<br />serverip=192.168.222.10<br />ram_addr=0x80060000<br />kernel_addr=0x9f020000<br />stdin=serial<br />stdout=serial<br />stderr=serial<br />ethact=eth0</p><p>Environment size: 391/65532 bytes</p><p>But I haven&#039;t found how I can upload the new firmware through the serial line (as the device doesn&#039;t have a ethernet connection).

					<p>I think I found a solution. A python script that can use mw within the u-boot software. There are a few pages. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54269.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=54269.</a> In essence one opens the router with a screen command, kills the screen, but the router is already connected. Then you run a python script that just copies all the bytes to the router. And finally you copy the data to you flash memory.</p><p>My computer is still copying, I will update this when I&#039;m finished.</p>									</div>

					<p>To update on my progress of the work on 2 January. I made a mistake in the copying address as you can read in my previous post. I did it again and now the unit starts. But it seems that I damaged my ART file in the process because I get an error message during boot.</p><p>ath: phy0: Unable to initialize hardware; initialization status: -5<br />ath9k ar933x_wmac: failed to initialize device<br />ath9k: probe of ar933x_wmac failed with error -5</p><p>So now I need an ART file to repair the unit. Can anyone send me a copy of his ART file? In the post <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/restore_art_partition">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/restore_art_partition</a> they give instructions how you can make a dump of the art file. </p><p>I hope someone can help me.</p>									</div>

					<p>Isn&#039;t the ART partition specifically tuned for every single device? I think it holds calibration data... don&#039;t you still have the original chip so that you could read it from there?</p>									</div>
