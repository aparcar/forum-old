					<p>The custom build of RedBoot for the ActionTec MI424WR linked from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/mi424wr">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/mi424wr</a> is no longer available.&nbsp; Apparently Verizon recently decommissioned the &quot;Site Pages&quot; function where it was hosted.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to locate an alternate source.&nbsp; Does anyone still have this handy, or is can someone familiar with the build process rebuild it?</p><p>I could host the file, if someone else can provide it.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather avoid the work of building it myself if someone else already has the tools in place.</p>									</div>
