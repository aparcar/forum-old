					<p>install luci-app-qos and you can specify your internet speed. You could limit to 2mbit, but you&#039;re better off letting QOS do it&#039;s thing to keep latency low for all applications, without artificially limiting your bandwidth so much.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 6 Nov 2014, 01:49)</p>

					<p>I installed, but it never limits bandwidth in speed tests.<br />How do I configure it via command?<br />I have been playing call of duty warfare advanced, but the lag compensation is hurting me. I prefer to reduce the bandwidth to play, so I may be favored.

					<p>Hi pilovis,</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>pilovis wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Qos do not limit bandwidth, use instead wshaper (Wondershaper).</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install luci-app-wshaper</p><p>wondershaper is an easy to use traffic shaping script that provides these improvements:</p><p>* Low latency for interactive traffic (and pings) at all times<br />* Allow websurfing at reasonable speeds while uploading / downloading<br />* Make sure uploads don&#039;t hurt downloads<br />* Make sure downloads don&#039;t hurt uploads</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, the openWrt package qos-scripts does include a traffic shaping component in addition to the traditional qos marking component and should do what the OP wanted; unless there is a bug somewhere or it failed to start properly. The posts do not contain enough information to figure this out (as much as I would like to help, I have currently no stock openwrt system to actually be able to test any recommendations).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regarding wonder shaper, it seems that it got a bit long in the tooth and either qos-scripts or sqm-scripts should do much better; see <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Wondershaper_Must_Die">http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cer â€¦ r_Must_Die</a> for a reasoning why wonder shaper should be considered more as a historic &quot;stepping stone&quot; towards a better solution and less of a recommendation for AQM/QOS today...</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
