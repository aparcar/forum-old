					<p>Hi, I own the excellent Gl.iNet 6416A router, and it has a great interface for automatically creating a transparent ssh proxy. You just put in your login details and ssh key, and magically all your traffic gets routed through your SSH tunnel. Super useful.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wqy3yhtvo43cgsg/hu38np4w.png" alt="Gl.Inet screnshot" /></span></p><p>Is there an equivalent Luci package that can accomplish this feat so that people who don&#039;t have a Gl.Inet device can easily set up this kind of setup?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am of the opinion that only GL.iNet makes an alternative GUI for their OpenWRT releases.&nbsp; There is no documentation that I have seen on the features/changes/enhancements/config for their GUI.</p><p>I have only found a couple of vendors that include OpenWRT with their hardware.&nbsp; Here is another, <a href="http://www.zbtlink.com/list.aspx?cp_id=486">http://www.zbtlink.com/list.aspx?cp_id=486</a> , but there is no info on the GUI.</p><p>This is the only real NEW GUI I have found so far, but you need to build it.&nbsp; Not clear what it adds for functionality<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59439">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59439</a></p><p>What I would like to see is an IOS/Android App, especially to config wifi.</p><p>Have you successfully used this tool?&nbsp; If so did you connect to another OpenWRT server?</p>									</div>

					<p>There isn&#039;t anything similar. My suggestion would be to create an init script that starts the SSH connection, adds transparent proxy iptables rules and respawns (procd) on disconnection.</p>									</div>

					<p>The ssh-proxy feature and the GUI do look pretty cool. Wish OpenWRT had these <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
