					<p>I am overwhelmed by the volume of instructions for installing openwrt on the captioned device.&nbsp; The Table of Hardware current release lists &quot;external image&quot; and a dropbox link is provided to a tarred version of the OEM Firmware GPL source code.&nbsp; </p><p>I assumed that if I create a file from this it will be in the form of an image which I can then install from the web admin page of the device.&nbsp; However it does not seem to be that simple.&nbsp; There are two instructions in the README document:-</p><p>&quot;Please use &quot;make menuconfig&quot; to configure your appreciated<br />configuration for the toolchain and firmware.&quot; and</p><p>&quot;Simply running &quot;make&quot; will build your firmware.<br />It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, <br />the kernel and all choosen applications.&quot;</p><p>I have no idea what configuration I want for the toolchain or firmware.&nbsp; All I need is to be able to create a reliable image which the device will upload and install as if it were an Engenius update.</p><p>If I read the 4 + 15 further pages on installation I am even more confused especially as some have warnings about bricking the device.</p><p>Please could somebody give me some clarification and assurances here.</p>									</div>
