					<p>I also have this specific router and the only reason i keep it is because of the probability to run openwrt.<br />I and many other Greek people suffer from disconnections from the ISP every five minutes or so. We have contacted many times with Linksys support and they don&#039;t seem to release new firmware to fix the problem. (current version is 1.01.05)<br />And i think Linksys is going to release a new WAG354G v2.0. That&#039;s a nice way to keep sales up. When something doesn&#039;t work they just make a new product and vaptise it v2.0.</p><p>Anyway, probably many of you don&#039;t care about my problems, but i&#039;m pissed off and i want somewhere to tell my experiences with Linksys.</p><p>Are there any news, as far as it concerns Wag354g running openwrt?</p>									</div>
