					<p>Hey all! </p><p>I&#039;m using OpenWRT Chaos Calmer snapshot r42649 and am trying to make a little HooToo router I have work as a new AP off of an existing wireless network. Our existing wireless network, for example, is called &quot;CS50&quot;, and I would like to create a new wireless network using CS50&#039;s signal and call it OpenWRT that can broadcast at the same time, borrowing the signal. However, I&#039;m finding that when I connect to CS50 via the Interfaces section in the GUI, it&#039;s overriding the device&#039;s own SSID and mirroring CS50, which isn&#039;t the desired behavior. The goal is basically to create my own private little network using the wireless signal from CS50. Help in getting this working would be greatly appreciated; I&#039;m unsure if maybe I&#039;m missing a setting somewhere that&#039;s causing it to mirror. Thank you!</p><p>Best,<br />Colton</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Colton,</p><p>Just to be clear you want to &quot;extend&quot; the CS550 coverage with your OpenWRT router, or you want to bridge the CS550 wireless signal to wired ports on the OpenWRT router?</p><p>Don&#039;t see how you can do the former, the later is pretty easily done.</p><p>Craig...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Craig,</p><p>Thanks for the reply! I essentially want to avoid wired Ethernet altogether. I&#039;d like to extend the network but be able to use a new SSID with the device rather than have it take the same SSID as the network I&#039;m extending. If I&#039;m in the office, I&#039;d like to use the signal from &quot;CS50&quot; and create &quot;Colton&#039;s Network&quot; or the like.</p><p>Best,<br />Colton</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want to have your HooToo on the same subnet as CS50 then you want to use relayd (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/relayclient</a>). </p><p>If you want your own private LAN on a separate subnet, then you pretty much just need to set the LAN side IP address to something other then CS50 and connect the WWAN via Luci-Wifi.</p>									</div>

I think what we want is the latter. However, when I scan and try to associate a Wifi network with the device, I don&#039;t get any signal once connected. It also replaces the SSID of the device (which is OpenWrt by default) to the name of the network I&#039;m connecting to (CS50), whereas I&#039;m trying to actually create a newly named access point. Any thoughts on why it&#039;s behaving as such? Thank you so much!</p><p>Best,<br />Colton</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>coltonoscopy</strong> on 28 Mar 2016, 23:37)</p>

I ended up finding a video on what I wanted to do, which was create a wireless repeater. Turns out it&#039;s super easy; first, scan to join the right network, make sure 40 MHz is chosen in the advanced settings for reasons I don&#039;t know, which will then trigger the signal flowing through, then add a new network underneath that using the LAN interface, and it will be listed as a &quot;Master&quot; network, whereas the first one we scanned was listed as a &quot;Client&quot;. Then it just works. Appreciate the help!</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbsh2zxPnk</a></p><p>Best,<br />Colton</p>									</div>

					<p>There are 2 processes, not documented anywhere that I know of, for &quot;managing&quot; wireless connections.&nbsp; The results are the same, the actions are different.&nbsp; The method in the video wipes ALL your connections, where as the method I was suggesting retains the existing WLAN config.&nbsp; This is important if you are using a travel router and no ability to connect with a Ethernet cable.&nbsp; Detailed steps are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>1. From Luci&gt;&gt;Network&gt;&gt;Wifi select the &quot;Remove&quot; for the Client, followed by &quot;OK&quot; to the &quot;Really delete this wireless interface...&quot; dialog box.<br />2. Select &quot;Scan&quot;<br />3. Select the &quot;Join Network&quot; button for the desired network.<br />4. Uncheck the &quot;Replace wireless configuration&quot; check box. Enter the &quot;WPA passphrase&quot;. Select &quot;Submit&quot;.<br />5. Click &quot;Save &amp; Apply&quot;</p></li></ul><p>The AP configuration is not impacted with this process. </p><p>I suggest you get and save a working config, and then familiarize yourself with the process for configuring your wireless connections if you plan on traveling with the device.</p><p>Regarding the channel, be careful.&nbsp; You may or may not need\want this.&nbsp; It depends on the device(s) you are connecting to.&nbsp; The video demonstrates connecting to a device with a 40mhz band available.&nbsp; It should still work with 20, but will not be as fast.&nbsp; Not sure what will happen if you set this to 40 and the STAtion ONLY is in 20.&nbsp; Did it not work if you accepted the default?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RangerZ</strong> on 29 Mar 2016, 16:47)</p>
