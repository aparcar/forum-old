					<p>I want to put OpenWRT on an EasyBox 803. As far as I understood there is no way to flash the box without openening and a serial to USB adapter. The adapter has to be special because the serial interface on the board uses 3V only. Where can I get such an adapter or which chipset should it have?</p><p>I&#039;m not sure if I can drop my splitter and that my ISDN phones work with the EasyBox. I read some articles that talked about asterix software that is required. Is the splitter part of the EasyBox done with software? I don&#039;t want to use IP phone, I simply want to plug in the ISDN cables of my phones.</p><p>There is a wiki page about this box. But, there are posts who bricked their box following the instructions. Does the current version work? Any experience?</p><p>There is a new version of OpenWRT (BARRIER BREAKER) which nears completion. Is it working with the EasyBox or should I stay with the old version of the wiki?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have a serial to USB adapter with 5V, you can adopt it with a voltage divider to 3V. But with some interfaces it might not work. I have done this successfully with an Arduino Board, which I am using as a serial interface.</p><p>Asterisk only works on this box, if you extend the root. But I have no experience with ISDN.</p><p>Both Barrier Breaker and the trunk version Chaos Calmer work with my 803, but probably you have to build your own images.</p><p>If the box is going to be bricked, there is still a way to load a firmware as described in the wiki. I recommend to buy a second 803 to play with it. It is very cheap now.</p>									</div>

However, when it comes to a USB/Serial console adapter, there are lots of inexpensive <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-USB-Serial.html?site=glo&amp;groupsort=1&amp;SortType=price_asc&amp;SearchText=USB+Serial&amp;initiative_id=SB_20140916065239&amp;shipCountry=us&amp;filterCat=400103,4099,200004732&amp;isOnSale=yes&amp;isFreeShip=y">USB/Serial adapters</a> you can buy from China. For me, I just re-purpose the serial port on my old and free <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/fon/fonera">FON2100</a> WiFi router. All I did was to flash the device with a self-built OpenWRT firmware and did some tweaking on its /etc/inittab file (IIRC) so that its serial port can be used with minicom.</p>									</div>
