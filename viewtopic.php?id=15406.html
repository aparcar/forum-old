					<p>Hi,</p><p>I just installed Kamikaze 7.09 kernel 2.4 on my wl500gP after i had a working whiterussian 0.9 with Xwrt. </p><p>When i connect the wl500gP to my other DLINK router as a DHCP client (just as i would connect a computer) it will not get an IP, nor will it work with a fixed IP. whiterussian used to get an IP from the DLINK. it&#039;s using the same port (no connection changes).</p><p>direct connection to the DSL modem works fine, i get a WAN IP, ping and ipkg work OK.</p><br /><p>quick ASCII graphics here:</p><p>DSL --- wl500gP works<br />DSL --- DLINK DI 524 (DHCP) --- wl500gP does not get IP (used to work on whiterussian)</p><br /><p>the udhcpc is running on eth0.1 which appears to be the wan interface but ifconfig does not show an IP. doing ifdown / ifup on wan will be &quot;sending discover&quot; a few times and still no IP when connected on the router.</p><p>is there anything i can tune to have the wl500gP get the DHCP IP from the DLINK? what&#039;s the difference between the way whiterussian 0.9 vs Kamikaze 7.09 work?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
