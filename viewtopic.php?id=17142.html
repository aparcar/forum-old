        # address pool (10.8.0.0/255.255.255.0)
        # back to the OpenVPN server.

        # To assign specific IP addresses to specific
        # clients or if a connecting client has a private
        # subnet behind it that should also have VPN access,
        # use the subdirectory &quot;ccd&quot; for client-specific
        # configuration files (see man page for more info).

        # EXAMPLE: Suppose the client
        # having the certificate common name &quot;Thelonious&quot;
        # also has a small subnet behind his connecting
        # machine, such as 192.168.40.128/255.255.255.248.
        # First, uncomment out these lines:
#       option client_config_dir ccd
#       list route &quot;192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248&quot;
        # Then create a file ccd/Thelonious with this line:
        #   iroute 192.168.40.128 255.255.255.248
        # This will allow Thelonious&#039; private subnet to
        # access the VPN.  This example will only work
        # if you are routing, not bridging, i.e. you are
        # using &quot;dev tun&quot; and &quot;server&quot; directives.

        # EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to give
        # Thelonious a fixed VPN IP address of 10.9.0.1.
        # First uncomment out these lines:
#       option client_config_dir ccd
#       list route &quot;10.9.0.0 255.255.255.252&quot;
#       list route &quot;192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0&quot;
        # Then add this line to ccd/Thelonious:
        #   ifconfig-push &quot;10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2&quot;

        # Suppose that you want to enable different
        # firewall access policies for different groups
        # of clients.  There are two methods:
        # (1) Run multiple OpenVPN daemons, one for each
        #     group, and firewall the TUN/TAP interface
        #     for each group/daemon appropriately.
        # (2) (Advanced) Create a script to dynamically
        #     modify the firewall in response to access
        #     from different clients.  See man
        #     page for more info on learn-address script.
#       option learn_address ./script

        # If enabled, this directive will configure
        # all clients to redirect their default
        # network gateway through the VPN, causing
        # all IP traffic such as web browsing and
        # and DNS lookups to go through the VPN
        # (The OpenVPN server machine may need to NAT
        # the TUN/TAP interface to the internet in
        # order for this to work properly).
        # CAVEAT: May break client&#039;s network config if
        # client&#039;s local DHCP server packets get routed
        # through the tunnel.  Solution: make sure
        # client&#039;s local DHCP server is reachable via
        # a more specific route than the default route
        # of 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0.
#       list push &quot;redirect-gateway&quot;

        # Certain Windows-specific network settings
        # can be pushed to clients, such as DNS
        # or WINS server addresses.  CAVEAT:
        # http://openvpn.net/faq.html#dhcpcaveats
#       list push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 10.8.0.1&quot;
#       list push &quot;dhcp-option WINS 10.8.0.1&quot;

        # Uncomment this directive to allow different
        # clients to be able to &quot;see&quot; each other.
        # By default, clients will only see the server.
        # To force clients to only see the server, you
        # will also need to appropriately firewall the
        # server&#039;s TUN/TAP interface.
#       option client_to_client 1

        # Uncomment this directive if multiple clients
        # might connect with the same certificate/key
        # files or common names.  This is recommended
        # only for testing purposes.  For production use,
        # each client should have its own certificate/key
        # pair.
        #
        # IF YOU HAVE NOT GENERATED INDIVIDUAL
        # CERTIFICATE/KEY PAIRS FOR EACH CLIENT,
        # EACH HAVING ITS OWN UNIQUE &quot;COMMON NAME&quot;,
        # UNCOMMENT THIS LINE OUT.
#       option duplicate_cn 1

        # The keepalive directive causes ping-like
        # messages to be sent back and forth over
        # the link so that each side knows when
        # the other side has gone down.
