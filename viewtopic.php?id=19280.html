					<p>Hi, I am running the latest Kamikaze trunk - kernel 2.4 - on original Asus wl-500gP v1 HW and I am near to switch wifi chipset to Atheros 5k series. Before that will happen, I would like to ask some certaining questions for I&#039;ll be sure I&#039;ll not waste time , money and energy by doing this.</p><p>a/ I was not able run wifi with WEP encryption, is it broken, or I did something wrong? Does exist any tutorial or hints how to set it correct and working if it is possible.</p><p>b/ I had some problems with MAC filtering, from some reason I do not want apply wifi encryption, and when I applied macfiltering it worked from time to time. Does exist any exact tutorial how to set macfiltering on configuration i described at begin of this post?</p><p>c/ If do i will switch to Atheros wifi chipset, do I will fix those problems I mentioned above? Does it work with macfiltering and encryption well?</p><p>d/ If I will switch to Atheros, is better to install packages running on kernel 2.6 or stay with kernel 2.4 i am running relative fine right now? I am running USB device - SD card openwrt. Does 2.6 trunk changing kernel often? I want avoid situation when I must reflash router, I want just rewrite SD card.</p><p>Thank you much for any kind of useful answer</p>									</div>
