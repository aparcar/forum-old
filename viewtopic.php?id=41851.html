					<p>Hi all!</p><p>Here is my setup:<br />OpenWRT 12.09-rc1 on TP-Link TL-WDR4300<br />wan - 3G modem (fast access, but limited traffic)<br />wan2 - 3G modem (slow, but unlimited)<br />lan - local network NAT via &quot;wan&quot;<br />lan2 - optional (?) network NAT via &quot;wan2&quot;</p><p>Question:<br />How to reconfigure OpenWRT to route some lan host via &quot;wan2&quot; (slow but unlimited)? </p><p>If it is required I can add &quot;lan2&quot; network on VLAN and reconnect &quot;special&quot; hosts to &quot;lan2&quot;, but preferred solution is to keep all the hosts on &quot;lan&quot;. </p><p>I&#039;ve made some dual setups but traffic is routed via default &quot;wan&quot;...</p><p>any idea?</p><p>regards,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mikolaj</p>									</div>

					<p>What you want can be achieved on basis of source address routing, i.e. the decision on where to send packets is made on the basis of a test of the source address and/or source interface.<br />Two options: 1. you use a so called multi-wan script; several have been made by OpenWrt users and are available as package. They offer much more functionality than you want/need but it allows to define where traffic should go on basis of source address or source interface.<br />2. you write a script yourself; the package &#039;ip&#039; is needed to be able to define some custom defined routing tables and routing rules. Normally OpenWrt will have three tables defined that have a number and a name: 0 local, 32766 main, 32767 default. local and main will have been filled already on basis of your network definitions and the wan dynamics.<br />One way of doing what you want is by creating three additional tables , e.g. 200, 201, 203, and to fill 200 with routes that are in common for all sources (all destinations locally), 201 with one wan route as default, and 202 with the other wan route as default. Then you create rules that make all traffic go through the tests in 200 (which will not fit if the traffic has to go outside), the non fit makes the next rule apply which you define so its discriminates on source address or interface and chooses either table 201 or 202 that both have a default, but a different one! After writing such a script you&#039;ll have learned a lot about routing in Linux and the ip package! A lot of info can be found on <a href="http://www.policyrouting.org/">http://www.policyrouting.org/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>doddel</strong> on 24 Jan 2013, 16:46)</p>
