					<p>Taking a very quick look at pylon/smlogger, I see that it is a C program, not a script.&nbsp; Also it appears to be made to upload the data to the Google Power Meter server, which does not exist any more.&nbsp; It looks like it can get data from the E750 meter, but the other side that stores or otherwise handles the data will need to be written.&nbsp; That would be done on a PC then port the final version to a standalone machine like a router running OpenWrt.</p><p>You can port C programs to OpenWrt by writing a Makefile for OpenWrt&#039;s build system. I used the &quot;picocom&quot; package as an example of a package that is basically a single C file.</p>									</div>
