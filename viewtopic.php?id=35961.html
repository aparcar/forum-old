					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a couple of WNDR3800 I&#039;m trying to setup using openwrt 10.03.1.&nbsp; I wrote a setup script that does the required configuration and packages installation.</p><p>I often have the problem when I run my setup script where opkg is downloading a package.&nbsp; wget start to download a package and stop before the file is complete.&nbsp; wget is still in the process list but seem to be idling (no cpu usage and file size doesn&#039;t increase).&nbsp; If I try to download the same package with wget manually, it never hangs.&nbsp; I tried to replace the built-in wget with the wget package but the result is the same.</p><p>If I kill the wget process, opkg continue to install others packages.</p><p>Any idea?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>same thing just happened to me.&nbsp; wget process should ever hang indefinitely regardless of how bad the web server or network connection.&nbsp; I consider this a real bug and will report it as such.</p>									</div>
