					<p>I have been having this issue with the hardware and firmware which i can replicate easily </p><p><strong>Description with 2.4 kernel:</strong></p><p>After flashing the router and while in full default settings i change the lan ip to something like: ip: 10.0.0.20&nbsp; and netmask: 255.255.0.0</p><p><strong>Using luci: </strong></p><p>After reboot the router fails to assign&nbsp; an ip to a computer. Other times it the dhcp works giving the computer an ip like 10.0.0.113 but the router cannot be pinged, telneted or accessed with luci.</p><p><strong>Using cli:</strong></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.lan.ipaddr=10.0.0.20; uci set network.lan.netmask=255.255.0.0; uci commit network; reboot</code></pre></div><p>The result is the same. After reboot the router fails to assign&nbsp; an ip to a computer. Other times it the dhcp works giving the computer an ip like 10.0.0.113 but the router cannot be pinged, telneted or accessed with luci.</p><p><strong>Description with 2.4 kernel:</strong><br />Right after installing it; i decided to turn on the wireless using luci. </p><p><strong>Result :</strong><br />Same as with kernel 2.4. After reboot the router fails to assign&nbsp; an ip to a computer. Other times it the dhcp works giving the computer an ip like 10.0.0.113 but the router cannot be pinged, telneted or accessed with luci.</p><p><strong>Differences from 2.4 and 2.6:</strong></p><p>I was able to turn on the wireless with 2.4 and access it after.</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong><br />I used&nbsp; windows xp sp3; gentoo linux &amp; backtrack linux.</p><p>All times i was unable to connect&nbsp; i had to go on recover mode. In all tests i rebooted the operating systems and router.<br />All firmware builds are official from : <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc5/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1-rc5/</a></p><p><strong>My question:</strong></p><p>Anyone else has had the same or similar problem with Asus WL500 GP v2 ? Initially i thought this was GUI related or network only related.</p>									</div>
