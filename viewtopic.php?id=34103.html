					<p>So, took a side step and installed the Atheros wireless card.&nbsp; &nbsp;Deleted the wireless config as recommended.&nbsp; <br />OpenWRT sees the new card, but get the error &quot;not enabled or associated&quot; on the WLAN interface so it will not re-join.&nbsp; I have enabled the card, so it has something to do with the Assiciation?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Crashed it, starting over again.&nbsp; At least I made backup of the config.</p>									</div>
