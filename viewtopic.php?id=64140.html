					<p>Hi,</p><p>We are playing with hardware for LoWPANs and we would like to extend netifd functionality so it can handle wpan PHYs and WPAN interfaces.</p><p>From what we gathered, the proper way is to add wpan.c/wpan.h in netifd that would call iwpan (wpan-tools). We are thinking of adding /etc/config/wpan , similarly to /etc/config/wireless and reading the settings from there.</p><p>After we&#039;re done we would like to commit the changes upstream. Is there something we are missing and should acquaint ourselves with is the only thing that we need to extend the netifd? Are we missing something?</p><p>Our approach would be to setup phyX and wpanX from this config file - like page/channel and pan_id, etc.</p><p>Any advice is welcome.</p>									</div>
