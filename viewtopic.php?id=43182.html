					<p>I have a WDR3500 that I flashed with the firmware I found in this thread; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42292">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=42292</a></p><p>Everything works great, except LAN clients can&#039;t talk to eachother.&nbsp; Wifi clients can talk to LAN clients, but when I try to send packets from one wired desktop to another, they are mysteriously dropped.&nbsp; Even running tcpdump on my LAN bridge or straight on the eth0 interface doesn&#039;t show anything on the router.&nbsp; (Although on the desktops, I can see the packets leaving the computer)</p><p>Here is my /etc/config/network file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;
