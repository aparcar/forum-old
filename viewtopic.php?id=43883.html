After reading the full thread I&#039;m half excited and half curious. I&#039;ve got two EE Brighboxes lying around and want to make use of them for extending signal or file sharing. At first I&#039;ve read the unlocking trick to use with other ISPs from the thread link below and thought it has got some potential to have custom firmware and eventually after googling I found this openwrt thread.</p><p><a href="http://www.the-scream.co.uk/forums/t31206.html">http://www.the-scream.co.uk/forums/t31206.html</a></p><p>TBH, like said I&#039;m still confused on this device whether it fully supports OpenWRT or we&#039;ve to miss some features. Also I couldn&#039;t find the actual full instructions regarding the hacking to get the OpenWRT on to this. Some one has to guide me and hoping to get some help from you.</p><p>PS: BTW I&#039;m good at disassembling electronics and with some instructions I can do JTAG hacking.</p><p>Awaiting your reply.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
