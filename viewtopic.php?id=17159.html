					<p>We have been using a ASUS WL500gP(1) router with kamikaze 2.4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Problem we are facing is obsolescence, manufacture says product has reached end of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;Searched Openwrt Table&nbsp; of Hardware site for routers that have USB(2.0) and are supported.&nbsp; We found 2 other routers but, they are no longer manufactured.&nbsp; &nbsp;Our needs, a router that is supported (kamikaze), has at least 1 USB(2.0), 4meg flash and 16meg ram.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have tried to contact Openwrt Developers but, unsuccessful so far.&nbsp; Trying to find out if there been any updates to the router list or if there is a replacement&nbsp; router for our needs????</p><p>Appreciate anyones knowledge or experience on this issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wix</p>									</div>

					<p>1. You can use an ALIX board with or without wi-fi card. Is a bit more expensive than a simple router but is far more powerfull.<br />2. There is also the omnima board. Very cheap, but only 2MB Flash and no wifi.</p>									</div>

					<p>Very good question - those USB ports are really useful.&nbsp; I&#039;m sad to hear that they are becoming scarce.</p><p>The ASUS520GU has one USB port.&nbsp; It is smaller and cheaper then the ASUS you mentioned, and is widely available here in Canada.</p><p>And, like the previous poster, I would recommend the Alix boards (made by PC Engines) if you can handle a higher price point.</p>									</div>

					<p>Appreciate the feedback.&nbsp; Our application requires the unit to be a stand-alone wifi router with USB port.&nbsp; &nbsp;PC engine, Alix don&#039;t think it will easily meet our needs.&nbsp; The Linksys WRTSL54GS and Netgear WGT634U are discontinued from manufacturing.&nbsp; Have tried to contact Kamikaze developers to find out about updates to their Table Of Hardware List but, no luck so far......&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wix</p>									</div>

					<p>As a previous poster reported, the ASUS WL-520Gu is a good choice. I have one.&nbsp; It runs Kamikaze r12259.&nbsp; I had to compile that Kamikaze release from source, which was slow but painless.&nbsp; I use Linux 2.4. There are some more hints in the SupportedHardware wiki.&nbsp; At first I tried top-of-trunk and Linux 2.6, but that resulted in a nonresponsive router.&nbsp; Conservatively, I then picked something that someone else had already tried.</p><p>I don&#039;t use the wireless part, but it should work. </p><p>I connected a Phidgets InterfaceKit 0/0/8 to its USB port.&nbsp; It&#039;s a card with 8 USB-controlled relays.&nbsp; I had to cross-compile the library but that was also relatively painless.&nbsp; The only glitch was a missing pthread library on the router, which I found in the Kamikaze tree after compilation and copied over manually.&nbsp; The card works fine.</p><p>However, it&#039;s unclear that USB 2.0 works well enough on this device.&nbsp; It&#039;s also unclear if it&#039;s a SW or HW problem.&nbsp; I think that by default only USB 1.1 is enabled, which works well enough for my purposes, but turning relays on and off is not exactly a high-bandwidth application.</p><p>The ASUS costs $50 at NewEgg, including shipping.&nbsp; What we really need is a WRT54GL with a USB port.</p>									</div>

					<p>I got it today, USB audio works with no issues.&nbsp; Very straightforward install, just don&#039;t install anything other than kmod-usb-audio (this includes kmod-usb-core) and kmod-usb-ohci.&nbsp; Leave kmod-usb2 and kmod-usb-uhci out and there shouldn&#039;t be any issues.</p>									</div>
