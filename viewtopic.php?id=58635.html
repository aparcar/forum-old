					<p>Hey all, first time poster on these forums here.</p><p>I&#039;ve got this so-called Optical Network Terminal sitting next to me which seems to be CenturyLink&#039;s answer to home networking with fiber internet. Evidently this ONT (Calix 716GE-I) can withstand 4Gbps - clearly meant for a business complex or the like XD</p><p>Anyway I have a TP-Link TL-WR814N with OpenWRT firmware v14.07 installed, and my goal is to get it connected to C-Link via PPPoE. I have the correct user/pass (confirmed with C-Link) to log into the ISP, and thusfar I&#039;ve <a href="http://www.scottrmcclure.com/centurylink/">followed this guide</a> to no avail.</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>									</div>
