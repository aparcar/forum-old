					<p>Hi there, this is my first post and, while it is fresh in my mind, I wanted to tell people how I got an Eon Neoware 4000s Thin Client to work with OpenWRT.<br />These are a very cheap machine that you can buy on ebay (I got mine for Â£20 GBP (about $35 USD)). <br />I used a Compact Flash device to boot from because that obviously makes the whole thing silent as the 4000s is a fanless system based on the geode x86 CPU.<br />It is possible to use a normal IDE drive but it would have to remain outside the case and would make it very noisy.</p><p>Neoware 4000s are low power and very fast (I think mine is 600mhz&nbsp; but I cant remember) there is one onboard NIC and a PCI slot to add the second NIC</p><p><strong>Things you will need</strong><br />An IDE cable<br />A Compact Flash Card (mine is 128MB I suggest you use the same size or find out what the minimum requirements are for your version of OpenWRT)<br />A compact flash card reader with an IDE interface<br />A network card supported by the OpenWRT drivers<br />A monitor to attach the device to<br />A PS2 Keyboard (I dont know if USB keyboards work on it)<br />you will also need to purchase or make a power cable with a floppy drive connector at both ends for CF - (with a 4 pin molex at one end if you use a hard drive)</p><p><strong>Preparation</strong><br />Download a copy of openWRT to your main computer and&nbsp; write it to the CF card. Use the latest stable x86 version<br />Open the box and take out the Disk On Module drive that you will see plugged into the IDE slot <br />Now plug the compact flash reader into one end of the ide cable and plug the other end into the connector on the motherboard<br />I glued the CF reader to the inside of the case (careful not to make it short on the case or motherboard)<br />Next to the IDE connector on the motherboard, you will see a 4 pin power connector which you should use to power the disk or CF device<br />Now plug the NIC into the pci slot<br />put the case back together and setup the box with peripherals.</p><p><strong>First Boot</strong><br />On first boot enter the bios by holding down the delete key at POST<br />for some reason mine would only boot with the default settings but with the serial and parallel ports disabled<br />and with the boot device set to &quot;C Only&quot;</p><p><strong>If boot fails</strong><br />If OpenWRT fails to load when you first boot it&nbsp; play with the bios settings and see what works for you. <br />make sure that the CF device is configured as master drive<br />(A normal IDE drive would only work for me if I set the jumpers on the drive to &quot;cable select&quot;)</p><p><strong>When it works</strong><br />When I booted mine the LAN device was the NIC on the PCI slot and the WAN is the onboard NIC<br />I had to add a WAN port after I gained access via the web interface on 192.168.1.1<br />LAN was on eth0 and I selected eth1 to be the WAN<br />I set up the WAN to pick up an IP address off DHCP and rebooted and it worked</p><p>I hope this helps someone now or in the future<br />I can tell you these devices run OpenWRT with no problem and are much faster than other devices I have used<br />My biggest problem was getting the bios setup correctly but after messing with that for an hour or so i hit the right combination</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimmysaville</strong> on 22 Nov 2011, 20:03)</p>
