					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I just started using OpenWRT on a brand new TP-Link WR1043nd V2. I somehow managed to lock myself completly out of the box using my breathtaking iptables-knowledge. :-S</p><p>The failsafe-procedure (hold down the frontbutton while booting) is only valid for version 1. Version 2 is missing this hardware-button. I tried the same prodcedure with the available buttons, but no luck...</p><p>OpenWRT version is Barrier Breaker.</p><p>Has anyone a hint how to solve this problem without using the soldering-iron?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks so far, got the box into the failsave-mode. The system-led is now blinking really fast. Remaining problem is, that I do not get telnet-access. Also no response for ping on 192.168.1.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Dunno I don&#039;t think it is the same bug, but you could hook it up to a ttl-&gt; usb converter and poke around that way.<br />At least they have the same pinout and procedure for other tp-link devices. <br /><a href="http://galeria.tech-blog.pl/TP-Link_TL-WR1043ND_v2/TP-Link_TL-WR1043ND_v2_15.jpg.html">close up of the ttl header</a> (some soldering required).<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd#serial.console">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … al.console</a> (use the v8 description where applicable).<br /><a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=ttl+usb">Ebay search for some adapters</a> for an idea <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Make sure that the output of the adapter is 3.3v on the data pins and don&#039;t connect v+/vcc and you are good to go (if you have a ttl device you have 3.3v)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 29 Dec 2013, 03:11)</p>

					<p>Sometimes going to bed, having a sleep is the best solution. Don&#039;t know why, but starting up the box this morning (normal boot, no failsafe) gave me a telnet-console with factory settings on a lan-port.</p><p>It seems that hitting the reset-buttons several times does not enable failsafe-mode but directly resets the box.</p><p>Anyway... thank you guys!</p>									</div>

					<p>I think he just reset it before going to bed, the reset button works on openwrt (trunk) when it is pressed and hold down for a few secconds. (after openwrt is fully started).</p><p>Still curious though why he couldn&#039;t connect in failsafe.</p>									</div>

					<p>I played around with the device now several times to point out, whats the exact procedure to reset it. I think i messed several things up last week.</p><p>1. Hitting the reset-button very fast while booting the box, results in a fast-blinking status-led. Nothing more. Telnet access is not granted. Maybe this is a problem with the hardware-revision. As already written its v2, which is not yet supported by the stable-versions of openWRT. Box runs on BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge, r39161).</p><p>2. Holding the reset-button for at least 8 seconds (as it&#039;s written in the manufacturers docs) resets the device.</p>									</div>
