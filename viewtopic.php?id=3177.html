					<p>Since Linksys has moved to vxworks on 54G&#039;s, I&#039;ve been evaluating other routers, including the Motorola wr850g. I&#039;m using WhiteRussian RC3, which seems to run fine on the wr850g....But, the reset button behaviour is different from what I&#039;m accustomed to on the 54G&#039;s. This has been discussed briefly in other threads about bricked routers, etc., but, I don&#039;t see any explanations.</p><p>Basically, when the reset button gets pressed, the LAN LED&#039;s go orange and then back to all green (on button release), except for any ports that have active network connections attached. These ports stay orange. Also, any telnet/ssh sessions, etc., to the router &quot;lock up&quot; briefly during the button press and then return to normal. The gpio utility (gpio poll 5) shows the button press...But, what else is happening? ....Perhaps a switch chip reset or something?</p><p>Also, I haven&#039;t been able to enter failsafe mode using the reset button yet....I haven&#039;t needed it (fortunately!) except was just testing how it worked. </p><p>Thanks for any info,</p><p>David</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve managed to configure my WR850G to brick state and reset button does indeed do nothing.</p><p>Is it intentional or just the Motorola reset button does something else than Linksys one?</p>									</div>

					<p>From OpenWrt&#039;s Troubleshooting guide:</p><p><em>OpenWrt itself uses the reset button to enter into failsafe mode</em></p><p>So apparently there is a bug in WR850G implementation, cause nothing really happens.</p>									</div>
