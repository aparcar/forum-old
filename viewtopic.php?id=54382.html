					<p>Hi</p><p>I have TP Link WR2543ND Wifi Router.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd</a></p><p>I flashed the latest Open-WRT firmware.&nbsp; My hope was to add a torrent client to the router.&nbsp; Unfortunately 5Ghz wifi doesn&#039;t work running open-wrt.&nbsp; I tried various settings but I can only get 2.4Ghz to work.</p><p>I&#039;d like to flash back to stock.&nbsp; The instructions are:</p><p>1. Download the original firmware from the tp-link website <br />2. Cut the file: dd if=orig.bin of=tplink.bin skip=257 bs=512 <br />3. Write to flash: mtd -r write /tmp/tplink.bin firmware </p><p>I&#039;m not sure how to do 2+3.&nbsp; Can someone please give me some guidance.&nbsp; I am a complete noob when it comes to Linux.&nbsp; Can someone point me in the right direction?</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kiwijunglist</strong> on 4 Dec 2014, 07:15)</p>

					<p>SSH into your router, so you can run Linux commands on the router.&nbsp; You will need an &quot;SSH client&quot; for your PC, it is included with MacOS just open a Terminal and type ssh root@&lt;router IP address&gt;.&nbsp; On Windows you will need to install a third-party software.</p><p>You will then see a nify 1980&#039;s style text &quot;OpenWRT&quot; logo and a root command prompt.&nbsp; Issue these commands:</p><p>cd /tmp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&gt; this changes the directory so you are working in a RAMdisk, which can store large files, but only until the next reboot.<br />wget &lt;tp-link URL&gt;&nbsp; --&gt; this accesses the Internet and downloads the file direct to your router&#039;s RAMdisk.<br />ls -l&nbsp; --&gt; check the directory, you should see several small files and the one big one you just downloaded.<br />Step 2 -- Use the resulting file name instead of orig.bin in the dd command.&nbsp; if= stands for Input File.<br />You can ls -l again here and confirm you have made a somewhat smaller tplink.bin file.<br />Step 3 is the same.&nbsp; Writing the Flash may take a minute.&nbsp; Then the router will reboot, so no more SSH, you will then set it up like it came new from TP-Link.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 4 Dec 2014, 07:40)</p>

					<p>If you never set a password in OpenWRT use telnet (192.168.1.1 is the standard address).&nbsp; If you did set a password in OpenWRT then you use ssh.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>Ouch.&nbsp; I seem to of bricked the router.</strong></p><p>No errors during downloading/cutting/writing the firmware.<br />After writing the firmware, it automatically rebooted.<br />Upon reboot all the lights on the router are flashing.<br />The network connection works for 0.5 sec then goes off then goes on again, so I have no network access to the router.<br />After waiting 5 minutes I tried multiple resets and a power on -&gt; reset -&gt; power off -&gt; reset -&gt; power on cycle but it is still the same.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kiwijunglist</strong> on 4 Dec 2014, 08:10)</p>
