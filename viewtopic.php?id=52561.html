					<p>Hi All, I am trying to follow the steps listed under Part 1/2 Configure the Network on the Server from this link (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a>) but cannot get any of the UCI commands to be accepted when using putty?<br />i.e. below is an example of what happens when I enter one of the UCI commands suggested:</p><p>[root@test1 ~]# uci set network.vpn0=interface<br />-bash: uci: command not found</p><p>I have installed Openvpn on my Centos server so I am thinking that it may be because the UCI command is not used in the Centos, but am a novice so not sure? any help would be great.</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok its the command for the openwrt router! not the Server...&nbsp; they should prob make their guide a bit more clear as this is the heading these commands are under in the link (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a>) : </p><p>&quot;This is the configuration of the OpenVPN server only&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes I understand now.&nbsp; I am new to openwrt and linux in general and getting use to the terminology.&nbsp; Guides I have seen and attempted to use, switch between the terminology &#039;Server&#039; (meaning LINUX server) and call the router the &#039;Client&#039;. hence why I thought they wanted me to program those command in my Linux server when they referred to server.</p>									</div>
