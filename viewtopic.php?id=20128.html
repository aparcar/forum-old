					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve been using a rb433 with a ubiquiti SR71 wireless card since months and, slowly, after many reinstallations, I could get a working AP due to the improvements to the ath9k driver. I would like to buy another minipci card featuring classic ABG operation mode but I&#039;m experiencing doubts as I can&#039;t find any reference to any atheros chipset working under linux (openwrt) for this architecture. Can some of you share some success stories about some minipci brand working with AR71x boards under openwrt? I was about to buy a Mikrotik R52 but I could not find a exact reference about this card working with madwifi or ath5k.</p><p>by, simone</p>									</div>
