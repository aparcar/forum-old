					<p>Hi and first of all thank you for taking the time to help people with problems that aren&#039;t yours.<br />The reason that brings me here is probably extremely simple for you but none the less I do not know how to solve it.</p><p>My internet scheme is the following: I have a router delivering internet at home but then I have two ubiquiti loco m5 sending that signal to my shack(where I have my office and personal space away from the kids) where it&#039;s then connected to my airrouter&#039; which I now flashed openwrt(sqashfs) to see if I can make use of the usb port as a storage unit for my media centre. </p><p>I setup the router as a dumb ap routing everything to the router but I&#039;m having really low speeds in p2p. I think that if I disable the firewall and portforward the software I require to it will solve the problem. </p><p>How do I disable the firewall through luci?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>josedomingosteixeira</strong> on 29 Oct 2015, 14:22)</p>
