					<p>While configuring my router from a lan connection I made a small and unfortunate mistake.<br />I used ifdown in the lan interface... So the interface has been put down and I got disconnected.<br />Since I don&#039;t have any accessible wifi accesspoints to the router anymore either I&#039;m now pretty much stuck in failsafe mode.<br />I&#039;ve tried to locate the files that save the setting which interfaces should be enabled at boot but I couldn&#039;t find them.</p><p>So my question is, where&#039;s the file that stores the ifup/ifdown flag for the interfaces so I can once again access my router?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hello123456</strong> on 5 May 2014, 00:52)</p>

					<p>Uhm... ifdown simply shuts down the iface until the next boot or explicit ifup, so powercycling should&#039;ve been enough...</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve tried that, but powercycling for some reason didn&#039;t help. I was unable to reconnect to my router even after multiple reboots... Eventually I decided to go for a factory reset and upload a settings back-up. Still required me to re-do part of the configuration which I was trying to avoid but did it anyway.</p><p>@dabyd, thanks for you answer, now I know where to look next time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Anyways, the router is back up now and I used it to make a timelapse of sunrise using a webcam and MJPG-streamer <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
