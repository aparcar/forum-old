The firewall would be considered &#039;outside&#039;. The option of NAT could be done away with if each wireless client has a public IP address. Purchasing or renting a block of Public IP addresses would give you a small range to dole out to the wireless clients.</p><p>There may be some feature sets I&#039;m not aware of. I&#039;ll talk to a couple of firewall engineers and see what&#039;s possible.</p><p>You may consider keeping the router outside (turn off wireless), and Firewall behind the router. From there, connect a separate wireless access point to the firewall, inside interface, as well as a switch. This way you can control what&#039;s behind the firewall (I.E. wired and wireless clients).</p></blockquote></div><p>Here is what my setup looks like and how I got this to work. WiFi clients and the router is on 192.168.0.1/24 (lan) and the firewall is on 192.168.10.1/24. WAN on the route is 192.168.10.11/32. I got the firewall to see my client&#039; real IP by unchecking &#039;Masquerading&#039; for zone Lan and Wan (Network -&gt; Firewall -&gt; Zones). Also, for zone lan I had to enable forwarding to destination and source wan. This has to be configured the other way round too, i.e allow frowarding to zone wan from destination and source lan. Inspiration for this came from section &#039;Using routing&#039; documented on page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient</a></p>									</div>

					<p>First, as a new user, I wanted to say how much I appreciate all the discussion and work that&#039;s happening around this router.&nbsp; The posts in this thread, while sometimes difficult to navigate <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; are invaluable.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a little guidance on proper settings for transmit power for the 2.4 and 5 GHz radios on the WRT1900AC.&nbsp; In some Openwrt discussions/documentation, I get the impression that it may not matter, because the software may be setting it automatically based on regulatory domain.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not 100% sure I&#039;m understanding that correctly.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any suggestions/guidance.</p>									</div>
