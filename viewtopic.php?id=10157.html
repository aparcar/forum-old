					<p>OpenWrt White Russian 0.9<br />I tried to setup WDS, it works without encryprion but if i enable WPA (WPA2, AES) WDS no longer works.

					<p>I&#039;ve been having the same problem... did some reading up in the forum and the docs and here&#039;s what I&#039;ve learned (I haven&#039;t tested this yet and I am just learning, so this may be off base)</p><p>First, from the documentatinon here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration</a> ,</p><p>&quot;Note that it appears that <strong>there is a bug in nas that prevents WPA2 from working properly with WDS. It is known that WPA1 works.</strong></p><p>Remember that the non-free package NAS must be installed for WPA to work. It is also noted on the forum that <strong>you may be able to use WPA1 for the WDS link and WPA2 for client PCs</strong>; however, consider that the protection offered by WPA is only as good as the weakest link in the chain. Any data sent over the WDS link (including connections originating from client PCs connected to the satellite AP) will be vulnerable to an attack on WPA1. &quot;</p><p>Second, in order to tell openwrt that you want to use WPA1 over WDS, you need to set the nvram variables &quot;wl0_wds_*&quot;. From what I gather, you configure your wirless clients&#039; encryption settings in the wl0_* variables (not the wl0_wds*) variables. So you can still maintain wireless client encryption using AES/WPA2.</p><p>I imagine a running wl0_* configuration might look something like this<br />wl0_akm=psk2<br />wl0_infra=1<br />wl0_ifname=eth1<br />wl0_mode=ap<br />wl0_ssid=your_ssid_for_wireless_clients<br />wl0id=0x4320<br />wl0_closed=1<br />wl0_macmode=disabled<br />wl0gpio2=0<br />wl0gpio3=0<br />wl0_antdiv=-1<br />wl0_wpa_psk=your_psk_for_wireless_clients<br />wl0_wep=disabled<br />wl0_radio=1<br />wl0_maclist=<br />wl0_channel=4<br />wl0_crypto=aes</p><p>For the wireless WDS link:</p><p>wl0_wds=MAC address of other wireless router&#039;s wireless interface<br />wl0_wds_akm=psk<br />wl0_wds_ssid=your_ssid_for_the_wds_link&nbsp; * <br />wl0_wds_crypto=aes<br />wl0_wds_wpa_psk=psk_for_the_WDS_link&nbsp; &nbsp;*</p><p>* I don&#039;t know if these need to be unique to the WDS connection or if they can be shared between wireless clients/WDS.</p><p>Hope that helps some... again, I could be way off base since I didn&#039;t try it yet.</p><p>-Lraeski</p>									</div>
