					<p>Firstly, apologises if this is a stupid question but only recently joined the group, but is there anyway to find the .config used to build the pre-built versions of OpenWrt?</p><p>I have a TP-LINK AC1750 Archer C7 v2, and I have downloaded the pre-built version of Chaos Calmer 15.05. This works beautiful, but when I download my own compiled version of that software, my 5GHz disappears and nothing I seem to do brings it back to life. Since I know this works with the pre-built software, it must be a configuration problem in my build ... hence my need to find what the configuration of the pre-built version was, and I can then do a comparison...</p><p>Many thanks, for you time</p><p>RobF</p>									</div>

					<p>The device-specific configs used for releases are not available anywhere.<br />But the images have been compiled just with the default settings of the generic platform (like ar71xx) at the build moment. There are no exotic optimizations or settings. Practically the same thing as starting with an empty .config and then selecting just the platform (e.g. ar71xx).</p><p>Normally you also select the device, as there is no need to build images for all the possible devices.</p><p>But there have been updates to CC15.05 sources since the original release, and some of those changes may be the reason for your difficulties.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 11 Feb 2016, 14:11)</p>

					<p>Well, there is actually the output of ./scripts/diffconfig.sh in the 15.05 download directories for each platform.<br />E.g. ar71x: <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ar71xx/generic/config.diff">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ onfig.diff</a><br />But that just shows the plain contents: the selected platform + Luci + the release branding (+ build SDK &amp; IB etc.)</p>									</div>
