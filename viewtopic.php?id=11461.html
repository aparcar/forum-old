					<p>Had anyone managed to make the Logitech Communicate STX Webcam recently working ? I did not. I tried with the spca5xx and spca5xx_LE drivers but these could not detect my webcam. I verified it dmesg and the message showed the driver is not claimed by any device.</p><p>I tried with an older webcam, the logitech quickcam messenger and it worked perfectly but not with this new one.</p><p>Thanks for your helps.</p><p>Palexy91</p>									</div>
