					<p>Haha...depending on where exactly you are in Finland I guess there is nobody around who cares about your TX power for that matter. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Well you did post contents from your config file here, so you&#039;d just open that file with a text editor and start typing away. I personally use WinSCP or FileZilla depending on which machine I am on and log into the router, navigate to /etc/config/wireless (it&#039;s like any file manager), open it, change whatever I want in the text editor (currently I am where I pretend to be <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ) and then save it.</p><p>No promises though, adding platform to path was intended to be a workaround for strange behavior and missing values in LuCI and I thought it had been fixed anyway.</p><p>(Alternatively you can use PuTTY or command line and tools like vim, but the former is more intuitive if you&#039;re just starting.)</p>									</div>

The current firmware has no possibilities to turn that off so now AVM and Linksys are both routing and NATing and whatnot. I ordered a Zyxel modem that can be dumbed and will see what happens.</p></blockquote></div><p>I got carried away with details. Doing a very basic test (unhooking the WAN connection and rebooting the WRT1900) showed that the AVM router used as modem is not responsible for my issue as 198.168.1.1 still couldn&#039;t be pinged via WiFi and not accessed through the browser interface. In Luci the configuration interface WiFi is set to Access Point connecting LAN with WAN. The LAN interface bridges the switch eth0 with the wireless network (lan,wan). I wouldn&#039;t mind having access to LAN and WAN via WiFi without LAN connected to WAN. <br />Thanks for any ideas.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jimmy-jazz</strong> on 4 Feb 2017, 11:10)</p>

					<p>Ok so I did a reset to default settings, that was the only thing I didn&#039;t do and that sorted the problem. After the first reset I tried to change the channel of the 5 Ghz to a higher one (its now 36) and that made the radio to shut down. I could not wake it up what ever I changed so I did another reset and now everything works.</p><p>Thanks to everyone</p>									</div>

					<p>Just one more question. I have been using Putty to see the files of my router. I don&#039;t have the capacity to work with Putty so the idea of modifying the files with WinSCP or similar would be nice. But if I try to connect to my router with WinSCP or Filezilla I get error &quot;Received unexpected end-of-file from SFTP server&quot;. I can get connected with Putty. </p><p>So what am I doing wrong?</p>									</div>

Doing a very basic test (unhooking the WAN connection and rebooting the WRT1900) showed that the AVM router used as modem is not responsible for my issue as 198.168.1.1 still couldn&#039;t be pinged via WiFi and not accessed through the browser interface. In Luci the configuration interface WiFi is set to Access Point connecting LAN with WAN. The LAN interface bridges the switch eth0 with the wireless network (lan,wan). I wouldn&#039;t mind having access to LAN and WAN via WiFi without LAN connected to WAN. <br />Thanks for any ideas.</p></blockquote></div><p>LAN should normally bridge eth1 and WiFi. That sounds as if your config is a bit messed up. You can either change that or do a clean re-install.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can anyone please try and help me understand the interface changes in the newer builds?</p><p>First of all, eth0 (now LAN) and eth1 (now WAN) got switched around but after some research this seems to have been consistently applied across the WRT1X00 series. The switch config of course had to be changed as well. So, just a name change.</p><p>What is new: CPU (eth1) port is now VLAN tagged by default while WAN port isn&#039;t. As a result, it seems that the WAN interface had to be configured to bridge the tagged and the non-tagged port. This is admittedly creative, but I wonder why this was done? Also, WAN6 seems to be part of the bridge but actually now shows no physical settings at all. Won&#039;t this break functionality of WAN6 - has anyone been able to test this? Thanks!</p>									</div>

However going from r3063 to r3293, on the 3200ACM, I had to use the usb/ttl cable. As a test, I flashed r3063 using the usb/ttl (same build it was on), and then flashed with no issues to r3293. Unknown reason why I couldn&#039;t flash the first time, but after flashing again, it was fine. Seems to have been a one-off problem as no other users have reported issues.</p>									</div>
