					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am using the WRT54G v3.0 for the moment and each time I am using a P2P program, my connection becomes very low. </p><p>I would like to buy a new router and I was looking at the ASUS WL-500g Premium. </p><p>Is it a good HW for a stable internet connection, to connect a USB HD for HTTP and FTP server, for a ssh server?</p><p>That is pretty much all I need to do with this router.</p><p>What do you think? Any suggestion?</p><p>Many thanks for your help,</p><p>John.</p>									</div>

					<p>Many people seem to expect to load a 5,000 kilo cargo onto a VW beetle. It&#039;s simply not made for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you break the cargo down into smaller chunks at a time you can do it.</p><p>To expect a cheap $50 router, to hold up under heavy demands from an un-named P2P client running on a probably very expensive and fast PC, is not reasonable.&nbsp; &nbsp;With P2P software, the first place to look is choosing good software, and then configuring it to NOT open too many connections at once, and for it to NOT try and use 150% of your connection.&nbsp; &nbsp;I strictly limit my P2P app to a small number of connections and 50% of my bandwidth, the upload limit matters most.&nbsp; Reading the FAQ, forums, and documentation for your P2P software is a good place to find this information.&nbsp; Not this forum.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 7 Dec 2006, 06:27)</p>

					<p>Are you really sure it&#039;s HW&#039;s problem ?</p><p>For me, I run BitComet with unlimited upload speed, and everything is fine. You can seldom feel any lag when QoS is enabled. Even skype is running smoothly. By carefully setting maximum number of connection, or reduce the connection timeout, your router should last very long.</p><p>ASUS WL-500g Premium has a faster CPU and larger RAM, but have you verified your &quot;slow&quot; connection is due to full load of CPU, or exhaust of RAM ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Same with me; I have Azeureus running full-bore on two machines, and run a samba server for media, provide SSH and OpenVPN access.&nbsp; There&#039;s 22 torrents running on this machine (who knows about the other -- it&#039;s not my machine), and am able to browse the web fine as I write this.&nbsp; Also, I have 7 files being copied to the USB storage over samba.&nbsp; This is on my WL500GP box, though I was able to do this (sans the VPN) on my wl54gl as well.</p><p>The key was in both the QoS scripts, and setting several parameters in the proc sys net ipv4 stuff.&nbsp; For the QoS scripts I used rudy&#039;s qos-re.&nbsp; You have to adjust those to your environment.&nbsp; For the tweaking of some netfilter settings I added the following to my /etc/sysctl.conf:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>net.ipv4.ip_conntrack_max=2048<br />net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established=120<br />net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_udp_timeout_stream=120<br />net.ipv4.tcp_westwood=1</p></blockquote></div><p>This gave an immediate improvement in things like sporadically dropped connections/connection timeouts while doing heavy p2p.</p>									</div>
