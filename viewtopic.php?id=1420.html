					<p>The radius-authenticating WPA is called WPA-EAP. You can always use WPA-PSK, the type where you configure each client with a preconfigured key, just like configuring WEP.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is also possible to turn up your wrt54g into a radius server using openradius, gnuradius, xtradius or freeradius. All have been ported and seems to work on the wrt54g. The only problem is the user management that can only be done via a user file and not using an embedded sql database for instance.</p>									</div>
