					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying, in vain, to setup iptables to be able to filter traffic between LAN clients on my network; a setup I had working perfectly until recently when I decided to reflash and upgrade my WR814N (V9) and stupidly did not make a backup of my configs.</p><p>What I am looking to do it to control which devices on my LAN (wireless and wired) can talk to other devices on my LAN, so, for example, preventing LAN client A from talking to LAN client B, but being able to talk to LAN client C on a certain port only. <br />However, I can not get iptables to see any traffic that is being forwarded between the LAN clients.</p><p>To debug, I have a log rule in place that is set to log every packet going through all chains, but I can not see any traffic coming into the br-lan interface and then going out of the br-lan, and vica versa.</p><p>I&#039;ve enabled bridged firewalling in sysctl<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1</code></pre></div><p>My brctl show<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>bridge name    bridge id        STP enabled    interfaces
br-lan        7fff.d341f7838aa4    no        eth0
                                            wlan0</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;m not using the default firewall rules with OpenWrt, I&#039;ve written my iptables from scratch which I know previously worked.<br />Here&#039;s an example of some of the rules I&#039;m using:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-A FORWARD -i br-lan -o br-lan -s 192.168.1.100 -d 192.168.1.105 -j LOG --log-prefix &quot;LAN&gt;LAN Block: &quot;
-A FORWARD -i br-lan -o br-lan -s 192.168.1.100 -d 192.168.1.105 -j DROP
-A FORWARD -i br-lan -o br-lan -s 192.168.1.102 -d 192.168.1.103 -p 3306 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>Am I overlooking something here, or missing a package which should enable this?<br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jdg99</strong> on 18 Oct 2015, 22:35)</p>

					<p>To process the traffic between lan clients you must configure the switch ( swconfig ) in the way that the ports will not be part of the same vlan ( one diferent&nbsp; vlan per port ) and cpu port included in all vlans . This will force all traffic between lan ports to pass in/out of cpu and permit that rules can be made to allow/deny .</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you. VLANs are something that I have very little understanding of.<br />I hate to ask to be spoonfed, but could you tell me which part of the below is incorrect.<br />I don&#039;t remember having to touch switch config previously, IIRC, I just used the stock configuration that came with the image.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config switch
    option name &#039;switch0&#039;

					<p>Managed to band-aid this issue by reverting back to Barrier Breaker.<br />Seems to be a bug in Chaos Calmer that even with a weeks worth of tinkering I can&#039;t track down.</p><p>I tried an image-builder version of CC with the default settings and it was a no go, I&#039;m now using a image-builder version of BB, again with the default settings and with identical configs and it is working as it should.<br />If any one runs into this problem, please post as I&#039;d like to make a bug report.</p>									</div>
