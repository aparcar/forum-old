					<p>I successfully install OpenWrt earlier on my TL-WR841ND 7.2 by installing the factory to OpenWrt firmware from the trunk first and then the SysUpgrade firmware, also in the trunk. </p><p>My issue began when I tried to install the Gargoyle WebUI by installing the gargoyle_1.5.6-ar71xx-tl-wr841nd-v5-squashfs-factory.bin firmware from the Gargoyle site. To do that I followed the directions I found here: <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2032&amp;start=10#p10193">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi â€¦ =10#p10193</a> and after giving the &quot;mtd -r write /tmp/fw.bin firmware&quot; command I lost access to the router. It wrote the firmware reset and then I couldnt connect to it anymore. </p><p>I was however able to get into the failsafe by following the instruction in the wiki (pressing the QSS button after turning it on). I tried the instructions under the failsafe wiki aswell. I tried mount_root,firstboot and mtd -r erase rootfs_data. After issuing those commands and rebooting I still was not able to ssh or telnet to the router under normal conditions. I can only telnet under failsafe. </p><p>Under failsafe I also cant seem to connect the router to the internet. I tried using both wget and opkg to download a firmware but the router could not get a connection.</p><p>Is there a way for me to load a firmware on the router through the failsafe mode to revert to openwrt or even the stock firmware? I cant scp to the router and only my Windows 7 laptop seems to be able to connect to it under failsafe. Both my debian PC&#039;s cant connect.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok so I tried that and Ive gotten a few errors. Here is what I did:</p><p>First I put the router in failsafe mode again so I could access it. Then from windows I issued this command: nc -q0 192.168.1.1 1234 &lt; C:\firmware.bin<br />The firmware I wanted to put on the router being C:\firmware.bin</p><p>Then back on the router I connected via telnet and issued: nc -l -p 1234</p><p>In windows I got this error: nc.exe: invalid option -- q<br />Looking under the help it seems thats not even an option.</p><p>Under the router I get this error: Usage: nc [IPADDR PORT] Open a pipe to IP:port</p><p>Anything else I can try? Thanks for your help by the way.</p>									</div>

					<p>So no matter what Ive tried I cant seem to get netcat to work under windows. I also cant get any linux distros to connect to the router under normal mode and failsafe mode so im stuck using Windows.</p><p>Is there any way I could get the network connection working on the router in failsafe mode to download the firmware? Or is that not possible with failsafe mode?</p>									</div>
