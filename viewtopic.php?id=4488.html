					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m an engineer at Ximeta, Inc.<br />We decided to publish the NDAS driver for OpenWRT on our web site.<br />You can find the more detailed infomation at <a href="http://code.ximeta.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/OpenWRT">http://code.ximeta.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/OpenWRT</a></p><p>Download two ipkg files and install them.</p><p><a href="http://code.ximeta.com/download/1.0.0/125/openwrt/ndas-kernel_1.0.0-125_mipsel.ipk.bin">http://code.ximeta.com/download/1.0.0/1 … el.ipk.bin</a><br /><a href="http://code.ximeta.com/download/1.0.0/125/openwrt/ndas-admin_1.0.0-125_mipsel.ipk">http://code.ximeta.com/download/1.0.0/1 … mipsel.ipk</a> </p><p>With these packages, you can access the data or file system in the NDAS hardisk over network from OpenWRT.<br />that means you can use your OpenWRT device as like an NAS server.</p><p>You can attached up to 64 harddisks for 2.4.x kernel, up to 2,097,152 harddisks for 2.6.x kernel if the memory allows it.</p><p>And you can access the harddisk from your PCs in the same time without pluging/unpluging hassle.</p><p>Please post any question to <a href="http://www.ximeta.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=14">http://www.ximeta.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=14</a></p><p>Thank you<br />Gene Park.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jhpark</strong> on 21 Feb 2006, 20:15)</p>

					<p>As far as I know it doesn&#039;t work Kamikaze, you&#039;ll have to rebuild it yourself if you want it to work with Kamikaze.<br />Second, you&#039;ll need to either install ntfs-3g to read the HD or reformat the HD to something like vfat/ext2<br />Third you&#039;ll need to use the updated S60ndas file, because the one it comes distributed with is wrong.<br />Fourth, I have one of these and it works okay but the driver itself is kinda spotty (errors inserting/removing the modules, heavy memory use, etc) and there&#039;s very little you can do to fix it since Ximeta only releases blobs and not the actual source.</p><p>But short of doing some hardware hacking and adding usb support yourself to a wrt54g this I guess is the best alternate solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All,</p><p>IOCELL Networks released the ndas source code beginning this year, and I tried to compile this for the Fritz!Box.<br />This worked for the little-endian version (like used on 7170, 7270), but so far I could not get it compiled for the big-endian verstion (like 7390).</p><p>See here <a href="http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=149182&amp;page=10">http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread … mp;page=10</a> for more information.</p>									</div>
