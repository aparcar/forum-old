					<p>Searched around a bit without success on how to control LEDS on a WGT634U.</p><p>I see that a file called diag.c offers some control to LEDS but looking through<br />it, it appears not to support the WGT634U. And even at that it only offers to control<br />3 LEDS.</p><p>The WGT634U has 7, has anyone out there been able to control these either<br />through kernel or user space?</p><p>Appreciate any info.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Support for the wgt634u was recently added to diag; only two of the leds are under software control - power and wifi. The leds for the ethernet ports are directly wired to the switch hardware and cannot be controlled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your information.</p><p>I sync&#039;d up to the latest openwrt and built/ flashed.</p><p>Loaded the diag.ko and got:</p><p>&lt;4&gt;diag: Router model not detected.</p><p>Looking through the platform_detect() routine it appears that<br />perhaps the wgt634u is not detected properly?</p><p>Also, it looks like only the power LED is controllable, you mentioned the<br />WLAN LED, but I dont see that in the diag.c code.</p>									</div>
