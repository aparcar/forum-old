					<p>wow, this is very disappointing to say the least.</p><p>This router would be great if there was an advanced QOS built in. I&#039;ve heard VPN set up is coming via firmware updates from Linksys. So IMO advanced QOS settings would be all that is missing from the stock firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>I bought the product taking for granted that linksys would not be touting openWRT support if there wasn&#039;t in fact openWRT support. How wrong was I.&nbsp; Here are my initial thoughts on the router:</p><p>Pros: Best build quality of a consumer router I&#039;ve ever seen. Router sports a large passive heat sink with an active fan. The fan I presume only activates under load as it appears to be off during normal operation and the unit silent. The hardware specs are fantastic with a 1.2Ghz dual core arm CPU. The design itself is really a great reboot on the WRT54G classic. </p><p>Cons: Classic case of Linksys over promising and under delivering. There is no openWRT support or support for any other open-source firmware project despite the company touting this as a major feature over their cheaper AC1900 offering. The support rep also tells me that flashing openWRT will void your hardware warranty which makes little sense for a product that is &quot;designed&quot; to be used with open firmware. Linksys has a developer API that is closed to the public. Company&#039;s can develop apps (for their standard firmware) by applying through the linksys developer page. Right now there are only two apps (on the play store) available that allow you to control basic router functionality. This could have a been a great opportunity (albeit missed) to allow users to stick with the base firmware and augment functionality through downloadable apps made possible through an open API. The base firmware is incredibly basic and fails to take advantage of the hardware in any meaningful way. Lack of VPN support is my biggest gripe. Their base web UI keeps crashing despite being upgraded to the latest Linksys firmware. This locks you out both through their mobile phone app as well as through a direct Ethernet connection to the router requiring reboots. Buying this router right now is the equivalent to owning a Ferrari without wheels.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just 12 days ago a Belkin employee submitted the first patch.&nbsp; I&#039;m patient.&nbsp; If they&#039;re advertising OpenWRT support, I&#039;m believing it.&nbsp; I&#039;m pining for OpenWRT, if only ATM for the 6in4-henet tunnel driver.&nbsp; The stock firmware only does 6rd..&nbsp; So I&#039;m left pestering my ISP (yet again) for native v6.</p><p>OMG, when was IPv6 day, again?&nbsp; Has it been two years now?

					<p>Just a quick update. I was contacted by a representative from Belkin to say that the original support rep misspoke and that installing openWRT will not void your warranty. I asked him about why there is no image available despite support for openWRT being advertised, he cited the recent patch release and saying that support would be forthcoming. I noticed that as of today the model is listed as supported on the openWRT device support list albeit without referencing any supporting firmware. I asked the Belkin guy why their developers did not simply update the trunk themselves to support their product instead of leaving it to the community to support a feature they advertise. Needless to say he didn&#039;t really have an answer for me. </p><p>Has anyone tried to compile the trunk with their patch? Any updates on this?</p>									</div>

Love how company&#039;s up sell you on the open source support then release binary drivers. They obviously have no real interest in partnering with the open source community.

					<p>So, just to keep the discussion going. Linksys has posted an SDK as well as an initial build of OpenWRT. Keep in mind this is Linksys&#039; build, not the OpenWRT community&#039;s build, because it is dependent entirely on the Marvell driver which is currently closed source. Here is what Linksys has said and posted:</p><p>“Linksys has built the WRT1900AC with every intention of providing open source capabilities and making it the best solution available to the community.&nbsp; Linksys has provided OpenWrt with an initial code release that enables open source firmware development.&nbsp; OpenWrt has requested some patches to provide more open source functionality at the Wi-Fi driver level that requires cooperation from Marvell.&nbsp; Marvell is working on the usable driver and getting the required approvals through GPL. We are expecting this to be finalized and ready in the coming weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as this is complete;&nbsp; the driver will be released to OpenWrt.&nbsp; We will continue to collaborate with OpenWrt to ensure they have the necessary software as requested.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, an SDK based on Attitude Adjustment release of OpenWrt is posted here: <a href="https://github.com/wrt1900ac/opensource.">https://github.com/wrt1900ac/opensource.</a>&nbsp; This allows users to run OpenWrt firware on the WRT1900AC router.&nbsp; Our aim is to provide a robust and high performing hardware and software platform for the open community developers to customize their WRT1900AC the way that they see fit.&nbsp; We will continue to work with the open source community and our chipset partners to ensure the developers have the necessary tools to do so.”</p><p><a href="https://github.com/wrt1900ac/opensource">Access the SDK on GitHub here</a></p><p>That being in mind, I have tested the build they put up. I used it for a few days, there is a lot of functionality missing and I had some overheat issues that may possibly be related to the thermostatic fan not functioning in the test firmware. So I&#039;ve gone back to the stock for now until we can see some builds from the OpenWRT team itself.</p><p>As to the firmware they uploaded with the SDK: IPv6 works, the firewall rules stuff all works, but the diagnostics on the Wi-Fi stuff does not work yet. Gregers can comment on some of this, but as he explained to me, to make this really a fully functional firmware, they need to port the board support for the newest kernels, make them upstream merge-able, and given they have enough docs to add the missing features to make the whole board fully supported.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jperlow</strong> on 24 Apr 2014, 22:27)</p>
