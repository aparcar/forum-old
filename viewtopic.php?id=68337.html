					<p>Hi All,<br />I am new to OpenWrt and have recently installed it on BT Home Hub 5 with success over adsl on Sky.</p><p>I am now trying to make my router as a vpn server for accessing<br />1. Files on home network.<br />2. Using home network ip when I am abroad.<br />3. Using gmail from China when I travel there for work. This is restricted and rather than buying a vpn access - I thought I could use my setup for the same.</p><p>Can someone please help with the setup instructions for OpenVpn with Luci? I found OpenWrt SSH instructions but I feel more confident with Luci.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
