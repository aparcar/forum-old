					<p>My old TL-WR1043ND seems to have started causing packet loss and jitter, so I want to buy a new router, and I want it to be 802.11AC in order to keep up with the times. Archer C7 is within my budget and looks like it has all the features, but this thread is making me question that choice: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53703">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53703</a></p><p>I want an OpenWRT router because I need cron and wget. but if the new router causes packet loss too, the purchase would be meaningless. I saw some posts in the thread mentioned connection drops etc. That thread is not meant for such discussion so please share your feedback on OpenWRT performance of that router here.</p><p>Is the version of 802.11AC in that router Draft 7.0 comatible? </p><p>Is 802.11AC worth it or should I forget 802.11AC and get the old and reliable WDR4300? I have not bought any 802.11AC adapter yet. I have another option, that is keeping the stock FW of Archer and connecting my RasPi to run my commands until OpenWRT on Archer becomes mature enough.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sbcontt</strong> on 16 Mar 2016, 15:50)</p>

					<p>I haven&#039;t found a &quot;stock&quot; router firmware that is anywhere near as nice as OpenWRT. Plus they seem to all have undocumented backdoors.</p><p>The performance issues with the Archer as I understand it is attributable to the Ath10k driver, which is still fairly new, relatively speaking. So there is much hope that future refinement will address connection drops etc.</p><p>The bigger concern is the lockdown that TP-Link is adminstering. I have been unable to flash anything to TP-Link gear that was manufactured after Nov 2015. So I wouldn&#039;t buy anything from TP-Link that was manufactured in Dec 2015 or later.</p><p>WDR4300 has been discontinued. If you can still find it somewhere, this probably is you best option. If you do go Archer C7, return anything (before opening) that doesn&#039;t meet the manufacture date I mentioned.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Lou-ltef</strong> on 17 Mar 2016, 00:37)</p>

					<p>Wow. Now that is a lot of drama I was not aware of. I am glad that I did not purchase the C7 without asking here. Thanks for the responses.</p><p>Brand new WDR4300 are still available in local market here. Seems the better option between the two: <a href="http://www.snapdeal.com/product/tplink-n750-wireless-dual-band/1490759">http://www.snapdeal.com/product/tplink- … nd/1490759</a></p><p>But 76 USD feels like too high a price for such an old model.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sbcontt</strong> on 17 Mar 2016, 07:11)</p>
