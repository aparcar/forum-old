					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am spanish but I am in South Korea for 3 months and i plan to buy a WRT54GS or a WRTSL54GS. I visited yesterday some electronic shops here (Guang-ju, S. Korea) and the can provide me both. The shops&nbsp; only has the Korean version of these routers. So, its web interface is in Korean (with corean characters).</p><p>Can i change the firmware of the router to a international version?</p><p>Can i use the openwrt firmware with the Korean version of the router, or i need to have first the international firm in the router?</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Javier Sosa</p>									</div>
