					<p>hi,</p><p>i recently changed my router settings to see the ehternet ports as wan and unfortunately could connect anymore. i then started the router in failsafe mode (pressing any butten very often at start) and telneted into the system, only to do another big mistake. i copied the contents of /etc/config/ into a subfolder, (to my understanding now the system does not know about any hardware buttons i could press to get back into failsafe mode?) <br />after reboot the router did not change into failsafe mode anymore and normal boot did not change from orange light to green light anymore, but stays on orange light. attempts to connect with a static ip do not succeed either. i have however tried to flash a new firmware by starting the router in a different failsafe mode (pressing reset on start until power light flashes green), i succeeded to put it into failsafe mode 2 however the aftp put command works but after that the router doesnot reboot or do anything. i tried to telnet into the router when it is in this state but he wont accept connections. i dont have a serial connector, and i have no experience in such things although i know that it is possible with this router. <br />my questions are: is there any way to unbrick it without serial connection? if not, is there any way to unbrick it with serial connection? Can i reboot into failsafe mode 1 with serial connection, to revert my changes to /etc/config/ ?</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
