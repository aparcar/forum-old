					<p>Hi,<br />After many years my wrt54g v2 is dying. The switch sometimes locks up making the router non-responsive for a few seconds, and lately the router is resetting itself every now and then. This sucks because I also had some mods (sd card, serial port -&gt;microcontroller-&gt;temperature sensors) and lots of hacks in the software too, not to mention it&#039;s one of the rare units with 32mb ram instead of 16mb. I&#039;m running it with the case open and i&#039;ve put a heatsink on the switch, I think it&#039;s always been too hot, but the lockups are worse every day anyway. </p><p>Anyway, I think the only solution is to buy a new router, and I could use some of your help for that,<br /> what do you suggest taking into account these constraints?<br />- Serial port accesible<br />- at least 32mb ram<br />- a decent cpu (&gt;=200mhz)<br />- preferably, a chipset that doesn&#039;t turn the router into a toaster (most routers are always too hot and eventually break).<br />- Accesible GPIO lines for SD card mod<br />- USB would be nice to have but not at all necessary<br />- Wireless is NOT necessary<br />- an ethernet switch is necessary (so no single-port devices, i want to use it as a router)<br />- cheaper=better</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>naplam</strong> on 8 Jun 2010, 14:31)</p>

					<p>Now the flash memory has died or something. mtdblock 4 is apparently empty when mounted, it&#039;s not pivoted to / and i get just the squashfs... i think i&#039;ll just flash the newest openwrt version and see what happens.</p>									</div>

					<p>Does it need to have a case? If not, the Ubiquiti Routerstation Pro is pretty interesting (680Mhz CPU, 128 MB ram, SD card reader and 7 GPIO lines). It&#039;s even shipped from the factory with OpenWrt installed (an old Kamikaze snapshot, but runs well with trunk).</p>									</div>

					<p>it looks good, it could be an option although a bit overkill. i could do with a dlink dir-320 maybe. in the meantime, i&#039;ve flashed the latest openwrt version to my wrt ( i had a very old version from 2005 or so), and got the sd card working. But it&#039;s gone nuts tonight again..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>naplam</strong> on 11 Jun 2010, 13:04)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t want to lose my nvram, i have stuff i want there like the tweaks for 32mb ram, the nvram is ok anyway. I&#039;m going to keep the router running today, see if it locks up again. I&#039;ve even put a pc motherboard heatsink on the adm6996 switch so it doesn&#039;t get so hot (and i&#039;ve removed the case too). I don&#039;t know what to think really, at first i thought the switch was the problem but when the flash started causing trouble... it looks like the router is falling apart! i&#039;ve also set the cpu to run at 192 Mhz instead of 200</p>									</div>
