					<p>I installed Backfire 10.03 on my wrt54gl, then configured it as wireless client. I did the error of clearing the ip address of the lan interface and now I&#039;m not able to access it anymore. I saw it got an ip address from my router on the wireless interface, but it is not pingable on that address.<br />How can I recover?<br />I tried the failsafe procedure which says: &quot;...Immediately after the power cicle, rapidly click a button on the router for 60 seconds (it may be any button)...&quot;. I used the reset&nbsp; button since it is the only one available. But then I&#039;m not able to reach it at 192.168.1.1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you guys but I wasn&#039;t able to ping 192.168.1.1 with no one of the &quot;soft&quot; methods.<br />Finally I succeded with the hard method as outlined here under &quot;Revival tip #2&quot;: <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/wrt54grevival/wrt54grevial.htm.html">http://www.freewebs.com/wrt54grevival/w â€¦ l.htm.html</a></p>									</div>
