					<p>Hello,</p><p>In the AR7Port WIKI says: &quot;Support for WAG354G is integrated, still needs testing...&quot;. Well I&#039;d like to help with that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I&#039;m a proficient programmer (C, C++, and others) <br />I&#039;m familiar with GNU/Linux development enviroment.<br />I don&#039;t have experience in kernel dev though</p><p>Before starting I&#039;d like to have a copy of the original firmware (to be able to switch between the two until openwrt is more stable and PPPoA works) which is not yet available at Linksys&#039; website. It seems that there are only two ways of obtaining it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1) compile from source, which needs proprietary tools from MontaVista<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2) build a serial cable and download it from the router</p><p>Am I right? anybody has managed to obtain the original firmware for the -EU version?</p><p>Francesc</p>									</div>

This is NOT a requirement, simply a damned good idea; if anything goes wrong you can just TFTP the old firmware back.</p></blockquote></div><p>But from your post now I think that&#039;s not the case. What a shame. I&#039;ve also seen the following remark on White Russian RC3 announcement: </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If you use tftp or anything else, you will brick your router</p></blockquote></div><p>which seems to agree with your remarks and contradict the first quote. Well, I&#039;ll get a serial cable then. I&#039;ll borrow one from wotk that I use for developing firmware for an ATA (Analog Telephone Adapter, to ethernet) which has a serial connector that looks like the one in my router. I hope is the same <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I haven&#039;t used a JTAG before though, but for the looks of it (after a quick googleing) is not cheap, so I&#039;ll have to stick with serial.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>joseangel wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>On my ADSL2MUE I used the dd command from the shell of the official firmware to get exact copies of all mtd partitions so I could fix my mistakes easily.

I&#039;d have thought something more complicated was required and wasted time looking for it!</p><p>cesc</p>									</div>
