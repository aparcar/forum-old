I am using KUbuntu 6.10 with recent updates as the build system. I tried to google for the docs, but did not found anything relevant. Thanks.</p>									</div>

After some searching I found that there was no include and lib map in staging_dir_mipsel/usr (there were two files include and lib; which was obviously wrong). The content of include was libcgi.h so it looks like the copy instruction did go wrong.

					<p>Just to followup, I rebuilt for the 2.4 kernel and it seems to function identically to the image I downloaded.
