					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I am not very good at iptables, so maybe someone can help.&nbsp; I would like to have the system forward any requests to its WAN IP address coming from within the lan to the appropriate server.&nbsp; Example:</p><p>server1 has ip 192.168.100.9<br />Public IP is 66.66.66.66 (example)</p><p>server1 hosts an apache server hosting &quot;somedomainname.com&quot;</p><p>If I use a workstation (ip 192.168.100.20) to go to <a href="http://somedomainname.com">http://somedomainname.com</a>, which resolves to my public ip, I get a &quot;Cant establish connection to server....&quot;</p><p>Is there any way to trick the router into redirecting traffic going from the LAN to its public ip, making it look like its coming from the outside and not internally?</p><p>I know its possible, but just dont know what the appropriate ip tables rule should look like.</p><br /><p>Any help is appreciated.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
