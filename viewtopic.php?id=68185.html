					<p>Hello!</p><p>Trying to flash a belkin router with the openwrt brcm47xx profile and it fails to boot. I&#039;m new to all this and would appreciate some advice.</p><p>I am connected through serial on the router and can use ethernet to upload files via tftpd.</p><p>Here is a paste of the boot log: pastebin.com/Fq2xPSgB. It covers the cfe boot, cfe flash to custom image and attempt to boot the custom image. It also covers return to Manufacturer&#039;s firmware and normal boot.(Pretty sure it has information of the RAM and flash size).</p><p>It seems the problem is some kind of &quot;magic&quot; that doesn&#039;t match up. Can I modify the magic myself? lol throw my magician hat on?</p><p>I have no idea what to do - but I&#039;m willing to try around and understand.</p><p>Cheers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Modifying the trx magic is not the only modification to be done, since you are using an unsupported device. You&#039;ll need to install an linux os if you haven&#039;t yet or use a virtual machine for windows to run an linux os. There a few openwrt wiki documents to go through before starting development on your device. If your interested i&#039;ll supply you some links. Currently i&#039;m doing my own for my little Belkin also the F7D4302 basically the same firmware &quot; F7D4302-8302_WW_1.00.28.bin file. I am in the stages of nearly completing the firmware for my mine, but the magic value is incorrect for both Assume magic 20091006 and Current magic 30524448. You&#039;ll understand more if you go through the whole process of development and research in orded to correct mistakes. I have to place the correct values in for mine and compile run tests for stablity setup gpios, usb ports, the wireless seem to work fine. If all goes well then I feel that there really shouldn&#039;t be a patch but maybe remove that &quot;30524448&quot; so a person can place the trx magic value in or correct the values based on some successful builds.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey - thanks for answering!<br />My main os is Kali Linux. I have a degree in computer science and I&#039;m sure I could use my knowledge and learn from you if you&#039;re willing to help.<br />I&#039;m a bit unfamiliar with lower level tinkering like this but as I said I&#039;m willing to try.</p><p>I don&#039;t even know where to look for the Magic value... I can start a hex editor and look at the bin&#039;s files but since I don&#039;t know what i&#039;m looking for that&#039;s pretty much in vain.</p><p>Which references would you recommend exactly to start developing for my router? Cheers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your thoughts on the hex is correct as to i have found out myself now putting in the correct value, compiling without errors, figuring out the proper uploading process which have worked is the miniserver or atftp testing but having the correct value does really help. My image that i done so far has that problem with it and maybe after today should be worked out my last image had that problem still and an mtd issue on the loader part. Here is an an example output of the mtd. You notice the erasesize that maybe the magic value? Have rebuild and reconfigure some parameters and test.</p><p>root@OpenWrt:/* cat /proc/mtd<br />dev:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;size&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;erasersize&nbsp; name<br />mtd0: 00030000&nbsp; 00010000&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;boot&quot;<br />mtd1: 007c0000&nbsp; 00010000&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;firmware&quot;<br />mtd2: 000008f0&nbsp; &nbsp;000008f0&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;loader&quot;<br />mtd3: 001132f4&nbsp; &nbsp;00010000&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;linux&quot;<br />mtd4: 006ac400&nbsp; 00010000&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;rootfs&quot;<br />mtd5: 00430000&nbsp; 00010000&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;rootfs_data&quot;<br />mtd6: 00010000&nbsp; 00010000&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;nvram&quot;</p><p>I&#039;m not a developer and just started doing this as a hobby and for knowledgeable purposes but have been using linux for a few years.
