					<p>Hi,</p><p>TLDR: I have 2 routers in my network, one from my internet services and one openwrt device. The problem I am facing is that if the openwrt one is turned on, I have quite some trouble with DNS resolving.</p><p>The setup:<br />Telephone comes in, into the standard router I got from my internet provider.<br />A long network cable is connected to that, it goes to the top of my house into a openwrt router.<br />The openwrt router has clients connected by cable and by wifi. The SSID of the openwrt router and the main one are different.</p><p>Exact problem: When the openwrt router is turned on like this, I sometimes have very bad dns resolving. It doesn&#039;t matter on which router I am connected. It looks like it gets worse once a machine is connected once to the openwrt router, but it stays bad once it connects back to the main one. Linux and Android seem to do better than Windows.<br />I also have a third router which is also running openwrt. When I connect this one to the network, using internet becomes almost impossible sometimes.</p><p>Note: When I go on VPN with my pc all problems seem to be solved. But I don&#039;t want to be on vpn all the thime <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Is openwrt doing something weird in my network with dns? </p><p>Thanks!</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p># cat /etc/openwrt_release <br />DISTRIB_ID=&#039;OpenWrt&#039;<br />DISTRIB_RELEASE=&#039;15.05-rc1&#039;<br />DISTRIB_REVISION=&#039;r45695&#039;<br />DISTRIB_CODENAME=&#039;chaos_calmer&#039;<br />DISTRIB_TARGET=&#039;brcm63xx/generic&#039;<br />DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=&#039;OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05-rc1&#039;<br />DISTRIB_TAINTS=&#039;&#039;</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Veda</strong> on 7 Nov 2016, 18:01)</p>

					<p>Have you switched off dhcp on the Openwrt box? It&#039;s probably serving up dhcp to clients and pointing them at itself as the dns server</p>									</div>
