					<p>Hi</p><p>I need help with this. I have been trying to solve it for&nbsp; hours now.<br />I have created 2 wifi SSIDs &quot;guest&quot; (wlan0-1) which is for guests which interface is PUBLIC and the other is &quot;mynetwork&quot; (wlan0) for admin purpose which interface is LAN. I then created zones PUBLIC and LAN for firewall policies. The gateway for this network is on separate physical device with IP address 192.168.1.10.</p><p>My goal is to prevent hosts on zone PUBLIC accessing zon LAN except if it really is necessary.</p><p>Here are the interfaces:</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option force_link &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ip6assign &#039;60&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0.1 wlan0 wlan1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;true&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;192.168.1.10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.1&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;public&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;10.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;wlan0-1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;true&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;208.67.222.222 208.67.222.220&#039;</p><p>Please excuse my lack of understanding of how networking works, but I see that I need to enable forwarding between zone PUBLIC and LAN to enable hosts connected to wifi &quot;guest&quot; to access the Internet so I have enabled 2 way forwarding between zone LAN and PUBLIC.

In your firewall config, you first have a default policy for PUBLIC that prohibits all forwarded traffic. You then have an explicit, but unnecessary rule that also prohibits forwarding. You then have two rules, which allow forwarding of traffic to/from PUBLIC and LAN.</p><p>And this last pair of rules is now what allows ping to reach a wired host in LAN from a Wi-fi guest in PUBLIC. It is the last pair in your firewall config which applies to forwarding, and because it is the last, it remains the effective one.</p><p>If you want to only allow Wi-fi guests to reach the Internet, but not other hosts in the LAN zone, then what you must do is a unidirectional forwarding rule that matches only when a specific destination is being used. The following rule accomplishes that:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
   option name &#039;Gateway access for PUBLIC&#039;
   option src &#039;public&#039;
   option dest &#039;lan&#039;
   option dest_ip &#039;192.168.1.10&#039;
   option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>This rule replaces the three forwarding-related rules you currently have. </p><p>In order for return traffic to work, you will need to enable connection tracking on the LAN zone. To do this, change your LAN zone config to the following:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
    option name &#039;lan&#039;
    option network &#039;lan&#039;
    option input &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option output &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option conntrack &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, I have also removed the &quot;forward&quot; option since it is not necessary. The gateway device resides in the same subnet as your LAN, and the logical network &quot;LAN&quot; is bridging together adapters &#039;eth0.1&#039; and probably the admin-side wireless network. Hence, traffic is automatically allowed to flow freely, and no forward is necessary.</p><p>With these changes, clients in PUBLIC should now be able to ping the gateway device at 192.168.1.10. The gateway device can respond to the ping and the packet is allowed back (due to conntrack), but if the gateway tries to ping the clients in PUBLIC, that traffic is blocked. Similarly, traffic from LAN towards PUBLIC is blocked. Clients in PUBLIC also cannot ping clients in LAN (other than the gateway device, that is).</p><p>In order for all other traffic to work from PUBLIC (i.e. web browsing etc.) you will need to either set the gateway address (192.168.1.10) explicitly for all clients in PUBLIC, or you will need to configure and expose a DHCP service in the PUBLIC network. You have not shown the content of your /etc/config/dhcp file, so I cannot say if the service is available or not. </p><p>If the service is available, then you will need the following additional rule in order for clients in PUBLIC to be able to use it:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
    option name &#039;DHCP for PUBLIC&#039;
    option src &#039;public&#039;
    option src_port &#039;67-68&#039;
    option dest_port &#039;67-68&#039;
    option proto &#039;udp&#039;
    option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The return direction is working automatically, because the OUTPUT direction in PUBLIC is allowed by the zone&#039;s policy.</p><p>Note that the router will not answer to DNS requests from the clients in PUBLIC. To allow this as well, add one last rule:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
    option name &#039;DNS for PUBLIC&#039;
    option src &#039;public&#039;
    option dest_port &#039;53&#039;
    option proto &#039;tcp udp&#039;
    option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>For a step by step guide on creating a guest WLAN that enforces the information what you&#039;ve just read above, you can check this link: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan</a>. Note that unlike our setup here, the setup in the link assumes that the wide area access is on a separate logical network. This is not the case for us, since the gateway device is at 192.168.1.10.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think the firewall rules know how to deal with CIDR-notation i.e. &#039;192.168.1.10/24&#039;. If you want to use a range of individual IPs or block out entire networks, then you&#039;ll need to resort to adding an <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#ip_sets">IP Set</a>. I have not used IP Sets in my firewall rules, so I can&#039;t give any good examples.</p><p>The latest configuration you posted seems correct to me, so the problem could be somewhere else. Perhaps it is a routing table issue? Using the first configuration, type &#039;route -n&#039; on an SSH shell and post the result here.</p><p>You should also verify the settings on your wireless clients. Join a wireless client into the &quot;public&quot; network, and ensure it gets configured correctly. If you use DHCP on the wireless client, ensure it gets a good IP address and has the correct gateway setting. The DNS settings on the client might still be incorrect unless you&#039;ve fixed them in /etc/config/dhcp. If you use static addressing on the wireless clients, then ensure the settings are correct.</p>									</div>

					<p>A thought occurred to me: perhaps we need to be a bit more explicit on the routing configuration. Modify your Public network in the /etc/config/network to match this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;public&#039;
    option proto &#039;static&#039;
    option ipaddr &#039;10.0.0.1&#039;
    option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
    option dns &#039;208.67.222.222 208.67.222.220&#039;

config route &#039;Default route for Public&#039;
    option interface &#039;public&#039;
    option target &#039;0.0.0.0&#039;
    option netmask &#039;0.0.0.0&#039;
    option gateway &#039;192.168.1.10&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Remember to retain the &#039;lan&#039; network so it has the &#039;conntrack&#039; option, and the explicit firewall forwarding rule that I wrote earlier.</p><p>Does this change help? Post the &#039;route -n&#039; command from the OpenWRT router after this change.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We are modifying the default routing table, so there is a chance that after this change, you&#039;ll lose Internet access from the LAN behind the OpenWRT router. If that happens, just remove the default route and restart.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>zorrox wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Since my gateway resides on the lan network, is it possible to have a wan network which only gateway 192.168.1.10 resides but the rest is on the lan network? Which interface should I assign to this wan network?</p></blockquote></div><p>You could either use two /28 segments (192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.15 and 192.168.1.16 - 192.168.1.31), or you could use 192.168.1.0/24 as the network where the gateway resides, and use 192.168.2.0/24 for the &quot;LAN&quot; behind the OpenWRT.</p><p>It would require you to configure the switch device, and assign VLAN tagging for the ports. Configuring the switch is always a bit tricky, because the configuration needs to be complete, and may cause changes not only to network, firewall and DHCP, but also to Dropbear and uhttpd because the network interfaces change around. The pitfall is that if you make a mistake anywhere in the process, you might end up having to reset your router completely from safe mode or over a TTL serial cable because it becomes inaccessible due to some obscure mistake that you didn&#039;t account for. I&#039;ve been there, and done that. Configuring OpenWRT through a serial cable is NOT fun <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>zorrox wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The reason I have the gateway in lan network because I thought it could reduce delay introduced by routing since there is one more router to connect to the Internet through my home ADSL. So I thought if this gateway is not on the same lan network, the routing delay may be higher. Is that a correct assumption?</p></blockquote></div><p>This is the correct assumption. Splitting the LAN network to LAN and WAN would introduce one additional routing decision for the &quot;LAN&quot; network behind the OpenWRT router. In your current setup, no such decision is necessary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 21 Aug 2017, 22:58)</p>

					<p>Although I cannot be sure of this, I tend to think that these intermittent disconnections might be caused by the inherent complexity of your current configuration.</p><p>The UCI system is capable of creating pretty amazing firewall configurations based on the instructions it is given, but it is by no means complete or fail-safe. This fact bit me in the ankle when I had the need to create time-based limitations for the Internet-connected devices that our kids use. I had to resort to the &#039;firewall.user&#039; script file and non-UCI custom chains, all because the UCI system adds some default entries high up in the iptables filter table that cannot be effectively overridden in UCI config alone. And it does this even without you necessarily knowing it!</p><p>I think you should use &#039;iptables -t filter --list&#039;, &#039;iptables -t nat --list&#039; and &#039;iptables -t mangle --list&#039; in order to get a complete, full overview of all the intertwined rules that the current configuration establishes. Perhaps by analyzing these rules in detail we can get a better view on what is truly going on, and possibly pinpoint the failure.</p><p>For example, my innocent-looking UCI config:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWRT:~# cat /etc/config/firewall

					<p>Thank you for your explanation of the complexity of the firewall. It is always good to learn something new.<br />I do not really have the skills and knowledge to use the commands you suggested so I need to study further on how to use them. <br />For your information, the disconnection is not intermittent, so far all TCP connections from &quot;lan&quot; to &quot;public&quot; will always drop after about 20 seconds. I have even removed the deny rule below to allow full access from &quot;public&quot; to &quot;lan&quot; but the same issue persists. I am now looking for a way to view other logs on the device. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule

					<p>That sounds really strange. I can&#039;t really think of any reason why the iptables would drop the connection at the 20 seconds mark. Just a thought, but perhaps there&#039;s some sort of an auto-timeout at the SSH server?</p><p>Can you elaborate a little bit on the network topology? Is the SSH server, and the printer, directly connected to the OpenWRT router? Is the SSH server on a computer of its own, or is it hosted on the OpenWRT and just listens on the &quot;public&quot; network&#039;s interfaces? How is the printer shared to the network, is there a daemon running on OpenWRT, or does the printer have its own DHCP client and a printer daemon?</p>									</div>

					<p>My answers are below:</p><p>- Does the device running the pfSense firewall terminate the DSL link, or do you have a separate DSL modem?<br />Yes, terminated at pfsense</p><p>- Apparently your ISP exposes their Internet service through VID 100 and an IPTV service through VID 600. Correct?</p><p>My ISP Internet service is on VLAN 500 but this only configured on pfsense. VLAN 100 is only configured on openwrt. The openwrt has trunk connection to pfsense. The truth is I am also not really good with VLAN, I am still can not figure out why VLAN 100 configured on openwrt works while Internet connection on pfsense is on VLAN 500. You may able to figure this out. <br />VLAN 600 is configured on openwrt and pfsense for IPTV. The LAN interface and WAN interface on pfsense are configured with VLAN 600 and bridged on pfsense to enable IPTV. I think this is on layer 2 all the way to my ISP network.&nbsp; </p><p>- What is the purpose of VID 1? Is it required to reach the management interface of the pfSense firewall?</p><p>Not really. It was there based on other users configuration in my country which I stumbled on the Internet who subscribed to the same service. I do not remove it as I do not know how it can affect my network.</p><br /><p>- How do you want to use the OpenDNS DNS service? Only for your OWRT router, or for all wired and wireless clients as well?</p><p>I use OpenDNS for HTTPS web filtering to complement pfsense HTTP filtering. It is actually configured on openwrt only but all clients get DNS IP which is the openwrt interface IP. All clients DNS requests are relayed to OpenDNS by Openwrt.</p><p>I also observe that there is no drop connection between clients on 10.0.0.x. using the same SSH server and printer. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
