					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a brand new TL-WR710N(EU), v2.1.</p><p>When I try to change the stock firmware to CC, I get:</p><p>Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>As stated in the TOH/wiki, I use the v1 firmware file &quot;openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr710n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin&quot;, since there is no dedicated v2.1 firmware file and v2.1 models are said to have the identical hardware of the v1 models (in contrast to v2.0).</p><p>What I tried:<br />-Use different browsers: never works<br />-Rename the file: never works<br />-flash DD-WRT which has a dedicated v2.1 version: success. This works as expected.</p><br /><p>So, what to do? Is the information in the wiki wrong? I also can&#039;t try a DD snapshot, because the snapshots currently don&#039;t exist.</p><p>Is there a workaround?</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance,<br />chesse</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chesse</strong> on 7 Mar 2016, 23:49)</p>

					<p>Oh my god! You&#039;re incredible.</p><p>I can confirm that the procedure described in the posted link allows to flash a TL-WR710N(EU), v2.1 to Chaos Calmer 15.05, using a TL-WR710N, v1 image.</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>									</div>
