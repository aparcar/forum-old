Editing /etc/resolv.conf is the incorrect way to do it. The way it works is dnsmasq (which is a small lightweight DNS server) that runs on the router. So you set your resolv.conf to go through the local DNS server. The file /tmp/resolv.conf.auto is used by dnsmasq and that is where you put your ISP DNS servers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry I didn&#039;t have a lot of time to post before. Looking over your original request I may have misunderstood your overall goal. Yes, that command will replace what is in resolv.conf which is the point of what I suggested. This will cause your openwrt to point to your main AP&#039;s DNS server to resolve names/IPs. /etc/resolv.conf is just a symbolic link by default to /tmp/resolv.conf which gets created every time you reboot. That&#039;s why I said if pointing to your existing DNS server does what you want you can make it permanent by removing the symbolic link and puting the actual file in /etc. There are cases were I set it up that way rather than having a DNS server running on every AP on the local network. Sorry if I am misunderstanding what you are trying to accomplish, maybe a few more details on the big picture?</p>									</div>

If you add that dns option like KillaB suggested (you can even add that dns option in the web interface) it would be listed in your /tmp/resolv.conf.auto when you reboot and cause your local DNS server (on 127.0.0.1) to forward DNS requests to your other DNS server if it can&#039;t resolve the host/ip itself.</p>									</div>
