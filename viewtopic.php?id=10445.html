					<p>Is it possible to have ASUS WL-500g Deluxe configured to behave as a true switch - to have some connected directly to WAN and be able to send DHCP requests to WAN from them, with their physical MAC address ? My idea is to have 2 ports behaving default way (&quot;NAT&quot;), and 2 ports behaving like they were on the switch/hub connected directly to WAN cable.</p><p>I was trying to add another interface &quot;switch&quot; and vlan2, like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># vlan0ports=&quot;1 2 3 4 5*&quot;
vlan0ports=&quot;1 2 5*&quot;
vlan2ports=&quot;3 4 0*&quot;
vlan2hwname=et0
switch_ifname=vlan2
switch_device=vlan2
switch_proto=none
# (the rest is left as default)</code></pre></div><p>but it does not work as I expected. I am unable to ifup switch, also there are problems connecting to 1, 2 ports.<br />However, is the configuration correct at least theoretically ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been doing a lot of playing around with the switch lately. Not sure exactly what the setup is on a Deluxe (I&#039;ve got one but haven&#039;t checked the switch settings), but if it&#039;s anything like the Premium your setup will work, you simply need to make sure that you include port 5 in each of your VLANs since this is the port that actually connects into the CPU of the router; if you don&#039;t include port 5 the router never gets to see the traffic (it only gets switched on the ports of the switch itself rather than into the router).</p><p>You probably need to do some bridge setting up as well. Take a look at this post:<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9632">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9632</a></p><p>And of course the NetworkInterfaces page explains the whole port 5 thing:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/NetworkInterfaces">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/NetworkInterfaces</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Okay sorry my misunderstanding; so you end up with 3 ports (WAN plus two others) as just a switch (invisible to router), and 2 ports as actually connected to the router right? If that&#039;s the case then there is no way/need to &quot;ifup&quot; the interface since it doesn&#039;t actually exist on the router itself logically... the switch is a separate device and operates independantly, so once you set it up there&#039;s no need to try and configure IP settings/etc for it, it should just work... that is in theory at least.</p><p>I found in my own applications that the easiest thing to do was place each port on it&#039;s own VLAN, and then just group together which ever ones I wanted into logical bridges (IP addys/etc are assigned per bridge). This also seemed to be necessary to make Spanning tree work properly, so added bonus!</p><p>i.e.<br />Set all 5 ports to their own VLANs</p><p>vlan0hwname=&quot;et0&quot;<br />vlan0ports=&quot;0 5*&quot;</p><p>vlan1hwname=&quot;et0&quot;<br />vlan1ports=&quot;1 5*&quot;</p><p>vlan2hwname=&quot;et0&quot;<br />vlan2ports=&quot;2 5*&quot;</p><p>vlan3hwname=&quot;et0&quot;<br />vlan3ports=&quot;3 5*&quot;</p><p>vlan4hwname=&quot;et0&quot;<br />vlan4ports=&quot;4 5*&quot;</p><p># And create two bridges.. this is the LAN, I include WIFI in mine which is eth2<br />lan_ifnames=&quot;vlan3 vlan4 eth2&quot;<br />lan_ifname=&quot;br0&quot;</p><p># and here&#039;s your WAN bridge<br />wan_ifnames=&quot;vlan0 vlan1 vlan2&quot;<br />wan_ifname=&quot;br1&quot;</p><p>Of course you don&#039;t have to use wan_ for your second bridge, I just use it out of convinience. If you do stick with it, don&#039;t forget to clear out the rest of the wan_ settings (i.e. ipaddr, etc).</p><p>It seems a bit complicated, but like I said it makes spanning tree work properly and it makes it very easy to move ports around as you desire in the future.</p>									</div>

					<p>Works nice, it&#039;s a nice solution. Thanks.<br />On my wl-500gd &quot;eth2&quot; needs to be replaced with &quot;eth1&quot;; someone may even happen with this router, that LAN1 port, is port 4, LAN2 is port 3, <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=10450">etc..</a></p><p>I still wonder if there&#039;s a way how to ignore port 5 for the wan ports..</p>									</div>

					<p>actually, the jolouis&#039; solution seems to behave not exactly as I expected - the router itself is unable to reach WAN (so I cannou easily install packages ftom internet) but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s not my mistake somewhere..</p>									</div>
