					<p>Very interesting to me as well. Looking to do something similar to the Dash Button but with OpenWrt on an A5-V11 or something for home automation.</p><p>Here is some info that might help to boot speed optimizations:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/preinit_mount">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/preinit_mount</a></p><p>It seems several people around the net have gotten their (non openwrt) embeded linux booting in under a second by doing to some extreme lengths to compile the kernel all together or something.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JesseGordon</strong> on 15 Jul 2016, 20:55)</p>
