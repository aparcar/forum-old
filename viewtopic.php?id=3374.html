					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;m thinking about installing openwrt on my Asus WL500g. <br />Then I would like to connect to internet using an UMTS connection. I&#039;ve been googling around for some time, but I couldn&#039;t find any doc about making an umts connection using openwrt. I believe it&#039;s possible, since I can do it on my linux box, but I&#039;d like to be sure before switching completely.<br />Has anyone got success in doing such connection? Do you know any doc around?</p><p>Thanks<br />Maxxer</p>									</div>
