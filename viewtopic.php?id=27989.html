					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m having some issues with building php5 from the svn source at the moment. However, since the rest of the image is working and I can install php5 manually once the image is on my router, I would like to include the php5 package which is available in the package repository on openwrt.org in my image together with my compiled sources.</p><p>Is there anyway to do it?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not entirely sure about this, but it can&#039;t hurt to give it a try:</p><p>Copy the php5 package (ipk) from the package repository into your build packages directory.&nbsp; I think this is somewhere around target/image directory (I&#039;m not at my Linux box right now)???&nbsp; Then rebuild the image with &quot;make target/install&quot;.</p>									</div>
