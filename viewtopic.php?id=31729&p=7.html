					<div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>the default is now with static IP 192.168.0.1/24 on the ethernet port</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, for example I use 192.168.0.0/24 as my primary home network (LAN), with 192.168.0.1 being my main desktop. So your choice ensures the absolutely maximum possible amount of hassle each time I need to reset this router to defaults. Which e.g. happened just now, as I tried to move the ethernet port to the LAN zone, and something went wrong.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>the wr703n device is not a regular router with ethernet port for wan and other for lan..</p></blockquote></div><p>I notice that you work to attain a triple-WAN configuration with auto-fallbacks. While very useful in some cases, arguably that&#039;s not something EVERYONE will use. As for what I mean by regular layout, is I want to use Wired+Wireless as one segment, no wired WAN, and only a single 3G WAN.<br/>With OpenWRT I more or less know what is where and how it&#039;s set up by default, but while starting from your Triple-WAN mode, I will have to dig through literally every corner of the web interface, ensuring there&#039;s nothing left over from your setup, especially not anything that could compromise the security because of making no sense in what I am reconfiguring the router to.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>romanrm</strong> on 16 Nov 2011, 22:56)</p>

					<p>So far I&#039;m seeing that my Huawei E1550 seems to lose connection and go into a weird lock-up mode, not answering to the router AT commands, sometimes with the blue LED on the modem flashing constantly. The only way to bring it back to the working state is to unplug and replug the modem (or reboot the router).<br/>The above behavior seems to not occur (or is a lot less frequent) if the modem is connected via an unpowered USB 1.1 hub (that I randomly had lying around).<br/>Can anyone confirm the modem locking up problem? This doesn&#039;t seem to be a power issue, as my router is plugged into the power supply, not USB.</p>									</div>
