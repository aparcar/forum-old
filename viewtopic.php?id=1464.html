					<p>Hello,</p><p>I flashed the firmware of my WRT54GS v. 1.1 with the newest snapshot from wbx (cause of HFSC, see <a href="http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1454)">http://openwrt.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1454)</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t reach the router after flashing, also not in failsafe mode. Later on I found out that boot_wait was off, strange cause I had it on. Shortening the pins helped with this problem, now I was able to reach the router on 192.168.1.1</p><p>After this I set boot_wait on that I can at least flash other firmwares. Then I tried several firmwares, the latest experimental and the original linksys (to flash from linksys back to openwrt). The original linksys works but no openwrt one. It simply doesn&#039;t boot and only after shortening the pins I am able to get into the failsafe mode.</p><p>What can I do ?<br />Do I have to change some settings in failsafe mode to get it running in normal mode ? I erased the nvram to get the default values back but this didn&#039;t help, too.</p>									</div>

					<p>UPDATE:</p><p>If I flash the router with the exp release from 28 Mar, it boots without problems. But any later release (23 Apr or latest CVS snapshots) don&#039;t boot. However, before all the flashing and revover procedures I had the 28 Mar release installed so after all I am where I started.....</p><p>I assume that there are nvram settings that confuse the later releases. Was something changed concerning nvram settings in the later releases ? Do I have to take care of a special update procedure before flashing a newer firmware ?<br />Did somebody else encounter this problem or a similiar one ?</p><p>Sometimes I feel like a magnet for strange problems <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>RenÃ©</p>									</div>
