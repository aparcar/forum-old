Hmm, the only real thing that comes to mind is that possibly theres a ip routing conflict.

The Dual-WAN Agent backs out cleanly now, meaning it&#039;ll restore everything to the way it was before it was started. Bringing back both default routes, flushing the ip rules and flushing the wan2 routing table.</p><p>C. The reason for the complex grep/kill system is I cannot seem to killall a shell script, but I changed what grep is looking for so that it won&#039;t kill your vi session, only the script as it&#039;s running.</p><p>Thanks again Pierre,<br />-Craig</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>SouthPawn</strong> on 1 Feb 2010, 02:44)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the update Craig.</p><p>I still don&#039;t have a definition for the GW2MARK chain in the Firewall status page, and traffic is still going through the wrong WAN. It&#039;s unfortunate that BusyBox&#039;s shell does not honor the -x parameter to make debugging easier. Is there another way I could generate an execution log for you?</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Is it useful to create three separate firewall rules for TCP, UDP and ICMP when the DualWAN rule is set to All, rather than one firewall rule that does not specify a protocol?</p><p>The iptables cosmetic error in the log is still there with 0.1d.
