					<p>Hi, I&#039;m a pretty new user but I&#039;ve been searching for info on this for two days with no luck.</p><p>I&#039;m using an Asus WL-500gP and trying to access the samba share I&#039;ve setup. I&#039;ve followed both the USBHowTo and SAMBAHowTo tutorials in the Wiki; USB is working, my external HDD is recognized and auto-mounted to /mnt/disc0_1 and I successfully installed and setup SAMBA. Well, perhaps not so successfully. The samba server is running I can see it appears in my Network but I&#039;m completely unable to access it. I&#039;m using Windows Vista Home Premium when trying to access it and <a href="http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/3122/sambaerrordk6.jpg">I get this error.</a></p><p>Heres the contents of my smb.conf:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>workgroup = LOL 
server string = OpenWRT Samba Server 
wins support = no 
dns proxy = no 
name resolve order = lmhosts hosts bcast 
log file = /opt/var/log/samba/log.%m

syslog = 0

guest ok = yes
