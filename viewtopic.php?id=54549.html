					<p>PPTP is generally considered a compromised technology, so if you can use OpenVPN then you probably should. Although not native, OpenVPN is supported across many platforms, so whatever OS you&#039;re using on your laptop, it is likely to work.</p><p>It took me a long time to finally get my head around OpenVPN on OpenWRT. If you&#039;re not completely comfortable with the set-up process and you&#039;re not using any of OpenWRT specific feature, you might want to take a look at the Gargoyle project, which is build on OpenWRT but has a stronger focus on the GUI. In particular it includes menu options for setting up an OpenVPN server.</p><p>If you&#039;d like to stick with OpenVPN on OpenWRT then take your time to read and watch as many tutorials from the last couple of years as possible to get an understanding of what is involved.</p><p>In particular, the user authentication system relies on keys and certificates which you&#039;ll need to create (using EasyRSA) and then distribute (this essentially means having certain files on your OpenWRT router and certain files on your laptop).</p><p>Go through everything step-by-step and keep a close eye on the System Log - OpenVPN is very good at reporting problems with it&#039;s configuration - If you spot an error, Google it and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find your answer.</p><p>One thing to note, is that any OpenVPN config options that you store in /etc/config/openvpn are in UCI format, so if you&#039;re looking around other sites, you can&#039;t simply copy &amp; paste parameters - you&#039;d need to specifiy these are UCI settings.</p><p>I found it easier to use native OpenVPN configuration options. If you&#039;d like to do this too, then you can do so my using two files:</p><p>/etc/openvpn/myserver.ovpn<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tls-server
server 10.0.8.0 255.255.255.0
dev tun1
port 1194
verb 7
keepalive 10 60
persist-tun
persist-key
ca /etc/openvpn/CertificateAuthority.ca #This file will also be needed on the client
cert /etc/openvpn/ServerCertificate.cert #This file will also be needed on the client
key /etc/openvpn/ServerKey.key #This file is private and should be kept safe
dh /etc/openvpn/dh-parameters-4096.dh #This file is private and should be kept safe
tls-auth /etc/openvpn/ServerAuth.ta 0 #This file will also be needed on the client, but you&#039;ll need to specify a &#039;1&#039; instead of &#039;0&#039; on the client
comp-lzo yes</code></pre></div><p>/etc/config/openvpn<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config openvpn myCustomConfig
    option enable 1
    option config /etc/openvpn/myserver.ovpn</code></pre></div><p>Hopefully this will get you started. There is still much more to do, but it&#039;s a worthwhile exercise. Once you&#039;re finished you&#039;ll have total control of how you configure routing etc.</p><p>You&#039;ll also probably learn about how you can either direct all of your laptop traffic via your home VPN, or just the traffic that need to in order to access one of your home network IP addresses.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>
