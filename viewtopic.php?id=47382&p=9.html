The issue can be seen even in the latest version r41212.

It does not trigger failsafe mode.<br />You can make a hotplug script indeed, however I used the default factory reset package in the buildroot. You may have to look up how the reset button is named specifically for your router, and change the config file for the factory reset package to match your button name.</p><br /><p>@ philip_petev</p><p>I&#039;ll look into relay support for that router!<br />When the bug is solved I will make a new build.</p>									</div>
