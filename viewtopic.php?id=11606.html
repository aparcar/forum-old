					<p>Hi,<br />Running WhiteRussian RC6.<br />I have recently changed my setup and can&#039;t get port forwarding to work the way it used to.<br />My main XP box used to be plugged directly into the openwrt router and port forwarding worked fine.<br />Now I have introduced a FreeBSD NAS server in the way. It has 2 NICs. The 100Mbit/s is plugged into the OpenWRT<br />router and the gigabit goes to the XP box. It&#039;s all just to get gigabit access to my NAS without a gigabit switch:</p><p>ADSL modem<br />&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; | (fast ethernet)<br />&nbsp; |<br />OpenWRT router<br />&nbsp; | 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; | (fast ethernet)<br />&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; | 192.168.1.2<br />FreeBSD NAS server<br />&nbsp; | 192.168.0.1<br />&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; | (gigabit)<br />&nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; | 192.168.0.2<br />XP box</p><p>Adding a static route on OpenWRT to 192.168.0/24 via 192.168.1.2 gets traffic passing through the FreeBSD server<br />and back to the XP box.<br />However, port fowarding doesn&#039;t work the way it used to.<br />When the XP box was directly connected to the router and had IP 192.168.1.127, I used the following<br />in /etc/config/firewall:</p><p>forward:dport=59287:192.168.1.127</p><p>Now I thought the following would work, but it doesn&#039;t:</p><p>forward:dport=59287:192.168.0.2</p><p>I guess this is something to do with the XP box not being directly connected to the router,<br />but I&#039;m not really up on linux.<br />Anyone know why this forwarding doesn&#039;t work?<br />Many thanks from a FreeBSD admin.</p>									</div>

					<p>You are having two NAT stages, so you should forward from OpenWrt to 192.168.1.2, and from freebsd to the final destination.</p><p>However, as I see it, you only need one NAT. Just make the FreeBSD box bridge it&#039;s two interfaces together, and it will be as if you had a three-port switch with OpenWrt box, FreeBSD box and XP box all connected to it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry I wasn&#039;t clear.<br />The FreeBSD box is not performing NAT, it is simply acting as a router.<br />Those 192.168.0/24 IPs are hardwired.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gildenman</strong> on 12 Jul 2007, 13:06)</p>

Just ports that were previously forwarded fine now are not<br />and the obvious config change didn&#039;t fix it.<br />Thought this might be some limitation I didn&#039;t understand. I just wanted to make sure that<br />the port forwarding I&#039;ve configured should work.<br />If so, then, as you say, I guess I&#039;ll have to iron this out with tcpdump on FreeBSD.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, I think it should work, though it is a bit complex design (requiring specifying multiple routes on the XP box, if I understand correctly). Tcpdump time it is.</p>									</div>
