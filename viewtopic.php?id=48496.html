					<p>I have an idea for a device. I want to program it to use within openwrt. I would like for the user to push a button, then it initiates my code, and it utilizes the wireless. It seems the most popular boards are the wr703n and the Alfa hornet-ub. I believe the Alfa hornet-ub has a button that I can assign things to. I also believe I can reassign the reset button on the wr703n. I&#039;m just curious if anyone is a different board or set up to accomplish this. I am also considering pairing the arduino with it to delegate the processing of my code to the arduino. What do you guys recommend for a simple one button initiation of code?</p>									</div>
