					<p>I run two VPN servers on OpenWRT, one is a private VPN for myself [tun0, subnet 10.0.0.0], while the other is a NAS VPN [tun1, subnet 10.1.1.0] for a group of users to access a specific share on my NAS server and nothing else. As one would expect, there are extremely different firewall rules for both interfaces, with tun1 restricted from all LAN access, except to port 445 for the NAS Server IP.&nbsp; </p><p>Now, here&#039;s my problem... too often I log in to the WRT&#039;s web management page to see tun0&#039;s subnet become tun1&#039;s and tun1&#039;s subnet become tun0&#039;s... which means my private VPN access privileges have now been granted to the extremely restricted NAS users (as most of my firewall rules for the VPNs are interface applicable, while the NAS vpn is also restricted with numerous subnet rules).&nbsp; </p><p>Stopping/Starting OpenVPN (<em>/etc/init.d/openvpn start/stop</em>) doesn&#039;t work, however restarting OpenVPN does (<em>/etc/init.d/openvpn restart</em>).&nbsp; While that solves it when I become aware of it, it doesn&#039;t when I&#039;m not aware this issue has occurred.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this or would know where I should start looking to narrow down what&#039;s causing this?&nbsp; (It almost always occurs, when it does occur, after a router reboot)</p>									</div>
