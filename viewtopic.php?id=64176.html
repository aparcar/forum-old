					<p>Dear forum.</p><p>Having my router close to my children, I&#039;d like to minimize the radiation - better safe than sorry, right? I was considering to buy a JRS-router (<a href="https://www.electrohealth.nl/73-low-radiation-wifi-accesspoints-jrs-eco-wifi">https://www.electrohealth.nl/73-low-rad … s-eco-wifi</a>), but as a programmer/Maker, and engineer - I&#039;m sceptical to the JRS, and really appealed by OpenWRT.</p><p>My question is simple. Do I need to buy a JRS, or can I configure eg. WRT1200AC or the C7 to be even better at minimizing radiation?</p><p>Thanks in advance guys!<br />L.</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt lets you configure the output power for the wireless hardware, provided that your device supports that option.</p><p>I had a quick look to the page you linked. The routers shown there look surprisingly similar to those from ASUS, and the configuration pages from the manual (<a href="https://www.electrohealth.nl/images/produkten/English_Manual_JRS_Eco-WiFi_alg_V9.pdf">https://www.electrohealth.nl/images/pro … alg_V9.pdf</a>) look surprisingly similar to those from OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for all your replies!<br />@eduperez, thanks for your feedback. I suppose you can also change the DTIM (beacon interval) to reduse radiation in &quot;standby-mode&quot;?<br />@nortii, in case you are serious, I would like to have more control over my adjustments. And my experience shows that tinfil dont hold the radiation barrier I&#039;m looking for.<br />@tmo26, please let me decide how serious I am, and aim to be, in this matter. For the record, I want to reduce radiation to as low as conveniently possible. To emphasis my point, I will not hold any of my children trapped in a Faradays cage throughout their life.</p>									</div>

					<p>There is some merit to his concerns, in fact I heard about a case where a man sued his neighbor or something like that because he had headaches and after investigation it was none other the wifi!</p><p>One has to wonder.. microwave OVENS operate in the 2.4Ghz, at much higher power mind you.

					<p>I heard a lot of this kind of news like wifi causes cancer or something. but that all bs for me. never happen to me neither any of my neighbors since if I scan for wifi access point now, this will make your phone flooded with AP list you can connect to.</p><p>and even the scientist nor the specialist can claim it either, most of the tests ive read so far was done by gradeschool students that knows nothing about radio waves and such.</p>									</div>

					<p>@merc6.9 Yes 2.4GHz is a high and therefore potent frequency (yes, low frequencies similar to your heart rates are also potent). But as energy is a factor of frequency(1/wavelength) times transmit power, the alternative 5GHz-area is not a perticular good alternative frequency area.</p><p>@remlei As far as I might respect your opinion, the issue deserve an objective view. Yes, some scientists have yet to discover the danger of wifi radiation at this energy level. But I sugguest you go out and buy a good book about black swans. Even though you have yet to discover them - does not state the fact that they do not exist. Let me throw you a burning stick: Why do you think WHO (Woorld Health Organization) recommend that you do NOT place your router in you bedroom?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lopstad</strong> on 14 Apr 2016, 16:18)</p>

					<p>oh I see then, you might as well put youre entire bedroom shielded with thick lead anyway if youre really concern anything on radio wave radiation since beleive it or not, your favorte TV station and your mobile carrier outputs more radio waves than your poor wifi is.</p><p>or live somewhere in mountains, that might be the best bet you can do,</p><p>my main point here is, radio waves is everywhere... litreally everywhere. you like it or not, its eveywhere. even in outer space it exist only though it happens in act of nature.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 14 Apr 2016, 16:29)</p>

					<p>@ramlei, you&#039;re partially right. But the fact that radio waves are everywhere, isn&#039;t an excuse to welcome even more. Please keep your micro-wave-oven-door closed, even with your liberal mindset. Please also keep in mind that field strength reduce exponentially by distance, which means that those radio towers far, far away are not as dangerous that they seem. By all means - unless you have them next door! But lets not assume that any of us live in Tjernobyl, Fukushima, next to air-running power lines or inside a radio tower.</p>									</div>

Ok, but after years full of studies we can at least assume it&#039;s somehow safe. Anything else is just FUD.</p>									</div>

					<p>@nortii Yes, we have natural radiation eg. from the sun. As for fear, uncertainty and doubt goes (yes, I had to look it up) I agree that nothing here are straight facts - whats why I follow the principle of safe rather than sorry. And I see its a hot subjects as the response has been overwhelming (though slight of topic). But you are entitled to be skeptical - in fact I encourage you to be skeptical. As I am regarding your statement of me continuously transmitting 60 watts of electromagnetic radiation. Looking forward to google that tomorrow!</p>									</div>

					<p>@lopstad:<br />all wifi routers has all these options for 4 times cheaper price. Also you must be really afraid of sun ( because you really can feel radiation of electromagnetic waves&nbsp; and get effects ex. sun burns). WiFi signals cant penetrate your skin because they reflects from you ( all objects are reflective with has bigger rough that wave length, 2,4ghz&lt;-&gt;~12cm), also @nortii has explained about power differences.</p>									</div>
