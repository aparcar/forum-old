					<p>Simple story here... looking for some help.</p><p>Background -<br />Had a router running DD-WRT but wanted more. Killed it trying to get that &quot;more&quot; out of it. Shopped around for a day and picked the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-600dhp">Buffalo WZR-600DHP</a> specifically for its RAM/CPU specs and especially for its ability to run OpenWRT. Based on what I was reading it seemed that I could order it online and not have any problems with getting an incompatible hardware version.</p><p>Goals -<br />**Guest Wifi - I want to be able to run a guest wifi without worrying about my visitors. I want to exclude them from my network. I&#039;ve also already had an issue with torrenting. Got 1/6 marks on my internet account...<br />If possible I&#039;d also like to allow my Airport Express to be visible from the guest network for Airplay, but that&#039;s low on the list of priorities.<br />**OpenVPN - Want to route the guests to the VPN, but I also want to route a few particular websites through it, such as YouTube (buffering issues), for all machines on my network. Needs a &quot;kill switch&quot; to block internet access for intended clients/websites/services/etc if the VPN connection should die.<br />**CIFS Client - I have some SAMBA folders I&#039;d like access to.<br />**TransmissionD - For the occasional grab. I&#039;d like to route this through VPN as well. I don&#039;t trust Comcast for anything.</p><p>Progress - <br />The router is a C0B2 which I loaded the prescribed &#039;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-ag300h-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&#039; AA image onto. I believe I somehow wound up putting rc1 on it (only realizing that in past few minutes). I&#039;ll talk about each experience so far...</p><p>###AA:rc1 -----------<br />---Guest Wifi - Works when I set it up as another interface just like my other two, but when I try to set up a separate subnet the clients can&#039;t get an IP. Tried tutorials from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=40760">here</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan">here</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/guest-wlan-webinterface">here</a><br />---OpenVPN - Was not able to get a tun device established.<br />+++CIFS Client - I was able to get CIFS working, but that was about it.<br />/\/\TransmissionD - Didn&#039;t bother yet.</p><p>###BB:trunk (24Apr2013) -----------<br />---Guest Wifi - Same as with AA.<br />===OpenVPN - Was able to get connected. Failed at trying a few different scripts regarding &quot;kill switches&quot; based on routing rules and iptable mods. Think part of the problem here is just not knowing enough about routing and such (yet) to be able to troubleshoot this problem.<br />---CIFS Client - No longer able to get CIFS working. Utilize cifsmount and kmod-fs-cifs, same as with AA.<br />/\/\TransmissionD - Didn&#039;t bother yet.</p><p>???Questions???<br />1) Where is the 600DHP at with development regarding the BB trunk? Are there many issues? I tried to discover a good way to observe them but have not been able to find anything. Guessing I&#039;m just looking in the wrong place.<br />2) Should BB be stable enough for me to get away with running all that I&#039;m trying to?<br />3) Do you think it&#039;s worth going back to AA and trying again? I say this in reference to the fact that my only experience with AA is under RC1.<br />4) Any other words of wisdom you have to offer? I&#039;m up for learning something new.</p><br /><p>!!!Configs!!!<br />Let me know if you think it&#039;d be helpful for you to see them. I will post as soon as I get home this evening. Seems I crashed something while trying to restart &#039;network&#039;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Status update... I ditched BB and went to AA... non-rc/beta version.</p><p>Having good results so far.<br />Guest wifi is working with the exception of the VPN. Haven&#039;t had too much time to tinker and get it working yet.<br />VPN successfully connects even though I haven&#039;t sorted out routing yet.<br />CIFS Client works like it did before on AA-rc1.<br />Hoping to try out Transmission when I have time.</p>									</div>
