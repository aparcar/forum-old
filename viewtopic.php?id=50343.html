					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am building a Alix2 image with AA and would like to know how to include my own custom scripts in the init.d directory so that it would run on boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;The script here is using calls to setup iptables and tc (so I am not building any custom packages).&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>Why I need this?&nbsp; Well I want to create a standard build so that I can replicate to quite a number of units to be distributed to branch offices.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks for helping.</p>									</div>

					<p>To my knowledge init.d scripts are not run at startup time unless you eed add a symlink to /etc/rc.s: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/process.boot#init">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/process.boot#init</a><br />executes the symlinks to the actual startup scripts located in /etc/rc.d/S##xxxxxx with option &quot;start&quot;</p><br /><p>Alternative might be to write the commands in to /etc/rc.local , which is executed at the end of the boot process.<br />That is the preferred place for user commands.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/notuci.config?l#etcrc.local">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/notuc … tcrc.local</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 14:47)</p>

					<p>I think your mean is almost like <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages#packaging.a.service">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packa … .a.service</a> .<br />If you need a standard build, there should be some extra in the Makefile, but I don&#039;t know what should be added in.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I tried the following and it works.&nbsp; Place the script that you want to run in &lt;build root&gt;/files/etc/init.d directory and make it executable (chmod 755).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Build the image. One the first boot the system will create the symlink and enable the script but you have to make sure that the script is make executable when it is place in the directory before the build.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>									</div>

So, put the enable command there to enable your init script in the final image. E. g.:</p><p>files/etc/uci-defaults/myscript:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

exit 0</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod 0755 files/etc/uci-defaults/myscript</code></pre></div><p>Should work!</p>									</div>

You can also change the hostname by using Luci. Go to Luci --&gt; System --&gt; System and change the value in the Hostname field. Using an init.d script to make this change is the WRONG way to go about doing it.</p><p>Secondly, your script should implement a start(), stop() and restart() method. NOT a boot() method.</p><p>Thirdly, you are recursively calling your own script in the first line. You enable an init.d script ONCE from the command line by invoking it with the command /etc/init.d/scriptname enable. You do not embed this call within the script itself.</p><p>Fourthly, you cannot start your script with a 00 number. The system script is executed with priority 10. This script sets the hostname. If you try to execute your init.d script before the system script, then the system script will undo your changes. Your script needs to be numbered AFTER the system script. So START should have a value &gt; 10....</p><p>Really - I suggest taking a little more time to read the answers you&#039;re given on this forum and also browse through the openwrt wiki. It has a lot of information that is very helpful.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dl12345</strong> on 16 Nov 2016, 22:33)</p>
