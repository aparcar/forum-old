					<p>(I asked about this on the general forum but that was probably the wrong place and I was a bit vague in that post.)</p><p>I wish to&nbsp; backport the wlcompat module from the trunk (kamikaze) to RC5 and RC6. The version in the trunk has the new hardware entropy collection tweaked so it doesn&#039;t&nbsp; adversely impact system performance.</p><p>I see that Felix (ndb) has generated this:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/packages/kmod-wlcompat_2.4.30-brcm-4_mipsel.ipk">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd â€¦ mipsel.ipk</a></p><p>Does the above .ipk have the latest entropy tweak? Is it binary compatible with both RC5 and RC6? </p><p>While I&#039;m at it, is there a source repository for the files at ndb/whiterussian/packages?&nbsp; May I ask how they were built, i.e. which&nbsp; SDK?</p><p>Thanks very much,<br />Bill</p>									</div>
