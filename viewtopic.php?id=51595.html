					<p>Which revision/build are you using? </p><p>The only LED on by default for this (and many other routers) is the power LED. The rest can be configured with Luci (system menu-&gt;LED configuraiton). </p><p>I have no problem with the 5 GHz radio here, so double check your settings or reset to default. It&#039;s possible you were unlucky and caught a bad nightly build also, so you could try upgrading to a newer one. You&#039;ll have to reinstall Luci and any other packages after upgrading.</p><p>You can try the images you linked, although I don&#039;t see any reason for them as the fixes he was working on have now been incorporated into the regular trunk builds.</p>									</div>

					<p>No issues with 5GHz signal strength. Did you verify that yours works properly on stock firmware? Could be faulty hardware.

Most of the OpenWrt binaries for the routers come at least with Wifi, WAN and LAN LEDs pre-configured. The WD N750 doesn&#039;t have LAN LEDs on the front, but I don&#039;t know why the other two were omitted. (Edit: It just occurred to me that this may be because the actual LED for the WAN interface is on the back, too, and rather than have the Wifi LED for the wrong Wifi interface it is left unassigned.)</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I am not a Linux developer.&nbsp; So, it is a bit s steep to learn how to config the LED lights for the router.</p></blockquote></div><p>Oh, you don&#039;t have to be a Linux developer for that.
