					<p>Hiya, I have this old Belkin F5D6230-3 that I&#039;ve been messing around with, and unfortunately it seems nobody has documented it yet that I can tell.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably for good reason, since it only has 1MB of Flash and 8MB ram from what I&#039;ve found inside, and the components are very similar and some even identical to the Linksys BEFW11S4, possibly making it a clone.&nbsp; If this is the case, the Linksys one is unsupported, which means I&#039;m out of luck for an official OpenWRT port.</p><p>However, I still want to mess with this thing, just for the challenge itself.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the only ways I can tell so far to flash it are a JTAG header (3.3v, which apparently means no direct connection to the parallel port), and the uploader in the web interface.&nbsp; The latter sounds easiest, so that&#039;s what I was messing around with.&nbsp; I even considered flashing the Linksys&#039; firmware onto it to see if it would work, but the web interface firmware images require a header.</p><p>So that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been focusing on the last couple days, is how to decypher the header.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t match the Belkin Extended Header format that I saw for the more modern Belkins.&nbsp; At least one part of it does though, which is the actual image size.&nbsp; Using that, I was able to determine that the header is possibly 80 bytes (or at least the header + some other junk), since that&#039;s the difference between the size value in the header and the apparent start of ARM code in the firmware file (since I tried decompiling).</p><p>Actually, I&#039;m just reiterating a lot of stuff I already typed out elsewhere, if anyone&#039;s interested:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.fybertech.com/forums/index.php?topic=799">http://www.fybertech.com/forums/index.php?topic=799</a></p><p>The image file itself seems to be VxWorks, which I know nothing about.&nbsp; But it seems to be compressed using zlib from what I can find out.&nbsp; And scanning the file with find-zlib confirms zlib structures inside.&nbsp; I tried to find the actual compressed kernel/firmware in the image, but no luck.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a needle in a haystack until I go digging through disassembled code.&nbsp; And I can only assume the firmware gets launched at 0x0000 in the router, which makes it hard to test in any emulator.&nbsp; I tried qemu&#039;s arm emulator, but it only loads kernels, putting them at like 0x100000.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to dig through their kernel more to learn more about how this router works, if I could just get it out.</p><p>My focus though is currently the CRC in the firmware header.&nbsp; I think the four bytes following the image size in the header are the CRC, just like in the Belkin Extended Header format.&nbsp; Yet I&#039;ve run the image through CRC8/CRC16/CRC32/CRCCCITT (the latter just since it was in the same Perl module), and my Perl script increments the starting byte of the image to do a pass of each CRC type, trying to match it to that possible CRC value from the header, but to no avail.&nbsp; I also tried switching the byte order of the possible CRC, and even inverting the bits like I saw mentioned for the Extended, but still no match.</p><p>So I&#039;m mostly wondering if anyone has any idea what sort of method the CRC might be done in?&nbsp; Or better yet, does anyone know the older Belkin firmware header structure?&nbsp; I put a dump of the bytes in the link I mentioned above, if one needs to see it.</p><br /><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I put some photos of the board in the other link now finally.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FyberOptic</strong> on 29 Sep 2007, 23:21)</p>

					<p>Hey awesome, I was able to get the kernel image uncompressed after all.&nbsp; I had a Perl script working similar to the CRC search I had been doing, using zlib to attempt decompressing the firmware image, incrementing the starting byte for each pass, etc.&nbsp; But I was using &#039;inflate&#039; the whole time, which is why I had no luck.&nbsp; I used &#039;uncompress&#039; instead and totally found + extracted it.&nbsp; </p><p>But I still have that overall CRC problem in the firmware image header, so even if I do actually change anything in it, I can&#039;t upload it back to the web interface.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FyberOptic</strong> on 30 Sep 2007, 11:08)</p>
