					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently got hands on a Netgear WGT634 and wondered if it was possible to change the firmware that it is running.<br />(wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openwrtdocs/hardware/netgear/wgt624)<br />(That&#039;s how I found out about OpenWrt btw)<br />On the label it is marked as V2 but the web administration pages reports v3.<br />I did some research and all I found was very old posts saying support was nearly done.</p><p>While I was looking for that, I thought about other routers I had lying around.</p><p>One of them is a Philips SNV6520 (wiki.openwrt.org/toh/smc/smc7904)<br />And the last of them is a &quot;BBox2&quot; which is also distributed by other ISP under the names Orange Livebox2, AliceGate or Sagem F@st 3464</p><p>I did not find much about these ones.</p><p>So I was wondering if it was possible to put a version of OpenWrt on one/some/all of these machines. And how ? Using precompiled images ? Compiling them ? How to flash them once I got an image ?</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your answers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Renaud11232</strong> on 22 Jan 2018, 04:30)</p>
