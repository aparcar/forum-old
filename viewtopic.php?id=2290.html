					<p>Using WhiteRussian RC2, I have tried setting up a ppp link with dial on demand, but I have discovered that the ppp daemon is not compiled with support for the filtering expressions (active-filter and pass-filter). While pass-filter is not so useful, because I can always use iptables, active-filter is really necessary to set up a dial on demand system, since the background noise of the internet keeps the link up forever even with a 30 seconds idle timeout.</p><p>Now, should it be possible to include ppp filtering in the standard distribution, or to compile a different ppp package with support for filtering, allowing people to choose between the &quot;small&quot; and the &quot;full&quot; ppp package?</p><p>Also, I have read that libpcap 0.8.3 does not support the keywords &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot; for ppp traffic filtering, and a newer version should be needed.</p>									</div>
