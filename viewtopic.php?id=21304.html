					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have DD-WRT (latest version) installed on my Linksys WRT54GL 1.1, but I have got sick of it and started using pfSense on a &quot;real computer&quot; as my router. Connected to the pfSense router is a switch, and now I want to connect the WRT54GL to the switch and use it as a wireless access point with OpenWRT.</p><p>Can I update the firmware from the DD-WRT webinterface, or does that only work for other versions of DD-WRT?</p><p>When I download from the brcm-2.4 folder, should I choose openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx or openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin?</p><p>Does OpenWRT have a release schedule?&nbsp; The next version is promised to have the fixed wireless open source driver for the 2.6 kernel. When will it be released? In weeks? Months?</p><p>Will the access point need to run it&#039;s own DHCP and DNS servers, or is it enough that I run those on my pfSense router?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anon248</strong> on 4 Aug 2009, 23:25)</p>

					<p>Choose openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin<br />Yes you can upgrade from DD-WRT, but will of course loose all settingsé<br />Your access point doesn&#039;t have to run a DHCP/DNS server</p><p>I don&#039;t think there is a release schedule, but 8.09.1 was out not so long ago. I don&#039;t think you should wait for kernel 2.6 if you only need basic AP functions....</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I successfully updated my WRT54GL from DD-WRT to OpenWrt 8.09.1 (brcm-2.4/openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin) and enabled wireless with WPA2. It works without any problems.</p><p>It is connected through a switch to my main firewall/router (pfSense), that does NAT, DHCP and DNS. How do I disable NAT, DHCP and DNS in OpenWrt, so that the wireless clients will not be on a separate network, and be able to access the computers connected to the switch?</p>									</div>
