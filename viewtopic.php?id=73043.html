					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m seeking for some help with connecting to a device via serial console.<br />I have a CP1202 USB to TTL adapter, which I have successfully used to debrick a device before.<br />I&#039;m trying to connect to a Huawei D100, I soldered the connectors to the points described in the wiki (can&#039;t post links for some reason...). </p><p>I found that 115200 is probably the best rate, but using this, I get results like this (on Windows 8.1 + PuTTY)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>▒ecompressing....n.....done

On the Windows 8.1 computer I think the device detects constant keypresses, because it keeps spitting the help. Not on the Windows 10, but I can&#039;t use it there either, because keypresses don&#039;t work properly.</p><p>What could be causing this? Bad settings? Soldering error? Driver error?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>This looks suspiciously like a floating ground issue.
