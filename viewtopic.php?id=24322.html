					<p>Here are some instructions that phlorit posted over on the dd-wrt forum for installing openwrt on this router:</p><p>1. Boot to Ubuntu CD <br />After selecting your language, you may need to F4 and choose &quot;Safe Graphics&quot; to boot since the video driver for you machine may not load. </p><p>2. After Ubuntu boots you will need to set a preference <br />On the top NAV go to System&gt;Preferences&gt;Software Sources <br />And check the box: “Community-maintained Open Source Software (Universe)” </p><p>3. Click Reload on the popup message aft trying to close the screen </p><p>4. Open the Firefox browser and make sure you have Internet connection. If you don’t, you may need to mess around with network settings which are easily available in the upper right screen. </p><p>5. Open a “terminal” window <br />Goto: Applications&gt;Accessories&gt;Terminal </p><p>6. Type: sudo apt-get update (wait until screen finishes loading everything) <br />7. Type: sudo apt-get install tftp (wait until screen finishes loading everything) <br />8. Then reset the router you are trying to flash and leave it powered down or unplugged. (30/30/30) </p><p>In the short future or after we complete these commands, you will need to have the PC you’re working from and the router be on the same LAN so the PC can connect to the router. This can be accomplished in many ways. I used a switch to connect the router and PC together. Basically they have to talk to each other. Get this setup now… by plugging the Ethernet cables in the right spots. </p><p>9. Type: sudo service networking stop (not sure why and if this command does anything, but I left it in) <br />10. Type: sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.11.2 (This will set your machine’s IP) <br />11. Type: sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0 <br />12. Type: sudo arp –s 192.168.11.1 [MAC address of your router] eg.:00:00:00:00:00:00 <br />13. CD to the directory where you have the flash file / firmware (I had it on a USB drive and copied it to the desktop of Ubuntu. <br />14. Type: tftp <br />15. Type: verbose <br />16. Type: binary <br />17. Type: trace <br />18. Type: rexmt 1 <br />19. Type: timeout 60 <br />20. Type: connect 192.168.11.1 (BTW: Not sure about all routers, but the Buffalo will default to 11.1 at boot every time for the first 30 seconds or until boot completes.) <br />21: Type: put wzrg300nh-firmware.bin [or the name of your firmware file.] <br />22: PRESS ENTER! And immediately power on your router <br />In the terminal window you will see a connection attempt happening and when it connects a flurry of files being ftp’ed to the router. If the connect commands go until timeout, you have either done a wrong step in this guide, or you do not have the machines on the same LAN. </p><p>After the files are loaded <br />23. Type: sudo service networking start (not sure why and if this command does anything, but I left it in) <br />24. Router will take a while to load. Maybe about 5-6 minutes or so. When maintenance red light is out, you should be able to browser into the router at 192.168.1.1 (yes notice it is not 11.1).</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks like you might want &quot;luci-app-samba - 0.9.0-1 - Network Shares - Samba SMB/CIFS module.&quot;</p><p>Also you will need install the filesystem driver/module</p>									</div>
