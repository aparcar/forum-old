					<p>Hi<br />Does anyone have clarification of which versions of Linksys WRT54G/GS/GL are compatible with OpenWrt?&nbsp; The relevant page on the old wiki [1] says that the G up to V4 are ok and the same for GS, for the GL it shows 1 and 1.1.&nbsp; The new wiki [2] agrees for the G and GL but only shows V2.0 for the GS.</p><p>If it makes a difference I want to run OWFS (1-Wire file system).</p><p>Colin</p><p>[1] <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/hardware/linksys">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/hardware/linksys</a><br />[2] <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt54g</a></p>									</div>

					<p>So far I have encountered no saboteurs, who would wrongly claim a device is supported, which in fact is not.</p><p>The opposite is true: support for new or old devices is achieved but then nobody bothers to document this in the wiki. <strong>So, if a device is reported as supported in old OR in nuwiki, then it is most probably so.</strong> And if a device/version is not reported in the wiki, the device still could be supported :-(</p><p>The reason we have an oldwiki is a port from pmwiki? to dokuwiki. Not all content has been ported yet to nuwiki, because nobody thinks it&#039;s worth the bother.</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIR, nothing bigger then 4.0 will work with Linux.
