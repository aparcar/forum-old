					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am having a problem getting Samba3 to work on my DNS-120. I know this is really old hardware, but I just want to get the samba server installed and use it to share usb devices. I am an OpenWRT beginner, but I have managed to get OpenWRT installed, on the network, booting the usb and using a 1gb usb key as storage. OpenWRT Backfire 10.3 RC3.</p><p>I cannot get the samba server to work, however. I tried installing samba-server and samba-common but I wasn&#039;t able to get it to work - it ran, but I couldn&#039;t resolve it from any computer. I tried adding the hostname in the /etc/hosts file and it didn&#039;t help. I am able to ping the NAS from console by its Hostname on the NAS but not from the network.</p><p>Since samba2 wasn&#039;t working, I install luci-app-samba. First, no configuration screen for Samba appears in Luci. Beyond that, when I run the samba server by /flash/etc/init.d/samba start I get the following error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/rc.common: line 78: smbd: not found
/etc/rc.common: line 78: nmbd: not found</code></pre></div><p>and a check of PS does not show running samba server. I have read things to the effect that smbd and nmbd are not included with samba3, but I am at a loss as to why I can&#039;t start the service it if they aren&#039;t required. I would really like some help with this, and believe me I read for 2 days straight before asking in the forums.</p><p>thanks in advance, I&#039;ll be happy to provide any output if you can tell me what the commands are.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Jaguarius</strong> on 30 Apr 2010, 23:19)</p>

					<p>I think the problem probably lies in the fact I am installing the samba server on usb. I don&#039;t have enough internal flash to install it, so I installed it to /flash which is where I mounted my usb stick.</p><p>Do I need to edit /etc/rc.common in some way to point to the /bin folder on my flash? The files smbd and nmbd are indeed there in /flash/bin. If I run them manually, I don&#039;t see them in PS. And when I run samba, it still says smbd and nmbd not found when I run it.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I created a symlink from /flash/bin/smbd and nmbd to /bin/smbd and nmbd and samba does not give an error any longer when trying to start it, however it is not running when I look in PS. Don&#039;t know where to go from here.</p>									</div>

					<p>Try to start samba from CL and see if it print some errors. <br />Could be that you are missing some library modules, since it is installed on extenal media.<br />/etc/init.d/samba start<br />or you can try something like:<br />smbd -F -s /etc/samba/smb.conf</p><p>If complaining about mission modules, they are probably installed on the /flash device?<br />Look after /lib on your flash device, Then add something like this line to /etc/profile:<br />export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/flash/lib:/flash/usr/lib</p><p>BTW: You can also change the export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin to include your /flash/bin binary so you dont have to symlink every binary you install</p>									</div>
