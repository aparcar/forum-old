					<p>Hello All, first time installing router firmware and just looking for some guidance please.<br />Found the site for my router;<br />hxxps://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</p><p>.. but I am wondering what firmware is recommended for my router as I am only using this router as a PPTP/Russia PPTP VPN router hooked up to my main Rogers cable Modem/Router. </p><p>With the current TP-Link firmware, the router causes conflict with my main router like internet speeds are very erratic, like 20 MB - 200 MB down, very unstable plus the WiFi drops, etc, I&#039;m assuming due to NAT being enabled on both routers which I can&#039;t disable but you guys might know what the issue is better than I would. <br />So I&#039;m looking to install the firmware and which settings I should turn off as to not conflict with my main router.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>
