					<p>I turned it on to check out the stock firmware. All seems fine.</p><p>I tftp loaded the openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/brcm47xx/generic/.">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a â€¦ /generic/.</a> I waited 10 minutes, still no ping. So I popped the power. Still no ping. I popped the power while holding the WPS button to reset the settings. I see three successful pings, then the power light goes dark but the LAN light stays lit and the rest of the pings fail.</p><p>I can flash back to the Asus 3.0.0.4.372_1393 build and all is well. I tftp, wait 10 minutes, hold down the WPS and reboot. Wait another minute and everything is back to working.</p><p>It says H/W A1 on bottom and shipped with FW 3.0.0.4.246.</p><p>Ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>I just spent about two weeks trying to figure this out so I thought I&#039;d share the solution with you :-)</p><p>As far as I can tell RT-N16 support is only in the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; trunk builds known as Barrier Breaker.&nbsp; </p><p>I used the most recently dated firmware at this page. I used the Asus utility, never did get it to work via TFTP (I&#039;m on Windows).<br /><a href="http://openwrt.razvi.ro/">http://openwrt.razvi.ro/</a><br />Same brcm47xx sort of naming scheme. </p><p>All the steps should be the same with the holding reset button etc. It rebooted pretty much immediately, no waiting multiple minutes (I could tell since I had an infinite ping to 192.168.1.1 going). Your mileage may vary...</p>									</div>
