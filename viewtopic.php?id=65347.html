					<p>i suspected the same but then again, the chips that were on the board could not even be detected. this one that can&#039;t be written to has been desoldered from the board and the software detects it when connected using clip wires.</p><p>before i got ch341a i tried to copy content from other chip to this one while both were connected and most likely damaged it.</p><p>edit: if you flashed it two times and got wrong data written but 3rd flash succeeded you might check your software version. i&#039;ve seen newer versions do this but older versions (maybe 1.13 or 1.17) always flash it without errors.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anarchy99</strong> on 8 Jun 2016, 21:33)</p>

					<p>@anarchy99, Short Q:<br />Could be a problem if I&#039;ve used CH341A v1.17 Programmer software that have in list only <a href="https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/w25q128bv_revh_100313_wo_automotive.pdf">W25Q128<strong>BV</strong></a> instead of <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/W25Q128FV.pdf">W25Q128<strong>FV</strong></a> the last one being my original Chip too?</p><p>According to the manuals (BV version page 71 Ordering information section and FV version page 97), 128B or 128F the same density 128M-bit, V=2.7..3.6V in both cases.<br />I don&#039;t see any difference, more than that, I have successfully writen / verified the Bios chip and get into the windows again.</p><p>I&#039;ve received the above mentioned error &quot;Chip with the contents are in disagreement&quot; using v1.29 too.<br />Any thoughts? thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>i don&#039;t think so. haven&#039;t checked it precisely but i think you can even use preset for lower size chip if you need to write bootloader only. 16M (fullsize) preset is required if you need to flash full dump. and yes i&#039;ve also noticed difference between profiles, some will write data ok, other will write garbage, maybe something like endianess or some bytes flip no idea...</p>									</div>

I hope that these solutions can help you.</p>									</div>
