					<p>Ok here&#039;s a small howto for the USB stuff I just wrote:<br />&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/HowToInstallOntoUsbDrive">http://wiki.openwrt.org/HowToInstallOntoUsbDrive</a><br />It points to another small howto on usb drives... depending on how you want to work it.</p><p>OpenVPN is a fun little beast that takes a little while getting used to.&nbsp; I&#039;ve set up a couple of different configurations only - but can probably help.</p><p>You will probably need to open up some ports on the router - I&#039;m not sure if the scripts will do that for you automatically - and what ports will depend on what else you have to traverse/deal with at either ends.</p><p>For external ssh access you need to look in /etc/firewall.user - there&#039;s&nbsp; a sample on how to open up ssh.</p><p>What you need to know for OpenVPN:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Who needs access to what on either side?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there one computer each side - or is it a network?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you joining two networks on the same subnet?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What kind of keys do you want - pre-shared keys or certs? (Certs are always preferable)\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there static ip&#039;s or dynamic ip&#039;s?&nbsp; Who initiates contact?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there firewalls you need to traverse? Do you have control over them?</p>									</div>
