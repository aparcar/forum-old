					<p>It is an original TP-LINK TL-MR3220. Have made no changes to firmware (v2.0).<br />Tried to connect with ZTE RX326 but it shows NOT CONNECTED. I believe I should change the firmware, browsed the web and different forums but no success.<br />Not sure I have provided the needed information you have asked for...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zilvej</strong> on 3 May 2013, 21:55)</p>

					<p>No, that is not the information I wanted. What I wanted to know is, if it is supported by the linux kernel. One way to check that is to connect the modem to a PC running a recent linux kernel. Alternatively, it is possible to check the source code, if your modem model is supported. For that reason I would need the Product ID (PID) and Vendor ID (VID) of the modem. You can find those IDs in the device manager.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually MBS was really trying to help out. He was talking about the modem NOT the router.<br />If you ask whether a brand X modem works on a supported router, we need to know what the modem is.<br />Hence his post:</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>MBS wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>No, that is not the information I wanted.

This is a FREE of charge forum, and in my opinion with the focus of letting the whole project/comunity benefit. So, my intention is to guide people into the right direction, but they all have to solve their problems on their own with the additional benefit of learning how things work in embedded hardware, openwrt or linux.<br />Just my 2 cents.</p>									</div>
