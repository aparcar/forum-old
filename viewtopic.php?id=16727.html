					<p>hi,</p><p>I have a Linksys WAP55AG and I am trying to flash it.&nbsp; The upload starts but then a message is returned &quot;wrong firmware to upgrade&quot;.</p><p>I realize that this unit is listed as WIP but does that mean that the firmware I downloaded is not supported by the unit yet?</p><p>Also, as I am new to this site, most of the routers listed seem to be discontinued and out of production.&nbsp; How can I find current and in production routers that openwrt works with?</p><p>Thanks for helping a noob <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, the linksys wrtsl54gs, nslu2 (not really a router I realize) and some of the Asus and Buffalo products are good choices assuming you are okay with a broadcom chipset.&nbsp; Avoid most of linksys&#039; recent products as they are largely incompatible.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp; For future reference though, this probably should have been put in the general discussion forum.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>22bsti</strong> on 2 Sep 2008, 21:12)</p>
