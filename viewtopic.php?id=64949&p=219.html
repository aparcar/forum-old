					<p>Hi guys<br />Firstly, I’m very sorry if my question is noob-like.<br />I have a Linksys WRT3200ACM with LEDE SNAPSHOT r6565-fd588dbf6b / LuCI Master (git-18.088.49307-90ed423).<br />How can I install PPTP or IPSec server on it?<br />I tryed h_ttps://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.server.pptpd - useless, no connect to router both inside or outside my LAN. When I start pptpd /etc/init.d/pptpd start I see an error “sh: out of range”. I googled the same case h_ttps://forum.lede-project.org/t/default-config-file-for-pptpd-lacks-logwtmp-option/4795<br />Is it mean poptop package is buggy?</p><p>2nd question - why this repo doesn&#039;t have luci-app-ipsec-vpnd.ipk package? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Is it possible to use &quot;built-in&quot; Windows VPN connections for connection to this router? </p><br /><br /><p>If it is important - my ISP link uses PPPOE.</p><p>Great thanks for your advices!</p><p>P.S. Platform doesn&#039;t allow me to post URLs, just delete _ in h_ttps</p>									</div>

Why? Because the Lede morons havent still put a simple one button solution into OpenWrt to deactivate Ipv6. You have to hack yourself through it to fully deactivate it, do ALL these steps:</p><p>1. put net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 into /etc/sysctl.conf<br />2. /etc/init.d/odhcpd disable<br />3. remove the network IPv6 ULA-Prefix (important), set it to blank (luci: network-&gt;interfaces <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wHS38sB.png)">https://i.imgur.com/wHS38sB.png)</a><br />4. deselect &#039;bring up at boot&#039; for wan6 ( luci: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yv3yEms.png">https://i.imgur.com/yv3yEms.png</a> )<br />5. select disabled/disabled/disabledfor ipv6 dhcp server for lan ( luci: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XjPfA5c.png">https://i.imgur.com/XjPfA5c.png</a> ) </p><p>nasty, isnt it? THAT, and only THAT, should deactivate ipv6 on this build. the constant dnsmasq restart issues should now be fixed. the wan6 virtual interface still comes up afer this which also seems like a bug to me, but it doesnt matter.</p><p>@komodo_1 yes, seems so. just test it? look into /tmp/adb_list.overall and open one of the blocked entries on one of your clients in a browser which hasnt any adblock addon active.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 12 Apr 2018, 03:30)</p>

So it appears to be something about the 2.4 itself. I&#039;ve tried wpa2, wpa2 mixed. N mode, legacy and all combos I can think of. Any suggestions? Every thing else that can connect by 2.4 seems ok.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here is my experience with the 3200acm. In order to connect with the smart plug on 2.4G, I have to just use legacy mode and uncheck the WMM (wireless multimedia). However with this configuration I can only get a few hundred KB download speed with other devices.<br />In DD-WRT, you can enable the third radio (BT/WiFi combo) and there is no issue for smart plug to connect to it while the main 8964 2.4G radio can be configured to be useful.</p>									</div>
