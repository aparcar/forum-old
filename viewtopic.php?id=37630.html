					<p>I&#039;ve been rattling my brain for weeks trying to get to the bottom of this problem...</p><p>I have 3 TL-WR1043ND routers (1 AP, 2 client) connected to directional antennas to create a ~1200 and ~400 foot link between 3 buildings and most of the time it works perfectly, but some days the units wifi performance gets slower and slower until eventually it&#039;s unusable.&nbsp; Logging into the offending router (usually one of the clients, rarely the AP) and cycling the radio with the &#039;wifi&#039; command immediately fixes it for an indeterminate amount of time.&nbsp; The antenna connections are known to work with other units (WRT54GL running in G mode and backfire 10.03.1/kern 2.6), and the issue continues in HT40(+/-), HT20 and G mode.</p><p>Since restarting the radio immediately fixes it, I suspect theres an issue with the ath9k driver.&nbsp; Are there any diagnotics/logs that can help me pinpoint why the radios keep dying?</p>									</div>
