					<p>Hi,</p><p>I hope someone can help me. I have trawled the forum and doc sites but haven&#039;t found a solution or any pointers in the right direction.</p><p>I have a custom build of Backfire (10.0.3.1 RC4 svn revision 24045) installed on a TP Link WR741ND.</p><p>My problem is that when the WAN interface is down, or cannot route to my DNS server (e.g. modem is down), DNS resolution takes a very long time to time out. For example a single query will take around one minute per DNS server (in /etc/resolv.conf) before displaying a &quot;Bad Address&quot; error.</p><p>I would very much like to control this timeout, or at least understand what is going on in the background that is causing such a wait. </p><p>So far I have tried adding option in /etc/resolv.conf, and adding my AP hostname to /etc/hosts (there is a post that suggests this could help in some situations). Both to no avail.</p><p>Any pointers or ideas would be incredibly helpful.</p><p>thanks,<br />Adam</p><p>p.s. I am not running dnsmasq.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Yeah should have been clearer on that. I mean openwrt dns resolution timeout. </p><p>Best example is pinging a domain when logged in on the AP.</p><p>The timeout is pretty consistent so I&#039;m assuming there is some hard coded timeout somewhere (UClibc libraries?) but not being a developer I&#039;m not getting anywhere near knowing how to change these or override them.</p><p>thanks for the reply,<br />Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>I haven&#039;t tested this, but if the system resolver obeys the regular /etc/resolv.conf configuration then you can put the following in /etc/resolv.conf (where X is in seconds).</p><p>options timeout:X</p><p>This is as per the docs on <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/resolv.conf">http://linux.die.net/man/5/resolv.conf</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Sam,</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I tried that to no effect, it&#039;s like the options are ignored. Odd.</p><p>Adam</p>									</div>

					<p>This is now not an issue with (at least) uClibc-0.9.32</p><p>Resolv.conf options are now used. Tested on a trunk build for Tp-Link 741ND</p><p>If anyone is ever interested, with uClibc-0.9.30 resolv.conf options were ignored. The settings seemed hard coded and conformed to settings found in the resolv.c file (3 attempts per server with 10 second timeouts). Changing these and recompiling didn&#039;t seem to make the slightest bit of difference.</p>									</div>
