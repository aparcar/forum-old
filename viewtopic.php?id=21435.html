					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need a help.<br />Does openwrt supports IPsec tunnel with another appliance (like sonicwall, watchguard and fortinet)?<br />The unit that I&#039;ll run openwrt has to have 4MB flash, am I right?<br />Last, but not least, Which brand and model are supported, for this job? </p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>Francisco</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, </p><p>I&#039;ve had great success using IPsec-tools (racoon and setkey) for setting up IPsec tunnels to Juniper and Zyxel devices. I&#039;ve never had much success with OpenSwan, though on a 4MB router you may want to use IPsec tools just to keep the size down a little.</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve written an IPsec application for LuCI and OpenWRT though I can&#039;t contribute it back just yet. Within two weeks though I&#039;ll post it up. It&#039;s kind of mickey-mouse but it works with both IKE and manual keys. Hopefully someone can improve it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Here is an older ipsec-tools package with a mostly working init script and UCI config. I say &quot;mostly working&quot; because things like RSA certificates, transport mode, and manual keying probably don&#039;t work. However, a standard host-to-host tunnel mode config does work great.</p><p><a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/450614904/ipsec-tools.tar.gz">http://rapidshare.com/files/450614904/i â€¦ ols.tar.gz</a></p><p>I have a LuCI page that I can post later. If someone would like to play with this, clean it up, improve it, etc... please do! A solid IPsec implementation with UCI and LuCI has been lacking in OpenWrt for years.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 2 Mar 2011, 20:32)</p>
