					<p>I&#039;m using this little travel router for a specialized purpose which requires internet access and access to a LAN connected piece of hardware. The internet access I&#039;m getting by connecting the travel router wirelessly to my main router via &quot;hotspot mode&quot;, which I was hoping would leave the Ethernet port open for the LAN device. Unfortunately for me (and probably pretty obviously for anyone frequenting this forum), WAN ports and LAN ports are slightly different animals. Needless to say, it didn&#039;t work. </p><p>I understand that it&#039;s possible to turn a WAN port into a LAN port via custom firmware, but none of the usual suspects yet support this&nbsp; model. So, is there any other way of going about this or do I just have to hope this model gets open source firmware support in the near future? </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
