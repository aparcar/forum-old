					<p>How often do you see this log entry. Could it be tied to the lease length of a DHCPv6 address?</p><p>If it isn&#039;t showing up on your LuCI DHCPv6 lease list, then probably the device has a bad DHCPv6 client, and although the router has offered an address, the client isn&#039;t acknowledging it. The last part of the DUID is usually the MAC address of the device.</p><p>I would suggest looking at your ARP table on the router for the device who&#039;s MAC address ends in 22:b8 And you should see an IPv4 address that is associated with that MAC address.</p>									</div>
