					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am trying to interface an LCD display (<a href="http://www.crystalfontz.com/product/CFA632-YMC-KS">http://www.crystalfontz.com/product/CFA632-YMC-KS</a>) to a Wiligear WBD-500 board through the GPIO lines. I got it to work using the serial line without much difficultly; however, I want to use the serial lines to communicate with a PIC microcontroller. I&#039;ve seen packages to use the GPIO lines as an SPI interface, but nothing to make it a pseudo rs232 line. </p><p>So, has anyone does this before? Is it really even feasible, or would the timings be too far off even at 2400 baud?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>For short bursts of communication, you can probably create a software UART in a kernel module, by disabling interrupts and then doing your stuff, but your clock (and possibly other stuff) will get messed up if you take too long.</p><p>You can also use realtime extensions (https://www.rtai.org/) to give yourself a periodic task.&nbsp; At low baud speeds the interrupt jitter will probably be small enough for it to work.</p>									</div>
