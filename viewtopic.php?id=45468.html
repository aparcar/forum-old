					<p>Not quite sure if this is the best place to ask but my usual go to for linux help Ubuntu forums is down at the moment, I&#039;ll ask here first.</p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to set up a secondary router that would act as &quot;US&quot; network (I&#039;m in Canada). No root access on remote machine so I have to use sshuttle. I managed to get sshuttle to work on my openwrt..., I left it on overnight and it looks like ssh connection severed at some point. I know I can use the ServerAliveInterval to keep an active connection but not fullproof solution. Traditionally I&#039;ve used autossh to maintain an active ssh connection but it doesn&#039;t look like there&#039;s any built in integration functions for either of these. Both autossh and sshuttle allow you to specify custom &quot;ssh&quot; commands, but I tried both, neither works if I pointed one to another.</p><p>Any clues on how I can do this? One thing I&#039;ve yet to check is if sshuttle quits when the ssh connection is severed, I guess I can have a monitor that checks on the pid file generated by sshuttle and restart it whenever pid is killed. But I would love to know if autossh can do this for me.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Paul</p>									</div>
