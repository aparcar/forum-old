					<p>I&#039;ve successfully installed Kamikaze 8.09 on my Netgear WGT634U with the intention of configuring it as a WiFi packet sniffer. I have access to the serial port and I would like to dump WiFi packets onto the serial port. Currently, I&#039;ve been trying to use tcpdump, but I&#039;m open to anything that will do the job. The closest I&#039;ve come is the following:</p><p>1) Remove the &#039;option disabled&#039; line from the /etc/config/wireless file fore wifi0.<br />2) run the following<br />- wlanconfig ath0 destroy<br />- wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor<br />- ifconfig ath0 up<br />- tcpdump -i ath0</p><p>This doesn&#039;t work quite as expected, since it stops after a while and also because the information is a little too low-level for me. I&#039;m looking for something more on the packet level, similar to what would happen if I ran tcpdump on the WAN device (eth0). Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve come up with another idea. I think I could solve this problem if I could reverse the roles of the WAN port and the wifi card (that is, have the router forward packets received over wifi to the ethernet ports). Though I&#039;m not concerned about actually putting the packets out on the ethernet ports, I imagine this would be done by configuring the wifi0 device exactly as the ethernet devices are configured.</p><p>[Edit]<br />Is there a way to get DHCP to run from the wifi device?</p><p>Also, is there a reason why it says the &#039;nvram&#039; command is not found? Do the files in /etc/config/ take its place?<br />[/Edit]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nevsan</strong> on 21 Apr 2009, 08:16)</p>

					<p>As far as I have seen the WGT634U have an USB port and in that case shouldn&#039;t it be easier to sniff with tcpdump (or tshark) and store the data on an USB stick connected to the USB port on the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>However I do it, I still can&#039;t set it up to get the information I need. The reason I had used the serial port is because I&#039;m feeding the data to a microprocessor. Thanks, though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nevsan</strong> on 21 Apr 2009, 20:00)</p>
