					<p>Have you made any progress with this???&nbsp; Lifted pads are bad.&nbsp; You may have to scratch the green coating off of the board with a blade to try to find the copper path underneath that the pad connected to.&nbsp; Then, you&#039;ll have to somehow solder to that.&nbsp; This can be quite difficult &amp; will cause some suffering.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need a bright light &amp; a good magnifying lens or jeweler&#039;s loupe.</p>									</div>
