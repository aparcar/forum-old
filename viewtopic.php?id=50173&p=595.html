This just means, that the majority of people dont come here to &quot;complain&quot;, dont know their router doesnt work properly, or they use the original firmware (what I dont want to). What does this also mean? If I want to use Lede/OpenWrt I am forced to use Davids &quot;build&quot; because there are no alternatives. And if I use it and user x and user y have problems z, than I will have them too OR their router has a hardware defect. If many users have the same issues it is highly improbable the user has a hardware defect. I am not a &quot;simple&quot; user. I want to use the router under heavy CPU load, 5GHz wifi, lots of clients (20-30) and I expect zero reboots, zero problems with the Wifi, always max Wifi performance. Anyway, my WRT1200AC v2 is already shipped and will be here tomorrow or on Saturday. The first thing I will do is put latest build of Davids on it and &quot;hope&quot; for the best. I just wanted to know, under current build, that if a 99.9% stable operation is not guranteed for a WRT1200AC v2 with current Lede builds/wifi driver/4.9 kernel and what the chances for it are to work stable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 17 Nov 2017, 05:07)</p>

And if I use it and user x and user y have problems z, than I will have them too OR their router has a hardware defect. If many users have the same issues it is highly improbable the user has a hardware defect. I am not a &quot;simple&quot; user. I want to use the router under heavy CPU load, 5GHz wifi, lots of clients (20-30) and I expect zero reboots, zero problems with the Wifi, always max Wifi performance. Anyway, my WRT1200AC v2 is already shipped and will be here tomorrow or on Saturday. The first thing I will do is put latest build of Davids on it and &quot;hope&quot; for the best. I just wanted to know, under current build, that if a 99.9% stable operation is not guranteed for a WRT1200AC v2 with current Lede builds/wifi driver/4.9 kernel and what the chances for it are to work stable.</p></blockquote></div><p>You could use snapshot builds, make your own build, use 17.1.4 or run gargoyle. All builds have there own quirks. The most unstable thing for these routers is the 5 GHZ and that is because of the wifi driver it all depends on what wifi clients you have, some people dont have any dropouts but then some people have a lot. I have a wrt3200acm and have uptimes of 10 days +. Then again i just use my 3200 as a router all wifi is handled by a c7 set up as a dumb AP, all QOS DNS UPNP DNSCrypt Addblock routing firewall EG EG is on the wrt3200acm. Hope this helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tend to look at it this way.......&nbsp; When one counts all the different sources.. I.E. Trunk, 3rd party (derived from trunk) and stable builds, and the amount of 1200ac, 1900ac(x), and 3200acm downloads per week, which is easily in the thousand(s), there is a small percentage of people having issues.&nbsp; There&#039;s no documentation to the following statement, but of those remaining people who have issues, I&#039;d say 50% of those issues are usually solved over time. This leaves the other half to make a decision on if they can live with the issue, try another build, go back to Stock, or buy another unit/Brand. I have found in many cases if one just waits a few weeks, one of the developers will catch the issue and push a commit to fix it without any user intervention. There are other cases, like with wifi, where everone&#039;s hands are tied, and we just have to wait, and over time slowly receive a honed driver. Dealing with that, and this is just me, if the driver was that bad, I&#039;d just buy and configure a good AP, disable the Linksys wifi, and hit the ground running. Fortunately, I&#039;ve never had to do that, but it is certainly a cheap option if forced upon me.&nbsp; </p><p>Bottom line is the reason why we are here is because we want or need features the Stock firmware just doesn&#039;t deliver on, and there&#039;s a FREE way to get those features; using LEDE/OpenWrt. With that said, for this open source software, which has been collectively put together over the years, I&#039;d say it is very successful, but not without its own issues that I believe are the nature of the beast. </p><p>My 2 cents --</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello there,</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if anyone could possibly help me please.</p><p>I&#039;m very new to OpenWrt and finding it all quite confusing, but have managed to get &quot;LEDE Reboot 17.01.4 r3560-79f57e422d / LuCI lede-17.01 branch (git-17.290.79498-d3f0685)&quot; working on my WRT 1900ACS v2.</p><p>I followed a guide on youtube and it was working fine.</p><p>However I have noticed that the 2.4ghz channel will preiodically stop working. 5ghz is always fine, but 2.4ghz will not accept wifi logins. It will say &quot;disabled&quot; on my phone wifi settings and will look like it is going to connect and then doesn&#039;t.</p><p>Turning the router off and on again restores 2.4ghz for a half day or day, and then it stops working again. I had no problems with the stock firmware, but I changed as the wifi range was SO bad. Lede has much better range, but I can&#039;t use it if 2.4ghz won&#039;t work.</p><p>Can someone please help me? Sorry if this is a known issue or I have missed the proper procedure, but this is super complex for me! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi thanks for the tip.</p><p>After some confusion, I worked out how to do this, but when I try and install the latest MWLWIFI from github through the Luci interface, it says &quot;failed to download&quot; &quot;WGET returned 8&quot;. I assume 8 is an error code.</p><p>I see people saying to install typing in the wget function, but I don&#039;t know how. Is that in &quot;putty&quot;?</p>									</div>
