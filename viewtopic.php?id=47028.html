					<p>i have in the ballpark of about $50 to spend on a new router.. there are three options im considering</p><p>first option is the WR703N.. its a very small, and very cheap (about $25) 802.11N router with a USB port.. no LAN ethernet, but all of the devices i currently have connect through wifi anyway.. seems to be a lot of third party modifications for it too</p><p>the WDR4300 costs around $60.. it includes everything, gigabit LAn, i believe 450mbps wifi, a/b/g/n, three external antennas, and even two USB ports.. plus 8mb FLASH and 128mb RAM meaning this router could do seemingly everything</p><p>lastly is the raspberry pi.. not even a router, however it does include a 700mhz processor, plenty of storage space, ram, one ethernet port and a couple USB ports.. apparently openwrt is being worked on for this device, and people could add a linux compatible USB wifi dongle to use as a wireless router.. if true, then this with its onboard SD, tons of ram, rather large processor, this would make a nearly infinitely upgradable wireless router allowing me to install a different USB dongle and drivers to upgrade in the future, add 3g capabilities</p><p>so.. my question here is.. what is the best value here.. what would be the best long term option?.. personally, im leaning towards the 703n due to its low cost, compact size, and capability of fully running open-wrt giving me a very cheap and easy solution to openwrt customizability on any network..</p><p>any thoughts or opinions?</p>									</div>

					<p>The three machines are all good in their own right, but very different to each other. To get a informed recommendation for one or the other, you really need to be a little more specific about what tasks you need them to carry out.</p>									</div>

					<p>hmm. well, now that i think of the raspberry pi idea.. the wifi would have to be USB.. that would limit me to what? 480mbits?, which will probably bottleneck the overall performance as a wireless router and restrict future upgradability though the processor, ram, flash would all be fine.. that bottleneck still makes it useless for future use as a router, or even current use</p><p>and if im going to use the router for gaming, then at some point im going to start hard wiring more of my devices to a router.. so, that crosses out the WR703N.. leaves me with the WDR4300 or the WR1043ND and the WDR4300 is only $10 more, has a much faster CPU, a ton more RAM, and an extra USB port meaning, an all around superior router for just an extra $10 more than that $50</p>									</div>

					<p>Right. If you are in the market for <em>a router</em>, I&#039;d suggest you get <em>a router</em>. Multiple ethernet ports, solid Wifi performance, some RAM and flash memory so you don&#039;t hit a wall as soon as you want it to do more than just the basic tasks. The WDR4300 and the WR1043ND are both equally suitable.</p><p>I don&#039;t even know why you put the WR703N and the Raspberry Pi into the mix, other than they might be &quot;en vogue&quot; or inexpensive. They are both niche models, and if you need the niches they excel in, you&#039;d know why to get one. But they are not suitable as a baseline everyday router.</p>									</div>

					<p>well id actually like something that could do all i need to do for the next 3 years or so, wait until 802.11AC comes down in price.. i like a USB port i can connect a usb hard drive up to, run a torrent client on the router itself for over night downloads.. so.. i was thinknig of trying to find something cheaper, but good enough (with 300mbit WLAN, gigabit ethernet with enough RAM and flash for some flexibility with openwrt.. dont need anything too spectacular as i want to upgrade to AC in a few years</p>									</div>

					<p>My recommendation is to pick up a regular router, something like the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045HHTGW/?tag=blogqnologyco-20">Belkin 600 HD </a> for $35. Dual Band, Gigabit and Dual USB Ports.</p><p>Run Tomato USB on it -<br/><a href="http://blog.qnology.com/2012/12/tutorial-apple-airplay-on-tomatousb.html">http://blog.qnology.com/2012/12/tutorial-apple-airplay-on-tomatousb.html</a></p><p>Do not use your router as a NAS or to download torrents. Yeah it (barely) works, but you&#039;ll not be happy with it. Router CPUs are typically too slow.</p><p>Instead consider picking up a Pogoplug and hacking it to run Arch Linux ARM. Run all the things you wish your router had to power to do on your Pogoplug instead - SAMBA/NAS, BitTorrent, etc.</p><p><a href="http://blog.qnology.com/2013/03/tutorial-pogoplug-e02-with-arch-linux.html">http://blog.qnology.com/2013/03/tutorial-pogoplug-e02-with-arch-linux.html</a></p>									</div>
