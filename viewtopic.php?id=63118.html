					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I need help with a comfast ap-9341fe that comes with an OpenWRT rippoff called RipleOS</p><p>I compiled an openwrt version using a patch submitted some months ago but the RipleOS web interface does not accept it ( sysupgrade or factory image ).&nbsp; The patch applied cleanly to commmit 710dedaf50c548ce5e3e29422b98a345677c3857 on Chaos Calmer. The router has dropbear listening on port 9522 but I can&#039;t find a way of getting a shell.</p><p>I do have a firmware that the web interface accepts for flashing named RippleOS-v4.9.1-git4871-ap9341fe-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin. </p><p>My idea is that maybe with a bit of cut and paste one can strip the header from the RippleOS file and use it on the OpenWRT file, but I need help with this.</p><p>Here is a link with the patch I used, the file I compiled and the RippleOS file that the web interface accepts for flashing.</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xpfn28iwzs2wro4/AACmI08VReFcu17u00gR4_dMa?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xpfn28iwzs2w â€¦ 4_dMa?dl=0</a></p><br /><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>

					<p>It appears that versions older than RippleOS 4.5 allow to flash openwrt-sysupgrade files. The problem is that RippleOS 4.9.1 ( the version installed ) does not allow version 4.5 to be flashed.</p><p>What I did was to replace the header ( 64bytes ) from the RippleOS-v4.5 file with the one from the RippleOS-v4.9.1 file.</p><p>It didn&#039;t work, so what I did next was to change the &quot;data crc&quot; on the header with the crc value that was on the RippleOs-v4.5 file. Remember that the header had the data crc from the v4.9 file.</p><p>It also didn&#039;t work. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I think I must also recalculate the header crc ( as changing the data crc on it probably invalidaded that value ).<br />how can I do that?<br />I added the file to the dropbox link above.</p><br /><br /><p>this is the resulting file, with the correct data crc but wrong header crc:<br />DECIMAL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HEXADECIMAL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DESCRIPTION<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;uImage header, header size: 64 bytes, header CRC: 0x1DBCBF52, created: 2015-09-01 16:03:08, image size: 920939 bytes, Data Address: 0x80060000, Entry Point: 0x80060000, data CRC: 0x5F59220, OS: Linux, CPU: MIPS, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: lzma, image name: &quot;&quot;<br />64&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x40&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x6D, dictionary size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: 2773764 bytes<br />1572864&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x180000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, compression:xz, size: 2741326 bytes, 1308 inodes, blocksize: 262144 bytes, created: 2015-04-22 13:47:08</p><br /><br /><p>any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>So, I found out how to calculate the u-boot header checksum ( just zero the current checksum and then calculate the crc32 of the 64bytes ). </p><p>I also found that if I pick a file that I know the web interface accepts for flashing and change it with a non-sense data checksum or header checksum, it will still take the file!!! So the flashing counter-measure must come after that.</p><p>Can&#039;t mount the squashfs filesystem or unshash it even with sasquash. I&#039;m running out of options.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> </p><p>who want&#039;s to give it a try?</p>									</div>
