					<p>I am seting up a cafe network and i want to seperate the network into two parts. One for guests, and one for employes/known people.</p><p>I understand that the radio need to support broadcasting two networks. The router should also have sufficient hardware to support 10 people with light traffic such as web browsing and smart phones syncing, browsing, etc.</p><p>What kind of router is recomended for this kind of use, and with OpenWrt compatibility?</p>									</div>

					<p>That seems like a good choice. One of my co-workers also recommended Linksys E3200. Any other suggestions? I will make a decision this weekend.</p>									</div>

					<p>every router supported by openwrt should be able to run this. <br />Maybe you should look into a router with detachable antennas, but this depends on the size of your cafe, and the spatial arrangement.<br />The WNDR3800 is a nice device but might be an overkill, unless you want to run (and can run) your private network on 5GHz only. Many clients especially smartphone only support 2.4GHz. </p><p>But you can run multiple ssids (with seperate subnets and firewall-zone) on just one physical wifi without any issues, on allmost any device. <br />So even a device like the TL-WR741ND which you will get for 15euros will work for this. if your internet-access has more than 50Mbit you might get a device with a 300Mbit Wifi e.g. TL-WR841ND or TL-WR842ND. But there is really no need to spend 80euro for this, and you can&#039;t upgrade the antennas of the WNDR3800 if you have issues with signalquality</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 27 Jul 2012, 19:45)</p>

					<p>For newbies I recommend the D-Link DIR-825.&nbsp; It supports concurrent 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz traffic and has decent CPU horsepower and RAM (64MB).&nbsp; It is supported in the stable branch (Backfire). </p><p>Personally I use the the TL-WDR4300.&nbsp; It better specs than the DIR-825 but is only supported on the main trunk currently and requires text-mode provisioning without the LuCI GUI.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not recommended for newbies (yet).</p>									</div>

					<p>A word of warning.&nbsp; There&#039;s a possible problem with backfire with regard to this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to disable my guest wireless SSID since updating from kamikaze to backfire 10.03.1.&nbsp; On my system, as long as the second wireless network existed, it would always eventually stop routing between the (primary) LAN and (primary) wireless after about a half an hour. It acts as if &quot;isolate&quot; is on, even though it works fine for a while (and I&#039;ve explicitly set isolate to &#039;0&#039;).&nbsp; The only way to get it back is to restart networking or reboot.&nbsp; </p><p>I had the obvious straightforward setup involving a bridged lan+wifi pair for the main local network and another bridged lan+wifi pair for the &quot;guest&quot; network.&nbsp; Both were identically configured except for SSID, interface names and passwords.</p><p>Deleting the extra wireless network made the problem go away, where no amount of messing about with the firewall or wireless did.&nbsp; (I even tried explicitly allowing lan-lan forwarding, but it made no diffference.)&nbsp; I haven&#039;t diagnosed this problem in detail though I want to get it solved eventually.</p><p>Multiple SSIDs worked great for me in kamikaze.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is with an Alix 2D13 (i586) + DCMA-82 MiniPCI (Atheros AR5006) and madwifi.&nbsp; (Had too many other problems with ath5k, including poor throughput.)&nbsp; Your mileage may vary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>spiggott</strong> on 28 Jul 2012, 22:47)</p>
