					<p>Since I have not recieved a response to my earlier query about using a CIFs share to install wireless snort (because I don&#039;t have enough space to install it on my wrt54g) I would would like see the source for the installation procedure for wireless snort.</p><p>I unpacked the pkg file at <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nico/testing/mipsel/packages/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nic â€¦ /packages/</a> but I don&#039;t see the source there. Or is it in the &quot;.content&quot; files?</p><p>Can someone tell me where the source is so I may try to hand install wireless snort for my WRT54G/openwrt using a CIFS share to store it?</p><p>Thanks!<br />Siegfried</p>									</div>
