					<p>I have a setup at home as follow:</p><p>DHCP clients&nbsp; -----&gt; (wifi)(bridge) Openwrt -----&gt; (eth)Main Router</p><p>The device I&#039;m using is TPlink MR3020 with Barrier Breaker and I tried to set up transparent proxy for bridge traffic - I want to redirect the packets passing through the bridge to proxy server(`privoxy`). I tried to use `ebtables`. But when I enter the following command: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p IPv4 --ip-protocol 6 --ip-destination-port 80 -j redirect --redirect-target ACCEPT </code></pre></div><p>I got following error:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unable to update the kernel. Two possible causes:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Multiple ebtables programs were executing simultaneously. The ebtables<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; userspace tool doesn&#039;t by default support multiple ebtables programs running<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; concurrently. The ebtables option --concurrent or a tool like flock can be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; used to support concurrent scripts that update the ebtables kernel tables.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The kernel doesn&#039;t support a certain ebtables extension, consider<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; recompiling your kernel or insmod the extension.</p><p>I tried to activate the IPv4 package with `insmod`, but no luck.</p><p>Any ideas on how to accomplish this?</p>									</div>

					<p>bolvan, you are right. </p><p>However, I have seen the same error when asking ebtables to do L4 filtering (TCP is L4), it doesn&#039;t appear to be supported on OpenWRT. One has to use iptables to do L4 filtering.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for answer cvmiller, but I want to filter only http and https and other ports should not be intercepted in the bridge traffic. So, what I want to do is taking only port 80 and 443&nbsp; connection in the bridge traffic and redirect them to the proxy. Are you sure OpenWRT does not support L4 filtering with ebtables ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think I understand what you are trying to do, and it sounds reasonable. However, when I was attempting to get the brouter project going, I ran into similar errors until I removed the L4 in the filter. That is why I went with &quot;mark&quot; and let iptables do the L4 filtering.</p><p>However, this may not work for you, since you are not creating a firewall, but rather a selective proxy.</p><p>The easiest way to debug this is to start removing components of your ebtables filter, until you get no errors. Then you can determine which parts of the line are causing problems.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>
