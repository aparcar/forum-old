					<p>Hi guys, new to openwrt and TP-Link routers. From reading the reviews it seemed this router was a solid budget buy and it arrived today so I was keen to get going. According to the reviews on Amazon I saw, the version shipping was v7. Turned out to be v11.1...</p><p>Now I&#039;ve read that v11 of this router works fine with the snapshot version but now I&#039;ve read elsewhere that v11.1 only has 1MB Flash...</p><p>Ideally I was after a straightforward affair using the TP Link GUI to flash to openwrt but with the contradictory information I&#039;ve read I&#039;m unsure. Can anyone help clear this up for me please? Links to the latest guides and any pointers would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Any pointers please folks? Even a suggestion of a new budget router? I don&#039;t want to risk bricking this while I can still return it.</p><p>Has anyone actually successfully used the v11.1 with openwrt?<br />The link below does seem to suggest the v11.x is not supported but... as of 2016-04-01, it says you can use v10 15.05 images and do a sysupgrade -F to override the hardware check. Does this mean I need to flash via TFTP?</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phalsewrt</strong> on 11 Jul 2016, 23:14)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m pretty desperate for a budget router that has foolproof OpenWrt support too, but I&#039;ve been looking for weeks and I can&#039;t find one. I tried the TP-LINK Archer C20i, but the flash failed and it&#039;s now bricked (despite me following the instructions exactly).</p><p>The main reason I want OpenWrt is for the fq_codel SQM, so I need the budget router to also have a minimum of 8MiB Flash.</p><p>The problem with the 841ND that you have is that it should only have 4MiB of flash. So technically OpenWrt should work on it but many features will be missing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve settled on the TP-LINK Archer C20i AC750 Wireless Dual Band Router as there only seems to be 1 version of that so hopefully I won&#039;t have the same problem as I did with the WR-841ND v11.1!</p><p>Plus it&#039;s only Â£4 more than the WR-841. Unfortunately it looks like 5ghz doesn&#039;t work but I can handle that for now. Do these things change in future releases? Also looks like it can be upgraded from the gui easy enough. I just don&#039;t have the time at the moment.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phalsewrt</strong> on 14 Jul 2016, 11:39)</p>
