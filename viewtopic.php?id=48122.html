					<p>the nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf defines the dns server used by the sytem and it points to 127.0.0.1<br />on 127.0.0.1 runs dnsmasq and that is used to resolve the request.</p><p>by default dnsmasq uses the file /tmp/resolv.conf.auto this file also gets updated by the dhcp client and would contain the dns servers gotten via dhcp from the provider.<br />The file used by dnsmasq for the lookup can be changed under /etc/config/dhcp</p><p>The option dns would get written to /tmp/resolv.conf.auto that is defined under /etc/config/network under an inteface.<br />However it gets appended to the dns settings it gets trough dhcp</p><p>So you are better of creating a new resolv file, /etc/resolv.conf.manual for example and change the setting in /etc/config/dhcp . via the uci command: <em>uci set dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].resolvfile=&#039;/etc/resolv.conf.manual&#039;; uci commit dhcp</em><br />Or you could of course edit the file as well</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 31 Dec 2013, 21:14)</p>

					<p>Thank you, but where is the info about currently used dns servers stored? On windows, there&#039;s ipconfig /all, what about in openwrt? Into which config file/section does that option peerdns belong?</p><p>What I&#039;m trying to achieve is to use openwrt as dns server, but openwrt should reject isp dns server (option peerdns seems nice) and use opennic servers (without logging) and yet filter out ads using hosts block list for the network.</p><p>Btw. some time ago I have seen online tool, which printed out, from which dns server(s) came the request and if is the dns is hijacked by isp.
