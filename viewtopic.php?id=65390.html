					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;ve been happily using OpenWrt for about 5-6 years now with several devices, though I do lack fundamental Linux CLI skills.&nbsp; I have been using a few different D-Link devices over the years and more recently a TP-Link WDR4300 all with great success with OpenWrt.</p><p>I finally saved up money for a TP-Link Archer C7 (v2) and bought it today brand new.&nbsp; It had an older firmware from 2014, therefore I was not worried about firmware being blocked.&nbsp; I confirmed that hardware version is 2.</p><p>The TP-Link web interface accepted the OpenWrt firmware (<em>openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin</em>) successfully and restarted without any issues.</p><ul><li><p>From this point, I was not able to access the OpenWrt web interface at 192.168.1.1 or any other potential addresses.&nbsp; I cannot ping 192.168.1.1 or any other familiar addresses either.</p></li></ul><p>From Windows ipconfig /all:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Ethernet adapter Ethernet:

So put the shovel aside (as &quot;stop digging&quot; is advisable) and realize there are two extremes in the forum behavior continuum. Friendly, forgiving and helpful on the one side and pedantic, nit-picky, hostile and unhelpful on the other end. Fell free to pick your place, but do not complain if after a while you get treated according to the position you took.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personally I would appreciate if you could get over the urge to tell people off and simply only answer to those posts where you have something substantial to add (IIRC those are plenty, unfortunately eclipsed by the barrage of hostile-sounding one-liners, or better one-worders, you seem to shoot off almost constantly).</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank those of you who took time out of your day by replying to my issue and providing various insightful, helpful information that indeed helped raise my overall knowledge of OpenWrt.&nbsp; I appreciate your help and I am thankful for the OpenWrt community.</p><p>I was lucky in this case and ending up getting into Failsafe Mode and re-flashing with one of <strong>arokh</strong>&#039;s recent builds since his builds are from trunk and are a high enough revision number to cover the latest flash chip in the C7 2.0 that had changed around December 2015 according to the wiki.&nbsp; The experience thus far since has been phenomenal and straight forward.</p><p>This is something that users may need to be careful with when buying a new Archer C7 these days.&nbsp; I suppose my biggest issue here is that I was following the C7 wiki details from (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500</a>) which was always the first search result in Google.&nbsp; But it appears that page is slightly outdated and suggests that users follow this link (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/ar â€¦ c7-wdr7500</a>) which contains more up-to-date information and follows the new Table of Hardware capabilities.&nbsp; Therefore it is on that second wiki page which contains the following important details that I had missed regarding revision number:</p><p><em>&quot;In late 2015 the V2 changed to flash chip gd25q128, affected serial numbers start with 215C or higher. The chip is supported in trunk as of r47588 and 15.05.1 as of r49220&quot;</em></p><p>Would it be worthwhile for whomever has access to edit the OpenWrt wiki pages to have that initial older wiki page for the C7 automatically redirect to the current C7 wiki page?</p><p>Anyway, this is a mistake of my own and I take full responsibility.&nbsp; I appreciate all of the suggestions that you have all provided me with.&nbsp; To be quite honest, I am thankful that this difficult situation has occurred because it forced me to do many hours worth of research and testing into OpenWrt and my overall knowledge has grown by leaps and bounds over the past 48 hours.</p><p>Cheers!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
