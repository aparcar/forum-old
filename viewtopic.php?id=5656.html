					<p>Hi mbm,</p><p>as an update. For some reason I got the device in failsafe mode again.

					<p>Hi tasiak,</p><p>I have the same layout as in the article.<br />With pin 9+10 is it a little bit difficult because of the right moment to detach the short-circuit.<br />Please tray the following.</p><p>Start the little program for seeing the right time for Failsafe mode, make the short-circuit, plug in the power, wait until the power led is up, detach the short-circuit.

					<p>I know this thread is a little old, but I thought I would chime in my two bits here since I just got a 2300 off eBay (and promptly flashed with OpenWRT). They are much cheaper than WRT54G&#039;s and just as capable, but have a few different settings.</p><p>First, about the LEDs... The Linksys defaults are different than the Dell, in the /etc/init.d/S99done script, the last thing is does is reset the LEDs to a &quot;normal&quot; state. However, this is what shuts off the Dell Power LED... To remedy this change the figure to 0x01 and the power LED will stay on. (Or you can probably just remove or comment out the line completely.)</p><p>Second, the Dell doesn&#039;t use VLANs (as you would have found in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration">wiki pages</a>).</p><p>Third, I could not connect to my router after rebooting it. The problem was with the dhcp server. I discovered on my own (after checking the log) that I was missing an NVRAM variable, and another was incorrect. Read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/dnsmasq">section 3.1</a> and it will explain the error &amp; fix (wish I found that page sooner).</p><p>After those few hurdles (and setting an rdate script on startup) my 2300 has been churning away quite hapily. I only wish I could have gotten one with the serial port header (like in the picture above). If you are patient on eBay you can pick up a used 2300 for ~$15 shipped (give or take).... making them an extreme bargain compared to a WRT54G which go for anywhere from $30 - $50 shipped (or more)!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EOC_Jason</strong> on 4 Sep 2006, 07:07)</p>

					<p>Hi pyrates!</p><p>Yes I did fix mine.</p><p>In picture I posted is an error. The flash chip is on the other side of PCB. </p><p>In fact vendor of flash is Intel. You have to take your router apart to access flash chip. </p><p>Look at this photo:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://sisq.home.pl/pub/tm2300/tm2300step01.jpg" alt="http://sisq.home.pl/pub/tm2300/tm2300step01.jpg" /></span></p><br /><p>Then locate flash chip and look for biggest dot on one of it&#039;s corners - first pin there is no.1</p><p>Check out picture:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://sisq.home.pl/pub/tm2300/tm2300step02.jpg" alt="http://sisq.home.pl/pub/tm2300/tm2300step02.jpg" /></span></p><p>I didn&#039;t turn on the wait_boot to on in the nvram either.</p><p>I connected router to PC running XP thru switch/hub as diagram shows*:<br />ROUTER &lt;--ETHERNET CABLE--&gt; ETHERNET SWITCH &lt;--ETHERNET CABLE--&gt; PC</p><p>* I did that to prevent loosing static arp binding that we will set up next, while router reboots time and time again.&nbsp; </p><p>Setup your PC to use static IP address of 192.168.2.2 and netmask 255.255.255.0.</p><p>On PC use command: arp -s 192.168.2.1 00-00-00-00-00-00 <br />where 00-00-00-00-00-00 is MAC address of Your bricked router.<br />This will set an static IP to MAC address binding just to make sure that IP address 192.168.2.1 is Your router. MAC number you will find on back sticker (even if you used MAC address cloning it will be still this MAC address from sticker on the back).</p><p>IP is in my case 192.168.2.1(default settings) after de-bricking (before I bricked mine it was IP 10.0.0.1).</p><p>Steps that I used to de-brick my router:</p><p>Step 0: Get ready to short-circuit <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />Step 1: Power off<br />Step 2: Power on<br />Step 3: Short-circuit ~1sec. (PINs 9&amp;10 on flash chip)<br />Step 4: Press reset button<br />Step 5: Voila! Ping works!<br />Step 6: Use tftp to put back original dell firmware </p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>TasiaK</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tasiak</strong> on 13 Oct 2006, 02:36)</p>
