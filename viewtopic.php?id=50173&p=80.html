I&#039;ll flash this in a bit <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> Thank You for uploading this! I was just wondering 2 things: 1 can you upload the config file? and 2 is this a minimal image (i don&#039;t mind command line but just wondering).&nbsp; update: i see luci is installed from he packages on the linked server <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>What do you mean by ddr/wifi? As you can tell im a novice and dont really understand what everything is <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p></blockquote></div><p>Any real reason to flash Kaloz&#039;s image for those of us already running lifehacksback?</p><p>Way I see it:</p><p>* both have 3.18.1 (and luci) (and wifi)<br />+ lifehacksback&#039;s is possibly a more minimal build ?<br />+ Kaloz&#039;s has temperature sensors (but no fan speed adjustment)</p><p>Thanks to both of you though for your efforts <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve tried both, path of least resistance(ease of use ) = @lifehackisback&#039;s.</p>									</div>

					<p>@Kaloz, would you be able to share the .config/any other modifications outside of git used to make the build you uploaded?

					<p>Yeah <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> it seems to be the wireless driver on my macbook under os X 10.10.1 that is causing the connection problems. Not only that but it seems every os except linux has a decrease in performance on wifi in CC compared to AA. Ex: Macbook (2008) using ubuntu 14.10 kernel 3.16, testmy.net on 5GHz wifi an average of 163.2 mbps while a 2010 imac connected via wifi running 10.10.1 has an average of 74.8 mbps. Both are next to my router. Wire performance is comparable amongst all os. Maybe is the drivers or maybe is a new way CC might be dealing with connections? Maybe the Marvell driver is a bit unstable? Personally i dont know, but i will have to flash AA until wifi works on my Macbook under OS X since linux kills the battery on my macbook. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p>									</div>
