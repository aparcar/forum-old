					<p>Hey folks.</p><p>After two days of troubleshooting I decided I need help because I am not making progress anymore.</p><p><strong>Goal</strong></p><p>Classic eduroam situation, eduroam wlan available and I want to create my own local subnet in which I can connect ethernet devices to the internet/eduroam wlan.</p><p>wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedclient#usingmasquerade</p><p>I set it up, configured everything and then it worked. I created a backup tar via luci to be able to restore it to this state. This was in March 2016.</p><p>Fastforward to 2017. I didnt use the setup for 2 months, the router was powered of during this time. Needed to use the setup again, so I started the router again. Setup doesnt work anymore. After rebulding everything from scratch I am stuck with this problem:</p><p><strong>Logs</strong></p><p>logread:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 kern.info kernel: [ 1379.260000] wlan1: authenticate with mac_of_eduroam_ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 kern.info kernel: [ 1379.280000] wlan1: send auth to mac_of_eduroam_ap (try 1/3)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 kern.info kernel: [ 1379.290000] wlan1: authenticated<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 kern.info kernel: [ 1379.300000] wlan1: associate with mac_of_eduroam_ap (try 1/3)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Network device &#039;wlan1&#039; link is up<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; has link connectivity <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; is setting up now<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 kern.info kernel: [ 1379.310000] wlan1: RX AssocResp from mac_of_eduroam_ap (capab=0x431 status=0 aid=2)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 kern.info kernel: [ 1379.320000] wlan1: associated<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 daemon.notice netifd: wan (1458): udhcpc (v1.23.2) started<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:35 2017 daemon.notice netifd: wan (1458): Sending discover...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:38 2017 daemon.notice netifd: wan (1458): Sending discover...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:41 2017 daemon.notice netifd: wan (1458): Sending discover...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:41 2017 kern.info kernel: [ 1385.470000] wlan1: deauthenticating from mac_of_eduroam_ap by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:41 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Network device &#039;wlan1&#039; link is down<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:41 2017 daemon.notice netifd: Interface &#039;wan&#039; has link connectivity loss<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mon Jan 30 20:46:41 2017 daemon.notice netifd: wan (1458): Received SIGTERM</p></blockquote></div><p>iw event:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>wlan1 (phy #1): scan started<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): scan finished: 2412 2417 2422 2427 2432 2437 2442 2447 2452 2457 2462 2467 2472, &quot;eduroam&quot; &quot;&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1: new station mac_of_eduroam_ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): auth mac_of_eduroam_ap -&gt; mac_of_my_router status: 0: Successful<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): assoc mac_of_eduroam_ap -&gt; mac_of_my_router status: 0: Successful<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): connected to mac_of_eduroam_ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1: del station mac_of_eduroam_ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): deauth mac_of_my_router -&gt; mac_of_eduroam_ap reason 3: Deauthenticated because sending station is leaving (or has left) the IBSS or ESS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): disconnected (local request)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): scan started<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; wlan1 (phy #1): scan finished: 2412 2417 2422 2427 2432 2437 2442 2447 2452 2457 2462 2467 2472, &quot;eduroam&quot; &quot;&quot;</p></blockquote></div><p>log messages inside wpa_cli:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&lt;3&gt;SME: Trying to authenticate with mac_of_eduroam_ap (SSID=&#039;eduroam&#039; freq=2437 MHz)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;Trying to associate with mac_of_eduroam_ap (SSID=&#039;eduroam&#039; freq=2437 MHz)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;Associated with mac_of_eduroam_ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-EAP-STARTED EAP authentication started<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-EAP-STATUS status=&#039;started&#039; parameter=&#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-EAP-PROPOSED-METHOD vendor=0 method=21<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-EAP-STATUS status=&#039;accept proposed method&#039; parameter=&#039;TTLS&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-EAP-METHOD EAP vendor 0 method 21 (TTLS) selected<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-EAP-STATUS status=&#039;completion&#039; parameter=&#039;failure&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-EAP-FAILURE EAP authentication failed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;Authentication with mac_of_eduroam_ap timed out.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-DISCONNECTED bssid=mac_of_eduroam_ap reason=3 locally_generated=1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-SSID-TEMP-DISABLED id=0 ssid=&quot;eduroam&quot; auth_failures=2 duration=23 reason=AUTH_FAILED</p></blockquote></div><p>tcpdump (in wireshark):<br />Tp-LinkT = my router<br />0a:27:22 = eduroam AP</p><p>u.nya.is/zexbtf.png<br /><em><br />^Not able to link/embed the image, thanks to forum restrictions (for new accounts probably).</em></p><p>Config file:</p><p>wpa_suppliant.conf:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>network={

					<p>Okay, look. After you started posting here ... I kinda got interested again in making this work.</p><p>Flashed LEDE 17.01 on my router, removed the wpad-mini package and replaced it with wpad and wpa-cli.

    option anonymous_identity &#039;anonymous@domain.tld&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The auto-generated config file which the wpa_supplicant uses now looks like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>country=US
