					<p>I have a DIR-825 which I&#039;m trying to configure as a kind of dumb AP. A router with DHCP is connected to the WAN port with address 192.168.0.1, and the DIR-825 has static address 192.168.0.2. Wifi works and gets ip addresses from the router on the WAN, so does anything connected to the LAN ethernet ports. I can easily access LuCI/ssh by going to 192.168.0.2.</p><p>When I try to update packages though, it fails. I can ping LAN addresses except for 192.168.0.1, for which the packets get lost. Trying to ping 8.8.8.8 gives me &quot;ping: sendto: Network is unreachable&quot;.

Hence, you get the error &quot;Network is unreachable&quot;.</p><p>From the perspective of the routing table, you are missing an entry such as the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@Openwrt: # route -n

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask       Flags Metric Ref  Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0       UG    0      0    0   br-lan</code></pre></div><p><strong>FIRST</strong> fix the broadcast address from the interface definition, as suggested by the other posters. Then issue &#039;/etc/init.d/network restart&#039; to apply the changes, and use &#039;route -n&#039; to get the new routing table. Check if the &#039;0.0.0.0&#039; or &#039;default&#039; destination has now appeared into the routing table.</p><p><strong>IF</strong> you still do not have the default route after the changes above, try adding the following rule to your &#039;/etc/config/network&#039; file, below the interface definition:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;route&#039; &#039;lan_default_gateway&#039;
        option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
        option &#039;target&#039; &#039;0.0.0.0&#039;
        option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;0.0.0.0&#039;
        option &#039;metric&#039; &#039;0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Note that this relies that the &#039;gateway&#039; option is set on the interface. According to the config you posted, you already have this.</p><p>After adding this rule, issue &#039;/etc/init.d/network restart&#039; and check &#039;route -n&#039; again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Antek</strong> on 3 Jun 2017, 17:35)</p>
