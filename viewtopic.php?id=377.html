					<p>what you mean with unlocked? I have one on my desk and it was not locked somehow. WRT54GP2 is marwell based chipset not broadcom and is very hard to port openwrt on this.

					<p>i live in europe, and got WRT54GP2-EU version. This was a only option in store, so i think the locked versions and these &quot;beware warnings&quot; is for US market only.

Online, I&#039;ve now found also some offers for unlocked WRT54GP2, but at higher prices (~USD 170 rather that ~USD 120). See e.g. <a href="http://www.techtopia.com.au/product_info.php/products_id/1090">http://www.techtopia.com.au/product_inf … ts_id/1090</a> . And There appear to be two versions, one with one antenna and another with two. Do the use the same circuit or are they different in other aspects?&nbsp; </p><p>By the way, how does your unit perform? Some reviews (e.g. <a href="http://mg.to/2005/01/08/vonage-si-wrt54gp2-no">http://mg.to/2005/01/08/vonage-si-wrt54gp2-no</a> ) mentioned noise and other problems in some units.</p><p>Enzo</p>									</div>

					<p>I dont know. In my unit back side is simple no room for another antenna. All place is full of various plugs, space between them is around 10mm. In pcb is also no sign of another antenna, no antenna switch (like in WRT54G), no solder points, no plugs. In Linksys web i also can&#039;t find that two-antenna version. I think $170 is very expensive, i got unlocked version for approx. $115 from local computer store.<br />I have no problems with my unit. Works wery well with Asterisk.</p>									</div>
