					<p>So I bought an Apple Airport Express (2nd gen) the other day, and decided I wanted to tinker with it.&nbsp; Well the first thing I found were the UART pads, and soldered up some jumper wire to connect up a FTDI chip to the jumper wires.&nbsp; Then,&nbsp; I decided to record the entire boot process which can be found here, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IY1mX3HqXQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IY1mX3HqXQ</a></p><p>Does anyone here know how I could dump the current bootloader of the device?</p><p>Also, I take it I could load up a tftp server on my computer and see if I could reflash the device with openWRT, but I feel that would brick the device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nice,</p><p>I&#039;d suggest you record a text boot log with the serial console, and post it so it can be dissected.<br />It looks like the bootloader can be identified, maybe even the kernel (I&#039;ve not read too carefully<br />the video, but there&#039;s definitely some info available in there.</p><p>You should (if wiki admins accept) create a ToH page about it, explaining where the uart pins<br />are located, what settings you used to get output, etc...</p><p>In short, describe what you did so that it&#039;s not lost and other people can start from there...</p>									</div>
