					<p>This announcement indicates that 2.6 should work on my WL-500gp, but it doesn&#039;t really work. The AP comes up, and I can connect to it, but after a bit of traffic goes though, I lose the association and cannot re-associate. The rest of the router is perfectly fine.<br />Am I experiencing an isolated issue? Or should I not be using 2.6 on this router?</p>									</div>

I have tried different kernel and compat-wireless versions, the latest is kernel 2.6.27.4 + compat-wireless-2008-11-03 + hostapd 0.6.5 (hostapd has to be upgraded for compat-wireless-2008-11-03 to work). Wireless transfer speeds are ok (~2200 Kb/sec, AP mode with WPA2 encryption) and it does not drop wireless connections (that often, it seems to be stable for days). Unfortunately another - rather annoying - problem has appeared: when connecting directly to the router using wireless, ssh (and samba) seem to freeze after a short time (connection to the internet in the same time is fine). If I connect to a desktop computer first (using wireless, through the router) and then connect to the router from that computer with ssh, it works fine (it is a bit mysterious to me).<br /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Some comments to the developers:</p><p>- There is an image for BR-6104K and BR-6104KP, the KP suggests usb support, but there is none, maybe nice to add this.<br />- Both images BR-6104K and BR-6104KP are to big. (1.9M) you cant save any changes, add or remove anything, because there are to <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;few erase blocks. Maybe it&#039;s better remove some options (i.e. netfilter&nbsp; modules) and let the user install them if needed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Also you may create an option to create a small base system with usb support and a script that downloads extra modules and packages <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;to usb stick the first time it is booted. This way you make shure you have enough space on the flash chip left for changes and you allow <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the user to enjoy the full possibilitys.</p>									</div>
