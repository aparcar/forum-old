					<p>I have been trying to access my DSL modem (DLink DSL-520B) through Openwrt (BB r38980) running on a Netgear 3700v2. I have two VLANS - DMZ no DHCP 74.116.186.177/28, LAN DHCP 192.168.30.1/27</p><p>The modem is configured in bridge mode, with a local address of 192.168.100.1</p><p>I created a new interface in Openwrt - called &quot;modem&quot;, static, IP 192.168.100.1/30. <br />Added to modem to the Firewall WAN zone (WAN, WAN6, modem).<br />I can ping the modem from openwrt.</p><p>However, when I try to access the modem using a browser (<a href="http://192.168.100.1">http://192.168.100.1</a>) I am presented with the Openwrt login screen.&nbsp; On the off chance that the modem login is being proxied by Openwrt I entered the modem password, which results in an error, entering the Openwrt password gets me to the Openwrt status screen (as I would expect).</p><p>I have tried several different networks for the modem, all them of the 192.168.n.1/30 style, with the same result.&nbsp; I have tried SNAT, static routes, rebooting the router,&nbsp; nothing seems to make any difference. </p><p>What am I doing wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>That&#039;s because you assigned the openwrt router the 102.169.100.1 ip as well, no way you are going to reach the modem.<br />See this post after the edit part in this thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=220670#p220670">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 70#p220670</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 23 Dec 2013, 16:20)</p>

					<p>I do not see much difference between 192.168.100.10/24 and 192.168.100.1/30 in ability to access the modem, other than the fact that the /24 will give me 255 IP addresses, none of which will be used.<br />The gateway will be the same 192.168.100.1, in either case.</p>									</div>

					<p>well now you have set the openwrt router to use 192.168.100.1 (and be accessible on) and the modem is also using 192.168.100.1</p><p>the gateway for your 192.168.30.x segment would be 192.168.30.1 (since that is the router) and that would be used to reach 192.168.100.1</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reXS_e3fTAk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=420">Anyway have fun <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></a></p><p>p.s. also the modem and router should have the same subnet <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 24 Dec 2013, 02:54)</p>
