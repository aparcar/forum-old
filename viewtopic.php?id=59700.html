					<p>I build successfully&nbsp; npm and nodejs for openwrt. Now npm needs for installment of packages the tool make.<br />Is it possible to add &quot;make&quot; from a buildroot to the openwrt host?&nbsp; I installed also gcc with the menuconfig but it comes without make.<br />What I needed is something similar to&nbsp; build-essentials on the openwrt host.</p><p>Is there any knowledge out there? any help is highly appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chrisber</strong> on 17 Sep 2015, 16:09)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I found this thread:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=57170">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=57170</a></p><p>Please read post number 8.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need to cross-compile the toolchain to run on your OpenWRT router.&nbsp; Use the search function to look for forum posts with &quot;native build&quot; or &quot;native toolchain.&quot;&nbsp; There may be better search terms so spend some time and effort on a search.&nbsp; That could be very fruitful.&nbsp; This may be too old to help but for completeness:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4411">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4411</a></p><p>Unless the router is high-powered, building on it will be slow.&nbsp; Since you have to cross-compile the toolchain on a workstation to do this, why not just build the firmware or pacakges or complete system on the workstation?&nbsp; That seems easier than going through an extra, complex, slow step <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>
