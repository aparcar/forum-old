					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am looking to use a captive portal technique that presents a single splash advert page thats locally hosted and nothing further. Used as sort of an advert when out in public for my brand if someone were to connect to my broadcasted network and try and load a page. </p><p>Everything I read explains trying to get dns resolutions for a new ip after the user accepts/pays on the splash page. <br />Id have to imagine that my request might be much more simple than I am trying to make it, if anyone has any insight itd be much appreciated.</p><p>Ideally, i&#039;d like to be broadcasting a network from my macbook via &quot;create network&quot;, however willing to bring a small pocket travel router (preferrably usb powered) if its necessary.</p><p>Any insight would be much appreciated, sort of a n00b here as you can tell</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
