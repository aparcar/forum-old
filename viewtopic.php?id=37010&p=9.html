					<p>@blqs12<br />All I can say is: it worked for me (TL-WR841N v8.2), no problem at all.</p><p>BUT in &quot;Barrier Breaker 35174&quot; linked above by nozombian there is no LuCi (no web interface), so you will need to telnet/ssh to your router and make &quot;kakieto manipulation&quot; with the following commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update
opkg install luci</code></pre></div><p>On the contrary, this version (a little older) has full web interface (LuCi OK) and worked out of the box (immediately):<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-beta2/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … actory.bin</a></p><p>I hope this helps, I don&#039;t think anybody can tell you more than this... you have to decide if you want to take the risk <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your help, nozombian.<br />Yes, I figured out about regdomain myself with a little bit of searching.</p><p>I did select Target=Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx, Subtarget=Generic and Target Profile=TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND. Target Images=squashfs and tar.gz. I have run make several times after manually deleting the bin/ar71xx directory, but I&#039;ve never obtained a -squashfs-image-factory.bin or -squashfs-image-sysupgrade.bin.</p><p>There must be something I&#039;m missing, but I don&#039;t know what...</p><p>Additional notes</p><p>LuCI: I like to have it it, at least while I learn to configure OpenWRT quickly and correctly. I managed to fit it in with opkg, so now it is installed along with the packages included in your Barrier Breaker build (which is what I&#039;m currently running).</p><p>Your Barrier Breaker build has problems on only one of the two identical routers that are running it - it is a minor problem, likely related to the regdomain issue: I can&#039;t select transmit power above 18 dBm (63 mW), no matter which country is selected. The other router gets to 21 dBm. Mysteries...!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bassman</strong> on 31 Jan 2013, 18:54)</p>

					<p>It seems correct. If the files are not created, maybe make exited with some error(s)? You can try to run make V=s to see what exactly went wrong, I got error like insufficient disk space in virtual box, sometimes it was lost internet conenction, sometimes i needed to make clean, make dirclean or make distclean.</p><p>Interesting that you can set different power with same build, but different piece of router. I wasn&#039;t able to get over 18dBm with tplink wr741nd too, for a long time. 27dBm worked for me only with some ancient build and hacked regulatory.bin, which cannot be used in more recent builds, they have probably blocked it somehow.</p>									</div>

					<p>@blqs12<br />And for everyone interested.</p><p><strong>NEW FIRMWARE for TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v8.x</strong></p><p>Here is a new OpenWRT build for TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND v8.2. It works OK. It should work with v8.0 too, because they have the same hardware. Version is trunk r35421 (Barrier Breaker). This build includes LuCI (the web interface).</p><p>If you have the original factory firmware in your router, flash the file with &quot;factory&quot; in the filename. If you already have OpenWRT and only want to update, flash the file with &quot;sysupgrade&quot; in the filename. You can do that from the web interface in both cases.</p><p>Factory: <a href="http://www.fastshare.org/download/openwrt_ar71xx_generic_tl_wr841n_v8_squashfs_factory_bassman_35421.rar">http://www.fastshare.org/download/openw … _35421.rar</a></p><p>Sysupgrade: <a href="http://www.fastshare.org/download/openwrt_ar71xx_generic_tl_wr841n_v8_squashfs_sysupgrade_bassman_35421.rar">http://www.fastshare.org/download/openw … _35421.rar</a></p><p>I hope this helps!</p><p>EDIT: Newer version found here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=196336#p196336">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 36#p196336</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bassman</strong> on 26 Mar 2013, 23:45)</p>

					<p>@nozombian</p><p>I don&#039;t know what my problem with make was, but it gave no errors, exiting happily - but no image files! However, after a make distclean and make download, the build worked. Maybe I should have defined a target before make defconfig. The instructions on the openwrt wiki are not always consistent. It took quite some time to redownload all the toolchain stuff, but now it&#039;s so easy to rebuild! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I included the regdomain hack in my build, but it still doesn&#039;t work as expected. Just the same as before, with two identical TL-WR841N&#039;s acting different. I suspected it was an issue with LuCI, so I edited /etc/config/wireless, but it doesn&#039;t&nbsp; help either. Maybe future releases will address this issue? At the moment it is not a big problem for me, because I have several routers placed around the house, and there&#039;s only a room (mostly unused) where the signal isn&#039;t strong enough. I do hope someone solves the problem though.</p><p>P.S. I wrote a separate, shorter post about the successful build so that more casual users aren&#039;t confused.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bassman</strong> on 1 Feb 2013, 19:47)</p>
