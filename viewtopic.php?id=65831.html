					<p>Hello, </p><p>I just bricked my TP-Link AC1750 (Archer C7 v1.1). When I try to ping it, the data loss is immense, over 85 percent. It seems that it&#039;s in the constant state of rebooting itself, as the lights in the front keep flashing like that. </p><p>I&#039;ve tried the 30/30/30 reset and that has achieved nothing. </p><p>When I try to tftp to the unit, it times out. I would love to smash it into pieces, but that would achieve nothing. </p><p>If anyone could give me a some new ideas on this, I would be most grateful. </p><p>ta, m.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, it won&#039;t solve the problem. The problem is that the packet loss is far too much -- it is at around 85 percent. </p><p>With such a massive amount of packet loss, it is impossible to do a tftp transfer. </p><p>Sadly, the serial method is beyond me -- I would love to learn how to do it, but this&nbsp; would be something for a workshop. </p><p>If any OpenWRT/Lede developers want this bricked router, please let me know. Otherwise, I&#039;ll have to throw it out. </p><p>It&#039;s been a bad weekend -- I&#039;ve bricked two routers and I&#039;m really starting to think the probability of bricking routers is very high now.</p>									</div>
