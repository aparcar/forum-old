					<p>Hello,</p><p>After taking a look at the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39829&amp;p=3">AR9331 datasheet</a> I see that the UART lines (GPIO 9/10) can be reprogrammed to be extra chip selects for the SPI controller. I have an SPI peripheral I would like to connect and the bandwidth required makes bit-banging impractical.</p><p>I see I need to modify some bits in 0x18040028 to disable the UART and enable the extra CS. Also, I need to set the appropriate bit in SPI control register at 0x1F000008 to select my peripheral and deselect the flash.</p><p>My question is, if my process gets pre-empted during a data transfer, I need to make sure the flash is selected again by writing the old value back into 0x1F000008 before something else tries to access the flash and causes a kernel panic. How do I go about doing that?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I am not authoritative on the subject, but you will probably need to be uninterruptible during your SPI transfer, as any interrupt may cause a Flash read access and crash the system, and make these transfers as short as possible, toggling the CS pin accordingly.</p><p>The other way I see is to modify the SPI Flash driver to force reverting to the correct Flash CS before any access.</p><p>But I guess you are pretty much on your own, since the datasheet is only available since last week and nobody is familiar enough with the chip yet...</p>									</div>
