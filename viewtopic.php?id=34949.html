					<p>So basically I flashed the WRT400n backfire jffs2 factory image on the router.&nbsp; The linksys page told me it flashed successfully and was rebooting, and I waited the recommended 5 minutes for it to do its thing. Of course, that screwed up the router and now the power light blinks immediately after plugging it in and doesn&#039;t stop.&nbsp; The router can&#039;t be pinged at any point, so a tftp flashing method doesn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve tried to get it into Openwrt&#039;s failsafe mode but it doesn&#039;t even flinch.&nbsp; The only sign of life I notice is that 6 seconds after powering on the router, the blinking pattern on the power light will kind of be interrupted and then it will continue blinking.</p><p>If recovery involves some JTAG thing then I&#039;m just throwing the router in the trash because I don&#039;t have the security torx drivers or a serial or JTAG cable or the patience to solder pins on the board, and after the time and money to fix it I&#039;ll basically be breaking even so I don&#039;t care, it was $45 on ebay anyway.</p><p>Is there anything else I can do or should I just start ordering a WNDR3700 v2 now?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just want to warn people that you <em><strong>will</strong></em> brick your WRT400N as I just did if you use this firmware:</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-wrt400n-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</code></pre></div><p>I found this from the page devoted to the WRT400N: <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/linksys/linksys_wrt400n_10">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/lin … wrt400n_10</a>.</p><p>I also read through the generic debricking and failsafe pages, tried out what I could without a serial or JTAG connection, and still nothing. I tried pressing the singular front panel button repeatedly for a minute on start, and also the reset button in back too, but there was no change in blink, or was I able to ping the router at 192.168.1.1 with my laptop&#039;s IP set to 192.168.1.2.</p><p>I thought it might be &quot;alive&quot; because the ethernet indicator ports will light up, but I&#039;ve since read that that means nothing.</p><p>Guess I have a brick?</p>									</div>
