					<p>Hi I have been using openwrt for a while and I really love to have a flexible router. I would like to do a similar setup for my parents, the price for the Asus WL-500GP has gone up, and the the v1 is hard to come by. </p><p>What would be the best alternative for a router. I would like to have 16 or 32 MB memory and at least one usb port. <br />I am thinking of a Fonera2, do you have good experience of running openwrt 8.09.1 on it ? Is it hard to install openwrt on it ?</p><p>Best Regards<br />Selepo2</p>									</div>

					<p>Lurk around on e-bay for an old WiFi router with 8/32MB of flash/RAM supported by OpenWRT, i.e. Netgear WGT634U, for $30 or less. I deally, I would like to get a Linksys WRTU54G-TM with 8/64MB of Flash/RAM auctioned on <a href="http://www.cowboom.com/auction/index.cfm?p=4&amp;catid=61825&amp;catlvl=4">CowBoom</a> for less than $10; however, be ware that this device isn&#039;t yet supported by OpenWRT.</p>									</div>

					<p>The Asus WL-500W is a 500gP with a Broadcom 11n mini-pci card. It&#039;s radio isn&#039;t compatible with OpenWrt but you can swap it out with a $59 Sparklan WMIA-199N Atheros 3x3 11n mini-pci card for a very sweet little 802.11n router with USB. The 500W comes with 3 antennas with ufl pigtails ready to connect to the Sparklan card.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robrob</strong> on 5 Jan 2010, 18:08)</p>
