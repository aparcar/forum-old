					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m investigating getting stuck into a Linksys WPS54G, however it has the 88W8510 CPU, 1MB Flash (i know i know...) and 4MB RAM. It does, however have a USB port, so my initial thoughts are to use OpenWRT to install a bootstrapped flash version that will effectively boot the OS from a USB stick. This will give me greater flexibility in upgrading as i assume i&#039;d just need to rewrite the USB drive each time but i&#039;m also a little concerned that 4MB RAM is too little? could i get it to swap to flash to effectively give me more available ram? and... am i nuts for even considering this? :-p</p><p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts,</p><p>cheers, Steve.</p>									</div>
