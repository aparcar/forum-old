					<p>Just moving from Attitude Adjustment to Chaos Calmer and noticed a move from syslogd to logd.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find alot of documentation so hope I am not asking redundant questions:<br />1. I see many posts about limitations in logd buffer size.&nbsp; syslogd looks to be the better tool. why the change?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp; How do I log to file with logd?<br />3. I built an image using busybox logread and logd logread failed to work, said it could not find a buffer?&nbsp; Looks like busybox logread is not compatible with logd?<br />4.&nbsp; is there a way in the make menuconfig to select using syslogd instead of logd?<br />5.&nbsp; I started syslogd logging to a file with logd running and saw that syslogd &quot;took over&quot; the log data.&nbsp; logread still worked but only showed log data up until syslogd was started after which log data went through syslogd to the file I specified.&nbsp; Can I kill logd and simply run syslogd?<br />6.&nbsp; How would I do remote logging with logd?</p><p>Good logging is critical and seems like we took a step backwards in switching from syslogd to logd.</p>									</div>

					<p>logd itself is really small and does not offer any other options than the size of its own internal buffer (default only 16 kB). I have increased the buffer size in my own build to 64 kB.</p><p>Sources for both logd and logread (part of &quot;ubox&quot;) can be found here:<br /><a href="http://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/ubox.git;a=tree;f=log;hb=HEAD">http://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/ubox. â€¦ og;hb=HEAD</a></p><p>You might try the &quot;follow log messages&quot; (= tail) option -f in logread, i.e. &quot;logread -f&quot; and pipe that into the file you want to have as the storage.

					<p>Make sure that you copy the log files to permanent flash instead of using ramdisk like /tmp and /var</p><p>Openwrt tries to avoid writing unnecessarily to flash (in order to avoid flash wear), so all logs etc. are usually only in RAM. If you use logrotate or something similar, make sure that it copies the files to actual flash/HDD/whatever.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 7 Nov 2016, 13:23)</p>
