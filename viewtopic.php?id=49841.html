					<p>I&#039;ve been working on building OpenWRT images with a full feature set for various routers, based on the target ar71xx</p><p>The details!</p><p>These images contain the following support pre-built in:</p><p>*&nbsp; IPv6 native dual stack<br />*&nbsp; IPv6 tunnel services (for those of you who want IPv6 but your ISP does not support it yet)<br />*&nbsp; Web UI support (both HTTP &amp; HTTPS)<br />*&nbsp; Devices on network scan features<br />*&nbsp; Some Real Time Graphs (default OpenWRT graphs)<br />*&nbsp; CLI has iftop for real time connection &amp; bandwidth monitoring<br />*&nbsp; NTP client &amp; server for time syncing<br />*&nbsp; Custom commands option in Web UI (i.e. CLI custom commands)<br />*&nbsp; Printer support (to share out a printer on your LAN)<br />*&nbsp; Dynamic DNS support<br />*&nbsp; UPnP support<br />*&nbsp; USB HDD support &amp; support for NTFS file systems<br />*&nbsp; Multiwan support (i.e. for dual WAN setups)<br />*&nbsp; Radvd (for IPv6 advertisement stuffs)<br />*&nbsp; QoS &amp; Wondershaper, P2P blocking to better manage traffic<br />*&nbsp; Diagnostics (Ping, traceroute)<br />*&nbsp; Support for 3G USB dongles, primarily Option, Sierra Wireless, Huawei &amp; Qualcomm based dongles, you can configure these via the CLI or web ui.<br />*&nbsp; OpenVPN support (now with Web UI config page too)<br />*&nbsp; Strongswan support for IPSEC tunnels (CLI only no Web UI)<br />*&nbsp; ip6tables (for firewalling IPv6 traffic) in addition to the normal iptables</p><p>Appreciate anyone who tries out the built images that can provide feedback on how they went.</p><p>The idea is to provide as full a feature packed image as possible, with the focus being on ensuring IPv6 is supported as much as possible both natively and via tunnel services, therefore simplifying things for the less experienced among us to be able to take full advantage of OpenWRT and get onto IPv6. Note that I am not modifying the code provided by OpenWRT just adding all the necessary bits &amp; compiling them into images for all to benefit.</p><p>Happy days hopefully for us all! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Except where specified, the factory images can be used to flash your router with OpenWRT directly from the manufacturers firmware. The sysupgrade images are to be used for upgrading an existing OpenWRT install (whether that be a firmware image I provide or the official OpenWRT builds, it will work)</p><p>This list now covers 18 router models/versions. The images support native IPv6 (as offered by some ISP&#039;s) or IPv6 tunneling services.</p><p>D-Link</p><p>dir-505-a1<br /><a

					<p>Actually that is the same as us here in Australia.&nbsp; However you should always use PPPoE when you are behind a modem in bridge...you may need to change the bridge setup in your modem from LLC/SNAP to VC-MUX to get it working if your ISP is fussy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AdamK</strong> on 19 Apr 2014, 04:24)</p>

					<p>I have a modem that connects with my ISP (a D-LINK DSL-320B). The modem can connect using either PPPoE / PPPoA, dynamic IP, static IP or in bridge mode. Bridge mode is advantageous, as it removes an unnecessary layer from the connection. The modem is currently set up to connect using PPPoA. I currently connect to the modem through the router&#039;s WAN port using an ordinary ethernet connection. If my ISP were to offer PPPoE, I could connect using the modem&#039;s bridge mode and openWrt&#039;s installed PPPoE module (pppoe-mod-ppp). But I need pppoa-mod-ppp, which is in the repositories, but won&#039;t install. The pppoa-mod-ppp would then use the bridged modem to establish a connection with the ISP. I think the handshakes between pppoa and pppoe differ, which is why there are separate modules in the repository. I tried bridge-mode connecting using the pppoe-module, but that didn&#039;t work.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>AdamK wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I&#039;ll try compile a new image with pppoa built in just to cover all bases.&nbsp; Heck I may try that myself; PPPoA does provide fewer overheads and thus more throughput for your sync speed....</p></blockquote></div><p>Admittedly, apart from the missing pppoa-module everything is working beautifully now - openWrt rocks. You are probably better off directing your efforts towards more rewarding endeavours.. (the ability to install upgraded openwrt images via the web interface instead of the tftp -&gt; original firmware route would be neat <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> )<br />___</p><p>Edit.. actually, the stupid D-Link modem would really be better off in bridged mode. The blasted thing&#039;s firewall / security and routing / port forwarding abilities leave a lot to be desired, and the less of it that is exposed to the world, the better.<br />___</p><p>Edit2:&nbsp; I got bridge mode working! Using the pppoe module. :red face: - Sorry for sending anybody off on a wild goose chase, I don&#039;t know what I did wrong the first time.. I probably didn&#039;t notice that I hadn&#039;t assigned a physical interface to the pppoe wan connection, or something similiar. Thanks especially to AdamK for advice offline. I did actually install the kmod-pppoa and ppp-mod-pppoa using --force-depend, but they don&#039;t seem to tie to any interface without even offering an option, and they aren&#039;t needed anyway. </p><p>c.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cold</strong> on 20 Apr 2014, 02:46)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve put up Barrier Breaker revision 40540 on the site.</p><p><a href="http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/OpenWRT/Barrier-Breaker-r40540/">http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/ … er-r40540/</a></p><p>With this build, for the WNDR3700v4 and WNDR4300 NAND images, I have included the UBI features, which hopefully will lead us towards eventually getting sysupgrade images <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>For the generic images, these are precisely the same as what I have built for the WNDR3700v4 &amp; WNDR4300, just without the UBI tools.</p><p>I have also corrected an issue with OpenVPN with these images as well.</p><p>For those of you less fortunate and owning an older router, fear less!&nbsp; I have built some Backfire images as well for routers based on Broadcom, using Linux kernel 2.4.&nbsp; The routers include the faithful trusty WRT54G&#039;s</p><p><a href="http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/OpenWRT/Backfire-r40537/">http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/ … re-r40537/</a></p><p>I am testing the Backfire images with a WRT54GL v1.1 and so far all is in order, tho please be aware that since I had to limit the firmware image size to &lt; 4MB that features are limited.&nbsp; However some key features are there, Wondershaper, UPnP, Dynamic DNS, time sync are all there.</p><p>Both image sets support IPv6 native dual stack or via ipv6 over ipv4 tunnels.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m running your r40540 build on my 3700v4 and I&#039;m getting as much speed as my ISP can deliver on both wifi and ethernet.</p><p>Thanks very much for the builds, by the way.

I doubt it&#039;s image size related issue but I could be wrong, not sure if it has something to do with the router hardware NAT feature. So far none of the firmware build support this feature and connection speed degrade somewhat when running on non-stock firmware.</p><p>I&#039;m currently running on Gargoyle 1.6.1 and before that an OpenWrt build by <strong>mk13139</strong> without any speed issue.

					<p>Tried r40560 with default settings and still end up with the same result, ie. slow download/upload speed. Switched over to <strong>mk13139</strong> r40572 build and speed is back to normal. Thus I can only conclude that there is issue at least for the TP-Link TL-WR1043NDv2 running on r40560 and r40659.
