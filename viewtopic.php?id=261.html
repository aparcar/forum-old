					<p>Hi all...</p><p>I&#039;m trying to build openwrt on an amd64-based system running Gentoo.&nbsp; Currently the build fails with a segmentation fault in the mksquashfs call, due to a known bug in the 2.0-alpha version of squashfs.</p><p>Fortunately Gentoo also includes an ebuild of mksquashfs (<a href="http://gentoo-portage.com/browse-program.php?program=7480">squashfs-tools</a>), which is based on squashfs-2.0 (non-alpha) and seems to work fine on amd64 (it was specifically <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=252856">modified to support amd64</a>).</p><p>Armed with this info, I changed make/squashfs.mk to install squashfs-2.0.tar.gz instead of squashfs-2.0-ALPHA.tar.gz, the build works all the way through, and I can mount the resulting root_fs_mipsel with no problems (but please note that I have not yet tried to load the image into my wrt).</p><p>Assuming I can get it to work, what&#039;s the likelihood of OpenWRT moving to squashfs-2.0 as it&#039;s official version?&nbsp; The patch is trivial:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>% cvs diff squashfsroot.mk
