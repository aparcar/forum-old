					<p>Hi,<br />I connected an ssc-32 servomotor controller to the com port of my dear wrt54gl, and set up a wireless connection with my laptop. Then I run a redhat on a vmware and:<br />ssh root@192.168.1.1<br />next I run my motor on zero position of the controller:<br />echo &#039;#0 P1400\n\r&#039; &gt; /dev/tts/0<br />which runs the motor. Finally, a c program sends this serial command to the ssc 32 (fputc). </p><p>What I don&#039;t know and need your help for is that, how can I run this program from the laptop (os: windows xp)? What is the simplest option: a visual c++ program, a php program under browser (without installing apache in the router?), or other options? could you please explain me the mechanism for this task?<br />(I need it to be like clicking on a bottom in windows xp, not using telnet and so on)</p><p>thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arash</strong> on 16 Feb 2009, 00:39)</p>
