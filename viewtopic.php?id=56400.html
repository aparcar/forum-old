					<p>This is perfectly normal. As you are on PON, this is a point-to-multipoint connection. If you wish to communicate with other users on the same pon connection, frames should first be send to the ISP gateway (OLT) and then back again to the subscriber (ONT). All the ip addresses you see on eth1 are the ip addresses from your neighbors, which are on the same pon connection and are only reachable via the mac addresses from the pon gateway (proxy arp).</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Adze</strong> on 22 Mar 2015, 12:20)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>to get closer to this issue:<br />The MAC address d8:67:d9...&nbsp; belongs to Cisco. So it might be equipment of your provider.<br />How is your subnet mask on the wan side?</p>									</div>

					<p>So your subnet is 78.83.96.0 - 78.83.111.255<br />Might be proxy-arp.<br />Question is why there should be traffic between hosts in that subnet.</p><p>Sorry I&#039;ve got no idea to distinguish proxy-arp from arp-poisoning.</p><p>Perhaps one thing: you can try to tcpdump the traffic when optaining your dhcp adress. <br />Shut down and reenable your WAN-IF. Or clear your arp-cache and reset your PON modem.<br />The dhcp offer should contain your isp routers MAC-adress.</p>									</div>
