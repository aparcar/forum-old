					<p>Hi, I&#039;m trying to compile Intel Infrastructure DSP Solution for IXP4XX (<a href="http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/npfamily/dsp/index.htm">http://www.intel.com/design/network/pro … /index.htm</a>) in OpenWRT. The library contains some precompiled binaries. </p><p>The first problem I encountered was that the binaries are linked against glibc, so I am using kamikaze trunk, wich supports specifying different libc&#039;s. I am currently trying with eglibc (supposedly binary compatible wit glibc, but more geared towards embedded systems). I&#039;ve got to the point where everything compiles, but fails to link because the binaries use different EABI versions (Intel binaries&#039; use version 0, while mine use version 4).</p><p>I tried to add -meabi=0 to gcc options as recommended in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=50731#p50731">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 731#p50731</a>, but on the configure stage of eglibc, gcc says it does not recognize that option (and there&#039;s no mention of it on the man page).</p><p>So, my question is... what&#039;s the right way to tell gcc to use a certain EABI version?</p><p>Any help is really appreciated</p>									</div>

					<p>I figured it out.</p><p>First of all, the -meabi option is passed to the assembler, not to gcc (see <a href="http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.19/as/ARM-Options.html#ARM-Options">here</a>).</p><p>But it turns out that the option is not needed actually. When reading <a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/arm-gnu/msg02479.html">this</a>, I realized that Intel binaries where not using EABI at all (and that&#039;s what the linker means by EABI version 0). So, I disabled EABI in Kamikaze (Advanced configuration options-&gt; Toolchain Options-&gt; uncheck Enable EABI support, it&#039;s enabled by default in trunk) and everything is good now.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Nvnyx,</p><p>I am very interesting for IDS working on IXP4xx of Openwrt, do you finished your compiling on Openwrt? if yes, can you please post how you compiling it in Openwrt?</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>I was never able to compile completely. I don&#039;t remember exactly what the problem was (it was a year ago), but after setting the EABI options, the compilation stopped with an error inside the library. As the modules are precompiled, there wasn&#039;t much I could do.</p><p>Have you tried using current trunk?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Nvnyx,</p><p>Thanks for your response. i am newbie in Openwrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />, so, i have no idea how to integrate the IDS package to Openwrt for compiling, but as i am very interesting to compiling it, i will keep try and let you know results, also, do you have some guide for how to put the IDS packages to openwrt for compiling? or could we talking more details through mail, my mail address is li770426 at gmail.com</p><p>Thank you.<br />Li</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>liyuqian</strong> on 3 Nov 2010, 05:17)</p>
