					<p>Hello list!<br />I&#039;ve a basic question regarding packages.</p><p>In </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make menuconfig</code></pre></div><p> I have a package &quot;FOO&quot; set to be compiled as module, i.e. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>PACKAGE_FOO=m</code></pre></div><p>In my understanding, this package is not included in the kernel image but it is compiled, in fact I see a &quot;FOO.ipk&quot; file in the &quot;bin/ARCH/packages&quot; tree. I know that I can install the &quot;FOO.ipk&quot; file by using &quot;opkg&quot;, but I need to copy this file to the board first.</p><p>How can I do that? At the moment I&#039;m using &quot;scp&quot;, but I would like to have it included in the rootfs tarball that is generated by buildroot, in order to have it available as I flash OpenWrt on the board. Is it possible?</p><p>Thank you and kind regards,<br />Giorgio Buffa</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi jow,<br />thank you for your reply.</p><p>I&#039;ve just realized that mine was a silly question: I got confused between what is included in the kernel image and what is included in the rootfs tarball!&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I was trying to compile the package &quot;FOO&quot; as module to reduce the kernel image size. But,<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>PACKAGE_FOO=y</code></pre></div><p>does only affect the size of the rootfs tarball, not the size of the kernel image, right?</p>									</div>
