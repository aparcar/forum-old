					<p>Hello everybody!</p><p>Recently, I needed to configure DHCP relay on several OpenWrt routers. It was necessary for working DHCP server over the IPSEC. </p><p>I have found that dnsmasq has an option for this: —dhcp-relay=&lt;local address&gt;,&lt;server address&gt;[,&lt;interface]. Then I tried to find UCI options for dnsmasq dhcp-relay, but my search has not been successful. <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dhcp</a> and /etc/init.d/dnsmasq didn’t contain information about that.</p><p>I had to write a patch for /etc/init.d/dnsmasq which reads /etc/config/dhcp, and started dnsmasq with dhcp-relay parameter if this option is enabled in config file. </p><p>Is there anyone who else need this feature? Shall I offer this patch to the OpenWrt developers?</p>									</div>

					<p>I am interested in this feature. I&#039;m really surprised to find that I cannot find a DHCP Relay option in OpenWRT. I did notice as well that dnsmasq does have this option, but no way of configuring it with uci.</p>									</div>
