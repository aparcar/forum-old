					<p>so the other day, i flashed a partially downloaded openwrt bin file to my TLMR302 and bricked it. (one of my dumb days) so to recover i went about soldering the 4 pin headers and the 10K resistor. accidentally, i shorted C10 (bottom near headers) and did not notice. when i applied power, Q2 (apparently a PNP HY4C, top near zentel IC) gave up the magic smoke.</p><p>can anyone please please let me know if this stage is recoverable? although it was not my lucky day, i will be able to remove SMD and replace with a alternate. or should i be more carefull next time and get a new 3020?</p><p>thanks<br />kannan</p>									</div>

					<p>I would try with a new transistor, I don&#039;t think that anything else was damaged.<br />Usually the part that burns is the weakest and the rest is fine</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 9 May 2014, 23:14)</p>
