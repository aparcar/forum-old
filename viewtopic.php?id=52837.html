					<p>Hello,<br />I&#039;m using a TL-WR710N.<br />I &quot;upgraded&quot; my OpenWRT installation to a 4GB USB pen drive. It works flawlessly. But I&#039;d really like to transfer all the system to a new drive, a larger USB pen drive or maybe to a real HDD.<br />Question is: how can this be made? I tried with mini Tool Parttion Wizard (every option!), but it would only copy an 1-to-1 partition, i.e. I can&#039;t get a partition wider than the one I&#039;m currently using (4GB).<br />Thanks in advance!<br />Stargate64</p>									</div>
