					<p>I&#039;m currently running TP-Link 1043ND, with 8dBi antennas. I have 2.4GHz band very crowded (I usually see about 20 networks when scanning), but 5Ghz band is entirely unused, I don&#039;t see any stations in this band.</p><p>I want to change my router to some 5ghz router, I considering D-Link DIR-825, it has 8 MB flash, fast CPU, but only two antennas. And as far as I understand there are no high gain antennas sold by D-Link for 5ghz (there are high gain 2.4 GHz antennas, but no 5ghz).</p><p>So I doubt would it be better? The band is unused, but, probably range would be worse because of 2x2 MIMO (vs 3x3) and stock antennas (vs high gain).</p><p>Is there any supported 5ghz router with 3x3 MIMO? Maybe there are some routers which are crafted specially for 5ghz band, having high gain antennas optimized for 5ghz band.</p>									</div>

					<p>DIR825 revB is around 110$ CDN at staples. i have two (sadly ones a revA) and like them very much. very openWRT friendly and with 8GB flash stick in usb port has lots of room. only problem i have with it currently is that although its listed as having 2 identical wireless cards they dont have same capabilities. only one supports 5GHz and one is 2.. so with one is b/g/n i think and other is a/n capable. or maybe im just a nub and cant figure it out. IMHO though by far the best feature is the recovery mode which if you are like me and lay a lot of bricks, comes in VERY handy.</p><p>as a side note im also running on a DIR615 which is a piece of junk unless you fold up the antennas (cause you can&#039;t remove them) and strip it down to be a border firewall.</p><p>to give to a good home i have a WRT55AG which i dont even have the expertise to brick yet, if anyone wants it for dev work its yours, but speak soon because my son could use it even if its stock. i&#039;ve contacted linksys/cisco about getting software for it but they say due to GPL limitation they cannot. #RANT_START# which really seems wrong to me, i thought that was the point of GPL.... my guess is they used some open and some not-so-open sources together and got caught (and hopefully paid a fine) but still cant release anything. who knows.#RANT_END# but its useless to me.</p>									</div>
