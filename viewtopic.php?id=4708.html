					<p>I want to modify some Linux source files under the directory openwrt/build_mipsel/linux/net/sched, and then recompile the kernel to get a new bin file. </p><p>However, after I &quot;make&quot; the openwrt at the root directory, the kernel change I made have not been incorporated into openwrt-xxx-.bin file, because there is almost no difference between old bin file and new bin file. </p><p>My question is that how to compile the OpenWrt kernel, if I want to do some kernel development based on OpenWrt. It seems to me that just type &quot;make&quot; is not enough.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>If you just want to compile new modules or change what is under &quot;openwrt/build_mipsel/linux-2.4-brcm/linux-2.4.30&quot;, you can do that:</p><p>cd openwrt/build_mipsel/linux-2.4-brcm/linux-2.4.30<br />rm .depend .depend_done .modules_done</p><p>Then patch the kernel, run make menuconfig to select new modules etc.<br />When you&#039;re ready, go to openwrt root, and run &quot;make&quot;.</p><p>Find new/changed modules and upload it to your router.</p><p>Sometimes, you&#039;ll have to flash the image (unresolved symbol...); sometimes it won&#039;t help and you&#039;ll have to patch the kernel (still problems with &quot;unresolved symbol...&quot;) - this is where it&#039;s getting hard.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks</p><p>In fact, I am not going to create some new modules. I want to directly modify the kernel source by myself to have a customized Openwrt BIN file. Just type &quot;make&quot; in the linux root does not generate a BIN file that contains my changes.</p><p>let me remove .depend .depend_done .modules_done and do &quot;make&quot; again. Let me see if it works this time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wrtfan</strong> on 10 Mar 2006, 20:13)</p>
