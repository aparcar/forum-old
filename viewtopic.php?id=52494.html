					<p>Dear,</p><p>I started recently playing with openwrt on the router. The idea was to build audio box. Two questions:<br />The version of OpenWRT is 12.09/r36088</p><p>1. The router has two USB ports, what I read is that the one close to the Ethernet port is an USB2.0 and the one on the top is USB1.1. I have sound card on the usb (some cheep one). The card is recognize by the USB1.0 but not by the USB2.0. However my usbstick is recognize by the USB2.0<br />Is it possible to solve it?</p><p>2. Perhaps because of the first issue whenever I play mp3 file or some Internet stream via mpd the sound stutters. Also I noticed that the cpu usage is very high.<br />Does someone have the same problems? Is it possible to use this router to play sound with some reasonable quality? </p><p>I have tested on local mp3 file and the cpu usage was around 28%. The sound was fine. Can it be that because of using wifi (with wpa_supplicant) and because of the audio stream I don&#039;t have enough resources to play smoothly?</p><p>Best, Jakub</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tttx</strong> on 31 Aug 2014, 09:05)</p>
