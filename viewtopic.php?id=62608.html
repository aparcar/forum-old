					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to setup an OpenVPN connection to access my home LAN from the Internet. I have a NETGEAR DGN3500 with Chaos Calmer inside.</p><p>I followed the instructions in the &quot;OpenVPN Setup Guide for Beginners&quot; (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.openvpn</a>) without any success.</p><p>I&#039;m searching for the problem. I made this tests from the Internet:</p><p>- I can ping the public IP of the NETGEAR;<br />- Tryinig NMAP on publicIP:1194 (the standard port, used for my config) the port IS CLOSED.</p><p>I stopped here just wondering: if the port 1194 is closed from the Internet, how can the client reach the server from the Internet? Is it correct? Why is the port closed, even if I followed the &quot;guide&quot; instructions?</p>									</div>

					<p>Is it possible you&#039;ve made a typo in the configuration?<br />If so, openVPN will refuse to start. Are you sure openVPN is running?</p>									</div>

					<p>Be aware there are lots of pages, but I think this is the best one right now on the site.&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/openvpn-streamlined-server-setup">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/open â€¦ rver-setup</a></p><p>If you want real help you need to post your network, firewall and openvpn configs for both server and client.&nbsp; If your client is a PC then the *.opvn file is what you want to include.&nbsp; </p><p>I can not help you with the ports issue.</p>									</div>
