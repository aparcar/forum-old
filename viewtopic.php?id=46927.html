					<p>I have created some webpages , which I need to put in the openwrt (www). I have tested and verified the webpages using ubuntu localhost apache2.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It contains both html and php pages , where php pages are meant to change dynamically( eg: displaying the contents in a csv file which changes dynamically) and also to do some server side processing. <br />&nbsp; when i put these pages in the openwrt www folder and tried to access the pages , It was showing some abnormal behaviour for the .php pages . In firefox , this was coming in a window- &quot;What should Firefox do with this file?&nbsp; &nbsp; Open with :&nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp;Save file&quot; , in a similar way we are downloading something . I tried to install php5, but the system doesnt have enough memory to install all the php modules.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So my question here is , Is there any alternate way for dynamically changing the pages as I am not able to use php??</p>									</div>

					<p>bash/awk/sed ? for loop ? and that error is you need to install/enable php support in apache <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP</a> </p><p>apache is a bit overkill for what you are trying to do.. you couljd just have a cront job to create a dynamic page.. or even just local php via comandline &gt; file IE</p><p>php script.php &gt; ./www/myapp.html</p>									</div>
