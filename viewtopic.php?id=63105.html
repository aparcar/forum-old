					<p>hello,</p><p>OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45) on TP Link WR941ND</p><p>I had a dropbear process listening exclusively on the WAN interface port 443. this results in a dropbear process command line containing explicitly the external IP address assigned by the ISP. When this IP changes the dropbear process continues with the old address which is no longer valid.<br />I guess this is a system bug. normally we should expect that upon such IP changes&nbsp; the dropbear process should be re-launched in the same manner the DDNS client registers a new IP address.</p><p>best regards<br />tkoun</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tkoun</strong> on 3 Mar 2016, 01:32)</p>
