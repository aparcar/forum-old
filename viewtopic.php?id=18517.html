					<p>I have a CentOS box running <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com">rsyslog</a>, setup pretty much according to <a href="http://www.bofh-hunter.com/2007/12/31/centralized-logging-with-centos-and-rsyslog/">this guide</a>.</p><p>Other equipment logs to this server fine, and I wanted to get my WRT54G v1.1 running OpenWrt Kamikaze - With X-Wrt Extensions 7.09 logging to it as well.</p><p>I searched and found a bit of info that didn&#039;t work out:<br />The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-f29e41bdb7bf92b21f05c7c6ad3d96d585ce38ba">FAQ</a> talked about setting NVRAM.<br />The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeHowto#head-9cf33e8a42bd9aed23ee61496bd85707723d6104">How-To</a> also talked about NVRAM (and editing /etc/inittab, /etc/init.d/rcS, etc.)<br />I also found a <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=11912">forum post</a> that described a uci set system.cfg1.log_ip procedure.</p><p>None of these recommendations worked, however.</p><p>Finally, I remembered seeing the set remote logging option on the WebifÂ² Log|Log Settings web page. I entered info in there and finally remote logging worked.</p><p>It seems like the web interface created an /etc/config/syslog file with the following contents:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config syslogd
    option ipaddr    &#039;x.x.x.x&#039;
    option port            &#039;514&#039;
    option file            &#039;/var/log/messages&#039;
    option size            &#039;16&#039;
    option type    &#039;circular&#039;
    option mark    &#039;0&#039;

config klogd
    option conloglevel    &#039;7&#039;

config dmesg
    option buffersize         &#039;16&#039;
    option enable         &#039;=&#039;

config dmesgbackup
    option enabled          &#039;1&#039;
    option file                  &#039;/var/log/dmesg&#039;
    option gzip                  &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>(and of course, after writing the config file, it performed an /etc/init.d/syslog restart )</p><p>Now, the only thing not working as desired is that the entries the router sends to the rsyslog server reference the device by IP address, rather than by hostname as other devices seem to.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeverett</strong> on 20 Jan 2009, 06:33)</p>
