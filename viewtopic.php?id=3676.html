					<p>Would it be possible to configure an OpenWRT device with multiple SSIDs, and associate a different VLAN/DHCP range with each one, and enable WPA separately on each one?</p><p>I see that the ASUS WL-550gE has a &quot;guest&quot; SSID feature in its shipped firmware: see<br /><a href="http://support.asus.com/troubleshooting/troubleshooting_detail.aspx?product=11&amp;no=751&amp;SLanguage=en-us">http://support.asus.com/troubleshooting â€¦ uage=en-us</a></p><p>This looks like what I want. Does anyone here know if the 550gE has additional hardware facilities to enable this feature, or if it&#039;s something which could be done in software on other APs?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Brian.</p>									</div>

The only limitation is that boxes in infrastructure (client/ap) mode can&#039;t participate so it&#039;s not good for public networks unless client is supplied (ala freifunk).</p><p>- DL</p>									</div>

					<p>OK well i need to use my router in client mode to connect to wireless internet, and all my computers are NAT routed behind the router. I didnt know how to broadcast another signal from the router for a local WLAN so I have 1 computer, which is wired to the LAN, create a bridge to an ad-hoc network. After having to set my wireless card to promiscuous mode, everyone is assigned a local IP from the router. I don&#039;t understand it all that well, but I am glad it works. If you know of anything better, or have any other advice, please let me know.</p>									</div>
