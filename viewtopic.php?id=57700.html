					<p>I have 2 OpenWRT Routers, one is my main router and has 6in4 configured and the other is configured to relay to the main router for DHCPv4.</p><p>My issue is that devices behind the second router does not receive IPv6 addresses. I read things about IPv6 relay and have configured on the lan to relay IPv6 DHCP, but this does not work.</p><p>One of the things I am going to try is connecting the second router to the main one via one of the switch ports to see if having it in the WAN port is preventing it from happening.</p><p>The network configuration on my router is as in <a href="http://p.gecko.im/4t">http://p.gecko.im/4t</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Connecting to the router via a switch port works. But would be neat if I could use the WAN port. So this is still open for people to give suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>Firstly, I don&#039;t think you need a static route for 10.0.0.0/24 because your router is already connecting to it.</p><p>Secondly, if you are using 6in4, I think you are having static IPs, so I think point a prefix to your router and assign IP by your router is a better idea.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have 6in4 you usually should be able to get a /48 from your provider, if you add that to the first router, the second router will automatically get a part of that prefix just using the default configuration if you are in routed mode (i.e. wan of 2nd connected to lan of 1st).</p>									</div>
