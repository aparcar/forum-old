					<p>Hi!</p><p>Bought a WRT54GL this weekend and tried differnet firmwares (DD-WRT and OpenWRT)<br />With OpenWRT everything worked just fine execpt fpor the WLAN.<br />My laptop (IBM Thinkpad with WinXP) discover the WLAN but canät connect properly, ut just hangs on Waiting for the network, the same thing with my UTStarCom f1000 SIP-Wifi-phone, it can&#039;t connect either.<br />I&#039;ve tried both with WPA-PSK and withot any encryption but the problem continues.</p><p>With DD-wrt and with Linksys original the WLAN work fine so there har no hardware releted problems.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>									</div>

					<p>Three things...</p><p>1). It should have worked with no encryption but assuming you want at least WPA1 support, install the NAS package.&nbsp; See: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Configuration#head-3df0fd425a927a2d9a7e5c13f070bc4840eb7144">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Con … 4840eb7144</a></p><p>2). I ran into this one - if your key contains several non-alpha/numeric characters (single quote &#039; is one) is won&#039;t set the NVRAM variable correctly from either GUI(web) or nvram set commands.&nbsp; No biggy for me, I limited to alpha/numeric, but someday I&#039;ll need it.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a method to set any character in NVRAM, though (anyone?).</p><p>The PSK is in the variable wl0_wpa_psk.</p><p>3). There&#039;s a huge number of unneeded NVRAM variables, especially when coming from DD-WRT.&nbsp; I suggest: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-71cacf8460752af3f5771d2fae54923ded5beb9c">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Faq#head-71cacf … 3ded5beb9c</a></p><p>Hope this helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 20 Mar 2006, 19:39)</p>

					<p>After lots of work I finally got it to work with my laptop but not with the WiFi-phone.</p><p>I totally missed the fact that NAS had to be installed to get WPA-PSK to function, I thought that is was only necessary if I wanted radius and stuff.</p><p>The reason why I couldn&#039;t connect to it without encryption was probably WinXP-related, if I change encryption method of an AP I have to remove that AP from Prefered networks.</p><p>The F1000 WiFi-phone was only tested with WPA-PSK activated, it still doesn&#039;t work with WPA-PSK so the work continues on this one...</p><p>One strange thing happend, suddenly my network started to appear like a AdHoc-network, not AP-network. If I startet OpenWRT in failsafe-mode it was an AP but not in normal mode. The only solution I found was to do a firstboot and recreate the jffs-partion.</p><br /><p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>									</div>
