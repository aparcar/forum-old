					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need to get third party firmware working on my WNDR3700v4, so I can get a transparent proxy running properly on the network.&nbsp; My internet connection is fiber to the cabinet (FTTC) which uses a modem that I have to connect my router to via the WAN port using PPPoE.&nbsp; I have previously used both DD-WRT and Gargoyle and both have had the same problem - the PPPoE WAN connection is _always_ unstable. It would randomly disconnect then refuse to reconnect for ages and so on; totally unusable.</p><p>Does anyone have a WNDR3700 (v4) running OpenWRT reliably using PPPoE WAN to connect to their modem?&nbsp; If so please could you tell me which build I should try.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
