					<p><span class="bbu"><strong>HOWTO setup Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) with experimental firmware</strong></span></p><p>After I had problems myself setting up WPA I decided to share my experience with it, in writing down this little HOWTO. I hope this helps a bit.</p><p>This was tested on a WRT54GS v1.0 together with an Asus WL500G Deluxe router. Please also read the OpenWrtFaq at [1] and [2].</p><p><span class="bbu">1. Requirements</span><br />- Experimental jffs2 Firmware image (2005.05.25) from [3]. It may also work with squashfs but simpliest is jffs2 because it creates a writable partition on the flash.<br />- download the nas, S41wpa and hotplug files from [4]. Tip: Use wget on the router to download or transfer the files via scp.<br />- you must have a working WDS connection (bridged to br0) between the routers without any encryption (disable WEP)</p><p><span class="bbu">2. Set nvram variables</span><br />Set the following nvram variables:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set wl0_auth_mode=psk
nvram set wl0_mode=ap
nvram set wl0_wpa_psk=&lt;key-passpharse&gt;
nvram set wl0_wpa_gtk_rekey=3600
nvram set wl0_ssid=&lt;your ssid&gt;
nvram set wl0_wep=disabled
nvram set wl0_crypto=aes

nvram commit
reboot</code></pre></div><p><span style="color: #FF0000">Note:</span> wl0_wpa_psk must be a ASCII string &gt;8 and &lt;63 chars, also don&#039;t forget to set the lan_ifname / lan_ifnames if not already done. wl0_crypto is working with aes and tkip but I _never_ get it working with aes+tkip combination.</p><p>Examples for lan_ifname and lan_ifnames (remember the interfaces may be different on your hardware):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set lan_ifname=br0
nvram set lan_ifnames=&quot;vlan0 eth1&quot;

nvram commit
reboot</code></pre></div><p><span class="bbu">3. Files</span><br />copy the following downloaded files, make links and make them executable as shown below<br />- cp S41wpa /etc/init.d/S41wpa ; chmod a+x /etc/init.d/S41wpa<br />- cp nas /usr/sbin/nas ; chmod a+x /usr/sbin/nas<br />- cd /usr/sbin ; ln -s nas nas4not<br />- cp hotplug /sbin/hotplug</p><p><span class="bbu">4. Fire up WPA/nas</span><br />Start nas with /etc/init.d/S41wpa or just reboot. ps ax | grep nas should show a nas process up and runnung.<br />It takes a few secends to exchange the keys. When its up the routers should be pingable again from both sites.</p><p>You need to setup nas with this HOWTO on both routers.</p><p>That&#039;s it.</p><br /><p><span class="bbu">Links:</span><br />[1] <a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtFaq#head-874eb345ed37f58d3ff8445f8adf67c6b52993e2">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtFaq#head-874e â€¦ c6b52993e2</a><br />[2] <a href="http://www.bingner.com/openwrt/wpa.html">http://www.bingner.com/openwrt/wpa.html</a><br />[3] <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/experimental/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/experimental/</a><br />[4] <a href="http://www.bingner.com/openwrt/">http://www.bingner.com/openwrt/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>olli_04</strong> on 14 Jun 2005, 09:26)</p>

					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;m pretty new to Linux and OpenWRT, so hopefully this isn&#039;t too much of a newbie question.</p><p>Anyways, I&#039;ve been fighting to get wireless to work properly on my WRT54G v2.2.

What is wrong is that</p><p>iwconfig eth1</p><p>returns rate of 11Mbps. Also, Windows WZC refuses to associate with the AP. Windows complains that it needs a certificate to authenticate me, and in the wireless settings, 802.1x is checked and greyed out, even though I did not check it when I first configured it.</p><p>I&#039;d be really grateful if anyone can help me out with this.

					<p>Yay, I got it working <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I think I was using a different version of nas which seemed to have -m 4 as radius or something, or maybe it&#039;s the wl0_wep nvram setting. Anyways, how about my 11Mbps problem? The rate clients will connect to it is 11Mbps, and iwconfig eth1 also shows 11Mbps. I tried iwconfig eth1 rate 54, or iwconfig eth1 rate 5 (I read somewhere that is uses some numbering scheme for the TX/RX rate).</p><p>But meanwhile, a big thank you to everyone who helped <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Oh yes, and I am using whiterussian RC1.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi kltye,</p><p>I just did exactly what you&#039;re trying to do yesterday.&nbsp; Since the wireless drivers in the openwrt kernel and the nas binary (with the S41wpa script) use the existing nvram variables, I had no problems because I had it working with the Linksys firmware.</p><p>A good way to find out what the nvram variables are is to install the &quot;HyperWRT&quot; firmware, which is basically the stock firmware with some extra features like a *telnet daemon*.&nbsp; You can configure the settings you want in HyperWRT, log in via telnet and dump the contents of nvram with &quot;nvram show&quot; and just capture the text with your telnet client.&nbsp; You can then install OpenWRT (and the nas binary with the S41wpa script), and it will use the settings you had working in HyperWRT.</p><p>It&#039;s an easy way of getting it to work how you want it by setting it in a GUI, and then reverse-engineering what those settings mean.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kaldek</p>									</div>
