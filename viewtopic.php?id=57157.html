					<p>I&#039;m looking at the platforms page <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms">https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms</a> and I don&#039;t see anything here resembling this CPU, except maybe the bcm2708 in the Raspberry Pi. I see it in the trunk under target/linux, though. Is it missing?</p><p>Also, since devices like the Netgear R8000, and the Linksys EA6300/6400/6700 are based on this platform, does that mean they qualify for the WIP list? <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wip">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wip</a></p><p>I came across all this because I have an EA6400 I&#039;d like to get working with OpenWRT, and I&#039;m just trying to figure out how much still needs to be done. Its main hardware specs are here: <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-features/32089-a-nice-surprise-for-early-linksys-ea6300-buyers">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless … 300-buyers</a> . According to this site <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5925/broadcom-announces-bcm4708x-and-bcm5301x-socs-for-80211ac-routers">http://www.anandtech.com/show/5925/broa … ac-routers</a> , its CPU, the bcm4708, is a bcm53xx type, in spite of its name. Also, does that mean bcm4708 shouldn&#039;t be a tag in the bcm47xx wiki page? <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/soc/soc.broadcom.bcm47xx">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/hardware/so … om.bcm47xx</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ewtoombs</strong> on 4 May 2015, 17:20)</p>

					<p>WZR-1750DHP(D) is in the main ToH, so it&#039;s accounted for. Each in your list that says the target is bcrm47xx is actually wrong, it seems. The Archer C8 is in the possible list. I guess that&#039;s where the EA6300 etc. should be until serious development specifically for it happens.</p>									</div>
