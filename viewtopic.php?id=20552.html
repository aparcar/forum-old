					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to debug a C++ multi-threaded application in Kamikaze 7.09 but so far I cannot get GDB to display information about the threads (except for main). I have copied &quot;libthread_db-0.9.28.so&quot; and created the corresponding sym links in the &quot;/lib&quot; directory and confirmed that without this step, gdbserver complains that it cannot find the thread_db library, so it means it&#039;s loading it.</p><p>I&#039;ve also read that because of a problem with ld for mips, the only way to debug threads is to statically link against pthread, however, when I tried to do that I get a bunch of &quot;undefined reference&quot; errors, particularly symbols from the C++ standard library.</p><p>This is how I&#039;m running gdb and gdbserver:</p><p>Router:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# gdbserver localhost:1234 myapp
Process myapp created; pid = 467
Listening on port 1234</code></pre></div><p>Host:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>agranados@blue:~/OpenWrt-SDK-brcm-2.4-for-Linux-i686/staging_dir_mipsel/bin/mipsel-linux-gdb

I&#039;m not sure whether or not gdb (client) needs to load the thread_db library as well, but if that&#039;s the case, then it will never happen because the code responsible for that is on the file &quot;thread-db.c&quot;.</p><p>Has anyone been able to debug multi-threaded applications in Kamikaze (7.09) using gdb or gdbserver?<br />Any clues or suggestions for me to try?</p><p>Thank you,<br />Adrian</p>									</div>
