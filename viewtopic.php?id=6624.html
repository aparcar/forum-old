					<p>Hi, this is probably a simple question but I don&#039;t seem to be finding anything in the docs...</p><p>I went through the configuration and buildroot procedure for WhiteRussian and my target <br />device is a WGT634U.

					<p>Looks like I missed something big... According to the following post if nothing has changed since then, WhiteRussian isn&#039;t supported on the WGT634U.</p><p><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33&amp;p=9">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33&amp;p=9</a></p><p>Not sure whether I should try again with Kamikaze or maybe OpenWGT? I&#039;m looking for something stable since this will be a production server. I only need a minimal install, just one ethernet+usb+serial console. No need for wireless/wired routing functionality. </p><p>The major attraction is no moving parts (no hard disk, no cooling fans). Looking to build an image that will run for years and years without locking up or requiring a reboot. The unit will be burried in an off-site phone closet...</p><p>Thanks for any info.</p>									</div>

					<p>you need to build a 2.6 kernel / kamikaze in order to boot OpenWrt on your Netgear. If you&#039;ve attached a serial console, i can offer you my prebuilt images and program repository at <a href="http://klasseonline.dyndns.org/index.php?load=openwrt">http://klasseonline.dyndns.org/index.php?load=openwrt</a>.

					<p>Andy,&nbsp; many thanks for the info and the files. It&#039;s good to know that your WGT634U is running well with Kamikaze.</p><p>I&#039;m currently in the process of building Kamikaze - it&#039;s been compiling since yesterday and still going... I do have the serial console working and the login from Yasha. I&#039;ll give the prebuilt images a try if the build doesn&#039;t finish correctly. </p><p>Thanks again,<br />Brian</p>									</div>
