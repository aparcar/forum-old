					<p>hi to everybody, I&#039;m doing my final degree project and&nbsp; I&#039;ve been told to do the next.</p><p>I need to create an automatic WAKE ON LAN, for instance, I do a remote control desktop from PC1 to PC2 in the same net, and if PC2 is asleep, the router has to detect it automatically and wake it up.</p><p>so, I&#039;ve been working in openwrt, I first took a look in arp and iptables package, which was quite big and difficult to understand. I finally changed my mind and installed knockd, which is a kind of firewall that waits for a special sequence of frames and then it does a job told by you.</p><p>I managed to compiled an openwrt with knockd inside and installed on an router, but it didn&#039;t work as expected ..</p><p>to sum up, where do you advice me to take a look and start programming?</p><p>Till now,anybody could help me, I hope this is the right place to post this,</p><p>Thank you very much in advanced and sorry for my english.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have no idea how to do this, but I&#039;m pretty sure that your PC device would need to support wake on lan.&nbsp; I run Macs here, and I know that this feature can be turned on when needed, it is off by default.&nbsp; If your PC doesn&#039;t allow this, I don&#039;t think it will wake up.&nbsp; If it does allow this, I&#039;m not sure that anything special on the router side is needed?</p>									</div>
