The wifi radio will not turn on until it listens, and determines there&#039;s not radar. This process can take up to 5 minutes or more.&nbsp; If it can&#039;t find a clear channel, it will not start, so just beware.</p><p>Bluetooth module is not compiling. I tested it with a fresh .conf and bluetooth failed to compile last nigh... Unknown reason as I haven&#039;t looked into it. </p><p>I&#039;ve found 5Ghz with 80mhz width on Auto works best for me as it will bounce around during the day finding the best frequency - Including DFS frequencies.&nbsp; If you need absolutely no drops, then set the SSID for a particular frequency and don&#039;t select auto.</p><p>2.4Ghz is usually saturated in neighborhoods, so depending on the time of day speeds can be slow.&nbsp; If you&#039;re fortunate enough to be out in the woods away from other homes, the 2.4Ghz spectrum is really good, but must slower than the 5Ghz AC.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks David,</p><p>yes I remember that it was recognized as bluetooth device in the past. Would be cool to have this opportunity to connect as well. I am thinking there more about IoT. I am currently playing a lot with microcontrollers and the wifi setup takes a lot of memory always so I am forced than to use a device with more memory which of course is more expensive.</p><p>However, the radio seems to be stable now with your last public compile! Thanks! ;-)</p><p>I still have trouble with compilation and in hell I don´t find the reason why. randomly packages fails to compile even without touching the defaults. So I gave up this point.</p><p>One of my clients have a huge problem with wifi so I sold him the wrt3200acm and damn, still the same problem. There are a lot of clients in the nieghbourhood but this can not be the reason why the signal strength goes down after 5 meters to almost have without anything in the way!<br />Any Idea why? It is a wooden house by the way, no steel at all. I ordered now a measure device to find out if there are maybe some stringer signals which destroys the wifi signal.<br />The strange thing is that the mobile antenne is in view and the 4g signal is going up and down as well.<br />No high voltage powerline in the near as well.</p><p>Have you heared that there are comming &quot;bad&quot; signals over the usal 230 v power net which affects wifi?</p><p>// Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>finally today it was possible to install in my WRT3200, immediately only the network in 160Ghz did not work, however after setting at 80Ghz and resetting the router everything worked fine.</p><p>As the same is used in a different ISP and with a faster link of 200/100 mbits fiber to performance is higher than the WRT1900, during the week I will be doing bigger tester and finalizing the configuration, I will send the topic informed because it has a high usage of devices on this router I believe it is possible to help David in the tests of his Vs.</p><p>no more would like help or guidance to configure a VPN server, and how incredible it seems the Upnp does not recognize the DVR and printer and central alarm, but that a read in the WIKI should solve.</p><p>Ps.&gt;: I know that this modification should be done in LUCI, but to show the temprations in the overview page would be very paratic, I will do the suggestion in the forum developer, however I believe that if a developer like Davis also suggests have a greater power.</p><p>one more time, congratulations on your hard work</p>									</div>
