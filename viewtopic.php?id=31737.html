					<p>I have worked with the WL520GU on openwrt in the past and I would advise that you look at setting up a usb hub on the usb port. You&#039;re going to need extra memory that could be provided by a usb flash drive. You will have to keep in mind that the usb hub will need to be powered, the 520GU does not provide enough power for a hub to operate reliably. So, once you have that working, and the necessary packages to read/write from a usb flash drive, you can look at getting your webcam working.</p>									</div>
