					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to terminate kernel message printed on console via <strong>CONFIG_CMDLINE=&quot;rootfstype=squashfs,jffs2 noinitrd console=null&quot;</strong> described in this wiki page:&nbsp; <em>wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/terminate.console.on.serial<br /></em> <br />This config is located in target/linux/ar71xx/config-x.x. I change the file, and then use following commands:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make target/linux/clean
make target/linux/prepare
make</code></pre></div><p>But there is no sign of &quot;<strong>console=null</strong>&quot; in build_dir/target-mips_34kc_uClibc-xx/linux-ar71xx_generic/linux-x.x.x/ when I use </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>grep -R &quot;console=null&quot;</code></pre></div><p>The &quot;CONFIG_CMDLINE&quot; entry in <strong>target/linux/ar71xx/config-x.x</strong> is originally without <strong>console=null</strong> and it is just <strong>CONFIG_CMDLINE=&quot;rootfstype=squashfs,jffs2 noinitrd&quot;</strong>. This config (without console=null) is found in several files in the above mentioned build_dir path, like .config, .config.target, ar7_deconfig, but there is no sign of console=null in there. <br />Even when I change those files in build_dir manually and add console=null to them, after compiling it these changes become disappear and there is no sign of console=null again.<br />I have no&nbsp; idea what is going on in here, and it has made me confused. </p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>majid.it</strong> on 29 Oct 2016, 15:10)</p>

					<p>thanks for reply, <br />I tested it but it had no result. When I run make kernel_menuconfig console=null appears in several files in build_dir but after make V=s all become disappeared again and kernel messages will be printed on console after changing firmware, thus I dont know whether the console=null is working or not.</p>									</div>

					<p>I found the problem, there is a &quot;config-default&quot; file in target/linux/ar71xx/generic that the command CONFIG_CMDLINE=&quot;rootfstype=squashfs,jffs2 noinitrd&quot; was written in it. so it replaced it with the everything in config-x.x. I commented that line and every thing goes well but it printed on screen anyway. So, I tried &quot;loglevel=0&quot; instead of &quot;console=null&quot; and it worked!!!!. Although, it prints some safe mode logs on console but it can be removed via commenting echo command in preinit files.</p>									</div>
