					<p>I&#039;ve developed DHCPv6 server/client (dibbler) and it is now part of the OpenWRT. I&#039;ve been using my WRT54GL v1.1 for a long time and did some neat things. But due to non-technical reasons I need to buy new router. <br />I need this new hardware to develop another nice software.</p><p>I&#039;d like to ask for recommendation regarding best hardware. Here are my requirements:</p><p>1. It has to be a router (at least 2 network interfaces)<br />1. The ability to flash bricked router via TFTP or a similar software only method. I build my own firmware often and it breaks occasionally. I don&#039;t want to solder any extra connectors. Something like boot_wait on my old WRT54GL would be perfect.<br />2. Supported (and stable) 802.11 (I would prefer open-source, but closed drivers are ok, too).<br />3. New hardware should be easily accessible in US (something like BestBuy or Fry&#039;s Electronics would be the best).<br />4. Price under $100 would be great, but a bit above is also ok.<br />5. I need kernel 2.6 [forgot to mention this before]</p><p>What would you recommend? Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thomson</strong> on 8 Oct 2009, 11:20)</p>
