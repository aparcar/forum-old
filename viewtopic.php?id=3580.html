					<p>For those of you in the U.S. I happened to notice that Wal-Mart is now carrying the G and GS (at least the local store here has them). They may have carried them before but I never saw one in our local store. They had a pile of them in stock for comparable prices to what you can get on Amazon. ~$50 for the G and ~$70 for the GS. I didn&#039;t look at the serial numbers to know what version they are but if I was in the market for one I would print of the serial number chart and dig through the ones on the shelf. It might give you another buying option in case you are looking for another source.</p>									</div>
