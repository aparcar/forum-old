					<p>After some trial and error and messing with the key on the wireless security, which still happens when making a new network. I&#039;m all up and running with all devices (22 total) of ip camera&#039;s, laptops, tablets, printers, thermostats, smoke/co2 detectors and a guest network to go with it. Kudos for the software, running very nice!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dpdurst</strong> on 6 Jan 2015, 04:13)</p>
