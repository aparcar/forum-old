					<p>Can anyone point me in the direction of the code that controls the supported rates advertised in beacons coming from an openWrt AccessPoint?</p><p>I&#039;m running OpenWRT 8.09 (mac80211). When I capture the beacons coming from my Access Point I can see the list of supported rates.&nbsp; But when I try to change them using the basic_rate option to &#039;wifi-device&#039;, there is no change.&nbsp; The beacons come out with the same list of supported rates. </p><p>I was hoping I could do this by simply changing the configuration but I&#039;m starting to give up on that so now I&#039;m looking to the source code.&nbsp; (of course there must be a way; it&#039;s unthinkable -isn&#039;t it- that it would be impossible to change advertised rates in openWRT ...right?)</p>									</div>
