					<p>Hi,</p><p>I took several attempts to set up IPv6 on my OpenWrt router (TP-Link Archer C7 v2 running Chaos Calmer 15.05) but I cannot get it to work, hence I ask for help here.</p><p>My network layout is this:<br />Cisco Cable Gateway &lt;--&gt; OpenWrt Router (in router mode) &lt;--&gt; LAN and WiFi clients</p><p><em>What I accomplished so far:</em><br />- IPv4 works fine on all devices. The OpenWrt router acts as a DHCP client to the cable gateway and as a DHCP server for a separate subnet for the clients.</p><p>- IPv6 works fine on the OpenWrt Router (configured as a DCHPv6 client), but clients can&#039;t establish IPv6 connections to external servers.</p><p><em>The problems are (as far as I understand or could find out):</em><br />(1) My Cisco cable gateway runs a firmware crippled by the ISP. It&#039;s not possible to set it to bridged mode.<br />(2) The Cisco gateway gets a /56 prefix, however it doesn&#039;t seem to support PD (Prefix Delegation) according to forum entries.<br />So, the OpenWrt router behind the gateway gets a valid IPv6 address and I can ping or trace IPv6 addresses from the OpenWrt router. But the clients attached to the OpenWrt router do not get IPv6 addresses with the same (globally routable) prefix, and they cannot ping external IPv6 addresses. They can however, ping the IPv6 address of the OpenWRT router (but not the cable gateway).</p><p><em>What I do not want:</em><br />I know it would be much easier to get IPv6 and IPv4 working if I set my OpenWrt router as a dumb access point. However, since my ISP has full access to my cable gateway, I would like my OpenWrt to work as my &quot;gatekeeper&quot;, i.e. I definitely want to use the firewall on OpenWrt to ensure the integrity of my home network.</p><p>Nevertheless, I&#039;m sure there are ways to work around my the given boundaries. I&#039;m new to IPv6, so maybe for some here the possible solutions are obvious. But I couldn&#039;t draw the &quot;right&quot; conclusions from the Documentation/Wiki.</p><p><strong>So, please, what options do you see for me to get IPv6 working?</strong></p><p>I have two things in mind:<br />a) Somehow let my cable gateway handle the IPv6 address assignments (like forwarding the address negotiation traffic) while still keep the firewall functionality of OpenWrt to protect my home network.<br />b) Set the OpenWrt router up as a gateway/proxy that masks all clients requests as coming from the OpenWrt router (something like NAT) so all IPv6 traffic is routed through the OpenWrt machine and the clients are actually not reachable from outside. (This would actually be my preferred option, if possible, although I know it&#039;s not ideal to have an additional &quot;translation layer&quot;.)</p><p><em>EDIT:</em> <strong>I found a solution for approach b) with the package kmod-ipt-nat6. See post 6 for full documentation!</strong></p><br /><p>I&#039;d appreaciate any advice you can give me to setup IPv6.</p><p>Thank you and regards,</p><p>Timo</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 2 Nov 2015, 11:18)</p>

					<p>Ok, I tried something else, but without success. Inspired by this old wiki page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/6relayd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/6relayd</a><br />I set ra, ndp and dhcpv6 on the lan interface to &quot;relay&quot; mode. (I know this wiki entry is deprecated and 6relayd isn&#039;t used anymore - I just applied those settings in LUCI without touching the config files manually.) However, that didn&#039;t do anything. In fact, with this configuration ipv6 doesn&#039;t work at all anymore on the clients (whereas before, they could at least ping the OpenWrt router via ipv6, just not external hosts).</p><p>Any ideas?

					<p>Update: <strong>I made some progress - got a working IPv6 connection!</strong></p><p>Inspired by this article [1] I set up NAT for IPv6 by installing the package kmod-ipt-nat6, adding a masquerade rule to ip6tables and a route to enable external requests over my gateway. This way, I managed to get a working IPv6 connection on my desktop computer.</p><p>It has left me with two issues so far - one of which is new:</p><p>a) For now, I only got IPv6 working on my (wired) desktop. My wireless clients can&#039;t connect to external IPv6 hosts yet. I have yet to figure out why that is. One difference I know of is that my desktop client uses a static IPv4 configuration whereas the others do not, but I&#039;m not sure how that would make a difference for the IPv6 setup. I&#039;ll do more testing tonight.</p><p>b) When IPv6 is working, the resolution of local host names configured in the OpenWrt router does not work anymore. I can reach the clients via their IPv4 addresses but typing &quot;openwrt.lan&quot; leads to timeouts. As soon as I disable IPv6, it works fine again.</p><p>If you have some insights, ideas, etc - I&#039;d be happy to hear them <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Timo</p><p>[1] <a href="http://blog.iopsl.com/ipv6-nat-with-openwrt-router/">http://blog.iopsl.com/ipv6-nat-with-openwrt-router/</a></p>									</div>

					<p><strong>Success!</strong> I finally got IPv6 NAT working yesterday. I had a small mistake in my script to set up the NAT masquerading which caused the previous problems. So, I got IPv6 NAT working on all clients now and when this was fixed the problem with resolving local hostnames (like openwrt.lan) was gone, too.</p><p>I will post the full documentation of how I set it up soon (although it&#039;s mostly the same as in the aforementioned and linked blog post). There&#039;s just one small question I&#039;d like to look into first and that is why one of my clients (an Android 5.1 smartphone) seems to prefer IPv4 connections while IPv6 works at the same time (and it can also connect to IPv6 only hosts). All my other clients seem to prefer IPv6.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong><span class="bbu">RESOLUTION</span></strong></p><p>I have it all figured out now. Here&#039;s the documentation how to set up NAT6 or IPv6 NAT on OpenWrt Chaos Calmer:</p><p><em>Prerequesites:</em> This guide assumes that you already have a working IPv6 WAN connection on your OpenWrt router and you want to allow your client devices to use this connection via NAT6.</p><p>1) Install the package <em>kmod-ipt-nat6</em> either via the LuCI interface under &quot;System&quot; -&gt; &quot;Software&quot; or via ssh with the command<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg install kmod-ipt-nat6</code></pre></div><br /><p>2) In the LuCI webinterface go to &quot;Network&quot; -&gt; &quot;Interface&quot;. Change the first letter of the &quot;IPv6 ULA Prefix&quot; from &#039;f&#039; to &#039;d&#039;.<br /><em>Explanation:</em> If you do not do this, IPv6 NAT may still work on some clients, but others will prefer the IPv4 route instead because the default prefix (starting with something like fd25...) does not indicate a globally routed address. Changing this to a global IPv6 address solves this - just make sure it&#039;s an address that is not being used yet (addresses starting with d... are unassigned and therefore safe to use).</p><br /><p>3) On the same page, move up to the &quot;LAN&quot; section and click on &quot;Edit&quot;. There you scoll down to &quot;DHPC Server&quot; and hit the tab &quot;IPv6 Settings&quot;. Then check the box &quot;Always announce default router&quot;.</p><br /><p>4) Make sure that the following values are set (should be by default): &quot;Router Advertisement-Service&quot; and &quot;DHCPv6-Service&quot; should both be set to &quot;server mode&quot;, &quot;NDP-Proxy&quot; to &quot;disabled&quot; and &quot;DHCPv6-Mode&quot; to &quot;stateless + stateful&quot;.<br /><em>Note:</em> The original blog post on which this guide is based on recommends to disable the DHCPv6-Service. But my testing showed that with DHCPv6 disabled, some clients would still prefer IPv4 even though IPv6 worked as well (e.g. my Android smartphone showed this behaviour). Enabling DHCPv6 solved this.</p><br /><p>5) Last but not least, you need a small script to add the actuall IPv6 NAT rule to the firewall and set the default route/gateway. Via ssh create a new file /root/nat6.sh with the following content (using your favorite editor like vi, nano, etc.):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#/bin/ash

# Wait until IPv6 route is up...
line=0
while [ $line -eq 0 ]
do
        sleep 5
        line=`route -A inet6 | grep ::/0 | awk &#039;END{print NR}&#039;`
done

# Add masquerading rule (NAT6) to the firewall
ip6tables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s `uci get network.globals.ula_prefix` -j MASQUERADE

# Set default gateway for requests to global addresses
route -A inet6 add 2000::/3 `route -A inet6 | grep ::/0 | awk &#039;NR==1{print &quot;gw &quot;$2&quot; dev &quot;$7}&#039;`

# Set accept_ra to 2, otherwise temporary addresses won&#039;t work
echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/`route -A inet6 | grep ::/0 | awk &#039;NR==1{print $7}&#039;`/accept_ra

# Use temporary addresses (IPv6 privacy extensions)
echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/`route -A inet6 | grep ::/0 | awk &#039;NR==1{print $7}&#039;`/use_tempaddr</code></pre></div><p><em>Note:</em> If you do not want or cannot use IPv6 privacy extensions on your OpenWrt router, you can remove the last 5 lines (starting from &quot;# Set accept_ra to 2...&quot;) from this script. Then your IPv6 suffix or interface identifier will be static.</p><br /><p>6) Make the script executable by issuing the following command via ssh: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>chmod +x /root/nat6.sh</code></pre></div><br /><p>7) Make the script being executed whenever your router boots. To do this, add the folloing line to /etc/rc.local <em>before</em> the last line that contains &#039;exit 0&#039;: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/root/nat6.sh &amp;</code></pre></div><p>You can do this either via ssh using your preferred editor or via LuCI under &quot;System&quot; -&gt; &quot;Startup&quot; -&gt; &quot;Local Startup&quot;.</p><br /><p>8) Restart your router and verify IPv6 is working on your clients.</p><br /><br /><p><span class="bbu">Credits</span><br />This solution was based on this blog post: <a href="http://blog.iopsl.com/ipv6-nat-with-openwrt-router/">http://blog.iopsl.com/ipv6-nat-with-openwrt-router/</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>silentcreek</strong> on 29 Oct 2015, 13:16)</p>

					<p>One short follow up on this:</p><p>I made one more change to the nat6 script so it won&#039;t loop infinitely, e.g. in case there is a problem with my IPv6 WAN connection.</p><p>Specifically I replaced this code:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Wait until IPv6 route is up...
line=0
while [ $line -eq 0 ]
do
        sleep 5
        line=`route -A inet6 | grep ::/0 | awk &#039;END{print NR}&#039;`
done</code></pre></div><p>with this code:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Wait until IPv6 route is up...
# Don&#039;t loop infinitely, but stop after (delay x limit) seconds
line=0
count=1
delay=5
limit=24
while [ $line -eq 0 ]
do
    if [ $count -gt $limit ]
    then
        exit 1
    fi
    sleep $delay
    count=$((count+1))
    line=`route -A inet6 | grep ::/0 | awk &#039;END{print NR}&#039;`
done</code></pre></div><p>This should help to free CPU resources in case an IPv6 connection can&#039;t be established. My &quot;delay&quot; is 5 seconds because this is the time my router usually takes to get IPv6 up (so the while loop is usually only executed once).</p>									</div>

But it depends on your modem and router setup. If your modem supports prefix delegation, you don&#039;t need NAT. If your modem suports bridging, you don&#039;t need NAT either. Or if you can configure your router (behind the modem) as a dumb access point (without firewall), then you can also avoid NAT. But if you don&#039;t have these options or don&#039;t want to use them, then NAT may be a solution that still let&#039;s you use IPv6 on your subnet.</p>									</div>

					<p>So, one more update to this thread:</p><p>I added a <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6.nat6">wiki page for setting up NAT6</a>. You will find that the wiki entry is much more extensive than the solution provided in this forum topic. </p><p>The most notable changes are:</p><p>1) Instead of adding a custom script that is called by /etc/rc.local during boot, I wrote an init script so we only need to change one file during the setup. The init script can be enabled and disabled just like any other init script (and will also be listed on the web interface).</p><p>2) The init script may look much more complicated, but it basically does the same thing. The increased length comes mostly from the added logging capability (any action or failure of the script can be found in the system logs). But it also does some basic sanity checks to make sure the script doesn&#039;t continue if a returned value is bogus, for example. The script also adds some variables for easy customization.</p><p>3) I added one more step in the setup guide that disables one of the default firewall rules in OpenWrt (Allow-ICMPv6-Forward). This rule is not needed when you use NAT6.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is good that you have something working. It is sad that you had to revert to NAT.

					<p>HI MrGenie,</p><p>Without your ISP supporting PD, you will have to use an &quot;alternative&quot; to use IPv6. To me, IPV6 NAT is the very, very, last alternative I would use. NAT breaks applications, and there are lots of &quot;extra&quot; protocols to deal with NAT. I would hope in an IPv6 world, we can simplify networking.</p><p>It is interesting to hear the European ISP view. I think those are valid concerns, ones which have already been addressed by Stateful Firewalls, and RFC 4941 (IPv6 Temporary addresses which change about every 24 hours). </p><p>Stateful Firewalls block inbound traffic unless there is a rule to allow it (just like IPv4, and mapping ports into your LAN), but allow outbound traffic to flow freely (again, unless there is a rule to block it). Temporary addresses which every OS supports, means a new suffix (or host part of the address) is generated about every 24 hours, and that is used for outbound connections. Therefore, tracking based on IP address should not be a problem. </p><p>Content providers will continue to track via cookies for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Neither v6router or odhcp relay-mode require any fixed addresses. When the ISP changes their prefix, it will be advertised via RA, which will be transmitted into your LAN, and your devices will get a new prefix. All automagically.</p><p>If you want to use DNS on your LAN (a good idea with IPv6), the current best practice is to have your router also advertise a ULA /48 (Unique Local Address, starting with FDxx:), thus giving you static IPv6 addresses inside your network, which you can then place into your local DNS. OpenWRT supports the ULA quite nicely.</p><p>I wouldn&#039;t worry about the IPv6 NAT performance, bur rather about what you are doing to your network (address mangling), and not taking the opportunity to create a simpler network.</p>									</div>
