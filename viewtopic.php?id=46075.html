					<p>Hi</p><p>I have TL-MR3220 v2 with the above Openwrt version. While mostly everything is fine now, I am experiencing random reboots. I have no reboot scheduled. There is nothing in crontab. Is this a known problem? Is there something else besides crontabs that could trigger a reboot?</p><p>I noticed procd opens a node &quot;watchdog&quot;</p><p>lsof | grep dog<br />procd&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; root&nbsp; &nbsp; 3w&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CHR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10,130&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0t0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;79 /watchdog</p><p>(however I have no such file /watchdog). There is /dev/watchdog in the device directory. Would procd trigger random reboots under some circumstances?</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>One idea for you:<br />My router rebooted randomly due to a memory leak in a program. Router ran out of memory and rebooted. That kind of error is hard to notice, as after the reboot there is no trace, as all logs are normally only on ram and disappear during reboot. Developers fixed that leak after I had identified the culprit module (see <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10630#comment:3">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/10630#comment:3</a> onward )</p><p>You might use htop or some other similar tool to monitor the amount of available memory.</p>									</div>
