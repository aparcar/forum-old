					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am running OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-beta on a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr740n">TP-Link TL-WR740N</a> (hardware version 4.23), and I am experiencing odd behavior with my wireless network.</p><p>When my computer is connected wirelessly to my router, and I stream video (from YouTube or TED), then sometimes, my connection freezes/stalls/stops/hangs. That is, my machine is still &quot;connected&quot;, but no packets are sent or received; I cannot ping Google, or the router itself.</p><p>If I command my computer to disconnect from the wireless network and reconnect, everything works fine again (until I start streaming again; then the same thing can happen again).</p><p>Does this problem sound familiar to anyone? How do I fix it?</p><p>All the best,<br />Willard.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>willardthor</strong> on 10 Mar 2013, 23:53)</p>
