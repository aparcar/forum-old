					<p>It&#039;s not clear to me whether the 3G is used by the OpenWRT. If it&#039;s so ...<br />It&#039;s very likely your 3G connection won&#039;t allow for incoming connections.<br />That&#039;s normal for 3G operators. They say it&#039;s for &quot;security reasons&quot;.<br />So, the VPNs should be opened by you towards your party ... unless they are also running over 3G.<br />In this case you need to have an external VPN server allowing for incoming connections from both you and your party and to the magic trick ...<br />That&#039;d be rather complex and expensive.</p><p>Anyway, have you ever thought about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a>?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uqbar</strong> on 30 Jan 2012, 11:48)</p>

					<p>OK, it is much better now :-)</p><p>I guess your problem is that WAN and LAN uses the same network address. You cannot do it. Openwrt would assume that both interfaces, LAN and WAN, shared the same<br />link layer, which does not seems to be the case. When you plug the cable, 3g router will not talk to dsl router. You can ping to prove it. There is no problem with 3g network.</p><p>So, here is what you can try: change the DSL lan to something like 192.168.2.1/24. Alternatively, you could share the LAN between all devices (which will remove a NAT layer). Disable DHCP server (if enabled) on every device but the DSL cable. Connect the DSL-to-openwrt cable to the LAN port (black port) and not to the WAN port (red port in your picture). If you need to use all LAN ports for another usage (like for local PCs), you can convert the WAN port into a LAN port by adding it to br-lan bridge in your OpenWRT router.</p><p>Did it work now?</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, in theory you could use your DSL connection from remote through a 3G connection (if my limited understanding got it right).<br />You open a VPN from your phone to your router, thern use the DSL/VPN server as the default router so packets will appear exiting out of your DSL instead of your 3G phone.<br />This can be done.<br />The point is: why doing it?<br />To hide your mobile IP?<br />Then you don&#039;t need the 3G on the DSL router. You simply open the VPN from your mobile to the DSL itself, then you get out from the DSL, as described.<br />To get more bandwidth? Forget about it. This kind of solutions will narrow the available bandwidth.<br />Finally, if all this is needed for just a few protcols, consider &quot;SSH TCP forwarding&quot; and &quot;SOCKS proxy&quot; features from builtin SSH server (google it for details).</p><p>So, besides the legal implications, I don&#039;t see much use of what you want to do.</p>									</div>
