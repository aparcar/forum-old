					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWrt, I have a Rosewill RNX-N150RT, and I&#039;d like to know a bit more before I break out the soldering iron:</p><p>1) Since this board is effectively a TL-WR741ND, can I add USB to it like in the instructions here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr741nd#usb.host.mod">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ b.host.mod</a></p><p>2) I don&#039;t know if I have room to solder there, so what&#039;s a good way to remove the heatsink from the CPU?&nbsp; It feels like it&#039;s glued on and I don&#039;t want to rip the chip off the board trying to twist it off.</p><p>3) Can I replace the S25FL032P SPI flash chip with a pin compatible 64/128/256mbit one to increase storage space?&nbsp; (I know I&#039;d need to copy the chip contents over with an EPROM burner, but would anything else need to be done software-wise?)</p><p>4) If I do the SD card mod, does it matter which GPIOs I use?&nbsp; Can I use all LEDs, or will data out from the card need to go to something already used as an input (a switch)?</p><p>5) Is there much point in doing a RAM upgrade or is 32MB already a decent amount to work with?</p><p>6) Are there any other usable interfaces on the AR7240 CPU that OpenWRT can get at?&nbsp; (SPI, I2C etc)</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
