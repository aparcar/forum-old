Do you have two separate router devices, both running OpenWRT? If so, are these two routers placed one after another i.e. the Internet-connection of one router goes through the second one, or are they equal in terms, meaning both routers connect to available ports of a third router, through which your traffic goes to the Internet?</p><p>If the routers are chained together, then it might be the firewall rules of the first one that prevent the second one from getting the proper time and date. If they are equal in terms, and the configuration is exactly the same on both routers, then perhaps the other router is just broken?</p>									</div>

					<p>No. Two chips are not connected one after another. They are separately connected to the network as two devices. What I am saying that even though two devices have same configuration, one device is acting different than the other (not getting the exact date and time) .</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m out of ideas then. There might be tools for debugging NTP requests available for OpenWRT, and perhaps you could enable logging on the busybox-ntp program, but I&#039;m unsure how to enable them.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just checked the port traffic on my OpenWRT router, and I can see regular messages through the port 123, and in TCPDUMP they look like the following:</p><p>root@OpenWRT:~# tcpdump -i eth0 &#039;port 123&#039;</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>20:55:39.133082 IP my-router-address.ZZ.ntp &gt; target.server.ZZ.ntp: NTPv4, Client, length 48
20:55:39.158351 IP target.server.ZZ.ntp &gt; my-router-address.ZZ.ntp: NTPv4, Server, length 48</code></pre></div><p>I did a quick test and added an explicit block rule to the iptables input filter chain. After that I ended up seeing only the client-messages, without a corresponding server reply. Not sure if this is what is happening to you, though.</p>									</div>

					<p>It was the same happening here too. Time server messages were filtered out. It worked when filter was disabled.Thank you.</p>									</div>
