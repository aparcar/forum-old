					<p>I basically want to strictly prioritize all traffic from port 80 and 443 to WiFi clients, and everything else(e.g. bittorrent) on the rest of bandwidth.</p><p>I have tried &quot;luci-app-qos&quot; and &quot;luci-app-sqm&quot;, and htb qdisc. All of them does not work well on WiFi, because they have to specify an total uplink bandwidth, but WiFi does not have a fixed bandwidth. And I&#039;m on a very fast Internet connection, so the bottleneck is on router&#039;s WiFi link.</p><p>I also tried WMM, it works on stock firmware by managing DSCP bits. In openwrt, the WMM does not work(might be driver problem?). My device is Linksys WRT1200AC.</p><p>Is there any QoS design for the wireless network?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yydcool</strong> on 22 Jul 2016, 00:37)</p>

That topic is about low speed of WAN, but I have a very fast Internet connection to the router where the WiFi is the bottleneck. So you can not specify a fixed up/down bandwidth on WiFi. And I want to do prioritization, not rate limiting.</p><p>I know rate limiting might work, for example, by setting the wifi bandwidth&lt;5Mbps might work most of the time, but this also give up the potential bandwidth.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yydcool</strong> on 22 Jul 2016, 00:48)</p>
