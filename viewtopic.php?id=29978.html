					<p>Thank you for pointing me in the right direction.</p><p>I&#039;ve heard of openVPN but had absolutely no idea what it was. I did a wiki on OpenVPN and I must say, the wiki on it sucks balls. It gave me no clues as to what openVPN is. In other words, it was not written in a language that my pea brain could understand.</p><p>However, I came across this article that explains OpenVPN wonderfully:</p><p><a href="http://switchvpn.com/pptp-vpn-vs-open-vpn">http://switchvpn.com/pptp-vpn-vs-open-vpn</a></p><p>After reading that article I totally get it. OpenVPN is a protocol, kind of like PPTP.</p><p>So, as to which VPN plan, it should be one that supports the OpenVPN protocol, right?</p><p>Now..., I did skim over the how-to for &quot;OpenVPN on OpenWRT&quot; (Thanks fyi) It seems a bit technical for me. I&#039;m not sure I have enough skills to attempt it however, The linked article above refers to DD-WRT many times. If I&#039;m reading it correctly, DD-WRT supports both PPTP and OpenVPN out of the box?</p><p>No, I&#039;m not trying to plug DD-WRT, I&#039;m just considering my options as my technical skills are limited. I always get the impression that the average OpenWRT forum user is also a computer programmer by profession.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Keypel</strong> on 13 May 2011, 05:00)</p>

					<p>I think you need to make clear what you want to do with this VPN.&nbsp; OpenVPN is an application that uses SSL VPN tunneling capabilities to remotely connect computers and resources.&nbsp; You can use it for free.&nbsp; For example I use OpenVPN on my router and laptop to allow me to connect to my home network and resources whenever I have an internet connection.&nbsp; for free.&nbsp; It just takes time to setup the configuration and get it how you want it, which sometimes is a great amount of time.</p><p>There is a web interface if you install and utilize LuCI.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ccdoggy</strong> on 14 May 2011, 00:02)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the reply. </p><p>&quot;I think you need to make clear what you want to do with this VPN.&quot;<br />VPN for Privacy/Accessing Blocked Sites.</p><p>This should be enough info to get me started. I hope I can get everything installed and configured thru Luci without having to resort to CLI. I&#039;m just not very good when things get to technical.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Keypel</strong> on 14 May 2011, 01:27)</p>
