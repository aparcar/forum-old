					<p>Hi --</p><p>I am trying to configure a WRT54G to act as a plain bridging access point -- no routing, no NAT, no DHCP, just extend my local wired network to wireless using the same subnet.&nbsp; I&#039;ve installed OpenWrt and can talk to the box, but frankly I&#039;m stumped on how to do the config and save it for future use; the proper way to use the nvram is throwing me.&nbsp; Could someone give me some pointers on how to set up this very simple configuration?</p><p>Thanks much!</p><p>John</p>									</div>

					<p>It would be great to have a miniHowTo that details this; I&#039;m trying to do the same (basically, replace an airport and small switch with the WRT54G). I wandered through the HowTo pages and thought I did the right things, but ended up not able to talk to the device at all (could ping on the DHCP address it had fetched, but DHCP requests from machines on the LAN or WIFI ports weren&#039;t honored, couldn&#039;t telnet or ssh into the box). I ended up reloading WhiteRussian rc4 via tftp.</p><p>To be specific, what I&#039;m after is a fairly dumb box that gets its address via DHCP and treats the WIFI and all five ethernet ports as bridged together, and passes DHCP requests through (in fact, it probably shouldn&#039;t do any firewalling). No NAT. </p><p>I&#039;m going to start again and will post exactly what I did. It was hard for me to tell exactly what I could test by ifdown/ifup and what needed a reboot ... </p><p>My current thinking is </p><p>- add the wlan ether port to vlan:</p><p>vlan0ports=&quot;0 1 2 3 4 5*&quot;<br />vlan0hwname=et0</p><p>- turn on dhcp for vlan<br />(edit S05nvram)<br />lan_proto=dhcp</p><p>At this point, I tried </p><p>ifdown lan; ifup lan</p><p>and the device &#039;went away&#039;. The wan port had previously acquired 10.0.100.20 via DHCP, and I could still ping that. But no new DHCP requests had come in, and 192.168.1.1 was no longer reachable. I can associate with the unit via WiFi, but not get an address via DHCP (which should come from the remote DHCP server, not the WRT). Huh? Is there some filter/firewall that needs to be turned off first?</p><p>Rebooting at this point doesn&#039;t help, probably because I changed the lan_proto setting (or because it&#039;s not being turned on by default in the boot script.) The box comes up and gets a single DHCP address, but refuses telnet connections there. Time to reflash...</p><p>OK, I did that. My first step this time was to change /etc/firewall.user to allow telnet and ssh on the WAN port, so I can reconnect. I tried the same steps again, same result (that&#039;s good). I telnet to the WAN port, that works. I say &#039;ifup lan&#039; and get</p><p>root@bosphorus:/# ifup lan<br />cat: /var/run/br0.pid: No such file or directory<br />info, udhcpc (v0.9.9-pre) started<br />debug, Sending discover...<br />kill: 1: Usage: kill [-s sigspec | -signum | -sigspec] [pid | job]... or<br />kill -l [exitstatus]<br />root@bosphorus:/# debug, Sending discover...<br />debug, Sending discover...<br />info, No lease, forking to background.</p><p>So there&#039;s something in the way of the dhcp request getting out. Perhaps because I haven&#039;t turned off the wan? I also tried </p><br /><p>nvram set wan_proto=none<br />nvram set wan_ifname=&quot;&quot;<br />nvram set vlan1ports=&quot;5&quot;<br />ifdown wan; ifup lan; ifup wan</p><p>but get the same. vlan1 has an IP address (same as it had); vlan0 has no IP address.</p><p>My next steps would have been...</p><p>- turn off dnsmasq<br />chmod -x /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq</p><p>Now my understanding gets dicey. Do I need to</p><p>nvram unset wan_proto</p><p>to stop it from trying to get an address twice?</p><p>Do I unser vlan1ports? vlan1hwname?</p><p>Do I</p><p>nvram unset wlan_ifname</p><p>to avoid the firewalling of packets into the device (and turn off NAT)? Or is there a better way to do that?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>(What does &#039;Set wan_ipaddr for management&#039; mean?

					<p>OK, I have it working now, after much trial and error.</p><p>I realized two things: 1) that the firewall was still set up to NAT things from the LAN, so the DHCP would probably never get out correctly and 2) that changing the vlan ports without rebooting required work with robocfg.</p><p>I did </p><p>chmod -x /etc/init.d/S45firewall<br />chmod -x /etc/init.d/S50dnsmasq</p><p>Then I built this script:</p><p>#! /bin/sh&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>nvram set wan_proto=none<br />nvram set wan_ifname=&quot;&quot;<br />nvram set vlan1ports=&quot;5&quot;</p><p>nvram set lan_proto=&quot;dhcp&quot;<br />nvram set vlan0ports=&quot;0 1 2 3 4 5*&quot;<br />nvram set vlan0hwnam=et0</p><p>echo +++bouncing lan</p><p>ifdown lan; ifup lan</p><p>echo +++bounced</p><p>ifconfig</p><p>echo +++taking vlans down</p><p>ifconfig vlan0 down<br />ifconfig vlan1 down</p><p>ifconfig</p><p>robocfg switch disable<br />robocfg vlans enable reset<br />robocfg vlan 0 ports &quot;0 1 2 3 4 5t&quot;<br />robocfg vlan 1 ports &quot;5t&quot;<br />robocfg switch enable<br />robocfg show</p><p>vconfig add eth0 0&nbsp; </p><p>echo +++done with config</p><p>ifconfig</p><p>echo +++bouncing</p><p>ifdown wan; ifup wan<br />ifdown lan; ifup lan</p><p>ifconfig</p><p>and ran it with the output redirected to /robo.out (so when I had to reboot, I could figure out why). <br />Took several iterations to fix some syntax errors. </p><p>Something (I&#039;m guessing ifup) would start S50dnsmasq directly, even with no execute bits, so I renamed it. Probably even better to remove it.</p><p>The &#039;vconfig add&#039; line still gets a complaint (vconfig: socket or ioctl error for add: Invalid argument), though I don&#039;t entirely understand why - eth0 is properly configured. Doesn&#039;t really matter, it was working.</p><p>At that point, I crossed my fingers and </p><p>nvram commit<br />reboot</p><p>and it still seems to work just fine.</p><p>I&#039;ll add this as a miniHowTo - anyone care to comment before I do? Did I miss something?</p>									</div>
