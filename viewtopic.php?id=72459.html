					<p>I&#039;ve been a dd-wrt guy forever but I finally set up a new network based entirely off Open-WRT and I can&#039;t figure out how to simply implement one of the 20 billion adblock lists...?</p><p>What am I missing? The github is plenty active for the source of the &quot;official&quot; adblock app ([lmao this was a link but you&#039;re using a literal 15 year old BB app for your forum that blocks URLs. Cool?])</p><p>Am I to understand that there isn&#039;t a single maintainer of a LuCI package for adblocking? Do I have to SSH into my router every few weeks to update these lists?</p><p>I was told Open-WRT was &quot;miles ahead of dd-wrt&quot; but I&#039;m just not seeing it. Using Bootstrap for a web UI is cool, but how do I get adblocking working? Please advise.</p><p>And if I&#039;m completely off-base or missing this completely please let me know, otherwise I think I&#039;m jut confused...</p>									</div>
