					<p>@david,</p><p>Btw, just for clarity, on your releases webpage, <a href="https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/releases/">https://davidc502sis.dynamic-dns.net/releases/</a>, for Caimen 1200AC, you should put Version 1 or 2, just like for Shleby 1900ACS.&nbsp; Also, I would include the 1200AC at the top of the page for devices recommended to install Kernel 4.9 on.&nbsp; Works perfectly!</p><p>For those that don&#039;t know, the only difference between versions 1 and 2 of caimen and shelby is that version 2 has the power table parameters stored in eeprom and cannot be altered.&nbsp; They flat-out ignore the parameters in the build which is installed.&nbsp; This was done to make the FCC happy, so that people can&#039;t be modifying their routers for example to enable channels 12 and 13, or increase the transmit power, or to disable DFS (radar detection).</p><p>So basically if you have a 1200AC V2, 1900ACS V2, or 3200ACM, you cannot &quot;hack&quot; the power tables.&nbsp; No way around it.</p><p>Edit: So in my opinion, the 1900AC V2 or 1900ACS V1 are the best models.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>starcms</strong> on 28 Apr 2017, 10:41)</p>

WiFi speed of 5Ghz degrades over time, sometimes it shuts down the 5GHz network completely and has to be rebooted, especially after downloading some large files in a row. I don&#039;t see anything in kernel/system logs though... There is almost no interference in the neighborhood right now.</p><p>2.4GHz is totally stable. Same goes for the 1900ACS v1 with kernel 4.9 in general.</p><p>By the way, did not add platform to path but all of my devices can connect just fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>floydburgermcdahm</strong> on 28 Apr 2017, 11:41)</p>
