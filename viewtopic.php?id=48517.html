However I did not see any Kernel drivers for that. (88W8864 has no good search results, Linux Marvell drivers are libertas or mwl8k for example)<br />If its a Broadcom you are in the same situation like before</p><p>Marvell uses a closed firmware (like currently QCA with ath10k).<br />A quick look at Marvell code (libertas, mwl8k) : It seems that it does not supporting all possible mode of operations.<br />Either AP mode seems to be missing or ADHOC/MESH.<br />(Searching for NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC , NL80211_IFTYPE_MESH, NL80211_IFTYPE_AP in the source is possibly a good way to do it)</p>									</div>
