					<p>I am currently trying to port a software package to Kamikaze (7.06 release). From times to times the following error in one of the packages&#039; Makefiles occurs:</p><p>Makefile:101: *** missing separator.&nbsp; Stop.</p><p>What confuses me is that in some cases, the Makefile has not been changed by me, nor did I change any of the include files (I have double-checked it). Also, the Makefile is not the one I am developing, but some legacy ones. The only thing that seems to help in these cases is run a &quot;make clean&quot; ... Do other people have the same problems, and maybe a better solution than to run &quot;make clean&quot;?</p><p>Thanks in advance<br />Kai Koehne</p><p>BTW: My make version is GNU Make 3.80</p>									</div>

					<p>This is usually cased when you need to have a real TAB and not spaces in certain places in your makefile. Check for that... I know some editing programs will *remove* TABs and replace them with spaces, which is not the right thing to do with makefiles.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve run into the same problem today. Make reported missing separator at the last line of the package makefile - i.e. the $(eval $(call BuildPackage,Xxx)). The problem was the one last empty line after it. When removed, everything started to work again.</p>									</div>
