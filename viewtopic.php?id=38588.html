					<p>I bought a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH-R a while ago and running bit-torrent or any other heavy traffic for an hour seemed to kill it and it would have to be restarted. I talked to support and sent it back to them to get another one that did the same thing. I eventually gave up on that one and went back to my WRT54GL.<br />So I have been quite worried about buying a new router.</p><p>Some that I have been looking at are <br />ASUS RT-N66U, RT-AC66U, RT-N16, RT-N56U,<br />D-Link DIR-825, DIR-835,<br />TP-LINK TL-WDR4300.</p><p>The TL-WDR4300 seems nice and seems to be supported. Though it only has 8MB flash which may be enough but more would be better.<br />Also the RT-N66U or RT-AC66U seem nice but don&#039;t seem to be supported yet.</p><p>Features that I&#039;m interested in are gigabit lan, 5GHz support, a usb port or 2 would be nice.</p>									</div>

					<p>When selecting a router, pay some attention to the failsafe methods available and described in wiki. If the router contains a built-in TFTP functionality in the boot process, it is easy to recover from bad flashes or bad firmwares (which you will probably have at some point).</p><p>I have been happy with my WNDR3700(v2) which seems to match your functionality requirements.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, the very old WNDR3700 is based on the very old SoC: Atheros AR7161 rev2 which contains a MIPS 24Kc CPU running at 680MHz.</p><p>The newer TP-Link TL-WDR4300 is based on the SoC: Atheros AR9344 which contains a MIPS 74Kc CPU running at 560MHz.</p><p>I&#039;d go with the newer technology.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the WRT54GL is a &#039;very old SoC&#039;. You may think the WNDR3700 is &#039;old&#039;, but OpenWrt fully supports it. That&#039;s way more important.</p>									</div>

					<p>Since I&#039;m using a WRT54GL currently anything is upgrade, so I&#039;m not greatly concerned about chipsets so long as they are supported.<br />I think I may go for the WNDR3800 as it is identical to the WNDR3700v2 which seems quite popular and well supported.</p><p>As for building my own it sounds like a good idea but what would I need? are there any guides?</p>									</div>
