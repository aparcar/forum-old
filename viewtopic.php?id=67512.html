					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m wanting a good hardware recommendation to get my feet wet, I’m hoping to use/learn openwrt as it seems to be the most open and flexible platform but I am fairly new to this and only have a relatively low level of experience but am very interested and motivated to learn.</p><p>I need:<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Low likely hood of bricking/easy to flash<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Widely used, supported and documented model so I can learn without posting all the time<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Something that will let me install netem package and all dependencies needed to run IP specific delay/packet loss commands (updated tc)</p><p>Preferable:<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Handle 200/20 LAN throughput (WAN not so important)<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Be very stable <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Great QoS (Gaming/P2P streaming/uploading simultaneously) – Gaming is my priority out of these<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; High speeds on OpenVPN</p><p>I can either spend ~£140 on a single router (only if totally stable) or buy a cheap one ~£50 for OpenWRT only and run it from something nice and stable as the main router (thinking AC68U) and run the VPN/QoS from there. </p><p>Anyway recommendations around this would be great and if my aims are a little beyond me then just pointing me where to start would be great! I was looking at the WRT1900ACS/WRT1200AC because I have seen its older version everywhere but have been reading about driver issues?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Dave</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>db233</strong> on 12 Sep 2016, 12:10)</p>

					<p>Any advise on this? Just bought the AC68U for my main wifi so just looking for something cheap but cheerful that I can install modules onto and is fairly easy to flash/hard to brick.. ~£50 budget but dont want memory space issues..</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>well.. i recommend x86 distro.. you load it on hdd/flash.. and can break it as much as you want.. you can use an old pc with 2 cards.. the disadvantage is power requirements &gt;40w</p>									</div>
