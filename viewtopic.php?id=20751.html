					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;d like to attach to a router running OpenWrt two HSPA cards, like the E220. <br />- Is it likely to work at all? (Or even has someone seen somebody who knew a guy who...? :-))<br />- I was looking at the ASUS WL-500GPV2 as possible router for this experiment. There seems to be a hassle with the 2.6 series kernels, and a working 802.11 interface would be nice. Usual dumb question: is there a better choice, e.g. router with USB ports, decent memory, low cost and no hassle...?</p><p>I&#039;d very much appreciate any opinions.</p>									</div>
