					<p>Hi !<br />I want to connect my Wrt54g to 2 different nets<br />my first try was connecting 2nd net to WAN interface.<br />but this interface is NAT&#039;ed so my partner in ther other net cannot connect to my other nets. behind linux PC which is connected to the WRT54G</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.63.x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wired LAN&nbsp; &nbsp; WAN<br />10.11.12.0/24&lt;= Linux PC =&gt; WRT =&gt; WLbridge10.49.199.x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | WiFi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;local clients &amp; WDS to my neighbour<br />to connect to PC&#039;s from 10.11.12.x to 10.49.199.x is no problem because WAN is NAT&#039;ed, but back it does not work. gateway in 10.49.199.x has set route to <br />10.11.12.x with 10.49.199.1 as gateway (IP if WAN interface on WRT) So i think my problem is the NAT on WAN interface.<br />pinging 10.11.12.x from WRT is working =&gt; so my routing should be ok<br />BTW: Is WDS working with openwrt (it&#039;S planned with my neighbour)</p><p>Ciao Gerd</p>									</div>

On that guide the eth1 which on V2 is the wireless IF was originaly down and not UP as i have changed that and it does not reflect the coments...oops</p><p>as far as the rest goes you have to understand the stracture of this device... and i mean you realy have to!<br />I know that on V1.1 the wireless IF is eth2 but forgive me i do not have a diagram of the IF nameings on V1.1 in front of me...<br />On V2 you have<br />eth0 which is your lan to the 5 eth ports to the back<br />eth1 is the wireless IF<br />and Vlan1 is the Internet port<br />Lo is internal</p><p>and if you do a ifconfig on the cli you will see br0 which in fact on V2 with default setting is eth0+eth1 bridged<br />do you start to get my point?? hint Vlan1</p><p>in fact WRT has a 6port managable switch which you can manipulate any way you want through eth0 and with admcfg.. 1 port is reserved 4 are your lan ports and 1 is the INET port</p><p>Apply Vlans on those 5 ports on the back and presto you have a router routing 5 different lans (maybe wireless links with cheap dlink 900+s) and one wireless lan = 5 maybe wireless links with one lan port for lan connection to your servers pcs etc. At a routing speed (trust me this is out of specs) higher than a 1700 series cisco. add a bit of nat and Iptables and there you go you have firewall as well!<br />add bgp and osfp and you get a multirouting cost and hops calculating wireless router and firewall</p><p>Got me now? and what did you pay?? 70 or 80 euros</p><p>Trust me this is working in a box 24/7 on my roof top in a waterproof box for a month now... This is a methode and discovery which is not mine but it now works on over 50 wireless nodes in athens! we can&#039;t be that wrong about this yeaaa???</p>									</div>

					<p>of course i trust you... :-)<br />i did it like you wrote, but i still have in routing an interface which is named br0 and ip address is 192.168.1.1/24 but also my configured vlans with the other IP&#039;s )<br />192.168.1.1 * 255.255.255.0 vlan4<br />192.168.1.1 * 255.255.255.0 br0<br />(with deleting Nvram varibale values i got at least rid of the 2 default gateways<br />for WAN and LAN which i don&#039;t need at the moment)<br />so i took out S41-network and i have a setup which would help me at least to start up: <br />10.49.199.1 * 255.255.255.0 vlan1<br />10.11.12.0 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 br0<br />192.168.1.1 * 255.255.255.0 br0</p><p>but pinging ip address behind wan interface (e.g. my bridge 10.49.199.3) fails (i also deleted SXXfirewall)<br />another questing is dmesg: tells my in the first sector of the boot sequence<br />&quot;firewalling registered&quot; is there a kind of and hardware firewall ?<br />also there are a lot of nvram variables which confusing me:<br />like e.g. lan_ifname lan_ifnames which one is used by openwrt ?</p><p>Ciao Gerd</p>									</div>
