					<p>Hi, I know this issue has been discussed many times. But I still can&#039;t find a solution to my problem.<br />I have a Fonera 2100 with one serial port and want to communicate with a atmega microcontroller.<br />I want to have a 2 way communication: Handy -&gt; Fonera -&gt; Atmega -&gt; Fonera -&gt; Handy</p><p>The problem is that i want to detach the shell from serial port. I have uncommented the line in /etc/inittab : tts/0::askfirst:/bin/ash â€“login.<br />But I still get the message&nbsp; &quot;Please press Enter to activate this console&quot; and all characters from TX are looped thru RX.</p><p>Is it somewhere hardcoded or do I need setserial/stty?</p><p>In one direction it works fine with the command: nc -l -p 3333 &gt; /dev/tts/0 <br />So I can Telnet to the port 3333 and everything gets forwarded to the serial port.</p><p>But how can I read the bytes from /dev/tts/0 and send them back over WIFI?</p><p>Another solution I&#039;ve read would be to make a shell script and execute it with atmega (because shell is activated). But the atmega would get all sended characters back on RX which is not a good solution for me.</p><p>Greetings redreggae</p>									</div>

					<p>ok...I flashed it with the circuitdb firmware where console output is disabled and setserial and stty installed.<br /><a href="http://www.circuitdb.com/articles/11/5">http://www.circuitdb.com/articles/11/5</a></p><p>The only strange thing is in hterm every character from TX comes back to RX. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a hterm local echo problem or a fonera setting.</p>									</div>
