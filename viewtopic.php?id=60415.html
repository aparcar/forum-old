					<p>Hi.</p><p>Just wanted to report that the Belking netcam F7D7601v1 works perfectly with the Wansview NCS601W images (flashed Chaos Calmer and snapshot).<br />When looking for the USB id of the wemcam I found a picture of a pcb on this site: <a href="http://wanda25.de/wansview_ncs601w.html">http://wanda25.de/wansview_ncs601w.html</a> .<br />It looks very similar to the one in the Belkin, and the ram &amp; flash sizes match.</p><p>With the stock firmware you can get root as described over here:<br /><a href="http://sheldor.blogspot.nl/2014/01/openwrt-for-wemo-part-2-flashing.html">http://sheldor.blogspot.nl/2014/01/open â€¦ shing.html</a></p><p>The only snag is that the webcam does not seem to support VIDIOC_S_FMT.<br />But I worked around that for now by piping the output of v4l2-ctl through ssh into vlc on my desktop.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>									</div>
