					<p>* Present: the router is an Asus WL-500gP and is dead: when powered up the 4LAN+WAN leds are on (from the first moment, no blinking) and the rest are off and there is no activity on any eth port - not a single frame (as reported by a direct connected tcpdump/wireshark). can&#039;t say what exactly is the problem but probably the BIOS is broken also.<br />* What happened: I was running whiterussian (kernel 2.4) and everything was fine until I decided to upgrade to kernel 2.6 no matter what the wireless problems are or might be. I downloaded kamikaze 8.09 (kernel 2.6 for brcm47xx: openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx) and installed it on the router through whiterussian webinterface. It worked nice, I logged in with telnet, changed the passwd, &#039;uname&#039; confirmed the kernel 2.6 and then I ssh-ed into it successfully.<br />After 3 min rebooted automatically and after 2 such reboots (at 3-5 minutes) died. So it lived with 2.6 for about 6-8 minutes.<br />I tried restart with the power on pressed many times without success I also tried the pin 9 ground method also without success.<br />Just before each restart I successfully logged into the LuCI web interface; therefore there are big chances that the LuCI interface did something very wrong.<br />Does it worth finding a jtag cable and and try my best to mount it? Will the jtag cable for sure solve the problem?<br />Are there any other solutions (except the ones that I already tried) that I can try before I throw it in a box for the next 10 years hoping in a miracle?</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you try the firmware restoration mode (press restore(?) for a few seconds while connecting to power)? (There is no power-button on the device, as you described)<br />Then the power-led should flash slowly, and you can download a new firmware via tftp or the Asus Utility.<br />If that doesn&#039;t work, the boot loader is probably damaged, or even worse occured.<br />Grounding any pins without proper knowledge of THAT PARTICULAR device is very adventurous, and can be mortal.</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried that too, without success. In order to use the firmware restoration tool you need to have one of the interfaces working (also some LEDs - the power one - should blink) and as I said, I believe the interfaces are dead. I&#039;ll give a try with the serial cable although I&#039;m not very hw oriented but it doesn&#039;t seem complicate; I&#039;d like to avoid this because if it doesn&#039;t work I wold not know if is the cable I just made or the router, but it seems the only solution.<br />I find very strange the way it happened (after a successfully installation): the LuCI interface should be reviewed because this is a very serious bug; anyway, the cause is a default running software after a fresh install.<br />If someone else can confirm the same problem and symptoms, it should go to bug report also.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, this phenomenon - i.e. the adaptor failing somehow - is not unknown to me either. Because of its cheap&amp;crappy fabrication, some capacitors &#039;explode&#039; (&#039;they lift their hat&#039; as a more hardware-oriented colleague of mine pointed it out). The result is an idle voltage of 5V but only 4V under load. I had the capacitors replaced and the adaptor works fine again. Bottom line: always be prepared with extra adaptors (or capacitors) if you use an Asus WL500gP... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>This is exactly what has been occuring with me. <br />I have installed the lastest kamikaze 8.09.1 release on my WL-500g P r1.1. <br />I can telnet and ssh into it but when i change something and issue the reboot command the box, which was working perfectly before, goes incommunicado. <br />I cannot reset it and restart. No amount of button pressing brings it back to life. <br />I have managed to bring it back to life by opening it up shorting pin 9 and waiting till it goes back to life flashing. <br />I am uncertain that the PSU is the fault because the original asus firmware stayed up for hours and rebooted without any problems on the box.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had similar power supply problems. Router was not booting up. Or even if it started successfully, it was losing the packets like crazy.</p><p>It started with boot problems: all LEDs were up and light (maxbe except power LED and WIFI). Sometime it went further and seemed operation but it didn&#039;t respond to ping and did not give any sign of life.<br />Then I started it with another power adaptor, it started successfully. Next day (again with the faulty adaptor) I recognized that Internet is interrupted from time to time (say once in every 2-3 minutes). I was monitoring it with continuos ping.<br />Then I investigated the router from close and discovered that power led blinks once when ping loss happens. Sometimes even all LEDs were light for a short time.<br />I replaced the power adaptor and after that not a single packet loss!</p><p>My lesson from this: faulty power supply can cause weird things...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>markov333</strong> on 19 Oct 2009, 21:42)</p>
