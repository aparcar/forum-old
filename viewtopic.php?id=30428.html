					<p>The commit operation is not superfluous, its needed for programmatic changes to uci files. All &quot;uci set&quot;, &quot;uci add&quot;, &quot;uci rename&quot; and &quot;uci delete&quot; commands are staged in tmp and written to flash at once with &quot;uci commit&quot;.<br />This obviously does not apply to people using text editors, but to scripts, guis and other programs working with uci files.</p>									</div>

For example, the firewall is configured with network interface names (via UCI) instead of physical hardware device names. This allows, for example, for me to add or remove hardware devices (for instance bridging) from an interface, without having to modify anything else on the system... it all works great.</p><p>This also has advantages when you take into account the broad cross-platform nature of OpenWrt. Different boards have different hardware device names, but system services like the firewall don&#039;t really need to care about them. All the configuration is done in /etc/config/network.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aport</strong> on 13 Jun 2011, 20:44)</p>

Especially when managing multiple PPPoE or tunnel links it good to be able to derive the network name from the interface.<br />ppp0 ... ppp9 does not really cut it, and constantly changing interface names are annyoing as well. As far as iptables is concerned, the &quot;ppp+&quot; wildcard syntax still works.</p><p>Oh and to translate network to interface names:</p><p>WAN=$(uci -P/var/state get network.wan.ifname)<br />iptables -I INPUT -i $WAN ...</p>									</div>
