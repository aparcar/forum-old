					<p>Hi, I have a TP-Link TL-WR740N running on OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r36713. While experiencing the odd outage which I can resolve with a reboot, it generally works well. But it looks like, I need to upgrade to a newer version if I wantto install other packages (interested in WOL). Now, which package do I need from h ttps <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />/downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/ar71xx/generic/ ? Or is this the correct location at all? I&#039;m a bit confused as to what I need. Any assistance is welcome</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes that is the correct location.&nbsp; Get the TL-WR740n &quot;sysupgrade&quot; for your hardware version.&nbsp; Hardware version is on the sticker on the bottom of the router.</p><p>That device has only a 4 MB flash chip.&nbsp; If you flash the release build, there is only space to install a few small packages at run-time.&nbsp; You may need to use the Image Builder to make a custom image removing some packages you don&#039;t need and adding the ones that you want.</p>									</div>
