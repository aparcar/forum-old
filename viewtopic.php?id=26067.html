Kludgy but acceptable.</p><p>The same two systems have been upgraded to rc1, same configuration except for opkg.conf pointing to the newer packages. In this case, ping or no ping, after a few minutes the tv will stop playing and go back to the media browser, while the logs of both system will show a topology change in the bridges, resulting in a temporary loss of connectivity and the stopping of the video.</p><p>I am unsure how / what I should report: the situation wasn&#039;t fully working to begin with and the context is not simple.<br />Apart from a dedicated thread (possibly), what else would you suggest? Both systems are fitted with serial console, just in case.</p><p>Andrea.</p><p>EDIT: relevant log lines below (clock not synced):</p><p>Aug 10 10:20:24 router-casa-andrea user.info kernel: br-lan: received tcn bpdu on port 3(wlan0.sta4)<br />Aug 10 10:20:24 router-casa-andrea user.info kernel: br-lan: topology change detected, propagating</p><p>Aug&nbsp; 9 16:42:32 foneratv user.info kernel: br-wan: neighbor 8000.00:17:31:d6:97:7a lost on port 2(ath0)<br />Aug&nbsp; 9 16:42:32 foneratv user.info kernel: br-wan: topology change detected, propagating</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aboaboit</strong> on 14 Aug 2010, 21:50)</p>
