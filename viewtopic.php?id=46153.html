					<p>Good morning everyone!</p><p>I didn&#039;t see the notice on the Table of Hardware that devices that are 16MB or smaller shouldn&#039;t flash with Attitude Adjustment.&nbsp; Well, I did and the router boots but overheats and then freezes.&nbsp; I get about 60 seconds of use so I have the chance to do some operations on it.&nbsp; My thinking is if I can get the available memory low enough to upload Kamikaze, I should be set.</p><p>That being said, what modules can I unload to free up space without bricking the router?</p><p>Or is there a better way to load Kamikaze under my current situation?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Well if your router overheats and freezes I think it is a different problem, and kamikaze will not solve that.<br />On top of that, kamikaze is rather ancient at this point as well</p>									</div>
