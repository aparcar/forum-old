					<p>Hello,</p><p>Maybe that&#039;s just me (most likely...), maybe not...?</p><p>I like to install OpenWRT on a Netgear R6250.<br />So went to the device page <strong>wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/netgear/netgear_r6250 </strong>and under &quot;Firmware OpenWrt Install URL:&quot; it goes to <strong>downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/bcm53xx/generic/openwrt-15.05-bcm53xx-netgear-r6250-squashfs.chk</strong></p><p>Further down under &quot;Conventions per characteristic&quot; there is a link under &quot;Firmware OpenWrt Install&quot; that points to something very different: <strong>downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr4900-v2-squashfs-factory.bin</strong></p><p>I&#039;m first of all confused about the format. A .bin looks more suitable to me.<br />But the .bin file seems to be verision 14.07 whereas the .bin is 15.05.<br />Secondly the other links in the lower category are all referring to DIR-505.</p><p>I&#039;ve just started with OpenWRT and haven&#039;t found any explanation to this. I&#039;m sure there is a reason for all of this but it&#039;s a bit confusing for a newcomer!</p><p>Can anyone give me a hint to the correct installation file and maybe also clarify what the other files are meant to be for?</p><p>Stephan</p><p>PS: No links allowed so could only highlight them.</p>									</div>

					<p>IMHO it is not that hard to recognize that &quot;Conventions per characteristic&quot; is only the explanation for what is expected as values in the dataentry and the information contained in the conventions is not related to the device in the dataentry above. At least when you read in the conventions &quot;Model DIR-509&quot; (which does not fit to any device) and a column called &quot;Example&quot; you should realize this.</p>									</div>

					<p>The stuff at the bottom of the page is just examples for how to write device pages.&nbsp; &nbsp;The .chk file is a standard format for Broadcom routers and their CFE bootloaders.</p>									</div>
