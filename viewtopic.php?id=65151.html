					<p>I&#039;m currently going to be in a tight scenario with internet for about the next 3 weeks because Verizon sucks and can&#039;t install the FiOS ONT in my new place until 3 weeks after I move in! Luckily they gave us a Jetpack to use until we can get the ONT installed, my roommate and I also have rooted Nexus 6s and I&#039;m currently USB tethered to the router, which gives me a steady 35 Mbps up and 22 Mbps down, whereas the jetpack only gives about 15 Mbps up and 2 Mbps down.</p><p>So my question is: can I create a wireless bridge from the jetpack to my router&#039;s AP and have it have kick in when I disable tethering on my phone?</p><p>I&#039;m currently using Arokh&#039;s custom DD build for the Archer C7 V2.</p><p>Edit:</p><p>I believe I have setup the bridge correctly but it doesn&#039;t seem to be working as I can&#039;t ping the clients on each opposing access point.</p><p>I turned my 2.4 GHz radio into a Client using WDS, connected to the Jetpack, and placed it in the LAN firewall zone. I know the connection was successful because it shows up on the jetpack. I then added the Jetpack interface to the LAN bridge brlan. They are both the same subnet and so a IP collision wouldn&#039;t happen I changed the Jetpack&#039;s IP to 192.168.1.3 and rebooted it. </p><p>If I SSH into my router and try to ping 192.168.1.3 I get no response, same thing happens if I try to ping 192.168.1.1 (my router) from a device connected to the Jetpack. I&#039;m going to assume the routes are screwed up and I need to add a static route between the Jetpack and the router&#039;s AP.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brando56894</strong> on 27 May 2016, 23:09)</p>

					<p>If your trying to use the JetPack as WAN for outbound. I would advise having it setup on a different subnet as your LAN subnet. When you connect to it via your router wifi as client.&nbsp; You want to put it into the WAN zone so that packets route out of it&nbsp; correctly.</p><p>In regards to load balance your Nexus6s and the JetPack . You want to to install mwan3 via opkg. You can find more information here <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mwan3">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/mwan3</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Awesome thanks, I&#039;ll give it a go!</p><p>Edit: Using the Jetpack as my WAN connection worked perfectly using your instructions (testing it now from my desktop), thanks!</p><p>Now I just have to setup the load balancing and I&#039;ll be good to go!</p><p>Edit 2: Got it to work, that was pretty simple.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brando56894</strong> on 27 May 2016, 23:08)</p>
