					<p>Hi everyone.<br />This is my first time posting, so apologies if this isn&#039;t the right place to do so (woul&#039;d appreciate getting the right place).<br />I new to OpenWRT.<br />I would appreciate it if you could take a moment of your time to guide and help me learn.<br />I&#039;ll try to make this as efficient as possible.<br />My ISP&#039;s modem doesn&#039;t require any username, password, or configuration on my part. <br />All I need from my router is to manage my network and clients (DHCP). <br />As stated in the topic subject, I flashed OpenWRT on my router.<br />The process was successful. <br />When opening the address on the browser, I set the password and enabled SSH for the LAN interface.<br />After all of this, I can&#039;t access the internet.<br />The actions I have tried and didn&#039;t fix the problem are:<br />- Tried flashing gargoyle&#039;s GUI - Because of the different settings there I thought it would also solve my problem (as it did for others), but it didn&#039;t. <br />What I did notice after flashing gargoyle, is that I don&#039;t get a WAN/ISP IP.<br />- I set the VLAN to eath0 - didn&#039;t help.<br />Any advice or help would be more than welcome.<br />Thank you</p>									</div>
