					<p>Hi all,<br />I have installed a pptpd sever on my router. When I tried to establish a VPN-connection (Windows 8.1) which failed with 619 errors.

You can follow <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages</a> to build your own packages (of course, you should build SDK first <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build).">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build).</a> One thing should be mentioned is that you might be not able to compile a plugin named pptpd-logwtmp.c. That&#039;s okay, just delete this .c file and compile.</p>									</div>

As I said, a plugin need pptp.h, which is not include in openwrt truck. If your device&#039;s architecture is ar71xx, you can use my compiled package. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-ZiI5fp0q-ocEt1RUxxek5Penc">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-ZiI5f â€¦ Uxxek5Penc</a> Or you can follow &#039;how to build a package&#039; to build one by yourself. By the way, it&#039;s recommended to use openvpn. It&#039;s easier to deploy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lartely</strong> on 18 Apr 2014, 06:07)</p>

					<p>Thank you for reply and the package, I&#039;ll try it. I like to compile images myself, because it saves valuable flash space, so I will have to learn something new then.
