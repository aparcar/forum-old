					<p>I couldn&#039;t login via ssh after sysupgrade of OpenWrt. I tried to login with ssh root@192.168.0.10, but immediately after entering the password I got the message</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Connection to 192.168.0.10 closed.</code></pre></div><p>So I ran ssh root@192.168.0.10 -v -v and found out, that the connection had been successfully established and then closed. I didn&#039;t know why that was happening and thought about what changed after sysupgrade. Well all the packages I installed where gone of course. But what missing package would stop me from loging in? Eventually I found out, that it was the <strong>bash</strong>-package. To make bash the default shell for root I had altered the corresponding line in /etc/passwd, which was maintained during upgrade.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash</code></pre></div><p>Now, when I tried to login via ssh OpenWrt tried to open a bash shell, but bash wasn&#039;t there. Therefore connection got closed. To solve this I had to login using the following command:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh -t root@192.168.0.10 ash</code></pre></div><p>This opened a default ash-shell. Now I was able to install the missing bash-package and everything was fine again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chevron</strong> on 19 Apr 2014, 15:52)</p>

					<p>Nice tip! It happened to me some time ago, my fix was a factory reset <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" /><br />I hadn&#039;t time to search the problem...</p>									</div>
