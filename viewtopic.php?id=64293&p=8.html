					<p>I think I have a bad modem, and the cause might be from unstable power at my place. Is there any way I can flash the modem firmware? <br />I bricked this router by flashing the wrong recovery file, but today I managed to unbrick it by using skypro rom flasher. I think the modem can be replaced and i am waiting for another modem brand since I can&#039;t find the correct modem. hopefully it will settle my problem. BTW with original modem I can&#039;t connect to 4G signal even though my phone was able to connect. Hopefully changing the modem will let me connect to 4G with this modded router.</p><p>From serial terminal i get this loop so my router can not start properly, it keeps blinking power Led.</p><p>[initSerialPortFd 83] Fail to open /dev/ttyUSB1!, retry_counter= 12<br />[openSerialPort 125] Fail to open serial port /dev/ttyUSB1!<br />[initSerialPortFd 83] Fail to open /dev/ttyUSB1!, retry_counter= 13<br />[openSerialPort 125] Fail to open serial port /dev/ttyUSB1!<br />[initSerialPortFd 83] Fail to open /dev/ttyUSB1!, retry_counter= 14</p><p>It must be the broken modem. using openwrt/lede firmware, it starts but with no 3g/4g.

I even used 4g signal booster. I have s7 edge connected to 4g same provider, but no data. 3g works fine. The odd thing is that my other phones asus zen 2 laser have 4g and data, i have lenovo also 4g with working 4g data, all same provider. it has got nothing to do about the apn, i have reset it many times no diffrence. so I checked with Network cell info for android, I am now pretty sure that it has got to do with how many bts or network neighbour you can find with 4g. with s7 edge it was connected to 1 4g bts and found 0 4g neighbours. with other working phone i got 2-3 neighbours. I suspect the same thing is happening to mr200,</p>									</div>

It will still have the old modem firmware if you flash with LEDE. I would also like to flash my original MR200 modem but I cant find the firmware for it. TP-Link firmware is very large, I think the extra parts are for the Android modem. If only I can dig into the web flash script maybe then we can extract the android image of the modem. </p><p>Usually one can unlock a modem by AT command, but I am not familiar with MR200 modem. There is a MR200 GPL source including LTE module but, I have no idea how to flash it into the modem. It is an Android modem, so probably can unlock by adb. My modem is dead anyway probably hardware fault but I want to try flashing it if possible.</p><p>After flash with LEDE the modem web server can be enabled. Just read the earlier post in this thread. Maybe you can find something there that can unlock it.</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s a folder in tplink firmware /web containing the router website and there&#039;s softup.htm which handles the router firmware upgrade process. It is referencing to /cgi/softup which I currently don&#039;t have (since I have a broken modem). I would very much appreciate if someone can send me the folder content of &quot;/cgi&quot;. I think there is a script referencing to correct modem firmware update in this folder.</p>									</div>
