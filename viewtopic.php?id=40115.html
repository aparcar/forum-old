					<p>Hi,</p><p>I like to open this thread because the lack of DFS support in OpenWRT.</p><p>For people in US, and similar regulatory domains, the lack of DFS can&#039;t be a problem. You can use channels 48-64 and 149-165 for indoors and outdoors. Nevertheless, for people in EUROPE and similar domains, only channels 100-140 are acceptable for outdoors (channels over 140 are forbidden!). But, as all of you know, these channels (100-140) requires DFS in ALL DOMAINS.</p><p>After that, I suggest to developers of OpenWRT to start to support the DFS functionality.</p><p>From my research, the Linux Wireless community has initial support for a limited set of hardware: ar9280 and other Atheros chips in the family 9K.</p><p>The &quot;ath9k-devel&quot; mailing list is the best place to recopile useful patches. See: <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/ath9k-devel@lists.ath9k.org/info.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/ath9k-devel … /info.html</a> and search for &quot;dfs&quot;.</p><p>I hope to see first snapshots with limited support of DFS in the next months!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Jow,</p><p>Ok. But why OpenWRT don&#039;t support channels 100-140 in CLIENT MODE without DFS support? All wifi cards that works as &quot;client device&quot; don&#039;t have DFS support enabled, but can comunicate with AP with DFS.</p><p>Please, read: <a href="http://www.nts.com/pdf/whitepapers/6_Dynamic%20Frequency%20Selection%20and%20the%205GHz%20Unlicensed%20Band.pdf">http://www.nts.com/pdf/whitepapers/6_Dy … 20Band.pdf</a></p><p>I hope that in a short period of time we can use our OpenWRT devices as a CLIENTS of a VERY EXPENSIVE APs that use channels 100-140 (no one has opensource support for DFS).</p><p>THIS IS MANDATORY IN EUROPE FOR OUTDOORS USE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>onrollo</strong> on 25 Oct 2012, 13:44)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>After some tests with the last snapshots I can confirm that the Atheros driver supports scaning in channels 100-140 without DFS. I&#039;ll check if the CLIENT MODE works in these channels.</p><p>Anyone has more info about DFS in OpenWRT?</p>									</div>
