I&#039;ll give example. download old tplink firmware Archer_MR200(EU)_V1_160310.zip from tplink download page. extract and you will find Archer MR200v1_0.9.1_0.0_full_update(160317)_1041_1021_2005.bin. So it is supposed to be the full update version. <br />open this file in hex editing app and extract from 0x007d0200 until end. save it as zip file. you won&#039;t be able to unzip it properly with windows as it uses unix names. you can try with this zip files to update</p>									</div>

					<p>so the original tplink modem has esmt fm6bd2g1ga flash+ram (2GB Flash +1 GB DDR2 RAM). I need to flash the firmware into this chip combo. I have seen the flash programmer online but the price is not worth it. There are some pads on the modem, they might be the jtag/programming pads. As for the mini pcie connector pads, only 4 visible lines are connected to the pads, so it must be a regular usb interface. Don&#039;t know whats wrong with my modem, when i connected it to router, it is logging as usb connected but then disconnected again. I&#039;m starting to wonder if the problem is just the power circuitry of the modem, can&#039;t find any logic as why the modem flash would be broken.</p>									</div>

					<p>upon inspecting the mini pcie pads, it appears that many if not all of the pads are occupied with connectivity to the board so visibily only 4 pads are connected, but internally many of the pads are in fact connected assuming the board is multi layered.</p>									</div>
