					<p>So I was looking through my /jffs and I noticed that a lot of the files there are exact copies of files from /rom. I know that /jffs stores new files and files from /rom that have been modified but there are absolutely no modifications in many of the files, the md5sum of the two files (the one in /rom and the one in /jffs) is exactly the same. </p><p>Would it be safe to delete the duplicate files in /jffs so they don&#039;t take up extra space?</p><p>I wrote this script to do it but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s safe to run:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/ash

for i in `find /jffs -type f`
do
       original=`echo $i | sed s/jffs/rom/`
       if [ -e $original ]
       then
        i_md5=`md5sum $i | cut -b -32 -`
        orig_md5=`md5sum $original | cut -b -32 -`

        if [ &quot;$i_md5&quot; == &quot;$orig_md5&quot; ]
        then
          echo $i copied but not changed!
          rm $i
        else
          echo $i modified!
        fi
       fi
done</code></pre></div><p>There are about ~24 such files on my system. I&#039;m guessing that they are there since I opened many of the files in /rom with vi. Perhaps that changed the timestamp and mini_fo copied it to /jffs because of that.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Anything that attempts to open the files for write access will create a copy of the file in /jffs, even if the file isn&#039;t modified. So, as an example, simply running &quot;vi /etc/ipkg.conf&quot; without making any changes will result in an /jffs/etc/ipkg.conf.</p><p>Script looks safe enough.</p>									</div>
