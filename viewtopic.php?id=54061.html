					<p>Hi all, anyone know why no connection inside BATMAN repeater nodes (without ethernet &amp; running with batctl gw client).<br />I have 3 DIR 505 running lastest openwrt, and one of them got internet connection through&nbsp; internet cable &amp; working with batctl gw server mode, other nodes working in batctl gw client node.<br />I connected and ssh to client nodes with cable, and i can’t ping to google.com/gateway node ip from inside client nodes. I can do ping google.com inside gateway node without any problem and My wifi working fine here. Look like each of my node can&#039;t reach other and no internet connection inside client nodes.&nbsp; <br />I config my AP following <br /><a href="http://www.radiusdesk.com/technical_discussions/batman_vlan_nat#dokuwiki__content">http://www.radiusdesk.com/technical_dis … i__content</a></p><p>How can I fix this problems?<br />Thanks you very much.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>duongnv_52</strong> on 17 Nov 2014, 06:06)</p>
