					<p>Hi, I need a router that can support repeater mode. I&#039;ve narrowed down to wgt634u and wrt54g. I really like the wgt634u simply because the usb support, yet I need it to act as a repeater mode. Has anyone successfully been able to achieve that?</p>									</div>

I had my LaFonera WiFi router run on a DDWRT firmware configure with a WDS and it worked pretty good.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I&#039;ve narrowed down to wgt634u and wrt54g.
