					<p>@davidc502, As far as I can make out, to test the issue in the thread @yuhhaurlin asked people to test the new BLOB, which is being done, but the <em>new</em> 2.4 issue was noted. Interestingly, I think this BLOB is different than the one issued in the OEM FW that hit the street last month, but I thought it was stated they were to be made the same at some point(rango).</p><p>The commits were independent of that, ongoing work, including a step towards the <a href="https://github.com/kaloz/mwlwifi/issues/159">BSS 802.11r issue</a>.</p>									</div>
