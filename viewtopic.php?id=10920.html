					<p>Yes, that&#039;s normal. failsafe mode only accepts telnet connections. the web interface and ssh is disabled. You&nbsp; need to set your ip statically, set it to 192.168.1.2 with a gateway of 192.168.1.1, your router should be 192.168.1.1</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, I&#039;m having this very issue, icmp and *only* icmp responds.<br />I&#039;m a network engineer by trade so I&#039;m not totally clueless (just to help shed light on what troubleshooting I may have done).</p><p>No telnet, no tcp and no udp (sent or received) to my linux laptop connected directly to it.<br />Nothing from tcpdump either (other than the icmp responses, of course).<br />This is on a WRT54G v2<br />So do I have a brick?<br />Does anyone know how I can recover this puppy? Seems to me that if it&#039;s responding to icmp, it should be accessible somehow, no?<br />Thanks for any insight you guys can provide!</p><p>-Clayton Dukes</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I got it working by plugging it in and doing a TFTP of the original software to it (for whatever reason that was the only .bin file it seemed to accept).<br />Now that I have that fixed, I have a new problem. I loaded openwrt, changed the WAN ip address, saved changes and it seems to have destroyed the router? that&#039;s kinda crappy...needless to say I (was) using a WRT54G v1.0.<br />Here&#039;s a new thread for that issue:<br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=51752#p51752">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=51752#p51752</a></p>									</div>
