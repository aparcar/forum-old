					<p>Hi,</p><p>a couple of weeks ago I made a small mistake while flashing my v8.4 router so i killed my stock uboot and nothing worked any more - obviously no serial console as well.</p><p>Today I got the time to desolder the eeprom, flashed Pepes U-Boot mod (<a href="https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod">https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod</a>)<br />on the device and openwrt 14.07 with the help of the new u-boot.</p><p>So far so good... but I did not get any wifi - wifi0 wasn&#039;t there.</p><p>After some research I learned about the art partition.... okay, The original Art Partition wasn&#039;t available any more, but I have another WR-841N in HW Version 8.4 lying around with openwrt, so I borrowed that art partition - since they wouldnot run in the same network, I wouldn&#039;t bother MAC Address, too...</p><p>But&nbsp; it is not working.<br />Both art partitions dumped are exactly the same (md5sum) but, wlan0 isn&#039;t coming up, and is not configurable by uci or luci..</p><p>on the shell I can scan for networks with:</p><p>/usr/sbin/iw phy phy0 interface add wlan0 type managed<br />/sbin/ifconfig wlan0 hw ether de:ad:be:ef:ba:be<br />/sbin/ifconfig wlan0 up</p><p>/usr/sbin/iw dev wlan0 scan </p><p>And it finds a lot of nearby wireless networks - so the hardware is generally working, the driver itself is working.</p><p>BUT&nbsp; if I leave the &quot;ether ....&quot; parameter in the ifconfig part, the wlan0 inteface won&#039;t come up.</p><p>So the point seems to be, there is no valid mac address stored in the art partition - whats really funny because on the working donor of the art partition everything works fine.</p><p>I think all of the default values are not valid.</p><p>Does anyone has some hints, how to get it working again?&nbsp; I thought &quot;any&quot; art partition of &quot;any&quot; identical atheros SoC should work - not as good as the original, but should work somehow...</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>att15</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Nebbia,</p><p>thanks a lot for your help; I&#039;ll try that - the original u-boot partition is really twice as big as my pepe2k. </p><p>Now, I have to reflash the new U-Boot, what should not be a big Problem since the new Uboot has directly a function for that build in:-)</p><p>But another question...&nbsp; Do you know how to change the MAC Address in the second 64K?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t look it up yet, if I find the MAC<br />address in clear hex/text somewhere in the second part - but is there any kind of checksum which is needed for a valid one?</p><p>Edit: I tried to hexedit the file but I cannot find at least &quot;following&quot; parts of my known Mac Address... So if anyone has an idea where exactly it is stored, would be really nice to know:-)</p><p>Edit2:<br />Since the build-in webflash seems only to allow the first 64KB Uboot part and not the config part, my plan didn&#039;t work out... openwrt has a write lock for the u-boot partition and I was too lazy to recompile a write-unlocked version of it for my 841... <br />The network console and netcat didn&#039;t work either (no one knows why...), so I re-attached my serial converter and could access uboot directly.</p><p>So I checked the store MAC and.... it was a bunch of zeros...&nbsp; &nbsp;but setmac did the trick:</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uboot&gt; setmac
Usage:
setmac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
        - change MAC address stored in FLASH (xx - value in hex format)

uboot&gt; printmac
Current MAC address stored in FLASH at offset 0x9F01FC00: 00:00:00:00:00:00

uboot&gt; setmac be:ac:hb:ab:e0:01
** Notice:
   you should always make a backup of your device
           entire FLASH content before making any changes

Executing: erase 0x9F010000 +0x10000; cp.b 0x80800000 0x9F010000 0x10000

Erase FLASH from 0x9F010000 to 0x9F01FFFF in bank #1
Erasing: #

Erased sectors: 1

Copying to FLASH...
Writting at address: 0x9F010000

Done!

uboot&gt; printmac
Current MAC address stored in FLASH at offset 0x9F01FC00: BE:AC:00:AB:E0:01

uboot&gt; printmodel
Router model stored in FLASH at offset 0x9F01FD00: 0000000000000000

uboot&gt; sync
