					<p>Hello guys,<br />I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and excuse me creating this thread as there are too many threads about this but nothing helped me.<br />So that&#039;s the story: My ISP offered me optic IPTV and internet on a good price. When the guys came to install everything they told me I have to you the router they bring&nbsp; for the IPTV to run or if I have my own router I have to use a switch before the router and to connect he STP to the switch. So I told them I have my own router and they used a switched before it. But now I flashed my TP-Link WR740N with OpenWRT and&nbsp; I want ro remove the switch before my router and connect the STB directly to it. As far as I know i have to create a VLAN and a bridge to the WAN and on LAN port for the STB to work properly. I tried everything but even if the IPTV runs through the router there&#039;s no internet and the opposite. Is there anyone who can guide me.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />OpenWRT version : 12.09<br />Please help me. <br />Cheers!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>intenzive</strong> on 9 Nov 2013, 18:12)</p>

					<p>Hi, <br />I understand the part you say about bridging the WAN and one of the LAN ports in another Vlan and that make sense thinking on the way IPTV work (probably multicast).<br />However I don&#039;t fully understand when you say &quot; I tried everything but even if the IPTV runs through the router there&#039;s no internet and the opposite&quot;<br />Are you saying that this LAN port that is bridged with the WAN for the IPTV is not getting internet connection or it it the router itself having this problem ?</p>									</div>

When i go to Network-&gt;Switch I see this:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://istorebg.com/1.jpg" alt="http://istorebg.com/1.jpg" /></span><br />How exactly I have to do this with this config?<br />And after that what about the bridge between tha WAN and the separated LAN port:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://istorebg.com/2.jpg" alt="http://istorebg.com/2.jpg" /></span><br />I am aware after creating a new VLAN I will see it in the bridge list in the WAN settings but what is the right configuration? Do I have to change the bridge settings also in LAN:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://istorebg.com/3.jpg" alt="http://istorebg.com/3.jpg" /></span> <br />Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>intenzive</strong> on 22 Nov 2013, 23:03)</p>
