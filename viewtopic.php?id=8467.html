					<p>only other way i know of is the jtag method. If the lights come on (dmz and power) and it can be pinged, then you can try using tftp, have it running, manually assign your ip addy to 192.168.1.2, power off unit,then power on and start tftp right away.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. No, no traffic coming from the router (well, LAN port 1 anyway) - checked with ethereal.</p><p>I tried grounding pins 15 and 16 (as advised in another webpage), and I noticed another website (<a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1432&amp;highlight=wrt54g">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/forums/vi … ght=wrt54g</a>) that suggests for the V3.1 to short pins 5 and 6 (i think), but I&#039;m a little afraid of doing this in case it damages my flash chip.</p><p>Would you know where I can find instructions on using the JTAG interface please? Is this the only option left to me please?</p><p>Many thanks for the quick reply!<br />Ed</p>									</div>

					<p>Shorting pins was a very stupid idea. You should hope that you didn&#039;t kill your flash chip. For JTAG info check out the Debrick utility from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/utils/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/utils/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi. I managed to get the router pingable again by setting my PC IP addr to 192.168.1.2. and I&#039;ve also been able to upload firmware using the tftp utility (the latest linksys firmware), but upon rebooting, the power led still flashes constantly, I can still ping it, but still unable to connect to port 80 (the web interface). Any ideas please? Maybe I should try using the linksys util to upload the openwrt firmware now and see if that works?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks to all for your advice. As I was finally able to ping the router, I was also then able to use the linksys tftp.exe utility to upload firmware. Sometimes I found I needed to press the reset button for about 20 seconds before the OS booted up (no power off was required). </p><p>Thanks again - I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t fry my flash chip by grounding it earlier - I think you&#039;ve done the right thing removing that section from your FAQ - just hope that other websites (such as DD-WRT) also remove it from their FAQs now - as i think it&#039;s relevant only to certain versions of the WRT54G...</p>									</div>
