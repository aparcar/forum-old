					<p>Hello all,</p><p>I am new to this&nbsp; forum, but I have read quite a few topics in the past few weeks, and I need some advice.<br />Here are a brief description.<br />I would like to hack a router in the way that it can play mp3 files form a NAS server samba or ftp compatible on the network, and play real audio files from the internet, all on the press of a button, that could be either a USB remote control receiver or a USB keypad. the audio will be played through some USB speakers.<br />The sole way the the router will connect to the network is by using the existing wireless connection (WDB compatible).<br />And here are the questions:<br />1) Is this achievable? and what would be the biggest problems I could encounter.<br />2) Can you advise on which could be the ideal router to buy. (cheaper the better)<br />3) What would be the must have features of the router (a part from USB and wireless)<br />4) Has anybody done this before?</p><p>Thank you very much for your help<br /><img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that look interesting.</p><p>It doesn&#039;t specify if he uses Real Audio streaming, but I think it can be a good starting point.<br />Another question:<br />Is Real Audio supported in OpenWRT?</p>									</div>
