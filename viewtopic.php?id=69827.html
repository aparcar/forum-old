					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve just installed&nbsp; openwrt-15.05-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3020-v1-squashfs-factory.bin on my rooter.&nbsp; I&#039;m now trying to setup my Huawei usb dongle. I&#039;ve read a tutorial ( webpage :h t t p <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" />/ madet.my/2014/10/setup-openwrt-on-tp-link-tl-mr3020/) that I need to install some packages first to enable USB services. I have connected the MR3020 by ethernet on my PC which have internet connection from iphone (USB).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>When I try to &quot;update Lists&quot; , I get :</p><p>wget: bad address &#039;downloads.openwrt. org&#039; . So maybe the router dont see the internet?</p><p>I then tried to find a way to download manually the said packages by using the links from the log file without success.&nbsp; </p><p>What is the best way to make to make that 4G dongle works? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>regards,</p><p>Fred</p>									</div>

					<p>thank you for you help!&nbsp; I was able to install all these package except usb-modeswitch-data which I receive the&nbsp; &quot;unknown package&quot; message.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to reboot and list the device with &quot;cat /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot; in putty but I receive &quot;no such file or directory&quot; message.</p><p>I guess the usb-modeswitch-data package is really needed..</p><p>Fred</p>									</div>
