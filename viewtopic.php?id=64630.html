					<p>Wouldn&#039;t that be illegal according to the GPL? I was pretty sure that you can&#039;t &quot;claim&quot; open source software as your own and make money off of it, you can only make money off of supporting that software (a la Red Hat). IMO there is no IP in OpenWRT, it&#039;s just a minimal Linux distribution. The only custom thing that I see is Luci. I think a good comparison (after Red Hat) would be FreeNAS/TrueNAS which is owned by IX Systems. FreeNAS is based on FreeBSD, so they can&#039;t sell FreeBSD or TrueNAS/FreeNAS itself since it&#039;s really just a GUI for FreeBSD, what they do sell is support for the product and the hardware itself which runs *NAS. </p><p>I&#039;m interested to see what this leads to because while OpenWRT is awesome and better than DD-WRT and Tomato IMO, it&#039;s a mess to try and figure out when you come in without any knowledge.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brando56894</strong> on 6 May 2016, 23:12)</p>

And a PITA to figure out, when a&nbsp; certain script is executed. And why.<br />openwrt for me not to be used on small x86, as small debians (i.e. voyage) available.</p>									</div>

Nor any entity guarding &#039;IP&#039;. It&#039;s pretty weird to hear you talking about IP when 90% of the software (disregarding the binary manufacturer blobs one cannot work around in a lot of cases) OpenWrt uses is covered by <strong>copyleft</strong> licensing.</p><p>I call BS.</p>									</div>
