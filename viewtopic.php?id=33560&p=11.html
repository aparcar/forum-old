					<p>I know that closed source broadcom drivers were one of the reasons we couldn&#039;t have kernel 3.3 support, and therefore codel support, in the past. Now that we have kernel 3.3 running on broadcom, does this mean we get codel support for these routers too?</p>									</div>

					<p>But there is a difference. WIFI to WAN is not the same as WIFI to LAN.

					<p>Just thought I would let you all know that my ruse outlined in reply 255 above works like a dream. There are a couple of gotchas that I fell over though.

					<p>Anybody succeeded with AP+STA configuration (broadcom drivers)?<br/>I am trying to set up a wireless repeater, but no matter what I try wireless authentication (WPA2) to the router (repeater) never finishes (wlan is visible, no one can connect). If the repeater is not connected to the router, clients can connect to the repater without any problem. If the repeater is connected to the original router (through wlan) internet is accessible through ethernet. I have tried both routed and non-routed setups (two subnets, NAT; same bridge, no NAT, no DHCP; I am generally using the same settings, that work under dd-wrt with same router, so settings should be ok).
