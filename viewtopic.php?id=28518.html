					<p>So I flashed from DDWRT to Open WRT via DDWRT command line and that went fine.&nbsp; Changed ip range in web interface to 192.168.0.1 and then cloned my MAC on the router so that the cable modem would connect.&nbsp; This caused the router to reboot and the web interface never came back.</p><p>Seems like DHCP is working as I get an IP assigned on the laptop but cannot ping the router or anythign else.</p><p>Tried a whole bunch of times to access the TFTP interval with 2 different win7 machines and an xp machine with and without a switch.</p><p>I can however get into OpenWRT Failsafe mode but I have no clue if you can flash an image through that.&nbsp; My big issue is how do I get an image onto the box through telnet.&nbsp; Not really a linux guru.&nbsp; </p><p>I tried the following in failsafe:</p><p>firstboot&nbsp; </p><p>/sbin/mount_root</p><br /><p>I also tried &quot;passwd&quot;&nbsp; as the screen message seems to indicate that this will start SSH but it says the password file is read only.&nbsp; In fact it seems that everything is read only.&nbsp; I thought &quot;/sbin/mount_root&quot; made it writable but maybe not.</p><p>So ... can anyone give me steps on how to flash a new image via failsafe mode?</p>									</div>

					<p>Just want to follow up as I finally got tftp working after about 40 tries.&nbsp; Still didn&#039;t figure out if/how you can recover from Failsafe mode.</p><p>Thought I&#039;d post what eventually worked for me in case it helps others.</p><p>Here&#039;s the secret recipe for me:</p><p>WinXP computer no firewalls<br />Connect via switch to computer and the port closest to the WAN port on the router<br />Change Windows network adapter from autonegotiate to 100 mb/s duplex<br />Set static IP of 192.168.11.2 and set Default Gateway and Preferred DNS to 192.168.11.1 in Windows XP<br />Disabled wireless or any other network adapters besides the one your using<br />Connect everything up except for the power to the router</p><br /><br /><p>Now open 2 CMD prompts.</p><p>In the first put the following but dont hit enter:</p><p> arp -s 192.168.11.1 [MAC ADDRESS OF ROUTER]</p><p>In the second put the following but dont hit enter:</p><p> tftp -i 192.168.11.1 PUT whatever_frimware.bin </p><p>Whatever you are using need needs to exist in the current path as noted in the tftp CMD window </p><p>Now quickly hit enter for the arp CMD window then the tftp CMD window and then plug in the router power.</p><p>In a ccouple of tries you should get a message in the tftp CMD window indicating you successfully uploaded</p><p>Now WAIT WAIT WAIT.&nbsp; It will take a long long time but eventually the router will stop flashing red and eventually reboot and settle down and run normal.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>What didn&#039;t work:</p><p>Didn&#039;t work without the switch in the middle .&nbsp; I think the tftp window is just too fast and the network connection on the computer just doesn&#039;t settle down quick enough without it</p><p>tftp2.exe didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Even using the same setup as above.&nbsp; I had one time where it acted like it partially worked but it never seemed to push the full image up.</p><p>Windows 7 didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Even with the switch I could never get it to work.&nbsp; Not sure why as it seems others have been successful but</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks to all for the guides and info on the site.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wow... all I gotta say is...&nbsp; FYI ... totally not helpful.</p><p>Posting a link with no further comment... lame ... I was gonna be the bigger person and let it go but can&#039;t after the 2nd time.&nbsp; &nbsp; Gotta wonder where some posters have learned their netiquette.&nbsp; I searched, I read, I tried to do this myself without posting for nearly 12 hours.&nbsp; Finally decided to reach out for some help.&nbsp; I&#039;m Sorry I did.</p><p>FYI - The first link you gave me was on how to initiate tftp calls through linux when I was asking about failsafe mode.&nbsp; Not relevent at all to what I was doing or asking in my first post.&nbsp; Not to mention I had read that page several times before posting.&nbsp; </p><p>The second link you provided was equally a waste of time as I tried that method about 30 times on different computers and although it has good information...guess what... I&#039;ve read it...&nbsp; it didn&#039;t work... it still doesn&#039;t work.</p><br /><p>Let me tell you why this page doesn&#039;t help me:</p><p>1) From what I have read you can only recover this particular router from one specific lan port.&nbsp; Port 0 or the one closest to the WAN port.&nbsp; This tftp recovery page says nothing about this.<br />2) It doesn&#039;t tell you to disable your firewall<br />3) It doesn&#039;t mention any potential issues with Windows 7 and from all the other posts I&#039;ve read there has been a lot<br />4) It doesn&#039;t suggest using a switch to connect devices<br />5) It doesn&#039;t suggest changing your network connection from auto negotiate to a fixed speed or talk about issues with gigabit lan cards<br />6) It suggests using the linksys tftp utility (tftp2.exe) which did not and will not work for me<br />7) It says to use the following for ARP binding &quot;netsh interface ipv4 add neighbors 12 192.168.11.1 00-1d-12-34-56-78&quot; which didn&#039;t work and on one computer I couldn&#039;t even get it to execute correctly as it would not recognize the interface number for my lan card</p><p>I&#039;m not a total newb when it comes to flashing routers or hardware in general.&nbsp; I just never bricked one until OpenWRT.&nbsp; Been using DD-WRT and other custom firmware of all flavors for years.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thought I&#039;d give OpenWRT a try but seeing how just changing the ip range and the MAC address was enough to brick my router, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m going to invest too much more time in it at this point.</p><p>Again thanks to all that have posted relevant and beneficial information elsewhere.&nbsp; Saved me from having to get out the soldering iron and terminaling into the box.</p><p>And I&#039;m not dogging on OpenWrt ... I think it&#039;s cool.. just not for me and my router at this time.</p>									</div>
