					<p>This could be a known issue with the NAT and MTU. Since the packets coming out from your host machine are generally 1500 (the MTU of 100Mbit ethernet) and they are then NATed by the WRT adding some bytes, they become fragmented. Some sites are paranoid and refuse such fragmented packets. Try reducing the MTU to 1300.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TemplaraPhoenix</strong> on 12 May 2006, 09:08)</p>

					<p>They work fine for me (Linksys WRT54GS with RC5).<br />Does one of theese websites work: <a href="http://www.genie.de">www.genie.de</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.wallstreet-online.de">www.wallstreet-online.de</a> <a href="http://www.gmx.de">www.gmx.de</a> ?<br />If not it is an MTU Problem. Try reducing the MTU from 1500 to 1492 &quot;nvram set ppp_mtu=1492; nvram commit&quot; and check the mtu after reboot &quot;nvram show | grep mtu&quot; aswell as &quot;ifconfig ppp0&quot;.<br />Is your ISP Arcor? I think they use a lower standard MTU. Try &quot;ping -f -l 1464 heise.de&quot; on a windows machine. (1464+28=)1492 so you shouldnt get an fragmentation flag message, in case you do reduce the value untill you dont receive the message anymore, add 28 and set that value as MTU on your Router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Kasei, </p><p>you must be a real network crack! Thank you :-)</p><p>By the way, how do you find out about the maximum allowed MTU for a special website like gmx.de?</p><p><a href="http://www.gmx.de">www.gmx.de</a> works for me, but <a href="http://www.wallstreet">www.wallstreet</a>-online and <a href="http://www.genie.de">www.genie.de</a> don&#039;t work. I tried the ping on heise de and reduced the packet size to 1272, then I got ping-awnser from heise.de. So I entered 1300 for the ppp_mtu, but it didn&#039;t help. I even tried to set ppp_mtu=200. Still the pages postbank.de, genie.de, wallstree-online.de don&#039;t work. Then I tried the other flag, wan_pppoe_mtu to set on 1300 (it was also 1492) - no result.</p><p>Even my provider-site <a href="http://www.congster.de">www.congster.de</a> doesn&#039;t come up!<br />The bizzare thing also is that I have another router (3com), and there I have MTU=1492 configured. And I do not have a problem receiving the pages...</p><p>I hope you have some more hints for me....</p><p>Thanks,<br />Bernd</p>									</div>

					<p>Well i guess the problem is that your Asus router fragments your packets <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> Some websites simply drop fragmented packets because there are several attacks that use fragmentated packets.<br />Try opening the regeditor and find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\ Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces<br />you should see several folders. Browse trough them and look for an entry that matches your local ip-adress(cmd ipconfig). Right click in that folder and press add new dword-value. Name it &quot;MTU&quot; and set the decimal value to 1300. Restart your computer and try to reach thoose sites again(remove that entry after you are finished with testing!).<br />Are you using the white russian RC5 on that router?<br />Please post your MTU value from <a href="http://www.speedguide.net/analyzer.php">http://www.speedguide.net/analyzer.php</a> before and after adding the registry key.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kasei</strong> on 13 May 2006, 16:25)</p>

					<p>Hi, sorry for highjacking this thread, but seems to fit good in here:</p><p>The Speedguide gives me (for my 2M/192k line):</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Default TCP Receive Window (RWIN) = 5840<br />RWIN Scaling (RFC1323) = 2 bits (scale factor of 4)<br />Unscaled TCP Receive Window = 1460</p><p>RWIN seems to be set to a very small number. If you&#039;re on a broadband connection, consider using a larger value.<br />For optimum performance, consider changing RWIN to a multiple of MSS.<br />Other RWIN values that might work well with your current MTU/MSS:<br />511104 (MSS x 44 * scale factor of 8)<br />255552 (MSS x 44 * scale factor of 4)<br />127776 (MSS x 44 * scale factor of 2)<br /> 63888 (MSS x 44)</p></blockquote></div><p>But my connection seems quite good. Should i change the rwin setting? <br />And if, where do i change it, in my router or my pc?<br />How do i change my rwin on Linux, a quick google search did not give me an answer?</p>									</div>

					<p>It doesn´t fit in here <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /><br />I think the site cant detect the values correctly on a linux os. If you would have started a download with that setting youd know there was something wrong <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> (something &lt;60kbyte/s)<br />cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max should tell you the correct value. To change it simply &quot;echo XXXXX &gt; /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max&quot; default should be 109568. I dont think it would affect your pc if the router value was wrong so you need to change it on your pc if you feel like you need to.<br />Check out <a href="http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/tcptune/#Linux">http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/tcptune/#Linux</a></p>									</div>
