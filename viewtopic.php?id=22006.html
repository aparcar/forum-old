					<p>Hi,</p><p>I had managed to recover routers without resorting to JTAG till now. I managed to brick couple of routers in last few weeks and needed to recover them. As I did not want to solder a buffered JTAG on a breadboard, I got a buffered JTAG pcb done based on schematic on Wiki.</p><p>As there was a MoQ for PCB&#039;s I have some PCB&#039;s to spare. If anyone needs a PCB, please let me know. I will try to mail it as long as Postal charges are viable to your location. </p><p>Please note that the schematic is modified with suggested changes on Wiki which can be enabled/disabled with a Jumper.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Venkatesh K</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kaevee</strong> on 2 Oct 2009, 15:56)</p>
