					<p>Yesterday I spent 2+ hours trying to figure out why &quot;mount -t vfat /dev/sda3 /usr/share/wdir&quot; didn&#039;t work when all of its elements were correct.&nbsp; This is while using stock image for the NSLU2 of Feb 15, 2009 -- openwrt-nslu2-squashfs.bin -- found here: <a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/8.09/ixp4xx/">http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/8.09/ixp4xx/</a></p><p>I was following this wiki article: <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/HowToInstallOntoUsbDrive.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/HowToInstall â€¦ Drive.html</a></p><p>I finally found a site through google which suggested that vfat needed codepages.&nbsp; I installed kmod-nls-cp437 and kmod-nls-iso8859-1 and all was well.&nbsp; Now that I found it I remember going through the same process with the custom build (which no longer works properly because of kernel package inconsistancies) about 4 months ago.</p><p>Could someone update the dependencies for kmod-fs-vfat to include these codepage items so that the necessary code pages are installed when vfat is installed?</p>									</div>
