					<p>Hey folks.&nbsp; I &#039;thought&#039; I had opened a bug report on this, but now I can&#039;t find this bug listed.&nbsp; It might be a few days until I can open a new bug, so I thought I&#039;d post here and get some input.&nbsp; I&#039;m dealing with a neighborhood power outage due to some flooding...</p><p>Anyway, at home, I have two domains that get updated by my dyndns config in OpenWrt, and I&#039;m either running Backfire or Attitude Adjustment.&nbsp; Can&#039;t verify which at the moment, see above.&nbsp; In Luci, I had both domains configured in a single entry, hostname entered in the format: example1.com;example2.com</p><p>My DynDNS provider accepts this format, and even recommends it for multiple domain updates since it&#039;s one update rather than multiple.</p><p>Running Chaos Calmer, I attempted to duplicate this setup, and the Luci interface complained about the DNS name, and wouldn&#039;t save my entry.&nbsp; I was able to get around this by editing the config file directly.&nbsp; My router with CC is only running as a test device at present and is not in production, so I&#039;m not sure that this edited config will actually work, but don&#039;t see why it wouldn&#039;t.</p><p>So, my question to those still following along, if you have multiple domains, do you just create separate entries, or have you kludged something together that works for multiples?</p><p>The bug report I thought I had filed was just against the Luci module being too strict about checking the hostname, but if there is some deeper reason for this, I&#039;d love to hear about it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />the ticket is still open: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/19632">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/19632</a> and I send an answer short term.<br />Here again:<br />From my point of view it&#039;s technical not possible to run ddns-scripts Ver. 1.0.0 without errors, because the command used to verify your domain/host is the nslookup command. But nslookup did not accept a comma or semicolon separated list of hosts to verify.<br />That&#039;s the reason why new luci-app-ddns only accept ONE hostname.<br />Old ddns-scripts not logging every error to logfile/syslog. Try your configuration running dynamic_dns_updater.sh from console.<br />#&gt; dynamic_dns_updater.sh [sectionname]&nbsp; 1<br />As already asked in the response to your ticket:<br />- are you running a different backend behind luci-app-ddns ?<br />- send me a copy of your /etc/config/ddns file. (If you prefer per direct mail)<br />Christian</p>									</div>

					<p>Chris, thanks for finding that ticket and your response.&nbsp; Mostly I was trying to determine if this was an unusual situation, or if others were also wanting or able to combine updates in a single entry.</p><p>I will follow up in that bug report more when I&#039;m home this evening, now that power is back on, and respond more to your questions there.&nbsp; I suppose what would be needed would be for the hostname to be parsed before sending it to nslookup for resolution.&nbsp; I will see if I can dig into that script a bit more tonight.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure how many other DynDNS providers allow multiple hostnames in a single update, I can&#039;t imagine that mine is unique in that aspect.</p>									</div>

					<p>Jim,<br />there are some DynDNS providers accepting multiple hosts in a single update and some others that update multiple hosts internally with one given host.</p><p>ddns-scripts was designed to update one host per section fitting for most users.</p><p>The following settings should do the job for you:<br />In Luci: servicename --custom--<br />in /etc/config/ddns remove option service_name<br />in option domain / hostname put in one of your hosts/FQDNs that needs to be monitored/updated<br />in option update_url / Custom URL put<br /><strong><a href="http://www.dnsexit.com/RemoteUpdate.sv?login=">http://www.dnsexit.com/RemoteUpdate.sv?login=</a>[USERNAME]&amp;password=[PASSWORD]&amp;myip=[IP]&amp;host=...</strong><br />behind host= fill in the semicolon separated list of the hosts/FQDNs that you want to update as a &quot;hardcoded&quot; list.</p><p>Do not edit the /usr/lib/ddns/services* files because they might change on next update.<br />Please give me a feedback, if the above settings work for dnsexit.com so I can update the WIKI.</p><p>Christian</p>									</div>
