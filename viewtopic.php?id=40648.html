					<p>Hello.<br />I need collect all network statistics(not only HTTP/HTTPS) by law, so i think netflow would be optimal.<br />Can you advise OpenWRT&#039;s package for collecting netflow data and sending it to remote server via secure protocol? If this can be done without any additional packages(like VPN), it would be great.<br />Thanks.</p><p>P.S. What difference between <strong>softflowd</strong>, <strong>rflow</strong>, <strong>ntop</strong> and <strong>fprobe</strong>? I can&#039;t find any information about this packages on wiki.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i.s.reji</strong> on 21 Nov 2012, 07:57)</p>

					<p>Forgive me for re-surrecting this old topic, but is there any new development regarding collecting traffic stats on OpenWRT ?</p><p>From the options suggested above, it seems that only <strong>softflowd</strong> and <strong>fprobe</strong> are currently available as packages, although both seem quite outdated.</p><p>Currently OpenWRT offers softflowd v0.9.8 (note: at OpenWRT patchwork there&#039;s a <a href="http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/5769/">pending update to v0.9.9</a> which was released 2+ years ago). The last update to softflowd was a few months ago, see <a href="https://code.google.com/p/softflowd/source/list">https://code.google.com/p/softflowd/source/list</a>.</p><p>The fprobe software was last updated in 2005.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kpv</strong> on 4 Jul 2014, 19:17)</p>

					<p>After tons of reading and testing of packages I found the (quite bad documented) solution most people seem to end up with.</p><p>You can collect fine graded statistics using iptables and analyze/visualize them using luci-app-statistics and collectd-mod-rrdtool and collectd-mod-iptables...<br />This seems to be the OpenWRT way of doing statistics...</p><p>If you really want to use the netflow protocol, you will need to do the visualization on a different host.</p>									</div>
