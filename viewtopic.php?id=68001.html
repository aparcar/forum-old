					<p>Just wanna say that I successfully flashed a Zyxel EMG2926 (the one from Videotron, in Quebec) with Chaos Calmer. I followed the instructions for the zyxel_nbg6716.</p><p>For what I have seen, the hardware is almost identical (in fact, I can&#039;t find a difference yet) and so far, everything is working perfectly.</p><p>Anyone else is using the router ? or know the difference between these two ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, so I have a question. I&#039;m fairly new to this, but I have a Zyxel EMG2926 with Videotron and I wanna install openwrt onto the router. Videotron only gives a user account named admin, the supervisor account doesn&#039;t work. Is there anyway to get the supervisor account to work or do I have to buy a serial cable to connect to the router. Thanks!</p><p>UPDATE: So I was able to edit the html code via the WUI using inspect element to change the group to Administrator from User but now I need to know once I get the serial cable what would be the best program to use to connect to the router? Also if anyone&#039;s able to tell me if this serial cable is good, I&#039;d grately appreciate it. Amazon.ca search up B00CD264HG in the search bar.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dpiper01</strong> on 31 Dec 2016, 23:10)</p>
