					<p>Hi, I was happy with my OpenWRT as a main router but I got another one and I&#039;d now like to use my OpenWRT as a simple switch to add ethernet ports.<br />I want to plug my OpenWRT WAN port to a LAN port of my new router and let openWRT LAN ports receive DHCP from main router.<br />Is there any way to achieve this ?<br />Thanks in advance <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You do not want to use the WAN port, connect the LAN from the main device to LAN port on the secondary device and use this recipe:&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a></p><p>It may be possible to convert the WAN to another LAN port, but get this done first and if you need this include the make and model of your router</p>									</div>
