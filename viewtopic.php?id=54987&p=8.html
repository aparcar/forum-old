As for the performance, with a 100/40 Mbps Internet connection on the Ookla Speedtest I am getting something like 90-94/38-42 Mbps (connected through Wifi), while the theoretical limit with the Fast Ethernet switch, which is the bottleneck here, is 95.87 Mbps (<a href="http://baturin.org/tools/encapcalc/">Ethernet, PPPoE, IPv4 and TCP overhead</a> - rough calculation, might be wrong), so I didn&#039;t do any further performance checks as I figured I&#039;m already getting more than I expected with this hardware.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>bdonkey wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>StrangeOrange, thanks so much for posting such clear and detailed documentation on your custom version!

You can see the list of what is being removed (and change it) in the patch source (the file <strong>rm_packages.txt</strong>). As far as I remember, I only removed the kernel modules related to tunneling, proprietary VPNs, and the Chinese codepage. </p><p>As for PandoraBox, I don&#039;t really know how to find out support for which hardware is compiled in, as there&#039;s neither <strong>/proc/config.gz</strong> nor <strong>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.builtin</strong> and I can&#039;t see their <strong>.config</strong> either because we don&#039;t have the source code (there&#039;s one repository <a href="https://github.com/luyujun/pandorabox">on GitHub</a>, and another one at <strong>svn://svn.openwrt.org.cn/</strong> but both seem to be outdated). If there&#039;s any particular command that would answer this question for you, let me know and I can run it on my router and paste the output here.</p>									</div>

Or is it normal?</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi FJorgeR,</p><p>Even though the Optimal version comes preloaded with config files, some of them still get overwritten during the first boot. This happens due to more than a couple of original scripts doing their stuff, not just in one place, so for practical reasons instead of making a lot of changes to a lot of files I included a custom <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> script that runs last and copies over all those preloaded settings once again. Afterwards, doing a reboot is one way to make sure they are fully applied. This should only happen on first boot as the <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> script deletes itself after its job is done.</p><p>To sum it up, if it only happens once, it&#039;s normal, and it should be over very fast. For the details of what it&#039;s all about, see the files <strong>/rom/etc/rc.local</strong> and <strong>/sbin/revert_config</strong>. This was the least invasive way to do it I could come up with, and believe me, I spent some time on it trying many things (admittedly mostly waiting for the filesystem to rebuild, and the router to reflash and reboot, etc.) I&#039;m not completely satisfied with the way this is done now (a reboot should be avoidable) but it&#039;s progress compared to copying the settings over manually. (As usual, if anyone has a better idea, please feel free to share).</p>									</div>

This happens due to more than a couple of original scripts doing their stuff, not just in one place, so for practical reasons instead of making a lot of changes to a lot of files I included a custom <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> script that runs last and copies over all those preloaded settings once again. Afterwards, doing a reboot is one way to make sure they are fully applied. This should only happen on first boot as the <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> script deletes itself after its job is done.</p><p>To sum it up, if it only happens once, it&#039;s normal, and it should be over very fast. For the details of what it&#039;s all about, see the files <strong>/rom/etc/rc.local</strong> and <strong>/sbin/revert_config</strong>. This was the least invasive way to do it I could come up with, and believe me, I spent some time on it trying many things (admittedly mostly waiting for the filesystem to rebuild, and the router to reflash and reboot, etc.) I&#039;m not completely satisfied with the way this is done now (a reboot should be avoidable) but it&#039;s progress compared to copying the settings over manually.

mtd4: 00f80000 00010000 &quot;firmware&quot;</code></pre></div><p>Or 16252928, so there is some discrepancy. However OS1 is still larger than the firmware image file, so there issue is not here really.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>fjorger wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>But one hypothesis come to my mind, you do (at a specific time) erase the script that is running at start up, right? What if it&#039;s not possible to erase it? It will do the changes again and again and again.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think you&#039;re onto something here. The <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> script removes itself after it&#039;s done and before rebooting the system. But since it&#039;s in the ROM partition, it cannot really be deleted, so what happens is that a symbolic link is created on the <strong>/overlay</strong> partition with the target <strong>(overlay-whiteout)</strong> to mark it as deleted.</p><p>So if the <strong>/overlay</strong> partition were not mounted when it was trying to delete itself, it would just get an error saying something like <em>rm: Read-only filesystem</em> and then it would still be present upon the next boot.</p><p>One reason this could happen is if the JFFS2 (writeable) filesystem failed to be initialized because it didn&#039;t find its marker (0xDEADC0DE).</p><p>The JFFS2 initialization problem will usually appear when going from larger to smaller firmware and there is some leftover garbage in the partition that interferes with the supposedly empty space that is assigned to JFFS2. I think that&#039;s what likely happened here, especially as, if I recall correctly, Xiaomi stock images are in the neighborhood of 12MB. So I&#039;d venture a guess that reflashing from stock would have probably worked if you first did an <strong>mtd erase OS1</strong>.</p><p>The firmware image includes the part called a padding to remedy that but I set the build script not to exceed 8MB in size when creating the padding, as I got the impression that it would break the flashing compatibility in some situations. Since the kernel and filesystem are already nearly 8MB by themselves that means the full padding is not appended. Perhaps the limit can be lifted so that the Optimal image includes the whole padding (about 150 kB). Then erasing the partition beforehand would not be necessary in such a scenario.</p><p>Still, no matter what it shouldn&#039;t end up with a boot loop. It&#039;s funny that when I wrote the script it didn&#039;t appear to me such a thing could happen (and in fact it just did). Now it seems obvious that, at the very least, the first line of <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> should be something like: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>fgrep -qs /overlay &lt; /proc/mounts || exit 1</code></pre></div><p>Thanks for bringing this interesting scenario to my attention.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>fjorger wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>So, you recommend this bootloader [<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=304873#p304873">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 73#p304873</a>] ?<br/>Details here [<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=303496#p303496">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 96#p303496</a>] , but one thing we might lose is the USB fail safe mode?
