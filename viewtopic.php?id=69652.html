					<p>I manage by myself my original art partition, now I&#039;m able to get stronger power. At 30 dBm max speed is 24/28 mbs, but at 25dbm the speed and signal strength is the maximum speed 43/120 MBS and signal good on the receiver side. Real speed of my link of around 150 meters completely without los tested with my nas download speed is 2.5/3 megabytes at second.&nbsp; The hacked v9 partition on my router give me low speed and low signal.</p>									</div>
