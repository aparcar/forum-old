					<p>Hi, is there a recommended Atheros card that works perfectly for the Asus WL-500g Premium V1? It seems this may be the Wistron CM9, if so is there a good place to buy it for less than $40 new before S&amp;H (I am in US)? It seems these were new on Ebay for not too much more than $10 in the past 30 days (completed listings)...</p><p>Thanks<br />Misha</p>									</div>

I&#039;m mainly looking towards what I am going to do when 8.08 comes out. My understanding is still (and from looking over the thread you referenced I didn&#039;t see anything to clearly contradict this) that you still can&#039;t run an AP (for other computers to connect to) from the Asus on 2.6 kernel with the broadcom card. Am I not understanding this correctly?</p><p>Thank you<br />Misha</p>									</div>
