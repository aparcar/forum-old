					<p>Forgive me if I am posting to the wrong forum.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to find out how to modify the default options used to launch udhcpc client in busybox but so far I have had no joy.&nbsp; I want the -t option (retries) to be greater than 0 as sometimes the dhcp server is a bit slow to respond.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried setting options in CONFIG_IFUPDOWN_UDHCPC_CMD_OPTION&nbsp; but this appears to get ignored.</p><p>I have also tried to modify ifupdown.c source where it launches udhcpc but again it does not pick up my modification and ps -a on my device still show udhcpc to be running with -t 0</p><p>Is there anywhere else in the openwrt system that sets options and/or launches the udhcpc client.&nbsp; My understanding was that udhcpc is started from ifup, and this picked up its config options from CONFIG_IFUPDOWN_UDHCPC_CMD_OPTION, however what appears in the ps listing is not consistent with my undestanding.</p><p>Many Thanks for any points.</p><p>Coldo</p>									</div>

					<p>There are no such plans at the moment, however we could introduce an option &quot;udhcpc_options&quot; which would work similar to &quot;pppd_options&quot;.</p>									</div>
