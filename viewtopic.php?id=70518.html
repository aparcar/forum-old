					<p>folks,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Needing a hand setting up dynamic vlans on an ee brightbox – arcadyan7516.<br />Please forgive the lack of initial detail as i&#039;ll try to keep it as much to the point as I believe it is – looking forward to being corrected.</p><p>Openwrt installed as well as hostapd</p><p>Raspberrypi setup as a radius server and working. 3 users configured (test, test2 &amp; test3) assigned to vlan1, vlan2 and vlan3 respectively.</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve got so far.&nbsp; If a wifi client logs on to vlan1, all is fine – local access and can get out to the net. Vlan1 was the original &#039;lan&#039; and is “cat5&#039;d” to the my isp provided home router. <br />The problem is vlans 2 and 3 cant.&nbsp; If I logon as &#039;test3&#039;, i&#039;m connected and assigned a proper address – 192.168.3.x-&nbsp; but I cant access the net.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried adding static routes, changing gateways as per the interface and whats dished out by dhcp.&nbsp; both using the shell and luci.&nbsp; Have tried the &#039;192.168.1.254&#039; actual gateway that is accessable from vlan1.&nbsp; Which brings me to the kicker... the vlan3 wifi client can ping 192.168.3.1 and .1.1 and also 192.168.1.9 the cable connected radiuspi). It can&#039;t ping&nbsp; .254 or get out to the net.&nbsp; &nbsp;At which point I actually swapped the cables around but still nothing.</p><p>Really struggling here and just hoping for a fruitful dialogue.</p><p>Fingers crossed &amp; flame proofs on..</p>									</div>

					<p>Check the firewall, the network config, and routing.&nbsp; I find the UCI firewall very difficult to understand, so I roll my own iptables rules, so my examples aren&#039;t going to be much use.</p><p>I have a number of VLANs, 4 inward facing, 2 outward facing, and it all works but it took a while to work out.</p><p>Also, if you&#039;re going through a switch, make sure it supports vlans, and that it&#039;s correctly configured on the ports you&#039;re using for the vlans.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks for the reply.</p><p>I ventured up into my loft and dug out an old hub.&nbsp; Sniffed the cable to the ISP router and saw that the openwrt router was sending the ping, but it looks like ISP router doesn&#039;t know where to send its reply.<br />Thought it be smart and just open up the ISP router&#039;s lan, but alas the ui only let&#039;s me change the last octet of the net mask.<br />I suppose I could divi up the class c that the ISP router has, but I don&#039;t want to do that.<br />looking through the openwrt features, I think I&#039;m going to start playing with masquerading and putting static routes onto vlans 2 &amp; 3 to point everything to vlan1.</p><p>I don&#039;t know why I expected the other vlans to &#039;just work&#039; but hey sometimes can&#039;t see the woods for the trees.</p>									</div>
