					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to get Kamikaze stable on an Asus WL-500gP. I get segfaults and some other problems with Kamikaze 7.07.

When looking in the trac bug reports, I stumbled upon this issue <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2035">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2035</a> and some others that indicate that there are severe problems with this platform and Kamikaze.</p><p>So now my question is what to do for a unit that should have production quality OS _now_. </p><p>1) My guess is that I will be safe with 7.07 and the BRCM 2.4 kernel.

					<p>I upgraded my WL500gP from Kamikaze 7.07 to 7.09 and it is more stable, but I still have a problem that about half the time when it boots up it doesn&#039;t detect my USB memory stick. I use the 500gP as a web server with my web site loaded on the USB stick so it&#039;s not that great at recovering from a power outage or spike.</p><p>If you really want a stable production OS, then White Russian might your best choice.</p><p>Rob</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>robrob</strong> on 21 Oct 2007, 00:53)</p>

					<p>I kept my same source tree (being 7.07 with some additional packages from the archive) and selected the 2.4 kernel. That works fine for now. Hope that the ebtables stuff was also fine in 2.4.xx as I need that.<br />My guess is that some programs still die with 7.09 and a 2.6 kernel. So the reason why your USB stick isn&#039;t reliably detected can be caused by that.</p>									</div>
