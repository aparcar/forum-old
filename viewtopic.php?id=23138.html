					<p>I started to write a patch about the same problem for some weeks ago and have some solution with setting uci parameters and adding things to hostapd.sh as Hellbore described. rts/cts threshold and dtim are also included</p><p>I haven&#039;t tested anything yet, and have not the code here.

					<p>Would rts and or beacon interval play an important part of the client&#039;s connection when using ath9k? For example, after running the R2N card in AP mode for x amount of time it appears I cannot assoicate with the signal using a wide range of laptop&#039;s and handheld devices. The device and openwrt appear to continue running fine with no signs of errors onboard. It just fails to allow association from new clients and appears to also drop current connections, upon reboot this clears up. I&#039;m looking into it, but iwconfig appears to show RTS on, however I don&#039;t recall setting that option in either the /etc/config/wireless file or even manually as explained here. Also the beacon interval you mention, don&#039;t see that setting in the hostapd conf file that is running. Does it default to something or is that important to set as well. Last but not least, I see mention of setting 16dbm, is it actually confirmed that applying either manual with iwconfi/iw or placing an entry in the wirless config file sets the transmit power proper? I do see a number change when altering the dbm from 27 to 20, but have not been able to determine if it&#039;s actually lowering the power.</p><p>I&#039;m using compat wireless from mid December if that helps, along with hostapd 0.7 that&#039;s pretty up to date. Just trying to isolate what could keep something from associating wtih an AP after what appears to be a random amount of time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>foxtroop11</strong> on 20 Jan 2010, 08:06)</p>

					<p>I seem to be suffering from a similar problem on a WRT54GL v1.1 (Broadcom wireless) running the Kernel 2.4 flavor of Kamikaze v8.09.2. Wireless becomes extremely unstable for streaming and ping becomes unreliable whenever AP and client are in different rooms. Other access points work just fine under the same circumstances, so I&#039;m suspecting the hidden node problem.</p><p>In White Russian fragmentation and RTS thresholds can be set through NVRAM variables but I don&#039;t see how this works in Kamikaze (v8.09.2). According to the docs madwifi has &quot;frag&quot; and &quot;rts&quot; options in its &quot;wifi-iface&quot; sections but the broadcom implementation does not. (I tried it out, too, just to be on the safe side and it really doesn&#039;t work.)</p><p>So what can I do to set frag and RTS thresholds? The iw command is not available on my system and I have no idea if it would even work with Broadcom&#039;s proprietary drivers. Any help or pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>
