					<p>Hi, I recently bought the book &#039;Linksys WRT54G Ultimate Hacking&#039;, a WRT54GL, &amp; goodies for the SD card &amp; serial port hacks. I know these are ageing products but having minimal experience I hoped to establish a modified device quickly using the guide.</p><p>Following the book I upgraded the firmware, made some configuration changes including X-WRT which swallowed the remaining memory. Some rash commands lead me to find &amp; figure a parallel port, make a &#039;Hairy Dairy Maid&#039; de-brick cable, re-flash cfe &amp; nvram, then tftp a new kernel.</p><p>I telnetted into the router and set the ssh password but can&#039;t log back in?</p><p>I can login with fail-safe mode but I get &#039;Read-only file system&#039; warnings?</p><p>I have reloaded the Linksys firmware which works fine.</p><p>I have used the Linksys firmware upgrade facility to re-re-install OpenWrt White Russian 0.9 but still cannot write to the file system?</p><p>root@(none):/# mount<br />/dev/root on / type squashfs (ro)<br />none on /dev type devfs (rw)<br />none on /proc type proc (rw)<br />none on /tmp type tmpfs (rw)</p><p>root@(none):/etc# echo Try to change something &gt; banner<br />/bin/ash: cannot create banner: Read-only file system</p><p>I can make &amp; save changes in the web browser GUI!</p><p>I know this is old stuff but I hope the knowledgeable may sympathize, thanks - Alex.</p>									</div>

					<p>Once you set passwd via telnet, telnet is disabled and you will have to connect with ssh. Read only file system in failsafe mode is normal, don&#039;t worry it. Just set the password, reboot and &quot;telnet&quot; to ssh port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks nozombian - I have spent a long time arranging the de-brick, I haven&#039;t used ssh before OpenWrt &amp; completely forgot to add the &#039;root@&#039; in the command &#039;ssh root@192.168.etc.etc&#039;. It&#039;s been a dumb waste of time for me but your message helped - embarrassed thanks again, Alex.</p>									</div>
