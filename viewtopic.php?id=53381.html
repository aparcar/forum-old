					<p>Yes. You most likely have a redundant &quot;option gateway&quot; on your lan interface. Remove it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, let me explain this precisely. If I set the gateway of lan&nbsp; to any address, the wan (in the Status&gt;Overview:network) will show the br-lan status, including setting it to itself. By leaving it out, the overview shows nothing about br-lan. But no matter what I set it , the default gateway of the connected client&nbsp; will be not changed just the address of lan.&nbsp; How could this happen?</p>									</div>

					<p>By adding &quot;option gateway&quot; to the lan you effectively isntall a 2nd default route which will confuse LuCI. You usually should have only one default route which is pointing to the wan interface.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes. Lan and wan are just names on openwrt, in contrast to other firmwares where they&#039;re treated sepecially in the gui.</p>									</div>
