					<p>Hi boyz, <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>on an external location (a buddy of me) I&#039;ve installed my old WRT54GS with BB r41665 as an access-point only. It is connected with a Fritz!Box (the Fritz!Box is the router) via LAN (on LAN1). When he plugs in his Laptop directly into the Linksys he get&#039;s an IP from the Fritz!Box in between seconds. When he trys it via WiFi he never get&#039;s an IP. Firewall and dnsmasq are disabled on the Linksys.</p><p>The configuration: WiFi: same SSID, same WPA2-PW but different channel than on the Fritz!Box. Connection to it seems to work. What kind of config-files do you need to see where&#039;s my mistake?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/config/dhcp
