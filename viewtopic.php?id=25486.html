					<p>I am trying to load this device. But I am having problems. Sorry if this is the wrong place.</p><p>The 330g will not go into failsafe mode from stock Asus f/w - The power led goes into the 1 sec on/off routine but the ethernet led never comes on. I assume it should as on my 330ge it does.</p><p>It won&#039;t ping or anything else as far as I can see. When in this state the Asus utilities can&#039;t find it either so I assume the port is not awake.</p><p>This left using the web interface ...... I have put the trx through the firmware_tools &quot;fixer&quot; and renamed it to *.bin. As soon as I try to upload that the browser says &quot;sending request to 192.168.1.1&quot; and just sits there - No upgrading screen. Also the wireless led flashes like crazy but the ethernet one is steady. It is also now unreachable until a power cycle.</p><p>I am pretty fed up with these boxes :-( I needed an OS agnostic wifi adapter and it seemed good but as you most likely know it can&#039;t do WPA2 correctly. I bought a 330ge because it can, only to find that the clowns have dropped the &quot;clone MAC address&quot; feature! Even though the manual says you need it for some applications.</p><p>Any suggestions to get either working correctly on WPA2 *and* with MAC cloning are very welcome.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>
