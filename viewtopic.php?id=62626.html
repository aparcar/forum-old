					<p>If you use imagebuilder without specifying a target device it should build an image for it.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to work out how to build an image just for the WT3020 (could just be me and not having enough time to figure it out properly).</p><p>This will mean that building an image takes longer as it has to build about 20 of them (that you won&#039;t use) but at least you get one out of it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Darn, I lost the third one now.<br />I guess for this build, the default must be to disable ssh services because it&#039;s able to pick up an IP and I *could* get to it IF it had any services running.

					<p>Have you tried the pre-built images? Do you know for sure that it&#039;s an H-model or if you have a 4Mb version or the 8Mb version?</p><p>From wiki:<br />1. Download <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/ramips/mt7620/openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-8M-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … actory.bin</a><br />2. Connect to the WLAN &quot;NEXX_…&quot;, no password is needed or connect via LAN cable (preferred)<br />3. Go to <a href="http://192.168.8.1">http://192.168.8.1</a> → Username: admin, Password: admin, System Setting → Upgrade Firmware<br />4. Select the openwrt-15.05-ramips-mt7620-wt3020-8M-squashfs-factory.bin image and press &quot;Upgrade&quot;<br />5. After a while, you will get &quot;Rebooting… System reboot takes a few moment, you might need to reconnect to the Router after rebooting.&quot;<br />6. After the system comes up, you should be able to log-in via LuCI at <a href="http://192.168.1.1/.">http://192.168.1.1/.</a></p><p>AFAIK by default the WiFi is disabled in OpenWrt so you&#039;d have to connect to your router over ethernet for initial config and to bring wifi up.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t fix the problem but I have a suggestion for an alternative approach.</p><p>I&#039;d start by building an image *without* any of your own changes/additions to make sure you&#039;re building the correct images.</p><p>Then, instead of bundling the actual config files in your image you can try creating a uci-defaults script.</p><p>First flash the router with the original openwrt image and start working on a script (of uci set/uci commit commands) to achieve your desired configuration. Once you confirm the script works on the original openwrt image you can then make it a uci-defaults script. </p><p>Better yet (well, might be safer if you don&#039;t know how to recover your routers) instead of making the script a uci-defaults, invoke the call of the script from /etc/rc.local (before the exit 0 line) and in your script make sure it sleeps for a minute to let the router fully start up and deletes itself after first run. That way even if you mess things up in the script you won&#039;t be stuck in the boot loop afaik.</p><p>Good luck!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stangri</strong> on 7 Apr 2016, 05:20)</p>

					<p>I have one already but cannot afford to spend that amount of time on each unit I need to get set up. Instead, it&#039;s quicker to order more and move on to another task while asking questions here and hoping someone in the forums can help me.
