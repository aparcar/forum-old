					<p>How do I remove packages that were installed only to satisfy other packages dependencies, which have since been removed?&nbsp; Using apt-get, it was as simple as &quot;apt-get autoremove&quot;.&nbsp; Apparently the autoremove functionality of opkg only works on a per-package basis.&nbsp; This does not help me as I can not remember all of the packages I have installed and uninstalled.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I suppose I only need help *identifying* orphaned packages.</p><p>Theres a few ways to go about this, for example, instead of identifying specifically orphaned packages, I could identify all packages set as manually installed or installed as a dependency of another package.&nbsp; If installed as a dependency of another package which is no longer present, then that would probably be an orphaned package.</p><p>Id rather not do a reset.</p>									</div>

					<p>I still am unsure of how to tell what packages I have installed that were auto-installed and now no longer needed.&nbsp; I do not want to just run &quot;firstboot&quot; because I have a fair amount of configuration I do not want to lose.&nbsp; I would not mind removing all software except for the packages and configuration involved in using my USB port as WAN.&nbsp; I am out of space on my router even though I have very few packages installed.&nbsp; </p><p>I even had a backup image that I did after getting my USB WAN working, but surprisingly, loading it did not result in the same amount of free space as when the image was generated.</p><p>Can someone please tell me my options?&nbsp; Again I do not want to use &quot;firstboot&quot; because I do not want to lose my working USB WAN.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
