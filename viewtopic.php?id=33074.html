					<p>I recently bought a WRT54G with the intention of putting OpenWRT on it only to discover upon its arrival that it already has White Russian 0.9 (JFFS2) on it... and I can not log in.&nbsp; When I enter failsafe mode and telnet in, passwd excepts a password, but it always gives a&nbsp; &quot;passwd: cannot update password file /etc/passwd&quot; response.&nbsp; I used &#039;vi etc/passwd&#039; to see if the file was corrupted. The file reads like this:</p><p>root:!:0:0:root:/tmp:/bin/ash<br />nobody:*:65534:65534:nobody:/var:/bin/false</p><p>The only other solution I have been able to find is using constant ping to time the boot_wait and re-imaging.</p><p>I am completely new to routers and would like to avoid that if at all possible.</p><p>If anyone has any ideas about what I may be doing wrong, things to try, topics to search for, anything at all, I would be greatly appreciative.</p><p>Thanks,<br />-Milch</p>									</div>
