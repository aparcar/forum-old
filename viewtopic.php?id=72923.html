					<p>I have ZBT-WE1626 connected to another router in cable in one of the LAN ports. The other router is connected to WAN. The ZBT-WE1626 in used to provide wifi access. My problem is that I cannot set a password for the wifi. And even when I somehow manage to set the password, then after power-off and power-on, again the wifi network starts open, without password.</p><p>Here&#039;s what I do:<br />Network--&gt; Wifi --&gt; edit (my wifi network)</p><p>Interface Configuration:<br />General Setup:&nbsp; ESSID myWifi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mode: Access Point<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Network: lan&nbsp; (selected)</p><p>Wireless Security: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption WPA-PSK/EPA2-PSK Mixed Mode<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Key&nbsp; myPassword</p><p>save&amp;apply </p><p>Encyption changed to mixed WPA/WPA2 PSK (TKIP, CCMP)<br />but wireless security&nbsp; is :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cipher auto<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Key admin</p><p>And if I do poweroff and poweron (by disconnecting and reconnecting power)<br />then it goes back to open network with no password.</p><p>Any idea what to do?<br />I couldn&#039;t find a manual for this router. I got only a quick installation guide from the chinese<br />seller in aliexpress. <br />I am not an expert, although I have some technical skills.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
