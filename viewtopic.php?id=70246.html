					<p>Hey Guys - </p><p>I&#039;ve been using OpenWRT for a few years now and love it as using it has added the ability to add so many features to my otherwise plain-jane routers not to mention stability.</p><p>After getting fiber a few days ago, I decided it was also time for an upgrade to my primary router at home.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t seem right to have internet that is faster than your local wifi. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; I replaced my old BUffalo WZR-600DHP (which still wasn&#039;t that bad) with a new Linksys WRT1900ACS.&nbsp; While waiting for it to arrive, I downloaded all OpenWRT files I&#039;d need to install it.</p><p>After setting the new router up yesterday, I was playing in the OEM firmware but actually found that it seemed to be the best and most feature-rich OEM one I had used yet.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using it for about 24 hours now and actually kindof like it - but - miss OpenWRT.</p><p>So... my question is - besides the thousands of packages OpenWRT offers <em>(most of which I do not use)</em>, what would you guys consider the main reasons to proceed with installing / using OpenWRT over the OEM Linksys firmware?&nbsp; Previously, I mostly used it for OpenVPN, guest network, and a few other options that OEM firmwares mostly didn&#039;t offer - but now it does.&nbsp; </p><p>The main priority for me is performance, wireless speed, &amp; range so whatever is better at that is probably what I&#039;d go with.&nbsp; The range of the WRT1900ACS is already about 20% better than the prior router, but that&#039;s probably just hardware.&nbsp; Know I might be able to overclock or add more power to WiFi using OpenWRT, but don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth it or safe.&nbsp; I actually tried a build of OpenWRT on a new Archer C5 router I got about a year ago and AC <em>(never tried overclocking it)</em> never really worked correctly.&nbsp; To be fair, I believe support for AC was in development at that time; but didn&#039;t know how it fared currently.</p><p>If it helps, I currently have about 25 devices <em>(~20 are wireless - 5Ghz when supported)</em> on my home network which now uses a 250Mbps fiber for it&#039;s source/WAN.&nbsp; The biggest LAN users are my primary PC and primary Kodi PC.&nbsp; Kodi is <em>(now)</em> connected via 5Ghz AC <em>(650Mbps)</em> to my primary PC <em>(ethernet)</em> which hosts all of it&#039;s content as well as many other things.&nbsp; Next would be a Roku box <em>(wireless)</em> that my wife uses to play Gilmore Girls literally all night long <em>(whole different topic <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />)</em> via Plex hosted on primary PC.</p><p>So - any thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks for taking the time to read and comment!!</p>									</div>

					<p>Use the firmware you most like and does what you need it to do.<br />You can always install both, since the WRT1900ACS has 2 partitions and boot the one you want to use at that moment.<br />I use LEDE myself.</p>									</div>
