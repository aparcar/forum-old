					<p>hi</p><p>has any got the speex codec working with Kamikaze ?</p><p>when I tried to load a dynamic module that is linked against libspeex.so it fails<br />with &quot;unresolved symbol logf&quot;.</p><p>the symbol &quot;logf&quot; is provided by libm (Math library) which is present on my<br />device:</p><p>/rom/lib/libm-0.9.28.so</p><p>I also check that the build process actually contains &quot;-lm&quot; when linking<br />the libspeex.so. Could it be that the libspeex.so is linked against a different<br />libm which is not on the device?</p><p>Is there a similar command to &quot;ldd&quot; so check which libraries an ELF file<br />is linking to?</p><p>I tried to build the latest Speex from subverion and that work much better.</p><p>The following configure parameters was used:</p><p> $ ./configure --enable-fixed-point --host=mipsel-linux-uclibc CFLAGS=-lm</p><br /><p>so it would be very interesting to see if anyone else actually has speex<br />working at all with kamikaze (e.g. with Asterisk)..</p><br /><p>thanks,</p><p>Alfred</p>									</div>
