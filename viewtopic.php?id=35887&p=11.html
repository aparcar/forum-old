					<p>First off, thanks for the great work on this custom build! My old MIPSR1-based router (with various firmwares over the years, including OpenWrt) just couldn&#039;t cut it any more after my recent speed upgrade. After trying and discarding various x86 distros, I settled on pfsense -- IPv6 (in the 2.1 beta), multiple DDNS-provider support, flexible rules. Unfortunately, the DHCP server seemed to conflict with my VOIP ATA which would fail to refresh its SIP server registration.</p><p>But your build works flawlessly and is painless to install (and I agree that the default x86 OpenWrt build leaves a lot to be desired), so thank you for your hard work.</p><p>Second, this has less to do with your build and more to do with OpenWrt driver support, but the SiS900 driver is bugged. It goes into a continuous loop of up/down at boot, never making it to the login. I got around this by using an Intel adapter I had laying around instead. I realize that this may not matter to you since: A. SiS is out of the chipset business; B. none of their motherboard chipsets ever supported SMP cpus. But there may be others like me who repurpose old hardware, so it&#039;s probably information you should have.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been thinking about ways of getting various network monitors on a display in my room, without adding more PCs.</p><p>I first tried my NAS box but I seem to be having problems either getting the signal all the way to where I want it, or there is something wrong with the graphics driver, as I am getting huge graphical corruption when I fire up Xorg.</p><p>Next, I tried a cheap Android tablet, but that seems to work for so long and then the feed freezes.&nbsp; I have tried various different web browsers, none of them are reliable on this particular tablet.&nbsp; I tried a few Xorg servers with the application itself running on my NAS box, but they just crash too.</p><p>So that leaves me with only one spare device, my router.</p><p>Being a dual-core Atom, its not really doing a lot the majority of the time.&nbsp; Its sat there with a HDMI port on the back, completely unused.&nbsp; That seems like such a waste.</p><p>So while looking around for a solution I stumbled onto this: <a href="http://www.netsurf-browser.org/downloads/">http://www.netsurf-browser.org/downloads/</a></p><p>This sounds ideal as if the JavaScript support is mature enough it could even allow you access to LuCI, which is extremely useful if you messed up the network configuration and aren&#039;t 100% sure which files you need to be editing to fix it.</p><p>I would try compiling it myself but looking at your instructions above my eyes start to gloss over, it sounds overly complicated having to fiddle around with two different build directories to build a single release.&nbsp; So I thought I would document my findings here as its likely you would be able to give it a try far quicker than I would.&nbsp; Although I must try compiling your build myself at some point, as I would be interested to see if I can build an X server for the router as well to see if it would be light enough to use as the output from my NAS box without killing the routing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Power management was disabled on the build as it caused compatibility problems with some network cards (most notably, the one on my Intel DN2800MT board) and generally is not advised for a router anyway as it causes latency spikes when devices wake up, when the CPU frequency is changed, etc.&nbsp; It might be a very small amount of latency, but for a router you want it as responsive as possible.</p><p>Also we found it made no measurable difference to heat or power consumption, if the machine is otherwise mostly idle anyway.</p>									</div>
