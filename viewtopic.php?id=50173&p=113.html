					<p>Interesting note. I decided to flash to McWRT. I wanted to start fresh though so I flashed to the stock Linksys first. Once the image was installed, I noticed all my original settings were stored. Everything, wifi SSID, routing tables, everything. I wonder if this could have caused issues? So I did a factory restore, and have gone back to the latest Kaloz build. We&#039;ll see if that cures the issue...</p>									</div>

I use a Synology NAS as my syslog server. Looks like there&#039;s a nasty bug in the latest version that precludes used from reading the logs from external devices. I can see the last 50 syslog entries that the server receives, but I can&#039;t search for a specific device and export the log file. I had to try and parse out the data from the actual .db file. It was ugly. As far as the router is concerned, simply point the syslog to your server ip and port and reboot. That&#039;s the only hang up I had. There&#039;s no indication that a reboot is required, but it is. Otherwise it&#039;ll keep looking for the old syslog server. There may be a way to recycle the syslog service, but I couldn&#039;t find it.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can check daily progress here: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/timeline">https://dev.openwrt.org/timeline</a> (this doesn&#039;t include luci and a few other things that have repositories elsewhere) I don&#039;t believe the wifi driver has had any updates yet.</p><p>The automatic daily build was broken for a while, first because there was a missing symbol in the mvebu kernel config, and then because a few netfilter modules weren&#039;t being packaged properly. Both were recently resolved, and now you will be seeing a brand new build (including packages) built every day from the latest source.</p><p>@srkn editing the config file shouldn&#039;t be necessary anymore. The builds people are using here apparently predate the change, but anyone using the daily snapshot build can just use &#039;opkg update&#039; and &#039;opkg install luci&#039;</p>									</div>

I can flash CC and configure and it runs fine as long as I don&#039;t do an upgrade. The minute the upgrade happens or I restore a backup that was done it takes a few hours and then the lockup of the router happens. I believe there is something software related going on here. </p><p>If it was hardware, then the stock linksys firmware would have the same issue or CC would after I flash and configure and it does not. Been running that fine for almost a week after flashing back to the stock linksys and restoring the backup.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dpdurst</strong> on 3 Feb 2015, 17:58)</p>
