					<p>(This is the same post as I made on X-Wrt forum)</p><p>Hi, I am using OpenWRT for a while now, and now I&#039;m using the X-Wrt extensions too. I am using my WL-5500GP as router, firewall and download client and datastore. So I am using samba to get access with windows clients. I searched a way to get aMule working on OpenWRT, and I found a Tutorial on it. (<a href="http://eko.one.pl/index.php?page=openwrt-amule">http://eko.one.pl/index.php?page=openwrt-amule</a>).</p><p>I searched a while for a webif for ctorrent, I found webifs for ctorrent, but ctorrent is very buggy and very old. So I found enhanced-ctorrent in Unslung packages, that can be used for OpenWRT too. (<a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Optware/EnhancedCTorrent">http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Optware … edCTorrent</a>)<br />But I could not find a webif for OpenWRT. So I searched other websites and I found one for Oleg&#039;s firmware, made by Seaky.</p><p>Yesterday I tried to install it on OpenWRT and It worked with only one change in the start script. You can find more info about Seaky&#039;s CTCS on his webpage (http://sctcs.seaky.hu/). Download it, and install it using ipkg.<br />Seaky is providing detailed infos about configuring his webif (he wrote an install pdf, downloadable from his webpage). The only file to config is /opt/etc/sctcs.conf</p><p>After you configured that, make two changees in /opt/etc/init.d/S90sctcs<br />Find BUSYBOX_HTTPD and change it to:<br />BUSYBOX_HTTPD=/usr/sbin/httpd</p><p>and in function stop()<br />killall busybox_httpd has to be changed to killall httpd</p><p>So that it is using the correct httpd. After that change you can launch the script by /opt/etc/init.d/S90sctcs start and it should work, you should have access trough the browser on the port specified by you in the config.</p><p>I found this the best way to control torrents, it is the webif using the better client ;-)</p><p>Greetz<br />fireandy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fireandy</strong> on 19 Mar 2007, 03:43)</p>

					<p>I dont think it is possible to really use ctorrent without swap.</p><p>For a working version without all kinds of dependency issues, and with explanation on using screen to use ctorrent in the background, I have made a tutorial here:<br /><a href="http://www.macsat.com/macsat/content/view/34/30/">http://www.macsat.com/macsat/content/view/34/30/</a></p><p>The version used isnt excately new, but it works great at my place on a WL-500G Deluxe with an attached harddrive and swap enabled.</p><p>You can always create swap in a file on your disk / SD-card instead of creating a real partition - but you really do need to swap.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>macsat</strong> on 12 Apr 2007, 11:54)</p>

					<p>Hey macsat, nice to read something written by you in here. I like youre tutorials, you are one of the guys who brought me OpenWRT near...I learned a lot with this kind of support - with tutorials. Thanks for that.</p><p>The problem with your ctorrent is, that it isn`t accepted by all trackers, so I needed something better / newer... thatswhy I used enhanced ctorrent with this nice webif I found.</p><p>But currently I am testing around with additonal debian installation on hdd to let run mlonkey, that would be a target for me..</p>									</div>

					<p>The one from my site is enhanced ctorrent, even if I write ctorrent on the pages.
