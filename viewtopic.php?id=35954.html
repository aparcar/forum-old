					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have tried to install the ar7 port using the squash image file for this router on mtd 4 but it justs bricks it. It has a adam2 bootloader and can access it no problem.</p><p>I tried a router recovery tool that allowed me to unbrick it using the official firmware. This is a single file but when i tried to use the openwrt image it says this is a kernal only image and I need to specify a filesystem image also.</p><p>Is there a version of openwrt that is in 2 parts? Filesystem and kernal image?</p><p>cheers,</p><p>Spikeyhair.</p><p>PS I have done a search on here for anything dsl 320 related but cant find anything.</p>									</div>
