					<p>I&#039;ve been a contributor to wikidevi since early 2013.&nbsp; All email I have from them has a reply to reply@no.possible and has links to contact the editor at a URL on wikidevi.&nbsp; Which if the website is down leaves no way to contact anyone!!!&nbsp; I&#039;m not very happy if all my contributions are now useless!&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve spent many hours tearing apart different systems, looking up the chips and documenting them on wikidevi.&nbsp; I never thought to keep copies of the information for myself in case the website ever disappeared!</p><p>Ray</p>									</div>
