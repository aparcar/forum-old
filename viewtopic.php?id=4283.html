					<p>Hi all,<br />I&#039;ve had lots of troubles getting openwrt-kamikaze to work on the NetGear WGT634U, but I&#039;ve come up with some fixes. These may not be the &#039;proper&#039; fixes, but they work in getting the WAN interface working for dhcp.</p><p>First, make sure you have the WAN cable plugged into the proper port. This changes around with different revisions. It&#039;s either the port closest to the antenna or the port closest to the power connector.</p><p>Second, make sure your CFE settings are set to be compatible with OpenWRT:</p><p>&nbsp; setenv -p STARTUP &quot;ifconfig eth0 -auto;boot -elf flash0.os:&quot;</p><p>Trying to use a static IP address here, or not configuring the ethernet port at all, will result in a garbled MAC address and bad ethernet behavior because of it.</p><p>Thirdly, there is currently a bug in the startup scripts relating to the detection of the WGT634U. You may have to change /etc/init.d/S05netconfig, where it says ELF change to DR0.</p><p>Lastly, I had a problem because my WAN was numbered 192.168.1.0/24, as is the default settings of OpenWRT&#039;s LAN addresses. This causes problems. So, keep this in mind if you are having troubles: you may have to renumber the OpenWRT LAN IP addresses.</p>									</div>
