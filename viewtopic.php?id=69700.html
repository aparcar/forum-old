					<p>Hallo to everyone.</p><p>My Linksys EA4500 is dead, after 4 years of good job (many of the with OpenWrt) seems stopped working, maybe I&#039;ll try to debrick with usb-ttl cable, but now I need a new router to use with OpenWRT.</p><p>I&#039;m looking for Gigabit, 5Ghz + 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi with multi-ssid capability, obviously OpenWRT support. The router also perform as NAT (mobile hard drive attached) and has to manage well 5 PCs in Wi-Fi, some smartphones, Sky decoder, 3 PCs in GigaBit, running firewall and an aggressive QoS (one of the 2 WiFi is for guests and tenants), and has to be a VPN server with 2 o 3 clients.<br />EA4500 was often with 75% average load, in certain moments 100% and the network got very slow: I had to power off it and wait some minutes... I&#039;ve known for some time that an improvement was needed!</p><p>Now I&#039;m using my old WRT54GL with DD-WRT witch I was in use for the box networking for basic domestic use, but I need a substitute.<br />Looking at the <em>ToH special: Gbit, Dualband, 802.11ac, OpenWrt supported</em>, <em>Filtered by availability*~Available &amp; supported current rel*~15.05 &amp; ram mb*~</em> I&#039;m thinking about WRT-1200AC, but I&#039;m here to get some suggestions.</p><p>Budget is around 150 Euros.<br />Thanks in advice.</p>									</div>
