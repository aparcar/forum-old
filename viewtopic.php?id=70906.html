					<p>Hi,</p><p>That pretty much says it all.<br />I have a new installation on a tplink wdr3600.</p><p>i can the address of my computer statically, and everything is fine, i.e. i can talk to the router and all my traffic is forwarded properly, i.e. i can get out the internet.</p><p>But nothing on the network, whether wired or wireless, can get an IP address.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what I should post to help debug this, but everything I can check seems to indicate that DHCP is running.</p><p>Any ideas ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes you should remove the ra server and dhcpv6 server options in a fully v4 system.&nbsp; That causes confusion with some clients, but it generally doesn&#039;t completely stop it from working.&nbsp; Otherwise the default configuration should work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your help.</p><p>I did what you suggested and still have the same problem.</p><p>This is definitely an IPV6 related issue.&nbsp; When I disabled IPV6 on the windows box, even though i had the static IPV4 address set, my route to the internet broke.&nbsp; enabling IPV6 fixed it.</p><p>the thing i find strange is that i have the br-lan interface set to static IPV4 but it&#039;s still showing an IPV6 address.</p><p>my windows box is also showing up as an IPV6 lease on the status page, even though dhcp IPV6&nbsp; is now disabled.</p><p>i also have a wan6 interface set-up as a dhclient.&nbsp; Something I did not do, it was there by default:</p>									</div>

					<p>ok. that was weird.</p><p>i made sure that everything ipv6 was disabled.</p><p>still can&#039;t get dhcp assignments, so I do what you always do in these situations, power-cycled the router.</p><p>after it booted up, everything worked fine.</p>									</div>
