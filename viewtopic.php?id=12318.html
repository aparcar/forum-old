					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve a Asus WL-500g Premium router with White Russian installed. My broadband service has recently been upgraded to 20 mb/s but I&#039;m still only getting 10 mb/s. The Asus router specs say it has a &#039;Bit Rate 10/100 Mbps&#039;, now I would presume that it would automatically run at 100 mbps if that speed is necessary, but we all know what presumption is. How do I check which speed is set and how do I change it? I can&#039;t find this info. in the docs/wiki and simply have no idea how to do this.</p><p>Many thanks to all you OpenWRT gurus.</p><p>mattstan</p>									</div>
