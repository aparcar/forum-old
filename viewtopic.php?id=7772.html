					<p>I&#039;ve had a few people ask me about this, and I&#039;ve been interested in it for some time myself. Finally, its done..</p><p>It was a simple task to port buildroot-ng&#039;s busybox 1.2.1 and patches to a White Russian compatible package. The result is in the X-Wrt package repository and svn source repository. It seems to perform quite well, though the applet configuration needs a little adjustment still since it doesn&#039;t match up perfectly with White Russian&#039;s busybox 1.0.0 applet config (I&#039;ve included too many things). I&#039;ll periodically make new releases that have a more ideal applet configuration.</p><p>Busybox 1.2.1 adds numerous features and bug fixes over Busybox 1.0.0 used in White Russian RC5 and RC6. It does not add any bloat afaik, as they keep a close eye on such things.</p><p>I do not recommend anyone go ipkg upgrade or install this, particularly on squashfs images... though I suppose you could. It&#039;s really meant for use with the image builder. It will be included by default on all pre-built images of OpenWrt distributed by the X-Wrt project.</p><p>The obvious question is <strong>why keep updating White Russian??</strong> In fact, the answer is that I am not going to continue to do this indefinitely. Buildroot-ng is indeed the future.</p><p>X-Wrt stuff is here: <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/xwrt/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/xwrt/</a> . You&#039;ll find the package repository in the ftp area and the source repository in the svn area.</p>									</div>

					<p>No problem. </p><p>I posted 1.2.1_5 after I posted that. I think the config is pretty much right, though obviously everyone has different preferences. I did include the new &#039;fakeidentd&#039; applet because I personally use it and the size increase is marginal; that is perhaps the only thing that maybe shouldn&#039;t be there. I&#039;ve been using 1.2.1 with WR pre-RC6 for several days now and have seen no problems, only benefits.</p><p>I posted some pre-built OpenWrt pre-RC6 images in the X-Wrt ftp area, though they are very, very rough. They include Busybox 1.2.1, qos-scripts (and all dependencies), libncurses, webif^2, and a few other things. Eventually I&#039;ll have these pre-built images polished up and those who prefer to not use the image builder can use these.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s simply an identd, like used for irc. identd is a service which basically just tells a remote system who you are (or claim to be).</p>									</div>

The size addition to busybox was minimal, particularly after compression. So, for those who are interested in using multi-user stuff with White Russian, this Busybox package is for you. </p><p>With regards to multi-user stuff, it appears so far that it all works well. One thing is that you shouldn&#039;t absolutely depend on a non-root user not being able to get root access, since its possible Busybox has buffer overflows in it that could give a user the ability to escalate their privilidges. There are no exploits I know of,&nbsp; but for the paranoid, I mention this concern that nbd originally mentioned to me.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m also not so sure about how well it will run on my new WL500gP and if it supports WL on it.
