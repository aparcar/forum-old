					<p>How do you get OpenWRT to redirect http traffic to https traffic?<br />I believe I was successful in getting the firewall forward rule to change traffic to the router&#039;s IP at port 80 over to port 443 from the router&#039;s webserver&#039;s perspective.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, that does not tell one&#039;s browser to start sending traffic over SSL protocol so what the webserver (Luci specifically) sees is unencrypted traffic on port 443, which it rejects.</p><p>So, how does one get Luci to switch over to SSL when one connects to her via non-ssl?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think that LuCI could do it better - autodetect the hostname and direct login to HTTPS.</p>									</div>
