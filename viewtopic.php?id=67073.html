					<p>Mo&#039; logs, mo&#039; problems, as they (probably don&#039;t) say.</p><p>First, regarding DNS, that was entirely user error. I didn&#039;t realize that the settings pushed to clients are not necessarily the same as the override on the WAN interface. Which seems obvious in hindsight. With that solved, the rest remains mysterious.</p><p>I set my public IP to static, copying the settings from what it received from DHCP. So far so good. Can browse, ping, all that. Set up a remote SSH connection to see if it would die as usual. It didn&#039;t, but, I can still see the link going down and coming back up in the logs, even though I don&#039;t lose SSH.</p><p>So... what appears to be happening is that when the link comes back up, it triggers DHCP, drops my IP for a split second, and thus kills my live connections. That doesn&#039;t really explain, though, why the link is going down in the first place. I&#039;m at a bit of a loss on that one. Anybody got any ideas? Otherwise I may just have to try DD-WRT or something. Which I&#039;d really rather not do.</p>									</div>

					<p>AR8316 auto-negotiation @ 1000Mbps issue (which is unrelated to OpenWrt).</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure I follow.</p><p>I Googled a number of variations of &quot;AR8316 auto-negotiation 1000mbps&quot; and didn&#039;t find much of interest. Now, the chipset that OpenWRT reports on my router is AR9280, while the documentation reports it should be AR7161. Not sure why that is, maybe I just have a newer model. But they&#039;re all Atheros, so let&#039;s say they&#039;re close enough to share some bugs.</p><p>I did find ticket 14120 on the bug tracker, which seems to be vaguely related. Sorry, it&#039;s not letting me post a link for some odd reason.</p><p>So I tried disabling VLANs. No change. Plus, that disabled NAT, and that&#039;s bad.</p><p>I wasn&#039;t able to find anything related specifically related to Atheros chipsets having auto-negotiation problems. I don&#039;t think the router is failing link negotiation as such. swconfig reports the following.</p><p>port:0 link:up speed:1000baseT full-duplex txflow rxflow</p><p>I do have connectivity, I just lose it a lot. Given that, is it still going to be an auto-negotation problem? Is it renegotiating after the link is up, and if so, why is it doing it so often?</p><p>Again, I was not able to find any known problem with this chipset that shares the symptoms I&#039;m experiencing. Assuming it is related to the chipset, what is the issue? Driver problem? Hardware problem? And what&#039;s the solution? Auto-negotiation is mandatory for gigabit links, so I can&#039;t just turn it off.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have absolutely no idea what you&#039;re trying to say. The exact search you posted returned nothing relevant in the first 3 pages aside from things I already said I tried.</p><p>My best guess is you&#039;re attempting to direct me to a chipset datasheet, in which I searched &quot;negotiation&quot;. But that only says how the process SHOULD work. From the parts I could understand, I still don&#039;t see any information on why it&#039;s not working or how to fix it. Fixing my WAN stability by reading about the low level link negotiation process in 300 page chipset datasheets, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re trying to get me to do, is beyond my ability</p><p>I&#039;ve posted logs, hardware information, and detailed attempts at fixing it myself. I can&#039;t find anyone else who has had the same problem, except one offhand mention by a guy on a blog post about auto-negotiation who couldn&#039;t fix his either. I think I&#039;ve done my due diligence. If you know how to fix it, please post it. Otherwise, hopefully someone else does.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t buy your explanation for the following reasons.</p><p>1.) If there were a general problem with an Atheros chipset running at gigabit, due to drivers or hardware or whatever else, there would be a million Google hits about it. There are basically none.<br />2.) As I said before, it wasn&#039;t failing auto-negotiation, it was losing the link several minutes later.<br />3.) I did another test on the LAN side, and the link is stable at a gig there.<br />4.) I fixed it, and it turned out to be something much, much stupider.</p><p>After even more testing, I observed 3 things. The LAN link is always stable, the WAN link is unstable at a gig, but IS stable when forced to 100 meg. For a minute it almost did look like an auto-negotiation problem, but no. Proceeding on that basis, what I found online is that improperly terminated cables can sometimes work and 100 and fail at 1000 due to more wire pairs being used and tighter tolerances at gig speeds. I actually had tried a few different cables on my side, but I hadn&#039;t thought about the ISP side.</p><p>I checked the termination on my end and it looked good. But just for the heck of it I called my ISP and explained the situation. Luckily I got a good tech who understood and agreed to have the other end of the cable checked out. They came out earlier today, reterminated the cable to the patch panel in the apartment building, and it&#039;s been solid as a rock ever since. No changes to the chipset or auto-negotiation settings.</p><p>So, while I feel it was right to thoroughly examine my own equipment before assuming the problem was with someone else&#039;s work, shame on me for overlooking layer 1. But even more shame on you for sending me off on a wild goose chase with your impenetrably terse amateur koans. The next time you want to snarkily lord your superior knowledge over someone, make sure you actually have some.</p>									</div>

					<p>1.) A link dying due to a bad cable is an auto-negotiation problem in the same way that a car engine overheating at high speeds is because of the transmission. That is to say, not at all. The start up process works, the problem is maintaining the speed, which is a completely different issue.<br />2.) You said twice that it&#039;s due to an auto-negotiation problem WITH THE CHIPSET. Which, again, it wasn&#039;t. At all.</p><p>You seem to have been accidentally right that it was a problem that only happened at certain link speeds, but your logic for getting there was completely wrong.</p>									</div>

					<p>Fine, forget the car analogy. I couldn&#039;t come up with a good one. It&#039;s not important anyway.</p><p>What is important that the fix was replacing the cable, and you&#039;re seriously still trying to tell me that it was a problem with the switch and that you were somehow right all along. It was not the chipset, it was not the auto-negotiation, and it was not the switch. It was the CABLE. The cable couldn&#039;t handle the gigabit speeds because it wasn&#039;t terminated correctly. The fact that it worked at 100 meg doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s &quot;really&quot; a switch problem. If the cable was replaced, and now it works at a gig, that means it was a cable problem and nothing else.</p>									</div>

					<p>Stop throwing crap at the wall and seeing if it sticks. You&#039;ve given absolutely no justification for why it would be a deadlock problem, because you&#039;re making vague guesses and hoping nobody notices. Auto-negotiation passed, meaning it didn&#039;t deadlock there. Auto-negotiation doesn&#039;t happen again after the link is already established, because that would be a waste of resources on a live link. The link went down later due to signal loss on a bad cable, and auto-negotation took place after that because the link was brought back up.</p><p>I&#039;m going to try one more time.
