					<p>Hello, </p><p>Please read the whole post. Thank You. <br />I&#039;m new to this forum - (I had Linksys WRT610Nv2 running DD-WRT Brainslayer build 2 years ago then TomatoUSB by Shibby). <br />I have little knowledge on networks. <br />I build 2 machines: <br />1-st Alix 2d2 (bridge) + Mikrotik R52Hn (Atheros 9220) to act as wireless bridge (My WISP is located 100m away). I have to connect WLAN to his access point (10.20.0.1) and pass the data throught LAN port. How to set this up as transparent bridge? <br />I set up WAN port with static IP as management port (to be connected to local network as 192.168.1.2)</p><p>2-nd Alix 2d2 (router) + Mikrotik R52Hn (Atheros 9220) + Mikrotik R52H (Atheros 5414) will get data on WAN (10.20.0.83) and pass it to BR0 (192.168.1.1 - LAN + AP 2.4GHz + AP 5GHz) </p><p>What I did is:<br />Set up bridge: connect to Wifi client, set WWLAN + LAN as bridge (no ip address)<br />Set up router: WAN as static ip, then AP 2.4GHz + AP 5GHz.<br />I have only one way connection (send not receive) on cable between router and bridge.</p><p>What to change if I get static public IP?</p><p>I use standard x86 ext2 image + ath5k and ath9k modules.<br />Is it better to compile by myself? If yes does anybody have working config?</p><p>Please welcome any comments and suggestions. </p><p>Maciek &#039;vobo&#039;</p>									</div>
