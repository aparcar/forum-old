					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to run both TAP and TUN daemons on my OpenWRT to connect my laptop on a TAP server and my IOS device on a TUN server. I&#039;ve created 2 conf files (one for each daemon: Openvpn.conf [TAP server] and Openvpn-TUN.conf [TUN server]) in /etc/config, but when I start Openvpn it only starts the openvpn.conf, so there is only my TAP server that is running.</p><p>Then, I suppose that I have to edit the /etc/init.d/openvpn file to force it to run the 2 daemons, but i&#039;ve no idea what I have to change. Can someone help me figure this out?</p><p>My /etc/init.d/openvpn file : textuploader. com/dduti</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

Openvpn had trouble autoloading .conf files with spaces or special characters.</p><p>Also, .conf files should be placed in /etc/openvpn/</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ExaltedVanguard</strong> on 1 Jan 2017, 18:22)</p>
