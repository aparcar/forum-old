					<p>I was wondering if anyone had some ideas on the best way to make a point-to-point link using openwrt.</p><p>I have RC4 on the main router (wrt54gs) with the vlan ports separated out (one wan port and vlan1 - vlan4)</p><p>I&#039;m just experimenting with the routing features and I am currently running each vlan with a x.x.x.252 subnet since each only has one other IP on each network.</p><p>Is there a better way to set up point-to-point links?</p>									</div>
