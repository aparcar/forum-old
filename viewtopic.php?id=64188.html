In my case the modem only has a 100Mbps interface towards the openwrt device and hence the negotiated wan speed is 100Mbps, but still PPPoE does not work (this is a DTAG link using the new BNG architecture)</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

My current theory is that this modem never adorned pppoe-passthough with VLAN-tags at all and that the older BRAS system Telekom used was permissive of that while the recent BNG system really really requires VLAN7-tags... The wndr3700 beautifully tags outgoing packets if configured thusly, but the modem will not accept tagged packets on its lan side...
