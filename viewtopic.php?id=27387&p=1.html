					<p>I still have problems setting up WDS.<br />The problem in detail is described <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=119482#p119482">here</a>.<br />I can also put it here again, if necessary.<br />In the meantime i switched the routers, but this also did not help. At the moment, the LinkSys router acts as the &quot;master&quot; AP and the Buffalo is the &quot;client&quot; STA. However, the effect is still the same, exactly as described.<br />Do i have to configure anything else? Firewall? I read half the Internet, but did not find anything.<br />All clients (notebooks) connect only to the &quot;master&quot;, no way, getting &quot;hand-over&quot; to work. And the &quot;client&quot; STA is not accessible from the clients (notebooks), except ping. LuCi doesn&#039;t load, ssh doesn&#039;t work. So what&#039;s wrong?<br />As ping works fine, i think, the general setup should be ok.<br />Any ideas? </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

Sysupgrade for the Buffalo went fine). So these are almost fresh installations without any additional packages installed.<br />After adding wlan0 and wlan0.sta to &#039;ifname&#039; on the AP and switching the firewall completely off on the STA, i was able to successfully connect to the STA from the notebook (with ~10 second delay for each request). Well. For about 5 minutes. After that, the connection stalled again. On the STA there was no interface called wlan0.sta. Only eth0 and wlan0. So i only added wlan0 to &#039;ifname&#039; on the STA.</p><p>Actually i have a printserver connected to the STA. It gets an ip-address from the AP (DHCP is disabled on the STA). I can ping this printserver from the notebook (sometimes) but very slow with more than 50% loss of packets.<br />I can successfully ping the printserver from the AP, but as soon as i try to access the configuration-website for the printserver (which never opens. surprise, surprise), the ping from the AP starts to lose packets and the respond time from the printserver increases.</p><p>So, i&#039;m out of ideas. I hope you&#039;re not.</p>									</div>
