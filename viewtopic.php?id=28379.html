					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have several same routers and I would like to be able to maintain the configuration files for hardware [network, wireless] and software [openvpn, firewall] on my build environment, so that when flashed it will work out of the box, without the need for me to go and change stuff in every one of them.</p><p>Although I can find software config under:<br />/staging_dir/target-mips_r2_uClibc-0.9.31/root-ar71xx/etc/config/firewall<br />[I hope this one is maintained through the builds if I don&#039;t do make clean]<br />for firewall for example, I have no clue where to find network and wireless configuration files.</p><p>This info would save me hours of manual config.<br />Creating archives of configuration and then copying it over to every router to unpack it is a pain in the a.. butt.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Krystian</p>									</div>

					<p>1)<br />The initial config files are either with &#039;base-files&#039; package, the device profile defconfig or with individual package sources.<br />E.g. /etc/config/network is firstly in /package/base-files/files/etc/config and then for most devices also in the device profile that overrides the base-files package. (In my case in Backfire branch that is /target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/defconfig/wndr3700/network )</p><p>In my own build, I have modified e.g.<br />/package/block-mount/files/fstab.config<br />/package/base-files/files/etc/openwrt_release<br />/package/base-files/files/etc/config/system<br />/package/base-files/files/etc/sysctl.conf<br />/package/firewall/files/firewall.user<br />/feeds/packages/ipv6/aiccu/files/aiccu.conf</p><p>So, the files are pretty much scattered around. Finding them takes some time.</p><p>2)<br />The other option (that I have not tested) is to create an new /files directory in your svn root, then create /etc/config there and place the config files there. These files should overwrite the ones generated in the individual packages.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=119001#p119001">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 01#p119001</a><br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/imagebuilder#files">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/imagebuilder#files</a></p><p>(Advantage of the first method is that the possible changes in the default files&#039; format get better reflected later. for example, the radvd module was upgraded a few days ago and its config files changed somewhat. If I had just overridden the new files with old ones, the changes would have gone unnoticed.)</p><p>EDIT: added note about device profile defconfig.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 29 Jan 2011, 15:24)</p>

					<p>Thanks hnyman,</p><p>I&#039;ve found network under base-files/files/etc/config directory but it is very much different from what I get in the end in my image.<br />Is it changed somewhere along the line?<br />I think I will try with the /files approach and see where I&#039;ll get with that.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just that example file that I used, /etc/config/network comes actually in my case from the device profile that overrides the base-files package... </p><p>In my case in Backfire branch that is: <br />/target/linux/ar71xx/base-files/etc/defconfig/wndr3700/network</p><p>Looks like I erred in my first message.</p>									</div>
