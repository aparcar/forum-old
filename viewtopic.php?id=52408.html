					<p>When you said you let JohnTheRipper run for a week was that on the Archer itself or on your PC? Also screw using the CPU for password cracking, you need GPU power for that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I like to use 3.5m stereo plugs for serial console cables. Much smaller just drill a nice small hole, and tighten the ring like a wifi antenna. </p><p>I use gnd where you would expect, the last pin, the middle one is tx, highest voltage and the tip is rx lowest voltage. Also it helps to turn off the router and and unplug the dku-5 (pl2303).</p><p>Why? Try fitting a mini/micro USB connector in a D-LINK DIR-505 A1. Good luck <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /> I could share pictures if you want. </p><p>I also use a header and 4pin socket to a female when I don&#039;t intend to have a permanent serial console for something I&#039;m working on with the same setup. </p><p>You do know the tp-links we are working (the ones made in the last 3 years) have an unbricking capability in the boot-loader? Notice the youtube video link, so the serial cable is redundant. The router looks for the reset pin being down on cold-boot and tries to load a tp-link factory.bin from a 192.168.1.66 i think.</p><p>Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k1sxwX5pMk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k1sxwX5pMk</a><br />Crosspost: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=331472#p331472">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 72#p331472</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I see the date on here, but anyone had any luck with TFTP on the new firmware version? I updated it hoping to get some use out of it, but that fully killed the routing capability. Now I can&#039;t update or revert the firmware to anything else due to the BS FEC regs. </p><p>JTAG is in the mail, any walk through or video how to actually solder it up, I&#039;ve never done that before.</p>									</div>
