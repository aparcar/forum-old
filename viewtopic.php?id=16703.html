					<p>Hello, <br />I can login to ruter with ssh root@192.168.1.1, and from there i can ping some website.</p><p>I have configured the pppoe with this commands:<br />uci set network.wan.proto=pppoe<br />uci set network.wan.username=&lt;pppoe_psername&gt;<br />uci set network.wan.password=&lt;pppoe_password&gt;<br />uci commit network<br />ifup wan</p><p>I have configured the wireless connection using:<br />config wifi-device&nbsp; &nbsp; wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;broadcom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option channel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wl0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OpenWrt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption&nbsp; &nbsp;none</p><p>I have changed the ttl using:<br />iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j TTL --ttl-set 64<br />iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -j TTL --ttl-set 64</p><p>Is there a probem with my wireless config ?

					<p>From what you said, <br />&quot;I repeat myself: even if the router has internet connection (ping ... works), i can not do the same on my notebook. And my notebook is connected to the router, because i can connect with ssh to it.&quot;</p><p>I think your bridging has some problems....the router does not know how to <br />forward packets from wan to your lan..and vise versa<br />..can you post your network config too...</p>									</div>

					<p>I have resolved the problem.<br />I was using: <br />iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i ppp0 -j TTL --ttl-set 64;<br />iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j TTL --ttl-set 64;<br />but at the second comand i used -i instead of -o, so no packages for my wireless</p><p>But now everything works fine. Thanks.</p>									</div>
