					<p>Hi everyone, <br />New to this stuff, but so far I&#039;ve managed to get a fully working OpenWrt x386 implementation running <br />on an old Digital Engine DE2700 box, using a 1gb Compact Flash card.<br />I&#039;ve even installed OpenVPN &amp; configured everything as i want it, but unless I have a monitor connected it wont boot.<br />Once booted i can disconnect the monitor, but this isn&#039;t practical if I need to reboot the router or if there&#039;s a power outage.</p><p>I have no doubt there is a config file that I need to tweak somewhere, but despite a lot of searching i&#039;m stuck.<br />I don&#039;t know which file to edit, how to edit it &amp; what needs to be added/removed.</p><p>I could of course buy a dummy DVI adapter but that seems crazy when I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a straighforward solution to this.<br />If anyone knows how to go about solving this it would be really appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance<br />juni0r123</p>									</div>
