					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am new to openwrt and linux. having installed an transparent tinyproxy, my home router now produces a log.</p><p>CONNECT&nbsp; &nbsp;Jan 30 21:31:06 [28446]: Connect (file descriptor 6): ::ffff:192.168.1.144 [::ffff:192.168.1.144]</p><p>To provide better readability/usability of the produced log I would rather have (host)names instead of ip adresses in the log. Furthermore using Dhcp the ip adresses might change and one cannot easily identitfy the corresponding user to the ip in the log. Is there a technique(other than static leases to Ip and hostname) which allows to receive the “computernames”, which devices have somehow anyway, in the log? i.e. my Android tablet has a name “PeterTablet” or my Win8 PC has a computername “cruncher” – those names should appear in the log.</p><p>I appreciate any hint as to achieve that!</p><p>BTW:<br />tinyproxy logging calls getnameinfo to the OS, I believe</p>									</div>

					<p>News!</p><p>the developer of tinyproxy stated that the current state of tinyproxy implementation does not log hostnames at all.</p><p>See : <a href="https://github.com/tinyproxy/tinyproxy/issues/14">https://github.com/tinyproxy/tinyproxy/issues/14</a></p><p>As tinyproxy is already causing quite a load with multipe connections, I rather refrain from enabling even more expensive hostname logging on my router.</p><p>So I will see if I get polipo as transparent proxy on Rasberry Pi b+ running in RAM ....</p>									</div>
