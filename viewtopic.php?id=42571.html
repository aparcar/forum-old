					<p>Hi, is there a way in AA to find out, which leds are lighting (meaning which ethernet cables are plugged in)? I have found some references in oldwiki scripts to /proc/diag/led/, but I don&#039;t see such directories and ls /proc -R | grep &quot;led&quot; found nothing useful. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Doesn&#039;t dmesg tell you what is plugged in? So rather than finding out what LED is lit, just search through dmesg: I don&#039;t have a suitable router to test, sorry.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, I&#039;ve tried on a few routers and dmesg has really the info I need. There are links like<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[   15.290000] br-lan: port 1(eth1) entered forwarding state
[   15.300000] br-lan: port 1(eth1) entered forwarding state
[   16.560000] br-lan: port 2(eth0) entered forwarding state</code></pre></div><p>Which correspond with wan and lan connected on wr841nd. Great.</p>									</div>
