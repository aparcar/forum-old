					<p>Crossposting this from the HOWTO forum since questions aren&#039;t supposed to be posted there.</p><p>So, this device is in the table of supported hardware but there is no information on exactly how to install OpenWRT.&nbsp; The build flow only produces &quot;openwrt-ramips-rt305x-wcr150gn-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin&quot; but no &quot;factory&quot; image is created.&nbsp; How do I get OpenWRT onto the device in the first place?&nbsp; I tried using the generated OpenWRT bin file with the SparkLAN firmware upgrade web interface but it detects it as invalid firmware and aborts the process.<br />Does the stock SparkLAN firmware have a bootloader that I can interact with (tftp maybe)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Updating this in case someone else runs into this problem ...</p><p>To load OpenWRT you need to connect to the board using the serial port. (4-pin header on the card).&nbsp; The serial port runs at 57600, 8 bit data, 1 stop bit, no parity.&nbsp; During the boot process a menu is displayed in the serial output and you can select to load a firmware image using tftp.</p><p>The SparkLAN device is a tftp client so you&#039;ll need to configure a tftp server on your Windows/Linux host.&nbsp; I was using Windows so I downloaded Solarwind&#039;s free tftp server.&nbsp; I placed the sysupgrade OpenWRT image in the root directory for the tftp server.&nbsp; After that it was simply a matter of configuring the host and device IP addresses when prompted by the bootloader.&nbsp; The bootloader copies the image through tftp, erases flash and then copies OpenWRT over.&nbsp; (Hooray.)</p><p>Now I just need to learn how to configure OpenWRT ... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
