					<p>I&#039;m trying to disable the failsafe mode on a GL-AR150. While I don&#039;t see an option to set it in menuconfig, There is a CONFIG_TARGET_PREINIT_DISABLE_FAILSAFE setting available in the .config file. Setting it causes make to complain that the configuration is out of sync, but it still compiles. After flashing the router, however, failsafe is not disabled - booting the router with the reset button held for 5 seconds still causes it to boot into failsafe mode. </p><p>Does anyone know the correct way to do this?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
