					<p>I have a bricked wgt624 which I have connected via serial console. I&#039;ve managed to boot kamikaze (using squashfs) and the shell works fine, though I can&#039;t seem to get the network-interface(s) up properly. My real question though is whether anyone here has been able to boot the original firmware over tftp? It seems to be compressed/encrypted in some way, but I haven&#039;t been able to find any information on how. I&#039;ve been able to boot the firmware for the TEW-510APB from Trendnet just by removing some sort of header, so that I&#039;m left with an executable image (not 100% compatible though, it locks up in certain places), but Netgear hasn&#039;t made it that easy.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ar531x rev 0x00005850 firmware startup...

					<p>That looks like the original type of Hardware ID from the Docs on the Openwrt page for the netgear wgt624.&nbsp; Did you happen to notice that ?&nbsp; If so, did you try changing the board id ?&nbsp; Under section 1.4 (firmware) on the page.</p><p>Any effect ?</p>									</div>
