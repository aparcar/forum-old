But now when I try to run internet in this, it doesn&#039;t respond. I tried ping [ip address&nbsp; of Google] but this also did not work. </p><p>How to enable wifi connection in this?</p><p>Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aayu5h</strong> on 1 Mar 2016, 21:07)</p>

					<p>Run ifconfig to see if interface is up.<br />I tried default x86-64 compilation on vmware and it didnt work because required ethernet driver was missing. Had to install additional kmod : kmod-pcnet32. Had to copy required ipks to openwrt filesystem because network was unavailable. Boot from linux livecd in the VM and mount virtual hard disk filesystem, transfer files.<br />Next - you need correct configuration of /etc/config/network. By default vmware offers NATed network with dhcp and openwrt defaults to static 192.168.1.1/24 which will not work.<br />And what wifi connection are you talking about ? How are you going to have wifi adapter within VM ? Its easy in case of USB wifi stick, but if its not usb then its not possible to bring wifi adapter to VM.<br />Even if you assign USB stick to VM then you need correct kmod for it. Not all chipsets are supported, you can find linux does not support your adapter. I&#039;d first boot to a linux livecd with new kernel and look if a kmod assigned to the stick. Command is called &quot;usb-devices&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 2 Mar 2016, 09:37)</p>
