					<p>I made a post about this in the SiliconDust forums but maybe someone here could help me solve this</p><p>I used to have a HDHomeRun Prime connected to my network which received ClearQAM channels. I never had a problem with this device. Comcast then decided to encrypt absolutely every station so I no longer get ClearQAM.</p><p>Now I use a HDHomeRun dual since it can use an antenna. I have been able to get it to work a couple of times but it eventually loses network connectivity. The light on the front will just blink green.</p><p>The device is currently in my DHCP list but when I type the assigned IP address it doesn&#039;t connect to it. The only way I&#039;ve been able to get it working again is by unplugging the Dual, turning off the router, wait a minute or so, turn the router on again, wait for the router to stabilize, and plug back in the Dual. Even that is not 100%. Sometimes I have to unplug the Dual and plug it back in for it to eventually work.</p><p>Any idea what setting I might need to fix or change in order to keep this device on the network?</p>									</div>

					<p>how long before it dies? Is this by chance the time at which the DHCP lease expires? You could try extending this time. </p><p>What happens if you reboot the device instead of the router? </p><p>Alternatively, set the HDHomeRun to a static IP on the device itself, not the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think the license says 12 hours each time but it lasts longer than that before it poofs. It currently says under 10 hours remaining so I&#039;ll see if it still works later tonight. Is there a way to set the lease to be indefinite?</p><p>How do I set a static IP for a device with no interface? Is that under Static Leases? If so, how do I do that? (I&#039;m nervous to just do it myself because I think this is what caused me to lose access to my router all together before).</p><p>Every time I reset the router and the device, the Dual ends up with the same IP address if that info is important.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RUsum1</strong> on 29 Nov 2014, 18:00)</p>

					<p>I did not correctly read this.&nbsp; You can not set a static IP on the device.&nbsp; All you can do is force the static IP from the router based upon MAC.</p><p>I also have recently learned, having issues with my unit, that some of the flaky behavior on these units might be the power supply failing.</p>									</div>
