					<p>I am new to OpenWrt and I have a Buffalo router which is now loaded with the 7.06 release of Kamikaze.&nbsp; I have the router configured and working as a wireless repeater to bridge to my DLink router connected to my ISP.</p><p>I can connect and pass traffic but I am having problems implementing some security.</p><p>Ideally, I would like to configure the access with a shared authentication WEP key and MAC address filtering.&nbsp; I know it is not high level security, but should provide all that I need.</p><p>I have tried to research this through the documentation but cannot find the answers.&nbsp; However, I did try to use the following config parameters in /etc/config/wireless.</p><p># for Shared Authentication <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option encryption wep <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;61616161616161616161616161<br /># for Shared Authentication <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option auth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1</p><p># for mac filtering</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option macfilter&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 (also tried 2, allow, allowed and macmode)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option maclist&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;00:00:00:00:00:00 11:11:11:11:11:11&quot;</p><br /><p>I have also tried editing /lib/wifi/broadcom.sh&nbsp; with the same mac lines, replacing the<br />macfilter 0<br />maclist none</p><p>lines.</p><p>I only have the base package of Kamikaze installed.</p><p>Do I need to install other packages to enable shared authentication for WEP, or is it even supported (yet) ?</p><p>What do I need to do to install MAC filtering to allow only the MAC&#039;s that I list.</p><p>Also, is it possible to set the AP to use a short preamble?&nbsp; The reason for this third question is that I also connect to my wireless network from Pocket PC type PDA&#039;s and although the PDA sees the AP, it can&#039;t connect.&nbsp; In sniffing the wireless networks that I can connect to, they all use a short preamble.&nbsp; The Kamikaze AP however shows that it has a long preamble.</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>									</div>
