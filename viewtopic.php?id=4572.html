					<p>I&#039;ve got a small network at home based around a WRT54GS. One PC has a wired connection, another 2 plus a couple of laptops use wireless. What I&#039;d like to do is place a limit on the amout of data being downloaded from the Internet to one of the PCs using the WAP, without affecting anything else (eg internal Samba transfers). Is this possible? I&#039;ve had basic inbound traffic shaping on the WAN interface for some time now - can something similar be used on the br0 interface, for example?</p>									</div>
