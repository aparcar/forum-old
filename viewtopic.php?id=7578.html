					<p>I am in the process of gathering all the parts required to build a serial cable for my Netgear WGT634U.&nbsp; I have read the docs and am going down the nokia data cable route.&nbsp; The question I have is does the cable have to be a nokia&gt;&gt;USB type or can you use the Nokia&gt;&gt;Serial type.</p><p>How would I access the router if I were to use the USB cable?&nbsp; What would the settings be in telnet?</p><p>Sorry if this is an FAQ&nbsp; but Ihave read the docs and seem to be going around in circles looking for the answer, I hope you can help.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; I already have an old DLR-3P, would this be suitable?&nbsp; The unit is sealed so I can&#039;t see if there is a max* chip in there or not.&nbsp; Sorry for asking these questions, I know they are documented but I just want to make sure so that I don&#039;t damage my router.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be OK with the linux side of things once I get it up and running.</p>									</div>

					<p>I haven&#039;t personally used that model cable, but since the second link I gave you <span class="bbu">specifically</span> says, &quot;You can also use Nokia DLR-3P data cable&quot;, I&#039;d bet it works.&nbsp; </p><p>Just keep in mind that second post is for the NSLU2, so those pinouts aren&#039;t the same for your WRT.&nbsp; Match up the signaling on the cable from that page with the signaling for your WRT to get it right.&nbsp; Quoted from the second link I gave you,&nbsp; &quot;Just cut off connector and wire RED to J2 pin 1 (+3.3V), GREEN to J2 pin 2 (RXD), GRAY to J2 pin 3 (TXD) and BLACK+SHIELD to J2 pin 4 (GND).&quot;</p><p>So:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Cable-color | Function | WRT Pins
    RED     |   +3.3V  |      ??
   GREEN    |     RX   |      ??
    GRAY    |     TX   |      ??
  BLK-SHLD  |    GND   |      ??</code></pre></div><p>You can find your WRT pins for these functions in the wiki.&nbsp; All the information you need is out there, just read it 5 times. :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks bluesguy, you are being a massive help.&nbsp; Just one final question, do i marry up the rx and tx pins i.e green wire(RX) goes to pin RX on my router or does the RX wire go to the TX pin on my router?</p>									</div>

					<p>rx &lt;-&gt; tx</p><p>It doesn&#039;t hurt anything if you get it wrong, so try it, and if it doesn&#039;t work, swap them.&nbsp; Just make sure you get power and ground right.</p>									</div>
