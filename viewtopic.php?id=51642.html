To address this, we decided to do a fresh start<br />on GitHub. The new feed <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages">https://github.com/openwrt/packages</a> should be<br />used from now on and package maintainers are asked to move their<br />packages there. For the final release we will still build the old<br />packages feed but it will be necessary to enable it manually in the<br />opkg package list to be usable. All current feeds should not have any<br />dependencies on the old.packages feed. Currently a few packages still<br />fail, mainly due to these cross feed dependencies. We will contact the<br />respective maintainers to help resolve these issues for RC2.</p><br /><p>New build servers<br />We would like to express our gratitude to Imagination Technology for<br />funding the 2 build servers that we used for the release.</p><br /><p>Whats next ?<br />We aim at releasing Chaos Calmer (CC) before the end of the year. The<br />CC release will use 3.14 or a newer LTS kernel as baseline.</p><br /><p>Have fun!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The OpenWrt developer team</p></blockquote></div><p>Get it here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07-rc1/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07-rc1/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I am not sure that this new to this release, but I use He.net for ipv6 6in4 and LuCi interface were both missing.<br />After installing and configuring, neither restarting the network nor rebooting would automatically start the wan6 interface I had to start it manually in both cases.</p>									</div>
