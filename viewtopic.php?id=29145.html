					<p>After reading everything I could find, and thanks to hnyman and others I finally have a pretty good IPv6 Tunnel with HE.&nbsp; Radvd still has some serious issues since I have to manually restart after any net change.&nbsp; That however, is not my problem just my way of introducing mysefl as another NOOB to OpenWRT.</p><p>Here is my problem, my broaband connect is via a 2wire RG (residential gateway) that is required to act effectively as a dsl modem.&nbsp; I&#039;ve placed the WNDR3700v2 in the DMZ so that it can get all of the tunnel traffic, and that works well. But, I get this message logged in the RG almost everytime a DNS request is made:</p><p>fw,fwmon src=xx.yyy.aaa.bbb dst=8.8.4.4 ipprot=1 <br />icmp_type=3 icmp_code=3 ICMP Dest Unreachable, session terminated </p><p>xx.yyy.aaa.bbb is my obsfuscated ip addr and can be ignored; 8.8.4.4 is the google dns servers that I have the WNDR3700v2 using, but it occurs for the other one as well - 8.8.8.8.&nbsp; If I specify my ISP dns servers, in the WAN settings then those are logged instead.&nbsp; It seems as though dnsmasq may be trying to reuse UDP sessions&nbsp; and the port is rejected?</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p><p>BTW, if I just let the clients do their own dns requests I don&#039;t see any errors.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Amigadude</strong> on 18 Mar 2011, 05:35)</p>
