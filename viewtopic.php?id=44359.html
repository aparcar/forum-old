					<p>Hello,</p><p>I just noticed that my Openwrt build is MUCH larger now than a few days ago and I didnt change anything.</p><p>Did someone change some code at theOpenwrt distribution that caused my make to re-download some packages and re-make it causing the size change?</p><p>Also &quot;utime&quot; is no longer defined in uclibc because when I run my app on the target, it crashes because utime is not in uclibc all of a sudden, when it was all working just a few days ago.</p><p>I noticed on the Openwrt website that it said they switched to a different uclibc, also switched kernels, and many other stuff, is this causing my build to be much bigger now my code can no longer run.</p><p>Why do they keep adding more and more code?</p><p>Just a few days ago I had 12meg free on the target, now suddennly its only 9 meg free, and I didnt write 3 megs of code in the past few days, so something changed in Openwrt, becuase when you type make, it goes and updates the packages while doing builds, this is something I dont like about the openwrt build system, it goes and changes things behind your back, gumming up whatever you were doing.</p><p>3 Megs of RAM is a big deal.</p><p>Anybody noticed any changes to their builds within the past few days.</p><p>rough</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK it is the new kernel that is causing the bloating. If possible I would stay with AA final (and download the full source in case you need to build any or everything in future).</p>									</div>

					<p>robthebrew,</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion about using AA, however according to the website&nbsp; <a href="https://openwrt.org/">https://openwrt.org/</a>&nbsp; AA the one with the new kernel thats causing the bloat? Do you know how to build AA without the new kernel? </p><p>The other issue is..... according to the uclibc website <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/">http://www.uclibc.org/</a> they just released a new version of ucLibc on May 15, if you look on this other website&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://manulix.wikidot.com/build-howto">http://manulix.wikidot.com/build-howto</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; someone had the same problem with utime being missing, and the date at the bottom of that page is May 14,2013, one day before they released the new version.</p><p>Do you know how I can build AA with the old version of uClibc?</p><p>Man!!! this is such a big problem, not only do I have to fix my own bugs, but other people in the world are making changes messing me up too.</p><p>Thanks<br />rough</p>									</div>
