					<p>WRT1900AC have good progress, see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac.</a></p><p>Maybe you can take a look on TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750 V2. ath10k has worked for 802.11AC on that router for a while and both performance and stability are OK. Note the HW version because V1 is not supported by ath10k so 5G will be a lost. V2 is good.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your replies.<br />AC is a &quot;nice to have&quot; currently because i do not have any AC clients so far (only g/n). Would be ok if it works next year. </p><p>Stability, range and performance (in VPN client mode) is more important.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re looking at R7000, you should rather take a look at R8000. It&#039;s a bit more expensive, but at least there is open source wireless driver for it (and so R8000 is quite nicely supported by 15.05).</p>									</div>

E.g. a fix for setting TX power was sent only a day or two ago, so it&#039;s still not working in 15.05.
