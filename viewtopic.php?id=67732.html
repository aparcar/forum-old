					<p>Hello!</p><p>I use VLANs on my TPlink WR1043 to separate several machines on my network. From the router&#039;s point of view the modem of my cable TV provider represents the WAN side. I need to split my net there, because that modem is controlled by the provider and thus it is not trustworthy to me..</p><p>However, my TV is also placed inside this WAN side, because it needs the TV signal from that modem. Basically, the network looks like this:</p><p>WAN (modem, TV) &lt;-&gt; OpenWRT &lt;-&gt; VLANs (my pc, servers, printers, and others)</p><p>Now I want to run a DLNA server inside VLAN3 and I need to route its traffic from there to the WAN zone. Following <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/udp_multicast"> these instructions</a>, I set up igmpproxy and I simply replaced WAN with VLAN3 and LAN with WAN in that instructions:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config igmpproxy
        option quickleave 1

config phyint
        option network dlna
        option direction upstream
        list altnet 0.0.0.0/0

config phyint
        option network wan
        option direction downstream</code></pre></div><p>The server is running in zone &quot;dlna&quot;. </p><p>Of course I applied the firewall entries shown on that page, and of course I switched the zone names there as well. But that does not work, my TV does not find the DNLA server. </p><p>Before I do more experiments without any success, I&#039;d like to ask if it is possible at all to use a DLNA-Server *inside* LAN and feed a client in WAN with it. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>									</div>
