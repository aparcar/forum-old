					<p>What you need is to bridge the WAN interface to a switch port. That will make your set top box receive an address from your ISP instead of your router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t bridge, this would make the CPU do more work. Instead use the switch functionality and separate two ports from the other two ports. In some cases this could be described as port 1 and 2 and CPU (WAN side?) would be in one VLAN group and port 2 and 3 and CPU LAN side would be in another group. No tagging. Just separation.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had thought about that somewhat. However, the setup box is connected to a switch and that switch in turn is connected to the router. So, apart from the setup box, there are several other devices connected to the switch. And all of them need to acquire DHCP from the router instead of the ISP.</p><p>I believe the bridging the WAN interface with a switch port would only work if the setup box were connected directly to a switch port on the router. </p><p>I have also thought about tagged VLAN&#039;s. Again, unfortunately, no dice. The Draytek engineers have only implemented port based VLAN&#039;s. My forementioned switch however is fully managed and supports tagged VLAN&#039;s. </p><p>I&#039;m at my wits end with the dual MAC/IP idea:)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Jeroen1000</strong> on 14 Feb 2011, 00:12)</p>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>NetworkPro wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>- You need to get the TV on the ISP network</p></blockquote></div><p>correct.

Unlike the setup box they&#039;ll reside behind the Openwrt NAT.&nbsp; <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>NetworkPro wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>- Your cabling is 30 meters to the OpenWRT router and there is no problem of running a short cable from the router to the TV and the PCs</p></blockquote></div><p>No quite. I didn&#039;t know all the details mattered. So the Cisco switch is in the room where I watch TV. The setup box and stuff like an XBOX and WD-LIVE are connected to it. From there it is 30M to Draytek router. From the Draytek there is another cable run to a switch in my study room.

You&#039;re using port 2 on the Draytek router for the TV (I&#039;m assuming TV = setup box here) but in fact the Cisco switch is to be connected to port 2. And of all devices connected to the Cisco switch, only the TV/setup box should get an IP from my ISP. </p><p>Thanks for trying to figure this on out with me so far.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Jeroen1000</strong> on 14 Feb 2011, 14:37)</p>
