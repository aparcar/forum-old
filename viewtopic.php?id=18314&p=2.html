					<p>I suggest we use the thread on the WNR2000.&nbsp; Bottom line is that the WNR2000 u-boot does some kind of checksum calc that is an issue with flashing.&nbsp; The Trendnet is a pretty good starting point on this platform as they are inexpensive (on sale for $25 here in the USA several times) and they have a nice recovery flash if we screw them up <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>I&#039;m really just doing testing and trying to keep things moving forward.&nbsp; I wish we could get more people involved on this router platform - it has a lot of potential and they are a lot cheaper than the beloved Linksys WRT54GL.&nbsp; It is Gabor Juhos (key OpenWRT developer) who is doing the real work here.&nbsp; I just donated a Planex router to him that is in the mail from USA --&gt; Hungry that I think will probably help us with some of the non-Trendnet (DLink) flashing.&nbsp; For now, the WNR2000 is tftpboot only... you can automate it, but you need a second system around to be tftpd server when units are booted.&nbsp; And settings won&#039;t be saved (ramdisk).&nbsp; Although don&#039;t be chicken to experiment, I did.&nbsp; the tftp recovery the WNR2000 is little tricky, but you can recover from a bad flash.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoundSparrow</strong> on 23 Jan 2009, 06:05)</p>

					<p>Jeremy Collake helped me figure out how to get to u-boot prompt on these routers!&nbsp; The trick is:</p><p>1) Hold down reset while connecting power to go to recovery boot.<br />2) Issue Control-C from the serial port console.&nbsp; I just hold down control-c and it works for me, not sure on the exact timing.</p><p>So now you can do things like tftpboot.&nbsp; HOWEVER, WARNING:&nbsp; DO NOT update the u-boot environment.&nbsp; DO NOT d something like this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ar7100&gt; setenv bootdelay 3

					<p>My intention for now is to see if I can just extend the capability of this router by adding more apps to it.</p><p>I&#039;ve downloaded the GPL code that trendnet made available on their web site.&nbsp; I&#039;m able to modify the stock busybox to add more features, add dropbear, and my own app onto it.<br />I use the firmware mod kit to build a new firmware with my extended rootfs, and the router just takes it with no problem.</p><p>The trendnet rootfs starts /etc/rc.d/rcS after init.&nbsp; It then executes /sbin/rc which starts the rest of the application.&nbsp; Unfortunately, /sbin/rc is a closed source program, as is httpd so you&#039;re kind of limited on the app starting order.&nbsp; The httpd is also closed-source.&nbsp; It seems to have built-in .cgi which won&#039;t recognize any other cgi, but it does display any static file you add to /www.&nbsp; If you want to add your own cgi, you&#039;ll have to add another httpd of your own, run on a different port and add the link to the .asp pages on /www.</p><p>Like I mention, I&#039;m able to add my own app and run it just fine.&nbsp; However, my app has a unique persistent storage requirement - it needs to save a text file.&nbsp; This router has nvram, but I don&#039;t want to use it because my app needs a complex data structure, not flat like what nvram does.&nbsp; The stock nvram does allow you to set/get/show options.&nbsp; On the command line, it shows that it has a save and restore (file) option, but I don&#039;t think those options work.&nbsp; I dig around the rooffs tree and find a nvram.h file which exposes the functions of the libnvram.so library.&nbsp; Some of the notable functions defined in nvram.h are: nvram_set(), nvram_get(), nvram_unset(), and the 2 functions that seem to be missing from the nvram executable: int nvram_file_save() and int nvram_file_restore().&nbsp; Just like in the command line says, these 2 functions take in a name and a file name (char*) as input parameters.&nbsp; So I write a small program that call these 2 functions.&nbsp; I compile and link it to the libnvram.so, and it happily creates my executable.&nbsp; </p><p>It&#039;s probably worth to mention that the libnvram.so does not read/write to /dev/nvram as the openwrt nvram does.&nbsp; It actually read/write into /dev/mtdblock1, which is the &quot;Config&quot; patition of the 4MB NOR flash.&nbsp; I have no clear idea what these functions do.&nbsp; My guess, and I hope that the nvram_file_save() function takes a file and saves it to the persistent storage and the nvram_file_restore() fetches it from the flash (by the key name) and writes it out to a restore file.&nbsp; When I run my own nvram which calls the save() function:</p><p>#mynvram save foo foo.txt</p><p>it seems to pause a little bit as if it&#039;s writing to the flash (i have no way to confirm it).&nbsp; And when I run:</p><p>#mynvram restore foo /tmp/out.txt</p><p>it does produce a /tmp/out.txt, but empty.</p><p>Like I said, I have no clear idea of what these functions do, so I just gave it a shot to see where it goes, but they don&#039;t quite work the way I hope it would.</p><p>Has anyone gone further that I have and perhaps shed some light?&nbsp; Do you know of any way to save a file to one of the mtd partition?</p>									</div>

There is no web interface in the default load I provided.&nbsp; You can load one with the OpenWRT package manager.</p><p>2. The recovery page should work.&nbsp; Are you holding reset BEFORE you plug in the router... then 30 seconds after you plug in the router?&nbsp; It should NOT boot into normal, then the status light should blink.&nbsp; The reset button is a little hard to hold, I suggest finding something that fits well.&nbsp; I used a q-tip that I cut in half, the stem of the q-tip is perfectly sized <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />&nbsp; You will need this if you want to go back to Trendnet or D-Link vendor firmware.</p><p>3. To update the router from openwrt to openwrt... use the .bin file.&nbsp; You can do these:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A) make sure the router can reach the internet.&nbsp; You may need to use UCI to set an IP Address to your main internet router.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;B) cd /tmp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;C) wget <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/stephengutknecht/Home/openwrt_14334_k28p2-ar71xx-tew-632brp-squashfs.bin?attredirects=0">http://sites.google.com/site/stephengut … edirects=0</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;D) mtd -r write openwrt_14334_k28p2-ar71xx-tew-632brp-squashfs.bin firmware</p><p>Router should reboot on own and go into the new OpenWRT, I think config gets reset back to default.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RoundSparrow</strong> on 3 Feb 2009, 00:54)</p>
