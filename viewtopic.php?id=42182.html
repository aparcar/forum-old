					<p>Thank you for reply. I don&#039;t know how much safety will these extra gigabytes add, but I&#039;d like to use most of my space effectively. I think that ntfs is robust fs, yet it seems effective to me, because I can use almost all of the physical space, but on linux I&#039;d rather keep linux fs, especially on embedded device. So what are the correct mkfs parameters to use as much space as possible, without such a big overhead? Or should I just live with knowing, that I could have stored 13GB more, if I&#039;d have used microsoft fs?</p>									</div>

					<p>I really can not tell you what is the best solution for you. You are going to use it from a linux machine, then imho any linux native filesystem is better than a &#039;foreign&#039; one. (Anyway, as I am always favouring un*x over windows, my answers can not be taken as neutral, please take that fact into account.)<br />ext4 is safer than ext2, filesystem checks are faster,... and you pay the price: ~1.5% of drive capacity.

					<p>Nothing, other than it is quite old, but if no better alternative arrives, I will give ext2 a try.

					<p>Thank you guys for very helpful posts. Maybe I will stay with journaling enabled and sacrifice those gigs &quot;wasted&quot; for the sake of data integrity. I think can tweak it later when I will be short of space <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Now I don&#039;t wonder, why ntfs uses less space, when it has journaling disabled by default, or allocates dynamically is as it goes. Uneducated spectator might think, that ntfs is far more effective, but it only looks better in the beginning. Now I know a bit more. Thanks again.</p>									</div>

There&#039;s no file /etc/mke2fs.conf&nbsp; and tune2fs seems to be missing in openwrt too, even if the package claims it should be there <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/yikes.png" width="15" height="15" alt="yikes" /> (wth?)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@wr1043nd:~# opkg info e2fsprogs
