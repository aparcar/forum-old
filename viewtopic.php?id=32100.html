					<p>I just wanted to drop a quick thread to all the developers who work (or worked) on OpenWRT. I&#039;ve been tinkering with it for the last few months and finally decided to replace my Cisco 871 router with an Alix 2d13 running OpenWRT Backfire. Thanks to all the developers who worked on putting OpenWRT together! It truly is an impressive piece of software!</p><p>I&#039;m especially impressed with the Firewall. iptables are a pain. /etc/config/firewall makes something which is normally a complex nightmare into something that is completely manageable. Nice work.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>
