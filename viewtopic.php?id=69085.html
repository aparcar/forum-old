					<p>I use a tp-link ac1750 as a wireless AP which is in turn connected to a pfsense firewall. </p><p>For countless years, I&#039;ve been using high end firewalls such as cisco, juniper and firebox but for my local network, no longer need such hardware. I&#039;ve started using pfsense as my primary firewall but use openwrt in my daily projects.</p><p>My home connection is only 100Mbps and I use pfsense running on an Dual Core AMD 8GB. Overkill but it&#039;s what I had at the time. </p><p>Pfsense recommends a quad CPU with 4GB of memory for 50Mbps+, especially if I want to use vpn and other feeatures which I do not use from home. Yet, the AC1750 only has a 720Mhz CPU.</p><p>Basically, I have VoIP, some web services and a mail server on my LAN at this point, the rest is all for development work so my needs are really pretty basic these days.The point being that I have LAN side of machines and not only wireless. Wireless is rather secondary for us.</p><p>My question is, could the AC1750, converted to openwrt cover my needs? The AC17850 has gigabit ports and a total of 1.75Gbps combined bandwidth. I&#039;d never really thought of using openwrt as my firewall. I&#039;ve read that 5Ghz wireless is not supported unless you upgrade the wireless module.</p><p>Wondering if anyone might have some input on this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>projects</strong> on 31 Dec 2016, 20:31)</p>
