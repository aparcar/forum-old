					<p>A few areas that I think could be improved are:</p><p>* more comprehensive homepage for the documentation (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/">http://wiki.openwrt.org/</a>)<br />* references for important APIs, such as for procd (I&#039;ve done an initial draft of this), lib/functions.sh and others <br />* tutorials for building OpenWrt in various configuration and testing, particularly using QEMU and other VMs.<br />* documentation should be &quot;versioned&quot; so it&#039;s clear whether it is up to date or needs to be tested against a new version<br />* Guide on the OpenWrt source tree. It should include a description of what&#039;s in the tree, how and why one would modify the tree and how the source tree corresponds to the compiled device output tree<br />* Guide on OpenWrt security. OpenWrt by default uses root for most services but there are ways to improve security for services while still fitting into the OpenWrt ecosystem. The guide should explain features like StackProtector, running a service as a less privileged user, OpenWrt jails, LXC. There should be a discussion of the pros and cons of each so developers have figure out what is best for their purposes.</p>									</div>

					<p>Clean up of the various router pages. They are kind of chaotic.<br />The Table of Hardware improvement project is going very well but I&#039;m sure could use some additional help.<br />More tutorials - at least for the most common things people do with routers that are not installed by default (or maybe even things that are). <br />Links to &quot;community builds&quot;</p><p>Would love to see the prpl Foundation commit some resources to improving the OpenWrt experience for new users beyond just documentation. The GUI could use some simplification and probably an initial setup wizard. Alternatively a simple and advanced interface would help. The design of the package manager could be simplified to something similar to FreeNAS plugin setup - just on/off buttons for the most common things.

It&#039;s pure serendipity that a number of people have had the same idea at roughly the same time. As we speak, others are cleaning up the ToH/Supported Devices page to make it easier to approach OpenWrt. They&#039;re over at: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56521">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56521</a> </p><p>But although a new ToH and improved documentation will be immensely useful, they are far from the only thing that needs work.</p><p>We need to change our perception of OpenWrt. At one time, OpenWrt was a techie&#039;s plaything, that only a techie could love. If you worked hard enough, you could get it going. Probably.</p><p>But now I believe that OpenWrt has graduated. It&#039;s made it. The Barrier Breaker release has turned the corner, and we should crow about it, trumpet it from the highest tower, and let the world know that OpenWrt is easy, powerful, reliable, and safe to use.</p><p>Yet as I read the home page and the wiki, the top-level pages all contain warnings, provisos, and caveats about things that are under construction, or that might not work. This would scare away any sensible person. Look specifically at:<br />&nbsp; - <a href="http://openwrt.org">http://openwrt.org</a><br />&nbsp; - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/start</a><br />&nbsp; - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</a><br />&nbsp; - and a number of other pages linked from them</p><p>We need to change those top-level pages (and then the rest of the site&#039;s pages) to tell the story of OpenWrt. They must welcome new people. They must let people know that OpenWrt is easy to use, and inspire confidence that most anyone can succeed.</p><p>I come to this project after three years of working on CeroWrt and maintaining its web site. We used OpenWrt as a platform for solving Bufferbloat. OpenWrt was an enormous help, providing a stable platform for our research. And the best news is that we&#039;ve pushed all the good stuff back into OpenWrt. Now I&#039;m switching to OpenWrt because I need a stable production router that isn&#039;t bufferbloated.</p><p>So I&#039;m in. I&#039;m willing to help. How can we move forward?</p>									</div>

					<p>Excellent eschultz!</p><p>I will be straight forward: is it your intention to improve the documentation on the current wiki, or are/would you considering launching a new documentation platform?</p><p>I would be fine either way.</p><p>As I see it, the most important thing is to improve (clean up, add, review, reorganize, update, find ownership) the information (regarding of technical platform). A lot can be done with the wiki!</p><p>At the same time, sometimes a clean sheet is good (to not drown in old details). I think we need to consider 1st-page and wiki-navigation from a clean-sheet perspective, even if we end up just transforming the current wiki to a new structure.</p><p>There are weaknesses of the current platform(s):<br /> - table of hardware (filter, search, sort, limit columns)<br /> - tagging is not updated/consistent, and does not really &quot;work&quot;<br /> - developer site, wiki and this forum live separate lives (with manual links between them)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(imagine if the wiki &quot;automatically&quot; had links to the correct firmware builds for each hardware, and it was possible to discuss/comment directly)<br /> - for documentation/support purposes it would be valuable to have data on acual usage/installations of OpenWRT on actual devices, and data on the problems people experience, not obvious how to do that with current platform<br />I dont really care, but in 2015<br /> - the documentation could be &quot;more social&quot;<br /> - the documentation could be more modern-looking/visually attractive</p><p>The worst thing that can happen is that a separate documentation project is initiated, that it gets stuck in technical details, that it requires much effort, and that in the end we have an old wiki and a new something, that both are equally incomplete, and nobody knows where to look or where to update. That is not going to happen or course.</p><p>I think it could be good to discuss this and come to a decision, so all efforts go in the same direction.<br />Perhaps very little discussion is needed, and it is completely clear that a new platform is out of scope, but that is also good for everyone to know.</p><p>I have (as most of you have seen) gathered information from the current wiki to present it in a new way:<br />&nbsp; <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9061436/openwrt/toh/latest/index.html">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/906 … index.html</a><br />I think this kind of &quot;tactical&quot; solutions can support improving the wiki or even complement it in the future.</p>									</div>

					<p>Glad to know other folks are interested!</p><p>I&#039;ll just summarize what I&#039;ve read so far and respond:<br /></p><ul><li><p>No clear ownership of the documentation or portions of the documentation - I second this. Ideally, we&#039;d have a documentation team. Each person could have particular responsibilities, organize a section, etc.</p></li><li><p>Table of hardware needs improvement - Clearly. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> At a minimum, @zo0ok&#039;s work seems great! That would help a ton.</p></li></ul><p>One question long term would be management of the actual pages detailing support for various routers. We might be able to get a bit of support from some of prpl&#039;s current or future members to address those for their own hardware but I don&#039;t really know.</p><ul><li><p>a place to discuss edits - yes, definitely. I wasn&#039;t sure where the best place to have this discussion even was at first. Are the forums the place? Or is somewhere else better. Talk page? Using a bug tracker like Github issues?</p></li><li><p>a place to track progress - how do we know what has been accomplished and what need to be done? Is the forum the best place or should we try something like a bug tracker? I think answering this problem is critical because it&#039;s a primary way to recruit new folks into the OpenWrt documentation community. As @tmo26 said, people are willing to help, they just don&#039;t know what to do!</p></li><li><p>homepage needs to be welcoming - I think this is partly related to organization. If we organize the documentation properly, with references, guides and tutorials for users, packagers and developers, this is very solvable problem.</p></li></ul><p>As for whether we start from scratch or use the wiki as is, I want to do whatever we think would get more folks involved and come up with the best result. prpl has a wiki (MediaWiki) and forums (Discourse) if we&#039;d like to move any of the work there. I don&#039;t want to do anything too technically complex or custom of course. One potential issue with the prpl wiki though is that the OpenWrt wiki is under a license (CC-BY-SA-NC) which isn&#039;t compatible with prpl&#039;s wiki license (CC-BY). It&#039;s a surmountable problem but there&#039;s some friction there from that.</p><p>I think the first place we should start with is decide:<br /></p><ul><li><p>what the scope of what we want to do is? - Do we start over? If so, where do we host our work? Should it be a wiki where we have a talk page?</p></li><li><p>how we organize and document our work? - Is this forum the proper place for general discussion? Should we use an Issue tracker? Do we want clearer responsibilities for particular areas?</p></li></ul><p>What does everyone think? Also, does this cover the main questions we need to decide immediately?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eschultz</strong> on 4 May 2015, 19:41)</p>

					<p>re: How do we proceed? (My thoughts on several of the topics discussed in this thread...)</p><p>I recommend a lot of hardware and software to friends and professionals. My reputation is bound up in the quality of experience that people have. I really like OpenWrt, and the power, capability, and simplicity that it offers. </p><p>My over-arching goal for OpenWrt is that I feel comfortable saying to a modestly-skilled person, &quot;Oh, you want a good router? Just go to OpenWrt.org and you will see how to install new firmware that will work *way* better than your vendor&#039;s stock build.&quot;</p><p>This implies a few things:</p><p>- The main OpenWrt.org home page should let people know they&#039;ve come to the right place. People should get the notion that &quot;OpenWrt Just Works&quot;, that they can install better firmware in their existing router, or if they want to replace it, then here are suggestions...</p><p>- There should be a clear path (needing only two or three clicks) that gets them to a) the firmware for their router, and b) the instructions for installing. And people should be successful a high percentage of the time (90%? 95%?) using the instructions.</p><p>- Visitors want to feel comfortable that they can get help if they have trouble/questions. The forum&#039;s pretty good, but it would be nice if people succeeded a higher fraction of the time, so they didn&#039;t have to ask...</p><p>Is this a good goal (&quot;OpenWrt Just Works for Newbies&quot;) for the project? </p><p>Based on my desires above, let me also say:</p><p>- Let&#039;s improve what we have. The bottom-level pages (the ones that can be edited by people who have the knowledge and care to share) are in reasonable shape. We need to update the top-level stuff to be more helpful.</p><p>- We definitely should have a template for a perfect &quot;Device Details&quot; page. </p><p>- I am pinning a lot of my hopes on the Device Details pages linked off the ToH. I want to steer people toward models that have a link to firmware and installation instructions because (presumably), they have been tested to be accurate.</p><p>- As a corollary, I have the hopes that we can encourage OpenWrt wiki members to maintain and upgrade the device details pages for routers they own. The work that @tmo26 and @zo0ok have done is spectacular, but I don&#039;t want it to become a full-employment act :-)</p><p>- Finally, I believe nearly all the other pages in the Wiki are secondary. (Mind, they&#039;re critically important to the project.) But the audience for those pages is already familiar with OpenWrt and/or its concepts. Let&#039;s not distract new people by discussions of building OpenWrt, source tree, APIs, or other details that geeks need to know about. (There can always be a &quot;For Advanced Users&quot; section on any of those top-level pages, but new people should be able to identify that they don&#039;t need those on day one.)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your efforts.&nbsp; I think this is a great idea. </p><p>One of the areas that needs to be improved is the firewall documentation, especially for the changes related to fw3.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there is even anything on the what or why of fw3 on the wiki.&nbsp; &nbsp;In particular what is needed is more information and examples about how uci and the firewall interact.</p><p>A good starting point would be some common examples.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are some examples in the /rom/etc/config/firewall, that get overwritten so I think many people miss them.&nbsp; These mostly cover opening some ports.&nbsp; These should be added to the wiki with a little bit of docs.</p><p>I would also like to see:<br />* Blocking some specific traffic both for ingress and egress&nbsp; (example: prevent: MS Windows RPC traffic from coming in or going out of the WAN port.<br />* logging when specific things occur (example: log connections to ssh port)<br />* How to use firewall.user in conjunction with fw3 zones, and/or uci interfaces.&nbsp; &nbsp;In other words how to add rules to firewall.user without having to make it specific to each router.</p><p>Also, I think there used to be more information on hardening/securing the router beyond the default configuration that is no longer linked to the current pages and may also be out of date.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Great stuff everyone!</p><p>re: issue tracker - I think using Github issues would be the easiest and most straightforward. We can document the problems and work together on solutions. It won&#039;t clutter up the main bug tracker and it&#039;s a tool that lots of people are comfortable with. We can also easily connect it with tools like OpenHatch for highlighting OpenWrt documentation tasks. Unless folks feel this is a bad idea, I&#039;ll set it up on on the prpl Foundation&#039;s Github account and put in some of the topics already posted and then post the link here.</p><p>I think it makes sense for us to use this forum for general announcements, discussion on organizing ourselves, recruiting new participants and more.</p><p>In general, I think ownership of specific device pages is a good idea. I&#039;m not sure really to start with that. Maybe it&#039;d be best to have people here take on some of the device pages so we have some solid examples of what device page &quot;ownership&quot; entails? Or should we recruit some volunteers first? I&#039;m open to ideas on that.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>@richbhanover - great goals! I do think the developers could do some things to improve the newbie experience on the actual firmware side, but improving the documentation in the ways you describe would also go a really long way.</p><p>A really clean details page is also critical IMO. There&#039;s too much junk on a lot of them right now. I would recommend one sub page per device that includes boot logs, teardowns, serial pinouts, etc. The main details page should focus on installation of openwrt, any quirks to the openwrt install/configuration for the specific device, the basic specs, and recovery mode (if one exists).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 6 May 2015, 04:08)</p>
