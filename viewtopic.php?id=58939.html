					<p>@davidc502<br />well even killers have their own rightfulness</p><p>if they lock boot they they can also lock firmware so they can build numerous bugged devices and you as a consumer will get stuck with it.. so if you dont like it.. buy another (or write to you mum).. as in pay me to live a little longer (see the light bulb theory or the inkjet cartriges)</p><p>so when will political(bullshet) / $$$ machine side will get together and develop freedom? and not slavery </p><p>being licensed === corporations or $ and ¢; do you deny your roots; wheres your human pride? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" /> your dignity</p><p>ps: <br />fw can only change what is hardware possible<br />the transmission power / channels are hardware locked === the producer of the hardware physically prints them on silicon but the article sed about firmware lock so..</p><p>ps2<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/sercom/shg1500">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/sercom/shg1500</a><br />nice crapware.. you cant put flash on it couse fw lock</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 10 Aug 2015, 18:07)</p>

However, this may soon become more difficult according to a talk at the upcoming “Wireless Battle of the Mesh” which will take place on August 3-8 in Maribor, Slovenia.</p><p><a href="http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV8/Agenda?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=2015-08-06_wbmv8_FCC.pdf">http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV8/Agen … v8_FCC.pdf</a></p><p>The new FCC rules are in effect in the United States from June 2nd 2015 [1] for WiFi devices such as Access Points. They require to have the firmware locked down so End-Users can&#039;t operate with non-compliant parameters (channels/frequencies, transmit power, DFS, ...). In response, WiFi access point vendors start to lock down firmwares to prevent custom firmwares (such as OpenWRT) to be installed, using code signing, etc. Since the same type of devices are often sold world wide, this change does not only affect routers in the US, but also Europe, and this will also effect wireless communities.<br />We would like to discuss:<br />* What are your experiences with recently certified WiFi Hardware<br />* How can we still keep OpenWRT on these devices<br />* What can we suggest to Hardware vendors so that they keep their firmware open for community projects while still compliant with the FCC?</p><p><a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/kdb/forms/FTSSearchResultPage.cfm?id=39498&amp;switch=P7">https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/kdb/forms/FT … ;switch=P7</a></p><p>---------</p><p>sounds bad</p>									</div>
