					<p>Hi,<br />I&#039;ve just bought a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600">TL-WDR3600</a> to be able to reuse some old drives I had around, thanks to its advertised &quot;Local Storage&quot; feature...<br />however, as it is, it&#039;s a borderline scam as NTFS speeds are a measly 3 mb/s write and 7 mb/s read, which makes it 100% useless as a &quot;big file repo&quot; as I intended!</p><p>Formatting the drive as FAT32 helped a bit as now sequential transfers manage to reach a 13 mb/s speed both writing and reading, but it&#039;s still far worse than the drive speed which is around 20 mb/s... and now it doesn&#039;t support big files at all.<br />I&#039;ve also tried formatting the drive to ext2,3 and 4 but none was supported, apparently.</p><p>I don&#039;t think the bottleneck is the USB 2.0 as it&#039;s max should be around 40, and when connected to my pc the drive can still reach max speed... it can&#039;t be the LAN itself too, as it reached 110 mb/s with SSD to SSD.<br />So, I guess it has to be one between a really slow CPU, not enough RAM, a terrible USB2.0 implementation, or maybe all 3.</p><p>So, do you think that switching to OpenWRT and formatting the drive with something like Ext4 would help reaching the drive max speed?<br />Has anyone attempted sharing volumes with this router at all, or it was just a really bad idea on my part to fall for it? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>Thanks!</p><p>EDIT: just to clarify, I only used the stock firmware for now!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tommo</strong> on 13 Jan 2013, 15:23)</p>

					<p>I mean that I formatted my drive with MBR with a single ext2/3/4 partition, and with the stock firmware it wasn&#039;t recognized.<br />It kept saying &quot;no USB volumes found&quot; no matter what, so I tought that they weren&#039;t supported... which is weird indeed if the stock firmware is linux-based.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tommo</strong> on 13 Jan 2013, 15:21)</p>
