					<p>Hello Everybody, </p><p>I&#039;m fairly new with openwrt and have been struggling with it for the past few days fulltime. The end goal is to set up MultipathTCP on two routers (TP-Link WDR3600, ar71xx) and create a VPN tunnel between them (over mptcp). </p><p>In order to achieve this, I first followed this <a href="http://&quot;http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/mptcp">wiki-article</a>. I installed a virtual machine, walke through the build-guide and build my version of openwrt with mptcp-support included. After installing on the routers, I noticed that the kernel version is 3.10.49, (Barrier Breaker?) although I am greeted with &#039;Chaos Control&#039; when I log in via ssh. I updated the opkg configuration file and pointed it to the Barrier Breaker sources (was /snapshots/trunk), because otherwise, the kmod-tun package that i need for OpenVPN did not match my kernel version.</p><p>Now, when I install kmod-tun, the kernel version matches, but I still get a dependency error. I used -force-depends to ignore those, because I read somewhere that you will always get this error if you compile an openwrt-version yourself. </p><p>On goes: I installed and configured openvpn-openssl using the above mentioned wiki together with the &quot;openvpn for beginners&quot; wiki, and after some debugging, finally got the server running. Client seems to be configured correctly as well, but now when I start openvpn on the client (and it connects to the server), both routers crash and reboot (into some half working state). Only power-cycling them brings them back to life again. </p><p>I logged the openvpn output to a permanent location but for as far as I can see, there is nothing strange in there. I read somewhere that OpenVPN-crashes (when first packets are send) often have to do with kernal module incompatibilities, which leads me to my -force-depends install of kmod-tun, but if I used the wrong version, then which version do I have to use?</p><p>If anybody can help me with the above, I would be very very very gratefull. I am doing this for my bachelor project and deadline is approaching fast. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Remco</p><p>Attachments:<br /><strong>OpenVPN Config Server:</strong><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config openvpn &#039;mptcp&#039;

					<p>i think the probles lies with you building this yourself and there might be something going wrong, as you said the linux version does not match CC builds.</p><p>Be sure to figure out what feed (stable, BE, RC1) you download and build that, also, once you have compiled your own kernel, packages might fail to isntall when using the openwrt package feed in opkg due to signature mismatch, so build everything you need in the package, or simply use the prebuild images from openwrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you YoYellow, I recompiled the entire firmware and included kmod-tun and openvpn this time. This resolved the problem. It is good to know that the openwrt package feed packages can fail with self-compiled kernel (although version number is equal). Is there a way to access the package feed that was also used when building the kernel? I cloned this openwrt source: <a href="https://github.com/xedp3x/openwrt">https://github.com/xedp3x/openwrt</a> but I am unable to find the appropriate package-feeds from that source. </p><p>Or is it impossible to seamlessly install packages on a self-compiled version of OpenWRT?</p><p>Thanks a million. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>the feed does not fail, its simple a signature mismatch because when you build your own kernel, any package that needs a specific kernelcomponent will want to know that hes talkign to the right version of the kernel, hence the signature</p><p>if you want to later install packages, you should build them as a module when you are building your own image/kernel. Meaning it is possible, but you have to build the packages yourself, host them yourself and tell opkg to look for your own hosted files</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yoyellow</strong> on 27 May 2015, 20:54)</p>
