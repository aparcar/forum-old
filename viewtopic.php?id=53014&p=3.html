I did upgrade to 16mb and it works fine. Requires some new patches which I hope to publish soon. Thing is, what&#039;s really needed is more RAM (at least for my apps). Unfortunately, the address pin needed isn&#039;t routed as far as I can tell so it&#039;s going to be rather difficult to expand the RAM.</p><p>One other note that may be of interest to those who have bricked your units is I&#039;ve found that I can flawlessly program the flash in-circuit (i.e. without removing the flash chip). Very convenient. I use flashrom, the TIAO Tumpa (USB Multi-Protocol Adapter), and one of these: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/SOIC8-SOP8-Flash-Chip-IC-Test-Clips-Socket-Adpter-BIOS-24-25-93-Programmer-/141377097279?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item20eabb4e3f">http://www.ebay.com/itm/SOIC8-SOP8-Flas … 20eabb4e3f</a></p><p>I&#039;ve found the in-circuit method to be much quicker and easier than TFTP.</p><p>Cheers...</p>									</div>

I noticed a br-0 interface in the configuration, but didn&#039;t look at it any closer. Is this bridge trying to span the WiFi as well and then fails to initialize (and thus set the IP) if WiFi is unavailable? Is there a chance that the LAN interface is brought up in some default configuration instead that I might be able to use to fix things? Or will I have to crack the device open and hook into the serial interface?</p><br /><p>@wingspinner, how difficult would it be to get the failsafe mode working in your patch? Is this something I could help with if you give me some quick pointers (I have quite a bit of coding experience, albeit not too much embedded stuff) or would it be more involved? I (and probably others, too) would feel a lot safer playing around with the configuration if I could always just do a &quot;factory reset&quot; (firstboot) easily if something gets screwed up.</p><p>Thanks again for all your work!

Failsafe appeared to be causing some odd behavior while I was debugging plus it takes some flash space so I removed it early on and never bothered to mess with it. The trunk upgrade version does include failsafe though (but that doesn&#039;t help you). There are a few options though that come to mind.</p><p>1. Upgrade with an &quot;upgrade&quot; image - either one of mine or from the trunk - using TFTP. The HT-TM02 ip address will be 10.10.10.123 and the server will need to be 10.10.10.3 .</p><p>2. Connect the serial - no password required.&nbsp; By far the easiest (at least for me since I have all the stuff to do it in 5 minutes)</p><p>3. I can&#039;t remember if the original image has the busybox ftp or not but if it does, you may be able to get in though that and use it to modify the passwd file. </p><p>4. Otherwise it&#039;s standard linux &quot;lost password&quot; stuff you can google.</p><p>For many people it&#039;s probably a good idea to upgrade first thing to the trunk image after booting my initial factory image so you&#039;ll have failsafe capability.</p>									</div>

I checked and I did include support for the mode switch in the DTS. So it is in there but how it get&#039;s used is dependent on what you want it to do. My guess is you want to be able to switch from adapter mode to AP mode. The openwrt folks have provided a mechanism that allows one to customize any switch or button however one wishes but it will take a bit of work on your part. A good place to start is here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/hardware.button">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/hardware.button</a></p><p>Cheers,</p>									</div>

If it&#039;s a basic Rt5350 SOC like the TM02 it should work otherwise. If you plan to use my &quot;factory&quot; image the tm01 would need to be able to accept the same firmware upgrade image format as the TM02.&nbsp; If the HooToo tm01 uses the same firmware upgrade image format there is still a good chance that it checks to make sure the image is for the tm02 before loading it. In that case it would fail and the &quot;factory&quot; image would need to be modified so that it specifies tm01 in the image header and cksum recalculated and updated. If you can verify that there is no additional hardware on the various peripheral I/O&#039;s and the &quot;factory&quot; firmware image formate then there is a good chance it would work. Since none of this has been checked out it&#039;s an &quot;experiment&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>I appreciate how helpfull everyone has been on this thread. Work has been crazy so I&#039;m just now getting back to this. I think uploading an image via TFTP is going to be my only way back in. I have a TFTP server set up but I&#039;m not clear on what file I need upload.</p>									</div>

					<p>Before continuing, I&#039;d just like to add my thanks to Wingspinner and others who have contributed to this body of work - long may it continue.</p><p>My issue is as follows:</p><p>I&#039;ve installed Wingspinner&#039;s &#039;factory image&#039; on the HooToo TM2 and can successfully use the device to access a WiFi network via the cabled lan interface. However, my objective, is to use the TM2 as a OpenVPN client where the WAN is the cabled interface and the LAN is wireless. I&#039;ve successfully configured OpenVPN (BB) on a TP-Link MR3020 in this manner and it functions very well - The only downside, is that it was necessary to add external USB storage to the MR3020, as it only has 4Mb of flash, which is too small to install the OPenVPN packages - the device is also approx twice the physical size of the TM2.</p><p>I&#039;ve now acquired a HooToo TM2 and am trying to configure it in the same way as the MR3020. </p><p>By following the same configuration process, I am able to access the TM2 wifi interface on the lan, but the cabled WAN interface (in dhcp client mode) does not seem to be picking up an IP address from the external router. So... My question is, are there any additional patches or packages (other than those ultimately required to run OpenVPN) that need to be applied to the &quot;openwrt-ramips-rt305x-ht-tm02-squashfs-factory-r42649.bin&quot; factory build, in order to get the basic networking aspects of my desired configuration working properly?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any insights or contributions...</p><p>TM</p>									</div>

You&#039;ll likely need to reconfigure the network, wireless, and firewall configuration files though to match what is required for openVPN. The default configuration is as a &quot;routed bridge&quot; (although bridge is an incorrect term in this instance however that&#039;s what the OpenWRT wiki calls it) with the wifi set as wan and the ethernet set as the local network.</p>									</div>
