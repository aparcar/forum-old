					<p>Greetings to all bros and sis !</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have trouble in configuring a bond inetrface in my Gateworks board running with OpenWrt&#039;s Kamikaze latest trunk. I enabled the bond driver and i was able to bring up a bond0 interface&nbsp; using &#039;ifconfig bond0 195.168.1.30 up&#039; command. But there was no effect on the system , I couldnt even ping it from my eth0 Iface. I have four radio&nbsp; interfaces too, for which I&nbsp; would be using this bond interface to be the master.</p><p>I see no config files related to bond interface in /etc/..</p><br /><p>regards and thank you all</p>									</div>
