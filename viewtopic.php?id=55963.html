					<p>To me, one of the major attractions of Open-WRT was the ability to configure without a gui.&nbsp; If you just need ethernet, wifi and&nbsp; the ability to route packets and can edit configuration scripts, the image should comfortably fit.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 21 Apr 2017, 17:53)</p>
