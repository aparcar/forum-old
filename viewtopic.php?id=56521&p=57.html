					<p>It is great to see that you are getting into the Device Pages, and including Data Entry-data dynamically!<br />The tab boxes look great, and they have potential.</p><p>Regarding the WNDR3700 page...<br />Hardware Higlights, OpenWrt Support and Firmware Downloads work pretty nice!<br />Links... lacks headers for each device... a Matrix/Table, not showing the entire link, just &quot;link&quot; would have been nice, but perhaps it is too much to ask?<br />Hardware details... I think the idea with the tabs is that it should all easily be visible on a single screen. My screen is 1366x768... and it does not fit <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>It seems to be quite the same result for WNDR3800.</p><p>I guess the purpose with the tab box is make the page easier to navigate (by not having very much tabular detailed data to scroll by). So each tab should be kept reasonably small, and they should have quite the same size as well, to help readability.</p><p>The primary/default tab...<br />Maybe SoC, WLAN Hardware and Modem are not needed.<br />Perhaps we should include Current Release instead.<br />...I dont know... just some gut feeling... we need to have a clear idea of what we want to achieve, so the result is consistant rather than confusing.</p><p>It already looks good, and I see plenty of potential (to hide, yet make easily available, information that otherwise takes up too much space and attention at first).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for that useful information! I could maybe give you some suggestions in changing the wiki-page of TL-WR710N:<br />In the hardware highlights: Mark that v2.1 is not supported since 15.05, but only by current snapshot, because 1.x images do not work, even though v2.1 has 8MB flash (same as 1.x). <br />Hence the following sentence is not true (different hardware-revision?) : <br />&quot;v2.1 is basically a re-issue of the v1.2.&quot;<br />In &quot;Hardware Images&quot; the following sentence is wrong:<br />15.05 Chaos Calmer:<br /> v1.x and v2.1: (Image links)<br />Pls change to v1.x ONLY!</p><p>Maybe additionally info (see quote from <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33908&amp;p=3):">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … &amp;p=3):</a><br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Hi, I managed to get trunk firmware into my V2.1 router by doing the following changes to my trunk setup:</p><p>Change the standard settings in target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile</p><p>define Device/tl-wr710n-v1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; $(Device/tplink-8mlzma)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BOARDNAME := TL-WR710N<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DEVICE_PROFILE := TLWR710<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TPLINK_HWID := 0x07100002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TPLINK_HWREV := 0x00000002<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONSOLE := ttyATH0,115200<br />endef</p><p>But what I have shown here is just a temporary fix, since the V2.1 version is as I understand the same as V1.2 except that that the HWREV is increased from 1 to 2.</p><p>Both V1.x , and V2.1 has 8 Mb of flash, but V2.0 has only 4Mb so I don&#039;t know what is the best way of defining this in the Makefile.</p><p>Since I&#039;m a total newbie at messing around with the source code, is there someone who can commit a correct change to trunk?</p></blockquote></div><p>Since i am also a total newbie, can someone pls tell me who is responsible for the builds listet in downloads.openwrt.org!<br />Are current unsupported devices going to be supported afterwards by recent releases (will there be in the future any CC-images for TL-WR710N v2.1)??<br />And if NOT: When will the next stable release (after Chaos Calmer) being submitted (give some suggestion)?<br />I don&#039;t want to run my device with the current snapshot, dont want to risk a brick. ;-)<br />Thanks in advance</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pato</strong> on 22 Jan 2016, 18:37)</p>
