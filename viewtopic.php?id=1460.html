					<p>Ok, so my brother gives me his old WRT54G v1.1 that had a bad flash. Said I can keep it if I can get it to work. I uploaded &quot;openwrt-wrt54g-jffs2.bin&quot; through tftp in windows. I was able to telnet into the router once and I set the password. But now through a series of events I&#039;m left with a flashing power light again and I am still able to ping the router by doing the 15/16 pin trick. (I get an increasing ping up to 999ms and then it starts back at 1ms)&nbsp; Going to the router&#039;s address in my browser brings up the openwrt page that says:</p><p>No webpages currently available<br />-perhaps you need to install a package?</p><p>My DMZ light doesn&#039;t come on at all and I&#039;m lost here. I don&#039;t really know how to use linux but this firmware was the only option. I was kind of hoping I could get an official firmware back on after getting this to work, but I think I may be in over my head. Can anyone shed some light on this for me? Is it a brick or is there still hope?</p><p>Edit: I managed to somehow get the power light to stay lit and the WLAN light as well. However the DMZ light never comes on (isn&#039;t it supposed to with openwrt?) Also, I can now ping it without using the 15/16 trick and it pings &lt;1ms all the time.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shadowchild</strong> on 9 May 2005, 21:23)</p>

					<p>Well lucky me. It works now. I would still like to put an official firmware release on it though, as openwrt is a little too advanced for me. Can anyone help with how to do that?</p><p>Edit: Yes my router does work. I think I have been at this project for too long. My brain is fried. =P<br />Also, DHCP does work.
