( though 1 image linked is broken )</p><br /><p>Wiki Says &quot;To get the serial connection work reliably, you have to connect a 10k pullup resistor between the TX and the 3.3V pin. This is because the TX pin is connected to a voltage divider (2x5.6k) and a capacitor is put between the real pin and the TX connector&quot;</p><br /><p>What is 10k Pullup resistor. Where i can find this? Is it available on Ebay.in or Ebay.com ?</p>									</div>
