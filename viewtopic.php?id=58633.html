					<p>I think it is very uncommon that the DSL-parts of any device is supported. Perhaps it is better you leave your DSL device with its factory firmware, configure it in &quot;bridge&quot; mode or whatever they call it, and put a compatible OpenWrt-router behind it (that is how my network is configured).</p><p>If you want to contribute to supporting it:<br /> 1) Document it. Add what you know on the wiki. Create a device page. Put information there. If you open your device and photograph the internals that can help also (perhaps someone else already did it and you can find pictures on wikidevi or somewhere).<br /> 2) Donate a device to a developer.</p><p>There is information on the Wiki about how to support a new device. It is probably built on an already known and working Platform + target.</p>									</div>

					<p>Many Lantiq-based DSL router/modems support the DSL side of things with OpenWrt. I don&#039;t think any others are supported. Your advice is good in general though, but there are some slight advantages for SQM QoS using a router with a supported integrated modem.</p>									</div>
