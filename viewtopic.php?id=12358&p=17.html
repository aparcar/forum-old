					<p>Hi, I just wanted to also add that my experience was pretty much the same than with Watha, I was using linksys original firmware 2.0.0.19 and european v.2.1 wrt350n. One thing that makes me extremely happy is that the routing speed seems to be much faster than with the stock firmware, I have 100mb/100mb wan connection so it was pretty quickly obvious. My thanks go to the people that have made this possible.</p>									</div>

I GUESSED at the 0xff900000 value, (0xff800000 + the 100000 hex value for the tftp&#039;d file.) it&#039;s the offsets that make it so hard to calculate...</p><p>I really think it would be a good idea to host some files for which the MTD sizes would be KNOWN and n00bs like myself could be given cut n&#039; paste command lines which have been pre calculated.</p><p>Never underestimate human stupidity!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>DaBigMac</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DaBigMac</strong> on 30 Aug 2009, 18:38)</p>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Regards to the heroes of hardware.</p><p>A question: I don&#039;t have a WRT350n yet, but am drawn to it by its hardware specs. I want a energy efficient NAS that can do assorted other odd jobs on the side, and the WRT350n looks killer for the job. However, there has been some muttering about USB stability/speed on (much) earlier pages of this thread. Can anyone confirm that USB storage will work well on this beastie, and even better, post some idea of NFS/CIFS throughput from USB? Also, any idea how many watts this might suck at idle?</p><p>Than in advance.</p>									</div>
