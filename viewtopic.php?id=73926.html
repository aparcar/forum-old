					<p>Hello<br />I flashed <strong>openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin</strong> to my TL-WR703N clone. I understand the GUI cannot work since I got only 4MB flash memory. I guess I should have flashed the command-line-only version.</p><p>On power-up the green LED starts a ~25 seconds blinking sequence and then remains green. Is my router bricked now? Or is there a way to establish a LAN connection again?</p><p>Best regards,<br />Nirwana</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nirwana</strong> on 24 Apr 2018, 11:23)</p>

					<p>Thank you very much! I&#039;m back in :-)</p><p>The hard reset I did yesterday must have cleared all my stupid settings so I&#039;m fresh again.

3   type uci set network.lan.dns=&#039;dns-address-here&#039; and press Return
4   type uci commit &amp;&amp; service network restart (this will save the changes and restart network interfaces)
5   the ssh session will not work anymore because the device has changed address, this is normal
6   now you can connect the network cable from the device&#039;s LAN port to your existing network (the other router&#039;s LAN ports usually)
