					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>Asterisk on my Danube reference board starts fine but I have a problem connecting to the Asterisk CLI using &quot;asterisk -r&quot;. </p><p>Asterisk Version - 1.4.22<br />Enabled Asterisk-mini; also enabled asterisk-core and asterisk-cli modules</p><p>Behavior <br />Asterisk runs fine when the board comes up, but when I try to connect to the Asterisk command line by saying &quot;asterisk -r&quot;, it does not give me a CLI prompt to enter the commands. I have to do a Ctrl C to come out of it.</p><p>I have confirmed that the ncurses library is present on the board and that asterisk.pid and asterisk.ctl files are present in /var/run/asterisk</p><p>Looking for some suggestions</p><p>Thanks,<br />Chaitra</p>									</div>
