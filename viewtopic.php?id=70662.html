					<p>I just finished installing openwrt on a linksys e4200v2. Everything went ok and I attempted to configure it as a bridge repeater. However when I ran a &quot;scan&quot; and &quot;join&quot; the main wifi a problem came up. Now the wireless tab shows a message &quot;wireless is disabled or not associated&quot; . I tried on luci to click disable/enable again but to no avail. I will appreciate any help.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danielsender</strong> on 20 Apr 2017, 04:44)</p>

					<p>You can&#039;t put a regular client mode interface into a bridge.&nbsp; Use routed client instead.&nbsp; Make sure your wan or wwan interface is not a bridge, and the client is the only thing in it.</p><p>For a true bridge across an AP-client wifi connection, the AP needs to support WDS mode, then you can use client-WDS.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you please tell me how to proceed to do that? This is my first experience with openwrt. In the past I used dd-wrt with other routers and I was able to configure them as &quot;repeater bridge&quot;. Is that equivalent to&nbsp; &quot;routed client&quot;?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t like the Join button script which makes a new interface, etc.&nbsp; That is unnecessarily complicated.<br />Start with a default configuration<br />Manually create a client mode wifi interface-- enter the SSID and encryption settings for the AP you are going to get Internet from.&nbsp; Put it in the &#039;wan&#039; network.<br />Go to Network - Interfaces - Edit button for WAN - Physical Settings.&nbsp; Uncheck Bridge.&nbsp; Select the wifi interface you created.<br />Go to the main status page you should see an IPv4 WAN connection has become active.&nbsp; If the AP gave you an address in 192.168.1.X you will need to change your LAN IP to a different range before it can route to the internet.<br />You can connect the now unused wan ethernet interface to the LAN bridge to use all 5 ports for wired devices.<br />You can of course create an AP mode wifi.&nbsp; OpenWrt does not enable an AP when first started.&nbsp; Note that if you lose the connection to the ISP AP, the other AP will go off the air and you will need a wired connection to log into the router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 Apr 2017, 05:20)</p>

					<p>Before selecting the type of configuration I must get the wireless to work - The 2.4GHz band is not working while the 5GHz does. I checked with &quot;uci show wireless&quot; and I don&#039;t see any instance of the word &quot;disabled&quot;, I even tried setting &quot;disabled=0&quot; but it didn&#039;t do anything. I wonder if there is any other knob to turn on the radio.<br />Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>danielsender</strong> on 20 Apr 2017, 10:15)</p>

					<p>Finally I gave up on setting openwrt with the Luci interface. IMHO it is not very intuitive. I just followed the instructions on forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077 using the CLI - Everything went fine, and the repeater bridge works flawlessly.</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>									</div>

					<p>@mk24 than you for that final bit of clarification. I&#039;m a novice but the reply was much appreciated. Now my network is working at 2.4ghz, although I had one question.</p><p>is there a reason that only certain channels, for example 2, work better and turn the broadcasting on? the settings I inputted in my last reply chose channel 11, but actually channel 11 did not work. What it did do was make it so I could switch channells, to 2 in this case.</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know why channel 11 would not work.&nbsp; It is allowed in all countries.</p><p>You should scan to see which channels your neighbors are using, then choose a channel that avoids them.&nbsp; Choose from the group of channels 1, 6, and 11.&nbsp; &nbsp;A scan can be done from the web UI or with <strong>iwinfo wlan0 scan</strong> on the command line.</p><p>HT40 only works if you have no neighbors in the extra channel group.&nbsp; Almost all installations should use HT20 instead.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 14 Sep 2017, 21:22)</p>
