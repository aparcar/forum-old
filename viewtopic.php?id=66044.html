					<p>Hi gents,</p><p>could someone who knows how to do this, do a build from the head of the trunk for lantiq-xrx200-TDW<strong>9980</strong>?</p><p>The page for 9980 points to 15.05.1 release for TDW<strong>8970</strong>, which has two major flaws:</p><ul><li><p>VDSL doesn&#039;t work</p></li><li><p>2.4G Wifi doesn&#039;t work (I understand 5G wifi not working is expected)</p></li></ul><p>I&#039;d be more than happy to provide any information that would be of any use; since I have the serial connection working, I can do a quite a few things (for instance, I was able to dump ~most of~ the live filesystem, tar czvf-ing most of it to a usb stick - had to skip /sys, /proc/kcore and the mountpoints for the usb stick obviously).</p><p>Best regards,<br />Mircea</p><p>PS. Here&#039;s the FS dump, the mtd&#039;s, and a bunch of info (including the log of me reflashing stock after the wrt fail, and the thing booting - up until VDSL was up): <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx8sxpzTPNPYTndHbzFmZWRoTWM/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx8sxp â€¦ sp=sharing</a></p><p>PPS. I&#039;d happily settle for instructions on how to do it myself - I can do C and makefiles, but I get lost once i hit kconfig&#039;s and the like.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mionica</strong> on 7 Jul 2016, 03:01)</p>

					<p>Ummm ok. Since nobody was apparently interested, I ended up doing it myself.</p><p>Build available at <a href="http://mionica.ro/openwrt/lantiq/xrx200/">http://mionica.ro/openwrt/lantiq/xrx200/</a>, should anyone be interested. Pretty much what you&#039;d expect; LuCI is built-in, as is openvpn-client.</p><p>Note: if using IPoE, set your wan/wan6 to the ptm0.X interface, where X is the VLAN number you&#039;re assigned. No need to mess with the switch settings, as I found out (the hard way); there&#039;s also no need to declare a ptm0.X interface anywhere, it just works - apparently.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mionica</strong> on 10 Jul 2016, 14:01)</p>
