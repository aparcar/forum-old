					<p>Sorry for the false alarm. The TTL to serial adapter I am using is 5v so I am powering it separately with a 5v power adapter. it was not plugged in and thus not powering the TTL adapter properly when I made that last post. even though it was not powered it still gave feedback from the router. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
