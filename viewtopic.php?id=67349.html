					<p>As an Archer C7 v2 owner I am considerng which firmware to use.</p><p>Current OpenWrt snapshots contain firmware-5.bin_<strong>10.2.4.97-1</strong>, which seems fairly new, looking at <a href="http://source.codeaurora.org/quic/qsdk/oss/firmware/ath10k-firmware/plain/10.2.4/.">source.codeaurora.org/quic/qsdk/oss/fir … n/10.2.4/.</a></p><p>However, when I look at Kalle Valo&#039;s (apparently a QC employee) github at <a href="http://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/tree/master/QCA988X/hw2.0/10.2.4.70">github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/tree/m … /10.2.4.70</a>, which is the recommended place to get up-to-date firmware for our radios, the most recent blob is firmware-5.bin_<strong>10.2.4.70.54</strong>.</p><p>Which one is actually more recent? The numbers indicate that .97 should be more recent, but it also looks like the .70.x line is still getting updates as well. Kvalo&#039;s .70.x line also comes with more features like raw-mode (for mesh networks) and mfp (frame protection) which the .97 firmware doesn&#039;t have.</p><p>This may seem like nitpicking from my side as both blobs work fine, but I am really curious about why the higher numbered blobs miss certain features and why openwrt uses them instead of kvalo&#039;s. Anybody has an idea?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knizmi</strong> on 14 Sep 2016, 11:15)</p>

					<p>Looks like I wasn&#039;t the only one who was wondering abut the FW versions and there is a discussion about it in the mailing list with some answers. If anybody bumped into this forum thread, go to <a href="http://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2016-September/042166.html.">lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-dev … 2166.html.</a></p><p>TLDR - The 10.2.4.70.x branch from kvalo&#039;s repo is the FW you want to use.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>knizmi</strong> on 14 Sep 2016, 11:03)</p>
