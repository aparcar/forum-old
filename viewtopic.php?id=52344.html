					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am creating rules to set a transfer quota for a hoston my lan. It should be applied only to data to and from &#039;wan&#039;. What I observe is that only the request gets treated by the rule, and not the whole exchange.</p><p>Starting from the default setup of firewall (fw3) from Breaking Barrier, I set the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -N limit
iptables -A limit -m quota2 --name foo --quota 30000 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A limit -j DROP

iptables -A forwarding_rule -s 192.168.1.246 -j limit
iptables -A forwarding_rule -d 192.168.1.246 -j limit</code></pre></div><p>Doing a test transfer from the host, which is about 20k<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>wget -q google.com</code></pre></div><p>Checking the change on the quota, only 120 bytes are taken<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -L limit
Chain limit (2 references)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             -m quota --name foo  --quota 29880
DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere</code></pre></div><p>I guess what I have written only applies to the packets initiating the request. How could I make a rule to be applied on all the packets?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I did the following experiment:</p><p>1. Restart the firewall (fw3 through /etc/init.d/firewall restart) to reset all the iptables counter,<br />2. Do a Google image seach for &quot;carrot cake&quot; from a host on my lan and let it load all the visible images,<br />3. check the iptables counters (iptables -vL).</p><p>The chains &quot;INPUT&quot; and &quot;FORWARD&quot; reached about 20k each while &quot;OUTPUT&quot; was around 3K (*). Not at all the values I was expecting for a page filled with delicious carrot cake pictures.</p><p>So it seems that the data sent after a request from my NAT&#039;ted host doesn&#039;t go through the iptables. Could someone confirm on this?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>*) If you arrive at different values, my teenager might be have contributed to this traffic</p>									</div>

					<p>I went around the different tables and noticed that &#039;mangle&#039; was getting lots of data.</p><p>Setting up with the following<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t mangle -N limit_mangle_forward;
iptables -t mangle -A limit_mangle_forward -m quota2 --name foo_forward --quota 40000 -j ACCEPT;
iptables -t mangle -A limit_mangle_forward -j DROP;


iptables -t mangle -I FORWARD -s 192.168.1.246 -j limit_mangle_forward;
iptables -t mangle -I FORWARD -d 192.168.1.246 -j limit_mangle_forward;
iptables -t mangle -vL;</code></pre></div><p>After this, I did &quot;wget google.com&quot; which saved a local &quot;index.html&quot; of size 19542. Then the quota counter was down to 16595 bytes, meaning 23405 bytes where consumed, which is more than consistent with the size of the file received.</p><p>I would be very grateful if someone could suggest a command where the total byte size of the query and response would be known in advance so I could validate that I&#039;m not missing anything.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
