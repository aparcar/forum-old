					<p>Starting Friday May 14th till Sunday May 16th, 2010 freifunk.net, c-base and the German wireless community invites everyone to the &quot;Freifunk Wireless Community Weekend&quot; at the c-base space station in Berlin (<a href="http://www.c-base.org">www.c-base.org</a>).<br />As in previous years, the organizers will provide open spaces for the participants in the c-base to discuss and work on projects. Later at night there will be a number of special guests presenting the latest creative projects and innovative hits - and of course it will be a must to attend legendary freifunk BBQ. </p><p>Several OpenWrt developers will attend the event, and they will have time for work and socializing.</p><p>Further information is found at:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.freifunk.net/Wireless_Community_Weekend_2010">http://wiki.freifunk.net/Wireless_Commu â€¦ ekend_2010</a></p>									</div>
