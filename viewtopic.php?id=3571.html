					<p>Heyas,<br />&nbsp; just wondering if anybody else is still experiencing occasional wifi dropouts in RC4?</p><p>I have 2x 54GS v1.1 models bought together and judging by MACs and serials were manufactured very close to the same date. All NVRAM settings are identical but one causes occasional problems. I&#039;ve changed clock speeds (200vs216) and swapped the 2routers to no avail. They&#039;re set up in WDS with WPA-PSK.</p><p>It doesn&#039;t reboot, but looking at the signal bar in iStumbler (OSX) there&#039;s definite restarts of the interface. The main nuisance is with WindowsXP machines (all drivers updated) but I think that&#039;s more because of the way it behaves upon wifi dropouts.</p><p>The syslog appears clean, no clues there. Can anybody suggest additional packages that would help debugging or a series of tests to track down the problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>Do you have more than one wireless client? Does it happen with all of them? I have several WPC55AG cards and one of them exhibits the same behavior you are describing (so my card is obviously bad). Just curious if you had eliminated it as a possibility.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had problems with RC3, again with only the one router. The script (that was integrated into RC4) made no discernable difference.</p><p> As soon as I&#039;d upgraded both to RC4 I was testing the &#039;high-load&#039; situation by dragging 2 different 500+mb files across the link, one to a PC and one to a Mac, side-by-side on the same bench. In this case the iBook downloaded fine even while the PC stalled after a short while and dropped the link to the router, minutes later the iBook did the same.<br /> This got me initially thinking that it was a problem was with the PC (drivers, hardware issue, etc) as the iBook continued downloading. When the iBook stalled and dropped the transfer I began thinking it was a timeout problem, but I don&#039;t know the details of the ACKs/NACKs/Stacks involved (just enough to know i don&#039;t know enough!).</p><p> Either way, there are times when while watching the signal with a wifi sniffer (iStumbler) on the Mac, i see the signal drop and the PC laptop complains that the wifi connection was dropped, 10seconds later the router&#039;s wifi powers back up and all is fine again (for a while).</p><p> My thinking is that it&#039;s not simply a client problem as it presents on different platforms and in different ways at the same time. I haven&#039;t yet swapped the routers positions or tried it without WPA encryption (or WPA, WEP etc) but these are my next testing steps.</p><p> Until then, are there any additional packages or ways to watch the wifi interface for clues?</p>									</div>
