					<p>I&#039;m trying to build a custom firmware with DHCP disabled (to use for an AP), But no matter what I do, this router will always assign an IP to my computer, I&#039;ve also disabled dhcp via Luci, but got same result. I followed the wiki and came up with this configuration to disable dhcp:</p><p>/etc/config/dhcp<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dhcp lan

    option interface    lan

    option limit    150

    option interface    wan
    option ignore    1</code></pre></div><p>/etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;
