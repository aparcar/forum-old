					<p>Hello,</p><p>On Linksys-routers the high-bandwidth-issue is fixed. Thanks for that. I&#039;m just interested if anyone can confirm that White Russian fixed the &quot;crash-on-high-bandwidth&quot;-issue also on Asus WL-500g (deluxe) routers. So, is it fixed?</p>									</div>

					<p>A test on a pair of asus wl-500g with an openwrt.cvs.head of Jun 15 07:42 EET which includes gcc-3.4.4 with a patched 2.4.31 linux kernel + Wireless Extentions v18 did not have this problem.&nbsp; Tested back-to-back with 1GB file transfer using senao/prism2 wifi miniPCI cards.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t test with the native broadcom wifi cards - I got my senao miniPCI for $35 a piece.</p>									</div>
