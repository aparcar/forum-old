What it does essentially is to take a snapshot of the relevant nvram settings that the firmware uses upon boot up and operation to run the router as you intend to. Afaics it does not backup the entire nvram, just the firmware specific values, but I guess I should go and find out what exactly gets backed up and restored...</p>									</div>

					<p>@lc:<br />I think the new power supplies are worth a try. If this does not work for you, do you have another universal power supply with more than 1A at 12V or can you get one? Maybe the quality of the original power supplies is not the best and they don&#039;t supply a solid current flow at the higher ampere rates.</p><p>@kebab:<br />I&#039;m sure that reducing transmit power hasn&#039;t got any significant effects on the overall power usage, altough enabling the wireless hardware itself has. One of my crashing access points has a transmit power of 13 dBm because I use 7 dBi antennas here, 13 dBm is about 20mW (<a href="http://home.in.tum.de/~prilmeie/wlan/db-umrechnung.php">http://home.in.tum.de/~prilmeie/wlan/db-umrechnung.php</a>). If I recall correctly the power supplies are DC, so we can use Ohm&#039;s law and have a maximum of 12W output at all, I don&#039;t think that 20mW or 100mW transmit power is the problem. If there is a problem with the power supplies, it&#039;s more likely that it has to do with stable current flow at the upper level.</p>									</div>

					<p>don&#039;t think it is the power supply since I use lots of wrt54gl v1.1 units, some with their normal Linksys wall adapter, and some with a homebrew battery based power supply; all are rock stable. Have not noticed differences relative to v1.0 and 54g v3.1 and 2.2 and 2.0 other than the radio being more sensitive in the models since 3.1.<br />Moreover the power setting does very little to over-all power consumption; you are talking tens of milliwatts there, relative to several watts of total consumption.<br />Have you tried removing all unessential applications ? E.g. I don&#039;t use webif.<br />Could it be the unit running out of resources during associations while also having to deal with lots of traffic ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not convinced about this power thing either, and kebab mentioned the best point why it likely not the case, but I think we should try everything to find the cause. <br />Most of the evidences we found point towards the binary only module and some special traffic patterns, the dumps from the kernel panics, doddel&#039;s installation without any probs where Linksys routers just talk to other Linksys routers, etc.</p><p>Btw, I already use a custom build of White Russian done with Imagebuilder without webif and other unneeded packages.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have tested with firmware images downloaded from the Openwrt web site and with custom firmware images with non-essential applications removed. With the custom firmware installed, free RAM was in excess of 5MBytes and load average was in the range of 0.00 to 0.10.

I can see it is happening on various locations, therefore I can tell that load/number of clients/uptime/amount of available memory has nothing to do with it. I once had a unit with a serial port on a site to get the console output. A small selection of the results are in this thread. I have spent weeks to find the exact reason and came to the same conclusion as others: once radio is turned off and an external AP is used, the WRTs run rock-stable. To be more concrete:&nbsp; It is not a matter whether radio is on or not - it is a question whether it is being used or not. What I mean is I have a WRT which bridges certain ports of the switch with eth1. Other APs are connected to it though the switch. Clients associate with those APs and almost never to the WRT. As a result this WRT runs like a charm without any problems.</p><p>That&#039;s why in the end we tried (unsuccessfully) to play with other wl.o versions as we thought that certain radio conditions cause wl.o to mess up memory. Especially the reports that this issue also occurs with linksys stock firmware point into this direction.</p><p>What I can offer is to put my WRT with the serial port back together with a notebook on a site which usually reboots 2-3 times a day (student place, high frequency of various clients). Maybe you have a program which writes kind of &quot;system trace&quot; to the console to find out what causes the memory corruption.</p><p>So far kebab is the only one who found a procedure to make the issue occur on purpose. This is not very much to find and fix it, but it is already much much better than what most of us achieved.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lc</strong> on 11 Apr 2007, 21:28)</p>
