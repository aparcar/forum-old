					<p>Hey there,</p><p>just installed the actual version of kamikaze on my new wrt54gl. Everything worked fine therefore I sticked over to network settings. </p><p>I set up a wlan with ssid, wpa2-psk and key. Set mode pppoe for wan (for connection to an adsl-modem). And set dhcp for lan and the land adress to 192.168.0.170 on 255.255.255.0. After that the router rebootet and I got an error on the webinterface saying that some tlx-headers were not found (or something like that - didn&#039;t understand it). <br />From that moment on the Router did not respond on anything anymore. The Webinterface did not show up on 192.168.1.1 nor on 192.168.0.170. It does not respond on ping attempts.</p><p>I tried switching to failsafe and entering via telnet on putty but I can&#039;t get a connection (timed out). Seems as if I&#039;ve looked myself out.</p><p>Has anyone an idea what to do?<br />thx netti</p>									</div>
