					<p>Well, how do you imagine to connect your analogue phone to your router without one? </p><p>Duct tape or wishful thinking won&#039;t do the trick. Even if you can physically cram a rj11 plug into an ethernet port, that won&#039;t magically make your analogue phone work. A digital ethernet port just isn&#039;t a 90 volt tolerant &quot;soundcard&quot;, even if it looks physically similar.</p>									</div>

Also if you can install a sip client in the router and plug the usb sound card u can make call by ssh and typing a script <br />to call other contact and maybe use the wifi button to hung on and up when u receive a call . thank you again boobot<br />for believing in my idea ,+1 haha</p>									</div>

					<p>Dear Mr -1, I hope you do realize that the router in question doesn&#039;t have USB ports...</p><p>...and even if it had a USB port, did you ever look at the prices for USB FXS adaptors? <br />You can get a standalone VoIP ATA with 4 FXS ports for less than the price of one such mystical USB FXS adaptor<br />or a 2-FXS ports VoIP ATA for less than half the price<br />or a complete router with FXS ports for just around that price.</p><p>This is all nice and dandy, if you have enough spare parts sitting on a shelf and don&#039;t have to pay for them, but retrofitting an underpowered router (a 320 MHz Broadcom SOC, BCM4313 wlan (does brcmsmac work sufficiently?), 32 MB RAM, 100 MBit/ ethernet only, no internal FXS support, no USB support, unclear status for the ADSL2 modem, OpenWrt support for this device seems to be rather basic in the first place) with all that? c&#039;mon.</p><p>So without FXS- or USB ports, we&#039;re back to duct tape and wishful thinking.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 5 Apr 2016, 23:44)</p>

					<p><strong>neo_dlink</strong>, I know for the fact that the opensource B43 driver was successfully recreated and debugged for OpenWrt few years ago. Now you are not constrained with v2.6 kernel any more.<br />Just read the AA release notes or news from that era.</p>									</div>
