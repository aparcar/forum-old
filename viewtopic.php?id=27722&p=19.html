It&#039;s usefull to switch off WLAN if it isn&#039;t in use.<br />- WAN LED is always orange. No Information given if the unit is online or not.<br />- LAN port priority. It&#039;s usefull for Skype/VoIP. No QoS! Just simple high or low priority!<br />- I&#039;d like to have a port forwarding mask due to incompetence from my side. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />- Maybe nmbd support ? for better usage of shares on Windows machines.</p><p>I know it&#039;s possible to forward ports via firewall rules. But I have no knowledge about firewalls. I just want avoid mistakes only!<br />For the other points I think there is already a solution!?

					<p>We have to remember that Arokh&#039;s build is already very complete and that there&#039;s very little room left on the flash to install additional packages. That is why we keep getting errors when trying to install stuff. The solutions for that are apparently to extroot (make the router run entirely from software on a usb-device) or to install only certain packages on usb. However, I have not yet tried it. There&#039;s guides about it on the internet though.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think some of us are missing the point. When the author of this firmware started this build he wrote &quot;I built it how it was useful for me&quot;. Now we have people coming here asking him to add this &amp; add that to an already perfect build. Guess what, if you keep trying to make him add stuff, that something is gonna break. If you want some feature I highly suggest you build your own and leave this work of art alone. Are you really that lazy that you can&#039;t log into the router and turn off the radios? Do you really have to have the author right a script and add it to the build making it bigger &amp; bigger &amp; bigger. QOS will make it bigger but if you have this beast of a router you really don&#039;t need qos, this beast has one of the best CPUs for cosumer grade routers, if you find you net struggling maybe you need to get a higher level of service from your ISP.</p><p>Sorry for the rant but it&#039;s perfect right now and all the extra crap will break it causing me or others to go back to stock or older &quot;original&quot; builds.</p><p>DD-WRT has all that crap and look how it runs, &quot;Like Shit&quot;!!</p>									</div>

					<p>I no longer ask for stuff, It was very clear to me back at page 1-4 that this firmware was built meeting the needs of Arokh, I have seen however that he has found some of the stuff that people request useful for himself in one way or another or has just added stuff that he would never use just so some of us are also pleased (extroot is a good example of this).</p><p>However I agree with your point and suggest people to start reading from post 1 to see what this threat is about.</p><p>My message above with the QoS errors are just for him in case he can read it and know right away what the error is. He is the &quot;maker&quot; of the build so he knows what the build can and cannot do.</p><p>Its also in case that someone else has tried and succeeded to instal QoS scripts on Arokh&#039;s build</p>									</div>

					<p>Erikk1 very good idea, i like to try out openwrt so i can use a guide en simple Q&amp;A because i&#039;m a noob at this kind of things <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Tried DD-wrt for a week and liked it, but needed the readyshare thing (to complicated for me in dd-wrt) so if that isn&#039;t so hard in openwrt (arokh build) i love to trie it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hjs</strong> on 31 Jan 2011, 22:45)</p>
