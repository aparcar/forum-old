There are strict kernel option checksums. In practice, if you do your own firmware builds, you can only install the modules compiled at the same compilation time. </p><p>You should use menuconfigto select the modules and compile all needed modules at the same time, and preferably also include them in the firmware image (that saves flash space due to compression).</p><p>Ps. that goes also for the &quot;official&quot; trunk snapshots etc. The checksum verification is really strict.

					<p>Telnet-&gt;firstboot worked. <br />I think i used the wrong port (not WAN) when i tried it the first time or something similar. </p><p>Thanks... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>1) Is there no hardware button combo or something like this doing the same?</p><p>2) There is no &#039;shutdown&#039; function in the UI so i guess just pulling power cord is ok? No unmount necessary for graceful shutdown?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HectoPascal</strong> on 15 Mar 2013, 18:15)</p>
