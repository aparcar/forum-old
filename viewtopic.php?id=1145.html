					<p>Hi everyone, I am a newbie on openwrt and have some problem when I set it up</p><p>First I can flash openwrt&nbsp; (snapshot 20050202) to my WRT54G v2 successfully then I want to set the openwrt as the gateway to internet and to different subet (have 4 ports at back to 4 different subent 192.168.1-4.XXX) Then my night mare begin</p><p>I use nvram to set vlan2 have port 2 then I reboot. After that, I can&#039;t ssh or telnet my WRT54G. I try failmode, but still can&#039;t ping it.<br />Then I try to shorten the 15&amp;16pin, now I can pin it when it boot up (only by WAN port) , but still can&#039;t telnet it</p><p>Then I re-flash openwrt to the router, but it still can&#039;t access the router and only answer ping message when it boot up.</p><p>After try many times, I restore the linksys firmware (ver 2.00.8). after flash it, the router still not accessable, but I can ping the router. I use nmap to scan the router and none of the port is open. I don&#039;t know what can I try now.<br />And how can I setup openwrt as gateway to internet, dhcp server to 4 different subnet</p><p>Please give me some advices, Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi </p><p>I was in a quite similar situation recently with the difference that my machine is a -GS model. </p><p>I couldn&#039;t telnet into the router after flashing it, not even in failsafe mode. </p><p>As a last resort I followed the instructions on voidman-is-a-geek&#039;s page and that did it. Shortening the pins at the right moment I was able re-flash it with a different firmware and now it works. </p><p>I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s all that you can try, too. But maybe one of the veterans here knows an alternative? </p><p>Cheers<br />D. O.</p>									</div>
