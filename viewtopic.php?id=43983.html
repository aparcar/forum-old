					<p>Well an other solution I didn&#039;t think of is have a redirect in the iptables, and a custom instance of uhttpd.</p><p>create the directory <strong>/www2</strong> on your router, and create a file named index.html within that directory with your page.</p><p>add to <strong>/etc/rc.local</strong> the following<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> uhttpd -h /www2 -E / -p 192.168.1.1:8000</code></pre></div><p>add to <strong>/etc/config/firewall</strong> the following<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect

					<p>the line of config wrote means that any domain request to dns server of router will be reply as &quot;10.10.10.10&quot; ip address, in dnsmasq config &quot;#&quot; is the wildcard charater, like &quot;*&quot; character in linux shell.</p><p>/etc/config/dhcp is the file of openwrt uci framework to config the options of dnsmasq.</p><p>all the documentation that it exists about dnsmasq is its man page. and the option of dnsmasq with that line of uci config is... (copied from man page of dnsmasq):</p><p>-A, --address=/&lt;domain&gt;/[domain/][&lt;ipaddr&gt;]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given domains. Queries in the domains are never forwarded and always replied to with the specified IP address which may be IPv4 or IPv6. To give both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a domain, use repeated -A flags. Note that /etc/hosts and DHCP leases override this for individual names. A common use of this is to redirect the entire doubleclick.net domain to some friendly local web server to avoid banner ads. The domain specification works in the same was as for --server, with the additional facility that /#/ matches any domain. Thus --address=/#/1.2.3.4 will always return 1.2.3.4 for any query not answered from /etc/hosts or DHCP and not sent to an upstream nameserver by a more specific --server directive. As for --server, one or more domains with no address returns a no-such-domain answer, so --address=/example.com/ is equivalent to --server=/example.com/ and returns NXDOMAIN for example.com and all its subdomains. </p><p><a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html">http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/do … q-man.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks KAHN85,</p><p>Thats A LOT of info to get my head around. :-)<br />I managed to lock myself out with my firewall config.&nbsp; I hope it only affects my wlan..&nbsp; So something is already working but i&#039;m not being redirect yet...&nbsp; Just not being able to connect over SSH and LuCI login also doed not accept the password(however the loginpage does load...)&nbsp; </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect
