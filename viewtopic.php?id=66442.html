					<p>If you are OK using a dongle any router with USB port will do. So pick your favourite one with as much memory/flash space you want. If you want one with built in 3G/4G modem it&#039;s a very limited choice.</p>									</div>

					<p>As others said, a decent device with RAM/Flash and USB port.&nbsp; I would also consider trying to use an Android phone via USB tether - as the 3G/4G radios in the Android phones are often better - more up to date - and inexpensive if you get a small phone without much in the way of screen size.</p>									</div>
