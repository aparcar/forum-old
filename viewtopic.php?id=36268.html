					<p>Hi guys.<br />I was using dd-wrt on this router, but I am migrating all of my routers to openwrt, at least trying to ....<br />As it has the same hardware of DIR-300 I am following <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300revb">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300revb</a> instructions<br />I am a newbie to openwrt, so excuse me if I made any obvious mistakes.<br />So I set-up a debian 6 32 bit box just for development and followed the instructions on <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a><br />and later<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a></p><p>The problem is that, I get no openwrt-*-squashfs-factory.bin file, only openwrt-*-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin file<br />So I tried many things, tried flashing this file anyway, tried using the v2image tool in the dlink tool kit,<br />since in the example it was converting a sysupgrade image to a &quot;webflash&quot; type image but I had no success, because I built trunk version from yesterday.</p><p>Thank Goddess that this router has that useful recovery firmware feature, otherwise I&#039;d had probably bricked my router lol<br />Did many many tries, with different builds of openwrt with no luck, now I got factory firmware back but I am definitely decided to install openwrt on this router, no matter the work.</p><p>So my question is, do I have to build a version pre r27808 and make use of the v2image from dlink tool<br />or is there a way I can make a build that will generate the &quot;from factory&quot; install firmware ?</p><p>This are the bin files that my built generated<br />-rwxr-xr-x 1 israelm israelm 2,4M Abr 17 11:58 openwrt-ramips-rt305x-vmlinux.elf<br />-rwxr-xr-x 1 israelm israelm 2,4M Abr 17 11:58 openwrt-ramips-rt305x-vmlinux.bin<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 israelm israelm 803K Abr 17 11:58 openwrt-ramips-rt305x-uImage.bin<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 israelm israelm 1,7M Abr 17 11:58 openwrt-ramips-rt305x-root.squashfs<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 israelm israelm 2,4M Abr 17 11:58 openwrt-ramips-rt305x-freestation5-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 israelm israelm&nbsp; 366 Abr 17 11:58 md5sums<br />drwxr-xr-x 2 israelm israelm 4,0K Abr 17 11:58 packages<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 israelm israelm 2,4M Abr 17 13:31 openwrt-dir600b2-squashfs-webflash.bin</p><p>the openwrt-dir600b2-squashfs-webflash.bin I generated doing the v2image thing, worthless... </p><p>I also didn&#039;t change almost anything on make menuconfig ncurses interface, installed no package<br />my intention is to first get openwrt installed and later do a &quot;customized&quot; build with the packages I need.</p><p>I only changed the configuration advised on the wiki <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300revb">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-300revb</a></p><p>So please any Dev Guru advise me which way to follow<br />1 do a pre r27808 build and use the v2image tool to see if it works ?<br />2 is there a way to force the build generate the &quot;factory&quot; firmware to be flashed from this ramips-rt305x ?</p><p>Thanks in advance!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>israel_miranda</strong> on 18 Apr 2012, 03:00)</p>

					<p>I didn&#039;t change the Target Profile, left it set to Default Profile</p><p>I admit the first image I tried I set a lot of options, but then I set as a goal to build a simple default image first changing the least options possible.<br />So I built a r27800/trunk version, since I guessed the problem was on the conversion thing of the firmware image format and I was right.<br />I build a default image, only setting the Target System as Ralink RT288x/RT305x and Subtarget as RT305x based boards.<br />And after building the image I used the v2image from dlink tool to convert the image and it worked.<br />Now I have openwrt installed and am trying to do a new build.</p><p>And it worked!!</p><p>So now I am trying to build a current trunk version to upgrade the firmware, and later want to try a build with openvpn,luci-pt-br and ipv6 support image.<br />I can do such a build to fit in only 4MB ?</p><p>Please give me the hints to compile the least things as possible and save space.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>israel_miranda</strong> on 21 Apr 2012, 20:28)</p>
