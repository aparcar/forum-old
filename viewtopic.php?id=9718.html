					<p>Hi</p><p>I&#039;ve bought a Linksys WRT54GS some years ago and I&#039;m now trying to install the OpenWRT firmware.<br />The model is named &quot;WRT54GS V1.1&quot; (well that&#039;s what is written on the back of my router), current (official) Firmware used Version 4.71.1.<br />I tried it with the recommened openwrt-wrt54gs-squashfs.bin using the webinterface but I get the error message &quot;Upgrade are failed&quot;. Resetting the router to system defaults with the reset-button works and I tried it several times using fresh downloads so I am sure the file is ok - always the same error.</p><p>Any ideas?</p>									</div>
