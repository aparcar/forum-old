					<p>Got a question here, I looked all over the forums and documents at xwrt and other sites, but couldent solve my problem.&nbsp; I am not new to using openwrt, but this hardware is new to me(WRT150N).</p><p>I flashed to OpenWRT kamikaze/7.06/brcm-2.4&nbsp; no problem.&nbsp; The only trouble is that now I want it reflashed to the default firmware.&nbsp; </p><p>The problem:<br />Web menu won&#039;t reflash the default linksys .bin<br />It DOES have boot wait on, so TFPT should do the trick..<br />At bootwait time, I can fire a firmware across and it says successful.<br />Reboot, same old openWRT. </p><p>I tried flashing with the reset button held, and various other methods that online sites reccomended, each time it says its successful, but no change.</p><p>Is there something weird about the WRT150N&#039;s TFTP flashing? Am I missing something? Has anyone got another way to reflash this thing to the factory default?</p><p>The only flash method that I can find that works is using mtd at the command line to pump in a new .trx file. Which is all well and good, but I don&#039;t have a .trx file for the default WRT150N firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve heard Kaloz mention on multiple occasions that TFTP on the WRT150N is broken. To obtain a trx from a Linksys bin, run the following command<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd bs=32 skip=1 if=linksys.bin of=linksys.trx</code></pre></div><p>This can then be flashed using mtd.</p>									</div>

					<p>You can get some live CD distribution like Knoppix or use xVM VirtualBox from Sun (a virtualization environment) and install a full and friendly Linux distribution such as Ubuntu</p><p>Or ask for someone to send you the resulting trx file (2814944 bytes) and then use WinSCP</p><p>If you don&#039;t understand what I am talking about... do not try it.</p>									</div>
