					<p>Hi,</p><p>New to Openwrt (but previous experience with Tomato and&nbsp; &#039;DD&#039; on a previous router), and I thank everyone for their contributions to this great firmware.</p><p>Just purchased WR841ND v7.2 and installed 12.09 as instructed by the Wiki.&nbsp; All seems fine.</p><p>I have one client pc (Win7 32 bit) with Edimax ew-7811un wifi adapter (latest drivers from realtek) that is having a problem maintaining wifi connection.&nbsp; Have owned this adapter for a long time, no previous issues at all with any other router (at least 3 of them).&nbsp; I am getting these error messages in the Openwrt log:</p><p>A bunch of these in a row-<br />OpenWrt daemon.notice hostapd: wlan0: STA 80:1f:02:xxxxx... IEEE 802.11: did not acknowledge authentication response</p><p>then-<br />Mar 17 15:08:46 OpenWrt daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 80:1f:02xxx IEEE 802.11: authenticated<br />Mar 17 15:08:46 OpenWrt daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 80:1f:02xxxf IEEE 802.11: associated (aid 1)<br />Mar 17 15:08:46 OpenWrt daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 80:1f:02xxx WPA: pairwise key handshake completed (RSN)</p><p>but then-<br />Mar 17 15:21:08 OpenWrt daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 80:1f:02xxx IEEE 802.11: disassociated<br />Mar 17 15:21:09 OpenWrt daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: STA 80:1f:02xxx IEEE 802.11: deauthenticated due to inactivity (timer DEAUTH/REMOVE)</p><p>and the pc obviously loses connectivity.&nbsp; After I fiddle with it manually, it will re-establish connection, only to eventually experience same problem again.</p><p>Any thoughts how to fix this?&nbsp; I have several other PC&#039;s with same Edimax adapter, no issues that I have discovered although they are not actively used as much as this pc, which is up 24x7x365.</p><p>I am using WPA2 personal for security, AES encryption, openwrt set to &quot;auto&quot;.<br />Thanks.</p>									</div>
