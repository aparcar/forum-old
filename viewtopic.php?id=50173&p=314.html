					<p>Hello,<br />I am not sure that I am posting in the right place, but this is about the WRT1900AC.&nbsp; I have a new unit (actually a refurbished from Linksys straigh from the box as purchased onthe store) and it is a V1 (the serial number starts with 13J10.</p><p>I flashed it with Chaos Calmer (openwrt-15.05-mvebu-armada-xp-linksys-mamba-squashfs-factory.img) and everything went fine.&nbsp; I logged into it and the first thing I want to do is to create a small netwrok on the LAN side (192.168.3.0/24).&nbsp; So I set the unit to 192.168.3.1 with the proper mask (255.255.255.0).&nbsp; On the WAN side, I set it to obtain a DHCP address from my intranet (192.168.1.0/24).&nbsp; I apply the change and everything works OK: the WAN got an IP address (192.168.1.119) with a gateway at 192.168.1.254 and a DNS at 192.168.1.4 (these are the normal setting of all the computer at home).&nbsp; A laptop conencted by wire to the LAN side got a IP of 192.168.3.174: all is fine!</p><p>I can HTTP to the WAN fine, and I can HTTP to the LAN fine also.</p><p>Now problems starts: from the laptop, I cannot access the web or by network: I cannot get out of the 192.168.3.0/24 network.&nbsp; If I try to get to google on the laptop, it doesn ot work.&nbsp; But, if I go to Network/Diagnostic, I can ping dev.openwrt.org fine, a traceroute and a snlookup works also fine!</p><p>Obviously, there is something that does not work with the gateway portion of my OpenWRT settings.&nbsp; I played a lot with it, and I am sure that it is more or less the way it was after the flash and the settings described above.&nbsp; I assume that by default OpenWRT is setup as a gateway, as long os the WAN can connect properly and the LAN is on a different network.&nbsp; Am I right here.</p><p>I realized also when playing around that the Network/Wireless is not there: there is no way to setup the wireless.&nbsp; This is very odd!</p><p>Now, as I palyed a little bit with it, I decided to put it back to default: thre is not &quot;Perform reset&quot; on the System/Backup/Flas Firmaware page.&nbsp; I cannot put it back to the default of OpenWRT!</p><p>So I decided to refalsh it with the sysupgrade file (openwrt-15.05-mvebu-armada-xp-linksys-mamba-squashfs-sysupgrade.tar).&nbsp; It applies the update, it flashes (I assume), then nothing!&nbsp; My laptop looses connection and cannot get an IP back!&nbsp; (I have not tried on the WAN side).&nbsp; I then assumed that it is bricked (OMG).&nbsp; Then I tried the Backup Firmware Recovery descibed on the page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac:">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac:</a> I did not follow exactly the process but eventually the router power LED is solid: I plug my laptop in the LAN side, and zoom I get the address 192.168.3.174 and I am back at where I was before updating the firmware: I have OpenWRT with my settup descibed above (192.168.3.1 on the LAN and 192.168.1.119 on the WAN.</p><p>So, as I am bold, I decided to put back the linksys firmware: I flas with the file FW_WRT1900AC_1.1.10.167514_prod.img.</p><p>BTW: on both time I flashed, I uncheck the Keep settings!</p><p>After the flash with the Linksys firmware, nothing is happenning: my laptop cannot get an IP!&nbsp; I am back at a bricked router (OMG again)!</p><p>I then do the process to do the Backup Firmware Recovery: this time I do it to the letter!&nbsp; I am back at OpenWRT with the same settings:&nbsp; I have OpenWRT with my settup descibed above (192.168.3.1 on the LAN and 192.168.1.119 on the WAN.</p><p>Now, can someby shed some light here: I am stuck at OpenWRT with some settings that I made, and I do not find any way to go back to a fresh OpenWRT installation: I cannot falsh with the sysupgrade file, I cannot tell the router to go to the default settings, ad I cannot flash back the Linksys firmware.&nbsp; Also, the gateway does not work properly and I do not have any access to the wireless!</p>									</div>

Since I have almost the same settings on OPENWRT and the original firmware, i did only notice this today when I accessed 192.168.1.1 and saw the blueish linksys UI. <br />Is there anything i missed when I was setting up OPENWRT?
