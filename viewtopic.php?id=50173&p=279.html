I have posted a script that when the router boots will automatically put 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz wifi on different CPU&#039;s as well as WAN port and the 4 eithernet ports. It&#039;s been documented that out of the box install of OpenWrt, only uses 1 cpu core for both wifi channels as well as WAN and Ethernet ports. With default configuration, CPU Core 0 becomes 100% utilized very quickly, so if you balance the load between 2 cpu&#039;s, it helps performance, buy my estimation 10%-20%.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 14 Aug 2015, 20:57)</p>

					<p>I am not sure how many WRT1900AC v1 users are still waiting for dd-wrt but Kong posted his build on his PTB page a couple of days ago.</p><p><a href="http://www.desipro.de/ddwrt/WRT1900ACV1/">http://www.desipro.de/ddwrt/WRT1900ACV1/</a></p><p>So I guess its open season for the WRT1900AC v1. <br />At least until BS gets it fully integrated into his main release betas.</p>									</div>
