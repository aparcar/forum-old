					<p>I have a co-worker that used to work for NASA at the machine level, specifically with VAX VMS. I was explaining how we are getting the CPU Stall crashes, and he said it sounds like a spin-lock, and recommends upping the spinlock time-outs. Essentially, he said, there&#039;s a process that isn&#039;t sending a interrupt back in a timely matter (Diver/kernel issue). </p><p>He also recommended putting Wifi 2.4 and 5Ghz on CPU1 and Ethernet1 and 0 on CPU0 (Affinity), and that may help to alleviate some of the problem (not all).</p><p>I&#039;m trying to talk him into purchasing the 1900ac and get involved.. the reason being is this guy has 30+ years experience with Linux at the hardware layer, and would be a huge help sorting out issues.

He said, by the time we are getting the spin-locks, everything has already gone south, and probably isn&#039;t recoverable.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 15 Jul 2015, 16:58)</p>
