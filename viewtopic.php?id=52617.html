					<p>I have recently acquired the same router, lol. So do you want to go back to stock or want to flash OpenWRT? In any case, it is really very simple. Just go to your &quot;Upgrade Firmware&quot; page of the router, select the firmware, and accept (click OK/Update/Upload).</p><p>Which is the right firmware? Well, the stock firmware you can get from TP-Link&#039;s own site. OpenWRT firmware you can get from <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600</a> , as you know I&#039;m sure. Or if you don&#039;t, click either link (depending on which version you want. Barrier Breaker is newer) on the first line below the first table on the page.</p><p>How to set OpenWRT up? That depends on what you want, so a dummy guide you need to find yourself. It can be real simple, it can be amazingly complicated...&nbsp; Or post whatever things you need help with here.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Djalaal</strong> on 7 Sep 2014, 14:43)</p>

					<p>That was info you should really have mentioned the first time, lol. Well, how come there is no GUI? Did the image not come with one? Because then you might have gotten the wrong image, cause mine came with one (Barrier Breaker). You can do 2 things:</p><p>Upgrade OpenWRT with a new image (only when you&#039;ve already got it on your router!), use sysupgrade as described here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a> .</p><p>If you don&#039;t wanna do that, why don&#039;t you just install the GUI? Type &quot;opkg install lucy&quot; as described here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a> .</p><p>Btw, if you have put a password on your router since flashing new firmware, you can&#039;t use telnet. Use something like putty instead.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Djalaal</strong> on 7 Sep 2014, 15:15)</p>

					<p>maybe try flashing an openwrt build with Luci GUI, such as 14.07-rc3. No need to strip anything and then you can actually try openwrt. If you don&#039;t like it, you&#039;ll at least be at a point that will be easier to follow the wiki.</p>									</div>

					<p>Trucker, nothing changed about my answer. You only accessed telnet, though that is all you need to solve your problem. Did you try &quot;sysupgrade&quot; or &quot;opkg install lucy&quot; commands like I said earlier?</p><p>I see you got attitude adjustment. I don&#039;t know whether it is normal that it doesn&#039;t come with GUI, as I&#039;ve never tried it. I installed barrier breaker from the beginning and that one definitely has a GUI included. So the choice is up to you. Upgrade or install lucy (GUI).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Djalaal</strong> on 7 Sep 2014, 20:35)</p>

					<p>Finally got it last night. Wget would always time out and hours later I realised the ip of my laptop ended with 12 and not 2 as I thought I set it. <br />I flashed one of the community builds first and then the stock one after that.</p>									</div>
