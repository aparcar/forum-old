					<p>I had kamikaze running just fine,&nbsp; so i decided to upgrade to my customized backfire.</p><p>I did mtd -r write image linux , the process went smooth but the router did not start.<br />The power led keeps blinking forever. So i tried to reflash via tftp backfire from openwrt site ,<br />but apparently even after a tftp the router just keeps blinking the power led.</p><p>Any ideas ?</p>									</div>
