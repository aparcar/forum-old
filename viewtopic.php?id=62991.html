					<p>I had my laptop dns set to use OpenDns servers but left the router as default..It was working fine until my ISP gave me a new Dlink router...Now It is redirecting my laptop from using the opendns server address I put on my laptop...I cannot figure out how to get my router to stop blocking my laptop wireless network settings..Will using the Open WRT firmware help me with this problem? Thank you</p>									</div>

					<p>I just looked at the invoice and realized that it is really a Dlink DSL 6850u which according to the link on this site is manufactered directly by the ISP and a lot of options are blocked. That being said can I put openwrt on it and then have better control? Can I override their Features blocking..?</p>									</div>

					<p>Check whether you can upload openWRT and if not, get rid of it in favour of one which is compatible.<br />by and large, it makes sense not to use ISP-supplied routers. The economics of the ISP business are such that they have to cut every conceivable corner in the manufacture</p>									</div>

					<p>If it&#039;s a DSL modem and the router combo, afaik you will lose the DSL modem functionality if you flash OpenWrt.</p><p>If your ISP-supplied router is intercepting DNS requests on port 53, you may check if OpenDNS supports other ports (like 5353) and if you can set laptop to use the non-standard DNS port.</p><p>Overall tho, wayne1958 is right, if you want to be in control it&#039;s better not to use the ISP-supplied combos. See if you can buy a standalone DSL modem which you can put in a bridge mode and use your own (ideally OpenWrt-compatible) router with.</p>									</div>

					<p>Any thing given to you by ISP need to be supported by them, not D-Link. The Modem may belong to them. ISPs handle there own FW when it comes to this situation.</p><p>One suggestion would be to bridge the ISP modem and install a external DIR series router for better handling. You can install OpenWRT if you need to however OEM FW should work as well.</p><p>There was response to your post there...there wasn&#039;t any from you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FurryNutz</strong> on 1 Mar 2016, 17:32)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the replies..It seems like the best option would be to switch the combo to bridge mode and buy another router...Fuzzy what did you mean by trying another port on the laptop..How do I do it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Ya I would bridge the ISP modem and get a DIR series router that has comparable WiFi that you need. If you don&#039;t need any AC wireless then find something that will work with N for you. I can recommend some models if needed.</p><p>I believe you may have been referencing a different user regarding trying another port? </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>dovber26 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Thank you for the replies..It seems like the best option would be to switch the combo to bridge mode and buy another router...Fuzzy what did you mean by trying another port on the laptop..How do I do it?</p></blockquote></div>									</div>

					<p>My local store is limited here by me . They have two TPlink N models TLWR841N and TLWA830RE ..Do you think they will be sufficient?
