Using uboot and your TFTP server, reprogram the &quot;u-boot&quot; partition with &quot;Bootloader.bin&quot;<br />4. Reboot into the original factory uboot and using that program the &quot;ALL&quot; partition with &quot;ALL.bin&quot;.<br />5. Reboot - you are done</p><p>BTW, it can also be done from the ash command line but it&#039;s a bit more complicated. In short you&#039;d need to do this:</p><p>1. Shutdown the squashFS and run out of a ramdisk<br />2. Using mtd write &quot;Bootloader.bin&quot; to the u-boot MTD partition<br />3. Concantenate Kernel_RootFS.bin + params.bin + user_backup.bin + user.bin + Rootfs.bin into one file using cat<br />4. Useing mtd write that file to the firmware MTD partition<br />5. Reboot</p><p>Ideally, someone could write a short script to do the above but my time is tight and I don&#039;t have time to write it or test it at the moment. I strongly recommend that if one just wants to experiment with OpenWRT that they use a platform that can easily be switched back and forth like RPi or beagle black (I prefer the latter).</p><p>Hope this helps</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wingspinner</strong> on 1 Nov 2014, 00:58)</p>

					<p>Hootoojunkie-</p><p>Yes, usb webcam works great iIt you load all the right modules and packages. You need V4L stuff and the webcam streamer package. As far as the other issue you describe Its hard to say but it sounds like you ventured into the unknown and clobbered the bootloader. Yes you can flash the &quot;factory&quot; image using the boot loader or mtd_write if you flash it to the &quot;firmware&quot; partition. It&#039;s only 3.5mb because it&#039;s not the entire flash - just the firmware partition. If you&#039;ve overwritten the boot loader the only way to fix that is to remove the flash chip and put the&nbsp; bootloader back in with an external programmer. Led&#039;s staying on for a few seconds indicated the bootloader may still be there. In that cas you must hook up a serial console and use the bootloader to load the factory image into the correct partition. Programming the flash on any of these devices is an area on should tread carefully and only proceed if you are sure you have everything write because the consequences are difficult as you may have found.</p>									</div>

					<p>HooTooJunkie,</p><p>Everything you need is in this thread, on my github site or in the OpenWrT wiki. Hence the thread name &quot;Files and install instructions for HooToo HT-TM02 (RT5350)&quot;. The bootloader is the standard uboot and there are lots of instructions in the Wiki (some related to other devices) but it&#039;s self explanatory. Use Google. If you check the first two posts of this thread carefully it refers you to my github site for photos showing where the serial port connections are and also tells you they are marked on the board. </p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>

The adapters sold for the Beagle board or&nbsp; RaspberryPi work fine although I prefer the adapters that use the FTDI chip because the drivers aren&#039;t so fussy as the others. Here are some sources: <a href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_Accessories#Serial_Debug_Cables.">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBon … ug_Cables.</a></p><p>In my experience, if one is planning on doing anything more than a one-time installation you&#039;ll eventually need to use the serial console port to recover a board so it&#039;s a good idea to have both a 5v and a 3v compatible adapter on hand. It also makes it a lot easier to setup a new install since you can configure the OS even if your network interface isn&#039;t up yet. </p><p>If you use a &quot;UVC&quot; compatible camera (they usually will be specified as compatible with Linux) you&#039;ll need to install the following packages:</p><p>- fswebcam<br />- kmod-video-core<br />- kmod-video-videobuf2</p><p>I&#039;ve also had a USB camera working with mjpg-streamer package but fswebcam worked with no configuration whatsoever - just installed it and it worked.</p><p>If you really want to have fun I suggest you setup the OpenWRT buildroot then you can configure the firmware any way you want without having to load packages at run-time. That&#039;s were the fun really begins in my opinion!</p><p>Have fun!</p>									</div>

					<p>HooTooJunkie,</p><p>RT5350 is hardware and will support pretty much everything if you have a bootload and OS software to do it. RT5350 is hardware - needs software to do anything. I don&#039;t believe that the standard uboot (either the original HooToo supplied or the bare-bones version I got from the RT5350 developers kit) has usb boot support built in. In fact, I&#039;m pretty sure they don&#039;t. You&#039;d have to build a uboot with that compiled in.</p><p>Anyway, if you clobber uboot on the built-in flash you won&#039;t be doing any of those things anyway. However, with your description of the LED behavior I believe your install may be working just fine but you haven&#039;t configure the networking yet and, as a result, you can&#039;t talk to it.</p><p>Also, the &quot;driver&quot; I&#039;m talking about is for the PC/Linux machine. Anyway, good luck with your experiments.</p><p>Cheers!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, @wingspinner, for the great work! I love the pain-free install process via the factory image. Sweet!</p><br /><p>I just ran into a little snag during the configuration (I&#039;ve been using LuCI, but I do know my way around the shell a bit as well):</p><p>- I set the green LED to show LAN activity, set the IP address of the LAN interface to static and turned off DHCP for the interface. Reboot. Everything still works great and the device is reachable via the new IP as expected.</p><p>- I disabled the WiFi interface and unchecked &quot;bring up interface on boot&quot; for it. Reboot. And the device doesn&#039;t answer on the static IP on the LAN interface any more!?!?</p><br /><p>Symptoms:</p><p>- Both LEDs come on and turn off during the initial boot as usual.</p><p>- The blue WiFi LED stays off (as expected).</p><p>- The green LAN LED comes on and even blinks a bit (probably other traffic on the network), which looks to me like the device is still booting to the point where it brings up the LAN fully.</p><br /><p>Is there some step in the boot process after the LAN interface is turned on that fails if the WiFi interface is missing? I noticed a br-0 interface in the configuration, but didn&#039;t look at it any closer. Is this bridge trying to span the WiFi as well and then fails to initialize (and thus set the IP) if WiFi is unavailable? Is there a chance that the LAN interface is brought up in some default configuration instead that I might be able to use to fix things? Or will I have to crack the device open and hook into the serial interface?</p><br /><p>@wingspinner, how difficult would it be to get the failsafe mode working in your patch? Is this something I could help with if you give me some quick pointers (I have quite a bit of coding experience, albeit not too much embedded stuff) or would it be more involved? I (and probably others, too) would feel a lot safer playing around with the configuration if I could always just do a &quot;factory reset&quot; (firstboot) easily if something gets screwed up.</p><p>Thanks again for all your work! Most appreciated!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Markus</strong> on 26 Dec 2014, 11:29)</p>

					<p>Thanks to wingspinner for all the good work!<br />I built a new image from the trunk, and it actually has failsafe mode. You can enter failsafe mode via the serial console when prompted, or just pressing the reset key after the prompt.</p><p>Mine has been acting flaky. I loaded my own image into it, and the next day, my image got erased, and it was just stuck in the u-boot menu. However, I was able to use tftp to load a new image via u-boot. Actually, I also found that with wingspinner&#039;s u-boot, if you press the reset button while powering it up, it automatically boots up with IP 10.10.10.123, and expects a tftp server at 10.10.10.3. If you put a file named Kernal.bin into your tftp server, it will flash it in for you. That&#039;s how I upgraded the firmware without even logging in.</p><p>But now, I have a different problem. When I edit the files in /etc/config with the firmware image that I compiled myself from the trunk, my files all get lost every time I reboot. It&#039;s as if it runs firstboot every time you reboot. Is anyone else seeing this problem,and how to I fix it?</p>									</div>
