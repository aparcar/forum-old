					<p>Hi,</p><p>I should have done more research before I decide to flash my FW. Anyway, I did and I need your help.</p><p>How do I reset the openwrt installed on my TP WR841N to original openwrt factory system. I think I tried my reset button in the back, but it never worked. I can&#039;t log in into the web control panel anymore because I messed up with some settings. </p><p>So how do I reset or get any chance to make it back to openwrt default setting. I only have a CAT5. I don&#039;t know why I couldnt get access to web control panel to undo my setting. Is there other way to reset my router?</p><p>Please help.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think what I did wrong in the begining. I somehow stupidly decided to change the router from static IP to DCHP .. so I think the router no longer have 192.168.1.1 as default. Is that right? When I see the openwrt from my first router, the ip address is 192.168.1.76 with DHCP .. Do I need to change anything first? Or do I use 192.168.1.76 instead of 192.168.1.1?</p><p>To set computer ip address, Do I go to adapter property, in ipv4, and change to that ip and subnet right?</p>									</div>

					<p>No that is what failsafe is for<br />it always uses 192.168.1.1</p><p>if led starts blinking rapidly you&#039;re in failsafe and ip is temporary back at 192.168.1.1</p>									</div>
