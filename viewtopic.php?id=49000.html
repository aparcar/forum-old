					<p>Hi there,<br />I&#039;m using openwrt (12.09 final) and just installed a Ubuntu 13.10 desktop on my PC.<br />I&#039;m having this strange behavior that I try to access (on chrome and on firefox) my router through its name (something like &quot;router.mynetwork.local&quot;) and it won&#039;t open, but if I try to access it through its IP it works.<br />I&#039;ve tried to ping router.mynetwork.local and it does not ping(when I ping the IP address, its ok), i&#039;ve tried to resolve the name, and it does resolve it normally.</p><p>Oh, In my Windows, my iPad and my Android it&#039;s ok, this behavior is only happening on Ubuntu ... <br />It&#039;s /etc/resolv.conf contains &quot;nameserver 127.0.0.1&quot; and &quot;search mynetwork.local&quot;</p><p>Any clues?</p>									</div>
