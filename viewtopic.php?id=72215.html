					<p>Is it possibile to install openvpn in a router with only 4mb flash without extroot? I have a mr3420 v3 and i have to use the usb 3/4 g module. I&#039;ve read the tutorial about installing extroot in the sdcard of 3g dongle but my usb dongle can&#039;t do the prerequisites configuration. I&#039;m trying to remove some packages from the .bin file but i don&#039;t know wich packages i can delete. I&#039;ve tried another solution, install openvpn directly on ram but i failed because i can&#039;t install kmod-tun zlib liblzo. I&#039;ve found them this work-around in this link: <br />just google openvpn ram 4mb, the first link<br />Someone have a solution or is it impossible?</p>									</div>

Wich packages i can delete except luci? For openvpn working i need almost 149kb of free space, i need to install only 2 files, openvpn-openssl and luci-app-openvpn. <br />This is my software list at the moment: pastebin . com/PyAC1sCs<br />Package for usb and 3/4G are indispensable</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Kalamaius</strong> on 3 Oct 2017, 18:35)</p>

					<p>If you&#039;re going to use with one specific modem, delete the drivers that it doesn&#039;t use.&nbsp; Most 4G modems present themselves as an Ethernet device with an IP address, they don&#039;t &quot;dial up&quot; like 3G modems with chat and ppp.&nbsp; The ppp related stuff is rather large.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 3 Oct 2017, 19:05)</p>
