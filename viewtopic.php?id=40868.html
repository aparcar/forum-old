					<p>It all depends on your goal: if you just want to have quickly a camera streaming setup, this would be the easiest solution.</p><p>But if you actually want to learn how to do it the hard way, then buying the original and making it yourself is far more rewarding.</p><p>As for where to find information, the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">Wiki</a> is generally a good place to start, then you have to skim the forums, where people already discussed how to set up a camera for streaming.</p><p>Regarding the custom web-pages, the entry point much depends on your previous knowledge: if you already know about web&nbsp; technique (HTML, Javascript), then it is pretty straightforward for simple pages.</p><p>For more sophisticated pages involving partial refresh and interactivity and if you know nothing about it yet, try learning about Ajax and study the contents of HTTP headers.</p><p>Now, if you want to provide router-side dynamically generated contents, you will have to learn CGI and the language used to generate the dynamic pages on the router:.</p><p>If you are using LuCI, then this is Lua, and a good start point is on the corresponding <a href="http://www.lua.org">http://www.lua.org</a> web site, where you will find a lot of tutorials.</p><p>For LuCI itself, it will be interesting to look at the materials provided at <a href="http://luci.subsignal.org/trac,">http://luci.subsignal.org/trac,</a> and to study the existing LuCI code itself.</p>									</div>

					<p>Wire_Free,<br />I have got one from Hong Kong and 3 from China (all with original Chinese firmware). It can take a while (3 weeks to UK), but the price is right.<br />Go with original firmware, as flashing from that is well documented and easy.</p>									</div>

					<p>As Rob said, it can take a while to get one from China/HK, but you can&#039;t find them anywhere else, as the TL-WR703N is for the Chinese market only (NOT RoHS/CE/FCC compliant).</p><p>This is not the case of the (non-working with OpenWrt because of the small memory capacities) TL-WR702N, and the slightly larger and 2x more expensive TL-MR3020 (supported by OpenWrt).</p><p>Make sure when you flash it to use the &quot;squashfs-factory&quot; image, NOT the &quot;jffs2-factory&quot; of &quot;*-sysupgrade&quot;: this way, you always have a &quot;failsafe&quot; available in case you screw up your network config, as long as you don&#039;t install images from some unknown website.</p>									</div>
