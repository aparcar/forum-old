It also could be a inexpensive way of getting into embedded Linux world, such as learning Linux firmware programming, writing Linux device driver.&nbsp; WRT160NL got a larger flash ROM, so supposedly it would fit bigger program, but unfortunately it is so new, a lot of driver seems to be still work in progress.</p>									</div>

Like any other open source project, it take a lot of trial and error and figuring out. Kamikaze of Openwrt is but one OS out of many (among others, DD-wrt, Tomato, etc). And since it&#039;s not commercialized (meaning no deadline), it&#039;s constantly changing all the time. </p><p>I&#039;m afraid the best way is to ask questions and do a lot of reading yourself.

I&#039;ve never used ca-42 cable, but it seems troublesome from the posts. I am using FTDI cable on two different routers without problem, but you need to built different adaptor boards because the manufacturers sometime switch pins around.

					<p>I have read that openwrt will not support client bridge mode like dd-wrt right out of the box (given the hardware doesn&#039;t do the magic with the MAC addressing), but I have to ask if this is still possible.</p><p>I see that openwrt has fire wall rules and vlan support and basically a fully functional linux kernel.</p><p>Isn&#039;t it possible to create some IP table rules which will allow the wireless to be the WAN side of the firewall and all of the other ports or even just the original WAN port (eth1) to be a port behind a NAT firewall?</p><p>I read that the wireless is just one of the ports on the switch along with eth0, so maybe to fully do this it requires vlan support. If this is the case what is holding up the switch configuration, is this something that can be patched or hard coded into working?</p><p>Even if the vlan support is necessary to make this work across all the switch ports, I would be happy with it working on one port and my understanding is that the WAN port is tied to the processor as eth1 directly. Can someone help me setup my rules to make this work using wlan0 and eth1?</p>									</div>

					<p>What is type of your battery ? <br />I&nbsp; have measure voltage of linksys adapter - 15.4V !&nbsp; &nbsp;, so i think PB batt will have no problem (with 14.4V at full state) - and my opinion - this will be better , because battery not generating noise on powerline</p>									</div>

					<p>What linksys adapter? For a long time linksys was providing unregulated power supplys, but the one that comes with wrt160nl is a pretty eficient regulated 12v power supply. So I don&#039;t think you will have it outside of 11.9-12.1 range...</p>									</div>

					<p>Yea ,right ..my fault<br />But I replaced this switching adapter with old one with convertor because of serial console was messed up with noise generated by that switching adapter.
