					<p>Hi, all!</p><p>With the help of this great forum and the OpenWrt wikis I was able to set up my router (TL-WR741ND v. 4.21) as a repeater bridge with the <em>relayd</em> package. The main modem/router is on the lower level of my house and the OpenWrt router is on the second floor. This last router functions as a repeater bridge both wirelessly (for phones and tablets) and to a LAN port on the computer I&#039;m using right now.</p><p>I&#039;ve used this setup with Linux Mint with absolutely no problems. Internet connection is stable both wirelessly and throught the LAN port.</p><p>However, I just installed Windows 7 on this computer (dual-boot with Linux Mint) and I can&#039;t get an internet connection when I&#039;m using Windows. But I discovered something even weirder. When using Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Starcraft II, all these applications say that there is no internet connection. The weird thing is, I installed some nvidia drivers and that application DID manage to connect to the internet and install some .NET framework files as well as other driver-related files.</p><p>Here are the relevant /etc/config/* files:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    ===================================================================

Just pointing DHCP and DNS server to main router.<br />If you don&#039;t know how to do it, reset your repeater DHCP settings.

Fresh install, if possible.<br />No need to disable Windows firewall to access wireless network. Ask Microsoft for it.</p>									</div>

					<p>The weirdest thing happened last night... Just as I was about to try disabling DHCP and DNS, I booted Windows and I had the fastest internet connection I&#039;ve ever had. I was able to install all ~14GB of Starcraft II. But then, dissappointment returned because after installing the game I lost the internet connection and I haven&#039;t been able to get it back.</p><p>I didn&#039;t change anything prior to getting a connection. I have rebooted (and shut down - turn on) several times to no avail. I also tried disabling DHCP and DNS and it didn&#039;t work.</p><p>Even if you guys can&#039;t help me I would love to know not <em>how</em> but <em>why</em> this thing works 100% of the time on Linux and only 1 time on Windows. It doesn&#039;t make sense, does it?</p><p>EDIT: I hadn&#039;t mentioned this previously but I <strong>am</strong> able to see the both the OpenWrt router and the modem settings webpages on my browser (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.254, respectively).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ProblemsWithWindows</strong> on 13 Jul 2013, 20:43)</p>
