					<p>umount the drive first, then unplug the cable, and plug it back in.&nbsp; It should automatically mount with the permissions you defined in the hotplug script.</p>									</div>

					<p>no, the hotplug script creates the directory for the drive but it doesn&#039;t mount it.<br />Is there a possibility to redirect the output of mount to a file?</p><p>EDIT:<br />I found the problem only a slip of the pen, there was a space missing between the arguments</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>scales</strong> on 20 Sep 2006, 18:05)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the posting, I was going to try to modify the code in /etc/hotplug.d/usb/01-mount, but I had to do the research on mount first.&nbsp; The above works great.&nbsp; For the record the correct code is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> mount -o auto,users,umask=000,dmask=000,fmask=000,uid=65534,gid=65534 ${part} ${path}</code></pre></div><p>and should replace</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> mount ${part} ${path}</code></pre></div><p>I was able to connect easily from an XP client (I have changed by defualt so XP does not use the user acount &quot;Guest&quot; exclusively&quot;) but only by typing // and the ip address in file explorer, I could not browse.&nbsp; Once connected I was easily able to transfer large quantities of files in the 500 KB to 1 MB range but I could not transfer files in the 250 MB range.</p><p>I use the samba client to as a backup mechanism to a usb hard drive, I would like it better if some password was used to minimize damage to the back up from other people on the network.&nbsp; I believe that I can accomplish this by modifing the smb.conf file, but it will have to wait untill I have researced it.&nbsp; In the mean time,&nbsp; thanks to the above, I have minimal functionality.</p><p>my /etc/smb.conf/ is:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[global]
 syslog = 0
 syslog only = yes
 workgroup = mshome
 server string = OpenWrt Samba Server
 security = share
