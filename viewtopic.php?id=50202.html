					<p>Hi,<br />How can I run a script every time my internet facing public ip address changes (this happens 2-4 times a day with my ISP)?<br />Is there a way to subscribe to this event?</p><p>(If it matters, in this script I need only to make a single HTTP get request)</p>									</div>

					<p>You could add a cron entry with a script that check every tot minutes if the wan ip is not the same, with a simple if condition to execute an external script.<br />Hope it helps.<br />Regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kalauz</strong> on 20 Apr 2014, 13:33)</p>

					<p>Yeah I have thought about that... But I was hoping there is a better way. I am not an expert on this but I think Tomato had an event like WAN UP or something that allowed me to hook into and run a script. Doesn&#039;t OpenWRT have something similar?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>itaysk</strong> on 20 Apr 2014, 13:42)</p>

However I can&#039;t get the expected behaviour.</p><p>(1) For debugging, I have added 2 hotplug scripts under iface and net.<br />Both just log the hotplug parameters (action, interface,device)<br />After boot, I see this in the log:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>(from net) add lo
(from iface) ifup loopback lo
(from net) add eth0
(from net) add eth1
(from net) add br-lan
(from iface) ifup lan br-lan</code></pre></div><p>so far it&#039;s OK.<br />now I try to ifconfig eth0 down and then up, but the log remains the same.<br />What am I missing?</p><p>(2) Regarding udhcpc - I didn&#039;t find the udhcpc.user file in my openWRT. Is it there by default?<br />(3) If it were there, are you sure it would have helped me? I understand this is the dhcp server for the router, so when a computer in the network gets a new ip maybe it would have triggered an event. but i am interested in the ip change of the wan interface of the router, not a device on the network.</p><p>(4) As far as your suggestion to search for an existing solution - I haven&#039;t found any references. <br />The closest thing I have found is the ddns.scripts package. From reading the source, I understand they are scanning for ip change every 10 minutes. I don&#039;t understand why they chose this implementation instead of responding to an event.</p><p>Thanks again for helping!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>itaysk</strong> on 24 Apr 2014, 19:57)</p>
