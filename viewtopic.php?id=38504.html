					<p>hello friends:</p><p>i have a tp-link mr3020 running on the stock company firmware and I&#039;m happy with it.</p><p>however I want to add openssh server to it, do u think it&#039;d be possible to add openssh to the stock firmware. I can see that there are tools that can extract / prepare tp-link firmware images.<br />the original firmware is linux only, so do u think it&#039;s possible to modify it and add openssh to it or add more drivers.</p><p>my point is that openwrt firmware has issues with enabling both wifi and few 3g dongles which work fine with the stock firmware. stock firmware is solid with a very capable web based management interface. now only if we could add more to it.</p><p>I know adding drivers may not be easy for reasons of kernel symbols and addresses but what about an application software like openssh.</p><p>What do u think, is it possible?</p><p>thanks.</p>									</div>
