					<p>I found a discussion about flashing openWRT files on/under/at Windows in 2012-04-15 (from buggers)<br />A heavy discussion without a answer.</p><p>So, I try again and use my router as a example.</p><p>I have a Netgear WNR2000V1.<br />I have read all the quotes and understand that I have to do the next steps using Linux:<br />- telnetenable<br />- open telnet<br />- download openWRT files with snarf<br />- flash de files with mtd<br />- reboot</p><p>Back to Windows.<br />I found at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr2000">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnr2000</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/telnet.console">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/telnet.console</a> how I can run telnetenable.exe under windows and can run a telnet session.<br />I also can download the openWRT files under windows using <a href="http://www.simcop2387.info/wnr2000">http://www.simcop2387.info/wnr2000</a> and <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx</a><br />But now the flashing step.<br />As far as I understand and have searched, there is no Windows mtd with equal functionality as Linux mtd.<br />Is this the right conclusion?</p><p>By the way, I have tried the flashing by doing all steps using a liveCD of Lubuntu (last version).<br />I ended with a bricked router, but luckely I could also unbrick it.<br />Doing the flash, I saw no error messages in each step, so I assume that everything step was OK.</p><p>And yes, I know very little of Linux, so, the only thing I can do, is typing each command line very precisely.<br />And I got the tip to use a liveCD, so a Linux install is not necessary. Is this OK?</p><p>So, 2 questions:<br />- flashing openWRT files will never been possible in a windows environment<br />- I can use a liveCD without installing Linux to do the flashing</p>									</div>

					<p>Exactly.&nbsp; When you telnet in and type for example &#039;mtd&#039; or &#039;snarf&#039;, the commands run on the router.&nbsp; Windows is operating simply as a keyboard and screen dumb terminal.</p><p>As a fellow owner of one, there is a big thread about the WNR2000v1 in this forum.&nbsp; It is a little tricky due to the small flash and unusual partitioning done by Netgear.&nbsp; I suggest you go right to the serial port (pins are already installed) rather than trying to enable the telnet on stock firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have done some research and practice, so indeed with telnet I am connected (login?) in a remote computer, the Netgear router.<br />So the next command cd /tmp is changing from directory in the router.<br />And with snarf I grab the files from a URL and write (put) them at the tmp directory.</p><p>And I have read the big thread about the WNR2000v1.<br />Some people are very happy that the flashing is succeeded and some people like me are disapointed to have a bricked router.<br />So, it seems that you have a change of 50/50 with the same router and doing the same instructions.</p>									</div>
