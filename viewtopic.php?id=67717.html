					<p>Hello, I am new to the forums and unfortunately fairly new to IPv6, but not new to OpenWRT. I&#039;ve been pottering around&nbsp; in these forums before as a registered user but finally I have a need to register.</p><p>My ISP (BT) has just rolled out IPv6, but they haven&#039;t got their own IPv6 DNS servers yet.</p><p>I&#039;ve put OpenDNS as my &quot;Announced DNS Servers&quot; and it mostly works, my Xbox One and one of my PCs gets them from DHCP, but this PC doesn&#039;t always seem to pick them up.</p><p>Any ideas what the issue could be? </p><p>It&#039;s a Windows 10 machine.</p>									</div>
