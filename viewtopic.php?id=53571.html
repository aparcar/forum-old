					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>I&#039;m having an issue with dnsmasq that I&#039;m hoping someone can help me with. I&#039;m a longtime user of OpenWRT and recently upgraded my TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1 to Barrier Breaker. At the same time, I decided to try out some DNS security tools, so I installed the dnsmasq-full package (so that I can begin using DNSSEC) and the dnscrypt-proxy package so I can communicate securely with an upstream DNS server. So, dnscrypt-proxy is listening on 127.0.0.1:2053, and /etc/config/dhcp is configured like so to make dnsmasq talk to dnscrypt-proxy:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config dnsmasq
    option domainneeded &#039;1&#039;
    option boguspriv &#039;1&#039;
    option localise_queries &#039;1&#039;
    option rebind_protection &#039;1&#039;
    option rebind_localhost &#039;1&#039;
    option expandhosts &#039;1&#039;
    option authoritative &#039;1&#039;
    option readethers &#039;1&#039;
    option leasefile &#039;/tmp/dhcp.leases&#039;
    option local &#039;/intra/&#039;
    option domain &#039;intra&#039;
    option noresolv &#039;1&#039;
    list server &#039;127.0.0.1#2053&#039;
    list server &#039;/pool.ntp.org/208.67.222.222&#039;
    option dnssec &#039;1&#039;
    option dnsseccheckunsigned &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>(I leaned on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dnscrypt">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/dnscrypt</a> to figure out my configuration.)</p><p>This works for a while, but three times now dnsmasq has become unresponsive:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# nslookup openwrt.org 127.0.0.1
Server:    127.0.0.1
Address 1: 127.0.0.1 localhost

nslookup: can&#039;t resolve &#039;openwrt.org&#039;: Name or service not known
root@OpenWrt:~#</code></pre></div><p>However, I can query my upstream DNS server via dnscrypt-proxy no problem:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# nslookup openwrt.org 127.0.0.1:2053
Server:    127.0.0.1
Address 1: 127.0.0.1 localhost

Name:      openwrt.org
Address 1: 78.24.191.177 openwrt.org
root@OpenWrt:~#</code></pre></div><p>...so dnscrypt-proxy and beyond seems to be working, it&#039;s just dnsmasq that&#039;s having trouble. Grepping logread for dnsmasq, I see DHCP back-and-forths until this line, and then nothing after it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Thu Oct 23 15:04:13 2014 daemon.warn dnsmasq[15886]: Maximum number of concurrent DNS queries reached (max: 150)</code></pre></div><p>This seems relevant, but it seems odd that hitting a concurrent query limit would cause dnsmasq to stop functioning from that point on.</p><p>Watching logread as I attempt queries against dnsmasq, there are no messages. If I try to stop dnsmasq via its init script or kill, it does not terminate. I have to kill -9 it, then I can start it via its init script and everything starts working again. Eventually (hours or days later) it fails again, though.</p><p>I assume there is further diagnosis I can do, any suggestions? I&#039;m happy to provide whatever information or take whatever steps would help, but I&#039;m not sure where to look next.</p><p>Thanks for your time in advance!</p>									</div>
