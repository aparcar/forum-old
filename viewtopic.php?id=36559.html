					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have an asus wl500gp v2.</p><p>From what I&#039;ve been reading, it should to possible to tether my iPad (verizon) a router with some form of openwrt installed.&nbsp; To my understanding the magic that makes it all happen is the ipheth kmod.&nbsp; I cannot find any release stable or svn that supports ipheth for the bcrm 2.4 series of openwrt.</p><p>I was wondering if any of you could supply this for me or know if it&#039;s possible to compile it myself.&nbsp; Any help would be most appreciated.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>The ipheth module was introduced in mainline 2.6.34. I would be quite surprised if anyone has ported the driver to such an old 2.4 kernel. Sad story indeed... the moral is that Broadcom sucks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, so I&#039;ll upgrade.</p><p>What does the forum think of either the linksys e4200 or asus rn-16 for longevity?&nbsp; Hopefully those will receive updates for the next couple of years.</p><p>Has anyone actually used ipheth with openwrt?&nbsp; To my understanding, it is a beta thing.</p><p>The other way I&#039;m considering is with an atom PC or netbook.&nbsp; I know this would be overkill, but it is pretty guaranteed to work between either linux or windows.</p><p>What do you guys (and hopefully some gals) think?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve used ipheth for iPhone 3G/3Gs/4 tethering in OpenWrt. Keep in mind that you also need the userspace software to actually pair and enable tethering. libimobiledevice, usbmuxd, and friends.</p><p>I would stay away from any broadcom-based routers. Anything Atheros AR7161 is screaming fast and extremely well supported in OpenWrt.</p>									</div>
