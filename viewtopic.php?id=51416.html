					<p>I am confused with the fact that the trunk version for this router does not offer wifi functionality but yet it it shows that the LAN and WAN ports are functional in the set up. Does this mean that I can gain internet connection via my wireless devices with the e3200 on OpenWRT or not ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t be confused.</p><p>LAN normally means the wired ethernet ports.<br />WAN means the wired &quot;Internet&quot; ethernet port.</p><p>No Wifi means you cannot use Internet with your wireless devices.<br />Internet with wired devices connected to LAN should work.</p><p>Your Hardware is Broadcom according to <a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Linksys_E3200">wikidevi</a>. Broadcom situation is complicated : many older devices work but newer hardware often does not because Broadcoms management or lawyers are not green lighting release of specifications (to write drivers from scratch or extend the existing free ones) or drivers (they release some drivers but often not for those inside routers).</p>									</div>
