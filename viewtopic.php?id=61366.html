					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>i have a TP-Link TL-WR1043D v1 and it was OpenWRT installed, which was running for about 2 months. So far everything worked fine and as it should.<br />Yesterday i have restarted my router, i pulled the plug and put i back in. After that i had no internet anymore. After analysing i saw, that the wan port didnt work anymore. I tried to delete it in the interface view and add it again, but no luck.</p><p>Today i installed the original firmware, but in there the wan port also didnt work. Because i have a TL-WR1043D v1 which begins with a 12, i have used this german firmware file. </p><p>Basically i have used this guide: <a href="http://goo.gl/CWNyYa">http://goo.gl/CWNyYa</a> but, of course, i didnt install ddwrt but openwrt.</p><p>Is my wan port now broker forever, or is there a way to re-enable this?</p><p>Help is much aapreciated! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>maybe its a cable/wire&nbsp; thing.. it should be ok since you reverted to OEM fw<br />read owrtwiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd</a><br />if the wan port is broke you can transform a lan port into a wan port</p><p>from luci&gt;network&gt;switch assign one port from lan to wan and disable real wan switch port<br />considering you already have the wan interface defined it should work ok</p><p>make sure you can enter failsafe or have a ttl usb serial adapter close by before messing network/switch settings</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 7 Dec 2015, 00:05)</p>

					<p>So far no luck, but perhaps i have done something wrong. I have reflashed to stock and back, just to be sure, to start from scratch. What i still do not understand, why a simple reboot could do this?! The device worked flawless, until i powered it off and on.</p><p>Just to be sure, i will write down, what i have done:</p><p>- OpenWRT was running, but WAN didnt work. I have flashed with &quot;TL-WR1043ND-V1-FW0.0.3-stripped.bin&quot; to get back to stock, which i have done under &quot;Flash new firmware image&quot;.<br />- Then i have the file &quot;wr1043nv1_de_3_9_17_up_boot(100331)&quot; under the TP-Link management interface, which is the german firmware.<br />- Flashed the file &quot;openwrt-15.05-v1-squashfs-factory&quot; (had to shorten the name).<br />- Under LuCi i habe flashed &quot;openwrt-15.05-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade&quot; with &quot;Backup/Restore&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;Restore backup&quot;</p><p>so far, so right?</p><p>- Right after that, i have this view under &quot;Interfaces&quot;: <a href="http://goo.gl/YrYMaf">http://goo.gl/YrYMaf</a><br />So i have 2 WAN interface, and both without a MAC address.<br />- After that i removed the WAN6, and gave the WAN Port a MAC address [LAN]+1, as you can see here: <a href="http://goo.gl/FtnO60">http://goo.gl/FtnO60</a><br />But the port doesnt come up, as you can see.<br />- I have activated a LAN port as WAN, and under &quot;VLAN&quot; it looks like this: <a href="http://goo.gl/oHI5gL">http://goo.gl/oHI5gL</a><br />Port 1 should be the LAN and Port 4 should work as WAN. Port 0 was the old WAN, and Port 2 and 3 have i deactivated for this test.</p><p>Do i have to configure something in a special way?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blindhai</strong> on 7 Dec 2015, 13:33)</p>

					<p>i presume your modem is dhcp enabled for lan interface and when you connect pc&nbsp; straight to modem it gets a dhcp address<br />i also presume router wan interface is set to dhcp so it can pull a dhcp ip from modem</p>									</div>
