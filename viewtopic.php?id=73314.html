Some are better than others, and others are an out-of-date muddled mess. For a reasonably complete / up-to-date guide to installing, configuring and troubleshooting OpenVPN clients &amp; servers on OpenWrt (including creating a simple PKI), could I suggest you consider starting with vpn.openvpn instead of this page. It is not that the other pages aren&#039;t worth reading; it is just that (IMHO) vpn.openvpn is a better place to start (it has been rewritten from scratch just a few weeks ago). Maybe you could improve it further rather than edit this page?</p></blockquote></div><p>Is this a OpenWRT/LEDE Project merge problem, or something else?</p><p>Where can I find into on <strong>current</strong> Docs, How-To, Configs, etc for VPN-ing?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Mark_in_Hollywood</strong> on 19 Feb 2018, 22:25)</p>
