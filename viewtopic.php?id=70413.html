					<p>I have been having an issue where nmap only resolves hostnames on some networks, and not others. I initially suspected a network&#039;s router was to blame, but apps like fing are able to resolve hostnames no problem, so I think there is something iffy about my Openwrt configs. Can anyone points me in the right direction as to what parameters are involved in resolving hostnames? </p><p>Initially, &quot;boguspriv&quot; was set to 1, and that caused hostname resolution to always fail, so changing it to 0 has gotten resolution to work on some networks. Any other options that look suspicious? </p><p>EDIT: Will adding &quot;option dns &quot;Gateway IP&quot; (192.168.0.1 for example) force Openwrt to use my main router as the DNS sever? Because the network&#039;s router shows hostnames in its DHCP list. I don&#039;t have access to a network where reverse lookup is NOT working, so it&#039;s a little difficult to test at the moment.&nbsp; </p><br /><p>Here is my /etc/config/dhcp:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>config dnsmasq &#039;setup&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option domainneeded &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option boguspriv &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option filterwin2k &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option localise_queries &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option rebind_protection &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option rebind_localhost &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option local &#039;/lan/&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option expandhosts &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option nonegcache &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option readethers &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option leasefile &#039;/tmp/dhcp.leases&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option resolvfile &#039;/tmp/resolv.conf.auto&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option authoritative &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dhcpleasemax &#039;40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option domain &#039;openrouter-net&#039;</p><p>config dhcp &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option leasetime &#039;120m&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option start &#039;200&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option limit &#039;40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dhcp_option &#039;1,255.255.255.0&nbsp; 3,10.130.1.1&nbsp; 6,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dhcpv6 &#039;disabled&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ra &#039;server&#039;</p><p>config dhcp &#039;apspot&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;apspot&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option leasetime &#039;120m&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option start &#039;200&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option limit &#039;40&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dynamicdhcp &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config dhcp &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config odhcpd &#039;odhcpd&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option maindhcp &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option leasefile &#039;/tmp/hosts/odhcpd&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option leasetrigger &#039;/usr/sbin/odhcpd-update&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>/tmp/resolv.conf.auto:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p># Interface apspot<br />nameserver 8.8.8.8<br /># Interface wan<br />nameserver 192.168.0.1<br />search local.tld</p></blockquote></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>supergeen</strong> on 30 Mar 2017, 20:13)</p>
