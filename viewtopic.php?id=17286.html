					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Does anyone know if it&#039;s possible to mix access point and client modes in the Broadcom driver with &quot;Virtual WLAN&quot;?</p><p>***</p><p>I have a WL-500gP with 7.09, and I was wondering if could simultaneously:</p><p>a) Connect to an existing wireless network, &quot;SSID A&quot;, using WPA-PSK.</p><p>b) Host its own separate wireless network, &quot;SSID B&quot;, and act as an access point.</p><p>With SSIDs A &amp; B running on the same channel.</p><p>... it seemed to me like the &quot;Virtual WLAN&quot; feature of the broadcom drivers might allow me to do this, but after messing around for a few hours I&#039;m not able to get it working.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Angus</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Gus929</strong> on 12 Oct 2008, 03:36)</p>

					<p>Doesn&#039;t look like anyone can really help me with this, and it pretty much looks like it&#039;s not possible.</p><p>I had an Asus WL-167G (ralink) usb wireless adapter sitting around, and this was surprisingly easy to set up w/ Kamikaze as a client.

					<p>Thanks heaps for the reply Belfry.</p><p>I was trying with WPA on both the client &amp; AP side, although I thought I tried first without encryption. Hmmm. I did have some troubles getting two copies of &#039;nas&#039; to run simultaneously, I thought I got it sorted but perhaps it was the problem all along.</p><p>I might have a go at fixing it, although the rt2570 was so easy to get up and running that I might just stick with dual radio - this way I can run the two networks on different channels so they don&#039;t interfere with each other.</p><p>Thanks again for the reply, though.</p>									</div>

					<p>Gus929,</p><p>I&#039;m interested in a howto.&nbsp; This is exactly what I&#039;m hoping to accomplish.&nbsp; Actually, my end goal is to run 802.11A on the AP side.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to drop a single device into an existing frequency-saturated network that connects to the 802.11G and acts as a router to its own 802.11A network.</p>									</div>

					<p>syn,</p><p>Turns out &quot;easy t o get working&quot; for rt2570 actually meant &quot;Easy to get working with no WPA. With WPA, it works for ~ 10 seconds, and then it drops out.&quot; Going to try compiling a recent 2.6 kernel &amp; module, when I get a chance.</p><p>If you don&#039;t need WPA, the howto is pretty straightforward, something like this:</p><p>1) Edit /etc/config/network to add a normal network definition (IP address, etc.) for interface rausb0.</p><p>As per <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration#head-88e683a5391af425e3a3b9f25e5bb862177a7883">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam … 62177a7883</a></p><br /><p>2)<br />ipkg install kmod-rt2570<br />insmod rt2570</p><p>3) Plug in usb device</p><p>4) Run &quot;ifconfig rausb0&quot; and ensure there&#039;s something there.</p><p>5) /etc/init.d/network restart</p><p>6) <br />ifconfig rausb0 down&nbsp; <br />ifconfig rausb0 up&nbsp; <br />iwconfig rausb0 mode managed&nbsp; <br />iwconfig rausb0 essid blah</p><p>... probably want to put (6) into an init script and run it on reboot.</p><p>Details for some steps for (6) that -should- work with WPA. I&#039;ve tried a lot of combinations of these, but the link won&#039;t stay up for &gt; 10 seconds.<br /><a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19528686-iwpriv-rt2570-scripting-and-pulling-my-hair-out">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r195286 … y-hair-out</a></p><p>... this was all written from memory, but it should get you started. :-).</p><p>- Angus</p>									</div>
