About the AP &quot;Guest only&quot;: If your openwrt router supports VLAN (some routers do not), you can easily create a VLAN, set one of the ports to UNTAGGED (and I think the cpu port to TAGGED). After doing that, you can go to the network interface you&#039;ve created for the guest lan, and configure it to bridge the vlan you&#039;ve just created (&quot;VLAN Interface: eth0.X&quot;, where X is the VLAN ID)... with the wireless interface already configured there. This way, anything you connect to that physical port, will be in the guest lan (computer, AP, other router, a switch...).<br/>I tried to configure one port with untagged and tagged, but I think my routers can&#039;t work with that.

					<p>I&#039;ve taken a different approach to this problem, because I never could get two different Wifi-and-Ether VLANs to work.</p><p>Rather than use VLANs to create the two networks, I&#039;ve used an Alias interface:<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig br-lan 192.168.1.1  # Guest net
ifconfig br-lan:55 192.168.55.1  # Private net</code></pre></div><p>DHCP on the Guest net uses the standard setup, handing out addresses to all who ask, but DHCP on the Private net is configured to only look up MAC addresses in /etc/ethers. This is done via a one-line addition to dnsmasq.conf, because /etc/config/dhcp can&#039;t handle &quot;interface alias&quot; as an option.<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Ensure our Private net is served from /etc/ethers, with one-week leases
dhcp-range=192.168.55.1,static,255.255.255.0,168h</code></pre></div><p>This is feasable because the list of Private-net hosts is fully-known, relatively small, and relatively static, so I don&#039;t have to spend a lot of time updating /etc/ethers.</p><p>With this setup, there is no need for dual SSIDs - any host connecting via Wifi gets checked in /etc/ethers, and is given a Private-net address where appropriate - the IP-alias traffic works on Wifi just as well as on Ethernet.&nbsp; This works for hubs, switches, and Access Points (APs) because they do not change the MAC address of traffic through them - Private-net hosts can use APs with no special configuration.&nbsp; It also works for routers, but they <strong>do</strong> change the MAC address, so all traffic from a given router must be on a single net, and a router in the Private net must be registered in /etc/ethers.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tested all of the above situations, and I&#039;m happy to report that they all work exactly as intended.</p>									</div>
