The time behavior is definitely different though. My previous install would always update promptly. I wonder if it&#039;s related to my port usage. This is a slave router, and I don&#039;t connect the WAN port. Does the ntpclient insist on sending on that one?

					<p>31754 is the first trunk build with the new network interface management module, netifd, which is the default since yesterday.

Backfire is mostly code from March 2010 (10.03) and although some packages have been updated, the bulk of the code dates to that period. I am using the trunk build myself and have been building Backfire only because it is still the official stable branch.</p><p>I have seen some words from developers about finalising Backfire 10.03.2 and then at some point declaring a new &quot;stable&quot; branch from the current Attitude Adjustment using kernel 3.3.x as the common base. There has been a effort to bump all target platforms to the new 3.3.x kernel series, and about 3/4 of the currently active platforms are already there. <a href="https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2012-April/014952.html">https://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2012-April/014952.html</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 27 May 2012, 12:11)</p>

					<p>The update/build frequency is directly related to the bugs corrected / changes done.<br/>e.g. 32005 fixed a rather bad data corruption bug introduced in 31931 causing <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11557">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11557</a> , so I wanted to remove all post-31931 revisions from the FTP server. So I built 32008 rather quickly.</p><p>Currently I am building 32016, as there have been nice changes on the Luci side, e.g. fixing that empty IP address in status page error: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11561">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11561</a> . Will make that revision available after testing it.</p><p>EDIT: 32016 shows the IP address properly on the status page ;-)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...and WNDR3800 version is now included.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 31 May 2012, 22:08)</p>
