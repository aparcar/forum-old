					<p>Hi</p><p>i installed the freifunk-software (maybe someone know it, its based on OpenWRT) on my TP-Link WR841N. From this i used the softwareupdate in this software to install &quot;the original&quot; OpenWRT Software. It was a trunk version. So he takes the software and says me that he started new.</p><p>Now he started new, but i cant get configurate it. I can ping it over 192.168.1.1 but when i will get acces over telnet 192.168.1.1 23 he cant connect. I already tried to take the router in Failsafe-mode and i think i get (the power led was blinking really fast), but i not get a connection over telnet.</p><p>The really &quot;funny&quot; thing is that i can turn on the wifi over a hardware button. When i turn it on and connceted the router to the internet, i get a normal, but open, wifi &quot;OpenWRT&quot; with internet connection.</p><p>So can i buy a new router or does someone has an idea?</p>									</div>

					<p>So i just managed it to reinstall the original Firmware with a nice introduction i found on internet (Tftp-Server).</p><p>I would use it for policy routing and VPN, but when I read your links it isnt possible with this router. So i bought a Asus Router, it seems to be more easier.</p><p>But I thank you all really much!</p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately WR841N has no USB port.<br />Routers with only 4 MB flash but an USB port, can have the &quot;disk space&quot; enlarged with an Pen-drive. I used it on my ASUS RTN56U and it works fantastic.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is not very complicated to put a 16 MB flash chip into these.&nbsp; That makes VPN possible but you still have to be careful with only 32M of RAM.</p>									</div>
