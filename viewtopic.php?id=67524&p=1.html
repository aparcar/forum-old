					<p>You would start from OEM by flashing factory, and only factory. Once running owrt/lede and wanting to upgrade, you would than flash sysupgrade.

					<p>Hi there mate I run Gargoyle on my c7 and it&#039;s grate. It has a nice interface that is built ontop of Openwrt. It is much better for noobs to get up and running as all the options are lade out in a simple way, this dus not meen that it is not powerful! I use my c7 and have about 18 wifi devices and to bridges in my house + 3 wired PCS. You can see more here:<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/index.php</a><br />Gargoyle has loads of cool plugins&nbsp; such as a grate addblocker, Email notifications for Gargoyle (with SSL support)<br />Services Manager for Gargoyle<br />logread for GargoyleDLNA Support for GargoyleOpenVPN Support for GargoylePing WatchdogPPTP Support for Gargoyle<br />Graphical WiFi scanning support for Gargoyle (Full)<br />Tor Anonymizer Support for Gargoyle<br />USB Printer Support for GargoyleWiFi scheduling for Gargoyle<br /> Then ontop of all that the QOS is grate!<br />I am a mod on the Forum so if you need any help i will try my best to help. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Gargoyle Defaults<br />IP Address:<br />192.168.1.1<br />Password:<br />password   (Web Interface &amp; SSH)<br />SSH User:<br />root<br />You can flash straight from the user interface the file you will need is gargoyle_1.9.1-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/downloads/images/ar71xx/gargoyle_1.9.1-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/download … actory.bin</a><br />Openwrt and Gargoyle are a tad slower than the OEM firmware that comes on the c7 but you will only noitce if your broad band is faster than about 120 meg. My wifi is nice and stable for me but i do not have any apple stuff and that is what i see people talking about wen it comes to wifi drops.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi there Gargoyle is more intuitive with less setting up to do. LEDE is the very latest code including newest kernel, but can have bugs and after you have bin on trunk for a wile, if the kernel is updated in the trunk then it gets impossible to install packages with out first upgrading your firmware. I can say for shore that Gargoyle 1.9.1 has bin tested on a lot of c7s and is stable. It&#039;s only released after it&#039;s bin tested. Trunk builds for LEDE are never tested so if you don&#039;t know how to unbrick your router then you will be a bit stuck. Wen you first flash LEDE there is no user interface so you will have to SSH in and install luci. <br />(opkg update)<br />(opkg install luci)<br />If you have flashed the latest OEM fermwair then you will have to flash to ddwrt first and then flash over to Openwrt or Gargoyle. As there is a block on installing third party fermwair because of the FCC. Sorry I did not point this out be for as I flashed my c7 a long time ago and forgot about it. <br />You can see how to flash to ddwrt and then to wich ever firmware you go with here:<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=9140">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … amp;t=9140</a><br />Try and flash your LEDE or gargoyle befor flashing to ddwrt you will know if you have to flash to ddwrt first as it will say code 18005. It will not brick.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapper</strong> on 13 Sep 2016, 18:04)</p>

					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I have already bought about 5 Archer C7 V2 in the past (about one year ago) and successfully flashed OpenWrt CC 15.05, and I have bought one more now, still a V2, but I couldn&#039;t flash CC 15.05.1 and neither CC 15.05. It just wouldn&#039;t boot and I got it restored with the TFTP WPS button trick to original stock firmware which is 3.14.3 Build 150427 Rel.360706n and seems to be prior to the locking rules.</p><p>After I restored the stock firmware I tried several times reflashing OpenWRT until I opened the case and connected to serial to see what was going on and I stumbled into this:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[    2.100000] VFS: Cannot open root device &quot;(null)&quot; or unknown-block(0,0): error -6
[    2.100000] Please append a correct &quot;root=&quot; boot option; here are the available partitions:

[    2.110000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)</code></pre></div><p>After a lot of searching, I found that TP-Link for some reason may have changed the router flash chip without changing the version number and without any additional changes. After this I found this topic and read stangri&#039;s quote:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>While I personally run LEDE, considering all the follow-up questions I would also recommend OP to try Gargoyle first.</p><p>However, please be advised that:<br />1.

					<p>Hi again guys,</p><p>I haven&#039;t noticed but the OpenWRT wiki about Archer C7 has moved to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500.">wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500.</a> I didn&#039;t read the notice on the previous one about the change.</p><p>This new one has information regarding this V2 variant on &quot;Quick Start Guide&quot; and also has links to a version of 15.05.1 that some user made work with this variant. I have tested this and everything worked for me including 5GHz even though I haven&#039;t installed the firmware for the QCA9880-BR4A and the kmod-ath10k that it recommended, they seemed to be already included somehow.</p><p>What I don&#039;t understand is why don&#039;t the OpenWRT team host this working version alongside with the original or replace it (replace if this version works with both V2 versions, which is something I don&#039;t know).</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

The link I posted previously of zioncluster&#039;s firmware doesn&#039;t work with any kernel modules of 15.05.1, it only works with packages that doesn&#039;t have any kernel stuff (example: luci-ssl).<br />But I found the post you were referring to, it is this one: <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=330100#p330100">forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=330100#p330100</a>. I also can&#039;t post links, but somehow they work if you put between url tags and remove the htt&#039;p and ww&#039;w parts (the &#039; was used on purpose, I guess there is some word match expression to block these words).<br />I confirmed that it really works with everything from 15.05.1. Why don&#039;t OpenWRT team post this firmware on the official download location (if someone confirms it works with the older V2 versions)? I bet it will help out a lot of people.</p><p>Thank you MarioT!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>arthur.and</strong> on 22 Sep 2016, 19:56)</p>

					<p>Hmm, LEDE comes without Luci? If i download latest (<a href="http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/lede/snapshots/targets/ar71xx/generic/">http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/lede/ … x/generic/</a>) i get the system without GUI? No problem overall, but i dont like to try around. </p><p>Does a dirty flash working or do i have to make a clean install? Im on a Archer C5, flashed to a C7v2 with Openwrt build by arokh</p>									</div>
