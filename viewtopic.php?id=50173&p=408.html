					<p>Chadster! You have been my hero throughout all this. I see your name pop up everywhere. Thank you for all you&#039;ve done on this. I followed the instructions and now when I reset the router through:</p><p>Marvell&gt;&gt;&gt; reset</p><p>I&#039;m stuck on:</p><p>Loading kernel ... </p><p>and it freezes. Any ideas?

					<p>@nitroshift </p><p>May I ask how your use your edgerouter lite? Is that doing dhcp? or does that split your 1 ip to the two routers? I&#039;m looking into making a similar network setup since the wrt are unstable <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /> Mine went down 3 times 2 days ago then i turned off the wifi and used another router as an ap only to find the network went down as well and a reboot solved the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>@lifehacksback</p><p>My EdgeRouter Lite (running 1.8.0 firmware, no DHCP) is set up in 1WAN+2LAN mode. Its only job is to handle the PPPoE connection and split the connection in 2 separate LAN&#039;s that can&#039;t access each other (one is my home network and the other is for guests). On each network I have a static WAN address WRT1900AC with its own set of firewall rules and separate SSID&#039;s and passwords (in turn they are both running DHCP servers). I had to come up with this setup since the WRT1900AC can&#039;t handle a gigabit PPPoE connection.</p><p>nitroshift</p>									</div>

					<p>We should all remember OpenWRT is an international project with many of the devs and users living in countries where English is not the native language.&nbsp; </p><p>We shouldn&#039;t infer a specific tonality when we recognize the post is being made by a user whose native language is not English... especially if a translator app/website is being utilized, as sentence structure in most languages is completely different than the sentence structure in English.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JW0914</strong> on 10 Mar 2016, 17:17)</p>
