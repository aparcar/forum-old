					<p>So last night, I decided to get overly brave and do an SD card mod to my old WRT54G v2 router. I ended up toasting off RP3 with trying to solder the wires to it. After that, my LAN+WAN ports have stopped working. On the brighter side, my wireless is still working.</p><p>What I&#039;d really like to do is to replace the component I damaged. The component was labeled &quot;301&quot; and is exactly the same as RP4 and RP5. If someone could help me locate this part or help repair it; I&#039;d be very thankful.</p><p>A little more info on my router: it is a WRT54G v2 that has 32 MB of RAM. Printed on the board, it states that it is a WRT54GS REV:XB.</p><p>For some reference to where and what I was attempting to solder:<br />hxxp://kiel.kool.dk/pics/solderpoint_1_annotated.jpg<br />hxxp://michael-tech.blogspot.com/2007/12/adding-mmcsd-card-to-linksys-wrt54g.html</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, that&#039;s a 300 ohm quad resistor.&nbsp; Just replace it with 4 pieces of wire, it will work fine.</p><p>FWIW accessing SD with the 2.6 kernel causes segfaults, 2.4 is ok.</p>									</div>
