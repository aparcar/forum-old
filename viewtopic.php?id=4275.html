					<p>I finally got a change to play around with the DSM-G600 again, and mapped out the serial console. The following diagram assumes the case open with the power to the left, and the status LEDs to the right. Serial console is 9600 8N1. Processor is a MPC8245 V1.2 PPC. 32M RAM, 4M FLASH. See posts in the general board for dmesg output, etc. The serial console is the white connector between the CPU and the battery which has a pinout parallel to the front LEDs.&nbsp; Platform has raylink minipci and an ATA133 controller, as well as GigE and 2x USB2.0.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>

Can you get 100Mb speeds streaming off a normal workstation with an IDE drive in it? With a single drive, it&#039;s going to suck. Some of the bigger NAS boxes that let you stripe across 4 disks, they&#039;re still going to suck because they&#039;re doing parity calculations in the embedded CPU. If you want real NAS, get a real NAS head. If you want a multifunctional embedded appliance with does some cifs/nfs NAS on top of other stuff, these boxes are ideal because the aren&#039;t going to hammer the USB bus which could be used for other stuff.</p>									</div>

I&#039;m just using the thing with stock firmware until I finish up about 6 other projects. Then I&#039;m going to have a look at the kuro/gentoo install.

					<p>The rates under Samba seem typical.</p><p>I just ran some similar tests with an WRTSL54GS, using both USB 2.0 flash and a Seagate Barracuda-IV drive got same results of about 2.7 megs/sec.

					<p>Ok here is the deal. I tried to play with this a bit and I now beleive that I am in way over my head. I looked quite a bit for information about your reference and I have come to the conclusion. Im not that smart! I have an offer to paypal someone if they can change the &quot;fun_plug&quot; script for me and tell me how in detail to install it.&nbsp; The things I would like are to enable wifi by default so if the thing crashes or the power is pulled wifi will always boot. I would love to have a dhcp server installed and give devices that conect to it an ip address. If there is a way to have it boot faster that would be cool.&nbsp; Please let me know if you are interested and what compensation you would require.</p><p>Thank You much,<br />-Greg</p>									</div>

I&#039;m not going to have a chance to play with mine for a month or so. Good luck. If you can get a working kernel into U-Boot it would rock, because from there everything else should theoretically be easy. Updating U-Boot itself to support netbooting would be majorly helpful. It looks like the box is a standard motorola sandpoint dev platform. The Kuro-box/linkstation guys can probably help if you need pointers. Good luck.</p>									</div>
