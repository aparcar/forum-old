					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m running openwrt on my TP-Link router. My ISP has given me native IPv6 support, with an auto-configured address for the router, and a /64 subnet for me to use internally.</p><p>I can ping ipv6.google.com fine from the router, so everything is working at that end.</p><p>I&#039;ve set up radvd to publish the subnet to my internal network. When I first connect my PC (running Ubuntu Natty) then everything works: it gets an IPv6 address, and I can ping ipv6.google.com from my PC.</p><p>Unfortunately, some time later (I&#039;m not quite sure how much later; I usually only notice minutes later) the PC somehow loses IPv6 connectivity. Running ifconfig shows that the PC still has the same IPv6 addresses, &quot;ip -6 neigh show&quot; shows the router, and &quot;route -A inet6&quot; shows ::/0 routing via the router, but &quot;ping6 ipv6.google.com&quot; no longer works. </p><p>If I manually remove the IPv6 addresses from the network interface on the PC with ifconfig, and then add them back again, everything works again for a short time.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>The /etc/config/radvd file from my router is as follows:</p><p>config interface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option AdvSendAdvert&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option AdvManagedFlag&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option AdvOtherConfigFlag 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list client&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0</p><p>config prefix<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # If not specified, a non-link-local prefix of the interface is used<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list prefix&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;&lt;my subnet&gt;::/64&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option AdvOnLink&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option AdvAutonomous&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option AdvRouterAddr&nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option AdvValidLifetime &#039;infinity&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0</p><p>config route<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list prefix&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1</p><p>config rdnss<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # If not specified, the link-local address of the interface is used<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list addr&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1</p><p>config dnssl<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list suffix&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ignore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m also seeing unreliable routing between the wan and wifi on Backfire (10.03.1, r29592) .&nbsp; Sometimes it works, sometimes not.&nbsp; &nbsp;In my case I have the wan port plugged into an ethernet with native IPv6.&nbsp; I turn off all firewall initializations at init time. I also turn off IPv4 NAT, since I don&#039;t need it.&nbsp; I have radvd hand out a fresh /64 from my allocation and put a static route for this net into my head-end router (actually a Fedora-17 Linux box).</p><p>I get the feeling that something is timing out, like neighbor discovery, but haven&#039;t looked too hard yet.&nbsp; I was hoping someone here would have already gotten to the bottom of this.&nbsp; Surely folks are interested in routing IPv6 instead of just bridging it.</p><p>One thing that I found mentioned on a google hit that worked for the respondent was to bump the RtrAdvInterval way down.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t seem to help for me.</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;AdvSendAdvert&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ignore&#039; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;IgnoreIfMissing&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;AdvSourceLLAddress&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;AdvDefaultPreference&#039; &#039;medium&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;MinRtrAdvInterval&#039; &#039;3&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;MaxRtrAdvInterval&#039; &#039;10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;AdvReachableTime&#039; &#039;10&#039;</p><p>config &#039;prefix&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list &#039;prefix&#039; &#039;2001:5a8:4:XXXX::/64&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;AdvOnLink&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;AdvAutonomous&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;AdvRouterAddr&#039; &#039;0&#039;</p><p>config &#039;route&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list &#039;prefix&#039; &#039;2001:5a8:4:XXXX::/64&#039;</p><p>config &#039;rdnss&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list &#039;addr&#039; &#039;2001:5a8:4:7d0::1&#039;</p><p>config &#039;dnssl&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; list &#039;suffix&#039; &#039;XXXX.com&#039;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>wolfgang.rupprecht</strong> on 26 Jun 2012, 08:15)</p>
