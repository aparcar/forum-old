					<p>I want to reflash the original firmware on Zyxel P334-WT. I have some .bin of original firmware.<br />But all topics which describes restoring firmware refers to .trx file, and says its no problems - just cut head of .bin file for 32 bytes and u get it.<br />If so, than look to openwrt .bin and .trx files - U see that length of file different some more than 32bytes.<br />Try to look in hexdump - .trx file starts with HDR0 chars and same chars in .bin file starts after 0x018000 or more.<br />And more - the original firmware doesn&#039;t have HDR0 chars inside, so how I can get .trx from original firmware for Zyxel AMD5210 platform<br />and will insured that its right .trx image?<br />Maybe exist utility for verifying it before burn the flash?<br />I downloaded openwrt sources, build it and found some structure which writed to start of .bin file and its length is 48 bytes.&nbsp; <br />(as minimum)<br />Can anybody explain: How to get the right .trx file from non-openwrt .bin firmware?<br />I just dont want to search JTAG while current box is works and have mtd.<br />And more - pages for TFTP method reflashing refers to .bin image for burn. Is it right for Zyxel also?</p>									</div>
