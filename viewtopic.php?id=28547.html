					<p>I was looking at an old Netgear router firmware I have here, the WGR614v7 and I noticed there was a log kept of which websites had been visited that could be accessed in the web administration. I wanted to see how difficult it would be to duplicate that function for my WNDR3700 OpenWRT build using dsniff. It turns out it is trivial and the script I came up with does even more.</p><p>1. Takes variables for the mountpoint of your USB storage and the network or interface you wish to monitor.<br />2. Is activated when the WPS button is pressed so long as the USB storage is mounted and the network interface specified exists (you can also use bridged interfaces such as br-lan).<br />3. When the WPS button is pressed the power LED goes out and a directory is created called dragnet on the root of your USB storage. Inside there are 4 files... passwords, url , mail , messages. <br />4. If the WPS button is pressed again the unit reboots.</p><p>passwords of numerous protocols, any URL visited, email -&nbsp; pop, smtp or imap and instant messages are recorded respectively. SSL covered communications are not harvested. In this version.</p><p>So there it is. At the touch of a button. But please do not use this to invade peoples privacy. Its a proof of concept for those wanting to see how such a system might work. As far as performance penalty, hardly noticeable for web pages, significant for http downloads, and none existent for torrents.</p><br /><p>The dsniff package must be installed for this to operate.</p><p>/etc/hotplug.d/button/50-dragnet</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
