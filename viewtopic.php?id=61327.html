					<p>Hello! Big thanks to the OpenWRT community for the great info!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a Thomson Speedtouch 706 where the firmware got heavily obfuscated by my ISP (online.nl)<br />All possible logins (http, ftp, telnet, serial) where tested with many common user names (Administrator, admin, orange, online, adsl)<br />I consider it a challenge to be able to root the device.</p><p>So with help from OpenWRT&#039;s info on Speedtouch 7G and ST706WL i successfully dumped the flash with urtag.<br />Below will be the command line output.</p><p>My chip layout is different from the ST706WL:<br />CPU: Broadcom bcm6348 (really awful manufacturer&#039;s data sheet)<br />Flash: Spansion S29GL032A90TFIR4 (4GB afaik)<br />sdram: Hynix HY57V281620FTP-H (different online sources claim different sizes)</p><p>It took about 5 hours to dump the 4GB flash using a Raspberry Pi as a jtag dongle.<br />Many analysis on the flash dump failed. Hexdump, strings and binwalk didn&#039;t help much other than producing broken .gz files. Mounting a filesystem seems completely out of the question.<br />So my next plan is to try and manipulate the sdram on the fly. But i need some help with this.</p><p>Questions:<br />- can i safely read the sdram while the device is running? or does jtag only work in the boot phase?<br />- how can i find out on what address i can read the sdram?<br />- any other ideas/comments?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ sudo jtag

					<p>Post a link to your dump and I&#039;ll have a peek. Those routers usually use something like a ZyNOS-alike mess of an OS, or something like VxWorks. No Linux AFAIK. </p><p>By the way, try dumping the flash multiple times and compare the outputs with MD5 or SHA, if they differ you might have corruption in transit.</p>									</div>
