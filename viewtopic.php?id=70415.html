					<p>Hi</p><p>I have had the chance to play with a HomeHub 5B.</p><p>Under the cover, most of the clockwork is obscured by a heat sink, which can be carefully removed by heating the solder points on the underside to reveal a Broadcom chip labelled BCM63168UKFEBG.&nbsp; I understand other routers based on the BCM63168 are supported -- there is an OpenWRT page on this chip.&nbsp; I have found a likely UART port next to the chip.</p><p>I have photos but unfortunately the forum won&#039;t let me post them, so I have put them on the Wikidevi page for the device.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sherm2000</strong> on 31 Mar 2017, 12:36)</p>

					<p>I really don&#039;t need the DSL modem working, nor the wireless. I really need it working as a firewall, so if the SOC and switch are supported, I would be more than happy to deploy and be the guinea pig <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks!<br />Dario</p>									</div>
