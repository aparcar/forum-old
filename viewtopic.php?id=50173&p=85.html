					<p>@kaloz</p><p>Ill try to work on it but everyones builds are so janky no offense I really mean that... no offense but it is bleeding edge... I havent bricked but one of kaloz offered no usb or was that mcwrt version... ive built em all... figured out how to incorporate old packages in the feeds and am just building everything I need on the img... fwiw if you are building for others to use please by all means have every single build package every single devel package every single package you can think of... lib usb has issues but after I bloated my fedora vmware another couple of gigs and installed EVERYTHING that wouldnt break yum ive got a stable build for what I need... but this is again really catered I didnt build samba or a lot of things I hear people in here discussing</p><p>Ill let you know about my wifi and what its doing...</p><p>I can put my gawk package up if you want, along with ngrep and ncat... sed and grep...</p><p>Also it seems everyone has a different flavor of what iptables should look like... it just gets confusing... I dont want a rat maze plus moat at my front door just a dead bolt...</p><p>My advice... unless you really can use ipv6 just disable it... it makes things really hairy when a client is double booked... I think this is probably causing some nat grief...</p><p>Anyhow ill give my build a few and report back</p><p>As far as the pivot. I think thats gonna have to be an option or additional file for build cause fstab seems to burned in the image and will either have to be changed pre build or the entire ubi0_1 block device removed</p><p>My two cents</p>									</div>

					<p>More two cents cause I ghost wrote that hours ago... if you are switching back and forth it doesnt matter if you save your settings to transfer over... if it gets janky just ssh into root and delete all of /overlay... you wont be able to command reboot just power down and then on and it will be fresh...</p><p>Two points for those that think they have bricked... you more than likely have a stale arp on either your pc or router or both... disconnect both for a min or so reboot the router and try again...&nbsp; you may have done something strange with interfaces cause they are set up really wierd as is iptables... if your getting the 169.whatever as a subnet you have two options that dont involve ttl or serial or whatever...</p><p>First 30-30-30... have we all gone noob on this?</p><p>Second connect upstream to the box instead of down stream... just plug the wan into another router and connect through the other router through the wan port..</p><p>Also guys if you think youve been locked out cause you made a booboo remember if openwrt is fresh with no luci just telnet to whatever gateway your dhcp shows and just type passwd</p><p>Then of course<br />sed -i &#039;s/\#//g&#039; /etc/opkg.conf ; opkg update ; opkg install luci-ssh ; opkg install luci-theme-openwrt</p><p>Then again sed might not be in busy box, and why the hell isn&#039;t bc in busy box geez...</p>									</div>

					<p>My 2.5 cents worth............</p><p>I have tried every image since day 1 of Chadster&#039;s first release. I have NEVER had to use my ttl cable. I NEVER flash an image without flashing Linksys Stock first. I am running Life&#039;s 2nd latest release, when I update to the most recent, I will flash Linksys stock and let it setup, find the internet....etc....etc., before I flash any alternative image. I NEVER flash from one OpenWrt/Custom image to another. Everyone needs to realize that these are all in new/testing stage, if you can&#039;t recover the router from doorstop status, I would suggest not trying any alternative image until a stable proven release.&nbsp; It is &quot;use at your own risk&quot; after all.</p>									</div>

					<p>It may determine that there is exactly one &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot;&gt; on the page, and auto-fill the password as it knows exactly one password for the site. Doesn&#039;t sound that unreasonable to me, most auto-fillers try to be helpful above strict. I&#039;ve accidentally renamed multiple articles on a website I manage due to the article title field being detected as a username field, and then auto-filled. </p><p>McWRT is AA-based, I suppose it has the old LuCI theme, which may explain why it isn&#039;t affected. Whether this is issue belongs to LuCI or the auto-filler in use I&#039;m not sure.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well the password issue is fixed, removing the saved password has restored the auth key in the wireless area to what it should be. I don&#039;t need to save it on the main login page so I&#039;m all set.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>									</div>
