By the way I changed the ethernet port seeting to dhcp client ( to connect to my modem and download packages) and installed samba and ntfs-3g. After that I could not access the LuCI via WiFi and ethernet. Later I reset the device using USB2TTL adapter. But now I cannot close the device since jumper wires are blocking the top cover.
