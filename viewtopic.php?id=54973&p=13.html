					<p>I started using tha same method to extract caldata.<br />And it also worked for extraction in EA8500.<br />But the problem I found was when you tried to change the MAC address as that method doesn&#039;t recalculate the checksum for the new data accordingly. Then on boot the driver would complain and ended with a crash.<br />Thus the new package, it adds the checksum recalc.</p><p>Today I corrected the place where the script was being called, as previously it was called after the driver loaded, so on first boot it didn&#039;t have caldata and so no wifi (on reboot it had the files from previous boot, so eventually it worked).</p><p>What specific problem are you having with wifi MAC address?
