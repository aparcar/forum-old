					<p>I&#039;ve been searching around Google for quite some time and can&#039;t seem to find a correct answer to my issue. I imagine, like most times Google doesn&#039;t seeem to have the answer, my search terms just aren&#039;t correct.</p><p>So, I have ~20 phones connected to an OpenWRT router which connect to a SIP and Cloud Based PBX provider (VocalCloud, if that helps anyone). Occassionally the phones will disconnect for less than a minute and then reconnect (the Advanced logs of the cloud based PBX show the phones disconnecting and reconnecting). I&#039;m told by Vocalcloud that this is generally due to NAT keep alive issues. I&#039;ve looked around a bit, and I don&#039;t see anything labeled as such in OpenWRT. I&#039;ve also tried siproxd, but it didn&#039;t seem to do what I need done, and I&#039;m afraid it doesn&#039;t look quite right. They&#039;ve stated that any VOiP options in routers are generally going to interfere with the correct working of the phone system, and that it&#039;s almost always a NAT Keep alive issue, or other lan problem.</p><p>Does anyone have any pointers, suggestions, search terms or possibilties?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DynamoGeek</strong> on 16 Sep 2013, 19:47)</p>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Maybe you should create iptables rules in the raw table, and use &quot;-j CT --no-track&quot; as explained here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.server#throughput.issues">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs. â€¦ put.issues</a><br />Of course you will need to rewrite that rules to suit your needs.<br />Another option could be looking inside &quot;/proc/sys/net/netfilter/&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gsenna</strong> on 16 Sep 2013, 20:32)</p>

					<p>Hey gsenna,</p><p>Thanks for your answer! <br />After a little searching, though, it looks like all I&#039;m telling it to do with the &#039;notrack&#039; is not track that connection to save some router resources. Am I incorrect in that assumption? What I&#039;m wanting it to do is leave the holes created with NAT open longer, or indefinitely (until specifically closed)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for jumping in, mikma.</p><p>Some poking around reveals that SIP conntrack type things might be included in &quot;iptables-mod-conntrack-extra&quot; or &quot;kmod-ipt-conntrack-extra&quot;. As I understand, though, it&#039;s not wise to remove those packages. Do you have any light to shine on either of those modules? When I was messing around with Gargoyle, I found some options to disable (or was it enable?

					<p>I did find the udp timeout options in /etc/sysctl.conf. The suggestion from the SIP/PBX provider is to increase the udp timeout options to 5 minutes or longer, which I&#039;ve done.

					<p>for some devices/servers even 5 minutes is too short (often what i have seen is that an keepalive is send once an hour if at all), but they do often have an option nat_keep_alive or an option that says it is behind a nat. then it will send a null packet pretty often.</p><p>Often this solves it.

					<p>Hey FriedZombie, thanks for bringing your experience in.</p><p>I&#039;m told they have the devices/servers setup to send/receive the keepalives properly (or at least, at specific intervals, I believe the keepalives are once every 5 minutes, and re-registration is some higher number). The thing that&#039;s confusing me the most is that it&#039;s going unreachable and reachable completely randomly. So, it&#039;ll say &quot;peer XXX has gone unreachable&quot; and then a very short time later it comes back to reachable.&nbsp; Of all the things I&#039;ve found, nothing concrete says why a phone would go unreachable randomly like that, and then go immediately back to reachable.</p>									</div>

When a (VoIP) device (ATA) i&#039;s attached to such a NAT/Firewall router, it&#039;s responsible to inform the NAT/Firewall router to maintain a NAT keep-alive on the ports it is still using. In this case, the VoIP device (ATA) will periodically send out some traffics on the ports. This will reset the timer on the router that maintains the ports. On my Linksys PAP2, its <strong>NAT Keep Alive Intvl</strong> (under SIP tab) is set to 45 seconds and I have never encountered any problem with it. Some NAT/Firewall router has a longer/shorter default settings to reset an unused port. If your OpenWRT NAT/Firewall router&#039;s default setting is 1 minute, it is always safe to configure your ATA device with its <strong>NAT Keep Alive Intvl</strong> less than 1 minute.</p>									</div>
