					<p>Hi,</p><p>i&#039;m going to use OpenWRT on five APs (mainly linksys) which are connect by a wire and going to provide a shared net with the same SSID and maybe the same channel.</p><p>I&#039;ve set up the main ap with connection to the private net with an openvpn, dhcp and openntp server. Each ap merges the wireless wifi the the wired net, on the main ap on port got seperated for the private net to be only accesable via openvpn.</p><p>I really found alot about setting up WDS but as to the APs don&#039;t need to be able to access each other wireless, WDS might not be the best thing. But as to the APs bridging wired and wireless net, how should openwrt differenciate between a wireless connection and a wired connection on a bridged device?</p><p>Is using WDS on a bridged wireless and wired net the only / best way to provided the Extended Service Set (meaning the same as wds over ethernet)?</p><p>thanks a lot in advance,<br />&nbsp; sincerly,&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;M. Braun</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess a setup like this could work:</p><br /><p>Internet &lt;---&gt; Router 1 &lt;-------------&gt; Router 2</p><p>Where all connections (or both connections) are wired.</p><p>Router 1 is set in AP Mode with Router settings.</p><p>Router 2 is set in AP Mode only, with a LAN port connected to a LAN port on Router 1.</p><p>In Router 2 you disable routing and you need on Router 2 to NOT run DHCP server - so that both use the DHCP server on router 1.</p><p>In this way Router 2 should work as a switch, with both wired and wireless connections beeing a part of the &quot;bridged interfaces&quot; of the switch.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>macsat</strong> on 13 Mar 2006, 14:27)</p>
