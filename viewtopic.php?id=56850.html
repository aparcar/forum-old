					<p>The Tarlogic Team (Acrylic WiFi) has released a new package for OpenWrt (Barrier Breaker) based on hostapd-v2.2 and the hostapd-WPE (Wireless Pwnage Edition) patch.</p><p>The WPE patch implements 802.1X authentication server impersonation attacks in order to obtain client credentials, but also implements Cupid attack, allowing to exploit heartbleed vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) on client connections over EAP-PEAP/TLS/TTLS.</p><p>Hostapd-WPE is a handy project in order to test WPA Enterprise infraestructures when performing WiFi security tests.</p><p>Ipks have been created for all supported architectures. The following link includes the package and a brief tutorial detailing the cross-compiling procedure.</p><p><a href="https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/blog/hostapd-wpe-openwrt-barrier-breaker/">https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/blog/hos â€¦ r-breaker/</a></p><p>Greetings</p>									</div>
