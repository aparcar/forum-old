					<p>Hi, I was hoping you guys could help me by recommending hardware for a project I&#039;m creating.</p><p>I&#039;m looking to place a router in a remote location, powered by solar and battery. It will be off most of the time, but a passerby will be able to turn it on. Router will boot and provide a wifi network that clients will be able to join. Router will provide a captive portal where users can sign a virtual guest book for the remote location. Data is POSTed to a small DB server on the router, and users can view previous guestbook entries that have been left. There will be no internet connectivity.</p><p>So the requirements as I see them:<br />Wifi router<br />small http server<br />captive portal to redirect all traffic to http server<br />small db server<br />some kind of scripting language to post data from http server to db<br />low-ish power due to battery/solar setup</p><p>I&#039;ve never worked with OpenWRT previously, but I&#039;ve done some sysadmin work so I&#039;m not a total beginner. Happy to spend a few extra bucks to buy the hardware that will give me as few headaches as possible.</p><p>Thanks!<br />John</p>									</div>

					<p>The <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/29972/trunk">TP-Link TL-MR11U</a> is supposed to work with a battery.</p><p>In case the usual 4 or 8MiB of flash memory won&#039;t be enough, you could use a USB stick. Then you also require an USB port.</p><p>How do you want to turn it on and off?</p>									</div>

					<p>I was planning on turning it on and off by controlling the power supply, just giving it power when I want it on, and cutting power when I want it off, but there will be embedded electronics in the box too (arduino) so I can wire up control of hardware buttons on the router&#039;s board too.</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting description, but the simplicity is quite attractive. I&#039;m curious about two things:</p><p>Wifi access, but no internet connectivity. If there&#039;s no connectivity, why should users bother with a wifi connection?</p><p>&quot;Data is POSTed to a small DB server&quot; - is this for storing the guestbook entries? I think that something VERY simple would suffice - SQLite is almost more than you need, but I don&#039;t see anything &quot;lighter.&quot; Even a [urlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_file]flat file[/url] is probably enough. Get clever!</p>									</div>
