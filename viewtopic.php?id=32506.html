					<p>Hi, first I&#039;d like to start saying that I&#039;ve read many posts about this problems, many solved, some others in &quot;not solved&quot; status..<br />I&#039;ve read the wiki. And I&#039;am new at this, as far as flashing and vlans concepts are concerned.<br />I flashed my wrt54g v1.1 with backfire rc-5. I was able to access thru web and ssh.&nbsp; I tried,with no success at all, to set the wrt54g as AP and Client mode at the same time.<br />I tried editting the network and wireless files at /etc/conf directory.<br />I had the wrt54g ip at 192.168.1.1, my internet router (with DHCP enabled) at 192.168.1.254. Never was able to connect to the internet router.<br />Reading, I realized I had to change thewrt54g ip, so I did, I changed it to 192.168.2.1.<br />From that moment on, I have not been able to access it anymore thru ethernet. Error &quot;cable not connected&quot;<br />I Knew Iit was at 192.168.2.1. But could not access it. Used nmap to 192.168.2.0/24 and it detected it. I ping to it and responded.<br />I opened up a terminal and change my ip to 192.168.2.55...I got&nbsp; an error, but was able to get in..:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ipconfig 192.168.2.55 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; ssh root@192.168.2.1<br />And I can enter the wrt54g....Triedto see the network config but it seems to me it&#039;s fine. I have 3 weeks like this and I&#039;m about to trash it, dump it...But before that, I need to know if there is something else I can do..I&#039;m almost sure the router just broke.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
