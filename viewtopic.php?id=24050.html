					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I recently decided to finally flash my DIR-615 (C1) with OpenWRT (Backfire 10.03-rc1) and have run into some difficulties that I&#039;m hoping the OpenWRT community can help me resolve.</p><p>A bit of background:</p><p>I edited the firmware image (openwrt-ar71xx-dir-615-c1-squashfs-factory.bin) by adding an extra &#039;00&#039; before the identifier code to get past the D-Link firmware check. Before flashing I was running the 3.11NA stock D-Link firmware. After flashing I was able to telnet into the server to setup ssh access. At this point I was able to ssh and access the Luci web interface. However, upon attempting to run &#039;opkg update&#039; I recieved a &quot;Bad download&quot; error. I realized that the router was not receiving an IP address (I wasn&#039;t able to ping by IP address either leading me to discount a DNS issue). After searching around unsuccessfully for a solution I ended up changing the VLAN configuration which leads me to current dilemma. I&#039;m not sure exactly what I did to the interface configuration, but it&#039;s left me unable to either SSH in or access the web interface. IIRC, the normal ethernet ports were under eth0 while the WAN was listed under eth1. I believe that I set eth1 to bridge eth0.1 but I&#039;m not positive.</p><p>[s]My first question then is, how can I reset the configuration so I can ssh or access the web interface again?[/s] Solved thanks to Recar_Deeps <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=105415#p105415">suggestion</a></p><p>Second, does anyone have any suggestions as to solving the issue that led me here: how to get the router to get an IP address? I realize this is a vague question so if you could suggest what information I should include after solving the first problem in order to get useful answers I would be appreciative.</p><p>Thanks for any help you can give me, and please let me know what other information you need.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nigelt</strong> on 29 Mar 2010, 00:01)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not familiar with the DIR-615 and it&#039;s flashing methods, but I prefer to always flash via TFTP.&nbsp; I would suggest reflashing with the latest Backfire image via TFTP (from bootloader - you should be able to find TFTPing instructions for your router in the wiki)... that should get you out of your current dilemma.&nbsp; As for solving the issue that got you there, perhaps someone else can make a suggestion.</p>									</div>

					<p>dir-615c1 and c2 has only 4Mbyte flash and only 3.8Mbyte size You can use for openwrt -- about 200 kb is a web recovery partition.</p><p>That is why image for dir-615 always is 3.8Mbyte in size. More size will kill web recovery data.</p><p>If You want to use more packages then You should use squash image because squas-fs has better compression level then others fs. The bad side of squashfs it is readonly fs. If You do any changes they are saved in a small partition ... so if You did upgrade of some pkg then probably You got no space left for changes.</p><p>If You want upgrade then compile Your own trunk with needed pkgs and do sysupgrade. All Your settings should be saved.</p><p>I did such trunk for me and sysupgrade several times with no problem. First openwrt flashing I did from web recovery mode with no need to edit openwrt image.</p><p>About interfaces: eth0 is lan and eth1 is wan. AFAIK switck in dir-615 does not support vlans in openwrt or at all. You should bridge eth0 with wl0 -- this will be traditional openwrt way dealing with Wi-Fi <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>Getting the router&#039;s DHCP server to send IP addresses to Clients would depend upon your router negotiating an Internet connection with your ISP. You could try this but it mostly depends on ISP account. Mine is dynamic DHCP but doesn&#039;t require me to clone my PC&#039;s MAC address to router&#039;s MAC. All I have to do is remove power to router, cycle modem power and wait until modem is ready, then apply power to router.</p><p>When flashing the DIR-615 from recovery mode, use a static IP with only PC connected to LAN. The flash will stop at 100% but typically you should wait before removing power to make sure the NVRAM initializes correctly. Remove router power then set your PC to obtain IP automatically and then cycle modem power. Another good habit to get in is to hard reset the router using the 30-30-30 and reset button before and after a flash.</p><p>Did you read the WIP thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=98648">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=98648</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;I think around page 9 or 10 of the thread, the trunk flash method gets some attention.</p>									</div>
