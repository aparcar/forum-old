					<p>Well - as according to other posts people got it to work in exactly this combination AWUS036H+mr3020 I do the believe the mr3020 itself is capable of suppling sufficient power for this wifi card (and as the mr3020 is connected to a 10W power supply I am confident the router itself gets sufficient power as well).</p>									</div>
