					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve followed the tutorial on &quot;Basic essentials to IPv6&quot; and also &quot;How-to on Backfire&quot; - I followed them completed as said (enabled IPv6 support, restarting networking, ensure everything is set 100% in the sys config, everything).</p><p>Now, the only problem is.. I still can&#039;t pull a IPv6 address for some reason; it&#039;ll pull a LAN based one, but not a &quot;Scope Global&quot; - I re-installed with a fresh installation of Backfire 10.03.1 and now I&#039;m going to give it a go again, however, I think I might hold off and see if anyone has a tutorial/suggestions of what I should do step by step instead of going based off the tutorials?</p><p>Now - if I don&#039;t hookup my OpenWRT router at all (WZR-HP-G300NH) and just connect directly into my modem (DOCISS 3.0 Thomson), I&#039;ll pull a IPv6 address as well as a IPv4 (ipv6-test results in it being a 6in4 address, mapped to my IPv4 address).</p><p>Everything on my router is set default right now, I don&#039;t want to keep having to re-flash it; hopefully anyone will have any guides or something I can follow more clearly. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>What is your basic setup? ISP gives a native ipv6 address through router advertising? dhcpv6? (I get a bit confused as you talk about an &quot;6in4 address&quot;, but do not mention how the address is supposed to get assigned.)</p><p>And 6in4 and 6to4 are two separate things, so make sure that you are not mixing them.</p><p>Divide the problem to two steps: making sure that the router itself gets and uses ipv6 address, and providing ipv6 connectivity to the clients.</p><p>Does your router get full ipv6 functionality? Can you ping ipv6.google.com from router console?<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# ping ipv6.google.com
