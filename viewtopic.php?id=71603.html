					<p>Hi,</p><p>I need a regular Ethernet hub and found my old TPLink WR1043ND (v1) with OpenWRT lying in the garage, so I thought about using it for this purpose.</p><p>I found the dumbap and the bridgeap recipes in the docs and inspired from them. My goal is to have all the available Ethernet ports available, as a regular Ethernet hub (WAN or LAN, does not matter).</p><br /><p>I ended up with the following /etc/config/network:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan
        option type     &#039;bridge&#039;
        option ifname   &#039;eth0&#039;  # Bridges vlan 1 and wan
        option proto    &#039;dhcp&#039;         # Change as appropriate</code></pre></div><p>I use dhcp as my upstream router can provide my OpenWRT router an IP with dhcp. The OpenWRT router gets an IP assigned and has access to Internet. However, no other client from my OpenWRT router can contact (ping / get an IP from DHCP) the upstream router. They send DHCPDISCOVER but it seems it is never transmitted through OpenWRT router.</p><p>I disabled the built-in DHCP server from my OpenWRT router as well as any firewall.</p><p>What am I missing? Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phyks</strong> on 24 Jul 2017, 00:03)</p>

					<p>I guess I missed something. It might be the issue here, but ifconfig only gives me br-lan and eth0, plus the wifi interface. What should the interfaces be?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>EDIT: Oh, your last post got me thinking and I managed to sort it out.
