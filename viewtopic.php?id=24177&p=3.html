					<p>Thank you Borromini for your reply.</p><p>When you already know where the information is then it is easy. Believe me, I have done several google searches and have not found much information. I already saw kirkwood downloads from OpenWrt download area, but not how to install those in a SheevaPlug.</p><p>The linked instructions explain how to boot from tftp server, but not how to install in into NAND or a USB device which is what I would prefer. If you already have done it, could you please write a small installation instructions post.</p><p>Than you for your information. It is a good start point.</p>									</div>

					<p>Tuzzer, thanks for having tested a reduced openwrt build. Now that we know that it&#039;s not enough anyway, the next question is &quot;which new router&quot;? All I can find here in Italy are Linksys WRT54GL, that work with Kamikaze 7.09 but cannot run anything bigger than that.</p>									</div>
