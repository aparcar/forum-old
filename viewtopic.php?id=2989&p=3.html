</p><p>Personally I like the way the box turned out and the last two the best.&nbsp; It&#039;s always good to have variety and to have a logo that can be printed in either black or white seems like a good idea.&nbsp; The only reason I prefer the last one (4.simple) over the first one (1.shadow) is because I like the idea of the shadow being only inside the box, like a metaphor for a brain&#039;s grey matter in a box.&nbsp; Also it can be reversed in the black background version.&nbsp; Though I still think the words, &quot;wireless freedom&quot; should either be in caps or larger on the bottom or both, like in the original busybox welcome screen that will also supposedly show up in the RC4 web interface (as it shows in the current pre-RC4 nbd version).&nbsp; This way I think with the, &quot;WIRELESS FREEDOM&quot; still close in font size to the, &quot;OpenWrt&quot; letters, it will be more visible in different scales, especially as it is shrunken down to shirt-pin size or something.&nbsp; </p><p>Very nice though, and because you are much more of a better artist as seen most obviously with the box and improved lettering, I think it is a worthy challenger to any fancy graphic.&nbsp; After all, on IRC, mere mention of the term, &quot;GUI&quot; warrants a shooting as stated in the room topic.&nbsp; As of course I&#039;m biased, I think the busybox lookalike should be the winner, though of course, mbm is always free to change the busybox ascii art too.&nbsp; Maybe some, WRT-type logo with a big eared (((\&gt;penguin inside&lt;/))) surfing waves.&nbsp; hehehe. </p><br /><br /><p>Well, I was going to let alej00d win, but out of divine inspiration, I have found it necessary to claim victory for myself.&nbsp; Read on and understand my explanation:</p><p>Well, actually I have also decided to submit some graphics that will completely quash any other competitors in the category of graphic based logo design as you will see below.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>First I made the big mean tough OpenWrt logo:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/BIG.jpg" alt="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/BIG.jpg" /></span></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Then I decided to make a smaller version where everything fit inside the O:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/CIRCLE.jpg" alt="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/CIRCLE.jpg" /></span></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Of course that was too small I made a concession in between with some waves:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/WAVES.jpg" alt="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/WAVES.jpg" /></span></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>And finally my masterpiece which has all facets of which any wireless graphic should include (penguin, linksys box, wireless antennas - used as ears even!, radio waves and &quot;surfing&quot;).&nbsp; This is surely my best work and is the final comment on all possible graphic entries into this logo contest.&nbsp; I am sure it will never be surpassed by anyone except Leonardo Da Vinci himself!...</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/BESTONE.jpg" alt="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/BESTONE.jpg" /></span></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Of course because I know that my striking masterpiece will influence all the programmers of OpenWrt and even Busybox itself, I have submitted a rough draft of what improvement can also be made to such login welcome screen and implemented into a logo also as a mere suggestion.&nbsp; </p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/PENGUINSURFER.jpg" alt="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/PENGUINSURFER.jpg" /></span></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>For scaling down purposes and to save ink in printers, there is also this masterful version of beautiful simplicity:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/STICKSURFER.jpg" alt="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/STICKSURFER.jpg" /></span></p><p>You are welcome, mbm and everyone else.&nbsp; Oh. and Thank you alej00d for fostering my creative side and allowing me the motivation to expand on my excellent artistic abilities.&nbsp; I shall perhaps allow you to attend one of my showings of logo and ascii art in one of my future showings.</p><p>I think it is about time that everyone here at OpenWrt take me seriously in the open source logo and ascii art community.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your praise, appreciation and bestowment of great artistic honours.</p><p>P.S. Just in case you think I jest, I implore you to examine to minute detail the miniscule nuances of artistic expression which surely must elucidate upon you the great amount of effort and time in terms of creative power have been exerted just for the very creation of this series of complete masterpieces.&nbsp; This is not the work of a mere fleeting moment of creative exploration, but a pinnacle of excellence which will never again be surmounted in the world of open source logo and ascii art.&nbsp; Consider yourself a witness to the moment in history which defines all artistic expression henceforth between humanity and the newly evolving world of digital interaction with the multi-universe as it progresses onward past the first step toward an infinity of communication which you have now become a willing participant of during your own lifetime!&nbsp; All of humanity which comes after you will be asking about this moment and hounding you until you&#039;ve answered their cries for knowledge about this era and what you have just seen.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Thank you for allowing me to complete this contest and bring it to a close with my final submission:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/BESTONE.jpg" alt="http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c226/rockygryphon/BESTONE.jpg" /></span></p><br /><br /><br /><p>With Kindest Regards, </p><p>RockyGryphon</p>									</div>

					<p>What sort of multi-tool?

					<p>I like the openbox idea, but the perspective on the flaps doesn&#039;t seem right. Here&#039;s my suggestion to fix the flaps (I&#039;m no artist, so this piece of junk was whipped together in PowerPoint..). Regarding the idea, I think the box-logo is really good, as people often refer to their routers as boxes (the openness of the box is self-evident)..</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://thesubmachine.com/~vahonen/openwrt.gif" alt="http://thesubmachine.com/~vahonen/openwrt.gif" /></span></p>									</div>
