					<p>I followed the instructions in the wiki about how to propose patches and such to get a new device part of the trunk and posted to the developers maillist but there was no interest. I&#039;ve already done all the work and am using said devices for a project. What do I need to do to make this device a standard device (HooToo TM02). Everything is done and tested. Aside from a post to the maillist in the requested format, what else?</p><p>Thx,<br />Ron</p>									</div>
