					<p>I flashed the wndr3700 with an image from gzone.com/openwrt (OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-r40431 / LuCI 0.11 Branch (0.11+svn10180))</p><p>and I have two things to say.</p><p>The first is that I have been trying to use openwrt as a pxe boot server, however, for some reason when booting using pxe, grub is telling me that nfs over tcp is not available. I noticed that nfsd is not installed nor is the server, and when I try installing it, I get dependency errors.</p><p>Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/packages/kmod-fs-nfsd_3.3.8-1_ar71xx.ipk.">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … r71xx.ipk.</a><br/>Collected errors:<br/> * satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-fs-nfsd:<br/> * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.3.8-1-d6597ebf6203328d3519ea3c3371a493) * &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.3.8-1-d6597ebf6203328d3519ea3c3371a493) * <br/> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-fs-nfsd.</p><p>Secondly I would like to know what is going on in the wan side in this build. It shows that multi-wan is disabled and there doesn&#039;t seem to be any indication that it is enabled at all, however as I am subscribed for a 175/30Mbit fibre service, I am seeing 380/30. Not that I&#039;m complaining, I just don&#039;t know what is going on. I have done tests from ookla, Aliant, Bell, Rogers. I would have never noticed this increase in download speed if it hadn&#039;t been for downloading a file in less than 20 seconds that would have normally took ~4 minutes.</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp; wshaper is the cause of this in an unconfigured state. Speed testing sites around the globe report 200-380 Mbps with wshaper and 80-175 Mbps without wshaper. Real world download speeds using multiple instances with wshaper resulted in 30MB/s and without, 17MB/s (rounding down). Far below synthetic online tests, but still significantly faster than what I am provisioned for.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lotacus</strong> on 25 May 2014, 15:53)</p>

					<p>IPSec just isn&#039;t practical as a VPN setup, lots of hotspots don&#039;t offer passthrough. Decided to look into OpenVPN and thus r40876 is born. Once booted, you can find /etc/openvpn/OpenWRT.ovpn generated for you. Transfer it securely to your client and launch your favorite OpenVPN client (tested with TunnelBlick and the app &quot;OpenVPN for Android&quot;). The ovpn profile is complete with your own generated static key and current wan ip. It&#039;s configured for only one VPN client, point to point with static key. UDP port 443. Also has a hotplug script to launch igmpproxy when client is connected.</p>									</div>
