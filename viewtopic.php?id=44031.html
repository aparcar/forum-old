					<p>Hi!<br />Sorry perhaps I am asking a wrong/naive question. I am not a computer professional.</p><p>As far as I understand, OpenWRT uses a program called &quot;udhcpc&quot; in order to obtain an IP address on the WAN.<br />When it starts the DHCP protocol, it broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER &quot;to every computer available&quot; on the WAN --- right?<br />For some reason, on my WAN two servers respond. One of them is good, and another is bad <br />(could even be a man in the middle).<br />I want to &quot;filter out&quot; the bad one. Somewhere in the configuration files of udhcpc, is there a &quot;reject&quot; option?<br />Perhaps I could write somewhere:</p><p>reject &#039;123.45.67.89&#039;</p><p>so that udhcpc simply ignores whatever comes from the IP address 123.45.67.89 ?<br />Thanks a lot in advance!<br />Andrei<br />P.S.: in my particular case, the rogue server always sends NAK. I am not sure what is going on, I simply want to filter it out.</p>									</div>

					<p>I do think it is possible, not sure though</p><p>you could drop incomming traffic from that ip:<br />just add it under custom firewall rules</p><p>iptables -A input_rule -s 123.45.67.89 -j DROP</p><p>but if you want you could also block the specific ports for that ip</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 7 May 2013, 00:08)</p>

					<p>Surprizingly, it seems that the iptables (as suggested by FriedZombie) do not work for DHCPOFFER. <br />There are many discussions of this on the forums, which I was not able to understand.<br />Seems like it is impossible to filter out DHCPOFFER by iptables, as is ``not a normal packet, but sort of an exception&#039;&#039;<br />There must be some mechanism within udhcpc !</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I half expected it not to work to be honest, but never had to cope with a issue like this.</p><p>maybe an other thing that could work (not sure again) is changing the /lib/netifd/dhcp.script a bit<br />under:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> setup_interface () { </code></pre></div><p>add the line:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> [ &quot;$serverid&quot; = &quot;123.45.67.89&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exit </code></pre></div><p>a bit hacky, so if someone has a better idea do speak up <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>The <strong> dhclient </strong> has such an option, as described e.g. <a href="http://eduunix.ccut.edu.cn/index2/html/unix/Absolute.OpenBSD.UNIX.For.The.Practical.Paranoid.eBook-LiB/8014final/LiB0139.html">here</a> :</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>One of dhclient(8)&#039;s more interesting features is its ability to reject bad DHCP servers. For example, some networks allow just about anyone to hook just about anything to them. If you&#039;ve ever gone to a security conference, you&#039;ve probably seen someone throw up a rogue DHCP server as a prank. If your system receives a lease from one of these servers, your connection may not work or you may be funneling all of your traffic through a packet sniffer. Nifty, no?</p><p>Ideally, you can just ask the network administrator for the correct IP address of the DHCP server. If you can&#039;t get that information, examine the leases you have received in /var/db/dhclient.leases. This file lists all the leases your system has ever received, including the bad one. Identifying a bad DHCP server is a matter of trial and error. Get the IP address of each DHCP server and then reject each server one at a time until you get a working configuration. To reject a DHCP server and refuse any further offers from it, list its IP with the &quot;reject&quot; keyword.</p><p>reject 192.168.1.84;</p></blockquote></div><p>I am sure&nbsp; <strong>udhcpc</strong> also has something like this, just cannot find it</p>									</div>

					<p>I think there is a race condition. The <strong>udhcpc</strong> returns data through environment variables. What happens if we have two DHCP events almost simultaneously? The second one will overwrite the environment variables before the first is processed.<br />I think something like this happens. In my case, there are two competing DHCP servers. One returns NAK,<br />and the other OFFER. Usually OFFER comes first, and then NAK. In this situation, the OpenWRT only sees NAK. Sometimes, NAK comes first and then OFFER. If this happens, then OpenWRT does see OFFER, so I can connect. So, sometimes I do get connection.&nbsp; But it is very unreliable. It takes many tries to get it.</p>									</div>
