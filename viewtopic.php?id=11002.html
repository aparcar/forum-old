					<p>I want to know which is the best Linksys WRT54x, or which are the main differents? There are many versions of WRT54G and then there is WRT54GS and WRT54GL. I just have bought a WRT54G V7 on which OpenWRT not works. Therefore I want to know more exactly which hardware I should now buy.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m partial to the WRT54GL.&nbsp; It just seems solid.&nbsp; Just ordered another one, in fact.&nbsp; And I have 8 others in service for various clients.</p><p>I&#039;m also working with a WRTSL54GS which is cool because of the USB, 33% faster processor, and double the flash and ram.&nbsp; But wireless range sucks for me.&nbsp; Though I&#039;ve been told by someone who has several that it should be 80-90% of what the WRT54GL can do.</p><p>I&#039;m a bit dissaapointed with the WRTSL54GS&#039;s USB fileserver performance, though.&nbsp; WIth Kamikaze and the latest 2.6.21 kernel and kernel space NFS server using 32KiB blocks, I still only get about 2.4MB/sec transfer over a 100mbit wired connection.

					<p>You can order that router online. It supports the french restrictions for the 2.4ghz range via the broadcom drivers. The ASUS has two USB 2.0 ports. The filesystem performance is due to CPU usage when copying files. I have one of these routers and I love it. I did a mod to make the antenna removable and placed a 7dbi omni on there in place of the stock one. I haven&#039;t really had a chance to test the antenna though. it&#039;s stock power output is 19 dBi (73mW) so good range is very possible with a decent external antenna.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sometime , swith chipset is integrate in the CPU as GSv3.0 (CGN5). I think performance is worst than separate chip, but i am not sure.<br />In fact, CPU are not high performance so the less they work, the more they keep performance for us. But i am not an expert so keep caution with my point of view <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p>									</div>
