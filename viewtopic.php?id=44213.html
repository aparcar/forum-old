					<p>HI,</p><p>I am trying to unbrik a TP-Link TL-WR2543ND router.</p><p>I connected USB Prolific Pl2303 on uart port of TP-Link TL-WR2543ND and i cannot read in clear characters even if serial is set-up at 115200 8n1.<br />I get only garbage. I tryed diferent baud rates, no luck.</p><p>Also i have an CP210x converter and with this one i dosent show anything.<br />Both converters are working, tested conecting TX &gt;RX i can write characters on serial.</p><p>I saw that many are using a cable from nokia, CA-42.</p><p>Is there much difference between this cable and the convertes mentioned above?</p><p>Also, sombody tryed to connect to uart port before and manage to desolder the smd near by. Seems they are ok. <br />One of them is on RX and has 1kohm and the other one is i think a pull down and has 3 kohm.</p><p>I tried with instructions from here, except i use the specified calbes above wich worked ok in other aplications.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd</a></p><p>I even soldered RX with a cable to pin from MCU, but same result.</p><p>Any advices are welcome.<br />Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>playonlcd</strong> on 15 May 2013, 00:34)</p>

					<p>also try the 10k pullup between tx and vcc of router like on mr3420?</p><p>never use vcc from adapter, only gnd tx rx <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />btw, sometimes rx do not work if you leave tx disconnected.. dunno why!</p>									</div>

					<p>lizby<br />Tried only with ground from serial port, will try from another point.<br />Reversing TX RX results in no character displayed on Teraterm</p><p>nebbia88<br />I tryed pullup resistor, nothing displayed on teraterm.</p><p>Thanks for trying!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>playonlcd</strong> on 15 May 2013, 08:59)</p>

					<p>Manage to read on serial.<br />Measured with osciloscope and the square wave was not right, was unloaded in a sine than in right line. <br />Put a rezistor between RXD and GND of the router and i can read in clear now on UART.2</p><p>PS: A SOLVED/FIXED&nbsp; button would be useful around here. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>playonlcd</strong> on 15 May 2013, 15:27)</p>

Someone gave me a Nokia DKU-5 USB/Serial console and it used to work on a Pentium Celeron running on a Debian v3.x Linux before. When I plugged this cable to my AMD64 Phenom III X2 running on an OpenSuSE 11.x, it gave garbage characters as you reported above. Then, I plugged this cable to a Pentium IV computer running on a Windows XP, it worked. Moved back to my AMD64 computer, it gives garbage characters. Unfortunately, my Pentium Celeron is now running on a newer version of Debian Linux and the Nokia DKU-5 cable gives out garbage characters. And, to make it worse, my Nokia DKU-5 cable no longer works on the Windows XP computer, i.e. garbage characters. Out of frustrations, I pulled out an old LaFonera FON2100 and use its serial port as a serial console to interface with other devices and it works. To this date, I have no idea why my Nokia DKU-5 gives me garbage characters. If you tell me what resistor you used between the RX and GND, I will be more than happy to give this a try.</p>									</div>
