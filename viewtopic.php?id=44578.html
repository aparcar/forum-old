					<p>I compiled Altitude Adjustment (r36842) recently, and found that some of my firewall rules was missing from the generated rules. Log of iptable (gotten by executing &quot;FW_TRACE=1 fw3 reload 2&gt;/tmp/iptables.log&quot;) shows something like this for both ipv4 and ipv6:<br />fw3_ipt_rule_append(): Can&#039;t find match &#039;state&#039;<br />The needed kernel module is there, but seems the corresponding iptable module was missing. I checked the menuconfig and no module for &#039;state&#039; match was listed (for trunk version, it was built-in.) So my question is how to add it? I need it for AA since recent trunk version has wireless stability issue for my WNDR3700 v1. Thanks.</p><p>Regards</p>									</div>

					<p>The state match is deprecated for a while now, you should try to replace &quot;-m state --state ...&quot; with &quot;-m conntrack --ctstate ...&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CyrusFF</strong> on 6 Jun 2013, 10:47)</p>

					<p>Thanks.<br />But why it&#039;s in trunk but not in stable version? That&#039;s quite strange for a deprecated feature, right?</p><p>Anyway, I can happily go back to AA now. Thank you again.</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks to me like you have some rules with &quot;option extra &#039;-m state ...&#039;&quot; in your /etc/config/firewall or similar. The fw3 binary itself has not a single reference to &quot;state&quot;...</p>									</div>
