					<p>I don&#039;t think that will work. </p><p>You said that these machines have fixed IPs, therefor they will not use the DHCP server to assign an ip address or DNS servers.</p><p>In windows when you set the IP address of an machine with a fixed ip, you also are supposed to set the address of the primary and optional the secondary DNS. I am not sure if this is true with other OPSYS.</p><p>You might be able to achieve both by using the static lease option, this way the machines should get the same IP every time while being serviced by the DHCP server. I would set up using the MAC addresses of the machines as this is least likely to change.</p><p>I have not tried this myself so take the advice and use with caution. If you experiment please let us know how it went.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure if I&#039;m following you here, but would it be possible to segment the hosts into different networks and use different DNS servers per-network?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how the VPN comes into it though.</p>									</div>
