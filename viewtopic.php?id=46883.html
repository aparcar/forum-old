					<p>FriedZombie,</p><p>Thanks so much for your response, yes I just noticed now that one has an extra switch on the side.</p><p>Just to fully understand.... are you saying&nbsp; &quot;there is no working version for V2 right now&quot;?</p><p>I found this on the openwrt page for MR3040....</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3040">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3040</a></p><p>It says the V2 version has already been tested since January 2013.</p><p>Is this wrong?</p><p>If there is a version V2, how do I get it?</p><p>Or is there a way to get it working on V2 somehow? </p><p>I dont really care about the extra slide switch since I will NOT ever be using it.</p><p>Thanks<br />rough</p>									</div>

					<p>Openwrt works on the mr3040v2, but not yet in the current stable release.<br />Only in the trunk release from revision R37964 and up</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3040-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3040-v2-squashfs-factory.bin</a><br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3040-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3040-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin</a></p><p>Doesn&#039;t matter if you are going to use that button or not, you still require to use the firmware for the mr3040 v2<br />Of course it is also possible to build the firmware yourself. (but you have to recompile your build with a newer version)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>FriedZombie</strong> on 21 Oct 2013, 03:24)</p>
