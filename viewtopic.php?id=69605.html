					<p>You can follow my manual concerning AirVPN, make needed modifications or bring your config file without private information <a href="https://airvpn.org/topic/20303-airvpn-configuration-on-openwrt-preventing-traffic-leakage-outside-tunnel/">https://airvpn.org/topic/20303-airvpn-c … de-tunnel/</a><br />There is also section how to block Internet access outside the tunnel.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you so much. <br />As I said I need the TP-link router to function as secondary router that will use ExpressVPN service.</p><p>The main router will be have regular internet access as it has now.</p><p>I am afraid I need to do some things first:</p><p>1. Decide wether the secondary router will function as bridge or access point.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please note that right after I flashed OpenWRT and connected&nbsp; a cable from the LAN port of the secondary router to the LAN port of my main&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />router.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I had internet access but I my gateway was the main router. In that case I couldn&#039;t access my secondary router by browser in order to get to the management console.</p><p>2. According to the&nbsp; decision on step 1&nbsp; (bridge or access point), I will like to get user guides.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>3. last step is to know how to configure ExpressVPN&nbsp; VPN on openWRT. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I have found user guide on &quot;electronicsfaq&quot;.&nbsp; I have tried to follow the steps. Please let me know if this link is reliable and has correct instructions.</p><p>Again thank you so much!<br />Sam</p>									</div>

					<ol class="decimal"><li><p>You should use your second router as AP, of course, because it performs routing. You can configure firewall on it to enable management via WAN interface.</p></li><li><p>AP, because bridge just connects two interfaces directly as switch.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.electronicsfaq.com/2016/05/configuring-your-openwrt-router-to-use.html">http://www.electronicsfaq.com/2016/05/c … o-use.html</a> It is OK, but autostart of OpenVPN connection is performed rather clumsy - see my manual. See also my manual to prevent traffic leakage outside the tunnel.</p></li></ol><p>You can also use just one router, in this case you can configure two subnets - one for direct connection, second for VPN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 30 Jan 2017, 23:29)</p>
