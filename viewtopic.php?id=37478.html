					<p>Hello,</p><p>My WR741ND usually (with the stock firmware) connects trough PPPoE for Internet connection, after the update (latest 10.03.1 with LuCI UI) I`m unable to set the router for connection. I want to use mostly the web based panel (luci), but I notice when I set the PPPoE for connection type in WAN config options, the settings for MAC cloning and MTU values disappear. This are the things I need too for setting the connection. Why this is happening, what is the idea of the firmware? Is this meaning that I`ll need to set the router trough SSH with putty or other service? If so, please provide for me the exact command lines for PPPoE setup.</p><p>When I want to access /etc/config/network with SSH I get - <br />root@OpenWrt:~# /etc/config/network<br />-ash: /etc/config/network: Permission denied<br />why is that, I have set the password. What`s the reason?</p><p>Other thing - some times on power cycle or after software reboot it`s inaccessible, only failsafe mode works. Why so?</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>
