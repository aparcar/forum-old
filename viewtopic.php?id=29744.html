					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I have started trying to get my USB hdd working with OpenWRT on my netgear wgt634u. I installed all the packages as shown on <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.essentials">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.essentials</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage</a></p><p>I am trying to use a Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 750Gb portable hdd. It requires power from the usb port. <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=430">http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=430</a> the website doesn&#039;t give much on specs, but it&#039;s so you can see exactly what drive i&#039;m using.</p><p>Originally when I would plug the drive in, it wouldn&#039;t get power. After installing the packages for USB the drive&#039;s light shows power.<br />When I plug the device in, I get the following message over and over from dmesg:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>hub 1-0:1.0: over-current change on port 1</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ve looked this message up and usually people conclude its a hardware fault, which I&#039;m hoping it isn&#039;t and here&#039;s why...</p><p>If I plug my phone in (galaxy s) it detects it fine, but I haven&#039;t managed to mount it yet. dmesg shows:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>usb 1-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4<br />usb 1-1: configuration #2 chosen from 1 choice<br />scsi2 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices<br />usb-storage: device found at 4<br />usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning<br />scsi 2:0:0:0: CD-ROM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Android&nbsp; &nbsp; UMS CD-ROM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;00 PQ: 0 ANSI: 2<br />scsi 2:0:0:1: Direct-Access&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SAMSUNG&nbsp; GT-I9000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0000 PQ: 0 ANSI: 2<br />sd 2:0:0:1: [sda] 27746240 512-byte logical blocks: (14.2 GB/13.2 GiB)<br />scsi 2:0:0:2: Direct-Access&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SAMSUNG&nbsp; GT-I9000 Card&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PQ: 0 ANSI: 2<br />sd 2:0:0:1: [sda] Write Protect is off<br />sd 2:0:0:1: [sda] Mode Sense: 03 00 00 00<br />sd 2:0:0:1: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />sd 2:0:0:2: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk<br />usb-storage: device scan complete<br />sd 2:0:0:1: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br /> sda:<br />sd 2:0:0:1: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />sd 2:0:0:1: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk</p></blockquote></div><p>I also tried a 2Gb SanDisk usb stick:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>usb 1-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 5<br />usb 1-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice<br />scsi3 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices<br />usb-storage: device found at 5<br />usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning<br />scsi 3:0:0:0: Direct-Access&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SanDisk&nbsp; Cruzer Colors+&nbsp; &nbsp;8.02 PQ: 0 ANSI: 0 CCS<br />sd 3:0:0:0: [sda] 3907583 512-byte logical blocks: (2.00 GB/1.86 GiB)<br />sd 3:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off<br />sd 3:0:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 45 00 00 08<br />sd 3:0:0:0: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />usb-storage: device scan complete<br />sd 3:0:0:0: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br /> sda: sda1 sda2<br />sd 3:0:0:0: [sda] Assuming drive cache: write through<br />sd 3:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk</p></blockquote></div><p>And I&#039;m able to mount the usb stick using mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb</p><p>The WD HDD works fine under Windows on numerous devices, it also works plugged into my Wii so I figure there&#039;s nothing wrong with the WD drive. The only other thing with the WD drive I have thought might be a problem is that it has some sort of partition on it that contains the WD SmartWare software on it, which usually starts up when plugged into a windows machine. I can&#039;t see it being a problem really as linux would just treat it as a partition and nothing would execute from it anyway.</p><p>Any other ideas? Maybe the WD drive is not compatible with the netgear or openwrt?</p>									</div>

Your Windows and Wii devices are capable of providing the necessary power to the USB bus, but the WGT634U is not.</p><p>If you can find a <em>powered</em> USB hub - a hub which has its own power supply - it will probably provide enough power to make your WD drive work with the router. Otherwise, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re going to get this drive attached to the router.</p><p>This is a pretty good explanation of USB power limits: <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/243936-32-your-device-exceeded-power-limits">Your USB device has exceeded the power limits...</a></p>									</div>
