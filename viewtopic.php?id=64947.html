					<p>I currently am using an Asus RT-N56U and it has been doing a decen job for me.&nbsp; I have been using Padavan&#039;s custom firmware and that coupled with a very long IPtables script provides some policy based routing for me based on IP address.</p><p>Recently I have been having some weird behavior, and before looking into a new router I wanted to try some new firmware.&nbsp; I was hoping that my next router would have some easy routing options for openvpn.&nbsp; I have seen some on other firmwares but OpenWRT seems to have the best compatibility and so far, the easiest place to navigate.</p><p>How difficult is it to perform IP based routing in OperWRT 15.05 (or higher)?&nbsp; Currently I have x.x.x.1 - x.x.x.100 going through VPN, while everything above .100 goes through my WAN.</p><p>Thanks for your time! I Hope that all made sense</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I struggled with the same problem.</p><p>The solution was:</p><p>Create an up and down script, which are involved by the OpenVPN process:</p><p>Add <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  
route-nopull
route-noexec
up /etc/openvpn/cg/up-script.sh
down /etc/openvpn/cg/down-script.sh</code></pre></div><p>to your openvpn.conf. <br />Eventually delete other &quot;route-pull&quot; commands. </p><p>Up script:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  
#!/bin/sh
ip rule add from 192.168.1.128/25 priority 10 table vpn
ip route add 192.168.1.128/25 dev tun1 table vpn
ip route add default via $ifconfig_remote dev tun1 table vpn
ip route flush cache</code></pre></div><p>Down script:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  
#!/bin/sh
rm /etc/openvpn/cg/up
touch /etc/openvpn/cg/down
ip rule del from 192.168.1.128/25</code></pre></div><p>When the OpenVPN tunnel comes up, the up-script is executed and traffic from 192.168.1.128-255 will be routed through the VPN.<br />When the tunnel goes down, this route will be deleted.</p><p>Hope, it helps.</p>									</div>
