					<p>I&#039;m sure this has been documented in a number of threads, but I must be using the wrong terminology in my searches.</p><p>Let&#039;s say I have a single LAN that gives Internet access to its clients.&nbsp; What I would like to accomplish is this:<br />when a user connects to the LAN and gets assigned an IP, I want all of their traffic to redirect to a &quot;login/registration&quot; page before being allowed to access the Internet.</p><p>Basically, I want to do what hotels do, where a client opens a web browser, and they are redirected to an internal page until they enter, for example, a room number and a last name.</p><p>In reality, my setup will be much simpler, but it&#039;s more or less the same idea.</p><p>To start, I was trying to set up some iptables rules to redirect a particular client to an internal web page.</p><p>Here is my first attempt at the &quot;/etc/firewall.user&quot; rules:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m --mac-source xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.1:81

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -m --mac-source xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -p tcp ! --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.1:82

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -m mac --mac-source xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -j MASQUERADE</code></pre></div><p>This works to some extent.&nbsp; While these rules are in effect, the mac address in question is redirected to my internal web page.&nbsp; For http traffic, it works a treat.&nbsp; For https traffic, the user is directed to the https port for my internal page, which prompts them that the certificates do not match.</p><p>This is why I bring up the hotel example.&nbsp; How do they manage to redirect all traffic to an internal page without doing masquerading.&nbsp; I have read that you have to use DNAT (as opposed to REDIRECT) to redirect external requests to a local address, but I don&#039;t want to do masquerading.&nbsp; I&#039;d simply like to redirect all requests, http or https, to the internal page.&nbsp; Initially, I was not using MASQUERADE, and I seem to recall that the https redirects were not working at all.&nbsp; Now they do, but obviously the browser thinks that it is still on the original page and indicates that the certificate is untrusted.</p><p>I will test further without MASQUERADE when I get home, but I was surprised I couldn&#039;t find more information on accomplishing this commonly-employed mechanism in OpenWrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 24 Aug 2015, 22:15)</p>

					<p>Is it the case that I need to add a POSTROUTING SNAT rule as opposed to the MASQUERADE?&nbsp; I actually don&#039;t want masquerading, and I should not be changing protocols on the majority of browser traffic, because I am only directing port 80 (http) to my http port (81).&nbsp; All other browser traffic should be directed to my https port (82).</p><p>Initially, my https rule only redirected 443, but Google searches via iPhone were bypassing the rule entirely, so I adopted using &quot;! --dport 80&quot;, which I do realize is not a good assumption to make, although it does succeed at redirecting Dr. Google.</p><p>How is it exactly that hotel routers are able to redirect all traffic to an internal page so transparently?&nbsp; Am I going about this all wrong?</p><p>I do not want to use NoDogSplash, as I&#039;d prefer to be able to manage the firewall myself, but I am open to using OpenWrt firewall configuration (as documented here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#dnatsnat_redirects_and_forwarding_combination">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewal … ombination</a>) rather than my creating my own iptables rules if that is a better approach.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 24 Aug 2015, 23:27)</p>

					<p>Clever suggestion on the Nodogsplash GitHub:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash/issues/3#issuecomment-67356684">https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogspl … t-67356684</a></p><p>The suggestion is to send https traffic to a 302 redirect, which redirects to http, (potentially) bypassing the bad certificate warning and (definitely) changing protocol for me automatically.&nbsp; Sounds like it&#039;s worth a try for sure...&nbsp; I am surprised to hear that Nodogsplash does not support redirecting https to the splash page.&nbsp; I thought this was standard in captive portals, but maybe I just haven&#039;t been paying enough attention.</p><p>Actually, further Googling suggests that this will not bypass the invalid certificate warning.&nbsp; It basically just replicates the scenario I&#039;m already in with the invalid certificate for my captive login page.</p><p>So, in my case, I have do have physical access to all of my clients.&nbsp; Can I just install a self-signed trusted CA certificate on each client and use something like SSLsplit (<a href="https://www.roe.ch/SSLsplit">https://www.roe.ch/SSLsplit</a>) to forge certificates on the fly using my trusted CA private key, then forward the requests via the SSLsplit proxy specification to my local address?</p><p>Seems like it should work, in theory.&nbsp; I only have 4 client devices that this will apply to, so trusting the self-signed CA cert is not a big hurdle for me.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like I just use this forum to talk myself through these problems.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fecaleagle</strong> on 25 Aug 2015, 01:03)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m trying for weeks to get nodogsplash working.&nbsp; I only need a simple capture and redirect to a custom page that i host on a USB.&nbsp; So Coova and wifidog seem to be overhead and even more complex to configure, thats why I picked nodog... But even that is enough to put me on the wrong foot.</p><p>If anyone can help me in this tread to join this tread:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59128">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=59128</a><br />That would be very nice.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve seen several unanswered posts about nodogsplash and I hope I can help a few people just by walking trough the inner workings of nodogsplash.&nbsp; What i don&#039;t understand is how it actually captures traffic. It&#039;s mostlikely 1 simple thing that i&#039;m not being able to see yet.</p>									</div>
