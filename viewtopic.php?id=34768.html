					<p>I am running ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (bleeding edge, r30133) on a BT Home Hub and I know that it is just that - bleeding edge.</p><p>My problem is getting wget working. I wish to use https for ddns updates and also to fetch files from secure servers so can&#039;t just use the one in busybox.</p><p>I have used opkg to install wget and openssl-utils and followed the wiki to get a couple of CA certificates in so I can access the sites I want.</p><p>Everything runs fine until I reboot the router, at which point wget fails with a segmentation fault. To recover I have to opkg remove wget and then I can use the busybox one.</p><p>Any ideas how I work out what is happening - is it a hardware fault, configuration or a problem with the firmware (thanks to btsimonh for doing that bit)</p>									</div>

					<p>Even without CA, you could use &quot;--no-check-certificate&quot;. Of corse, this does not prevent from a &quot;Man in the middle attack&quot;.</p><p>Check the files that wget and openssl-utils adds to see what is breaking your router. Install only openssl-utils and reboot to see if the problem is with it (it might be).</p><p>Check with ldd which libraries the problem program is using before and after the reboot. i.e.:</p><p>root@router:~# ldd /usr/bin/wget <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; libcrypt.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libcrypt.so.0 (0x2aabe000)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; libm.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libm.so.0 (0x2aae2000)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; libc.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.0 (0x2ab0b000)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ld-uClibc.so.0 =&gt; /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 (0x2aaa8000)</p><p>Regards,</p>									</div>

					<p>Took a while - had to buy some new hardware as I killed the one I was working on <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Now have it working.
