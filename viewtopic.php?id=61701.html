					<p>I believe this is the best way.</p><p>The DVR is connected to the main router by ethernet.

But the USB adapter doesn&#039;t work well due to poor signal strength, so the DVR software is sensitive to dropped packets, and so I prefer using the other router for that and other reasons.<br />I&#039;m trying to figure out how set up a static route, on which router do I create the static route, and using luci, what does the interface, target, IPv4 netmask, IPv4 Gateway, and metric options mean?</p><p>Is there a good guide on static routing?</p><p>Many things on static routing are generic or outdated, and it&#039;s hard to find OpenWRT specific guides.</p>									</div>

					<p>You probably only need a static route on the main router that tells it how to reach the Desktop and other devices on the same network. And make sure to disable NAT in the other router otherwise a static route doesn&#039;t make much sense.</p><p>Target and netmask is for the network to which the Desktop is connected (openwrt default is 192.168.0.0 and 255.255.255.0 just to give an example). The interface is the one connected to the other router, and the gateway is the IP address of the other router. Metric isn&#039;t needed if you have only one route.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikma</strong> on 23 Dec 2015, 01:05)</p>

					<p>OK, so you need to enable WDS in /etc/config/wireless for the SSID on the router acting as master on the wireless network.</p><p>Then on the other unit, connect it to the wireless station mode, as you have done already, and bridge wlan to lan, then make sure dnsmasq and firewall are disabled (chmod -x /etc/init.d/firewall and dnsmasq), reboot and all should be good <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Correct, so those services don&#039;t start at boot. Likewise you could use image generator to create a custom firmware without those packages:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obta â€¦ e.generate</a></p>									</div>
