					<p>Hi,</p><p>Has anyone tried to port LocustWorld to run on OpenWRT. I wouldn&#039;t mind having a go, but I thought I&#039;d ask around first incase I was either going to re-invent the wheel, or flog a dead horse!</p><p>I&#039;ve messed around with OLSR quite a bit and have had a working mesh going, but there are quite a few LocustWorld nodes around my city and if I can get it working on a WRT54G for a lot cheaper(~Â£100 with decent ariel) than the standard LocustWorld mesh box (Â£250) I think it&#039;d help it take off even more.</p><p>I know there are some good arguments against LocustWorld, reliance on Wiana for example, but it does seem to be a very good plug and play mesh system.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Darren.</p>									</div>
