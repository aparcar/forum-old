					<p>Based on my needs, I had to find a solution to make the router change the wireless network if it went down, by itself.<br />After some work (I&#039;m kinda nooby with linux scripting), I got this script.<br />It&#039;s been growing slowly with the help of the users in the forum, actually it works very well. <br />Many thanks to them!</p><p>Requisites:<br /> - Openwrt installed, will not work on DDWRT!<br /> -&nbsp; Enable and configure wifi as client, set it to WAN:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set wireless.@wifi-iface[0].disabled=0

					<p>Yes, if none of them are available it would loop until it finds any.<br />The repeater mode got that limitation. If the client network can&#039;t connect , the AP network breaks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Could this be easily adjusted, to provide auto-scan / auto-connection to ANY open / known network?</p><p>At least so far as I can tell, that seems to be the major difference between this and other AAP type scripts...&nbsp; With this one, it seems you&#039;ve got to enter each of the permitted networks into the configs.&nbsp; With others, you can enter known closed networks or auto-connect to any open ones, and quite seamlessly...</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, dabyd64,</p><p>First,thanks so much for your script,still have some questions.</p><p>1.Can it be used in backfire 10.3.1?<br />2.Suppose,booted the router, then successfully connected to&nbsp; &quot;COFEE1&quot; and after some while &quot;COFEE1&quot; shutdown,what will happen with your script? I used autoap in dd-wrt for Broadcom, it will auto connect to the next one, in your example &quot;DSLrouter&quot;,if &quot;COFFE1&quot; a.SHUT DOWN b.Changed password c. no internet connectivity, and it goes on the white list, can set the ping time for google.com,say each 1 minute, sure if it&#039;s OK,then no disturbing with the connection with the &quot;COFFE1&quot;,if not OK, then try connecting to &quot;DSLrouter&quot;,and on and on...<br />3. What shall be added in the script for initialising the MacChanger.ipk each booting of the router.</p><p>Thanks again for the script, I am still figuring out orange&#039;s AAP, he just seldom shows up. Before I learn to compile and upgrade to Attitude Adjustment with my tp-link 840n v1,I may need your script to run on backfire already flashed.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

No idea about Broadcom or Ralink devices.</p><br /><p><span style="color: red"><strong>2</strong></span><br />The script does ping Google every 30 seconds.<br />If suddenly the connection is lost, it detects that condition, it makes a wireless survey, then it searches the availability of the pre-configured networks inside &quot;wlist&quot; file.<br />It configures the first wifi network available that it finds inside of the wlist file.<br />After applying the new config, it wait 10 seconds, then it pings Google again.<br />If it got response, it returns to the main loop (checking the network status periodically).<br />If it didn&#039;t, it will discard that network and jump to the next in the list and try again.</p><p>If you are connected to &quot;COFFEE1&quot; and it powers off, it will detect that it not longer has connectivity.<br />Then it will scan for the wireless networks available and, check if &quot;COFFEE1&quot; exists,<br />As it will not appear, it will check the next network, &quot;DSLrouter&quot;. If it exists, it will set the ssid, security and key, as set on the wlist file.<br />If COFFEE1 reappears, it will not do anything to check if it exists, unless the wireless drops again.</p><p>If the wireless network changes it&#039;s name, then it will be treated like a different network, so the router will not see it again unless the wlist file is re-configured.<br />If it changes the security... No problem, remember: After changing the network, it waits 10 seconds, then sends a few pings to Google.<br />If it got no response, it will discard the changes and continue searching the next wireless network available, until it finds a network that is available and also has internet.</p><p>My knowledge in linux scripting is like the worst of any of you.<br />I did this by searching and learning a bit on google!<br />If anyone with more knowledge wants to make it better, (s)he&#039;s free to do that.<br />But I don&#039;t know how to do , and I won&#039;t spend hours on searching how make blacklist/whitelist, key change detection, or anything else.<br />That would end in a mess.<br />This was a personal need, I shared here for everyone because it worked well for me , but don&#039;t expect much more <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" /></p><br /><br /><p><span style="color: red"><strong>3</strong></span><br />After installing macchanger, add the macchanger command after the main loop, as this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>macchanger wlan0  -r
while [ &quot;1&quot; ]; do
        NetStatus
        sleep 15
done</code></pre></div><p>Then it will set the mac randomly each boot</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 18 Aug 2013, 05:12)</p>

					<p>Hi, dabyd64, </p><p>Thanks so much for your quick response and the scripts,your time and efforts.</p><p> I will test it and report to you.</p><p>One thing is that the script use essid to detect rather than bssid, some users just too lazy that after scan there are several &quot;MyBuffalo&quot;,&quot;MyNetgear&quot;, then I don&#039;t know what will the script does.My suggestion is that by combining these two, essid+bssid, that is setting them both in the white list, that every wireless signal is UNIQUE, can connect to them as in the prefered order.Sure, if they change either the essid or bssid, the script will treat them as different routers.</p><p>I am good at designing websites, some ERP programming, but worse than you at the scripting.</p><p>And I am learning further how to develop a gui web, just put an addtional tab on the LUCI web interface &quot;autoplay&quot;, with autoap, aircrack, reaver,MDK3 and screen, just input the essid&amp;bssid in the input text field, radio button, check box,etc.</p><p>Choose it in two modes&quot;Learning mode&quot; or &quot;connecting Mode&quot;, auto reaver from the strongest &quot;pinnable“ signal and keep the log once deadlocked or finish and then reaver the next until final. Or simply auto connect in the prefered list.</p><p>Seems a long road to go, first have to master PHP or something similar.</p><p>Thanks, I will test it first.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://royalwin.c.blog.so-net.ne.jp/_images/blog/_f78/royalwin/image/2012-07-02T00:50:37-d44b8.jpg?c=a0" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://royalwin.c.blog.so-net.ne.jp/_images/blog/_f78/royalwin/image/2012-07-02T00:50:41-03935.jpg?c=a1" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>That sounds interesting! I have zero knowledge about PHP... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" /></p><p>Yes, I thought on searching for the BSSID, but I don&#039;t know how to parse the &quot;iw scan&quot; output to ensure that both ssid and bssid are from the same network...unless you suppose that if &quot;x&quot; bssid and &quot;y&quot; ssid appear, they are from the same network.<br />If there are a few networks with the same name, &quot;WIFI&quot; and the configured the network &quot;WIFI&quot; with bssid &quot;00:11:22:33:44:55&quot; changes its name to &quot;WIFI2&quot;, the iw scan will show &quot;WIFI&quot; and &quot;WIFI2&quot; ssids.<br />With a simple grep the script will think that the network still exists.<br />¿How to ensure that it won&#039;t happen?<br />Starting by adding a new variable inside the wlist file, called net(x)_bssid=&quot;00:11:22:33:44:55&quot;.<br />Then, running <strong>iw wlan0 scan | grep -e &quot;BSS &quot; -e &quot;SSID: &quot;</strong> will show something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>BSS 00:18:46:73:04:52 (on wlan0)
        SSID: WIRELESS
BSS 00:14:25:D9:b1:3C (on wlan0)
        SSID: HOME
                 * OBSS non-GF present: 0
BSS 00:91:52:32:c2:20 (on wlan0)
        SSID: WLAN
BSS 00:22:3f:11:32:22 (on wlan0)
        SSID: WIFI1</code></pre></div><p>Nice. Now I have to ensure that, for example, &quot;00:18:46:73:04:52 &quot; and WIRELESS are next each other, meaning that they belong to the same wireless network.<br />But, how to do that?<br />With that solved, the script would be finished!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 19 Aug 2013, 02:06)</p>

					<p>Hi, dabyd64,</p><p>I have tested it on backfire, doesn&#039;t work.Maybe it works, it is that I did&#039;t configure it right.</p><p>And updated to AA, first repeat my another router, make sure everything works right.</p><p>Then win scp the scripts,reboot.</p><p>And turned off my router that was repeated, and it didn&#039;t connect to the next one on the white list.</p><p>Maybe my there&#039;s sth wrong with my configs?</p><p>1. why there is no rc.common in&nbsp; /etc/wifiMgr.sh?<br />2. if there should be a space after c in &quot;net=$(ping google.es -c5 |grep &quot;time=&quot;)&quot;? changed to &quot;net=$(ping yahoo.com -c 5 |grep &quot;time=&quot;) and another same line too.</p><p>Can you put an example of PSK2 encryption? all I can see is:<br />1 wep<br />2 wep with shared key<br />3 wpa-psk<br />4 wpa2-psk<br />5 wpa-psk/wpa2-psk mixed mode</p><p>what for these 5 accordingly?
