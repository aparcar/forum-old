In later routers upgrading using the Linksys web update page has been low risk.&nbsp; But you should identify your version first.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks gr8w11ne! I found out that it&#039;s actually a LinkSys BEFW11S4 version 2&nbsp; 802.11b AP.</p><p>I&#039;m assuming since this model is not on the OpenWRT hardware list, it&#039;s probably never been tested before.</p>									</div>
