					<p>David</p><p>Lantis (over on the Gargoyle website) has very kindly provided me with a copy of gargoyle for my WRT1900ACS with the iptables-ndpi package included. It works well in that it blocks a whole load of websites/apps (like layer 7 should) but it has made my router unstable and it randomly reboots every day or two. I see there was a version of the package compiled for CC but not for LEDE or the latest OpenWRT snapshot. Is there any chance of adding this as an available package to download to try with your LEDE snapshot to see if it runs stably under LEDE&nbsp; as its a really useful package with kids in the house ?<br />Thanks<br />Roger.</p>									</div>

I know in my case, between 5pm and 10pm, the best I can do on the 3200acm/1900acs is around 50mbps/50mbps... However around midnight it goes above 100-200mbps up/down, and early in the morning 6am I can pull maximum bandwidth, which in my case is 300mbps/300mbps.</p><p>Through the day, the noise level continues to increase and peaks around 7pm to which I get the worst performance, even if I&#039;m right next to the antennas. </p><p>Also, the Lede image includes iperf, so can you install iperf on your laptop/device and run some throughput tests on 2.4 and 5Ghz?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidc502</strong> on 22 May 2017, 01:00)</p>

					<p>I have actually had all of those, settings and all. Except that I&#039;m connected to my<br />other network as a client, but I still get the same results if I&#039;m not. Same channel too (or close to it) maybe I really have gotten a dud. But mines is v2 and yours is v1. How does your 1200ac perform?</p><p>The only thing I can think of is the placement of my router which is VERY congested on the 2.4 band (but 5g is still meh?) and my N150 was in the same spot so I dropped that theory.</p>									</div>

					<p>And I actually am on official LEDE on an older build. I don&#039;t know what the problem is but all of the newer builds seem to have this problem where the requests process very slowly (YouTube takes longer to load and such) and it&#039;s VERY noticeable. Ugh I really need to get to a computer. Too bad there&#039;s no mobile optimized version for this site.</p>									</div>
