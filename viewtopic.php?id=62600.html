					<p>Hi, I have not been compiling for a while, last with BB, but the last tp link wr841n I bought came as v10, so I needed to go for CC and I found can&#039;t compile basic configuration plus wget (I need full wget with ssl support, not the trimmed busybox one). Last time I needed this for V8, with BB it compiled fine and &quot;plenty of&quot; space still remained, but with CC and wget checked, the image is not created at all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m either doing something wrong, or there&#039;s something very space hungry on CC. I don&#039;t need ipv6 support, I&#039;d get rid of it, if I&#039;d know how, but with trunk there should be no luci (or is there?), which have always been the biggest space eater.</p><p>Btw. I even desperatedly made distclean, and even rm -rf openwrt (and downloaded everything again from git) to eliminate unclean build, so the build should be clean. But images for wr841n are not created.</p><p>This what I did: get openwrt git, script feeds update &amp; install, make menuconfig - checked wr841n profile, checked atheros driver to respect regdomain set, checked network - file transfer - wget and mail - mailsend-nossl (which is small and does not depend on openssl). Any ideas? Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you. Really? It makes all touse&nbsp; fine and cheap tp link devices like wr841n useless. It really sucks, because I have openwrt on about 50 wr841n routers :-( Is there something what can be removed (even from kernel, like ipv6), or the kernel is just too big and nothing can be done? I need extra parameters for wget and openssl too (site I need to interact with is https only).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 7 Feb 2016, 15:19)</p>

					<p>The ppp and ppp-mod-pppoe packages are included by default in most profiles, you can save 100k on those (and ~20k on the corresponding kernel modules).</p><p>Have you attempted to backport uclient-fetch from latest trunk, to see if it can do what you need? It has recently replaced busybox-wget in trunk, and can use any of OpenSSL, PolarSSL, MbedTLS or CyaSSL/WolfSSL for HTTPS support (strictly speaking it uses ustream-ssl, which in turn can use any of the mentioned implementations). With PolarSSL or MbedTLS, uclient-fetch and your chosen crypto library should fit in below 250k based on the relevant package sizes on downloads.openwrt.org. Libopenssl is larger than 700k on its own, add wget at ~170k and it&#039;s a massive difference.</p>									</div>

					<p>nozombian, I guess you are aware of the image builder, and that you make a full build instead for a good reason. Otherwise the image builder should be pretty good for making a small custom image.</p>									</div>

					<p>Makro, stas2z, hnyman, thank you for valuable replies!</p><p>The time has passed so quickly I found it hard to believe that I&#039;m in fact two releases behind :-) To my big surprise I&#039;m actually using DD, which is in the trunk. I nearly always used the trunk, because luci was not there and I was not able to get rid of it from the &quot;stable&quot; release. I like vi and command line, but that does not make a guru. After like 4 years with openwrt I have finally learned how to find and untick dependencies! Formerly I have used backups of the .config file to &quot;untick&quot; ;-)</p><p>Btw. Uclient-fetch (with mbedtls I think) is working perfectly for me with https site, wget too, extept user agent faking, whcih I don&#039;t mind at the moment. Also I have not seen parameter for cooties, which I don&#039;t need for this project, so I don&#039;t mind too. Good to know there is this handy little https aware alternative. Formerly I used curl, which is much better than wget, but it was very space hungry.</p><p>zo0ok, I have tried imagebuilder once, but something was not working for me and I had no time to find why, so my good reason I&#039;m using the normal process is that I&#039;m simply used to it and it always worked for me.</p><p>bolvan, Luci is a girl from the next door, otherwise I could not agree more ;-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 8 Feb 2016, 00:23)</p>
