					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;ve got a TL-WR802N (A TP-Link &quot;Nano Router), flashed OpenWRT on it, originally for another purpose, but want to use the device now just as a wifi client, which connect&#039;s a lan wired device to my wifi network (So that the device is accessible from the other devices in my wifi network).At the moment, I&#039;m only familiar with the LuCI Web configuration Interface, so perhaps, you can recommend me a simple solution for that, without setting static routings on my original wifi network router (With the original firmware of the nano router, as far as i remember, this had been possible). Perhaps the easiest solution would be, that the wifi client just pulls an IP Adress via DHCP, and forwards all the traffic in both directions to the lan wire.</p><p>Thanks for help in advance</p><p>Best regards</p><p>Daniel</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Masiwo</strong> on 23 Aug 2016, 08:28)</p>

					<p>Well, I must admit, that I really don&#039;t get along with those tutorials. I also tried to try them out yesterday, but nearly broke the device, because I can&#039;t reset it, cause the hardware reset button is not working -&gt; I rather stick to the Web Interface where I hopefully can&#039;t break everything. In the LuCI Interface I normally go to Network -&gt; Wifi -&gt; Scan -&gt; Add my Network as a &quot;Client&quot;, attach it to wwan, so my device gets internet connection. So this works, as well as visiting local network urls of the other devices in the wifi network. But that does not work in the other directon (How should it, I get assigned a 192.168.1.219 IP adress...). Is there a simple solution, to, well unify the wlan client and the lan connected client?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Masiwo</strong> on 23 Aug 2016, 10:36)</p>

					<p>Ha ha ha... But well, perhaps I can make myself a bit more clear. I want my little tp link router which I use as the wifi client accessable from the other clients of the wifi network he is connected to, WITHOUT changing anything on the AccessPoint which offers the wifi. Afaik ther&#039;s not tutorial covering that, so I&#039;d like to ask for a solution. I think this should be possible.</p><p>Best regards</p><p>Daniel</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello again,</p><p>so, I now googled a bit around, and figured out, that the bridge would be able through this &quot;Client WDS&quot; Mode. Unfortunateley, my main router is a netgear one, and I absoluteley don&#039;t want to flash OpenWRT on it. Could you perhaps give me some keywords to search for, how I can achieve this without a second OpenWRT Router where I can enable the AccessPoint WDS ?</p><p>Best regards </p><p>Daniel</p>									</div>
