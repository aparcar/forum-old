					<p>I have been going through the process of building OpenWRT myself for my wndr3800.&nbsp; I have added Luci to the build instead of as a module.&nbsp; My problem is that I can&#039;t seem to find out how to have uhttpd enabled by default.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>
