					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I am trying to set up my /etc/config/wireless with disable_dgaf, but it seems that UCI doesn&#039;t support this option for now?<br />I tried to hack the hostapd.sh to output disable_dgaf=1 in hostapd.conf generated by netifd, but my hostapd failed to run. It says in the log file that disable_dgaf command is not recognized.</p><p>I am using OpenWrt Chaos Calmers on my system so the hostapd version is 2.5-devel. And I am using WPA-PSK2 Personal encryption.</p><p>Could anyone help me with a hostapd version that has disable_dgaf? AFAIK, this is enabled when the binary is compiled with the option for Hotspot 2.0. I am assuming the default hostapd wasn&#039;t built with this option?</p><p>Thank you all!</p>									</div>

					<p>I have found the answer to this problem. <br />1) Basically I rebuilt the hostapd package by downloading the source code from OpenWrt GitHub.<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/</a><br />I took the Chaos Calmer branch.</p><p>2) Then I just followed the instructions to build just one package from here:<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howtobuild/single.package">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howtobuild/single.package</a></p><p>3) Then I made sure that all the dependencies are followed for hostapd. Please refer to the Makefile:<br /><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob/chaos_calmer/package/network/services/hostapd/Makefile">https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob â€¦ d/Makefile</a></p><p>PKG_CONFIG_DEPENDS:= \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_WPA_SUPPLICANT_NO_TIMESTAMP_CHECK \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-ath9k \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-cfg80211 \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_hostapd \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_hostapd-mini \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-hostap \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_WPA_RFKILL_SUPPORT \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_DRIVER_WEXT_SUPPORT \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIG_DRIVER_11N_SUPPORT</p><p>Make sure that all of these are enabled in &quot;make menuconfig&quot; or just edit &quot;.config&quot; file directly.<br />Basically after all the setup we type: &quot;make package/hostapd/compile&quot;. And we&#039;ll get the required .ipk.</p>									</div>
