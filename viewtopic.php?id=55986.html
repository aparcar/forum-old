					<p>Hi, new to OpenWrt and so far have found my way&nbsp; around it very easily. But, I am stalled with the USB-Flash drive in the router.</p><p>I have a HooToo TravelMate Nano and installed OpenWrt from a thread here. It was a breeze. Followed the step-by-step and instant success. Thanks to all who had a hand in that, with a special thanks to Wingspinner.<br />Firmware Version&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenWrt Chaos Calmer r42649 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r10532)<br />Kernel Version&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.14.18 </p><p>When I go to the System/Mount Points and click &quot;Add&quot; I am not sure what to enter other than the /dev/sda</p><p>I know very little about Linux and just try to puddle my through before bothering people here, but I need help. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I did a search of the wiki and found two items, one showed a very out of date screen shots and no help, the other wast at the coal face with scripts.</p><p>I have set up what I think it needs and then used \\192.126.0.98 (bridged router IP) as I have done with other routers but windows spits it back with can&#039;t connect.</p><p>So, how do I share this USB drive with the win8.1 network? </p><p>p.s. Just found that win8.1 is reporting that the device &quot;actively refused the connection.&quot; Is that any help?<br />Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MyNewRouter</strong> on 26 Feb 2015, 22:27)</p>

					<p>Thanks, but one of those is the script stuff that I have already looked at and mentioned and I have no idea how to go about. </p><p>The other link is also along the same lines. Please note that I said, I know nothing about Linux. I don&#039;t want to have to learn Linux just to add &quot;Share&quot; component to the already recognized USB drive.</p><p>Given that OpenWrt identifies and Adds the thumb drive on it&#039;s own, it seems to me that the rest of it should also be a point and click thing.</p><p>The software those links say are needed are all installed according to the list under System/Software.</p><p>When I try to use the &quot;Download package and install&quot; option for &quot;kmod-fs-ntfs&quot; I get </p><p>Collected errors:<br /> * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package kmod-fs-ntfs.</p><p>I need some help on specifics as to how to fix this.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MyNewRouter</strong> on 26 Feb 2015, 23:34)</p>

					<p>When you use a trunk build, the packages (especially kernel ones) on the OpenWrt server become out of date every day with the publishing of a new build.&nbsp; You will need to upgrade to the latest build and also download and save the ImageBuilder-- which has a copy of all the packages so you can install them from your local copy later.</p><p>kmod-fs-ntfs provides read-only access.&nbsp; You need ntfs-3g to read and write an NTFS disk.&nbsp; It would be better to format the disk to something other than NTFS.&nbsp; Accessing NTFS on Linux is slow especially with a router that has a slow CPU.</p><p>/dev/sda is connected to the whole disk.&nbsp; You can&#039;t mount that as a filesystem.&nbsp; The filesystem(s) on the disk are in the partitions.&nbsp; /dev/sda1 would be the first and often only one.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks MK24, but you don&#039;t seem to understand, or didn&#039;t read my original post. I do not want to have to learn Linux just to activate the USB drive.</p><p>Saying I need to update without telling me or giving me a link on specifically what to do, I am going to skip it as too hard.</p><p>If people want Linux, OpenWrt, etc to get better mainstream use and ideally be a threat to windows, then this stuff has got to be made easier for the non-Linux users.</p><p>Sooo, the upshot of my short journey here is that I will drop OpenWrt from the router and re-image it with the original OEM crap. The linking to the USB drive and mapping it is as simple as plugging it in. I have to do nothing other than wait about 5-seconds and windows can see it.</p><p>The irritating part about this is that the underlying OS of the router interface IS Linux.</p><p>Look, I would love Linux to become the reigning OS, but as long as the mindset of current Linux users changes, it is going to stay in the 6% range forever.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MyNewRouter</strong> on 27 Feb 2015, 16:52)</p>
