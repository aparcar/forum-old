					<p>They were playing nice. Up until today. </p><p>Something happened this morning (power failure on the router) and the ping from the laptop is just totally missing - no answer at all for minute or three and then the connectivity is back for some 10-15 seconds. It&#039;s really maddening.</p><p>I tried everything a common user like me can do - starting from restarts. Googled a lot. No luck.</p><p>Affected is only wifi connectivity to laptop. The cable connectivity to pc and wifi connectivity to phones is ok.</p><p>I hate to be bothersome for people around but I really can&#039;t deal with this issue on my own.</p><p>Why am I writing this here - when I disconnect the WAN (at some time I wondered if somebody ddosed my router) and after router reboot the wifi is just fine - no problem at all. Tested for couple of hours and wifi was ok but got no internet. Then I connected the wan again and the problem reappered. Tried to disconnect wan cable - the problem was still there. Rebooted the router with no wan - wifi is ok.</p><p>Laptop was not powered to power socket at the time of the power failure. Could it be harm in the router?</p><p>These two buddies were best friends until this morning. Tried everything, googled everything i thought of, but still can&#039;t figure what&#039;s happening.</p><p>Guys, any idea is appreciated.</p><p>p.s. 1043 is v1.7<br />laptop wifi is intel 5100 agn</p>									</div>
