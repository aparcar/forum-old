					<p>oh boy do i have a fun problem. i had a fresh install of 8.09 going and i was in the web based manager. i changed some setting to DHCP from static and then ... it broke. i cant ping it, cant anything to it, nothing. however, when i set up a continuous ping to the 192.168.1.1 IP addy it will request time out, i unplug the power, it goes to &quot;hardware error&quot; then i plug the wire in it goes to &quot;reply from 192.168.1.1 bytes=32&quot; for 3 or 4 replies then goes back to timing out.</p><p>I have to get this thing back up and running.</p><p>UPDATE:</p><p>So i figure i would try the same thing, only from my *nix box. After an nmap i saw 23 was open, so i telnet into it. It gave me the usual &quot;passwd will change the password and disable telnet and enable SSH&quot;, etc. So i ran that, and it tells me &quot;passwd: cannot update password file /etc/passwd&quot;.</p><p>After some other investigation, it appears whenever i open a file in vi, its &quot;read only.&quot; Even though the files are owned by root and are set to rw-r-----.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ptchinster</strong> on 23 Apr 2009, 02:56)</p>
