					<p>@kofec haven&#039;t heard of that, well, will at least have a look, thanks<br />@gazambuja I will check this firmware and report back. So far on OpenWRT trunk I see that 5G works well, but I know that 2.4G works really bad (my laptop reconnects every few minutes even though I&#039;m sitting 3 meters away from router with direct visibility). I&#039;ll try LEDE to see what&#039;s the situation there, but I doubt I&#039;ll see any difference regarding wifi stability.</p><p>UPD: checked out LEDE, no difference wifi-wise - 5G stable, shows 80% in luci (I&#039;m 3m away from router, clear visibility), if I connect to 2.4G it shows 47% and I get packet loss often, so basically 2.4G is unstable on it just like on OpenWRT trunk, no difference. Also my usb audio card does not work properly on both OpenWRT and LEDE trunks:</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@mi:~# speaker-test

					<p>I can confirm that EEPROM patching adds a bit to the RSSI on router side (roughly 2dBm for my channels 36-48 just like andy.padawan said), signal increased from around -50 to around -48, which might positively affect speed, but I have no extra network device to measure performance, running iperf on the router itself won&#039;t show maximum speed since router&#039;s cpu gets overloaded by iperf - need to get an extra laptop, maybe later this week I&#039;ll be able to do speed comparison for default EEPROM vs patched EEPROM.

I got ~200Mbit/s between the router and my laptop when I ran iperf directly on the router, so it would be pointless to use 100Mbit/s port for tests. Looks like there is no real way to test the performance difference, since the router does not have any Gigabit ports, and running speed test wirelessly between two devices is not representative imo. I tried anyway and got around 100Mbit/s, twice less then between 1 device and the router. So probably 200Mbit/s is the router&#039;s limit (on 5G).
