					<p>Hello Guys,</p><p>Thanks for visiting my post. Please have a look at the below pic for an overview of my current setup. </p><p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/ysh6c12k1/"><span class="postimg"><img src="https://s32.postimg.org/dvky7d4j9/NTWK_DG.png" alt="https://s32.postimg.org/dvky7d4j9/NTWK_DG.png" /></span></a></p><p>This is the router&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/ar7516">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/arcadyan/ar7516</a> I&#039;m seeking help for. </p><p>Now the issues I have are as follows ...</p><ul><li><p>No internet access inside the router to do any software updates or to do diagnosis</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Can&#039;t access OpenWrt router default gateway from any of the devices connected via DHCP</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>My WISP has login portal with time out setting in which I need to login each time when new device is connected. And it automatically logs out after certain period of time when internet is not used. And also in power cut times. Looking for a hack/trick for this login such that openwrt automates the hassle.</p></li></ul><p>After sorting the above main issues then I need to do the following and need help from this community</p><ul><li><p>Setup DNS server for privacy and adblocking</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Setup VPN/tunneling</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Setup NAS</p></li></ul><p>Hoping to get my issues resolved soon. Please any help is much appreciated and If possible please post a step by step guide or else doing random things will mess up. Thnx.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------xxx-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><span class="bbu"><strong>Solution</strong></span></p><p>Few things to know about this model before you follow the steps. This router is not a mainstream supported model where is firmware built upon the sources of other model. Due to this reason the firmware doesn&#039;t automatically pickup WAN interface where the 4 ports are generally mapped as VLAN switch with LAN interface. This is where the trouble starts if we&#039;re not aware how the switch works internally with this router. Plugging ISP to WAN cable will make the router work as DUMB AP instead of its own.But to setup as main OpenWrt router and to manage traffic we need to make sure to setup a separate WAN interface using VLAN switch. After having all these confusions I finally got help from couple of forum members and was able to solve it. </p><p>FYI I&#039;ve made a small infographics image on how this router ports are physically mapped to the OpenWrt internal vlan switch, check below.</p><p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/jse6gdxrf/"><span class="postimg"><img src="https://s25.postimg.org/jse6gdxrf/BB_Opn_Wrt.png" alt="https://s25.postimg.org/jse6gdxrf/BB_Opn_Wrt.png" /></span></a></p><br /><p>Please follow the steps below:</p><p>NB: Through out the process till the step 17 make sure you connect the LAN to either <strong>LAN2/LAN3</strong> of the router ports because in this guide we had to do the changes for LAN1 and LAN4 and it may cause disruptions while accessing the router page. If you have any doubts in below steps then please refer to the above pic in which the overall settings for switch should be as shown.<br /></p><ul><li><p>1. Flash the OpenWrt image as per model wiki instructions</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>2. Using terminal telent into the router and change the root password</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>3. Now go to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> in browser and login to OpenWrt Luci Web UI using your root password</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>4. Top navigation bar go to Network&gt;&gt;Switch</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>5. Under <strong>VLANs on &quot;eth0&quot; (BCM63xx)</strong> at the very end of the page on left click <strong>Add</strong> button</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>6. A new VLAN will be created with specific VLAN ID number(Can use your own numbers if needed)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>7. For VLAN ID[1] under <strong>port 3</strong> change <strong>untagged</strong> to <strong>off</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>8. For VLAN ID[2] under <strong>port 3</strong> change <strong>off</strong> to <strong>untagged</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>9. For VLAN ID[2] under <strong>CPU</strong> change <strong>off</strong> to <strong>tagged</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>10. Finally click <strong>&quot;Save and Apply&quot;</strong> button</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>11. Next from top navigation go to Network&gt;&gt;Interfaces page</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>12. Under <strong>Interface Overview </strong>bottom left click on <strong>Add new interface</strong> button</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>13. Name the new interface as <strong>wan</strong> (use only lowercase)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>14. Next for Protocol of the new interface chose <strong>DHCP</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>15. Next <strong>check</strong> for <strong>Create a bridge over multiple interfaces</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>16. Finally chose <strong>VLAN Interface: &quot;eth0.2&quot; (wan)</strong> and <strong>Wireless Network: Master &quot;OpenWrt&quot; (lan, wan)</strong> options under <strong>Cover the following interface</strong> and click <strong>Submit</strong> button</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>17. Please double check all the options again and reboot the router.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>18. Now plug the WISP cable to WAN/LAN4 of the router and your computer LAN to any of the LAN1/LAN2/LAN3 ports.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>19. Thats it we&#039;re done now your OpenWrt works as main router with WAN being picked up with DHCP.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>20. One last note for who need WiFi as its already mentioned in the model wiki page. To make the WiFi work you need to follow the instructions in wiki page and add the mac address or else it will not be picked by clients even if the radio is enabled.</p></li></ul><p>I think this tutorial will help for most of the routers which are in similar construction. I tested LAN1 and LAN4 which are interchangeable to have WAN interface and pretty much same should do for the other 2 ports. If any one tested please leave a comment so that some one can benefit from google search.</p><p>However I still need to thank @RangerZ @Davie for being with me so far. And a very special thanks for @vendant who joined us lately but with a thorough investigation and quick solution. Thanks to the community <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i0s</strong> on 6 Aug 2016, 19:37)</p>

Yes I&#039;ve added eth3 which is WAN port of my router to the LAN interface.Like I said I&#039;m not exactly sure of what I&#039;m doing with, so messing up LAN settings keeps me off to router gateway and had to re-flash to get it back. So I left it like that as long as I&#039;m getting internet. Thats the reason I&#039;ve posted here.</p><p>Check the link below for my service providers box and there is no way I can access to it unless I hack it which I&#039;m not good at.And yes it only does DHCP and Static IP is provided only on customer request.</p><p><a href="http://www.telenetsystems.com/wifi/wifi-outdoor-cpe.htm">http://www.telenetsystems.com/wifi/wifi-outdoor-cpe.htm</a> </p><p>Actually having OpenWrt as my router is my first priority because on ISP device I can&#039;t pretty much do any kind of hacks. Sorry to ask, if possible could you please explain step by step for setting up Openwrt as router. When I reset to default all I get is only LAN interface with static IP no WAN interface.</p>									</div>

I completely agree with you and at times I did wonder that due to not being a mainstream model I&#039;m facing issues.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been posting on the other post which is active and I&#039;m waiting for the reply. I&#039;ll post the so far updates again today and see if i can get help.</p><p>Also I did setup the WAN interface as you mentioned and I&#039;m pretty sure I did the same way in my previous tries. But to say in generic way once the WAN is setup and cable is connected then it should automatically pick DHCP and give the internet access but in my case nothing is happening like that. So I&#039;m not sure whether its straight forward or do I have to do additional settings for this model.</p><p>If I&#039;m not getting help in fixing this then think I got 2 options either I&#039;ve to find any spare router and setup AP with both or find a new router under $50 and do full setup. But again I need to do some research to find best reliable routers both new/used conditon under $50 that supports both openwrt &amp; ddwrt. Only time will tell <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Fingers crossed.</p>									</div>

Thanks for joining me here.</p><p>I know it would be confusing when anyone joins in the middle of the conversation. But still I&#039;m happy to start from scratch again. I&#039;ve just re-flashed the firmware image from this download link <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/brcm63xx/generic/openwrt-15.05.1-brcm63xx-generic-A4001N-squashfs-cfe.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal … fs-cfe.bin</a>. After flashing I&#039;ve used telnet and changed the root password and then logged into Luci Web Interface. To show you the settings I&#039;ve taken pictures of some essential setting pages from luci web interface. These are the default settings that appear once I logged in after flashing the firmware. Please check the gallery link below.</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/gallery/27cq512kc/">http://postimg.org/gallery/27cq512kc/</a></p><p>From the above screenshots you can check and let me know what needs to be added/changed.</p><p>Thank you</p>									</div>

Won&#039;t believe till today think I almost done re-flashing nearly 35 times or even more. Specifically every time I mess up with settings under LAN interface or any other stuff linked with LAN I eventually loose the host connection and end up re flashing.</p><p>Anyway coming to your settings first thing I noticed is under port 0 when we turn off VLAN1 then immediately host goes down and can only access it from other 3 ports. So once I applied your changes I had to plug in WAN to port0 and LAN to port1/port2/port3 to access the host(192.168.1.1). When I pinged using diagnostics tool it says &quot;bad: wrong address&quot;.</p><p>One more important thing I noticed is, HWaddr for Ethernet on both LAN and WAN interfaces are nulled and think those might be the prime suspects for WAN to recognise physically. </p><p>Please let me know your thoughts on this.</p><p>PS: With your settings I&#039;ve just taken the logs like earlier I did and will paste the links in next post.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, forgot one step: after you set port 0 as untagged for VLAN 2, you also need to set CPU port as tagged for VLAN 2. After that port 0 will become your WAN port and it&#039;ll only work if you plug in your WISP LAN cable. You can use the other three ports for LAN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vedant</strong> on 6 Aug 2016, 12:08)</p>

And I did report back saying my router was not accessible after i did the changes via command line.

					<p>Thank you guys for all the help. </p><p>Think I&#039;m done with the first milestone. </p><p>Now time for 2nd one I&#039;m not sure whether I need to open a new topic or can continue here. But the second one is like this, like said I&#039;m using WISP device and ISP have given a IP address in which I need to type in browser and login every time to get access to internet. This will be frustrating at times when we need to do for every device and when ever there is power cut also strange part is even If I&#039;m connected and don&#039;t use internet for a while it automatically disconnects and had to login again. Especially when we need to run internet for long hours and if it disconnects without knowingly then we might get wasted.</p><p>However the ISP has an option to enable automatic login on web portal but its not really helping think due to DHCP. If I register for automatic login from one device via DHCP IP and at times when DHCP IP gets updated to new one then again I need to register for automatic login. If I&#039;m not wrong thats how its working I guess.</p><p>I&#039;ve done some google search and looked at some cron job scripts but not exactly sure if they work.I&#039;m not good at scripting need to take someones help. Please let me know your inputs based on that I can close this thread and open new.</p><p>Regards <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i0s</strong> on 6 Aug 2016, 19:56)</p>

					<p>Based on the current topic description and the issue, I think you are better starting a new topic to get more visibility.</p><p>I have faced a similar problem in the past trying to use hotel hotspots, and not aware of a clear solution.&nbsp; For me the portal page does not always open as it should.&nbsp; I have resorted to saving the hotel portal page as a desktop shortcut and using this to connect to the portal.&nbsp; I also have noticed that the clients lease gets terminated prior to the 24 hrs the portal page indicates.</p><p>I realize this is not what you are asking, but I am just sharing some related tidbits that may at some point be relevant.</p>									</div>
