					<p>[ Apologies in advance if what I&#039;m asking is already answered somewhere else--of which I&#039;m almost certain that it is.&nbsp; One problem is, that right now I&#039;m a bit too confused about the thing as a whole and don&#039;t feel capable of deciding in how far existing documentation matches my own situation or not.&nbsp; Pointers to existing documentation as answers are definitely welcome! ]</p><p>Hey everyone,</p><p>to put the following into some context: I recently came into possession of (i.e. now carry the responsibility for) a small but--from my humble perspective--completely over-engineered IT-setup belonging to a small kind-of-non-profit enterprise running on a shoestring budget.&nbsp; To--among other things--keep myself from going insane in the long run I&#039;m planning to do some major restructuring/simplification of the current setup.&nbsp; As one first and pretty minor step into that direction I plan to move the currently server hosted wireless access to it&#039;s own dedicated machine.&nbsp; (I plan to replace the main server with a clean install once I got the current situation disentangled enough to feel comfortable about doing so.)</p><p>As the dedicated &quot;machine&quot; I&#039;ve already got a cheap TP-Link TL-WR841ND on which I installed OpenWrt (Chaos Calmer) without any problems.</p><p>The setup that I&#039;m aiming for right now is meant to provide the following functionality:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- One wireless network (let&#039;s say with SSID &quot;internal&quot;) that has access restricted to known MAC-addresses.&nbsp; Optional but nice would be individual passwords per MAC if that&#039;s possible with OpenWrt.&nbsp; The &quot;internal&quot; network would only be used by a handful of devices which should be able to access and be accessible by other devices on the local network.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Another wireless network (let&#039;s say &quot;guests&quot;) with a single password and no MAC based filtering.&nbsp; Devices connected to this network (the vast majority of wireless devices here) should only be able to access the internet and nothing else (i.e. no other device on the local network).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- The whole wireless setup is supposed to be an extension to the existing or &quot;main&quot; network, that is: the wireless router is /not/ supposed to be the one routing the whole internet traffic.&nbsp; One reason for that is that we have a redundant internet connection (i.e. one fallback uplink to another ISP) which is already managed by a separate router... and even though I have plans to replace that router (a virtual machine running pfsense on the main server) with a new one (dedicated hardware running OPNsense)&nbsp; also, I&#039;d prefer to keep the wireless setup separated from the main network.</p><p>Before I now loose myself in a long text containing lots of conditionals, let me put up a very simple sketch of a setup that I currently think should be possible/might make sense:</p><p>(ISP1|ISP2)==Main Router--(Main Network: 192.168.0.x)--Wireless Router==(&quot;internal&quot;: 192.168.1.x|&quot;guests&quot;: 192.168.2.x)</p><p>(Sorry for my non-existant ASCII art skills.)</p><p>The gist of the setup is as follows:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- the wireless router is connected to the main network by the WAN port<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- both &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;guests&quot; use their own subnet<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- the &quot;internal&quot; subnet should be fully routed (i.e. devices in .1.x should be addressable from .0.x and vice versa)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- devices in &quot;guests&quot; should not be able to directly address any devices in .0.x or .1.x but only the internet (whether they should be able to address each other I&#039;m somewhat undecided on/do not care so much about)</p><p>Here now are a few specific questions regarding the described setup:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. (generic) does the approach make sense in general or are there better ones?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. (minor) are there ways to set up the full (i.e. non-dnsmasqued) routing of &quot;internal&quot; by configuring the wireless router only, or is it necessary (as I suspect) to explicitly configure the routing to .1.x on the main router also (which would not be a big deal, but somehow I think it would be nice to have the wireless setup completely self-contained/only depend on getting a DHCP address for the WAN interface)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. (big one) what would be the best/most simple approach for setting up the &quot;guests&quot; network?&nbsp; As far as I understand it most descriptions for setting up a guest only wireless network assume that the WAN connection is &quot;free for all&quot; (i.e. the ISP uplink).&nbsp; Does anyone have a link to a description that matches the described setup?&nbsp; (Preferably a LuCI-based description... amongst other things because it would simplify the task of documenting things internally.)</p><p>As an additional note: I realize that a DMZ setup with either two main routers or a single DMZ-capable router with enough lan ports (not currently the case) and a dedicated guest wireless router might(?) be the preferable approach from a security perspective, but that would not only incur additional costs/introduce additional points of failure/complicate the setup, but also seems to be a bit overkill for our situation because our &quot;guests&quot; wireless is also rather closed regarding the number of people that are supposed to use it.</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p><p>Regards<br />Joe</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ajoe</strong> on 16 Oct 2015, 20:08)</p>
