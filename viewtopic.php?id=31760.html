					<p>You are confusing me: one day you edit the topic about flashing from cli in the wiki, today you claim not to know how to do that?!<br />Anyway, I would recommend to flash again (most likely a full image like Sam mentioned, not just a sysupgrade - you might have configs in the filesystem which don&#039;t fit with the version of the new packages) and after that follow the wiki step by step. If that does not work, post a log of all the steps you took.</p>									</div>

					<p>I apologize if I confused anyone. I have a somehow decent knowledge about *nix administration but am also willing to use web UIs as much as I can.<br />I&#039;ve tried to use 10.03.1-rc5 with just the web UI. But wifi is not wirking at all.<br />With CLI I&#039;ve seen the hostapd was not running and had little idea on how to manually start it.<br />So I did an installation of trunk via web UI. But then the web UI was gone. So, CLI was the only way to go.<br />I know shell CLI, but have little idea on how the OpenWRT ditribution is organized. This is why I am asking.<br />Back to the issue.<br />I&#039;ve reverted back to official firmware and then went to trunk-factory (the 8MB image, I mean).<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>BusyBox v1.18.5 (2011-09-05 22:11:41 CEST) built-in shell (ash)
