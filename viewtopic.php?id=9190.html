					<p>Hi,<br />I have read lots of the documentation and successfully loaded RC6 PPPOE onto a new WL500gPremium but I am unclear about the mis-mapped gpio on the reset button... does it mean that the reset button doesn&#039;t work the same as in stock Asus F/W? (recovery mode while powering up, default settings etc.).</p><p>I am trying to be prepared in case I break something and need to reset.&nbsp; Should I be re-mapping the gpio in nvram?</p><p>I have looked at the following in the docs:</p><p>The reset button does not work (due largely to mis-mapped /proc/sys/reset)<br />gpio 0 = RESTORE button (reset) (00 = unpressed, 01 = pressed)<br />gpio 1 = Power LED (enable = off, disable = on)<br />gpio 4 = EZ SETUP button (similar to linksys &quot;button&quot;?) (00 = unpressed, 01 = pressed)</p><p>Not sure how to use that... Can someone direct me to some more info or assist please.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Chris</p>									</div>
