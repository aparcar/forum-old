					<p>Hello,</p><p>First off I apologize if this is a redundant question. I&#039;ve been searching for hours and have no answer.</p><p>I have a USR5461 which I tried to flash with the following file openwrt-usr5461-squashfs.bin (white russian) which was the third attempt after the other two which were kamikaze&#039;s the native USR firmware update said were too big. Anyway, this one worked for a little while, but then I could not connect.</p><p>I can&#039;t ping.<br />I can&#039;t ssh.<br />I can&#039;t telnet.<br />I can&#039;t tftp.</p><p>BUT, I do know that the IP address for the router is 192.168.1.1 because I used a packet sniffer and saw the &quot;Press reset now, to enter Failsafe!&quot; being broadcast.</p><p>So, why I can&#039;t connect?</p><p>Much thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have a couple of these routers and have tried everything (even building my own firmware) to get them to be more useful.&nbsp; But they are very limited routers, in the end they are pretty disappointing. </p><p>I think your openwrt-usr5461-squashfs.bin image may be too big.&nbsp; Anyhow I&#039;ve tried flashing with this and got an openwrt login for just a second or two, then it went away and the router seemed dead.</p><p>Currently my 2 USR5461s are running dd-wrt.v24-14853_VINT_micro-plus.bin, which seems to perform satisfactorily.&nbsp; You can get this from the DD-WRT site.&nbsp; Running this image means a flexible, configurable router, but no USB print serving.&nbsp; (But maybe you can figure out a way?)</p><p>I recovered these routers from many disasterous adventures by setting up tftp like:</p><p>(on workstation:)<br />sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.2<br />tftp 192.168.2.1<br />&gt;trace<br />&gt;rexmt 1<br />&gt; binary<br />&gt; put dd-wrt.v24-14853_VINT_micro-plus.bin&nbsp; &lt;--- before hitting ENTER, do the following:</p><p>Power up the router, stick a paper clip in the reset and wait 10 seconds or so for all the front lights to flash together, pull out the paper clip and hit ENTER above.&nbsp; If you are lucky you will see the image uploading quickly.</p><p>I put 192.168.2.2, 192.168.2.1 above because I thought this was the recovery IP, maybe my memory is fuzzy.&nbsp; You can find out by configuring eth0 as, say, 192.168.2.2, then doing:</p><p>arping -f -I eth0 192.168.2.1</p><p>and following the paper clip routine above.&nbsp; If you get a ping from arping, then that&#039;s the IP.&nbsp; If not, try 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.1, arping, etc.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, everything just times out. The arping, the tftp and everything else I threw at it. Looks like it&#039;s time to get a new modem.</p>									</div>
