					<p>I installed White Russian 0.9 on my WRT54GL 1.1, but can&#039;t telnet or ssh to it to set it up. I&#039;m able to connect to it as I could before flashing (same ip address, same WPA password), but I it time&#039;s out when I even try to ping it. Does it use I weird port or something (not 22/23)? I should say that it&#039;s been rebooted. Am I fucked? Or what should I try?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>update: the problem must have been caused by Windows cashing the wireless setup. Once I tried it on another computer (another Windows machine) I was able to telnet to it with no problems at all. Not only did the ESSID show up as &quot;OpenWrt&quot; instead of the name I was using before I flashed it, the network was unsecured (Windows was saying it was using the same WPA password as before)... weird...</p>									</div>
