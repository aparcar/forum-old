Another option is to place a script in &quot;/etc/hotplug.d/iface&quot; this will run as soon as the interface is started. This should be early enough in the boot process.

It shows all opened nat connections, with source, destination. So you can easily see and debug stuff, for example look for fishy connections.

					<p>I still dont know whats causing the connection issues on my clients. I just turned on my Laptop, booted into Windows, and I had no internet connection. Chrome showed a ERR_TIMED_OUT for all pages, but after about 1 minute, all started working and is working since now. It seems some to be a weird issue with tcp and the firewall of the router. As if the router doesnt clear tcp connections properly and they time out and then are blocked. I immediately looked over ssh on the router of course and during the timeout phase on my client, no disconnects or drops happened, ping worked fine on the router itself.</p><p>edit:<br />I had just a random thought, and I disabled tcp/ipv6 on my Windows client, and I had no connectivity issue anymore since then so far (for the last 30 minutes). Could be coincidence, but also related. How do I disable ipv6 100% on lede? It always is such a pain and just leads to problems. Should I add a option ipv6 &#039;0&#039; to lan and wan in network is that the wrong way to go? I also added a net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 to sysctl.conf and will monitor if this helps.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 21 Nov 2017, 12:53)</p>
