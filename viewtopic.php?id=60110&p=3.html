					<p>GREAT.. I just came across this information from a different model TM05, TM06 did not explain this.<br />Has this changed with new model? Revert firmware to Hootoo ?<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />WIP OpenWrt Install</p><p>Warning!<br />This section describes actions that might damage your device or firmware. Proceed with care!</p><p>From this forum post about the HT-TM06; works on the HT-TM05 as well.</p><p>WARNING: We haven&#039;t found a way to revert back to HooToo&#039;s stock firmware yet! If you follow this process, it&#039;s permanent! In order to revert back, you will have to send it in for service. Although HooToo Support has been very gracious with a few people about this, this will void your warranty and HooToo will have no responsibility to replace it.</p><p>Make sure you read through the entire list of steps before beginning.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Download this OpenWrt firmware: Link<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Place it in the root of a clean TFTP server running on your computer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rename the image to kernel — be sure there is no file extension, and that there are no other files on the TFTP server.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Plug the HT-TM05 into your computer via ethernet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Set your computer to use 10.10.10.254 as its IP address.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; With your HT-TM05 shut down, hold down the power button until the first white LED lights up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Push and hold the reset button and release the power button. Continue holding the reset button for 30 seconds or until it begins searching for files on your TFTP server, whichever comes first.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The HT-TM05 will look for your computer at 10.10.10.254 and install the kernel file. Once it has finished installation of the kernel file, it will search for a (nonexistent) rootfs file — when it begins searching for this file, shut down the HT-TM05 by holding the power button normally.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Start up your HT-TM05 normally. When the Wi-Fi indicator turns green, OpenWrt has booted successfully.</p><p>OpenWrt uses 192.168.1.1 as the default router IP address, so you will need to switch your computer back to a dynamic IP address, or change your static IP address to 192.168.1.X to configure OpenWrt.<br />Tags</p><p>How to add tags</p>									</div>

Then did you install the ddserver from the local file?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, how?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried installing from the command line of WinSCP, and getting a bunch of errors.&nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve done a bunch of googling and seem to get further and further down the rabbit hole.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly technical but feeling a little lost with this.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know what I was getting into!&nbsp; Would love any help you (or anyone else) could provide.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>JWoff</strong> on 19 Aug 2017, 09:04)</p>
