But what about setting up more than one vlan on the same port?<br />Another question, I read in the ADM datasheet that it is possible to control the bandwith on each port: 256k, 512k, 1M, 2M, 5M, 10M, 20M, 50M. Is this possible with the adm6996 module?</p></blockquote></div><p>I answer myself. I could configure a few vlans on each port.<br />But I still have doubts with the bandwidth control that the ADM switch says it performs. In the /proc directory I found the files speed and bandwith, but I think they are for the Physic Medium:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#cat /proc/sys/dev/adm6996/port1/speed
100
#cat /proc/sys/dev/adm6996/port1/bandwidth
Full</code></pre></div><p>I think they say 100Mbps Full Duplex<br />So I&#039;m not controlling the BW yet.</p>									</div>
