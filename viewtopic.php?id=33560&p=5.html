RoundSparrow mentioned being able to support F7D4301/F7D8301, and I also saw that Manoj made a <a href="http://manojpi.blogspot.com/2012/05/openwrt-on-belkin-share-max-n300.html">patch for openwrt on F7D3301/F7D7301</a>.&nbsp; Last year I got a few on ebay just to play with and even sent one to dd-wrt developer eko.&nbsp; These routers have generally good hardware (480mhz + 64mb ram), but crappy stock firmware. So these are good inexpensive devices to pick up used.&nbsp; The only drawback I think is they are not gigabit, though not everyone needs that. I once tried to checkout the dd-wrt source to see if I could compile it myself, but I couldn&#039;t figure out how they organized things and there was many dozens of gigabytes of sources. What a mess!</p><p>Anyway it seems like BCM47XX development has been coming along quite well, so I want to congratulate and encourage you guys to keep it up!

					<p>@Viernses: Thanks for reposting so quick. I am using the same patches (2012-05-28T17-30). The problem I described wasn&#039;t so much that the patch you suggested didn&#039;t work against r32096, but that it failed to apply against the 2012-05-28T17-30/002-openwrt4716-TARGET_brcm4716-deps.patch. I also tried to apply it by hand, but got a malformed patch when I tried to use it. Comparing r32096 and r32786, I see that the substance of your patch should be relevant to r32786. I will test building r32086 with vanilla 17-30 patches, tonight. Also, I will try to figure out if I am doing something wrong when I use your patch against the 002 deps patch.</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>stygian</p><p>ps,</p><p>I managed to get your patch to apply using fuzz (3) in patch command line. I am building r32096 right now and will be building r32786 tonight. It looks like I should be able to get a fairly recent build together by the time my ftdi cable comes in. Maybe I will test an image before that, since the serial mod is pretty simple and the cable is is being shipped.</p><p>Thanks again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>stygian</strong> on 17 Aug 2012, 03:12)</p>
