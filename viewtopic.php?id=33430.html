					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a couple of wr703n, and I have been flashing them back and forth. And now (no supprise) two of them are not accessible using ssh anymore.<br />And telnet was disabled the second I set the password in OpenWrt (luci).<br />The device responses to ssh, but it dont accept my root password anymore!&nbsp; Is root user locked maybe?<br />No worrires I thought, I just use the console (ttl)!? </p><p>Well..<br />I went out got me a rs232&lt;-&gt;TTL adapter and cables etc..<br /><a href="http://www.electrokit.com/rs232-ttl-nivaomvandlare.45278">http://www.electrokit.com/rs232-ttl-niv … lare.45278</a><br />Follow the instructions on this page: <a href="http://wiki.villagetelco.org/index.php?title=Building_a_Serial_Port_for_TL-WR703N">http://wiki.villagetelco.org/index.php? … _TL-WR703N</a><br />But when I connect it to my PC and reboot the device, I dont get anything that I can read, just a little of unreadable characters.<br />I am guessing that there is something wrong in my RS232 settings: 115200, N, 8, 1. But no matter what I do, I cant get it to send something thats make sense.<br />Have tried with a couple different windows softwares, even found minicom on my linux box, same thing.</p><p>Thought for a while that I maybe broke the device when I was trying to connect the cables to those tiny places on the board, but then I took the other device and instead made a fixture that holds the cables connected, and got the exact same problem.</p><p>Now these to small blue boxes are just lying on my desk mocking me! </p><p>I need help! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/neutral.png" width="15" height="15" alt="neutral" /> any help.</p><p>Regards<br />-Anders</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>carlberg</strong> on 10 Dec 2011, 01:25)</p>
