					<p>Thank you very much for your answer!</p><p>1. So with Linux running on this SoC is (can there be)&nbsp; there an eth0, eth1 and eth2 or is there just eth0?<br />2. Is the switch manageable?<br />3. How do you know that?</p><p>Before asking I googled and the first hit at Qualcomm Atheros are some god-damned pictures: <a href="http://www.qca.qualcomm.com/corporate/content.php?nav1=128">http://www.qca.qualcomm.com/corporate/c â€¦ p?nav1=128</a><br />This is quite annoying.</p><p>Compare this to Broadcom products, e,.g. google for&nbsp; BCM4704 or BCM4321 or BCM6368 or ... where you will find actual information, often a data sheet, which is what I am looking for.<br />Also, there are links in the oldwiki to old Broadcom products, that still work. Which is good and useful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Now i got a job related to atheros chipset,so i have the chance to read some datasheet.<br />1.as i know,it create two interface in linux,every interface correspond to a mac(not the mac in the internal switch).about this,you can see the openwrt linux kernel code,wr703n/mr11u only use one of the mac,wr740n v4 will use two of the mac.<br />2.yes,manage it by some internal mapped register.</p><p>But with the NDL,i can&#039;t share the datasheet and much more info to you!So sad ...<br />And i&#039;m a chipset datasheet fans,so i really love a perfect datasheet(not means ar9331&#039;s datasheet is perfect,in fact,it&#039;s a bad datasheet as i see),it&#039;s just like a art!i like to see the chipset block diagram.I think i understand the man who seek a datasheet,hope one day you will get a datasheet by some way,good luck.</p>									</div>
