					<p>Hello,</p><p>Device: TL-WDR4300 v1.7 <br />Openwrt : Fresh install from the TP stock firmware&nbsp; Chaos Calmer 15.05</p><p>as in the title, I did a fresh install two times, and on each occasion when I change the channel in 5GHz after 2 or 3 times hit the save and apply button the WiFi won&#039;t start( disabled ), whatever I do reboot , Enable/Disable or add and remove the interface or playing with values I am afraid all failed, then on the second fresh re-install 5GHz works again, but it will fail after changing channels. </p><p>also it takes ages for the setting to be applied ( up to 10 sec ), additionally I&#039;ve tested the internet( in this test I am talking about local network no wifi )&nbsp; it&#039;s externally heavy comparing to the stock firmware.</p><p>A question did they manage to enable the hardware acceleration on the 15.05?</p><p>cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>testooo</strong> on 16 Sep 2015, 16:18)</p>

					<p>Well, don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t use it. Or help fix the problem by providing useful bug reports and helping to troubleshoot. Or fix the code yourself.

					<p>fwiw, I spent a bit of time investigating the issue on my Mynet N750.&nbsp; I have two units but only one is live.&nbsp; Both were originally flashed from WD stock fw to CC rc3.&nbsp; Then recently I sys-upgraded them to CC 15.05 final.&nbsp; I kept my settings during the sys-upgrade.</p><p>Experimenting with my spare N750, I decided to flash the CC 15.05 final &#039;factory&#039; bin to the router.&nbsp; I did not reload my live router settings file.</p><p>My observations with changing channel numbers on 5 GHz band were as follows.&nbsp; Using Country code: GB.&nbsp; There doesn&#039;t appear to be any issue if I change channel between channel numbers 36, 40, 44 or 48.&nbsp; Usually the change is completed in less than 30 seconds and my laptops don&#039;t appear to report loss of wifi signal during the switch over.</p><p>If I choose to use channels 52 or higher, or 100 or higher, this is where I now observe the router can take about 1-2 minutes to effect the change.&nbsp; &nbsp;The laptops also report loss of wifi signal but eventually the signal does return.&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand channels 52 and above have to use DFS which may explain the behaviour.</p><p>LUCI can also sometimes be&nbsp; horrendously slow at updating the wifi status on the page. May be worse because there was no WAN connection during these tests (I use PPPoE so WAN port is disconnected).&nbsp; &nbsp;I also noticed if I edit the channel number and press &#039;Save &amp; Apply&#039; button, it some times did not appear to work.&nbsp; The channel number remained unchanged after waiting patiently for the page to refresh.&nbsp; &nbsp; I use chrome web browser in Windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;I find if I open an &#039;Incognito&#039; web session to the router, LUCI seems to behave better.&nbsp; &nbsp; I use INSSIDer to verify the presence of the wifi signal and the channel number it is using.</p><br /><p>Next step was to load my live router settings file into the test router to see if it made any difference.&nbsp; The settings don&#039;t appear to alter the behaviour of the N750 to what I have already described above.&nbsp; Note the test router is Not connected to WAN.</p><br /><p>Next, I wired the above test router into one of the LAN ports of my live N750 router so it has access to the internet.&nbsp; (WAN connection changed from PPPoE to DHCP client, and LAN subnet changed to 192.168.0.x).&nbsp; </p><p>From what I learned earlier, I didn&#039;t have any difficulties changing wifi channel.&nbsp; </p><p>Finally I turned my attention to my live router which has been operating uninterupted for past 9 days.&nbsp; I changed the wifi channel from no.36 to 52 to 100 to 132 and back to no.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;The changes were all completed successfully.</p><br /><p>My conclusion is it looks like I was simply impatient when previously trying to test wifi channel no. above 48.&nbsp; It appears higher channel numbers take up to 2 minutes to initialize instead of 20-30 seconds.&nbsp; There also seems to be an odd issue with how LUCI was behaving when using Chrome web browser.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bob8</strong> on 21 Sep 2015, 21:51)</p>
