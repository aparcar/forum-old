					<p>to my knowledge the usb plug has 500 mah. 5v. which makes me want to look at the router. the router is rated 5v 1a. which is twice as much power as the usb which is why it comes with a wall adapter. the wall adapter is also 1A. double check yours because i have 2 and one is 500 mah the other is 1a.&nbsp; ehhh... </p><p>what do we do ? we test the box with&nbsp; a 5v 1A source of power to see if it works. if that does work then the problem is solved and that you would need more power than a usb port can give you.</p><p>if it doesnt work then we would need to test it with stock firmware to see if it does work. if it does work then it&#039;s coding porblem where&nbsp; a switch isnt flipped in the right place or right time. <br />if it doesnt work then its a power source issue. <br />someone please be kind enough to test and let us know if it will work with a better power supply which in theory should. </p><p>--on a side note. does anyone know how to decrypt the stock firmware and encrypt it again. i want to hexedit the chinese out with english.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>faramisimo</strong> on 23 Oct 2011, 04:23)</p>

					<p>There are two possible reasons. The internal voltage regulator has max output somewhere between 300mA and 500mA (can not be determined exactly, because the number on the chip does not identify it), the same goes for the regulator that supplies the USB port.</p><p>If you add up all absolute maximum ratings , you can get up to 1A, but the actual consumtion is nowhere near that.</p><p>Computer USB ports supply by default 100mA USB 1.0, 2.0 , USB 3.0 150mA, but depends on the computer. Higher current draw is only enabled if there is a communication through the port and the device negotiates a high-power mode.

					<p>they all work just fine without the extra usb dongle. </p><p>now if some of the modems do work and a couple of brands dont, that&#039;s not a power issue. i also dont think its an issue getting enough power from the usb port since it also doesnt work with the 1.0A PSU and thats well more than what it needs. </p><p>the modem powers up when connected (i guess in standby mode).&nbsp; this shows that the power is there and waiting for a command to activate.&nbsp; we should find out whats going on in that area.. what is the commands that are sent for activation if any and if there is some sort of communication between the 2 is it the right command for waking it up?</p><p>i am not sure how to check that so i will leave it for someone who knows his/her stuff. </p><p>good luck</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, I just bricked my 703n last night when trying to flash it with openwrt trunk compiled by myself. Now it doesn&#039;t response to anything, reset during powerup, ping, telnet... nothing. The power led just keep lighted solidly. Any idea?</p><p>I think I have to go with the serial console. As already pointed out, TP_In is Rx and TP_Out is Tx. Where&#039;s the GND? I saw a TPGND on the PCB. But that position is just impossible to solder (The solder of TP_In and TP_Out are already quite difficult for my v1.1 PCB, but they still worth a trying). Could the shielding ground (like the metal cover of the USB connector) be used?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>P.S.
