					<p>Hi,<br />I bought a TP-Link TL-WR841N router and installed openwrt.<br />I want to use the router for the boarding school in which I live.<br />In the boarding school everyone had to register in a h.t.t.p-proxy with an username and a password to access the internet. I have to setup the proxy 192.168.15.200:3128 and the static IP for the router in my case 192.168.136.10, Gateway: 192.168.136.9, Subnetmask: 255.255.255.0<br />In addition I have to ask 2 questions:</p><p>1. Is it possible to configure the router so that I do not have to set up the proxy for all my devices and do not must authenticate myself every time I want to use the internet? Can I set up the router, so it will make that for all my traffic?</p><p>2. I have made experience that the Internet is very slow, because almost all of the 300 students constantly watch YouTube videos on the 100 Mbit / s line. I discovered that I could reach my download speed up by split the downloads in multiple connections with download managers like Jdownloader. Now I have to ask if this is possible even for my normal traffic to speed up surfing on the internet? I would love to set this all up in the router. Any ideas?</p><p>PS: I am a complete noob when it comes to openwrt and linux and my English is not very good.</p><p>Thanks for your help<br />AdmerStroh</p>									</div>
