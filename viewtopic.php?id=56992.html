					<p>The SoC is a QCA9557 whereas the ESR1750 has a QCA9558.

					<p>I got openwrt on the esr-1200 using the firmware for the esr-1750, but it is not turning on the 5g radio... any ideas?<br />I have connected to the com port on the router and ethernet port 4, I used the upgrade firmware option from the stock firmware.</p>									</div>
