					<p>Hi All,<br />.<br />Is there anybody who has been successful in installing Chaos Calmer 15.05 on Huawei E970? (or B970b)<br />I use the following image but it doesn&#039;t work:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05/brcm47xx/legacy/openwrt-15.05-brcm47xx-legacy-e970-squashfs-gz.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_cal â€¦ hfs-gz.bin</a><br />.<br />I found an image file from earlier version that works somewhat (I believe it was Attitude Adjustment), but the latest chaos calmer seems larger than what the E970 can handle (more than 4Mb).<br />.<br />The cfe (3G Gateway Software Upgrade) always fail with message : &quot; Image uploading failed. The length of the selected file is out scope.&quot; <br />.<br />Can someone please give me a bit of help to install or build an image for E970 that works?</p>									</div>
