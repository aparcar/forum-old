Both runs fine.. ^^</p><p>Just need some help from the Pro&#039;s here ^^</p><p>Can i somehow get Kismet-Server to save the logs on my mounted Usb-Drive? Its always logging into /etc/...<br />And is there a way to tweak the nfs-server to get blocksizes greater than 8192? Can&#039;t make a mount from my Dbox with rsize and wsize greater than that..</p><p>And last but not least, can anyone give me hint Howto use the reset-button as a Wlan-On/Off-Switch? Cant get it to work..</p><p>Sincerly Shy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ShyGuy22</strong> on 16 Jan 2013, 09:33)</p>
