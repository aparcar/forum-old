					<p>I have a Linksys WRT54G v4.0. I downloaded whiterussian from CVS and compiled successfully. I then loaded openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin using the tftp instructions on <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">www.openwrt.org</a>. However, after successfully transferring the router does not boot. The Power LED just blinks. I have tried unplugging the router but that does not solve anything. Plus, the DMZ light never lights up or blinks.</p><p>Any help on debugging this would be appreciated.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve got a wrt54 v4.0 that wouldn&#039;t boot... though after a long long while the DMZ light would turn on. To fix it I had to set my computer to a static IP and use another switch to connect to the router with a crossover cable. The computer was set to 192.168.1.2, and command prompt was open with tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin typed out. I unplugged the router, plugged it back in, waited about a second until the power light started flashing and then hit enter in the command prompt window. It worked for me.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>
