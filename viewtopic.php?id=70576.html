					<p>I&#039;m a newbie with OpenWRT and I have some access points (APs) run on Openwrt firmware and I want access points share clients together. Ex: There are 20 clients and 2 APs, I want AP1 associates to 10 clients and AP2 associates 10 clients. How can I do this ? May I need a Central Controller (like OpenWiSP)? Thanks for your help and I appologize in advance for my English.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I don&#039;t know if there is something production ready. If you find something, please provide that information.</p><p>The best idea, imho, is trying to not force AP switching actively but to create an environment that lets clients decide to switch on their own.<br />Put as much room between your APs as possible, ideally with some walls. Reduce the signal strength to an absolute minimum. If you can&#039;t cover your area with a given number of routers at minimum transmission power, better add more APs with minimum transmission power instead of increasing transmission power of your existing APs.</p><p>That can be adjusted a little. Maybe create some scripts running on each AP that maps the number of connected clients to the transmission power. The more clients connected, the less transmission power. An AP that has no client at all can send with nearly maximum power to be attractive to clients. An AP which has reached a certain number of clients should reduce its transmission power to the lowest value possible to make it attractive for connected clients to switch away.</p><p>If you need to cover some large rooms, make your APs not only stay away from each other but keep them away from doors as well. When a lot of people enter a room through a singe door, all smart phones might decide to connect to the very first AP available and stay there. Maybe if your door is on the south side of a room, place the APs on east and west, which gives a 50% chance foreach AP to be seen first when a client enters a room.</p><p>Things like that are mostly enough.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
