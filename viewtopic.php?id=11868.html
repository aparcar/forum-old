					<p>I mentioned in another post that I&#039;m quite new to the kind of hacking OpenWRT involves and I&#039;ve also never looked into audio streaming before.&nbsp; For the past 5-6 years I&#039;ve been working my tail off starting a new business (which meant learning a lot of languages that weren&#039;t around in the &#039;80s when I learned to program on an Apple //e) and I&#039;ve finally had time to see what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; I love the idea of being able to put OpenWRT on small devices and have a computer that can fit in a small space and be used for a lot of different things.</p><p>I&#039;ve already been working with OpenWRT on a Linksys WRT54G (I bought a WRT54GS, found it was too new to do anything other than put in a micro version of DD-WRT and traded it for a the WRT54G I am now using).</p><p>I&#039;m using Slimserver with a Squeezebox to listen to my music files by wifi and I was looking at other devices and thought if I got a WRTSL54GS (and it seems, from the support pages, all versions are supported at this point), since it has a USB port, I could put OpenWRT on it, run MPD, and have MPD play the stream from Slimserver and use a USB sound card for audio (or USB speakers).&nbsp; That leads to my questions:</p><p>In devices like these, both Linksys and other brands (especially since it seems Linksys is getting less Linux friendly with some devices), when there is a connection like a USB port, is it generally a full connection?&nbsp; For example, on the WRTSL54GS the USB connector is intended to be used for storage.&nbsp; Is it common for what would seem to be standard connectors to be crippled and usable only for specific purposes?</p><p>I&#039;ve been looking into this and it looks like if I want to turn the WRTSL54GS into a music player (not a stream server, a stream player), it comes down to this:<br />1) Install OpenWRT on the device<br />2) Add either a USB sound card or USB speakers (if they don&#039;t need special drivers)<br />3) Add the MPD and MPC packages ipkg<br />4) Use the USB Audio HOWTO to set up the audio</p><p>And from there it looks like it should work.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not &quot;that easy,&quot; that there are tons of glitches along the way, but are there any major or known reasons this should not work?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen any and I&#039;ve been searching.</p><p>I considered using Linksys&#039;s WMB54G for streaming, but I don&#039;t see that anyone is successfully using it with OpenWRT, there are many complaints about it in a number of forums, I can&#039;t find a source anywhere that specifies what URL it looks to for a stream source, and it seems to cost more.</p><p>If anyone else has suggestions on products they&#039;re using to play back (and not server) audio streams, I&#039;d love to hear what is working.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve currently got a WRTSL54GS working as an mp3 jukebox and love it.&nbsp; I picked up a $20 USB audio adapter from Radio Shack (or &quot;The Source&quot; nowadays) and followed some of the howtos around the wiki/forum.&nbsp; There are packages available for mpd and the audio drivers.&nbsp; I mostly use my setup for playing mp3s from an NFS share but I&#039;ve also tested a few online radio streams and they seemed to work well too.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was thinking of eventually using something like this with an LCD screen, like on the page you linked to, but using the display as a clock so it would work as a clock radio in my bedroom and it wouldn&#039;t take much to add an alarm function to it.&nbsp; I also figured I could add an AM/FM card to the server so it could play local radio as well.</p><p>Of course, then I also have to add two buttons, one to turn the alarm off and one for snooze.&nbsp; When I&#039;m just waking up, figuring out a remote is a bit much. ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Good idea for the alarm clock.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read some other forum posts discussing LCD screens but most involve attaching a serial port, etc.&nbsp; I would think one could go w/ a USB-based screen on the SL to save the soldering work but I haven&#039;t looked into it that seriously yet.</p>									</div>

					<p>I thought there either was a serial port or the pins for one on the WRTSL54GS.&nbsp; I read the hardware hacking page on it and it mentioned some other connections.&nbsp; I figure at the least, it wouldn&#039;t be hard to replace the single USB connector with a twin one.</p><p>Have you tried USB speakers on it?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what they need in terms of actual signals on the USB speakers, but I found a number of USB speakers for decent prices, especially when you consider that for a small room it could give you a twofer -- speakers and sound card for the price of one.&nbsp; It&#039;d be great if they worked in place of a USB sound card and separate speakers.&nbsp; I know they&#039;re USB powered and don&#039;t know if the WRTSL54GS has enough power to feed them.</p>									</div>
