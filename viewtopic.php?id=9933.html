					<p>I did a base firmware install using &quot;openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx&quot; and following the directions off the web site for a V6 router.&nbsp; OpenWRT starts up just fine in a vanilla config, wifi works fine, switch works fine, all is good.</p><p>Can&#039;t be configured though.&nbsp; Trying to set the password causes the window (telnet or http) to simply lock up, not coming back with errors or anything.&nbsp; Power-cycle basically resets the scenario.</p><p>I tried safe-mode and doing a &quot;mount_root&quot; which comes back with an error.</p><p>Any tips for where to go with it appreciated.&nbsp; Different version of the firmware?&nbsp; Simple setting I&#039;m just missing?</p><p>Mike</p>									</div>

					<p>Which version of the firmware are you using?&nbsp; The v6 is considered junk by most people because it only has 2MB of flash, and as such can only hold the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/micro/">micro version</a> of OpenWrt White Russian.&nbsp; Even then, space is quite limited.</p>									</div>

					<p>default.&nbsp; that might be the problem.&nbsp; I&#039;ll get the micro on there and then post results.&nbsp; All the box is going to function as is a bridge, so I&#039;m not overly concerned about the flexibility of it...thanks for the pointer though.&nbsp; I&#039;ll avoid it in the future.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you were using the default version, then here is what happened:<br />The OpenWrt images contain the kernel and squashfs partitions; when you reboot after flashing the image, the jffs2 partition (the writable partition) is created, containing all remaining flash space.&nbsp; Since you flashed the default image, there wasn&#039;t enough room left to create a usable jffs2 partition, so as a result you can&#039;t set a password, or do anything else that performs a write operation.</p>									</div>
