					<p>The scenario:</p><p>I have a Linksys WRT1900ACS V2, with OpenWRT Installed. I have configured it as an Access Point, as my main Router is locked with my current ISP.</p><p>I would like to install and configure OpenVPN with NordVPN - but am getting stuck already in the first steps, as it seems that though my Router Functions perfectly well as an Access point, it is unable itself to download any OpenVPN packages to itself.</p><p>I&#039;ve made an SSH connection, and from here it seems i&#039;m unable to reach any host, not even ping.</p><p>Has anyone configured a Router to act as an OpenVPN Client Access Point over OpenWRT? If So, do you have any guides/tutorials you can point me to?</p><p>Thx. in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Use the IP address of your main router as default gateway on the lan interface on the access point. And use it as DNS server, or use some other DNS server such as Google&#039;s 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.</p>									</div>
