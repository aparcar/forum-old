					<p>Tonight I post to let everyone know that I have to suspend work on my build of OpenWRT.&nbsp; My free time has dwindled to 0 over the last year and I&#039;m at the point where I can no longer carve out enough time to properly support the build. 14.07 RC1 was released today and I had no idea it was coming.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not been able to keep up with the upstream sources and porting my work to the latest upstream will be a time investment that I cannot commit to at this juncture. The mirrors / sources / etc will remain online for the forseeable future but I cannot provide further development work on the build.&nbsp; Hopefully others can use my work as a starting point for bigger and better things.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who posted, used the build and gave feedback.&nbsp; This was by far the best project I&#039;ve ever been involved with.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well its not like your existing build is flawed in any way I can find.&nbsp; Looking at other router OS they ALL seem to be well behind on software versions, preferring stability over the latest functionality.&nbsp; So this is not exactly &quot;the end&quot; unless some major bug shows up.</p><p>SMP is fairly critical for me now though as I have added ip_conntrack reporting to my GUI and that alone can hang one of the cores due to the sheer number of connections, meaning the other core needs to be there to prevent it lagging the routing.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have just made the first steps in creating (a crude) x86 image that can use more then 1 core(and/or hyperthreading) and can use more then the standard max of 800mb ram. i am willing to share this (its the basic BB config but with luci)</p><p>i can also share on how i came to build this..</p><br /><p>Love to hear if there is an interrest.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yoyellow</strong> on 27 Oct 2014, 17:56)</p>
