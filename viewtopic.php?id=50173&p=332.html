					<p>I&#039;ve tried the lasted trunk and driver for half a day, but just returned to OpenWRT CC final release with the 10.3.0.3 driver. 10.3.0.10 is seriously broken with anything that even remotely smells like a broadcom chipset. Performance of the remaining devices was about 20% less then under 10.3.0.3 as well.</p><p>Anyway, at least it was a nice learning experience how to properly compile your own image with all the needed packages. Once a fix is released, i&#039;ll give it another try.</p>									</div>

					<p>I took a glance at recent 40 pages and did not find the similar situation as mine took place on my WRT1200AC from yesterday (I got the router the day before yesterday and flashed OpenWrt CC final) as below. Forgive me if such issue was mentioned or discussed before.</p><p>It is about the 2.4GHz wireless connection. I configured a guest wifi on 2.4GHz (but not&nbsp; for 5G), country code US or CN, security WPA2-AES, channel 6 or 11, width 20 or 40MHz (as I tried a few times). </p><p>The issue was, the devices connected with 5G radio would remain the connection, while those with 2.4GHz&#039;s would lose the connection (maybe standby?) after a while, and the 2.4G LED on the front panel of the router was gone. Then, when 2.4GHz devices (iPhone4, iPhone 5S with iOS8, Kindle and Huawei phone) came back, they could not be connected. I re-input password onto those devices, but it did not word. And restarting the 2.4GHz radio did not help, until a rebooting fixed it.</p><p>Will appreciate some advice on it, or such thing might come from the immature Marvell wireless driver and is supposed to be fixed someday in the near future?</p><p>==========================<br />Maybe a cron job of rebooting my router in the middle night everyday may fix it temperately but I am not fond of it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>muronghan</strong> on 26 Oct 2015, 08:25)</p>
