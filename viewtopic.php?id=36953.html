					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have been using OpenWRT on my D-Link DIR-615 C1 for some time and it is just getting better, but I am having one little problem that happens at least once a day.</p><p>After, like, 18h the router has booted the problem arises. Wireless clients whose signal are relatively low (-70 dBm, noise is at -95 dBm) are connected to the router at very low rates, according to LuCI the RX Rate is at 1Mbps and the TX Rate at 36Mbps! The TX Rate keeps changing from 36Mbps to 54Mbps and so forth, but the RX Rate gets stuck at 1Mbps. If I do not reboot the router through LuCI or SSH, no one can wirelessly connect to it anymore after some time.</p><p>Normally it reports high rates on RX and TX. I seems that this problem happens mostly when N is activated.<br />I am using r31780, is the behavior relativelly normal? I think it might have something to do with power saving.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
