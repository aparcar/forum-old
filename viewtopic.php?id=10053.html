					<p>Can I power a wgt634u directly from a car 12V supply (without damaging anything)?&nbsp; &nbsp;I see the power supply brick says 12V but vehicle battery voltage is more like 12.6V, rising to 13.8V with the engine running, and I have no idea what sort of spikes might appear when starting the engine or if the AC compressor clutch engages.</p><p>Does anybody have any experience with this?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or perhaps advice on what sort of circuit to put between the car and router?</p>									</div>

					<p>You would definitely need a regulator of some sort. Just going straight without a transformer/regulator in between is probably going to result in a more-than-bricked router.</p><p>Something similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5C400-Anywhere-Portable-Converter/dp/B00000J1TP">http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5C400-Any â€¦ B00000J1TP</a></p>									</div>

					<p>the wgt and most others for that matter are very tolerant of other voltages. 6.5V is the minimum and maximum... probably more than 18V.</p>									</div>

					<p>a simple 7806 or 7812 voltage regulator with 2 22uf ceramic caps on it should be suitable for this kind of setup (just make sure you heatsink the 78XX</p><p>Goes like this:</p><p>Left Leg: 12-49V + Input<br />Middle Leg: Common Ground<br />Right Leg: Output 6v or 12v</p><p>Put one of the 22k&#039;s on leg 1 and 2 and another from 2 to 3</p><p>Simple, Easy and up to 1.5Amp Regulation</p><p>You will NEED the 22k&#039;s as they are basically a voltage trimmer for spikes. else a smoking openwrt box when you start your car</p><br /><p>Edit: 78XX Comes in many different types<br />7803<br />7805<br />7806<br />7809<br />7812<br />7816<br />7824</p><p>Chose the one thats right for you.. and remember to have at least 1.5v extra on top of the regulation voltage or else you wont get anything from the right leg</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nisa</strong> on 25 Mar 2007, 20:53)</p>
