					<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>As most of you may know, WiFi repeaters/extenders are generally avoided&nbsp; because when they use the same channel to communicate with the router and the client, the broadband throughput is effectively cut in half.</p><p>However, this problem can be solved with Dual/Tri Band repeaters which can simultaneously communicate with the client on one channel and the router on another.</p><p>Few of these exist in the market right now including the TP-Link RE450 (OpenWRT firmware available for this one) and the Netgear Fastlane Tech routers. However, I was not able to find anywhere on this forum whether OpenWRT supports such routers i.e. allowing simultaneous transmission on both channels to eliminate/reduce the throughput loss.</p><p>The one thread I did find, did not have a conclusion: forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=70072</p><p>Please could any of the pros enlighten us of the same.</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br />Does OpenWRT support dual band extenders in such that the usual 50% bandwidth loss is eliminated?</p><p>Thanks a lot guys! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openwrt_newbie999</strong> on 13 Oct 2017, 07:01)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the reply @mk24.</p><p>I was searching through the threads for router recommendations and found this one forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=71874. Your posted:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mk24 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>The WR841 is a good choice, it is practically the same hardware as the RE850 in a conventional router form factor-- as long as you get a v12 or lower.&nbsp; The new WR841v13 has MediaTek chips.</p><p><strong>A dual band router would let you make the link on 5 GHz, saving bandwidth on 2.4.&nbsp; That won&#039;t be a big issue if your ISP speed is only DSL or slow cable though.</strong></p></blockquote></div><p>Please could you explain why? I thought if you used a single band router your speed gets cut in half regardless of how slow your connection would be because there is an extra hop?</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mk24 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Yes.&nbsp; Any dual band router running OpenWrt can do that.&nbsp; It does not need to be a model specifically sold as a &quot;repeater&quot;.</p></blockquote></div><p>I made a router recommendation thread because after scouring through the whole hardware supported list I could not find a router that met my criteria: forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=366723#p366723</p><p>Would appreciate your input.</p><p>Thanks again for the help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>openwrt_newbie999</strong> on 15 Oct 2017, 02:36)</p>
