					<p>Unless someone has actually tried, I&#039;m guessing it is next to impossible to tell from the binary (unless it contains debug strings which you can search). There were several threads last year on bluez and audio, but I don&#039;t remember any successes.<br />Is audio support in bluez-utils? <br />If it was my project, I would set up exigence and see what settings are &quot;default&quot; for a bluez build:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a></p>									</div>
