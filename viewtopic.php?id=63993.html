					<p>Friends, I&#039;d like to know if my WRT54GS2 ver.1 can be fixed, It worked until I tried to&nbsp; install Open firmware. </p><p>I tried something from YouTube to recover from the disaster to no avail, now when I plug the power to it the lights come on&nbsp; for a second then they all go off. <br />Sincerely XJohn</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Xjohndoe001x</strong> on 7 Apr 2016, 04:08)</p>

					<p>router only has a 2mb flash memory and it may not worth your time to trying to unbrick it.&nbsp; it works great with dd-wrt micro though but consider retiring the router and drop it off at your local recycling center.</p>									</div>

					<p>fair enough.&nbsp; if you really want to pursue this for educational and for experience, then my suggestion is for you to post your questions on the dd-wrt forum since your router is supported by dd-wrt micro.&nbsp; obviously your first attempt at this is to see if you can still ping the router so you can tftp with an original linksys firmware.&nbsp; if not, then you are looking at jtag.&nbsp; you should probably try a 30/30/30 reset if you have not done so.&nbsp; good luck on your educational journey.</p><p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT54G2_v1.3_%26_WRT54GS2_v1.0">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Li â€¦ 54GS2_v1.0</a></p>									</div>
