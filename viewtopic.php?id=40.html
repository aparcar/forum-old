					<p>How do you like the GS?&nbsp; What is the going price for one? I got two Gs now, maybe I can cluster them. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Also agree about the sourceforge, although is there a way to offer up direct downloads for the ipkg system rather than having to pick a download location like the usual sourceforge downloads?</p>									</div>

					<p>The packages generally have no source because it&#039;s just the stock program available on any number pf gpl mirrors. As we get further along expect to see scripts which download and build the ipkgs much like the current firmware sources.</p>									</div>

					<p>That would be a perfect solution for the time being. This is one of the things I really like about RPMs. A spec file contains all the information necessary to not only build the binary packages, but the source package as well (SRPM) that when installed has everything necessary to regenerate all the binary/source packages. But for these things a tar/gzip would be just fine. Probably just do a &quot;make clean&quot; after packaging up the binaries and then tar/gzip up the directory as Rod suggested. Might be able to put then in the same dir as the *.ipkg files named something like:</p><p>binary:<br />package-xx.ipkg<br />source:<br />package-xx.src.tgz</p><p>Again, just thinking out loud. It really only takes just a few more seconds of time.</p>									</div>
