					<p>It&#039;s been a few years since I&#039;ve been active in flashing firmware... so please forgive me if this topic has already been addressed... I could not find it.</p><p>In an attempt to save cellular data, I&#039;d like to build a mobile hotspot re-router... in effect, a wifi-to-wifi router with firmware that will seek and use public hotspots, then feed them to the users in my car... wife, kids, pets, then self.</p><p>I&#039;m a Comcast customer, and our town is flooded with public hotspots... including their residential Gateways that have public hotspots enabled.</p><p>I plan on using an external antenna (with gain) for the &quot;external&quot; connectivity, probably on a mag-mount. (2.4GHz only)</p><p>Is there such functionality in open-wrt/dd-wrt/other-wrt?</p><p>Comcast names all of their public hotspots &quot;xfinitywifi&quot;, and once you login to one (with your Comcast user creds), you auto-login to all.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I use DDWRT with a Linksys E2500 and a WRT54GS which both repeat the xfinitywifi perfectly. I&#039;m looking into openwrt atm because with ddwrt the 5ghz radio is disabled.</p>									</div>
