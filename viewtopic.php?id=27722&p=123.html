					<p>Ok, I tried to ping from the command line. I got no reply.</p><p>However, the modem light flashes during the ping.

This problem is a bit beyond my level of skills it seem. I quite accept even that the problem is my end, but just prior to install OpenWRT, I re-installed stock firmware and everything was OK and working, I used it to install OpenWRT, so why would it have stopped now?&nbsp; The firewall rules are supposed to work out of the box with this normal build, right. There are NO firewall rules currently implemented on my ws! I just don&#039;t know where or what to look for.&nbsp; It seems like sabotage, and I would think so if I was paranoid. LOL&nbsp; A leftover from my dd-wrt excursion, perhaps?&nbsp; LOL</p><p>Seriously. what steps do I need to take now to systematically research this issue? Please, bear in mid that I am NOT, not yet anyway, a network expert. So make the steps clear enough, with not too many assumptions about what I may or ought to know.</p><p>Thanks a ton.</p><p>PS, sorry I missed the bit about pinging from the router...&nbsp; I&#039;ll be back in ten minutes or so with that answer</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MidGe</strong> on 22 Jun 2012, 11:50)</p>

					<p>Ok, I tried pinging a known ip from the router and that fails. However, I noticed that the modem LAN light, the one connected to the router was flashing in sync with the pinging. So it seems that the problem is somewhere between the modem to external world to modem to router.</p><p>Could be the modem then? But I have never touched the modem, the connecting to the modem has been automagically made by the stock firmware or the dd-wrt firmware and I assume (uh! oh! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; ) the OpenWRT firmware???</p><p>If not so, I will have to dig up the modem manual (?) and what I need to do the modem?</p><p>Is that it?&nbsp; Does OpenWRT expect something from the modem, or does it responds and handle that itself?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey arokh, really enjoying your builds for over a year now. Just one thing is missing to me: As even the 5 GHz band is filling up here right now, I want to use the legally allowed channels 100-140 (I am located in the EU) but I can&#039;t since my WNDR3700 comes with 0x00 regulatory domain set in EEPROM. I can only use US channels (which are partly not allowed here) or less. Is there any chance that you provide a build with CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD=y or similar so I can set my region properly?</p><p>I tried to build your sources on my own but it seems to me that it does not work properly (&quot;make&quot; builds a 3700v2 image only and your build.sh script has some hardcoded directories so it does not work for me).</p><p>Hope you are willing to help! Thank you in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>e4865</strong> on 23 Jun 2012, 00:48)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve upgraded from some r31x build to r32498 and now I can&#039;t access my modem thru the router anymore. its an adsl2 pppoe connection, router IP 192.168.1.1, modem is 10.0.0.1. I&#039;ve set it up like its described in the wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/access.modem.through.nat#gui.version">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/acces … ui.version</a> and that used to work with the older build. any help?</p>									</div>

					<p>I tried serveral alternate builds on my 3700v1 and want to install kmod-macvlan. The module will not install because it&#039;s incompatible with the used kernel. The package installs ok on the normal build, but that one is too big because i need to install some extra packages for IPTV purposes. What can I do to install kmod-macvlan on the alternate build?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bibabart</strong> on 26 Jun 2012, 11:28)</p>

I don&#039;t really know what details you need to know but i&#039;ll try.. <br />the modem is in bridged mode, it runs a telnet server and a webinterface, and the router does the PPPoE stuff.

IP 10.0.0.2, subnet 255.255.255.0 in Interfaces - WAN in Luci<br />then i went to Firewall - Zone Settings - Zone &#039;wan&#039; - Advanced Settings and typed &#039;!modem&#039; in the &#039;Restrict Masquerading to given destination subnets&#039; field. <br />at the end I&#039;ve added these two lines in Firewall - Custom Rules<br /># modem<br />iptables -t nat -I postrouting_rule -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 10.0.0.1 -j SNAT --to 10.0.0.2<br />iptables -I zone_lan_forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 10.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT</p><p>however I can&#039;t even ping the modem at 10.0.0.1</p>									</div>
