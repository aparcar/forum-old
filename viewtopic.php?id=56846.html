					<p>Hi I downloaded the generic image and packages for RPi and uses OpenWRT to route traffic form a LAN connected to the built in ethernet port to the WAN side connected Davicom DM9601 USB Ethernet device (powered from an USB hub). Using LUCI to configure from the LAN side and pinging external hosts goes well. But as soon as the LAN client (an Ububuntu 14.04 HPProbook) accesses some other sites on the internet the crash is immediate. If some one is interested in the crash dump shown on the system console I might be able to make a photo before the reboot. Or if this is the wrong forum please route me in to the a more appropriate place.</p><p>[Added 15/4] Tested&nbsp; using the same USB Ethernet device but running with a TP-LINK WR703N running Attitude Adjustment and same additional kernel modules (though I ommited kmod-usb-net-cdc-ether) and I works like a dream, no kernel crashes.</p><p>This was the modules I added to the RPi to get the DM9601 up and running:<br />kmod-mii_3.10.49-1_brcm2708.ipk <br />kmod-usb-net-cdc-ether_3.10.49-1_brcm2708.ipk<br />kmod-usb-net-dm9601-ether_3.10.49-1_brcm2708.ipk <br />kmod-usb-net_3.10.49-1_brcm2708.ipk</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>8c2af462cf8b489b90d1a8e26</strong> on 15 Apr 2015, 21:58)</p>
