					<p>when i uploaded that&#039;s what it said&nbsp; failed in red&nbsp; and since other uploads did work and there was a notice about max 2MB i tought that was the cause.&nbsp; but if it works fine for you then it must be on my end.&nbsp; <br/>Just strange that that file kept failing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Would be nice to have the view/edit link listed. </p><p>What if the Model number of each device was linked to view/edit?&nbsp; Then there is no need to have an extra column for view/edit&nbsp; (and have the words view/edit as mouse over text when you hover over the model number)<br/>Or am i getting ahead of things? </p><p>Also, does anyone know if there is a &#039;SoC comparison database&#039; that lists all the SoC and their capabillities?</p><p>If not, would OpenWRT be the place for one?&nbsp; &nbsp;Not right now...&nbsp; </p><p>Then if someone needs a router with certain capabillities then he could first use the SoC table to filter out the SoC&#039;s that certainly can NOT meet the requirements, and then go to the ToH to compare the routers on hardware specs.&nbsp; <br/>Why a seperate database you might ask?<br/>Since devices don&#039;t use all the capabillities of SoCs.</p><p>Many SoCs have for instance I2S capabillities (that are hardly ever used) <br/>But in the ToH you can&#039;t find this.<br/>So if you then have a Database that has SoC data you can there look up i2S and see all the SoC&#039;s that have this. <br/>Say you need a SoC with I2S, I2C, ISP, MIMO 2:2x2, USB. then from those results you can filter the ToH and see all the models that use that most ideal SoC. </p><p>We could use data from the ToH to populate a basic Table for this?&nbsp; </p><p>Does this make sense, or might there be a better solution? (have this more integrated in the ToH maybe?)<br/>How could the devs use that data?<br/>What do basic users not want to see?<br/>How could router manufacturers &#039;use&#039; this data to decide what features the next generation should include.<br/>This so that manufactures can maybe find a niche market that has yet to be explored. And so they can &#039;capitalise&#039; on that.&nbsp; (Instead of blaming OpenSource to steal their market, they can provide hardware that the market is waiting for)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>*Cat with curiosity now tip-toes out of the room and hides around the corner*</p>									</div>

					<p>@tmo26 I can deal with the links being small, as I really do not need to read them.&nbsp; I do not want to see the font go smaller.&nbsp; One can (and I do) adjust the browser font when needed.&nbsp; </p><p>I have no problem with all the columns, as I have three monitors to stretch it across, but I know most folks do not.&nbsp; Fixing the scroll bar issue relative to the window as opposed to the frame would be BIG.&nbsp; I am guessing that it would have been done by know if it were easy.&nbsp; And please do not go back to the old solution of having the scroll bar every 30 or so lines.</p>									</div>
