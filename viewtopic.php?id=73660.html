					<p>The wiki also mentions this for your case:<br />If you successfully receive router bootup logs but seem unable to send data (e.g. some keyboard input which might be required to intercept bootup, and where you&#039;re unable to stop continued kernel bootup), then this may be due to having configured the connection as hardware flow control rather than software (happened on TL-WDR3600 in my case). </p><p>With some routers and some cables, people were successful when putting a pull-up resistor (between 2.2kOhms and 10kOhms) between the routers Rx and Vcc. This would boost the signal levels.</p><p>Also, a quick echo test of the cable could help to mitigate possible problems of the cable. Therefor, you would connect only your cables Tx to its Rx, nothing else. Then in your console program, disable local echo (meaning, that it should not print to screen which characters you send out; only output the data you receive) and type something. If your cable works, then you would see the characters you type in on screen.</p>									</div>
