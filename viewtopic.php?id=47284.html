					<p>For example :</p><p>the battery output should be live at all times. regardless of the input power state (assuming the battery has enough of a charge) the output power should be supplied uninterrupted, the charger (input) could be turned on and off (without disrupting the usb power output)</p><p>The battery I have ... anytime the power input is supplied, the power output goes out. When the input power is turned off and a usb device is plugged in (after the power input is already off) or the button is pressed on the unit ... only then will the power come on.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sfranzyshen</strong> on 11 Nov 2013, 23:06)</p>
