					<p>Hi,</p><p>I got a batman mesh network working fine on a 2.4ghz interface in adhoc mode.<br />Now i would like to configure the mesh network for my 5ghz interface.<br />Unfortunatly i figured out that my card doesn&#039;t seems to support the adhoc mode in 5ghz<br />Here is the output for the iw list command.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Supported interface modes:
         * managed
         * AP
         * AP/VLAN
         * monitor
         * mesh point</code></pre></div><p>I was able to configure the mesh network with the 5ghz interface in master mode so the bat0 interface could be associated with it, but it is not ideal.<br />In the supported interface modes there is the mesh point option, could it be used with the batman-adv protocol ? From the list above what is the best mode for running a mesh network without having a &quot;public&quot; network available ?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>In that capabilities list, I am pretty sure &quot;mesh point&quot; means that is supports IEEE802.11s mesh networking.</p><p>You could configure batman-adv to use an 802.11s interface, however that would be pretty much as klugey as forcing batman-adv to work with a &quot;master&quot; mode interface like you have already done.&nbsp; Perhaps *slightly* more useful, in that the 802.11s mesh would be more flexible configuration-wise than you having to set up AP/STA links, though still pretty klugey.&nbsp; Essentially, you&#039;d have batman-adv mesh network on 2.4GHz, and having batman-adv essentially act as a bridge to a separate 802.11s mesh on 5GHz.&nbsp; It would probably work (though there might be some perverse interactions between 802.11s and batman-adv which might bring the whole thing down), but even if it does work it&#039;ll still be pretty klugey.</p><p>I have to say I am pretty surprised that your wireless card driver does not support &quot;adhoc&quot;, I assumed that it ought to be supported by virtually any chipset there....?&nbsp; Guess I am wrong!</p>									</div>
