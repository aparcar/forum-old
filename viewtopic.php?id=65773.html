					<p>I installed a new firmware on my router but forgot to include Luci to the configurations in Openwrt. My router does not have internet connection, so i am not able to install the required packages. Is it possible to download them on my VM, transfer them (maybe via &quot;scp&quot;) to the router and then install them so i can reach my router via ip on my browser?</p>									</div>

					<p>@jsj: scp (typically &quot;scp /path/to/package.ipk root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/package.ipk&quot;) or if you use windows you can use either pscp (from putty) or winscp (with a GUI) will allow you to transfer data from your computer to the router, as long as you can reach the router over the local network.

					<p>Thank you both very much. I think I got that point with the scp command and how it should work. But now my problem is that I dont know witch package is the right one.

					<p>Lets ask the question a different way.&nbsp; Do you know what the web link was that you used to download your files from?&nbsp; <br />If you used this link it is DD:&nbsp; <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/latest/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/latest/</a><br />If you used DD then you may or may not be able to install Luci as the NOW current version may not be the needed one.&nbsp; There is little or no harm in trying.&nbsp; You will get a message telling you there is an error, typically a kernel error.&nbsp; </p><p>Probably would not hurt for you to tell us exactly what hardware you are using.</p><p>Here are 2 links to information on Luci<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials</a> - Scroll down to the section &quot;minimalistic offline installation&quot;.&nbsp; There is a set of packages you need for luci, it&#039;s not just one, but not all either.&nbsp; About a dozen.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/start?do=search&amp;id=luci">https://wiki.openwrt.org/start?do=search&amp;id=luci</a> - This is the general wiki link to all Luci pages.</p><p>It would be much easier to connect you router and do this.&nbsp; Supporting files will be installed automatically.</p>									</div>
