					<p>hi guys.i need a budget vpn router.my actual router is a gl-inet mt300a ( same hardware as the linksys ea6100) it is a good nano rouer but it cant put out more than 13Mbit on vpn.as far as i know cpu is important for vpn right?so maybe its 500MHz cpu is weak.i looked arond and i found that the e4200v2 / ea4500 has 1.2Ghz cpu for good price.the next linksys with decent cpu is the ea8xxx series which i cant afford.so the e4200v2 / ea4500 is a good choice for vpn?or any other brand router with about the same specs / price?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>None of the consumer routers have the CPU power or memory of a PC, and very few have HW encryption (AES) which is probably the key to performance.&nbsp; Consumer routers rely on SW encryption mostly.</p><p>You should be more explicit about your speed expectations, price and usage scenario.</p>									</div>
