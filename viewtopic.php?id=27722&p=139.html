Because this is trunk build, if anything in the kernel changes ( in this case kmod-fuse ) you cannot upgrade these.. These kernel modules are built with your linux kernel ( in this case lower than 3.6.8-1-b22.... ). The package you try to install is built with a newer kernel and not compatible with yours. You need to find a version with your kernel and use that.. If you installed recently you can find the package already compiled with your build. You can download and install it via opkg.</p>									</div>

In practice you need to install such kernel add-on modules that have been compiled at the same time as the kernel itself. Otherwise you get a checksum error. It is not about newer/older, as the kernel checksum is a normal md5sum.</p><p>You can circumvent the restriction by &quot;opkg install --force-depends&quot;, which make opkg to bypass the checksum requirement. That may work, if the modules are for the same kernel version. But it may also cause unstability for the system, if there is some actual difference between the kernel options of the versions. see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/opkg#options">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/opkg#options</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 7 Dec 2012, 12:10)</p>

So the build was fine after all!</p><p>I also spent a lot of time finding the cause why my router had errors at the system tab and had lost all configuration changes after reboot. It appeared I had 2 problems: the image was too large, so the jffs overlay did not mount (so config was on volatile memory). Number 2 was a type in my predefined config that crashed Luci on the system tab.</p><p>My build is now simple and stable based of both the config of arokh and the latest attitude adjust release.<br />This is what I would like to work towards:</p><ul><li><p>stay close to the stable attitude adjust sources and first fix instabilities before experimenting with features. Tag stable releases</p></li><li><p>a stable build that has all basic router functionality on board (openvpn, l2tp, IP4, IP6, shaping, etc).</p></li><li><p>a build that works out of the box (like arokh did, wireless available for easy config, most work is done already!) Just restore personal configuration using Luci and off go!</p></li><li><p>which works well with USB-overlay so anybody can install it&#039;s desired custom packages</p></li><li><p>all changes at least a *bit* documented (why the change?)</p></li><li><p>optimised for speed and size (and tx-power/CRDA-reg settings, will look into it once more, to really confirm it doesn&#039;t work)</p></li><li><p>predefined firewall rules for VPN etc ready to activate.</p></li><li><p>preconfigured zones: public, lan, wan, vpn</p></li><li><p>dnsmasq configured with dnsmasq.d directory &amp; ad banning includes</p></li></ul><p>Add ons:<br /></p><ul><li><p>I made a public hotspot using lua (a separate zone, dnsmasq script to trigger generation of a ticket, lua for web interface, iptables for redirects and blocking, etc) - I want to make it a package.</p></li><li><p>I want to use iptable rules to account certain traffic (lua script, web interface, + simple iptables &quot;--comment&quot; rules = nihil cpu) E.g. account for all news traffic = iptables </p></li></ul><p>I personally do like accessing the router with samba, so if size allows it I will include a (minimal?) samba. (I believe arokh did some crunching excluding nmbd)</p><p>I want to look into the solution of upgrading an USB-overlayed router when a new kernel is used; currently the overlay is switched off automatically and all packages must be removed and reinstalled manually. I would like that scripted. </p><p>I am now looking into the required modules for IPTABLES to get firewall rule&quot;L2TP ESP&quot; working:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;rule&#039;

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Correcting power levels a definite NO-NO for the WNDR3700...</p><p>Since the router is limited to lower txpower and less frequencies than is allowed in my country, I tried (once more, sigh) to improve the router&#039;s performance. Note that my router has the Atheros custom WOR0_WORLD = 0x60 World domain in EEPROM (dmesg: &quot;ath: EEPROM regdomain: 0x60&quot;) and not the American 00-domain.</p><ul><li><p>I read 1 million posts about crda, regulatory.bin, openwrt &amp; wndr3700 - some claim success some not</p></li><li><p>I rebuilt regulatory.bin, with a customised db.txt</p></li><li><p>I enabled the kernel option CONFIG_ATH_USER_REGD</p></li><li><p>I fiddled in &quot;regd.c&quot; to ensure that the effect of &quot;404-ath_regd_optional.patch&quot; was present</p></li></ul><p>The good:<br /></p><ul><li><p>It is possible to use more frequencies on both 2.4 and 5ghz</p></li></ul><p>The bad:<br /></p><ul><li><p>&quot;iw list&quot; shows more frequency options, but eg. 2.4 except ch 14 stay all limited to 17 dbm.</p></li><li><p>I cannot get power levels over 17mdb (on 2.4 band), even if I can get the router to accept the values, the effect seems none (monitoring with inSSIDer)</p></li></ul><p>The odd:<br /></p><ul><li><p>My self-signed regulatory.bin is not accepted by regdbdump: &quot;Database signature verification failed.&quot;, but neither is any of the &#039;fixed&#039; regulatory.bin files found on the internet.</p></li><li><p>The router accepts my change on the &#039;00&#039; region, dmesg reads &quot;World regulatory domain updated:&quot; and reads back the settings I provided in the db.txt (no nagging on signatures or anything.</p></li><li><p>When selecting region &#039;00&#039; as the region the router allows some more settings as described above &quot;the good&quot;</p></li><li><p>Selecting my own (or any other modified country (with identical settings as the world region), reads back the old region settings, that were NOT in my db.txt file (what the f...!?)</p></li></ul><p>I also read a post with a (dead) link to the FCC-report that concluded that to power of the device is in fact (too) limited.</p><p>So, I think there is nobody that can actually confirm improvements. I probably also did some things wrong.<br />Too bad. Case closed. On with more useful things.</p><p>TeeZee</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TeeZee</strong> on 13 Dec 2012, 10:20)</p>

(maybe it works, but not on all harware)<br />-Do you use the regulatory.bin provided with your build for the above results? (ie how come it doesn&#039;t work for me)<br />-Does your build check for proper signatures of the .bin? (ie will a regulatory with failing &quot;regdbdump&quot; fail)</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TeeZee</strong> on 14 Dec 2012, 23:53)</p>
