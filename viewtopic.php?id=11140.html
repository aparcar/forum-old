					<p>I spent a while debugging why WDS was not working before stumbling on this:</p><p>I had noticed after upgrading one end of a WDS pair, a WRT54GS from (blech) DD-WRT to Kamikaze<br />brcm-2.4 7.06&nbsp; that well.... WDS no longer worked.&nbsp; After some fiddling first thing I noticed was that<br />the MAC address of my wl0 interface was now same as nvram get il0macaddr<br />00:90:4c:5f:00:2a</p><p>I poked for a while trying to find an option for /etc/config/wireless to set the MAC, nothing.<br />Finally I set nvram il0macaddress to the value I knew it to be previously (looked at WDS setting<br />on it&#039;s partner) and everything worked.&nbsp; &nbsp;This seem wrong but it fixed my immediate problem<br />and got my link back up again. Phew!</p><p>Question is what SHOULD I have done?</p><p>And why is that every Linksys router I check seems to have this variable set to same value?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 12 Jun 2007, 10:54)</p>

					<p>No I did not erase nvram between flashing.</p><p>So are you saying changing il0macaddr is inappropriate or dangerous?</p><p>Would be interesting to see value of a unit freshly flashed from Linksy factory firmware.&nbsp; &nbsp;I only have older WRT around at the moment that have been total sluts and had many firmware, no virgin units.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmm... I got that exact default value for il0macaddr when I erased nvram and rebooted into Kamikaze 7.06 image.&nbsp; The CFE loads up a bunch of default values.&nbsp; I did this a lot with Whiterussian and il0macaddr always ended up as et0macaddr +2.</p><p>Do you have et0macaddr set?&nbsp; Normal (Whiterussian, DD-WRT on CFE defaulted nvram):<br />et0macaddr=00:14:BF:xx:xx:49<br />il0macaddr=00:14:bf:xx:xx:4b</p><p>To support where I&#039;m coming from, here&#039;s the values extracted from the CFE nvram area:<br />et0macaddr=00:90:4C:60:00:2A<br />il0macaddr=00:90:4c:5f:00:2a</p><p>I like this technique to get cfe defaults:<br />dd if=/dev/mtdblock/0 bs=1 skip=4116 count=2048 | strings &gt; /tmp/cfe.txt</p><p>What can it be but Whiterussian and DD-WRT corrected il0macaddr but Kamikaze did not?&nbsp; You may have triggered CFE to do this by some other means.&nbsp; Just speculating.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what exact situation triggers CFE to write values.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bill_MI</strong> on 13 Jun 2007, 04:26)</p>

					<p>The more I think about it, this is one of those grey areas between KAMIKAZE DOES NOT USE NVRAM and reality.&nbsp; The reality is there are some things you have to read from nvram on a Broadcom device. In this case it looks like that something is the MAC.</p><p>You can generate a custom CFE with the corrected default value, so in case NVRAM ever gets cleared it gets reset again correctly.</p><p>Alternatively if you don&#039;t mess with CFE, I would write a boot-script to check that value and correct it if it goes back to defaults.</p><p>Both answers do not seem elegant though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 22 Jun 2007, 03:21)</p>
