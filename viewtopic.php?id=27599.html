					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I&#039;m very tempted by the Routerboard Pro - I kinda figure that spending the extra money on this should get me decent &quot;future-proofing&quot; and longer-term support. Obviously the question of what hardware is &quot;recommended&quot; or &quot;the best&quot; comes up often because the options are constantly changing or improving.</p><p>Having said that, wifi performance isn&#039;t that important to me - I started out planning an 802.11g base-station, and only now consider 802.11n because of feature-creep and because there are some N cards that aren&#039;t that much more expensive than 54G.<br />Reliability, compatibility and stable drivers, on the other hand, are <em>very</em> important to me.</p><p>So, anyway, <strong>Mikrotik make a bunch of Atheros &quot;R52&quot; cards. Are these a good option?</strong></p><p>Is there any reason to buy the R52HN high-power version, over the R52N-m? Both use the AR9220 chipset - the R52HN is a bit more expensive, but it seems to use a lot more power and give only a couple of dB better performance.<br /><a href="http://www.wifi-stock.co.uk/file/R52n-M.pdf">http://www.wifi-stock.co.uk/file/R52n-M.pdf</a><br /><a href="http://www.wifi-stock.co.uk/file/R52Hn.pdf">http://www.wifi-stock.co.uk/file/R52Hn.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23983">Another post a few months ago</a> suggested some <strong>Sparklan Atheros cards</strong> - the <a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/p243/SparkLAN-WMIA-198N-High-Power-20dbm-(100mW)-Wireless-Mini-PCI-Atheros-AR9002-(MB93,-chipset-AR9220)-WiFi-Dual-Band-adapter-802.11a/b/g/n-up-to-300Mbps---integrators-only/product_info.html">WMIA-198n</a> and <a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/p127/SparkLAN-WMIA-199N-WLAN-802.11n-draft-wifi-2.4/5Ghz-dual-band-3T/3R-Module-(Atheros-AR9001-AR9160-XSPAN)-Wireless-miniPCI-card/product_info.html">WMIA-199n</a>, and mentioned the supplier Oxfordtec.com - Oxfordtec actually have <a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/MiniPCI-Wireless-Cards-802.11n---300Mbps/c36_40/index.html">a whole bunch of Atheros Sparklan N cards</a>, including the <a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/p138/SparkLAN-WMIA-207GN-WLAN-802.11n-draft-wifi-Mini-PCI-2T/3R-Module(-Atheros-AR5008-3NX-AR5416-XSPAN-chipset)-Wireless-miniPCI-card/product_info.html">WMIA-207GN</a>, the <a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/p228/SparkLAN-WMIA-209GN-High-Power-20dbm-(100mW)-Wireless-Mini-PCI-Atheros-AR9002-(MB93,-chipset-AR9223)-WiFi-adapter-802.11b/g/n-up-to-300Mbps---integrators-only/product_info.html">WMIA-209GN</a> and the <a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/p150/SparkLAN-WMIA-268N-WLAN-802.11n-draft-2.0-wifi-2.4/5Ghz-dual-band-3T/3R-Module-(Atheros-AR9001-3NX-AR9160-XSPAN)-Wireless-miniPCI-card/product_info.html">WMIA-268N</a>.</p><p>They mostly all look the same to me. I like the idea of &quot;utilizes Adaptive Radio to automatically identify clear channels for maximum throughout&quot; (<a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/p150/SparkLAN-WMIA-268N-WLAN-802.11n-draft-2.0-wifi-2.4/5Ghz-dual-band-3T/3R-Module-(Atheros-AR9001-3NX-AR9160-XSPAN)-Wireless-miniPCI-card/product_info.html">WMIA-268N</a>), but I kinda feel reluctant to trust manufacturer&#039;s claims. That card seems to say it&#039;s Linux-compatible &quot;after TSA signed&quot; - what the heck does that mean? Some of these cards - such as the <a href="http://www.oxfordtec.com/uk/p127/SparkLAN-WMIA-199N-WLAN-802.11n-draft-wifi-2.4/5Ghz-dual-band-3T/3R-Module-(Atheros-AR9001-AR9160-XSPAN)-Wireless-miniPCI-card/product_info.html">WMIA-199n</a> that <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23983">robrob originally recommended</a> is marked by Oxfordtec as &quot;integrators only&quot; - is there any good reason for this?</p><p><strong>Should I care about MIMO - 2x2, 3x3 or otherwise? Do people find this makes a big difference?</strong></p><p><strong>Aerials</strong> - in the IRC channel this week I have heard that single-channel aerials are often better quality than dual-channel ones, so I thought about something like <a href="http://www.interprojekt.com.pl/tplink-tlant2408cl-24ghz-8dbi-indoor-omni-antenna-p-921.html">this 2.4ghz 8dBi aerial</a>. Obviously I want &quot;the more dee-bees&quot;, and I really don&#039;t need 802.11a or multi-channel capabilities. Then someone else, conversely and anecdotally, said that they upgraded to higher dB aerial and got worse reception; it was suggested that maybe this was because the better performance allowed one to receive the interference of more distant neighbours&#039; networks. I wonder if I&#039;m over-thinking it, and should just go for some <a href="http://www.wifi-stock.co.uk/details/ac_swi_mmcx.html">simple short 2dB antennae</a>. I admittedly don&#039;t need that much range, and I do live in the middle of town, with lots of neighbours, all of whom have wifi.</p><p>So this has turned into a much bigger shower of questions than I had planned. There&#039;s kinda a part of my that wants to be slapped for making this so complicated - at the beginning of this week I started reading the OpenWRT site only thinking &quot;is there something more suitable than this original WRT54G that I&#039;m thinking of using for this project?&quot; A <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH</a> would be about half the price of the Routerboard Pro, and it <em>is</em> a very good little router, but it would has only about half the RAM and 60% the CPU mhz, and I&#039;m suffering from this old-fasioned &quot;buy the best you can afford and it&#039;ll last you&quot; philosophy.</p><p>Any thoughts, comments or discussion gratefully received.</p><p>Stroller.</p>									</div>

					<p>Strolls,</p><p>I just realized all my Atheros/Kamikaze access points are running in 11g, not 11n mode because of instability.

					<p>I have a R52n running on routerstation pro (11na HT40) and there were a lot of problems and instablities, but since some time (1-2 month) backfire is quite stable (I build everything from svn) but I guess the lastest 10.3.1 release candidate should work fine. I use a second wificard, but I don&#039;t&nbsp; remember which brand (gerneric 23dBm atheros 11g-card) for compabilitiy with my mobile, and old laptops. </p><p>I use the R52n with this antennas: <a href="http://www.joymax.com.tw/E/product-show/cid-18--pid-190.html">http://www.joymax.com.tw/E/product-show … d-190.html</a><br />And I would recommend to get the R52Hn if you want to use 11na on 5GHz because the maxium txpower drops on higher MCS (MCS7 HT40 only 13dBm) so you get only real 11n-speed in the same room, because 5GHz signals don&#039;t like walls!&nbsp; In the same room I get 10-15MByte/s, after one medium-thick wall I get a quite good connection 8-12MByte/s, after another thin wall only 5-8MByte/s but stable, and after another thin wall, no stable signal. The signal of the 11g card with 23dBm is still quite good/stable there.<br />The R52Hn has 17dBm at MCS7 HT40 and 4 dBi more are a lot. <br />So if you have some walls where the signal should get through get the 52Hn. If you don&#039;t want to use the 5Ghz band there is one need to get an 11na card. Then get something cheaper.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 9 Dec 2010, 21:06)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m sure we&#039;re much alike, Rob - if I were sure the performance of the RouterStation was going to hold up to the price then I&#039;d have no hesitation. Were I not in a slight recession at the moment I would possibly buy one of each and thoroughly field-test them. That would get me the satisfaction of knowing for sure and a spare router can always be sold on eBay. But as well as the money I have so many projects placing demands on my time at the moment; I&#039;ll sleep on it for another day or two, but I&#039;m inclined to go for the Buffalo.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Strolls</strong> on 10 Dec 2010, 13:59)</p>

					<p>Don&#039;t mean to unbury the thread but wanted to thank you guys for the discussion here - I picked up a RouterStation Pro about a month back, and just now pulled the trigger on two WMIA-199N cards with a smattering of 7dBi antennas (all from oxfordtec). I&#039;m completely impressed by the RSPro by itself and looking forward to seeing what it can do with some halfway serious radios in it.</p><p>If you guys run across this thread again - can you detail your current OpenWrt build? (Backfire/Attitude Adjustment yet? Or still Kamikaze?) Do you run 5GHz, does it work okay? 802.11n?</p><p>On another thread I saw discussion regarding the Ubiquiti radios and have to agree, the price doesn&#039;t seem to justify what&#039;s going on there. $59US versus $139US (SR-71A), that&#039;s kinda nuts.</p><p>Anyhow. Once the gear shows up I&#039;ll show and tell. The RSPro currently lives in my basement in a 12U wallmount rack, and the antennas will be going in the ceiling. I&#039;ve got about 3500-4000sq ft to cover, so there may be a need to run antennas outside or something, we&#039;ll see.</p>									</div>

I found anything under RC4 to be pretty unstable using N. I have a UBNT SR71-A radio had from Xagyl.com for under $100 CAD. Waiting patiently for RC5 and have thought about loading up from SVN but it seems RC5 is but a few days away. The max I have hit using a Intel 6300 Ultimate N client with a 5ghz config was 21MB a second LAN to wireless win7 transfer.</p>									</div>
