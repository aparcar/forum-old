					<p>I have Verizon’s FIOS internet + TV and would like to daisy chain my WRTSL54GS to the Verizon provided Actiontec router using the SL54’s WAN port. I have read the wiki on how to configure the WAN port as a LAN port and have no problem doing that. My question is do I need to configure anything else to have my WRT54SLGS to act as a switch like possibly turning of NAT etc?</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Andy</p>									</div>
