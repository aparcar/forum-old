					<p>Hi I have problems with my internet connection being lost every now and then.<br />this is an issue with my ISP and they should have fixed it.<br />unfortunately I now noticed it&#039;s still happening.<br />I was wondering if I have some way of monitoring and logging these events so I know for sure when my ISP manages to successfully fixes the problem.</p>									</div>

					<p>I use this script for the same purpose. (and I did use it before as keepalive/autoreconnect script for vpnc on openwrt). It checks every 5 seconds if it can ping host1 or host2. if it can ping at least one of them everything is fine and it logs &quot;alive ...&quot; in the logfile, of none of the two hosts is reachable it logs &quot;Not alive ....&quot; in the logfile<br />You might want to increase the 5 sec. I use this quite short intervall because my isp (modem) loses the connection sometimes, and reconnects after 10 sec. So I need a short intervall to get it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
