					<p>Thank you all for replying my last post several months ago. Now I got a new problem...I compiled the firmware and wanted to use IPv6 private BT with this router. BUT when I ping IPv6, all I get is &quot;ping: send to: Operation not permitted&quot; thing. I suppose that&#039;s some kind of iptable problem or kernel bugs? Google didn&#039;t solve my problem. I can ping 0::0 and other IPv6 loopback addresses but other v6 addresses will cause that message. That&#039;s weird... IPv4 works all fine...Please help...<br />Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am new to this world of 3rd party firmware. Today i tried to flash my new DIR-505 a1 with latest from trunk (downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-505-a1-squashfs-factory.bin). I am running router in repeater mode and was connected with ethernet while upgrading. Upgrade went successful and router re-booted. Post reboot, i got a blinking red and now a blinking green light. I tried to telnet 196.168.1.1 but was not able to telnet.</p><p>If i remove USB, there is no light in router. I tried to unplug and then connect again after few minutes but same result. I have set my windows(7) TCP/IP properties for IPV4 to assign static IP as well. Please help me!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sachin0235</strong> on 19 Oct 2013, 19:20)</p>
