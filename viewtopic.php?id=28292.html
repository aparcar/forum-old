					<p>Hi damex,<br />Have you seen an answer to my questions in the topic you listed? I&#039;m not, too. So I&#039;m a little be angry. Someone posts that the Rev. B works and then we got no answer to questions when it&#039;s not working.... :-(</p><p>I think you should not use a DIR-300 Rev. B. My one only talks to me via serial port after flashing. I&#039;m interested to hear something from the person how told that it works, but no answer. Someone should delete his hint that it works...</p><p>A german computer magazin (c&#039;t 3/11 Page 156) has written that openWRT works with the B Version. I have mailed to the author of the article to tell me how he got the Rev. B working.<br />If I got an answer, I&#039;ll post it here.&nbsp; </p><p>BR schmelle2</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi damex,<br />the author of the article told that he had successfully running DD-WRT on his DIR-300 Rev. B router.<br />At the moment he&#039;s trying to get OpenWRT up and running. The first points he found out was that the bridge- and the sw-config tools are not automatically marked using make menuconfig.</p><p>BR schmelle2</p><p>P.S. If I got further answer I&#039;ll post it here.</p>									</div>
