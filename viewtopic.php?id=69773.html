					<p>Hi, </p><p>I have noticed nmap does not do reverse DNS lookup if I unplug and re plug the Ethernet cable to my Openwrt router while the router is still on. I then have to do /etc/init.d/network restart to get reverse dns lookup to work again. Anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening and how I can prevent this behavior without restarting the network?</p><p>Sort of unrelated, but I have also noticed nmap only does reverse dns lookup on 1 out of 3 networks I have tested on. Any ideas on why it only works on certain networks?</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>supergeen</strong> on 9 Feb 2017, 20:17)</p>
