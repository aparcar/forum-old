					<p>we&#039;re trying to do video streaming over WLAN using a Linksys WRT54GS w/ Whiterussian rc2 as access point; unfortunately it seems to drop a load of packets.</p><p>We&#039;re using vlc (http://www.videolan.org/) on both the client and server side, broadcasting a 512 kBit/s video stream along with a 64 kBit/s MP3 audio stream, to multicast IP 239.255.0.1.<br />(Command line on the server side:<br />vlc --intf dummy video.mpg --sout &#039;#transcode{venc=ffmpeg,vcodec=mp4v,acodec=mp3,vb=512,ab=64,deinterlace,width=360,height=288}:standard{access=udp,mux=ts,url=239.255.0.1,sap,name=&quot;test&quot;}&#039;<br />Command line on the client side:<br />vlc udp:@239.255.0.1)</p><p>Our server and client setup is probably OK, the same configuration works perfectly if I replace the router with an old Zyxel Prestige 650HW-31.</p><p>&quot;wl mrate 11&quot; doesn&#039;t help.</p><p>Is there anything needed to support multicasts on openwrt that I&#039;m overlooking?</p>									</div>

					<p>I also noticed that video streaming does not work through openwrt wifi (haven&#039;t tested other routers or acces point...)<br />Even with unicast, this does not work, I think the only reason is that a lot of packets are dropped, and video streaming does not support at all packet drops because it uses udp.</p><p>I think there is a huge bug in the ethernet bridge, maybe the flow control does not work, something like that. This seems a difficult thing to debug.</p><p>The first step I think is to use a tool like iperf and test udp bandwidth&nbsp; wlan &lt;&gt; router &lt;&gt; lan then test also with iperf lan&lt;&gt;wlan.<br />iperf can tell about bandwidth and packet drops. Have to find iperf for openwrt...</p><p>I&#039;ll give it a try when I have some time.</p>									</div>

					<p>haven&#039;t had time to do any iperf tests yet. But there are probably packet drops problems even with tcp.<br />I use whiterussian rc2 as an access point (2 asus wl500gdeluxes).<br />When I watch a divx through samba and wifi, I have some freezes which I don&#039;t have through lan to lan.</p><p>I&#039;ve read in the wl500g.info forums that packet drops bug have been corrected in the asus firmware. <br />Do you think openwrt suffers from the same bug the asus firmware had?</p><p>Any one experiencing packet drops? These are only visible with real time traffic...</p>									</div>

					<p>ok I found libstdc++ on florian</p><p>it look like the wlan drops about 1 to 2% of packets between linux on lan and windows on wifi through openwrt.<br />I use iperf with udp at 1mbit/s. The windows box is connected to an asuswl500dg with original firmware in client mode.</p><p>there is no packet drop between lan and router.</p><p>still have to measure packet drops between router and wlan, and linux lan to windows lan.</p><p>the tcp performance is about 22 mbit/s unidirectionnal, 14+7 mbit/s bidirectionnal</p><p>Can&#039;t say if packet loss is a software bug or due to hardware.</p>									</div>
