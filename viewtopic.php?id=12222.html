					<p>I bought a fonera+ router and now I&#039;m wondering if I can flash it. The problem that I want to solve is that I need to use it as an access point disabling the routing mode. At my place I already have a wired network and so I need both wan and lan ports in order to put the AP between the router and one of the clients, I have to use the 2 ports of la FONERA+ as a switch. is it clear?<br />I just want to create a wireless access point that makes me connect to my old network and let me connect to the others pc on the old network.<br />can someone help me?</p>									</div>

					<p>A simple search of fonera in this forum shows that yes, you probably can install OpenWRT on it, at least on a non + model. In fact, there seems to be so may results on it, that I suspect you may not be too proficient on the subject, in which case it may not be the best solution to be the first one to attempt it with a new model.</p><p>However, I suspect that you do not need to. If all you are trying to do is to extent your existing wired lan with an AP for simple wireless internet access, and sign in to FON, you probably only need to plug in the fonera <strong>WAN</strong> into one of your normal network ports, as if it is a client. </p><p>You certainly do not need to put it between an existing client and the network.</p><p>There may be some issues with PvP games because of the &#039;router-behind-a-router&#039; setup, but WWW should work, as does eMail, and also your FON login and sharing should work.

					<p>Well, it is flash-able, in fact, it is simply listed as number 27 in the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">hardware table</a>, had you tried searching a little bit, with a set of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Fon/Fonera">instructions</a>.</p><p>But if you do put OpenWRT on it, it will no longer be a FON router...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cybermaus</strong> on 25 Aug 2007, 00:38)</p>
