My reason is simple - my clients are tunneled, vlaned, natted, and firewalled and simply not accessible via telnet from anything but the lan ports. I leave them with no PW set because if I need to make a housecall I don&#039;t want to have to carry along a disk with Putty! But with RC4 this leaves me no option to turn on the webif as this disables telent. Well, actually I can put telnet back in, but that&#039;s an extra config step from an otherwise very simple setup.</p><p>Actually, it&#039;s probably trivial to re-activate telnet - I&#039;ll research a bit.</p><p>- DL</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dl</strong> on 20 Dec 2005, 12:23)</p>

					<p>Perhaps it would be better if telnet were disabled entirely by default.

					<p>I&#039;m sorry if that post came across as arrogant - it wasn&#039;t intended to.</p><p>The point I was trying to make is: some people have a misconception that ssh is hard. They see the word &quot;cryptography&quot; and panic.</p><p>The reality is that having an ssh client under Windows is really, really, really easy. Honestly. Download putty; double click on it; the end. It couldn&#039;t possibly be any easier. On the other hand, using telnet for device administration puts you at a <em>real</em> risk - especially if your packets are going over a wireless interface.</p><p>Of course, a project like OpenWRT has to address the needs of its userbase. There may be users for whom having telnet access is more convenient, and having it meets their needs better, as expressed by some people above. We can try to educate them that actually ssh will almost certainly meet their needs just as well, but if that&#039;s really not the case for those people then there&#039;s no problem; OpenWRT provides telnet after all.</p><p>Now, if there are users who say &quot;I want to use telnet, but I also want to password-protect my telnet session, even though I&#039;m perfectly aware that my password is sniffable and therefore it&#039;s almost pointless using passwords with telnet&quot;, then I think OpenWRT can meet their needs too; I expect they just need to tweak the busybox configuration and away they go.</p><p>So, given that OpenWRT can do all this, the only argument really is about what the <em>default</em> configuration is. Personally I would prefer the default configuration to be &quot;secure&quot;. There has been a big shift in this direction in the rest of the Linux world; a few years ago all distributions shipped with dozens of daemons turned on by default. This represented a large number of possible vulnerabilities. The shift has now been towards having only the minimum enabled, and the user having to enable all services explicitly. For those diehards who say &quot;ugh, I can&#039;t administer my newly-installed Linux box because telnet is disabled&quot;, they just have to enable telnet themselves (and accept the consequences); this is a lot better than the rest of us having to remember to <em>disable</em> telnet on every machine we install, because (a) it&#039;s more work for the majority, and (b) it&#039;s a step which can be easily be forgotten.</p><p>Im summary: IMO the majority will want to use ssh and will not want insecure services like telnet enabled. It seems reasonable to me that the default configuration should aim to minimise the amount of changes required by the majority of users.</p><p>As for running Windows on your wireless router: perhaps someone at Microsoft with a few spare hours on their hands could take the PocketPC source code and port it? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>you can keep telnet enabled even after you set a password with a simple setting in you sysconf file. openwrt is fully customizable, so how can you complain? i just started and am dealing with linux for the first time, and i dont see how&nbsp; what you are suggesting makes it easier for you. its self-centered for you to ask for the default setup to be plug n&#039; play and cater to your needs, especially when no one is saying that you cant custom build your own</p>									</div>

Webif isn&#039;t the only thing I would have left out of the base build.

Passwordless ssh makes it just as obvious that you are insecure as passwordless telnet. start with ssh, and make telnet an ipkg to save us from the evils of bloated firmware!! ;P (in all seriousness, this isn&#039;t a terrible idea. maybe there could be a change to the banner if the password isn&#039;t set with a big warning &quot;YOU HAVE NOT SET A PASSWORD. THIS LEAVES YOU VULNERABLE&quot; or some such.</p><p>But yea, I don&#039;t understand this &quot;telnet is harder than ssh&quot; thing. The login commands are largely the same. The interface is the same (a shell). I don&#039;t understand the big deal, nor why you can use telnet in an environment but not ssh.</p>									</div>
