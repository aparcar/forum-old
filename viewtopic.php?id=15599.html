					<p>PHP5-cli provides a date not adjusted for the time zone running under openWrt Kamikazi 7.09 on an NSLU2.&nbsp; PHP5-cli was installed with ipkg install php5-cli (after the NSLU2 openwrt ipkg feeds were enabled).&nbsp; The NSLU2 is set up with a ntpclient running hourly and a /etc/TZ value of EST5DST.&nbsp; The system responds to the date command with the proper local time, but the php code in testdate.php (shown below) does not--it shows Greenwich time, 4 hours later relative to Daylight Savings Time.&nbsp; This code gives the expected response on an XP machine. Where should this issue be brought up to try to seek a resolution? </p><p># date<br />Thu May&nbsp; 8 17:10:09 EDT 2008<br /># /usr/bin/php-cli testdate.php<br />08-05-08 9:10pm</p><p>-- testdate.php --<br />&lt;?php<br />echo date(&quot;y-m-d g:ia&quot;);<br />?&gt;</p>									</div>
