					<p>If I understood correctly, problems arise when you use the router as a DNS, and your OpenWRT uses the router as a DNS because it is configured as a DHCP client, right? I guess your OpenWRT box has problems when resolving domain names, too.</p><p>Have you tried to just force your OpenWRT box to use Google&#039;s DNSs for itself, despite whatever the router says? You keep your OpenWRT box as a caching nameserver for your clients, and you also solve the issue for the OpenWRT box.</p><p>(I know I am diverting from your original question, hope you do not mind)</p><p><em>Edited after rereading previous post.</em></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eduperez</strong> on 15 Jan 2015, 17:11)</p>
