					<p>This message is a follow-on from previous post &quot;Where do people mount their external storage?&quot; to discuss a method to overcome my problems outlined in that post.</p><p>I have started thinking about the need for anything in /usr on the flash filesystem. There seems to be little point to differentiate /bin and /usr/bin, for example, on the built-in flash. Why not just put everything in /bin, /sbin, /lib and ignore /usr altogether for the internal flash filesystem?</p><p>One way to do this would be to have ipk files built to install everything in /usr (i.e. if the package is selected as &lt;M&gt; in the config). That way any software loaded onto the &quot;image&quot; can go onto another storage device. I do understand that the flash root filesystem is built from ipk files in the first place so it is not necessarily as simple as I have stated it.</p><p>To add some technical substance to what I&#039;m proposing, I&#039;m considering adding a make variable PKG_PREFIX which is set in include/pakage.mk based on whether the package is built as &quot;y&quot; or &quot;m&quot;. Package makefiles are then modified to use $(1)$(PKG_PREFIX) as the installation root. I would not want to change the Package/foo/install $(1) parameter to include this so that packages can still put their config files in $(1)/etc. The bulk of the files would go into $(1)$(PKG_PREFIX), but a packager can choose to ignore $(PKG_PREFIX) if necessary.</p><p>The actual value used for PKG_PREFIX for modules could be a configuration parameter, so people could use /usr/local or elsewhere if they wanted to.</p><p>[Is this the best forum for discussing development ideas like this? The mailing list looks rather quiet.]</p>									</div>

					<p>Slight change to the PKG_PREFIX idea. Instead of defining PKG_PREFIX (which has problems due to nesting of $(eval $(call ...)) and needing to use $$(PKG_PREFIX), or maybe $$$$(PKG_PREFIX)), a second argument is supplied to Package/foo/install which contains the installation prefix. </p><p>An installation macro would look like:</p><p>define Package/foo/install<br />&nbsp; $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)($2)/bin<br />&nbsp; $(INSTALL_BIN) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/foo $(1)$(2)/bin<br />&nbsp; $(INSTALL_DATA) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/foo.conf $(1)/etc<br />endef</p>									</div>

So if you used a prefix of /opt for instance, you&#039;d end up with files in /opt/etc, /opt/usr/bin, etc? That&#039;s rather messy, but doable.</p><p>Apart from the validity of my method of achieving this, do you see a particular reason for maintaining a distinction between / and /usr ? I&#039;m asking because on embedded systems I&#039;ve developed, I&#039;ve done away with /usr without any issues, because the rationale for /usr (according to FHS) doesn&#039;t make much sense in the embedded devices that I&#039;ve targetted.</p>									</div>
