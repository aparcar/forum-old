					<p>I am needing some help with getting my TP-Link MR3040 online. I am having an impossible time getting this thing online. Currently I have openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3040-v2-squashfs-factory and I have tried everything I can think of and for the life of me I cannot get it online. I have even come across openwrt documentation during my searches and to be honest, they haven&#039;t help much and don&#039;t make it very clear (especially if you&#039;re a noob) to what needs to be done.</p><p>I don&#039;t care to much if I get online via Ethernet or WiFi. Perhaps one way is better than the other in some way (other than speed)? I am following the minipwnr project instructions and getting this thing online is whats hanging me up. With all of that said, is there a standard set of instructions on how to get openwrt barrier breaker online despite the device it&#039;s on? I guess I am just trying to find out what things I should be looking at or doing to get it online.</p><p>My current home network setup is:<br />Cable modem connects to...</p><p>Netgear WNDR3700 - With DDWRT<br />LAN IP 192.168.1.1<br />Subnet 255.255.255.0<br />DHCP enabled<br />AP Mode</p><p>Not sure what else would be useful as far as the router goes. Then I have a:<br />Netgear 8 port switch in my home office that is connected from the WNDR3700</p><p>What I imagining I should do is to get my TP-Link MR3040 to connect to the WNDR3700 via wifi. Thoug I would be just as satisfied to have it accomplish that via ethernet. As long as I can get it online to do what I need to do in way of installing packages, Ill be happy. As asked earlier, what do I need to do to get this thing connected? What should I be looking at in Barrier Breaker as far as settings go to assist in getting it online? Any help would be much appreciated.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have been following the instructions to build my own MiniPwner. Unfortunately Im getting hung up on Step 3 under &quot;The Setup&quot;. To help me get this thing online, I have followed the instructions <a href="https://stuff.purdon.ca/?page_id=370">HERE</a> I have actually gone through those instructions a few times because every time I would get to &quot;Now edit the LAN interface and remove the bridge setting, it should only cover the wireless network.&quot; I would not be able to access the router and then I would have to try and get into failsafe mode. So as of right now, I have done EVERYTHING in those instructions except removing the bridge settings from the LAN and it currently covers LAN and WAN.</p><p>If I connect the MR3040 to my small switch in my office, I am able to connect via wifi from my laptop and in fact get online. However the &quot;internet&quot; icon on the MR340 doesn&#039;t turn on to show that its online. On top of that, I can still SSH to it and access the web interface, but I cannot ping in the SSH nor install the updates (opkg install &lt;package name&gt;) as listed in the minipwner &quot;Build One&quot; instructions.</p><p>With all of that mentioned, is there something I am missing? How do I get this thing online so that I can continue building my minipwner?</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help. I greatly appreciate it.</p>									</div>
