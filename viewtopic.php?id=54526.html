					<p>Hi!<br />I have an wireless network based on tp-link devices, all with openwrt installed. My network is on school and students have free access to wifi network.<br />I need to connect an chromecast device to an TV in order to distribute informations for students.<br />But obvious i don&#039;t need some nasty joke from guys wich connect to chromecast and post videos unauthorized.<br />Will be great if google add some basic filter based on mac address to control access on his device but for moment need to resolv myself this problem.<br />So, how control device access to chromecast?<br />My ideea is to create an separate, encrypted wifi and connect chromecast to this network. I want to specify that chromecast will be connected to an router (second not main router) in order to make possibil to filter access to chromecast.<br />Another users who connect to free wifi network (eventually will be isolated), so no connection to chromecast. For users that connect to another device on lan, i will add mac filter to the router where is connected chromecast, so access will be controled based on mac address.<br />Sounds like a good solution? I think that will need some portforwarding on router to allow access from external network to chromecast, but will work?&nbsp; <br />Some suggestions, possibly simpler?<br />Is possibil to bridge one wifi network (free) to wan and another (encrypted) with lan, so encrypted clients will be routed and another not?<br />Can be done this job without need of second router?</p><p>I know that there are many questions, but restriction access to chromecast can be a real problem on public places. I know that is not build for that, but this is situation <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p>									</div>
