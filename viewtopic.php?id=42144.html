					<p>I sometimes do work at a location with no broadband or local wifi access, however I&#039;m just on the limit of detecting a nearby BT wifi hotspot.&nbsp; While my tablet and phones can&#039;t get a good connection it occured to me I could take a spare DIR 825 I recently built and use that as a client to connect to the BT hotspot (I do have a valid account with BT).&nbsp; The validation for connecting to the hotspot is done by entering my email address and password into a web browser challenge when I connect.</p><p>I played around this afternoon with the DIR 825 configured the way I would for a client setup normally however I cannot access the logon page properly as it won&#039;t show up properly.&nbsp; Some stuff is working as I&#039;m picking up an IP and any page I attempt to access is redirecting to the BT logon page, which then won&#039;t load properly.</p><p>Any ideas?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Did you manage to get this to work? I find that I have mixed success: I desabled rebind protection (I use a VPN for security) sometimes openwrt connects (e.g. MacDonalds: it connects and then any openwrt client can access the MacD greetings page accepting their T&amp;C) and sometimes it does not (just don&#039;t get a connection at all so no option to even get to the &#039;accept T&amp;Cs&#039; page).</p><p>On a mobile phone, you won&#039;t get the wifi logo until you have connected and accepted the network&#039;s T&amp;Cs page. On a laptop, you can connect and have to open a browser to connect to the first page. This is the kind of behaviour I am looking for but am struggling to get there...</p><p>Herman</p>									</div>
