					<p>Hello!</p><p>I have TP-Link 3220 v2 with Barrier Breaker installed on flash card.</p><p>After looking through repository, i found that busybox version there is newer than installed one.</p><p>So i did the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/tmp# opkg install busybox_1.22.1-3_ar71xx.ipk
Upgrading busybox on root from 1.19.4-5 to 1.22.1-3...
Collected errors:
 * check_data_file_clashes: Package busybox wants to install file /etc/init.d/sysntpd
        But that file is already provided by package  * base-files
 * check_data_file_clashes: Package busybox wants to install file /sbin/mkswap
        But that file is already provided by package  * swap-utils
 * opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package busybox.</code></pre></div><p>I did:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/tmp# opkg install busybox_1.22.1-3_ar71xx.ipk --force-overwrite
Upgrading busybox on root from 1.19.4-5 to 1.22.1-3...

Configuring busybox.</code></pre></div><p>For some reason it deleted the above mentioned files (i suppose symlinks) from /sbin/ and after that device doesn&#039;t boot with usb inside.</p><p>But without it it boots just fine.</p><p>Is there a way to restore symlinks to busybox without whole system reinstallation?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Toshik</strong> on 6 Jan 2016, 22:14)</p>
