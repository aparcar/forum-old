Use the linksys gui to upgrade! (there&#039;s no other SIMPLE way)<br />2) Yes,there&#039;s a gui, but i suggest to upgrade the gui with webif^2 (<a href="http://www.x-wrt.org">www.x-wrt.org</a>)</p><p>Finally i suggest you (for the first time use) to install directly the image of Openwrt from x-wrt (the firmwares hosted on that site already come with webif installed).</p><p>It&#039;s up to you.... standard openwrt + your work to install webif or&nbsp; openwrt with webif preinstalled (but I don&#039;t remember if it&#039;s the latest version of openwrt).</p><p>Happy OpenWRT&#039;ing!</p>									</div>
