					<p>So I&#039;ve run into this issue with my first generation atheros based fonera all of a sudden. I recently compiled a fairly up to date revision of kamikaze with MOSTLY default configs. everything that was set as an optional ipkg was left as is and everything set as installed in the rootfs image was left as is. I only removed a handful of packages from the compile altogether that either didn&#039;t wanna compile without errors or ones that had no use on the fonera board (usb kernel module, ide kernel module, and a number of video/sound services come to mind). That and I made a TINY change to the LAN address to be static at 10.0.0.1 with a 255.255.255.0 netmask. madwifi is also set to install from the getgo with default options.</p><p>So everything got flashed ok. Though I had to use a slightly retooled tutorial elsewhere to get the updated 2.6 image to fit on the flash through redboot (default tut on dd-wrt threw an error about not finding enough flash space to write the boot image).</p><p>But now that&#039;s all said and done, both the LAN and wireless interfaces are dead. Got my machine set up here with a static address of 10.0.0.5 and hooked to it. scan the whole subnet. Zip. Even tried switching to the 192.168.1.255 subnet to see if it somehow reverted. Still nothing there. And even the wireless seems dead (though I dun remember if madwifi is set to go into ap mode from the start. Though I now seem to remember there being a security mechanism against this where you had to manually enable it from the shell).</p><p>Anyone know what I may have missed here? Or maybe I&#039;m dealing with a bad flash? I can still get into redboot just fine. But the kamikaze install isn&#039;t letting me in.</p><p>BTW, I do not have suitable hardware available to me to get in through the serial connection so that&#039;s OOQ. I&#039;m stuck with trying to get in through the LAN or WLAN interfaces.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi, </p><p>Did you change the IP in the &quot;image configuration&quot;-menu?<br />I tried to change the default-config of my fonera-images a few weeks ago, and after changing the ip in the &quot;image configuration&quot;-menu the network config wasnÂ´t working. I canÂ´t remember what was wrong, but I have a<br /> serialconsole, so it was no problem to fix the networkconfig. <br />but changing the defaultconfig of the image didnÂ´t work for me. <br />Maybe itÂ´s not ready for the fonera?<br />I think you have to live with this situation, and start with 192.168.1.1</p>									</div>

					<p>@ggp81, no I didn&#039;t see the first link and it seems to clearly explain how to determine the proper hex values needed during the flashing process so I will probably definitely try and reflash with that page to go by.</p><p>@eleron216, yeah. I usually always run that option for changing the default ip, but I will try the option of leaving it alone and seeing if it pops up under 192.168.1.1 . Thanks for the insight.</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it wasn&#039;t a problem dealing with a not working config file, maybe it was just the firewall which was blocking the access of ssh, telnet and http when the interface had a certain address.<br />I also had that problem with my Meraki Mini (very similar to Fonera). At now I&#039;m working with the default ip. Later I&#039;ll try to check out iptables rules at startup.</p>									</div>
