					<p>I can not seem to get answers on the IRC forum for ALL of the questions below. </p><p>There are three (3) things I would like to accomplish hopefully using OpenWRT Kamikaze version 7.09 with the 2.4 kernel on my WRTSL54gs . </p><p>My WRTSL54gs is currently running Kamikaze 7.09 with the 2.6 kernel.&nbsp; I can ping the outside places such as <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">www.yahoo.com</a> etc...</p><p>1.) Can Kamikaze 7.09 using the 2.4 kernel connect to my ISP using&nbsp; PPPOE&nbsp; and DSL using a STATIC IP address ?</p><p>2.) Will I be able to use my Palm TX to connect to the WRTSL54gs with Kamikaze 7.09 using the 2.4 kernel&nbsp; to access the web using WiFi using DHCP ?&nbsp; </p><p>3.) Can Kamikaze 7.09 using the 2.4 kernel connect workstations using STATIC IPs for the internal LAN.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>CAN OpenWRT running Kamikaze 7.09 kernel 2.4 do&nbsp; ***ALL***&nbsp; three (3) of these things ?</p><p>THREE MORE QUESTIONS PLEASE;</p><p>As mentioned above, I currently have Kamikaze 7.09 installed and running on my WRTSL54gs with the 2.6 kernel and WiFi does not work but USB does work perfectly.&nbsp; </p><p>4.) IF openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx with the TRX extension is in the /tmp directory on my WRTSL54gs and I issue the command ;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mtd write -r /tmp/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx linux</p><p>will the 2.6 version of Kamikaze 7.09 be overwritten by the 2.4 version of Kamikaze 7.09 version and the router reboot ? </p><p>5.) As mentioned above, USB currently works flawlessly. Will USB work with Kamikaze 7.09 using the 2.4 kernel ?</p><p>6.) Why are TRX files used instead of BIN files to overwrite existing Kamikaze 7.09 installations using the 2.6 kernel ?</p><p>PLEASE ADDRESS THE FIRST FIVE QUESTIONS ABOVE, AS THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. The last question is asked out of curiosity.</p>									</div>
