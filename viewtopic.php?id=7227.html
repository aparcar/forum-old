					<p>Ok solved this already. The reason was that libopenssl, zlib packages were installed to /opt (usb). I had to add few synlinks:<br />ln -s /opt/usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7 /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7<br />ln -s /opt/usr/lib/libz.so.1 /usr/lib/libz.so.1</p><p>I have followed this nice guide <a href="http://www.macsat.com/macsat/content/view/16/30/">http://www.macsat.com/macsat/content/view/16/30/</a> and added <em><strong>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/opt/usr/lib:/opt/lib</strong></em> to /etc/profile and rebooted to avoide this problem but didn&#039;t help.</p><p>Anything wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>Commands in /etc/profile are executed when you login, so if you login and start a program which needs a library in /opt/usr/lib it will work.<br />But the sftp-server is started by dropbear which in turn was started by one of the init scripts, which simply don&#039;t know of or care about /etc/profile.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok, it&#039;s clear, why it doesn&#039;t work. But I&#039;m looking for a solution, I don&#039;t have to solve for each package. What I&#039;m looking for is a possibility to set path as well as ld_library_path at boot-time and therefore for all processes. That sounds total easy, but I haven&#039;t found a solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>if that doesn&#039;t work with a symlink from /opt , that is because /opt is not mounted before sftp server sarted...</p><p>so mount your /opt before <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>
