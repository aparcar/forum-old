					<p>Ah! I had this exact same problem and have been trying to figure it out for hours now... the magic &quot;<strong>nvram unset no_root_swap</strong>&quot; really does need to be made explicit on any documentation or wiki pages that suggest <strong>nvram set no_root_swap=1</strong></p><p>Anyhow, thanks for figuring this out, and posting the solution.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>indeed it works. I thought this line &quot;After the system boots you can unset this variable and manually fix the jffs2 partition, or simply run firstboot.&quot; gave me the choice to run firstboot instead of unsetting (wich of course didnt work because i set the variable to 0 dooh ...). But that didnt work for me aswell.</p><p>Thank you semifor for posting the solution!</p>									</div>
