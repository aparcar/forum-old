					<p>Hi,</p><p>I recently installed 7.09 (2.6) and TL-WN560G on my WL500gP.&nbsp; The wireless range and speed has been awful since.&nbsp; It works ok when the laptop is within a few feet of the router, but as soon as I take it outside the room, maybe 15ft, it goes from 54 to 5.5 in speed and can hardly hang on to a signal.&nbsp; It used to work great with 0.9 and the stock BCM wireless well outside the house, but now I can&#039;t go in to the next room.&nbsp; </p><p>My settings are below, any ideas?</p><p>config wifi-device&nbsp; wifi0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;atheros<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option channel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option disabled&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option disabled &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;11bg&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option diversity&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option txantenna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option rxantenna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option distance &#039;40&#039;</p><p>config wifi-iface<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wifi0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option network&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mode&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ap<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fjkshfkj<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option encryption&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;psk2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option hidden&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option key&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vgjksdfgjkhsd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option isolate&nbsp; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option txpower&nbsp; &#039;10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option bgscan&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option wds&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option bssid&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;&#039;</p><p>I tied both main and AUX connectors on the minipci and setting the antenna to 1 or 2.&nbsp; If it is set to 1 and connected to main, I get no connection at all.&nbsp; I also tried 3 different high gain antennas but have seen little improvement.&nbsp; I did see slight improvement after setting tx power from 0 to 10.&nbsp; The distance setting has not changed anything.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>oleg106</strong> on 7 Apr 2008, 23:43)</p>
