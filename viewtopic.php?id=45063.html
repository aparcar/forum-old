					<p>I am looking at starting up (and who knows, maybe even making progress) on a hobby project to create an emergency messaging system that would only require budget wireless routers and car batteries.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking at a few different open firmwares, and really like the modular approach of OpenWrt.&nbsp; Before I buy a development router, I was hoping if I could get a yea or nay on the ability to do the following things:</p><p>* Run an http server with php support.&nbsp; From <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/http.overview,">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/http.overview,</a> this looks very doable so long as I get a router with more than the bare minimum RAM.<br />* Create a mesh network with other routers running the same firmware.&nbsp; I have to learn a lot about this, but <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/mesh.olsr#how.to">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/mesh.olsr#how.to</a> seems like it&#039;s a well understood task.<br />* Create a web browser landing page for any device connecting to the router that forwards them to the internal http server.<br />* Store some data in non-volatile memory so that the web server database isn&#039;t lost when changing batteries.</p><p>It looks like all of these things are supported in some way or other, and know I definitely need to keep doing some reading, but I was hoping for a sanity check to make sure I&#039;m not biting off a lot more than an hour a two each evening can accomplish.</p><p>Thank you,<br />Louis</p>									</div>

					<p>4.&nbsp; Yes, you can have usb storage for non-volatile storage (if you have usb on the device), therefore<br />1.&nbsp; You can run an http server with php (but why php?--it&#039;s a resource hog compared to lua or bash scripting, requiring external flash or a lot of internal flash)<br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t exactly understand &quot;web browser landing page&quot;, but you can forward messages using nc to an nc listener<br />2.&nbsp; Why is it that you need mesh rather than an ordinary network with wired and/or wireless devices?</p><p>Note that you can run a not-too-big web server using an openWrt device&#039;s non-volatile storage.</p><p>What kind of emergency messaging?&nbsp; Would there be an advantage to including a cell modem so that you could send your emergency messages if the internet were down?</p><p>What kind of messages?&nbsp; How is it determined that a message needs to be sent?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lizby</strong> on 2 Jul 2013, 20:18)</p>

					<p>This would actually be for use primarily when the internet is down.&nbsp; The mesh network would not have a connection to the internet.&nbsp; The goal is something like a dynamic Usenet system.&nbsp; Where I am in NY we were hit pretty bad by weather, so internet and power were unreliable.&nbsp; It would have been cool to power up the phone once or twice a day, connect to the closest &quot;emergency_info&quot; access point and get all of the relevant news from county/local officials there, rather than having to try and guess which web sites are being updated.&nbsp; It would have an authenticated board for officials to post a message-of-the-day, and a non-authenticated board for any community discussion.&nbsp; Each AP would behave like a Usenet server and periodically sync messages across the APs.&nbsp; In order to cover a large area with cheap hardware without requiring manual configuration, a mesh seemed like the way to go.</p><p>It doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be PHP (would have preferred Ruby/Rails or Nodejs+Ember) but I&#039;d like to provide the message reader in browser to the connected device rather than requiring some sort of reader app that can&#039;t be fetched once the storm hits.&nbsp; All smartphones have some sort of web browser.</p><p>I spoke with &quot;jow_laptop&quot; on IRC earlier, and he recommended batman-adv instead of OLSR because it builds the mesh at a lower level, acting more transparently so I&#039;d have less to configure.&nbsp; In order to use Batman, I&#039;d need to make sure I&#039;m using kernel 2.6+.&nbsp; Also, the router will need to support dual radios, with one in AP and the other in ad-hoc mode (if I understand correctly).&nbsp; To properly support ad-hoc mode I&#039;ll need to use the madwifi, ath5k, ath9k, or proprietary broadcom (wl) driver.&nbsp; So, I either need to use a router that has dual radios or use two independent routers linked by an ethernet cable.&nbsp; I have to do more work to figure out which configuration is cheaper and lower-power.</p><p>Open to any suggestions/criticisms.</p>									</div>

					<p>What kind of emergency are you talkin&#039;bout?</p><p>I suggest: <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2010/27c3-4187-en-your_infrastructure_will_kill_you.html">http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/201 â€¦ l_you.html</a> 27C3 by Eleanor Saitta. <br />Time: 13:34 &quot;Six Ways to Die&quot; Just popped into my mind.

You communicate quicker, safer and with less misunderstandings when you&#039;d simply walk over there.</p><p>Ok, in a city, some 802.11 mesh, could be better then amateur radio, and cheaper, but then the backbone would have to have emergency battery and people laptops/mobile phones with emergency batterys (oops, most mobile phones have some stupid build-in recharchable power pack... god shave the marketing-people.</p><p>Ah, simply walk over. Unless of course, you&#039;d have some emergency like in Outbreak.

If I were to tackle this project with a budget of US $100, I would definitely go for an inexpensive Android GoogleTV USB dongle on a dual-core or quad-core ARM Cortex A9 CPU with 2/8 GB RAM/NAND. Since there is a need for a dual-mode WiFi (which I believe this USB dongle doesn&#039;t support), I would invest on another and/or a better USB WiFi dongle to make it a dual-mode. If the USB WiFi dongle has a support for a dual-mode WiFi, then just disable the WiFi on the Android GoogleTV USB dongle. The next step is to start porting OpenWRT to the Android GoogleTV USB dongle. Depending on where you shop, the lowest price I had come across for a dual/quad-core version was around US $40/80, respectively.</p>									</div>

					<p>Got stuck away from the computer for a few days, sorry.</p><p>kirschwasser, batman-adv seems like the way to go if I&#039;m going to make meshing the primary focus of the project.&nbsp; However, given realistic limitations on the outdoor range, you&#039;d need a ton of these things to just make it around the block.&nbsp; mazilo&#039;s budget is in the right area with $100/node being reasonable, but for development, I&#039;m pretty short on funds so building a bunch to test the mesh may be more than I can handle.</p><p>Serval is a cool idea, though I think having to rely on the phone batteries means the mesh will not be very dense as people are saving their limited charge.</p><p>I&#039;m not too worried about looters since the units would be cheap, not really useful outside their particular purpose, and possibly up on a telephone pole.</p><p>The conclusion from this is that mesh networking seems to get me very limited gains.&nbsp; If my objective is just to have a communications hub, I can prototype the message repository with the cheapest hardware that can run a web server and nodogsplash.&nbsp; I guess it ends up being like a LibraryBox + Twitter abomination.&nbsp; If I get ambitious, I can migrate to hardware that supports the mesh.</p>									</div>
