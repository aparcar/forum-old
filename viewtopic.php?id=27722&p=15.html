Many people who install accel-pptp clients to they routers are very happy. I havent seen messages that they can not connect with accel-pptp client.

					<p>I noticed something strange with this build: when I use Google maps, and particularly Street View, the router seems to &#039;hang&#039;. Internet traffic gets slower and stuck for a couple of seconds. Also I can&#039;t even load the router adminpages. Then it takes some seconds or even longer, and everything will work again!

In Russia PPTP is normal practice for ISPs.<br/>If you include pptp-client, that perform like&nbsp; PPTP in factory firmware Russian users of WNDR3700 will be very happy! ))))<br/>Current pptp client in OpenWRT Backfire &amp; DD-WRT &amp; Gargoyle works very slow. About 16-20 Mbit Down &amp; about 6-12 Mbit Up.<br/>Pings in also not good. I think accel-pptp will work much better. I Would install it to my router myself, but I don&#039;t know how. I am not power linux user. ((((<br/>If you need a vpn server you can done it with your PC and port forwarding. But if your ISP require PPTP the router without client is useless for you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>morzexxx</strong> on 21 Jan 2011, 11:39)</p>

					<p>arokh,</p><p>thanks will test it tonight. Would it be possible for you to post a small test with iperf about the wireless stuff?

So it seems that the whole router gets stuck. Any ideas?</p></blockquote></div><p>Update: this problem occurs also in other builds. Nobody else has this problem? You can test it by going to <a href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com</a>, search for some place and use streetview. Suddenly it stops loading google maps. If you open a new tab you should notice that other sites don&#039;t load also. Even logging into the router doesn&#039;t work. A few seconds or minuts later, everything works again.<br/>Could it be that it is crashing because of Google Maps creating multiple connections fast? Just a guess. But I really would like to know if you guys have this problem too, so I can rule out OpenWrt or this build. Maybe it is my router or something else...<br/>(Update2: It is a weird problem with Firefox.
