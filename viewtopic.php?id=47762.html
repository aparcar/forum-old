					<p>notice&nbsp; least, sure as much ram possible the better(and a faster cpu ) . It depends on the budget Running a torrent client is not a routers job imho. You might want to consider dedicate a spare pc for so many tasks(x86 openwrt arch)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gkarakou</strong> on 10 Dec 2013, 18:39)</p>

					<p>&quot;NAS server, Bittorrent client&quot; are pretty much out of question with normal consumer routers, I&#039;d suggest building or getting an old pc to do the job. I/O writes/reads will crash your modem with&nbsp; nas and/or bittorrent, as those products weren&#039;t meant to do such tasks. With fine tuning you could run bittorrent client with 1 torrent at very limited peer count and speed limit</p>									</div>

					<p>You could get 32mb flash and 128 mb ram with 120-150 euros(150$-180$) .There are some buffalos and asus (maybe linksys and d-link too)that have these specs. <br />You could get around without running nas and torrent client with a 65 euros tp-link(8mb flash -128mb ram)</p>									</div>
