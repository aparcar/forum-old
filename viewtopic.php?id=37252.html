					<p>I was in a rush, being impatient, not reading all of the instructions, and on a reload deleted everything off the WNDR3700.&nbsp; When I reload the firmware I have no wifi.&nbsp; Research so far points to &quot;caldata&quot;&nbsp; Can someone help me locate where to download this &quot;caldata&quot; from and some instructions on how to reload it would be awesome.</p><p>This is my lesson for the week!</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have really deleted your caldata, reflashing firmware would not help, because those data were provided by manufacturer and firmware update never touch those data (and they shouldn&#039;t). You need to get data from others with same type and same revision number.</p>									</div>
