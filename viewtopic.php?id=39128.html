					<p>hello,</p><p>im using dyndns for years now and it always worked 100% on my old 54gl router. since i swtiched to my new TP-Link TL-WR1043ND i have this problem, that the ddns client doesnt update properly. i set it up like it is described in the wiki, but it seems not to work sometimes and i dont know why. for example, i just noticed today that it didnt update anymore since a few days. i looked at dyndns and it said last update was on august 31th. my router is set to connect new every day at 5:00am with this cronjob (00 5 * * * /usr/bin/logger &quot;Scheduled WAN reconnect started&quot; &amp;&amp; /sbin/ifup wan). it&#039;s a pppoe client. heres my ddns config file:</p><p>config &#039;service&#039; &#039;myddns&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;service_name&#039; &#039;dyndns.org&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;force_unit&#039; &#039;hours&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;check_interval&#039; &#039;10&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;check_unit&#039; &#039;minutes&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;enabled&#039; &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;domain&#039; &#039;***.dyndns.org&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;username&#039; &#039;***&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;password&#039; &#039;***&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;force_interval&#039; &#039;25&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ip_source&#039; &#039;interface&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ip_interface&#039; &#039;pppoe-wan&#039;</p><p>i just connected over ssh and ran: /usr/lib/ddns/dynamic_dns_updater.sh myddns</p><p>and it said &quot;time_since_update = 11 hours&quot; which is correct with my setting to get a new ip at 5:00am. so whats the problem? can it be the ddns client tries to update a few seconds &quot;too early&quot; before a proper connection was initiated? is there a way to let it wait or retry until it was updated properly?</p>									</div>
