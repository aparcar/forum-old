					<p>I&#039;m going to skip over a lot of details.</p><p>Since you&#039;re installing all of perl, space isn&#039;t a problem.&nbsp; Manually install packages from a distro, say.. debian.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need a full libc.&nbsp; If ldd perl doesn&#039;t think perl is an executable, you need to manually install /lib/ld-linux.so.2 and libc.so.6 (maybe some other .&lt;digit&gt;) from the distro packages.</p><p>With all the libraries needed installed, you need to set up the perl libraries; my perl expected them in /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8/ and /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.8/.&nbsp; Again, the files that go in here are available in distro packages.&nbsp; A lot of this is platform independent, so you can just copy it from an existing system.</p><p>You can also compile perl statically, but I had some headaches with that.</p><p>All of the libraries perl needs take about 1.7 mb and bzip2s to 790k (in the event unpacking in a ram-backed union-fs is an option).</p><br /><p>The perl libraries take about 6mb compressed, 25mb uncompressed (they&#039;re not all needed for any given script, but it&#039;s better to start out with a full lib).</p><p>You&#039;re on your own for cpan.</p><br /><br /><p>ndiswapper needs perl for one of its scripts.</p><p>you could port it over to C, but good luck with that.&nbsp; pp execuatables work (with additions to /lib), but it&#039;s slow.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have any luck with perlcc.</p><p>ndiswrapper only works for x86 (so... vmware, soekris, etc).&nbsp; I suppose you could do something funky with qemu, but that&#039;s pretty hard</p><p>You need to edit the makefiles (in ndiswrapper-&lt;version&gt; and the utils and drivers dirs)<br />CC = .../staging_dir_mipsel/bin/x86-linux-uclibc-gcc<br />LD = .../staging_dir_mipsel/bin/x86-linux-uclibc-ld<br />manually set KVERS<br />manually set KBUILD</p><p>Once it&#039;s built, copy ndiswrapper to /usr/sbin and loadndisdriver to /sbin</p><p>make /etc/ndiswapper, while you&#039;re at it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>exobyte</strong> on 15 Jun 2008, 02:39)</p>

					<p>Thinking about it... For ndiswapper, you probably don&#039;t need the perl script on the router; it&#039;s for getting status info.&nbsp; Running it on a machine with perl to generate the contents of /etc/ndiswrapper and copying those files over to the router might work.</p>									</div>
