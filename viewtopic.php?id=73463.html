					<p>A friend of mine who does a lot of programming, said, that the RAM BORKED message means, that the Cisco AP found out that there is a &quot;fake&quot; UART connected, and blocks it&#039;s memory. That is because I used a &quot;cheap&quot; Chinese UART USB converter.</p><p>The USB converter should really have an independent CP2102 chipset.</p><p>The USB converters which are sourced locally, should work. Today or tomorrow the new USB converter will arrive. I will try again and let you know.</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I managed to get it done.</p><p>It turns out that you cannot interrupt the boot process by holding 2. The time the USB port needs to be accepted by Windows once inserted, takes too much time. In that time the MR18 is already booted.</p><p>Unless you have a REAL RS232 (9 pins) on the back of the computer (I have one on my docking station), then it might work.</p><p>In any case, the manual says that the firmware should be uploaded into &quot;part 2&quot;&nbsp; of the NAND. That did not work because of the late interrupt (see above). So I installed into &quot;part 1&quot;. After reboot, I got immediately the LEDE prompt. After that the device was reachable at 192.168.1.1, and the GUI was working. So after that 5 minutes of work (new firmware, reboot etc...) it works like a charm.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>haik01</strong> on 8 Mar 2018, 00:05)</p>
