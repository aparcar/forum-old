					<p>We have 2 units of TL-WR1043nd v1.x<br />1 running Attitude Adjustment 12.09 (AA)<br />1 running Barrier Breaker 14.07 (BB)</p><p>Problem 1: (with default setup)<br />AA has no problem time synchronization when reboot or power failure/trip.<br />BB could not synchronise time when reboot or power failure/trip. Time deviation could be a few hours to 30 minutes behind actual time. Sometimes it is accurate.<br />AA is time sync is tip-top, we tested with power trip simulations.</p><p>Problem 2: (LuCi-&gt;System-&gt;Local Time-&gt;Sync with browser)<br />AA, click on the Sync with browser button restore time immediately. No network disconnection.<br />BB, click on the Sync with browser button takes 30sec and it seems pppoe-wan, lan interfaces got reset and connections restarted. This is annoying.</p><p>Problem 3:<br />Because of the above problem we have started to try out the actual ntpd package and disable the default busybox sysntpd service. The actual ntpd package did not help our situation. After remove actual ntpd package how can we restore the busybox ntpd command back?</p><p>From a user point of view BB time synchronization is horrible compare to AA which work (from default and no configuration needed). Are we missing anything here? Can someone kind to enlighten us. Many Thanks.</p>									</div>
