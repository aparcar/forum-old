					<p>I think I&#039;ve found some kind of problem or something. Im currently running a WRT54GS version 1.1 on OpenWrt RC3 and have noticed that after an uptime of around 8 to 11 days a net radio station I listen to will start to buffer alot, so much so that it buffers about once per minute.</p><p>I rebooted my router and these problems have disapeared so I&#039;m guessing something was happening but I dont know what. Can anyone help me with fixing this? Im currently running the patch that nico posted a while back for the GS 1.1&#039;s to stabalise a few things.</p><p>Also, how do i manually set the MTU of vlan1 through nvram or otherwise? Its currently 1500 but I have clamp-to-pmtu enabled in my iptables, I would quite like to set the mtu to 1492 none the less to see if it aleviates the problem (however Im guessing streaming audio will burst small packets in rapid succession rather than pushing large packets).</p><p>Any advice would be great thank you <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>Pulse.</p>									</div>

					<p>Seems to be buffering again actually, buffer is even set to 512kb, must be the station and not the router then I guess.</p><p>Anyone able to answer the mtu question regardless as I know my ISP is set to 1492 anyway.</p>									</div>
