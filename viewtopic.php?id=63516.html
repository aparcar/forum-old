					<p>So I&#039;m trying to add a serial port connector to my C7 but I can&#039;t get it to show me anything. A few days ago I transplanted a 3 pin header from another circuit board to use in the C7 along with serial cable that I found for my raspberry pi. After soldering in the pin headers and connecting it, I found out first the cable had a fake FTDI chip in it and secondly it just flat out doesn&#039;t work in Windows 10. After re-assembling the router I found out that while it turns on and the power, star, 2.4 &amp; 5 GHz, ethernet jack and WPS lights come on (no internet since I was using it as a WAP), it wasn&#039;t broadcasting SSIDs nor could I access it via it&#039;s IP. I also couldn&#039;t recover it via TFTP (edit: It doesn&#039;t even boot into recovery mode, it just ignores the button and boots up normally, I sniffed the packets). It was sending and (trying to) receiving packets though since there was activity with the LAN light. I just tried it again now (a few days later), using it as a switch and it works perfectly, so there&#039;s nothing wrong with it which is great, but I can&#039;t access LuCI or SSH via the IP I had assigned to it before all of this happened. <strong>edit:</strong>&nbsp; I ran a portscan of the 192.168.1.0 subnet and didn&#039;t find any IP registered to the C7, the WiFi doesn&#039;t work, yet it works perfectly as a switch.</p><p>I bought a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12731">MicroUSB to Serial Breakout - FT232RL</a> and soldered the Tx, Rx and Ground wires from the FTDI to the pads on the C7; connected the USB cable to my PC and let it install the drivers, then opened up PuTTY and connected to COM7; then I connected the power cable to the router and pressed the power button, all the lights came on but there wasn&#039;t any output from the console....</p><p>Thinking maybe I made a bad joint, I tested the continuity from each pin on the FTDI with the corresponding pin on the C7 and each one rang out! Then just to make sure that I wasn&#039;t shorting any pins, I tested the continuity between the Tx and RX pins on both the FTDI and the C7 and they were quiet. I did the same between Rx and Ground and it was quiet also. I repeated this with Tx and Ground and it rung out on both ends!</p><p>Now I&#039;m not that great with electrical work (my dad is an electrician so I know a little bit), but is there supposed to be continuity between Tx and Ground (Pins 1 &amp; 3), and not between Rx and Ground (2 &amp; 3)? Also while the board was powered on and the FTDI was connected to my PC I decided to check the voltages and I got 2.121v DC for the Tx and 3.310v DC on the Rx, something tells me the Tx should be 3.3v also shouldn&#039;t it?</p><p>On a side note, I also have the JTAG pin headers soldered in, in case it helps with debugging WTF is going on.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>brando56894</strong> on 20 Mar 2016, 02:19)</p>

					<p>I seem to be having the same results that you are. I am using a 3.3v configured <a href="http://jim.sh/ftx/">FTDI FT230X</a> and a 3.3v configured CP2102 UART chips </p><p>Neither have worked. Both have the same result, when the chips are powered (and the devices recognized by the computer) the C7 refuses to boot. It shows the first four LEDs from the left as being on, and the WPS LED all the way on the right-side. Nothing is outputted to the console. </p><p>I&#039;ve pretty much reached my limit of understanding, I can only assume that it&#039;s checking for voltage on one of those pins and that is causing it to not boot on purpose.</p>									</div>

					<p>I haven&#039;t been able to successfully boot OpenWRT yet.

					<p>Actually, this doesn&#039;t look so bad. Not an encrypted/signed lockdown scenario, just a relatively trivial hardware substitution by TP-Link. The MTD driver isn&#039;t recognising the (new type?) SPI flash chip and hence the kernel can&#039;t mount root.</p><p>This commit to the kernel in early 2015 added your particular device (JEDEC id c84018) <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/drivers/mtd/spi-nor/spi-nor.c?id=fcc87a95195236b0935183361a72e4a98bf577d8">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kerne … a98bf577d8</a></p><p>I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the OpenWRT kernel or the OpenWRT device tree for the Archer C7 that would need to be updated to accommodate this.</p>									</div>

					<p>After swapping the leads around I&#039;m getting 3.3v on both Rx and Tx and there is no longer continuity between pins one and three.

					<p>Totally didn&#039;t realize that, but it makes complete sense, I was trying to figure out the sender/receiver the way I had it hooked up and it just didn&#039;t make sense, that should have been my first clue.
