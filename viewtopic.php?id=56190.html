					<p>Hi, </p><p>i recently got an Archer C5 as my main Wifi AP and although the stock firmware works fine, i am pretty underwhelmed by the feature set it comes with. Especially interesting would be running an OpenVPN server on it. I have been trying to follow the posts about OpenWRT and the Archer C5 but since it is a decently new device, i stumble upon various levels of success of running OpenWRT on it. Like i mentioned before, stability is top priority on this particular device of mine ... so can anyone give first hand experience feedback of what the state of things regarding OpenWRT and the C5 are, which revisions work well, are there issues, quirks, things that plainly not work?</p><p>I really would appreaciate some feedback on this or i&#039;d rather stick with stock firmware and use my WR1043 for the experimental stuff.</p><p>cheers,<br/>e.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>evgeny.magata</strong> on 10 Mar 2015, 14:23)</p>
