					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>The D-Link DIR-601 already has rs232 pinout information made public (here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-600?s%5B%5D=table&amp;s%5B%5D=hardware#serial">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir- … are#serial</a>) but I&#039;m having trouble getting it to work.</p><p>The router is branded the DIR-601, and the firmware (upon logging into the web console) reports itself as DIR-601A1, but the board seems to have DIR-600A1 printed on it.</p><p>It seems that after soldering the connectors, powering on the device, and plugging the USB cable into the computer, the TX light on the shifter board is constantly on, which should never happen.&nbsp; Even if a key is held down, it still flickers.&nbsp; This leads me to believe that something somewhere is shorted, or the pinout I&#039;ve linked to above isn&#039;t correct (as well as the image on that page).</p><p>At this point, plugging in the router makes the RX light flicker for a while, most likely in response to the initial output when booting up.&nbsp; Nothing displays on screen, though, nor do any characters echo back when typed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tested using every baud rate on <a href="http://www.acroname.com/brainstem/ref/h/Hardware/baudrates.html">http://www.acroname.com/brainstem/ref/h … rates.html</a></p><p>I&#039;m using the Sparkfun rs232 shifter board kit (<a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/133">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/133</a>), which I&#039;ve used absolutely without issue on a number of other routers.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried swapping out this particular shifter board with another one verified to work, yet both still have the TX light constantly pulled high.</p><p>Does anyone else have experience getting a console on this router?&nbsp; Additional info: The router is refurbished, but that has never been a problem in the past with other devices.</p><p>Here&#039;s a pic of my soldering job: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eX7Uf.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/eX7Uf.jpg</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mncoppola</strong> on 31 Mar 2012, 08:15)</p>

					<p>the only curious thing i see is that you connected vcc, which is not recommended according to some sources (i was also always doing fine with just connecting tx, rx and gnd). besides that, maybe switch tx and rx.</p>									</div>
