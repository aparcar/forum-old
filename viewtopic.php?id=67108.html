					<p>Solved.</p><p>The patch name is &quot;740-MIPS-ath79-lp-wr934x-fixes.patch&quot;.<br />When I modified in &quot;gedit&quot; and saved it, not only &quot;740-MIPS-ath79-lp-wr934x-fixes.patch&quot; saved, but a new &quot;740-MIPS-ath79-lp-wr934x-fixes.patch~&quot;(a hide file) saved as well in that patch DIR. Next, this &quot;*.patch~&quot; file was also used to patch in compiling.</p><p>So strange errors occured.<br />Should deleted that file at first.</p>									</div>
