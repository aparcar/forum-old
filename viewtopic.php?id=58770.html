					<p>I have a MiWiFi which is an 802.11ac router from Xiaomi for around $35 USD.</p><p>I&#039;m pretty fond of it but not fond of the poor Wi-Fi performance and the router seems to be crashing every 15 min on Chaos Calmer 15.05 RC3.. any ideas on where to get started? </p><p>syslog and dmesg don&#039;t show anything useful before crash.</p>									</div>
