					<p>Hi again,</p><p>I look for an how to or informations on google, wiki and this forum but still no clue.<br />I want to get access to Luci gui from a reverse proxy. But not from OpenWRT itself. I have a webserver already with all my applications inside a LemonLDAP portal (using yunohost if some are interested, good project for getting his services at home)</p><p>As I say in my previous post, I&#039;m coming from DDWRT, this was possible with their gui (with a rewrite rule and reverse)<br />With Luci I get &quot;The requested URL /cgi-bin/luci was not found on this server.&quot; that&#039;s not good, few time I get I get issue to solve because it&#039;s more than the application is not &quot;ready&quot; for reverse.</p><p>Is it possible to get Luci working from an external reverse proxy ? Or with an other web gui if there is.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>As jow said it is possible, but what do you mean by application not ready?<br />I think there is something not setup right with the reverse proxy in this case, because when most reverse proxies can&#039;t reach the upstream server, it will give a 500 error bad gateway.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>Code don&#039;t care about proxy, that&#039;s right.<br />But I know that depend on how the application is done, I have 2 ways usualy to get it inside an apache reverse proxy :</p><p>-application is &#039;ready&#039; for reverse : there is a &quot;webroot&quot; or other type of parameter that make it possible to run from a directory so you reverse apache/app to myapp:9999/app<br />-you don&#039;t have this and so you use a rewrite at same time that reverse from a Location setting</p><p>But sometimes you have an application that&#039;s using hard coded redirection for exemple (the authentification one is the most naughty, I get it with Shinken and Foreman)<br />That&#039;s why I get an issue with &quot;/cgi-bin/luci&quot; but I&#039;m not able to fix it.<br />So if any one as done it before coz I didn&#039;t find any clue to it (make it better to access all applications from the same portal and so I don&#039;t have to open OpenWRT access from the world as my &quot;portal&quot; have access)</p>									</div>
