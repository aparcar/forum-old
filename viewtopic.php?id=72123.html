					<p>As a first time user, you are not allowed to post links. This is an effective measure to stop spamming.</p><p>Regarding your problem: You installed a trunk image, which does not contain LuCI. You have to install it manually.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/infobox/attention_trunk">https://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/infobox/attention_trunk</a></p>									</div>
