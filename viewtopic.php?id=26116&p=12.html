At <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=140797#p140797">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=140797#p140797</a> I described the steps (two of them actually) to get it working (with a minor restriction) on all Backfire releases up to 10.03.1. I&#039;d like to encourage you just trying it - it&#039;s very easy to configure (approximately 2% more effort than just installing stock OpenWrt w/o AAP).</p><p>best,<br/>orange</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orange</strong> on 11 Jun 2012, 17:48)</p>

					<p>@Seth7<br/>If you&#039;re not that used to Redboot-based (manual) flashing, I recommend FonFlash available at <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/download.php">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/download.php</a> for flashing your Fon 2100/2200. As of the right images, you should use openwrt-atheros-root.squashfs and openwrt-atheros-vmlinux.lzma</p><p>There is one thing with FonFlash that is rather annoying but unfortunately ignored by developers: It does a &quot;fis init&quot; to initialize the flash rom while it should do a &quot;fis init -f&quot; instead. This seems to be rather minor but actually it isn&#039;t. If you happen to encounter some very strange behavior of the device after flashing whatever OpenWrt image with FonFlash (especially after migrating from dd-wrt), you should manually connect to Redboot, place a &quot;fis init -f&quot; and continue flashing with FonFlash. This is just to share some experience, you may not even notice that issue (if you&#039;re lucky).</p><p>best,<br/>orange</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orange</strong> on 20 Jun 2012, 11:27)</p>
