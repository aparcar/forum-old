					<p>I&#039;m trying to build trunk #10594 for the NSLU2. It builds alright (with the default configuration) and installs, and seems to boot, but its unresponsive. I can&#039;t ping or telnet it. Strangely enough it does do a DHCPOFFER but after that I can&#039;t get anything out of it. I have a serial log which looks normal and ends with:</p><p>Please be patient, while OpenWrt loads ...<br />- preinit -<br />switching to jffs2<br />mini_fo: using base directory: /<br />mini_fo: using storage directory: /jffs<br />- init -</p><p>Please press Enter to activate this console.

					<p>Huh. Thanks. </p><p>Once I fixed my handbuilt serial port, that worked. It revealed that although OpenWRT might have done a DHCPREQUEST it in fact ignores the infomation and comes up with a static address of 192.168.1.1. As that is the address of my DSL modem it wasn&#039;t terribly visible.</p><p>Much obliged,</p>									</div>
