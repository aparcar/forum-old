					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I added a custom &quot;banner-extension&quot; shell-script under /etc/hotplug.d/iface/20-banner and discovered a small &quot;problem&quot; or at least a small usefull extension for /etc/ppp/ip-up.</p><p>The mentioned banner-extension is just a quick-hack and only adds the date&amp;time and the current dynamic assigned IP-address:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  _______                     ________        __

     LAST IP-UP EXECUTION:
Fri Feb 10 21:41:53 CET 2006
         EXTERNAL IP:
           111.222.333.444
................................</code></pre></div><p>In my opinion this two informations (last update-time and IP) are very helpfull in case you log in to your router (over internet) and want to start a more or less long configuration session without being disconnected right after 5 Minutes because the 24-hours-limit has been reached!</p><p>The problem concerning the banner-generation was: the /etc/hotplug.d/iface/banner-ext.sh does not know about the current local nor the current remote IP-address!<br />But pppd already provides these two informations to IP-UP. On the other hand OpenWRT&#039;s (WhiteRussian RC4) /etc/ppp/ip-up script does not use them.</p><p>So, my suggestion would be the folowing small extension to /etc/ppp/ip-up</p><p>instead of:<br />[ -z &quot;$6&quot; ] || env -i ACTION=&quot;ifup&quot; INTERFACE=&quot;$6&quot; PROTO=&quot;ppp&quot; /sbin/hotplug &quot;iface&quot;</p><p>please use this:<br />[ -z &quot;$6&quot; ] || env -i ACTION=&quot;ifup&quot; LOCALIP=&quot;$4&quot; REMOTEIP=&quot;$5&quot; INTERFACE=&quot;$6&quot; PROTO=&quot;ppp&quot; /sbin/hotplug &quot;iface&quot;</p><p>I would suggest to include at least these two variables into /etc/ppp/ip-up to make passing of dynamic alocated IP-addresses possible within hotplug.d-scripts...</p><p>If you are also interessted in my banner-manipulation please let me know!</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p><p>Cheers dp</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dp</strong> on 10 Feb 2006, 23:20)</p>
