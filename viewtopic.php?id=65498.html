					<p>Hello. I have a RavPower WD-02 that I&#039;d like to put OpenWRT on.</p><p>I have followed most of the instructions on the wiki page for this device, to the point of creating the factory upgrade image. I have not uploaded it yet. I would like to know how to set up the WiFi vs Ethernet before I find myself in trouble, since I would like to be able to: <br />Convert a WiFi network into an ethernet connection<br />Convert a wired network into a new WiFi connection<br />Bridge a WiFi network into a new one broadcast from the device (either in bridge or repeater mode)</p><p>I don&#039;t really understand the syntax or purpose of all the different network files, so is there a really good guide somewhere (I found one here, but am not quite certain I understand it...) or a way to do this in LuCi?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rdragonrydr</strong> on 12 Jun 2016, 16:34)</p>
