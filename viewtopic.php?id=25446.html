					<p>I have USB and USB storage working and installed luci-app-samba for samba sharing. It all seems to work but I can not access the shares from XP or 7. It wants a login/password but nothing works here. I also can&#039;t seem to edit smb.conf because it gets restored whenever SAMBA restarts.</p><p>Does luci-app-samba work?
