					<p>Hi all,</p><p>In this days I&#039;ve tried the transmission daemon on my router, and I ran into the problem described into the topic subject.<br />I&#039;ve tested the demon on an APU1d board with 2GB of RAM (and dual core CPU @1GHz), that for a router is a lot of RAM, and even with so much RAM, I&#039;ve seen that Transmission can easily saturate memory it with only 2 active torrent...<br />This is a massive RAM utilization!!!!</p><p>So there&#039;s anyone which can suggest me a workaround to fix this RAM dispersion problem?<br />any help would be appreciated.</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p><p><strong>EDIT: possible solution: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=270338#p270338">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 38#p270338</a></strong> (Thanks to jmarunix)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mirko_47</strong> on 30 Mar 2015, 18:21)</p>

					<p>I found rtorrent to be much more efficient RAM-wise than Transmission. How many torrents have you loaded (you mention &#039;active&#039; torrents, which seems to suggest Transmission keeps a list of more torrents).</p><p>I don&#039;t know the internals of both programs, but maybe Transmission has a memory leak - do you see RAM usage going up steadily? In the end oom killer should throw it out.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you very much for the answer,</p><p>I&#039;ve loaded only 3 torrents: the newer version of ubuntu, debian and proxmox.<br />They aren&#039;t very heavy, the two that I&#039;ve said that they were active are debian and proxmox.</p><p>In any case, yes RAM usage increases steadily, the strange fact is that OOM killer doesn&#039;t kill transmission, but it begins cutting Wi-Fi connection first, and then all the other network connection.</p><p>Today I&#039;ve also tested Transmission deamon with DD-WRT, and i ran into the same problem, so it might be a bug of transmission.</p><p>Sorry for the noob question, but what do tou seggest to report this problem to developer?<br />open a ticket on OpenWRT Trac, or on transmission Trac?</p><p>Thank you very much again!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello all, <br />Like any of you, I have tested transmission-daemon on my minimalist router <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/comtrend/ar5387un">Comtrend-ar5387un</a> with the same problem of huge RAM use and, of course, crahses and freezes of the system.<br />But some days ago I think I found a solution. The problem isn&#039;t a bug in the program, it is a simple adjustment of kernel settings.<br />You can see this across the command <strong>logread</strong> and setting this parameter in the transmission config file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/transmission stop
vim /etc/config/transmission
option message_level &#039;2&#039;
/etc/init.d/trasnmission start</code></pre></div><p>After launch <strong>logread</strong>, you can see something like:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Sat Mar 28 22:02:53 2015 daemon.err transmission-daemon[1445]: UDP Failed to set receive buffer: requested 4194304, got 327680 (tr-udp.c:78)

					<p>I have Transmission running on my TP-Link WL1043ND (64mb) router using Gargoyle. (GUI on top of OpenWRT) Transmission was working ok until I gave it some torrents to download. It was then crashing constantly and restarting etc. If it lasted 10 minutes it was doing well....</p><p>I used &quot;logread&quot; on the command line and found the memory error you list above. I followed your instructions and corrected it and found it to improve things a little but I had an additional problem. I realized that my router wasn&#039;t using a swap file. I checked this by using &quot;free&quot;. Swap size was 0! I had my USB hard disk formatted to Ext 4 (which made a huge improvement over NTFS which was real slow) and a swap partition setup but it wasn&#039;t being used.</p><p>Obviously it has to be manually enabled. On the command:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; vi /etc/config/fstab<br /> Make sure that the option under swap is set to 1. Restart the router and check by typing free. It should indicate a swap partition size more than 0. Mine did and now that the swap is properly working I have found Transmission to be reliable and no longer freezing the router. I have 4 downloading at full speed (about 1mb per second) and about 25 seeding. Only about six are actually uploading through. But all is good and working properly even though cpu usage is high. (1.2)</p><p>Transmission needs quite a lot of memory and that memory needs to be set up properly. I have learnt the hard way on this. If any one out there is having the same problems I have had then hope this helps.</p>									</div>
