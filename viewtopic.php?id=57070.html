					<p>You seem to state that you want to bridge the WAN and LAN interfaces; I&#039;m unsure why you would want to do that: can you elaborate?</p><p>Maybe I&#039;m not understanding what you&#039;re trying to achieve (a diagram would help), but I would hazard a guess that you mean to have the Ubuntu host on the LAN side of the OpenWRT VM rather than the WAN side.&nbsp; LAN would be host-only (unless you have a second network card in your host.)</p>									</div>
