					<p>I recently moved in with a couple friends who already have a network infrastructure setup.&nbsp; However, the wireless portion is only 802.11b leaving me with a slower than desired connection.&nbsp; I would like to add my WRT54Gv4 as an access point into the network, while still being on their network.&nbsp; </p><p>I would like to connect my WRT54Gv4 via 1 of the 4 LAN interfaces to the current network switch.&nbsp; I want to be able to authenticate wireless connections via my WRT54Gv4 and user the WAN interface as a management port on a separate LAN.&nbsp; </p><p>Is this possible with OpenWRT, and if so, has anyone tried?&nbsp; How did you go about setting something like this up?</p>									</div>
