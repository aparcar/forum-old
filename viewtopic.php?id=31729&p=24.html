					<p>Hi All</p><p>I&#039;m the guy (his old man in fact) who &quot;threw&quot; the gadget at JetBot and said &quot;make it work&quot; because I had a little time away from work with things to do and figured the self professed computer whizz could sort it out. Very dissapointed.</p><p>Anyhow, enough of family issues.</p><p>The WR703N was presented to me by a guy I work with who had seen the Edimax Nano Router I use when overseas and bought the WR703N on e-bay because it was cheaper, he&#039;s also an Apple device fan but I don&#039;t hold that against him. Given his inability to read the &quot;Chinese only&quot; warning on the e-bay advert you&#039;d be shocked if you knew what he does for a living.</p><p>I maintain aircraft avionics systems for a living and whilst not a self professed computer whizz I can usually sort out any issues presented to me as in my past I have scripted a little here and there.</p><p>That said heres my problem.</p><p>I figured there would be a replacement firmware out there somewhere and was in a little bit of a rush. As Open WRT was the first one that seemed to offer a solution I flashed the appropriate firmware on the WR703N using PUTTY run on my Windows 7 laptop.</p><p>Following the guide I then set up the root password, turned on the wireless and set a WPA password for the wireless again all using PUTTY running on a Windows 7 Laptop.</p><p>All appeared well and I could connect my Windows 7 laptop to it wirelessly and through it access the internet. Then I tried to connect my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 to it and it connected to it after having asked for the WPA password. Same for my Samsung Galaxy S2 cell phone. Good so far you would have thought, not so. Whilst my windows 7 laptop could access the internet through the WR703N my Tab and cell phone can not. It did not matter in which order I connected them only my laptop would access the internet through the WR703N.</p><p>For info the accommodation in which we were staying had a broadband modem with a LAN connection output that I could use. The broadband modem has no router capability.</p><p>When using my Edimax Nano Router all wirelessly connected devices could access the internet. So I figured in someway the WR703N is not handling mutiple devices correctly.</p><p>When I got home to UK and connected the WR703N to my modem/router at home all is well, but when I dig a little deeper I find whilst the mutiple devices are accessing the internet whilst connected wirelessly to the WR703N the actual handling is been carried out by my modem/router, my modem/router is issuing the devices their IP addressess, etc.</p><p>At this point I realised I needed to instal LUCI so I could see what was going on a little easier, this is when it got complicated, for me at least.<br />I think essentially the WR703N can&#039;t access the internet to download stuff to it as when I enter</p><p>opkg update</p><p>all I get is </p><p>unable to find downloads.openwrt.org</p><p>I&#039;ve tried to configure the WR703N along the lines of</p><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />which I found on another forum but to no avail.</p><p>So essentially I&#039;m at the limit of my network knowledge.</p><p>What I really need is a package that I can use from my Windows 7 laptop that will just flash the WR703N with the firmware and a web interface in one go. Or failing that that I need someone to explain it to me in non network guru terms so I can sort it. Then I can give it back to the gent who dropped it in my lap.</p><p>Guys, sorry for the online profanity used by JetBot and any help you can give me would be most appreciated.</p><p>As an incentive, once its working I&#039;ll tell you what its buyer does for a living.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Veri-Gash</strong> on 1 Apr 2012, 00:31)</p>

					<p>@johan666</p><p>Wow. long time since I &#039;ve been called a dummy.</p><p>In all honesty I don&#039;t want to become an expert, networks are not my field of expertise and I don&#039;t wish them to be.

Lots of people in that Linux User Group did just that and in my opinion thats one of the things that held Linux back here in the UK as an operating system. In those days, some will remember, it was all command line installation and configuration, god forbid you wanted it to play music and the groans of agony when you tried to install it on a laptop. Its has been seen over here in the UK for many years as a novelty operating system to be used by, dare I say it. geeks and nerds (of which I proudly consider myself a member) and is only now recovering from that, thanks mostly to people becoming aware of its embedded offshoots and the hard work of a lot of Linux User Groups over here with the right attitude.</p><p>Its a basic rule I think, if you want someone to get involved with your hobby or field of interest, insulting them is probably not the best way to leave a good impression.</p><p>As for OpenWRT been the wrong choice and DD-WRT may have been better, I can now only agree.
