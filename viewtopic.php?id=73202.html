					<p>What version of OpenWrt are you running? Wifi drivers for this device have evolved a lot since the last stable release; have a look at davidc502 builds at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64949,">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=64949,</a> or upgrade to latest LEDE (and eventually also to latest drivers at <a href="https://forum.lede-project.org/t/pre-compiled-updated-mwlwifi-drivers-for-stable-releases/3262).">https://forum.lede-project.org/t/pre-co … ses/3262).</a></p>									</div>
