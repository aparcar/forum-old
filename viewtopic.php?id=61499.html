					<p>First, i explain what i want to do:</p><p>-Have Barrier Breaker 14.07 running on a TP-Link TL-WDR4300.</p><p>-Travel a lot and connect WIFI interface as &quot;client&quot; to different networks, sometimes particular, sometimes hotels, restaurants, etc.</p><p>-Need to have and internet domain or ip directly to my router, to acces Samba, torrent, and other services from wan, no matter where i am staying.</p><p>Outgoing route is: </p><p>PC/PHONE/TABLET -&gt;&gt; TP-link OpenWRT -&gt;&gt; WAN ROUTER -&gt;&gt; Internet</p><p>Works fine everywhere, downloading and uploading OK.</p><p>My problem is the ingoing route.</p><p>-If i use a ddns service, my external IP will be the Wan router one. Obiously i don&#039;t have acces to do port mapping on those routers.</p><p>-I remember that hamachi does a dynamic mapping, and traces the route from point to point, no need to configure anything.</p><p>-I think about OpenVPN but, once again, i can&#039;t acces the router beacause i could only have the external wan IP, and don&#039;t know how to acces trough NAT.</p><p>Thanks in advance! Hope that someone had the same problem and solved it.</p>									</div>

					<p><a href="http://www.tinc-vpn.org/">Tinc</a> is what most closely resembles Hamachi, from what I know. It is available as an OpenWrt package. Their website also has lots of examples for various scenarios.</p><p>I think you will need to create a Tinc node on a node you can access from the Internet (e.g. a VPS). To form a connection, some publicly accessible node must be available. If none of two nodes can receive incoming connections, those two nodes cannot form any kind of connection - they need a middle man to link them together, once that is done the two nodes can communicate directly. With Hamachi, Teamviewer and other platforms that offer services that bypass NAT, these services function as the middle man - they receive connections from both nodes, point them to each other and leave them to their business. You need to set up a similar middle man service (in practice a Tinc node, OpenVPN server or similar on a host that can receive incoming connections).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makro</strong> on 14 Dec 2015, 00:43)</p>

					<div class="quotebox"><cite>lord_of_metal wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>-I think about OpenVPN</p></blockquote></div><p>I think that would be the easiest route to go about it. Create an OpenVPN server in your own infrastructure (ideally also an OpenWrt router on the WAN side), have your mobile OpenWrt router be the client. No need to worry about incoming traffic through the hotel&#039;s (or similar) WAN router, once the tunnel is established incoming traffic goes through the tunnel.</p><p>Also, it would serve as an additional layer of privacy, you never know about a public infrastructure and who might be listening in. Personally, I prefer to have all the traffic go through that tunnel when I&#039;m out and about.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 14 Dec 2015, 03:11)</p>
