					<p>I&#039;ve ported RedBoot to the WRV54G which is a very similar unit also based on OpenRG. This should be a similar effort. Let me know if your interested in doing the port, I may be able to help out.</p>									</div>

					<p>I sent the unit to the developer and he received it.&nbsp; He will start working on it in a couple of days.&nbsp; He is busy with family now, which is more important then any router.&nbsp; He is a good guy and will start it soon and once he is completed he will let us all know.&nbsp; He seems very confident about his abilities to make it work, which is great.&nbsp; It will be good having a dual wan router with big memory supported.&nbsp; I will keep you posted.</p>									</div>

					<p>As David stated above, he sent me an RV082. I plan to do a port next month. The main task is figuring out the GPIO assignments. I&#039;ve already created prototype code for both RedBoot and initial patches for OpenWrt. So, now it&#039;s a matter of reverse engineering the hardware connections and codifying them in the appropriate places; this should be similar to my ports of <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/mi424wr">MI424-WR</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrv54g">WRV54G</a>.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cherry31459</strong> on 19 Aug 2010, 22:58)</p>
