					<p>I just purchased the above mini router and am trying to install purevpn on it.&nbsp; I&#039;m clueless when you start talking packages, command lines, etc.&nbsp; Can anyone walk me through in English with clear step by baby step instructions on installing purevpn on this router?&nbsp; I would be eternally grateful, Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>aportugee</strong>, you can follow my <a href="https://airvpn.org/topic/20303-airvpn-configuration-on-openwrt-preventing-traffic-leakage-outside-tunnel/">AirVPN guide</a> with corresponding modifications. Stock firmware is custom OpenWRT, it contains specific interface for OpenVPN-client, you can use it also, my manual is applicable too.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 8 Jun 2017, 23:49)</p>

					<p>ulmwind;&nbsp; Thank you for your post and instructions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don&#039;t understand the directions.&nbsp; I know how to go to 192.168.8.1 to access my router and I know to input the username and password of my purevpn account but; I don&#039;t know which files to download to the system or where to get each particular file and/or, is there a specific order to install them?&nbsp; I tried downloading what I thought were the necessary files from purevpn but; got a message that the certificate wasn&#039;t unlocked and then it didn&#039;t seem that I could unzip the last file that was included.&nbsp; I&#039;m totally lost.&nbsp; Is that just to complicated for a newbe or is there somewhere I can go with very, very simple and specific directions?&nbsp; Thanks again for your patience.</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>aportugee</strong>, you can login to your router via web-interface; you also can login to it by ssh, using putty in Windows. In custom firmware there is item like &quot;Additional settings&quot;, clicking it you get standard OpenWRT-interface. Can you login using putty? You should download files <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/heartbleed/linux/linux-files.zip">here</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>ulmwind;&nbsp; Do you mean I can log in via web-interface but; I NEED to log in via Putty instead? I know how to log in via web-interface.&nbsp; </p><p>Also, I have downloaded those files before but; when I unzip them I have a problem.&nbsp; The file ca says something about the certificate not being recognized and then I go through a clicking in windows process where eventually it says Windows assigned it a &quot;store&quot; based on the type of certificate. Then on the &quot;Wdc&quot; file, I get a &quot;class not registered&quot; message and when I click on OK, I get a message that &quot;Windows cannot complete the extraction. The destination file could not be created.&quot; </p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Many thanks...</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>aportugee</strong>, yes, web-interface, can you find item like &quot;Additional settings&quot;? It is link to full-functional native OpenWRT-interface.</p><p>In my manual you should connect via ssh, and make all settings via command line. It is universal approach, to my mind. You should use ca.crt, Wdc.key just for OpenVPN-connection, not for Windows itself.</p><p>Are you familiar with Linux command line?</p>									</div>

					<p>GLi is delivered with a custom image which should have all the files one needs to run OpenVpn including configs for most VPN services.&nbsp; You should not have to install anything to make this work.&nbsp; Basically you should be choosing your service and supplying credentials to make this work.</p><p>Reading this post it appears that the OP is using the GLI GUI and thus will not see the (Services=&gt;OpenVPN=&gt;) Additional Settings or similar.&nbsp; OP has not indicated that he has found the stock OpenWrt menus (Advanced Configuration in the GLi GUI&#039;s upper right) and will not be seeing the LuCi GUI </p><p>You should post on the GLi forum, and make sure you include what version of firmware is on your device.&nbsp; You can find this on the main GLi GUI page.</p>									</div>

					<p>The &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; is correct, and it will take you to the Standard OpenWrt menus which ulmwind has been referring to.</p><p>If you open the linux-files which ulmwind referred to in post 4 you will find folders UDP and TCP which contain OpenVPN files for the various servers.&nbsp; Not sure of the source, but I assume he sourced these from PureVpn.</p><p>On the GLi menu click the OpenVPN tab on the far right.&nbsp; While it says drag the opvn file to the box, it appears it wants a single zip file with the openvpn file and key.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is the best I can offer.</p>									</div>
