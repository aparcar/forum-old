					<p>One of the packages I maintain on <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/packages">https://github.com/openwrt/packages</a> fails on mpc85xx and some x86 archs since recently, obviously because of some problem with argp-standalone. In compile.txt on Buildbot Broken Packages it ends with:</p><p>checking argp.h usability... yes<br />checking argp.h presence... yes<br />checking for argp.h... yes<br />checking for library containing argp_parse... no<br />configure: error: argp_parse not found</p><p>On all other current trunk archs the package still builds fine (again after some solved compatibility issues with musl).</p><p>I use a current trunk based toolchain for mpc85xx myself and cannot see the same problem. Indeed it compiles fine and says:</p><p>checking for library containing argp_parse... -largp</p><p>So I think there must be a problem with building argp-standalone on Buildbot for mpc85xx and some x86 archs but I cannot find any indication for that in the stdio of the building logs because logs are truncated. Who can take care of that?</p><p>Can that be related to core Changeset 45967: argp-standalone: import package from packages.git ??<br />Until a few weeks ago my mainained package built fine also on mpc85xx.</p>									</div>
