					<p>hi folks<br />ive got some problems with the wlan-function on my whole new WRT54GL...</p><p>with the original drivers everything works fine both the stock and the newest firmware. so i first tried to install openwrt and (some hours later) it worked - except the wlan, which wont work (as i allready wrote). anything else works seems to work fine but as im dependent on wlan ive got no benefits from this. the only difference between 2.4 and 2.6 kernel is the wlan-LED: with 2.4 its active, with 2.6 inactive.</p><p>so i tried the same with x-wrt (its not a fork, i know...) but issues keep pretty much the same (regarding wlan)...</p><p>theres no difference if i use WEP, WPA or any other setting - my WRT54GL isnt sending out any (wlan) signals. anyone out there who possibly know why? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>(yeah, my english isnt the best. complaints address to my teachers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />)</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi everybody,</p><p>I&#039;m pretty new to all this... have some experience with Linux, Routing, Masq, Networking... so I tried two days ago to set up my WRT54GL with the Kamikaze 8.09... as described at <a href="http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs(2f)Hardware(2f)Linksys(2f)WRT54GL.html">http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs( â€¦ T54GL.html</a> </p><p>I first installed 2.4 Kernel and did the NVRAM...<br />Than I upgraded to 2.6 Kernel, but as posted the Wireless Lan is not working (wl0 is not presented in ifconfig)...<br />Downgrading to 2.4 Kernel and everything is working fine...</p><p>I used the latest available download (for both Kernel versions)... Is 2.6 not working wit Wireless on WRT54GL... </p><p>Could someone just make this point clear for me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />... Or could someone describe a little bit more detailed what to do to make 2.6 work with WRT54GL?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I don&#039;t know what:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Even with 2.4 Kernel, Kamikaze does not make use of NVRAM.</p></blockquote></div><p>means for the wireless problem... but at least I can use the nvram command with Kernel 2.4 and not with 2.6 (there it says: nvram unknown command)...</p><p>But I found my mistake using 2.6 and wireless by reading further post about wireless and WRT54GL... when you refalsh to 2.6 you have to unmark the checkbox &quot;Keep configuration...&quot;, cause the wl0 device does not exist anymore... After reflashing to Kamikaze 8.09 (with Kernel 2.6) from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm47xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm47xx/</a> I just ask myself know is that the best choice? There are so many post with different opinions about this... should I maybe use the snapshot? Or maybe 2.4?</p>									</div>

Cause the configuration is quite different... the wireless device is renamed in 2.6 so that the configuration of 2.4 cannot work... so 2.4 works for you and if you check ifconfig (or iwconfig) you&#039;ll get wl0 as interface? </p><p>In 2.6 you should have three interfaces checking ifconfig (or iwconfig)... the wlan0, wmaster0 and mon.wlan0... I don&#039;t know how to force the system to flash also the configuration for sure... maybe someone else can help in this case???</p>									</div>
