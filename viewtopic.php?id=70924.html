					<p>Hi;</p><p>It was my understanding that dnsmasq listens to all interfaces by default.</p><p>my openwrt router is a vpn (tun) server and, I am connecting to android. The purpose is to bypass a symmetric NAT on my cellular data plan, for SIP applications. The vpn is working, all but DNS from my router.</p><p>in my server.conf (openwrt) is push &quot;dhcp-option DNS 192.168.1.1 which is honored by Android (first DNS attempt to 192.168.1.1)</p><p>my router hostname is SecureOffice</p><p>which I can see with &quot;tcpdump -i tun0 port 53&quot; which shows (ping yahoo.com):</p><p>IP 10.0.1.6.56241 &gt; SecureOffice.lan.domain: 11472+ A? yahoo.com. (27) (no response from router, android then tries google server)<br />IP 10.0.1.6.46056 &gt; google-public-dns-a.google.com.domain: 11472+ A? yahoo.com. (27)<br />IP google-public-dns-a.google.com.domain &gt; 10.0.1.6.46056: 11472 3/0/0 A 98.139.183.24, A 206.190.36.45, A 98.138.253.109 (75)</p><p>I have researched this and cannot figure out how to get dnsmasq to respond to DNS queries from vpn.</p><p>tried:<br />- &quot;ACCEPT&quot; rule for vpn, port 53 in firewall<br />- /etc/config/dhcp: logqueries &#039;1&#039; (dnsmasq not seeing requests)<br />- /etc/config/dhcp: option localservice &#039;1&#039;<br />- /etc/config/dhcp: option local &#039;/vpn0/&#039;</p><p>Anyone have any ideas how to debug / fix this? I need to get an /etc/hosts entry served by DNS over vpn</p><p>Thanks;<br />Bill</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rossb</strong> on 17 May 2017, 17:34)</p>

					<p>thanks, already caught that, now at &#039;0&#039;</p><p>This seems to also solve a race condition.

					<p>done that, network, dnsmasq, firewall about a zillion times no change...</p><p>Since I can see the DNS queries and responses on localhost, the problem is: why are DNS responses not making it to vpn? and, how to debug this? Nothing dropped in firewall log</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, in hindsight: do not believe /etc/config/dhcp is &quot;reality&quot;. Look at the autogenerated /var/etc/dnsmasq.conf file for &quot;reality&quot;</p><p>Problem was I had a spurious &quot;interface=br-lan&quot; in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, omitting vpn as a listen interface.</p><p>FYI, the problem I was attempting to solve was my cellular carrier blessed me with a new &quot;feature&quot; (symmetric NAT), which breaks VOIP requiring a third party TURN server, which basically proxies all traffic, messing up VOIP latencies.</p><p>Rather than forcing TURN servers on&nbsp; VOIP clients, I opted for VPN. It is required by my SIP switch that domain based addressing be used. Hence, when SIP devices connect locally (Wired, WIFI, VPN), domain must resolve to internal server address. When &quot;in the wild&quot;, domain must resolve to public IP of server.</p>									</div>
