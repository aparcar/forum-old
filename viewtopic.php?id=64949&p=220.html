It&#039;s a smart plug that only works on 2.4band. It tries to connect but never gets there. I have an old router connected lan to lan with the 3200 and if I turn on 2.4 on that it will connect fine. So it appears to be something about the 2.4 itself. I&#039;ve tried wpa2, wpa2 mixed. N mode, legacy and all combos I can think of. Any suggestions? Every thing else that can connect by 2.4 seems ok.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here is my experience with the 3200acm. In order to connect with the smart plug on 2.4G, I have to just use legacy mode and uncheck the WMM (wireless multimedia). However with this configuration I can only get a few hundred KB download speed with other devices.<br />In DD-WRT, you can enable the third radio (BT/WiFi combo) and there is no issue for smart plug to connect to it while the main 8964 2.4G radio can be configured to be useful.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks everyone for the responses. Based on this I set legacy and no wmm <br />And it connected. Then turned on wmm and it stayed connected. Then enabled n mode and it again stayed connected. Tried it a couple of times and it still works! Hope this helps others having this issue.thanks again</p>									</div>

					<p>@AddRemover you forgot an edit4 to remove your nonsense of &quot;if the goal is to remove annoying logs from dnsmasq, it&#039;s better disable logging, rather than disable IPv6&quot;. Goal to remove logs? ... : D Dnsmas reloading configs IS restarting. And It happens like every 5-20 minutes and like 3 times in a row every time, which I DONT WANT AND THAT IS THE GOAL. Especially because of using adblock which means it will reload (parse, high cpu usage) 20000 DNS block config logs every time (redundant action) it is reloading configs. It seems there is something wrong with the local ipv6 lease time, or the lease is permanently renewing when a WIFI client connects. I also somehow have problems with this build with my Android devices in idle, they seem to lose connectivity during some time because I dont get any push notifications. I think this WIFI driver wont ever become 100% stable it seems. Also I dont want IPv6 anyway, it is just a mess and I dont need it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makedir</strong> on 12 Apr 2018, 22:48)</p>
