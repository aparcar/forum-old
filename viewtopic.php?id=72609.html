					<p>Hi, <br />I recently unbrick a tp link w8980 by crossflashing a w9980 fw.<br />It works but I have some issue with PPPoE/PPPoA (my provider advice me to set PPPoE/LLC but the router works only with PPPoA/VC and I don&#039;t&nbsp; understand why). So I would like to try openwrt but I need to know if in the recent update the WAVE300 5ghz band is enebled.<br />Thank you in advance</p>									</div>
