					<p>Hello,</p><p>The point is, i found around many people tell is possible to have minimal Asterisk installation on a router also with 2 MB of FLASH, but all topics and blog post are about different models and different version ( older ) of OpenWRT and Asterisk.</p><br /><p>Now i would like to ask, and if someone have some notice or can point me out some tutorial should be very nice, if i can find a Way to install on a TpLink WR841ND a compatible version of OpenWRT with a minimal Asterisk Module.</p><p>I did some experiment:</p><p>1) before i installed default version of OpenWRT and i tried to install the asterisk package but no sufficent space available was</p><p>2) after i built a minimizeed version of Open WRT without LUCI interface, but also in this case i was unable to install Asterisk because too few free space.</p><br /><p>Is someone able to help me ? Someone was able to install Asterisk 1.8&nbsp; on Tp-Link wr841n v8 ?</p><p>Naturally with 8 MB flash rom a firend told me there are no problems, only was my plan to use the cheapest router to create a very small PBX to manage phone calls in my flat.</p><br /><p>Thanks in advance for any help<br />Enrico</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>enricoeur</strong> on 4 Apr 2014, 16:40)</p>

					<p>OpenWrt AA with base asterisk18 package (which consists of chan_sip) should fit in 4 MB Flash, but I can assure you, that it will not fit in a router with 2 MB Flash. </p><p>=&gt; at least 4 MB Flash, at least 32 MB RAM and base asterisk18 package is the way to go</p>									</div>
