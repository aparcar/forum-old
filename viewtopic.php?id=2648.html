					<p>So many questions - a few answers:</p><p>&gt; how to make the &quot;internet port&quot; equal to the 4 lan ports?</p><p>assuming v2 hw or later:<br />unset vlan1 nvram variables<br />add &quot;0&quot; to vlan0ports nvram variable<br />set vlan0_gateway and vlan0_dns if needed</p><p>&gt; Is there a decent intuitive text editor in openwrt?&nbsp; (NOT vid)</p><p>Because of openwrt I&#039;ve finally learned to live with vi.

I&#039;ve been so exasperated with vi at times that I&#039;ve considered porting my own editor to openwrt. It&#039;s only 10k but even it is based on vi style (old &#039;see&#039; editor) but isn&#039;t nearly as insane as vi. I wonder if jed wouldn&#039;t work straight off, although it can be frustrating also?</p><p>to think that I used to edit all day long with line editors on the mf that make vi look like cat&#039;s meow :-) seriously, these editors are much more efficient when you use them day in and day out - they&#039;re only a disaster for light use.</p><p>Oh, and forget about the backspace key, linux doesn&#039;t know about ^h^h^h it, just left arrow and delete (x). but you probably already know this.

					<p>I don&#039;t get any of that anywhere. Backspace and arrows work fine on command line and in vi in both RC2 and RC3. Of course I use OpenSSH on Linux but the Windows clients should work just as good. There definitely must be something wrong with your terminal emulation. The rare times I have to use Windows at work putty has always worked fine too. What clients are you using? As far as WinSCP not working, does it have a choice of using scp or sftp? If so, choose scp. I have never had a problem transferring files with scp (again on Linux). I&#039;ve seen that on Windows using pscp you have to tell it to use &quot;scp&quot; rather than &quot;sftp&quot; because sftp isn&#039;t included in dropbear.

					<p>I have been using vi/vim for 15 years and never once have I used the DEL key in it. DEL is not a vi command which is why you are having that trouble. Putty is working properly. Microsoft&#039;s telnet client is likely broken (normal). In command mode (ESC) if you want to delete one character you use &quot;x&quot; if you want to delete a line you use &quot;dd&quot;. If you want to delete 10 characters you use &quot;10x&quot; if you want to delete 10 lines you use &quot;10dd&quot;. Here&#039;s a vi reference:</p><p><a href="http://drumlin.thehutt.org/vi/">http://drumlin.thehutt.org/vi/</a></p><p>Mind you this is not a full version of vi and is very limited to the full version and extremely limited to vim (by far the best editor on the planet) but there is a reason for that, it has the basic editing functionality and it is very small which is important on a limited resource device like the WRT. But it&#039;s amazing how much functionality they do get into it along with all the other commands that are built in to the busybox binary. I mean one 500k binary contains all of these commands:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ash -&gt; busybox
cat -&gt; busybox
chgrp -&gt; busybox
chmod -&gt; busybox
chown -&gt; busybox
cp -&gt; busybox
date -&gt; busybox
dd -&gt; busybox
df -&gt; busybox
dmesg -&gt; busybox
echo -&gt; busybox
egrep -&gt; busybox
false -&gt; busybox
fgrep -&gt; busybox
grep -&gt; busybox
gunzip -&gt; busybox
gzip -&gt; busybox
ipcalc -&gt; busybox
kill -&gt; busybox
ln -&gt; busybox
ls -&gt; busybox
mkdir -&gt; busybox
mktemp -&gt; busybox
more -&gt; busybox
mount -&gt; busybox
mv -&gt; busybox
netstat -&gt; busybox
pidof -&gt; busybox
ping -&gt; busybox
ping6 -&gt; busybox
ps -&gt; busybox
pwd -&gt; busybox
rm -&gt; busybox
rmdir -&gt; busybox
sed -&gt; busybox
sh -&gt; busybox
sleep -&gt; busybox
sync -&gt; busybox
tar -&gt; busybox
touch -&gt; busybox
true -&gt; busybox
umount -&gt; busybox
uname -&gt; busybox
vi -&gt; busybox
zcat -&gt; busybox</code></pre></div><p>If you put the full real version of all of those commands it would never fit on the WRT. The bash shell alone is bigger than all of the above commands combined with busybox.</p>									</div>

					<p>I guess the BS key is another one I never use in vi (I use &#039;h&#039;).&nbsp; I am also on FC4 but only tested SSH since that&#039;s the first thing I turn on after installing WRT. What&#039;s the TERM variable set to when logging in? Mine is set to &#039;xterm&#039; in SSH. It might not be detecting your terminal when using telnet. If you are in an xterm (or gnome-termain/konsole/etc) set try setting your TERM variable to xterm after logging in:</p><p>export TERM=xterm</p><p>On Windows you might try:</p><p>export TERM=vt100</p><p>Just a thought. Like I said though, it is an extremely limited version of vi and has just the very basic command set. The only thing I really miss in it is undo (u). But then it&#039;s not like you are going to be doing word processing on your WRT.

					<p>How can I ssh and telnet daemons both to work or revert back to telnet? I know when you set a password it disables telnet which is fine but for this kind of testing it would be nice to have both. I am sure I could figure it out pretty quickly.
