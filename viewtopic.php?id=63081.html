					<p>Hi and thanks do those who support opensource development!</p><p>I flashed my wrt1200ac with: </p><p>openwrt-15.05-mvebu-armada-385-linksys-caiman-squashfs-factory.img</p><p>Followed the instructions carefully! The router performed fine with the Stock Firmware.</p><p>The first thing we notice is the the wlan comes to a crawl. The lan still transfers data fine but pinging the router and other lan devices performs very poorly. Pinging from the router to devices on the network is fine. I perform software reboot via Luci and still have the same issue. I cycle power and it comes back strong a gain.</p><p>No, it is not my modem. The network is soggy. Never did this until flashing with openwrt. I know it is my network by pinging all over within the lan/wan reveals it and it&#039;s not every device on my network either it&#039;s openwrt. I have done very little by the way of configuration. Just enabled wlan</p><p>I am considering going back to stock and then to dd-wrt. I have read about some issues with dd-wrt too. The stock firmware doesn&#039;t have Luci. I love Luci and really don&#039;t want to dump her.</p><p>I also looked at the log and tried to capture the moment of the malfunction. First I cd to /var/log and found nothing. I searched and found logread. Works pretty good. I like the regex capability. I would like to know what to parse for?</p><p>Also, I tried to look at the &quot;trunk&quot; to find upgrades but it is unavailable. It gives me an nginx error.</p><p>Any suggestions are appreciated.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Mike</p><p>So, what I did was flash back to OEM firmware and then to dd-wrt. I just did it. Initial performance is on par. I will update with performance after putting it under some load for a couple of days. I like Luci a lot more than the dd-wrt interface. I have 5 kids and a wife whom I am trying to keep satisfied. I really can&#039;t afford to much downtime. So much of our lives count on dependable access to the Net. My wife&#039;s work and my kids school work. As for me I am a disabled Industrial Automation Technician and Applications Engineer. My health doesn&#039;t allow me to work so I tinker. I have a server running bind9, one running Postfix, and one with Apache2. I didn&#039;t like the Stock Linksys Firmware. It had some issues that openwrt resolved. It&#039;s too bad that it didn&#039;t perform as well as stock did. I really like it accept for the Network performance issue I experienced. I am learning a lot about linux and hope to be able to work on some projects in the future. I would love to help with openwrt. Maybe I can get my feet wet here!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mroussin51</strong> on 2 Mar 2016, 08:24)</p>

					<p>Hey trustno1foxm. Thanks for nothing. You should start your own thread if you want to bump your gums with useless information. If you have a comment that is actually of some sort of value to users and developers please do share. Otherwise please keep your mouth closed. There is already plenty of useless information on the internet. Thanks for nothing.</p><p>To all others. There is a bug in the openwrt stable release firmware for the wrt1200ac. I have flash dd-wrt and it is performing well again. I am going to purchase another wrt1200ac and hunt it down and fix it. I really like openwrt better than dd-wrt but currently can&#039;t have the downtime since it is our main router. My old router gave up the ghost so I only have one on hand.</p><p>Also, note that I flashed back to linksys firmware and thoroughly tested connections prior to flashing dd-wrt. I did that due to the fact that the hardware may have been failing even though it is a fairly new router. Needless to say it did well and only after ruling out a hardware issue I flashed dd-wrt. To users of the wrt1200ac. The linksys firmware is fine unless you need to have more specialized function. I don&#039;t recommend changing if the router already does what you need it to do. In other words, if it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it. I have an Engineering back ground and live by that motto.</p><p>One thing I should have done is a reset before disbanding openwrt. For now dd-wrt is working. When I get another wrt1200ac I will do more extensive troubleshooting. I got some errors on the logread but didn&#039;t do anything that verified timing. I&#039;ll whip up a shell script that will capture the moment if I have the same issue.</p><p>Thanks for providing the sha256 checksum. Linksys did not provide one that I could find. I was leery about that. Also, couldn&#039;t easily find it on dd-wrt website. Didn&#039;t like that either.</p><p>Thanks to all of your opensource support the world is a better place. Thanks developers and those of you that provide technical expertise. I appreciate you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mroussin51</strong> on 3 Mar 2016, 03:35)</p>
