					<p>I&#039;ve recently purchased a Xiaomi MiWiFi Mini <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/xiaomi/mini">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/xiaomi/mini</a> , the official firmware doesn&#039;t support VLAN tagging so I followed the guide in the wiki to install the OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 ( i was going to use OpenWRT anyway since i&nbsp; doesn&#039;t trust Chinese software). I was able to get an internet connection via PPPoE and VLAN tagging rather quickly.&nbsp; However i wasn&#039;t able to get IPTV running after a few hours of attempt, out of frustration i went to reset the settings. now I fucked up even more, I cant even get the PPPoE working. I tried various things but I has been stuck with a bunch of &quot;Unable to complete PPPoE discovery&quot; in the system log for 2 days while i am still able to use my old router to establish a connection.</p><p>Things that I had attempted,</p><p>- changing the MAC address for the WAN interface that I use to establish the PPPoE address by editing /etc/config/network<br />- instead of using the default WAN port on router, I tried to do VLAN tagging on a different LAN port to make sure the WAN port isn&#039;t broken in the first place.<br />- disconnecting the PPPoE gracefully before attempting to plug the WAN cable to the new router<br />- restarting the BTU and router </p><p>It is driving me crazy... I am pretty sure i did the same thing as the first attempt (unless i am wrong).</p><p>Is there anyway for me to narrow down the issue?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>megablue</strong> on 6 Jan 2016, 03:33)</p>
