					<p>I was replied.. I here quote him to fill in some gaps..</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>i contributed back the wireless drivers for 2.4 kernels back to openwrt a long time ago which are also supporting the WRT610 series. for 2.6 kernels you have to delete the whole openwrt 2.6 kernels and to use ours, since we are not using the opensource wireless drivers and mac80211.<br />the everything required for supporting the 2.6 propertiery drivers is not included in openwrt. but feel free todo anything you want. the sources for my 2.6 kernel is published as well as the binaries for the broadcom drivers</p></blockquote></div><p>This means that we need to use kernel from dd-wrt, we can forget about openwrt specific modules that might not be available for dd-wrt and so on.. But I think this is a starting point; my wrt610n is in the box and ain&#039;t being used.. Maybe someday brcm4322 is backported and available, but not today..</p><p>Next, I asked about origin of these drivers..<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>i have a NDA signed with broadcom since a long time (like i have with atheros, marvell, realtek and ralink). originally broadcom supplied only the 2.4 kernels. but the latest driver versions contained already 2.6 kernel support and together with a patch supplied from cisco i was able to<br />create the 2.6 kernel with support for mainly newer devices, since broadcom supports only them on 2.6. the rest was homebrew work. i simply added kernel support for older devices. the driver itself did already support older chipsets.<br />the driver contains also some home modifications for noack and acktiming support etc. as well as some regulatory changes to allow ht40 in europe<br />consider that you need also todo evil hacks to get the switch to work with the tigon / robo switch driver</p></blockquote></div><p>Hope this information gets us somewhere..</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you definetly should contact brainslayer, he wrote me again and has been very helpful and thorough with every question I&#039;ve so far had, he just wrote me that he thinks that our problem is that they use 2.6.23 which he considers stable (he had troubles with newer kernels) - and as we only get a binary.. Actually, I&#039;d better to quote him again as following information propably is pretty much crucial while creating openwrt wrt610n image..</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>the problem is that i dont think that you get such a change merged to the openwrt upstream. the philosophie of openwrt is that everything must be opensource and the broadcom wireless driver for dd-wrt is not opensource in any way (which is not my fault for sure)<br />and our used kernel is also far back behind openwrt. we are using 2.6.23 which is a stable kernel for me which makes no issues. (i had too many issues with newer kernels, so i decided to stay on it until there is a real reason to change)<br />the 2.6.24.111 version number has a curious background. since we backported alot of napi changes from newer kernels so we needed to change this number to get driver sources to compile since the newer napi api was introduced in 2.6.24<br />so in fact is a 2.6.23 with alot of backports, hacks and changes.</p></blockquote></div><p>I&#039;ll ask him about the license..</p>									</div>

					<p>We had this conversation about license/right to use it..</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&gt;I was needing to ask you about license for those drivers, because people working on this are concerned about legal issues while using these drivers - I quoted you on &gt;the forum and they were worried that it might be that license only applies for dd-wrt firmware and that&#039;s it. I promised that I would still bug you with this issue and ask &gt;about legality of using drivers in openwrt firmware..<br />&nbsp; <br />its propertiery. so i&#039;m not allowed to publish any sourcecode of it. but anyone is able to take my binaries. but effectifly its not my license. its broadcoms. so i&#039;m not sure if i can really answer the question truthfully.<br />so its your decision which way you go. i cannot give you any guarantee. but as in the past as we where taking linksys binary drivers for the 2.4 kernel nothing would have changed. so basicly the same license applies as for the binary drivers within the 2.4 kernel<br />but something must be also considered. my main interest is in developing dd-wrt and not openwrt. so i can give some help. but i have also to look on my side, since i want for sure&nbsp; that dd-wrt is used by as many people as possible. even if its free for these devices</p></blockquote></div><p>So - look for the license can be forgotten - it&#039;s not available. And what comes to legality issue here.. It&#039;s just as he said. We need to think and decide if we can say that same license applies which was for broadcom 2.4 propertiery drivers. It&#039;s not us to decide if it is so, but most likely - broadcom does nothing about this - and that is as close as we get to a proper license.. I cannot say anything to this, as I own such device and because of that I would love to get it working with openwrt.. So I don&#039;t think I have an objective view to this issue - but on the other end - from all people who are interested and/or caring.. Most propably none of these people do have..</p><p>So.. Should there be a poll or should someone just say it out loud that we/him/her takes advantage of previous license and connects it to this driver?</p>									</div>

The only correct way would be to ask Broadcom&#039;s legal department.<br />But before doing that, I would like to play with the code a bit to get a feel of what would it mean to get it working on WRT-610N. As Brainslayer stated, it probably won&#039;t be easy...<br />I have pretty good idea what needs to be done for 2.4 kernel, and it&#039;s just because of lack of time I haven&#039;t got anything working yet. For 2.6, I have no idea so far whether at least wired net would be working or not. I will try to spare some time soon to get a better picture and report back.</p><p>BTW, thanks a lot for the info from the DD-WRT world, its quite interesting :-).</p>									</div>

					<p>I started to build my own openwrt image for wrt610n - I used svn to fetch kernel sources used in dd-wrt image.

					<p>I contacted BrainSlayer and he assisted me that wl_apsta must be used. Although I changed configurations, I wasn&#039;t able to select it as driver target - therefore I made a dirty hack to sources to force it to choose wl_apsta as target and now I have been able to compile kernel. Yet, there is no driver in the image as I haven&#039;t made it a package so it won&#039;t be installed to the image. Also there are some other problems as well, even though I would be able to succesfully create a image, there&#039;s a possibility that it won&#039;t be bootable at all simply because there might be problems with the init scripts and as I don&#039;t have a serial connection or tools/parts/skills to add one I cannot debug this. But I&#039;ll give here my best shot and maybe publish my progress here so someone else can take then care of parts that I maybe cannot do anything about until device is accessible via telnet/ssh..</p>									</div>

Non-working cable usually does not print anything.<br />Make sure your terminal is set up properly. For WRT610N, the proper serial port settings are 115200kbps, 8 bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control.</p>									</div>

					<p>dd-wrt kernel uses changed if.h - this is why ifconfig doesn&#039;t work - toolchain should use dd-wrt sources as kernel headers. This is harder to accomplish as I thought - I tried to change target wrt610n Makefile, but still no luck. I also tried to change trunk/toolchain/kernel-headers, but still no luck. I have svn tree for dd-wrt&#039;s kernel at trunk/dd-wrt - how do I set up my system to get headers from there?</p>									</div>

					<p>Instruction to create a bootable wrt610n image:-</p><p>1) svn openwrt trunk and chdir to that directory.<br />2) extract wrt610n.tar.gz - this creates dd-wrt directory to trunk’s root and adds wrt610n independent target along<br />with kmod-bcm57xx package.<br />3) fetch dd-wrt kernel’s sources with svn from svn://svn.dd-wrt.com/DD-WRT/src/linux/brcm/linux-2.6.23<br />4) apply patches from target/linux/wrt610n/kernel-patches to kernel sources. One of patches needs to be done manually (don’t worry, it’s only change of one word (dd-wrt -&gt; rootfs_data))<br />5) remove madwifi from kernel sources, as <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Building_From_Source">http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Bu … rom_Source</a> instructs. It’s in file trunk/dd-wrt/drivers/net/wireless/Kconfig. You need to edit it with text editor.<br />6) execute touch dl/linux-2.6.23.tar.bz2 in trunk (file must exist, even though we use external sources)<br />7) link trunk/dd-wrt/include/linux/config.h points to wrong location. Make it point to same folders file autoconf.h<br />8) DEBUG_FS is set on by default on openwrt build system - this must be set off or kernel won’t compile succesfully.<br />9) go to <a href="http://candox.co.cc/openwrt610n/wrt610n.tar.gz">http://candox.co.cc/openwrt610n/wrt610n.tar.gz</a><br />10) i will update a git repos for the openwrt610n kernel 2.6 once i have done up the patch on my computer at gitorious.com</p><p>Good luck. These instructions won’t build a complete image, they build a bootable image.<br />There is no ethernet working or wireless properly working (actually, wireless scan for example IS POSSIBLE with binaries to software that performs the scan that are ripped from original dd-wrt image) - the main problem at this point is that dd-wrt’s kernel has different if.h and openwrt doesn’t use dd-wrt’s kernel sources as kernel headers - therefore uclibc and busybox get to compile incorrectly and ifconfig for example doesn’t work as there are wrong ioctls and so on..</p><p>This has been verified, I added dd-wrt’s busybox binary as /bin/busybox2 and made a link in /tmp to it with name ifconfig - and voila, it was able to define addresses and show interfaces - even so, I wasn’t able to ping to lan..</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys, currently i am trying to build a workable image for wrt610n, I should be able to upload the customized trunk tree by the end of next Tuesday. I will link up the trunk once i am done. Currently there is&nbsp; some issues with my configuration . Will fix it asap and hopefully this device could work.&nbsp; Many thanks to jake1981 for contributing the instruction for the initial setup.&nbsp; Lastly we really need guys to come and help.
