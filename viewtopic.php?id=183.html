					<p>Hi</p><p>What does it mean when the Power LED starts to flash quickly? A reboot will make it stop doing that.</p><p>It&#039;s not described on <a href="http://openwrt.ksilebo.net/wrtLEDCodes">http://openwrt.ksilebo.net/wrtLEDCodes</a> - I have checked.</p><p>The DMZ light doesn&#039;t change state. It&#039;s off and remains that way. Only the Power LED flashes.</p><p>Hope someone can help.</p>									</div>

					<p>As &quot;loveless&quot; (from IRC/#wrt54g) also experienced, the Power LED will flash if wrt is not in AP mode.</p><p>Maybe this is wrt&#039;s way of indidcating it&#039;s no longer functioning as AP.</p><p>Issueing &#039;wl ap 0&#039; will make it flash the Power LED.</p><p>Issueing &#039;wl ap 1&#039; will, of course, make it stop.</p><p>At least I now know it&#039;s &quot;harmless&quot;.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have the same problem now.<br />I installed the RC4 two days ago on my Linksys WRT54GS.<br />It works very well, but after about one day online the power LED starts flashing.<br />There is no message in the syslog.<br />The WLAN should not be the problem since I don&#039;t use it (wl0_radio=0) and didn&#039;t change anything when it started flashing.</p><p>Any idea, what the flashing could mean? (I guess there is some meaning.)<br />Which program could have turned it on?</p>									</div>
