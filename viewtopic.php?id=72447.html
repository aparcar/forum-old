					<p>Hi guys.</p><p>I have a wr842n wireless router, with a ppoe connection. Working perfectly with default setup. This is the main router of my network setup. Also, recently, I acquired fiber connection and the ISP give to me a ethernet router. Working perfectly when I use the ethernet connection.&nbsp; </p><p>I want to setup both connections on my wr842n, using 2 different WLANs.&nbsp; I read a bunch of articles and tutorials, but I was unable to make the secondary WLAN communicate with the ethernet router (with the fiber connection). I do not want to use the secondary internet connection as load balancer, I just want to have 2 different WLANs with different WAN connections.</p><p>What I tried:</p><ul><li><p>created a vlans, one for tagging tthe specific ethernet port (Port 1) and other to use with the secondary WLAN</p></li><li><p>creating interfaces using those vlans (with distinct firewall rules)</p></li><li><p>using dhcp client in the interface with associated vlan</p></li></ul><p>This is my config files:</p><p>/etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

Tagged CPU port for both, disabled port1 (off) for eth1.1, for eth1.2 I tagged port1 and disabled (off) the remaining ports.</p></li><li><p>eth1.2 is associated with wan2 interface, and naturally eth1.1 is being used for lan interface.</p></li></ul><p>I will leave these notes for other staff who are having problems problems I had.
