					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using Backfire 10.3.1 on a WNDR3700 with an new external HD attached (swap partition + ext4).</p><p>Maybe I missed something in the docs or aren&#039;t understanding the obvious, but it seems that my settings in the UCI files or in LUCI aren&#039;t applied always. </p><p>I&#039;ve been struggling with Tranmission and Samba and it seemed that when I changed things, those settings just weren&#039;t always applied. I modified the /etc/config/... files and also through LUCI. <br />Now I have the same thing with mount points. When I change the mount points in LUCI and enable swap then they aren&#039;t mounted / no swap is set. I have clicked &quot;Save &amp; Apply&quot; but the mount points aren&#039;t available from the console (root). I can mount the partition and enable swap from the console however. </p><p>I tried &quot;uci commit&quot; to be sure but that didn&#039;t do anything. I also did &quot;mount -a&quot; but the mount point that was set in LUCI wasn&#039;t mounted nor was the swap space available. </p><p>When I &quot;cat /etc/config/fstab&quot; I see the new configuration. When I &quot;cat /etc/fstab&quot; then I see the old configuration! Now that is actually my question. I see the same for Samba. Changes in the /etc/config/samba aren&#039;t pushed to the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. Should this happen automatically or should I do something for this or are the conventional files in /etc/ actually ignored?</p><p>Sorry if this is a noob question but I really cannot find information about it and I really have no idea if this is correct behavior or not. </p><p>Thanks for any information.</p>									</div>
