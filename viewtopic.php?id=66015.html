					<p>Just curious how packages in releases are selected.</p><p>For example, radvd has been dropped in favour of odhcpd, however odhcpd does not have all the features of radvd (such as configurable RDNSS). </p><p>I have found several packages in previous releases which have been dropped in the current release (15.05.1 Chaos Calmer) and I am just wondering what the process for selecting/dropping a package is.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to imply that OpenWRT was EOL. It is just that I am finding I am using packages from past releases (with some success) because they are no longer included in the current release. If there was a process for pruning the packages in a release, I wanted to understand it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Never mind Max Hopper, &quot;OpenWrt is EOL&quot; is his new irritating shtick.</p><p>cvmiller, when packages moved to Git the decision was made that packages need to have a maintainer. Some packages didn&#039;t get maintainers right away, some never did at all. Barrier Breaker, as a &quot;transition&quot;, included those &quot;unmaintained&quot; packages one last time in the &quot;oldpackages&quot; directory, Chaos Calmer did not include them anymore.</p>									</div>
