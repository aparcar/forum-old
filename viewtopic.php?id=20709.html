					<p>Hi,</p><p>I work for a small London based WISP PolkaSpots Limited.</p><p>PolkaSpots has just launched a community Wi-Fi offering, which uses wifidog. We&#039;re hosting the captive portal solution on our own servers to give people the opportunity to set-up free Wi-Fi Hotspots around the world with minimum investment in hardware.</p><p>We need people around the globe to test the service for free. Places are limited to 250 for phase 1 of the trial and we&#039;ve already had loads of requests.</p><p>What you need:</p><p>1. Router capable of running the openwrt firmware. (Linksys WRT54G or similar)<br />2. An internet connection<br />3. Some customers to use it</p><p>There are no other requirements, we just want some feedback from you and your customers if possible.</p><p>Limited to 250 for obvious reasons so get a move on! We&#039;re snowed under with requests so don&#039;t be alarmed if we don&#039;t respond immediately. You can email pscwtrial@polkaspots.com for more info or to sign up.</p><br /><p>Bob</p>									</div>
