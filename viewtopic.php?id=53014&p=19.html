					<p>@savvysps<br />I was using my Western Digital 2.5 inch 1TB SATA 2 drive with a SATA to USB3.0 adapter, and my iPad 2 charger to power all of it, and didn&#039;t need to worry about disconnecting the power (the Apple charger) when the hard drive was connected.</p><p>Then when re-powering it again, it all booted up without issues.</p><p>Just make sure there&#039;s no write activity going on with the drive, before you remove the power to the HooToo and it&#039;s connected drive.</p><p>It&#039;s similar with using a USB flash drive...the HooToo powers down or up with anything connected and let&#039;s it access the drive with no issues again.</p><p>You may find you&#039;ll need a bit more current (amps of power) for the USB connected hard drive than you did if you tried a flash drive on the USB port...and if it&#039;s a 3.5 inch drive you need to attach, that works too, you just need a power adapter that will support everything you want to connect to the HooToo nano if the power will be coming from the nano USB port, to power the device.</p><p>There is a limit though, because the HooToo can only support so much current running thru it to power it from its USB port.<br />In that case you&#039;ll need to use a separate power adapter for the higher current drive you attach to it, that is connected separately to that drive, like a DVD ROM drive, ...etc.</p><p>If you plan to just power down the hard drive, and keep the HooToo nano on, the same applies.<br />Make sure no write activity is going on before powering it down...but it&#039;s all do-able.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooJunkie</strong> on 20 Oct 2015, 00:54)</p>

					<p>@savvysps @HooTooJunkie - The native Android video apps on Samsung (Video) and Toshiba (Media Player) work fine with a factory TM03 DLNA. The movies are ripped DVDs to MP4 (H.264), not HD, and I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re trying.&nbsp; As a test I had an Android phone, a tablet, a Windows phone, and a PC (VLC) streaming different movies from the TM03 at the same time without problems.&nbsp; For the iPhone I liked Infuse and VidOn players, the second was better at finding the HooToo DLNA.</p><p>@HooTooBeatMe - How is your serial connected, is it soldered? I&#039;m surprised that you&#039;re not getting any output even though you were able to get the Admin Web page to load.&nbsp; </p><p>You might have tried this already but I&#039;ll suggest it anyway: Unplug serial and power up the router to see how far it goes.&nbsp; Then plug in serial to see if you have a console.&nbsp; If you do then use the command line to reboot the router instead of power plug.&nbsp; Mine did not like powering up with the serial connected, I had to connect serial after the router had started to boot.</p><p>You can try to see if tftp is still working. The HooToo bootloader uses different IPs than what OpenWRT uses for tftp.&nbsp; The rest of the process is still the same.</p><p>ipaddr=10.10.10.128<br />serverip=10.10.10.254</p><p>Sorry to hear it might be bricked.&nbsp; Was this the router that was flaky from the start?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mmmdonuts</strong> on 20 Oct 2015, 02:36)</p>

					<p>@mmmdonuts </p><p>Thanks for that info, regarding apps on the iPad. (iOS devices)<br />I&#039;ll look at your suggested VidOn Players App on Apples AppStore.<br />I hope there&#039;s a free lite version just to see if basic .MOV HighRes movies play smoothly on my iPad, because I&#039;ve found some didn&#039;t even support that well enough, and sputtered when playing a 1280x720 .MOV movie file.</p><p>Does it also support file transfer, or is another App needed for that too.</p><p>I found many Video players didn&#039;t support file transfer, and file transfer Apps didn&#039;t support Video file playing... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I tried VLC on my iPad and it didn&#039;t work well...maybe on the Windows OS it&#039;s better.</p><p>HooToo TripMate Plus first attempt played many more file types but just had no codec support for Dolby or other fancy audio, but then HooToo even removed the ability to play the once playable video files with their updates.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>HooTooJunkie</strong> on 20 Oct 2015, 02:51)</p>

					<p>Those apps are media only, no file sharing.&nbsp; I doubt there is much out there in the all-in-one category that&#039;s any good.&nbsp; VLC is limited on mobile devices and pretty wonky on the PC.&nbsp; I use it to test things quickly when I need to.</p>									</div>

					<p>@HooTooBeatMe,<br />One more thing, can you tell if the router gets an IP on the ethernet port?&nbsp; By default the HooToo grabs a DHCP address and if yours does you should be able to telnet into the router, no ssh.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there, <br />excuse me for my english I&#039;m Italian... :S<br />I need to use this router to turn wired network to wireless via Ethernet cable. I need to connect a Mixer Audio Mackie DL806 to a router via Ethernet cable and then create a &quot;wifi network&quot; of the DL806. So I can connect my tablet to the network wifi of the mixer, and manage the mixer by tablet not physically wired to the mixer. Is it possible to do? I have asked some info to HooToo brand and he told me that this router has only WAN port. Is there a way to change a WAN port to LAN port?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you follow the process to load DD-WRT by wingspinner, and then load the CC 15.05 final release your device should have the single Ethernet port configured as a LAN side port for your mixer.&nbsp; &nbsp; You can connect your tablet to the router via wireless.&nbsp; It will be configured as a router.&nbsp; You can connect it to a LAN, but if will be isolated from that LAN, but I suspect that you want a private LAN anyway with no WAN.</p><p>Having done sound, the Mackie looks very interesting device and nice application.&nbsp; The TM02 requires a 5 volt source, but if you get the battery unit TM01 or TM04 you probably can run for an evening with no power.</p><p>There is another thread for the new units, but no functional image as yet.<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=294690#p294690">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 90#p294690</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi guys...</p><p>Here&#039;s my update...</p><p>The Hootoo TM02 is working fine generally for me... well when it works!</p><p>The thing is that it still hangs every now an then... totally random nature and often when using a app on a mobile device (have tried different apps but its the same). I think it is the flaky nature of the tripmate software more than anything else. Only option when it hangs is to manually power off and back on at the wall.</p><p>Overall the thing works fine and I have tried a number of different things using windows, ios and andriod. It also seems to read my external 2tb hard drive with no issues. </p><p>So only disappointment so far is the random hangs. Its perfectly usable otherwise and once you start streaming anything it keeps on going ok. </p><p>All this is with the .022 version of the firmware. Think I&#039;ll go back to .018 and see if things improve - I personally doubt it will!</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I know the pin reset should restore the router to the default OpenWRT image and remove the packages you installed.&nbsp; Your description of the LED pattern sounds like the router is crashing on boot and stuck in a boot-crash loop.&nbsp; If it won&#039;t boot all the way then I don&#039;t know if pin reset will even take effect, someone else might know.&nbsp; </p><p>There is a lot of information in this thread about using tftp to recover the HooToo routers.&nbsp; Read through it and decide if you&#039;re willing to try it.&nbsp; But before you do you can wait and see if others have any input on this.&nbsp; Some of these routers are getting harder to find and replace.</p>									</div>
