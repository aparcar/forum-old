					<p>Sup flyashi,</p><p>I usually ping the router IP during the reflash process (either via tftp or via the web interface) to see when it&#039;s completed, but flashing the LEDs is a good visual indicator also.&nbsp; </p><p>~Peter</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>flyashi wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Hey guys, just an idea</p><p>It takes a few minutes for the reflash to complete.</p><p>Instead of guess when it&#039;s done, why not flash the DMZ or power LED indicating that the flash is complete?
