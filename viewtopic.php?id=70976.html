					<p>The only reason to do that is if you were far away from the AP that is supplying Internet, and you need a directional antenna such as a dish on the USB radio to reach it.&nbsp; Generally it is not necessary or desirable to have two radios on the same band, you can run two interfaces on one radio.</p><p>Or if you have a router with unsupported or poorly supported radio chips, yes you can put a different one on USB.&nbsp; But you may not have all the options with a USB radio versus a good internal one.&nbsp; The bandwidth of the USB2 bus is a bottleneck.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 22 May 2017, 17:24)</p>
