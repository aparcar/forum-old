					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have recently moved from dd-wrt to openwrt and I have to say I am really pleased thus far. The only outstanding issue I have is that I&#039;m having a problem with miniupnpd flooding my sys log with the following message:</p><p>Jul 31 15:05:51 fw1 daemon.warn miniupnpd[1333]: SSDP packet sender 169.xxx.xxx.xxx:49152 not from a LAN, ignoring</p><p>This occurs pretty much every 5-6 seconds. The cause is a Directv CCK (Cinema Connection Kit) on my network and this poorly designed system actually binds a local ip (My network is a 192.xxx.xxx.xxx /24 network) and a local link address in the 169.xxx.xxx.xxx address space on the same mac address and spams upnp requests on behalf of both addresses. I cannot change this behavior without some serious PITA manual configuration on the Directv side and the router side which still could break some of the &quot;it just works&quot; magic without going into grave detail.</p><p>I don&#039;t care that the router is denying these requests that&#039;s fine. I just need a way for miniupnpd to stop spamming my syslog so its actually usable and readable.</p><p>Are there any simple solutions for this issue?</p><p>Thanks in Advance!</p>									</div>
