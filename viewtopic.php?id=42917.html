					<p>I&#039;m thinking about installing OpenWRT to my router.</p><p>Documentation keeps talking about &quot;targets&quot; here and there, but fails to explain what &quot;target&quot; is, in this context.</p><p>As a person completely untouched by embedded devices and appliances, I imagine:<br />- on one side I have a box (router) with some chips in it. Check.<br />- on the other side, there is some code base that has support for hundreds of various boxes. Check.</p><p>Now I understand that different boxes have different chips have different architectures, but architectures are the same, right? (I mean, that&#039;s what their specs are for, e.g. x86=x86...) So, could a kind soul explain to me what is the target and what is the point of having (eventually, how should I choose between) more targets for one router model?</p><p>(Frankly, I was surprised that I did not find this in FAQ. Am I the only one not getting this?)</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you can understand target as an architecture with a vendor specific solutions.</p><p>For example bcm47xx is a group of devices based on MIPS, but you can&#039;t just use some MIPS-generic build. Target bcm47xx is Broadcom specific, so it contains drivers for Broadcom specific bus, for NVRAM, for Broadcom flashes, etc.<br />There are many different MIPS based targets, for example ar7. It&#039;s Atheros specific (not Broadcom), so it won&#039;t work with the same init, drivers, etc.</p><p>Did it put a little more light on that? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>You can take a short analyze of any target to understand it a litter better. For example take a look at target/linux/brcm47xx/config-3.8. This is config for bcm47xx target which enables Broadcom specific drivers. It&#039;s completely different from ar7 (and mostly all others).<br />Apart from &quot;config&quot; target also contains patches for kernel, that have to be applied to the mainline kernel. Not all drivers have been upstreamed, so we keep some patches just in OpenWRT.</p>									</div>
