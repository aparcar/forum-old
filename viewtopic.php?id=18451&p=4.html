					<p>Hello people .... i have an inventel box, and i have compiled the firmware ... as it says danytool .... however ... my rs232 ttl doesnt work well (dunno why) and i have flashed the redboot that supports control C and flashed the openwrt.cramfs to dev/mtd1 from liventel software ....... but now doesnt works ...... and i can not connect to redboot through console .....<br />i have used wireshark to see what it says .... and when it starts ... it puts his ip through grauitous arp .... but i can not login into redboot 9000 port through network .... it isnt supported by default no? i have read in somewhere that ruff can connect to 9000 port ... if so .. i could enter and flash my router better :S</p><p>thx for all</p>									</div>

					<p>well various things ... after flashing the redboot that can be stopped with controlC the inventen can not be restored with normal firmware, because it is encripted <br />so i had to build the serial cable. now it works<br />if we turno on fconfig net_debug true, we can connect to redboot through telnet in 9000 if we have the botton one pushed. the botton one configures network for doing the load.</p><p>after i have boot the openwrt the wifi wasnt started because something in my config, i have boot with luci interface (that goes very slow dunno why) and i have been able to put wifi on.<br />Now i am fighting with brctl and wifi in modo sta, i want to bridge wifi and network but when i add eth0 or eth1 to the br0 with wifi0 ... i can not ping anything and without them yes.</p><p>Thank you for the good work people <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>hey guys,</p><p>was running kamikaze on my livebox, before i decided to mount a usb storage device. tried to install block-mount which showed errors. so decided to compile a new firmware using the new patch posted with all the mount utilites and everything. well, to cut a long story short, flashed the new kernel (checked the tftp log to confirm openwrt-livebox.bin transfer) but after the flash process i could not telnet the livebox. tried flashing again both with the newly compiled and the old&nbsp; firmware but still no response upon telnet and now to make things worse after a few attempts the redboot tftp client is not connecting to the server on my system. the log is empty. has anybody got a clue how i can recover the livebox from this failure??any help would be appreciated.thanks</p>									</div>
