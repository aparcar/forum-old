					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am looking to create a secure mesh network composed of two WRT54GL&#039;s (v1.1).&nbsp; I am unsure of how to proceed with doing this, as I am fairly new to the whole idea of a mesh cloud.&nbsp; I know how to flash my routers with the firmware and set up the basic gateway/wireless signal stuff, but after that I am pretty confused.&nbsp; </p><p>Is it even possible to set up a secure mesh network with OpenWRT Kamikaze?</p>									</div>

					<p>After checking through the links in that thread, it seems the project is intended for Atheros devices and would not work with the hardware I have (Linksys WRT54GL).&nbsp; Thanks for that link though, it would be awesome if ROBIN worked with Broadcom based hardware.</p><p>Has anyone been able to get a secure mesh network up and running w/ Kamikaze? If so, please PM me or if possible, a howto would be awesome <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks for any help guys.</p>									</div>
