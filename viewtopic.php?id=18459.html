					<p>Hello,</p><p>Anybody know of a precompiled image for either of the two routers above? Would I be correct in assuming that the &quot;openwrt-brcm47xx-squashfs.trx&quot; file in the Kamikaze 8.09 downloads will fit the WL-500W as is? I am just not sure, because the Wiki pages explain how to compile from source - but don&#039;t mention about flashing a ready-made image for these models (and which that image is) - and all other files in the downloads section for 8.09 seem to have the specific router name on them. If not - does anybody know of a different place to get a pre-compiled image.</p><p>I would like to use either of them to turn a high resolution webcam (like the Logitech QuickCam 9000 preferably) into a wireless webcam. I need a setup which uses 2.6 kernel (because of the need for uvc drivers/modules), and has preferably the &#039;motion&#039; software pre-compiled for it. I also need a firmware which is able to make the wireless work (on either router) at least in client mode. So to summarise :-) :</p><p>1. 2.6 kernel (for uvc support).<br />2. Pre-compiled &#039;motion&#039; software.<br />3. Pre-compiled image (I have compiled normal kernels for x86 and other software on my computers - if the compilation/build process is fairly straighforward - I wouldn&#039;t mind giving it a go - as long the software is mature enough not to need hacking away at code to make it work).</p><p>I know it is a sacrilege but if anybody thinks that I would be better off with some other alternative firmware for these routers for the purpose stated above - please suggest - at the risk of everlasting damnation :-).</p><p>Equally, if anybody thinks that I stand better change with another router which has:</p><p>1. USB 2.0 port/s<br />2. 4 or 8 mb or flash<br />3. Is still available to buy new<br />4. Has mature software support for purpose stated<br />5. Has wireless</p><p>please feel free to suggest.</p><p>Many thanks for any pointers or comments.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes please i also want such a router but with functioning USB-Audio driver.<br />I tried it with Asus WL-500GPv2, but the audiocard is still not working.<br />Martin</p><p>thanks for all usefull comments.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Martin,</p><p>Although not a direct reply to your post (or even my original one) - I thought I would post again here just in case it will come in handy to someone.</p><p>Since my original post, I&#039;ve investigated several options - including buying and testing two NSLU2 devices. It was all great and good - as I was aiming for very low power consumption and a compact size - but the hassle of it was too much. I wanted a device which will do everything in one - and would be relatively easy(er) to configure.</p><p>I ended up actually using one of my 4 year old HP/Compaq V2120 (I think) laptops. This laptop has a Broadcom chipset which supports hostap/master mode with Linux kernel wifi drivers.</p><p>After about 2 weeks of research and trial and error (and few more months of tweaking and tuning) - I ended up with a single machine which performs the following for me:</p><p>1. Wireless access point.<br />2. OpenVPN router<br />3. Asterisk (VoIP) server.<br />4. Small scale email server (exim + dovecot) including emailing me the voicemail messages as attachments.<br />5. WiFi sound system - using PulseAudio over network - and connected to two large speakers - thus it plays over wifi sound from my regular/work laptop - including watching films.<br />6. Firewall and router towards my Internet connection.</p><p>I have used a Sangoma U100 USB FXO card to plug it into the phone line as well - so it picks up my phone line and diverts it to my mobile (through VoIP provider) and/or takes messages and emails them to me.</p><p>I know, it is more expensive (although I already had this laptop, so not to me in the context), it is a bit more power hungry, and far faster then it needed to be. On the plus side, however:</p><p>1. It is a x86 machine, with an integrated screen - a lot easier and faster to setup, troubleshoot and maintain.<br />2. It is a x86 machine - thus I could use Slackware (or insert here your favourite distro) - which I was already familiar and (more) proficient with.<br />3. It is an x86 machine - so availability of software for Linux is better then any other architecture.<br />4. Although not as power efficient as the ARM based machine - with the lid closed (and screen off this way) it measures about 18W-20W. With the router or NSLU2 I would have had to add another external hard-drive for storage - which would have added another 5W anyway - in total 10W - plus the extra connections.<br />5. It is more repairable then the NSLU2 - I can replace and expand the external hard-disk at least.</p><p>I was (and still am to a certain extent) a big fan of the embedded platforms like the routers and NSLU&#039;s - but for the sheer speed and convenience of setup - and the fact that I have everything in one (no external hard-drive or usb memory stick, no external sound card) - well - except for the Sangoma U100 (which I would have never been able to find drivers for ARM anyway) - an x86 laptop was just the ticket for me.</p><p>It has been running now non-stop since February (almost 7 months) and quietly doing everything for me. Whenever it will break - I will replace it with one of the current netbooks - which (with the lid closed) should bring the power consumption below 10W - well within the range of an NSLU2 or router plus external hard-disk - but with far more power and convenience. Also, with a bit of luck - it might be a passively cooled netbook - with no fan to break over extended use.</p><p>The key to the whole setup is finding a machine with one of the Broadcom chips which can definitely work in host/master mode with hostap software. The kernel wifi project/pages should have further information - but it took a lot of figuring when I last looked at it to make sure you get the right chipset. At the time - the hostap software configuration took a lot of guessing - but hopefully it will be more user friendly as time passes by. There might be some other wifi chipsets which work in hostap mode - at the time I could only figure out the Broadcom one.</p><p>Also the laptop as a router/wifi access point would allow me to plug in directly a USB ADSL modem - if I ever move back to ADSL internet - which again would avoid having another device with another power supply involved&nbsp; - and would provide more control over the Internet connection directly from my server/router/multi-function-time-machine <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />.</p><p>Well - this is at least what worked for me.</p><p>Good luck,</p><p>Sebastian</p><p>P.S. - Oh - one more thing. For the purpose of turning a high-res webcam into a wifi cctv cam - I&#039;ve settled in my mind on an Asus EEE 700 series - or similar. It would have no problems working in wifi client mode, regardless of wifi chipset, it would offer 2 (or 3?) usb ports to be used for the web cam, plenty of onboard storage compared to a router (even the smallest EEE, at 4GB), and at the moment they are as low as Â£129 in UK. Close enough to a high end Asus router. But it has a screen, and it is x86, and it even has a sound card - if ever needed. And I certainly know where to get software and drivers for it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xj25vm</strong> on 18 Sep 2009, 22:49)</p>
