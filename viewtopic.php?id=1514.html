					<p>Hi,</p><p>Sometimes my router (WRT54G, OpenWRT 3.03.2) do a &quot;hard&quot; reboot (&quot;hard&quot; means that its not rebooted via command reboot. It&#039;s like switching off and on.).<br />It seems that it occurres if the router has routed an amount of traffic of ~100 MB.</p><p>First thought was that it would be a problem of power supply but it&#039;s not (tested with a little UPS).</p><p>Then i replaced the reboot command on the router with a little script which copies the syslogd output file to a place it can survive a reboot and then calls /rom/sbin/reboot.</p><p>Unfortunately no file was copied (former test has passed) so i assume this event is related to soft- or hardware.</p><p>Does anybody have an idea what&#039;s going wrong?</p><p>BTW, the router itself does not going hot while working.</p><p>thanx in advance,<br />jm</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jm</strong> on 15 May 2005, 23:33)</p>
