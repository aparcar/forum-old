					<p>Hi all together,</p><p>first of all, I tried hard to find an answer to my question in this forum and using google, but I didn&#039;t find anything. If that was because I used the wrong terms for searching, I am sorry to bother you with a new topic ;-)</p><p>I am using openWRT (Trunk) for two month now, so I am quite new to it, but I am kind of experienced with Linux (esp. Debian).&nbsp; </p><p>I am running OpenWRT BB r40576 on a TP-Link wdr3600. I installed a LAMP-stack with lighttp, php5 and MySQL and also samba for filesharing. If I start the services manually using the init.d-scripts, everything works fine.&nbsp; But when the system starts, mysqld and samba don&#039;t get started (they are enabled of course ;-)). I had the same issues with the previously installed version (also BB, but an earlier one). There I was abled to workaround with a cron job. In my current setup, cron fails saying there were parse errors. This is the crontab I am using (created as root with crontab -e):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>SHELL=/bin/ash

@reboot sleep 45 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/mysqld start
@reboot sleep 45 &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/samba start</code></pre></div><p>It gives me this in the system-log:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Thu May  1 11:39:01 2014 cron.err crond[1000]: user root: parse error at @reboot
Thu May  1 11:39:01 2014 cron.err crond[1000]: user root: parse error at sleep

Thu May  1 11:39:01 2014 cron.err crond[1000]: user root: parse error at /etc/init.d/samba</code></pre></div><p>Does anybody know help? How can I get log-infos about the init-process? I was thinking that maybe the device runs out of ram and therefore fails to start the named services, but without any logfiles it&#039;s hard to check this. If I forgot to give any information, please let me know.</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p><p>Yours, Elchi</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>thanks for your hint. That could be the issue with the cron job, although it would be weird that in an earlier version of openWRT (BB r39something) this script seemed to work. Unfortunately I do not have any syslogs from then to proove this, because I was sure it did and I did not check the syslogs back then. Anyway, I tried the workaround in the provided link and it works. Thank you very much!</p><p>But, there is still the thing with the original init.d-scripts not working as they should. I would really like to understand that, any thoughts on this?</p><p>Greetz<br />Elchi</p><p>EDIT: After hitting the send-button it appered to me, that this post could look kind of ungrateful, as I am only weeping about the stuff that is not workin ;-) Your answer solved my problem and got me get it working the way I want, so again, thank you very much!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Elchi</strong> on 1 May 2014, 17:25)</p>

					<p>in case you cant get around the problem configured services do not start,<br />you might user &quot;rc.local&quot; to place your start scripts there.</p><p>&quot;rc.local is&quot;&nbsp; called ( actually included ) at the end of the init procedure.<br />Exit with 0 if ok or 1 if init-procedure shouldnt end.</p><p>If you need a &quot;one shot&quot; use folder /etc/uci-defaults to place a script there which is executed once an deleted then</p><p>regards<br />3zl</p>									</div>
