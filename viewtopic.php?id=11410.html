					<p>Here&#039;s how I did it: I bought a USB cable with the proper voltage (TTL-232R-3V-AJ) from Mouser Electronics for ~$25US. It has a mini-stereo plug on one end. I also bought a box of mini-plug jacks from Radio Shack (&quot;3-Conductor Stereo 1/8&quot; Phone Jack&quot;) for a couple of bucks. (PN 274-249). I plugged the USB cable into mini-jack. Next, I salvaged an ancient parallel port card and desoldered a 5x2-pin header. Using a leftover CD audio cable, I connected pins 2,3, and 5 from the header to the appropriate leads on the Radio Shack mini-plug jack. Intending to install the header to the WRT350N, I tried desoldering the filled-in serial port on the WRT350N, but my soldering skills are really poor and I was worried I&#039;d damage the board. Instead, I laid the pins onto the header of the board and powered up the router. I used HyperTerminal to talk to the router. When you plug the USB cable into a Windows machine, Plug-and-Play installs a new COM port for you. Its called a USB Serial Port in Device Manager. Be sure to use that COM port with port settings of 115200 N-8-1. Occasionally, I had to push down on the pins but the cable worked great. As a bonus, I was also able to revive the WRT54G that the 350N was replacing using the same cable. I can take pictures of the cable if you promise to not laugh at my poor fabrication skills.</p>									</div>
