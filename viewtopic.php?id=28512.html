					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m setting up SNMP monitoring to monitor my OpenWRT box. But to my surprise i cannot get ifHCInOctets etc. There seems to be no support for Counter64 at all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m running Backfire (10.03, r20728) with package snmpd-static (5.4.2.1-2).</p><p>Is this a hardware limitation or should I file a bug for the snmpd-static package maintainer?</p><p>Thank you for your help,<br />Ralf.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well.... thank you, but what I meant was a more complete howto. You know, like in the<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/templates">http://wiki.openwrt.org/meta/templates</a></p><p>Most (new) users probably have one PC with some GNU/Linux distribution on it, if any. A router with OpenWrt would be their first &quot;second device&quot; which runs 24/7. I would never run a PC 24/7 just for fun. It wastes energy (and money). My OpenWrt-Router (and my new Dockstar ;-)) are my very first devices I run 24/7.</p><p>So there is no experience with snmp, because until now there was no possibility or reason for such. The same is true for a dhcpd, a timeserver, DNS-stuff, webserver, etc.<br />It would be already helpful to provide one or two links to an already existing HowTo. I mean, even if you read the related wikipedia article, I often do bother to link to it, you don&#039;t gain much knowledge, as most articles are, IMHO, shit. You don&#039;t get a good understanding, and you still need a howto anyway. There should already be a dozen good howtos, I just don&#039;t find them using google. And why waste time searching?</p><p>But well, if you see no point in writing a howto,&nbsp; there is no point in bothering with it. I didn&#039;t mean to recruit you, I just thought to mention the wiki. There is one, it is active, and I suggested some articles to be written. Contributors welcome.</p>									</div>

					<p>Orca, I understand. But I just edited the Wiki to link to this thread. If I find the time to patch and build my own solution I&#039;ll update the wiki with a Howto. Still, I hope duvi can copy-paste some of his knowledge so I don&#039;t have to reinvent the wheel. My time is not in abundance a.t.mâ€¦</p>									</div>
