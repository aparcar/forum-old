					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I recently bought a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND as i read somewhere that it could be used as a torrent downloader by installing transmission on it.<br />I have installed OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 on the router fine, but know im confused. The web interface seems really hard to use compared to normal routers, but i guess its designed for the hackers not noobs like me <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I have read in the HOW TO section that you can make the router a repeater but you need to change some configuration files to make this happen. How do you access the files i tried using winscp as someone suggested that elsewhere but all the passwords and usernames i tried gave me access denied.</p><p>Also with the repeater does the main modem sending the initial wireless have to be also running OpenWRT or is it ok running its own firmware (the modem is a Netcomm NB12WD)?</p><p>Is it possible to build a OpenWRT firmware package with both transmission and the Repeater mode built in or do you need to do it after installing the initial package.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>wood</p>									</div>

					<p>If you find LuCI hard to use you may give Gargoyle a shot, it&#039;s based on OpenWrt but aims to provide an interface similar to that of commercial routers.

					<p>You&#039;re welcome.

					<p>Hmm, I successfully operated transmission on my WR1043ND. Worked fine for me for about 3 months. 24/7.</p><p>The only problem I saw and still see, is the disk usage. You have merely 32MiB of RAM and can use a certain amount of it for disk buffer. So the disk is constantly being written to or read from. My harddisc is still ok (old Samsung 160GiB with 7200rpm I put into a USB-Disk-Thingy) but I didn&#039;t want to break it and also, it consumes quite some current. The harddisc gets very warm as well.</p><p>As long as electrical current isn&#039;t an issue, a lot of things are possible and fun.</p><p>If you try to work aroung this issue, you option become limited very fast.
