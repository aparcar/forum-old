					<p>Also, Chad, it appears the latest 1.04 Prerelease using the Luci trunk is missing the &quot;IPv6 RA and DHCPv6 tab&quot; from Luci, whereas the previous 1.01 build had it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think this is related to my issue but doesn&#039;t make it any easier to diagnose.</p><p>I have installed dhcp6-client and it doesn&#039;t seem to make a difference.</p><p>It would be helpful to have the tcpdump package available (and libpcap) so that packet dumps are available for debugging.</p>									</div>

Try the below to manually switch to the alternate firmware image:<br /><a href="https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wiki/Manually-switch-to-previous-firmware">https://github.com/Chadster766/McWRT/wi … s-firmware</a></p><p>For users that don&#039;t have the USB to TTL cable its best if you always flash OpenWRT from the Linksys firmware. This way you always have the Linksys stock firmware in the alternate image. It&#039;s and extra step but some assurance that you can recover from a lockup in the firmware.</p>									</div>
