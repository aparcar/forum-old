					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I am quite new to OpenWRT and networking in general actually, so I hope I can get some help here. I want to test throughput of a link with only one way traffic. Ideally, station 1 will send data, and station 2 will only receive data without any kind of acknowledgement. </p><p>1) I&#039;m thinking I need to setup an Ad-Hoc multicasting network. Does that sound right?</p><p>To start, I want to setup an Ad-Hoc network between two computers. Unfortunately, I&#039;m having trouble. The systems use the ath9k driver and a recent version of OpenWRT. I initially tried setting up the ad-hoc network using Luci, but I couldn&#039;t get the two computers two connect. In the Luci web interface, PC2 showed up as an associated station to PC1, but PC1 did not show up as an associated station to PC2. After that I tried the following commands:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iw wlan0 set type ibss
ip link set wlan0 up
iw wlan0 ibss join adhocTest 2437</code></pre></div><p>At that point, the two PCs appear to be associated with each other, and a random BSSID was generated. I also added ap_scan=2 to the wireless config. However, I tried checking the connection using iperf as I usually do in AP/Client mode, and the connection timed out. So either I&#039;m not testing this correctly, or I haven&#039;t got the network setup correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p><br /><p>thanks,<br />Aaron</p><p>etc/config/wireless looks like this for both devices:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;
