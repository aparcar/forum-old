					<p>From TableofHardware, F5D7230-4 pre1444 is supported and 8230-4 v1 is untested. Now 8230 is more popular in the market than 7230. Anyone got a chance to test it?<br />Recently, I flashed 8230-4 v1 firmware with Linksys wrt54gx v1&#039;s v1.02.06 firmware. They are mostly hardware identical. Does it mean 8230-4 v1 is partially supported by openwrt as wrt54gx v1?</p>									</div>
