					<p>The command dmesg gives you the boot log (from the kernel). If it was long since you booted what you are looking for might not be there anymore.</p><p>There is also the logread command.</p><p>The command ifconfig lists your network devices. Among other things MAC address is shown. If network is not available/set up this might fail to give you the answer.</p><p>Both the boot log and the MAC addresses can also easily be found in the Web Gui (Luci).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zo0ok</strong> on 6 Aug 2015, 10:05)</p>

					<p>Hi!</p><p>If you would like to get remotely last boot log of your device, I suggest you next bash script, which you can run in cron on your main server (not on openwrt device). In this case you will be able to get your log remotelly automatically.<br />#!/usr/local/bin/expect<br />eval spawn ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oCheckHostIP=no root@&lt;ip-of-your-openwrt&gt; -p 110<br />#use correct prompt<br />set prompt &quot;password:|coffee|Saving config files&quot;<br />interact -o -nobuffer -re $prompt return<br />send &quot;&lt;your-root-pass-for-openwrt&gt;\r&quot;<br />interact -o -nobuffer -re $prompt return<br />send &quot;dmesg &gt; /tmp/last_boot\r&quot;<br />interact -o -nobuffer -re $prompt return<br />#And now transfer the file over<br />set timeout 1<br />spawn scp -P 110 root@&lt;ip-of-your-openwrt&gt;:/tmp/last_boot /&lt;somewhere-on-your-main-server&gt;/.<br />expect yes/no { send yes\r ; exp_continue }<br />expect password: { send &lt;your-root-pass-for-openwrt&gt;\r }<br />expect 100%<br />sleep 1<br />exit</p>									</div>
