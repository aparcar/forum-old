					<p>Unplug and replug the wifi dongle then check dmesg (status -- kernel log) you should see &quot;New high-speed USB device&quot; at the bottom.&nbsp; This means the basic USB system is working on your VMl, the kernel connects to the device but doesn&#039;t know how to drive it.&nbsp; Thus you need to install the driver for your chip.&nbsp; Usually this is rt2800.</p><p>The next milestone is to use the iw list command.&nbsp; If it shows a bunch of info about your device, the driver is working.&nbsp; Then you just need to use LUCI to set up a wifi AP.</p>									</div>

					<p>Determine which chip is in your device.&nbsp; The two four digit &quot;vendor&quot; and &quot;device&quot; hex numbers are unique to the chip type.&nbsp; Go to wireless dot kernel dot org and find the driver that matches.&nbsp; Then look in the kmod section of openwrt package list and install driver.</p><p>Drivers for nearly all chips are already in the mainstream kernel.&nbsp; Compiling one from the manufacturer is unnecessary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 20 Dec 2016, 01:00)</p>
