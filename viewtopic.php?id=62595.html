					<p>Hello!</p><p>Can OpenWrt be configured as a publicly-accessible Wifi network that forces browsers to log in and accept my Terms of Agreement before browsing the Internet?</p><p>I&#039;m looking to do something exactly like what coffee shops and hotels use (like Starbucks). When someone first connects to their open/public wifi, it opens a browser, gives a welcome message with terms of use, and may prompt them to enter a password to gain access. It also restricts access during off-hours, and logs someone off after a couple hours.</p><p>Can OpenWrt be set up like this?&nbsp; Is there a howto guide on setting this up?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
