					<p>thanks for the reply<br />i used the x-wrt web interface to configure it i didnt mess with config files<br />i didnt set an IP for syslog server and i am using no WAN connection or WAN IP (openwrt is not the LANs router or gateway)...i just wanted to use the internal kernel syslog messages not remote logging</p><p>i just chose file but i also tried the &quot;circular&quot; option which doesn&#039;t ask for filename<br />of syslog file and i set 64 kB for size </p><br /><p>the &#039;+&#039; sign is because i copy - pasted i dont know what it means...its the error message i get in transmission when i click the &quot;log&quot; option on the cgi (it was supposed to draw a graph of download and upload speeds by parsing the syslog file and using gnuplot</p><p>the file syslog.log is -rw------- <br />i tried chmod 755 to it but nothing changed...i also noticed a syslog.log.0 file automatically created with similar content (syslog mesages)</p><p>it was working fine on dd-wrt again configuring syslog with the web-interface<br />it is an issue of optware packages and openwrt and it has to do with the syslog daemon</p>									</div>
