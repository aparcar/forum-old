					<p>i am facing the problem that after the connection is established, i can ping another VPN peer from my router (WRT54GS) but i can not ping another VPN peer (VPN 10.0.0.1)&nbsp; from any of machines behind the router, as well as another VPN peer can not ping my router (VPN 10.0.0.2) where openvpn is running.<br />i disabled firewall for one second and then another VPN peer could ping my router but none of my internal machines could ping another VPN peer (10.0.0.1). pinging 10.0.0.2 is OK.</p><p>configuration:</p><p>another peer&#039;s openvpn.conf:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>port 5678

					<p>No, I don&#039;t know your setup (this was the first time you mentioned masquerading, e.g.).</p><p>Yes, masquerading is defined in the &quot;nat&quot; table (-t nat) as it is a form of network address translation; as it is further a form of &quot;source natting&quot;, it should be placed in the postrouting chain.</p><p>The FORWARD chain is not in the &quot;nat&quot; table, though. Depending on your default policy, you have to &quot;-j ACCEPT&quot; the packets you&#039;re willing to forward to the tun interface.</p><p>If you want to access &quot;only&quot; the 10./8 network, a simple network route should be fine. If you want to route ALL traffic through tun, don&#039;t forget to set a host route to the neighbouring vpn server.</p>									</div>
