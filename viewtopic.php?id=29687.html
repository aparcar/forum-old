					<p>Hi all,</p><p>In my network config i use 8 vlans with each an IP address of a different subnet assigned to the corresponding network bridge.<br />I want to use a Windows DHCP server which resides on my main LAN subnet (vlan 1) to assign IP addresses for all subnets in my 8 vlans, using different scopes off course.<br />I don&#039;t want to use the DHCP server of OpenWrt to assign IP adresses so i want to use a DHCP Relay in OpenWrt to forward DHCP requests to my main Windows DHCP server.</p><p>In the software section there is a package DHCP-Relay (ISC&#039;s DHCP relay) which i can install but i don&#039;t know to configure it and i can&#039;t find anything related in this forum.<br />Does anyone know how to configure a DHCP Relay in OpenWrt?</p><p>I have a Netgear WNDR3700v1 and i use the newest Arokh version firmware of OpenWrt.</p><p>Thanks a lot,<br />Eric</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey eric111,</p><p>I know it has been a while since you posted, but I&#039;m sure that the answer can be helpful to others to.</p><p>The package you must install is the &quot;dhcrelay&quot;. The man page is <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/dhcrelay">here</a>.</p><p>I will give my configuration as an example.</p><p>I have an client (Ubuntu), a AP (dhcp relay agent) and a dchp server.</p><p><span style="color: red">Client(eht0)</span>-----------<span style="color: blue">(eth1)AP(eth0)</span>-----------<span style="color: red">(eth0)Server</span></p><p>The server has the IP 192.168.2.102 and the AP 192.168.2.101 on the same subnet. The client and the AP do not have IP on the subnet connecting they.</p><p>So, the command is very simple.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dhcrelay -i eth1 -a 192.168.2.102</code></pre></div><p>This will make the AP to listen his eth1 interface for a DHCP request and forward it to the server (192.168.2.102). Also note the option <em>&quot;-a&quot;</em>. I put it there because I needed the dhcp option 82 to be appended in the request.</p><p>Hope it helps.</p><p>Best regards</p>									</div>
