					<p>Just a small sunbeam from the dark north. </p><p>We have used OpenWRT as a base for making a WiMAX Base Station â€“ successfully. The BS is based on an Alix-board from PCengines, running x86 Kamikaze with a â€œRT-tweaked kernelâ€ . Currently we are running live tests in Norway with multiple CPEâ€™s connected. Next is to make a CPE â€“ also running OpenWRT.</p><p>Huge thanks to everybody for making the OpenWRT a reality â€“ Iâ€™ll make sure we contribute/donate back!</p><p>TTrondsen<br />WITELCOM AS<br />Norway</p>									</div>

					<p>@ttrondsen<br />Congrats !<br />Would be interested testing this here as well, to replace WiFi based long distance links (7-9 km). We get two 8 Mbps adsl subscriptions simultaniously through those but that is about the max. <br />The Asus Wl-500gp unit also has an mPCI slot. Would that be an option in combination with the Wavesat card ? We are looking here for low cost / high performance solutions and preferably it should work in the 5 GHz ISM band.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi there friends from the north!&nbsp; i too work with WiMax hardware, however we have moved from BS-SS setup to a mesh setup (also at 4.6 and 5.8Ghz).&nbsp; Just curious, what version of quam 64 are you using?&nbsp; have you set up multiple subscribers?&nbsp; cool to talk to someone else in the field!</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt;doddel</p><p>I&#039;m sure the Asus may work for the CPE mPCI, but the BS mPCI definitely not - it needs a whopping 8-9 W or more on the mPCI bus. Not many boards provide that.

We&#039;ve deployed multiple SS - adding more every week. We definitely would be interested to talk with others - drop me an e-mail, will you?</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt;ttrondsen<br />thanks for the info; am a bit puzzled about this BS vs CPE power issue as the Wavetek website states that the DM256 chip can do BS and CPE role, just as the Broadcom chips we are used to in WiFi. Given the 17dBm output power it cannot be the RF causing the trouble. Where do the extra 5 Watts go ?<br />Hope you&#039;ll contribute an OpenWrt package that adds to OpenWrt whatever it takes to control the BS and CPE WiMAX interface.<br />When coming to Portugal drop me a line !</p>									</div>

					<p>The DM256 is really &quot;steam-engine&quot; technology - very conservative yield with corresponding power consumption in combination with typically 100% duty-cycle for the BS. All this equals a lot of power and high temperature. The DM256 mPCI may run both BS and SS, but is way to expensive for the latter usage. The NP7256 is cheaper, but SS-mode only.</p>									</div>
