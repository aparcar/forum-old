					<p>Hi, </p><p>I managed to lock me out of the router by setting the LAN (eth0) to dhcp. Now the router is not accessible via default IP. The reset button appears to have no functionality (pressed it for about 10 sec) . How can I regain access to the router? It does not matter if all settings are lost.</p><p>UPDATE:<br />I&#039;ve connected the router to my other router which assigned an IP to it via DHCP. I changed the LAN status back to static and set the IP to 192.168.2.1, but now I can&#039;t reach the router via this IP...</p><br /><p>SOLVED:<br />I repeatedly pushed the reset button in quick succession after unpluggin and then plugging the router. The &quot;SYS&quot; LED flashed in quick succession and I was able to telnet the router at 192.168.1.1 using a static IP (e.g. 192.168.1.2) via cable!</p><p>From here I could do a reset <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I think this should be added to the wiki! </p><br /><p>Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>l1n00x</strong> on 22 Sep 2010, 19:59)</p>

How to assign from DHCP to static from another router? I have the same wr841N like you, and my first router modem is from ATT universe 2Wire.
