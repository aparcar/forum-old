					<p>I have the following issue with using a tunnelled ssh connection to launch a VPN on a very recent CC install:</p><p>- on boot, autossh runs to make a tunnel to a remote server [working]<br />- I can log in to the router via the tunnel [working]<br />- launch OpenVPN [working]<br />- have autossh reconnect to the remote server via the VPN [not working]<br />- exit the VPN [not working]<br />- have the tunnel brought back up via wan&nbsp; [not working]</p><p>This means that once I start the VPN I am locked out of my router.</p><p>It seems that the existing ssh/autossh processes aren&#039;t killed properly on openvpn start, meaning the port is held on the remote server. By trial and error I found that the following sequence of commands (issued on a local test system) issued one after an other achieves what I want:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/autossh stop   [kills the existing ssh sessions to the remote server]
/etc/init.d/openvpn start
/etc/init.d/autossh start   [starts a new instance of ssh and connects to the remote server]
#use the VPN connection as normal.
#when done
/etc/init.d/autossh stop
/etc/init.d/openvpn stop
/etc/init.d/autossh start </code></pre></div><p>How can I put all this in a script so I can issue, e.g., &#039;/etc/init.d/customVPN start&#039; remotely to bring up the VPN and be able to log back in via the &#039;new&#039; ssh tunnel?</p><p>And then, when done with the VPN, issue &#039;/etc/init.d/customVPN stop&#039; to bring back up a tunnel over WAN?</p><p>I&#039;ve tried issuing &#039;/etc/init.d/openvpn start&#039; using openVPN&#039;s &#039;up&#039; parameter, but that seems to be too early in the sequence. There is no pre-up parameter to allow &#039;/etc/init.d/openvpn stop&#039;. However, there is pre-down to issue &#039;/etc/init.d/openvpn stop&#039; before openVPN stops.</p><p>Would hotplug.d scripts work? It seems there is an autossh script already that is meant to run when an interface is brought up, but that doesn&#039;t seem to be working...</p><p>All help / ideas greatly appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I will promptly use double NAT over double encryption If I was you. </p><p>To solve the issue,You could use a more basic VPN like pptp since encryption is not problem (ssh is already encrypted). you could also host the vpn on the other side and use your router as the client.</p>									</div>

					<p>Not sure I follow or maybe it isn&#039;t possible. To be clear, I only use the reverse tunnel for ssh access as there is no public IP available and I am physically remote.

(1) is stable enough (power cycle to fix usually). With (2) you&#039;d be relying on the VPN always working; using a 3rd party service is proving to be hit and miss with dropped connections at peak times etc.</p><p>So, to have (1) always available to fall back to if (2) goes down would be advantageous.</p><p>I can set this up successfully by issuing the commands in the OP from the LAN-side. I can&#039;t do it remotely as the connection would drop as vpn0 comes up and takes over. Hence the need for a script to do it via init.d or hotpug.d, or a combination of the two.</p>									</div>

					<p>So the process is:</p><p>1) Router boots and autossh creates tunnel to remote server<br />2) I connect to this tunnel to manage the router<br />3) I want to be able to issue a command (/etc/init.d/vpn start) to start a VPN client connection (to StongVPN) to avoid doubleNAT on the LAN-connected clients. The command needs to be issued by ssh&#039;ing in to the router from the server - using the tunnel.<br />3a) Before the VPN is initiated, autossh needs closed cleanly to release the port(s) used on the server.<br />4) When the VPN is up, I can access the router via the public IP of the VPN server.<br />5) I&#039;d ALSO like to have autossh run when the VPN is up to connect to the server as in (1) and the router be reachable via that route, so autossh needs to run after the VPN is up.<br />6) When the VPN is stopped, autossh needs to stop cleanly first, then the VPN goes down, then autossh needs to start again using the normal routing / gateway.</p><p>To achieve this, I have used 4 scripts (A to D) inspired by <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=105621#p105621">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 21#p105621</a> Next to them I have indicated the order they are run in.</p><p>A init.d/vpn<br />- to kill any existing autossh instances (1)<br />- to run /etc/init.d/openvpn start (2)<br />- to kill the VPN autossh instance (4)<br />- to run /etc/init.d/openvpn stop (5)</p><p>B hotplug.d/iface/60-vpnscript<br />- to run /etc/init.d/autossh start&nbsp; on ifup (3) and ifdown (6) of the VPN interface vpn0</p><p>C /etc/openvpn/autossh-up.sh (3)<br />D /etc/openvpn/autossh-down.sh (6)<br />- scripts run from openvpn on Up / Down to initiate the hotplug.d</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ cat /etc/init.d/vpn
