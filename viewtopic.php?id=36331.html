					<p>Ok Thanks to everyone I got this finally working!</p><p>1. You need to install raccon (what a surprise) described <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.basics">here</a> under Packages.<br />2. You need to change <strong>/etc/config/racoon</strong> accordning draner86 (Thank you!) with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option &#039;enabled&#039; &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Now I got a problem with <strong>remote.tld</strong> is this a file and if so do i have to create/change this manually or what?</p><p>So I changed:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  option &#039;remote&#039; &#039;REMOTEDNSNAME&#039;                # see fritzbox vpn *.cfg  fqdn = REMOTEDNSNAME
  option &#039;pre_shared_key&#039; &#039;PASSWORD&#039;    # see fritzbox vpn *.cfg key = PASSWORD
  option &#039;my_identifier&#039; &#039;NAME&#039;                  # see fritzbox vpn *.cfg name = NAME</code></pre></div><p>3. For REMOTEDNSNAME resolving to IP you need /etc/init.d/racoon script that also starts the service. Maybe I use this script wrongly but I also need to change the line:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>remote=`nslookup &quot;$remote&quot; | awk &#039;NR==5 { print $3 }&#039;`</code></pre></div><p>to<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>remote=`nslookup &quot;$remote&quot; | awk &#039;NR==3 { print $3 }&#039;`</code></pre></div><p>4. Finally i started </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/racoon start</code></pre></div><p>script returened no errors but I also got no connection, because the firewall rules were missing.<br />5. So according&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.ipsec.firewall">here</a> I created a zone vpn (careful! case-sensitive, like everything else in linux) and I started <strong>/etc/racoon/firewall.sh</strong> manually.</p><p>I like to hear some advices...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>QFireball</strong> on 11 Jul 2012, 00:02)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>1) maybe you should give extra attention to proposal settings. The racoon control script in the wiki uses obey mode. Here some info about that.</p><p>The proposal check setting can be defined as obey, strict, claim or exact. If obey is used, a responder will always use the initiators lifetime value. If strict is used, a responder will use the initiators lifetime value if it is shorter than the responders. A responder will reject the proposal if the initiators value is greater than the responders. If claim is used, a responder will use the initiators lifetime value if it is shorter than the responders. A responder will use its own value if it is shorter than the initiators. In the second case, the responder will send a responder lifetime notification to the initiator when responding to a phase 2 proposal. If exact is used, a responder will reject the proposal if the initiators value is not equal to the responders.</p><p>2) if parameter above does not help you should give a switch to main mode on both sides a try.</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>

					<p>To understand the connection problems:</p><p>Client -&gt; Openwrt -&gt; VPN -&gt; Fritzbox -&gt; Server</p><p>You cannot reach some of the servers through the tunnel. If this is right you should first of all check that openwrt does not drop packets. If you use the firewall script from the wiki, you can add a logging rule to the zone_lan_forward chain (lan or whatever you call your openwrt inside network). Insert this rule just above the zone_vpn_reject rule. In my example at position 5:</p><p>iptables -I zone_lan_forward 5 -j LOG</p><p>This results in:</p><p>rule target <br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_ACCEPT<br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_ACCEPT<br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_ACCEPT<br />4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_ACCEPT<br />5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LOG<br />6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zone_vpn_REJECT</p><p>Afterwards have a look at the syslog (logread -f) while you try to connect to the remote server. If you catch any log output (verify VPN target IP adresses) you are missing some rules.</p><p>Best regards.</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>thank you for this tutorial, i&#039;ve got my VPN tunnel working, but I still have some problems. I can connect to my remote Fritzbox, but only when i stop the firewall process via SSH. When I do this, i don&#039;t have any Internetconnection on my TP-Link router, but I can connect to my remote Fritzbox. When the firewall is startet, I have my normal Internetconnection but I can&#039;t access to my remote Fritzbox (Firefox says no connection). I think something is wrong in my Firewallsettings. Can somebody post his Firewallsettings (maybe QFireball)? That would be great. Or maybe someone can explaine me step by step what I have to configure. I&#039;am trying since days now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> Sorry that is my first openwrt Router and I&#039;am not so good in Linux.</p><p>Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Hisense</strong> on 29 Dec 2012, 04:34)</p>
