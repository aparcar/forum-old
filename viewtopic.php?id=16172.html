					<p>The OpenWrt project will over the next two months focus on a new Kamikaze release. The official name is to be: OpenWrt Kamikaze 8.08 Release. The planned schedule will take the following shape:</p><p>*Last day in July - final release candidate: 8.08 RC-1. This will be a feature freeze, and all changes after this point will be bug fixes.</p><p>*Last day in August - final release: OpenWrt Kamikaze 8.08 Release.</p><p>OpenWrt Kamikaze 8.08 Release will, amongst other, focus on bringing the following features:</p><p>- Firewall rewrite<br/>- Broadcom 47xx running reliably with the new Kernel, not including wifi<br/>- IMQ and Traffic shaping tested with newer kernels, especially 2.6.25<br/>- Sysupgrade for more platforms (x86 is tested again)<br/>- The new web interface (LuCI, Lua Configuration Interface)<br/>- Full support for new platforms and targets<br/>- Attention towards the integration of security updates<br/>- Package maintaining and updates between releases</p><p>The OpenWrt Team</p>									</div>

But so far all I have gotten in response to my question is an insult, and do it yourself. Not very helpful.</p></blockquote></div><p>I fear you have greatly misunderstood both my post and the very nature of openwrt development (and before you launch into a defensive tirade, I&#039;m not saying that to offend you - I&#039;m saying it because it&#039;s important that you do understand. Once you have understood, you will realize that no-one is _ignoring_ anything).</p><p>Openwrt is (in my opinion) like any other distribution. Like debian, like fedora, like any of those listed on distrowatch. Their purpose is to accumulate individual packages into a coherent whole, which then becomes meaningful to end users such as ourselves. Their purpose is most definitely NOT to develop one of those individual packages. Oh, and by the way, I am already aware that the distinction between the two (distribution vs. package development) is NOT a well-defined line. It is, instead, a blurred grey-area. However, my point still stands, and that is that openwrt is primarily a distribution. Therefore, the people who develop openwrt _must_ limit the amount of time they spend on upstream development - if they don&#039;t, their distribution (openwrt) _will_ suffer.</p><p>Now let&#039;s look at the other side. Where does openwrt get its packages from? Well, from upstream devs of course. And where&#039;s the best place to find out about upsteam dev for the linux 2.6 wireless susbsytem? In the case of the broadcom drivers (and many others, come to that), it&#039;s the linux wireless mailing list available at linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org. If you would like to search their archives (and follow, and research, all of the bits of it that don&#039;t make sense at first), it shouldn&#039;t take you more than about 45 hours to realize that no-one in upstream dev-land has a &quot;released, stable, working linux 2.6 mac80211 / nl80211 / bcm43xx / bcm ap-mode software stack&quot; (I&#039;ve quoted 45 hours since that&#039;s about the amount of time that I&#039;ve spent looking in the last week, and I suspect that it would take us approximately the same amount to time to do the same job).</p><p>So, to recap, upstream (for linux wireless) doesn&#039;t have a &quot;released, stable, working linux 2.6 mac80211 / nl80211 / bcm43xx / bcm ap-mode software stack&quot; _despite_ the fact that it&#039;s all they do (that&#039;s their specialist subject) _and_ there&#039;s a load of them doing it. I personally conclude, therefore, that it&#039;s _difficult_. Not that they (upstream) are &quot;ignoring&quot; anything.</p><p>Back to the openwrt devs. The openwrt devs can see that upstream haven&#039;t yet produced something that works well enough for the upstream devs to use. So what should they (the openwrt devs) do? Drop their distribution and become linux-wireless devs instead? Of course not. They (the openwrt devs) might be able to help upstream out with a patch or two, but they (the openwrt devs) are developing a distribution, _not_ the wireless susbsystem/drivers. The openwrt devs have got a whole load of other questions to worry about (such as firmware flashing, boot loaders, which package manager to use, etc, etc, etc, the list goes on). If the openwrt devs have in any way suggested that your best chance for working wireless is to get an atheros card, it&#039;s no more than a pragmatic reflection of the current state of upstream development.</p><p>If I am to explain myself fully, I myself found your original post (&quot;Will this continue to be ignored&quot;) to be highly offensive. And no, I&#039;m not just saying that as some form of retaliation. I&#039;m saying that because for me, it implies some form of &quot;not caring&quot;, which I believe could not be _further_ from the truth. The simple fact of the matter is that with such an incredibly broad subject as computers, people _must_ specialize in order to achieve anything - the openwrt people have chosen to specialize on their distribution, while the linux-wireless people have chosen to specialize on wireless subsystem/infrastructure design and development. There are not enough resources in a single lifetime to do both. In fact, it&#039;s even stronger than that. There aren&#039;t enough resources in several people&#039;s lives to make the wireless subsystem work properly (yet).</p><p>If I have offended you, I will apologize. However I&#039;m still confused. You still haven&#039;t told me who (openwrt or upstream) is ignoring something. However, this is my last post on the subject. I&#039;ve already spent too much of my time trying to explain how &quot;nothing is being ignored&quot; rather than fixing bugs / implementing missing bits of functionality in open source sofware. That, is irony.</p><p>Jaime</p>									</div>

					<p>BatGnat: Perhaps there&#039;s a bit of a miscommunication, but your comment seemed to me to be quite insulting to the OpenWrt developers, and not just &quot;a simple question.&quot;&nbsp; In fact your comment seems to me to be more offensive than jaime&#039;s reply to you.</p><p>The way I see it (and perhaps I&#039;m wrong) is that Broadcom has been very unhelpful wrt. allowing/helping people to write open drivers for their hardware.&nbsp; Despite this, people are working on the problem and I am sure a future version of OpenWrt using a 2.6 kernel will work well with this hardware.&nbsp; The reason people say you should get an Atheros card is probably one of the following:&nbsp; Atheros is much more open to free and open drivers and have even hired an Open Source Atheros driver developer.&nbsp; Atheros hardware is better supported and so if you want a stable wireless platform NOW, then Atheros is probably a better choice than Broadcom.</p><p>If this post has offended anybody, I did not intend it to.</p>									</div>
