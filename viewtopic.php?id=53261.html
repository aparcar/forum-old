					<p>Hi,</p><p>I can&#039;t make sense of the WAN port speeds of two WNDR3800 routers, one with BB 14.07, the other with original firmware 1.0.0.48.</p><p>I have connected the WAN port (eth1) of the Barrier Breaker WNDR3800&nbsp; to one of the LAN ports of a FRITZ!Box 7390. Both ports are supposed to be gigabit ports. But the color of the WAN port&#039;s LED (orange) and ethertool tell me its fast ethernet connection only:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Settings for eth1:

        Link detected: yes</code></pre></div><p>If I use the second WNDR3800 (with the original firmware) in the same spot, its WAN port LED is green for a gigabit link.</p><p>If I then connect the WAN port of the Barrier Breaker WNDR3800 to one of the LAN ports of the second WNDR3800, that LAN port&#039;s LED is green (gigabit) while the WAN port&#039;s LED stays orange (fast ethernet). But ethertool now reports a gigabit link:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Settings for eth1:
        ...

       ...</code></pre></div><p>It seems, the color of WAN port&#039;s LED does not properly reflect the port&#039;s speed in Barrier Breaker. Is that something I can configure?</p><p>What might be the reason I don&#039;t get a gigabit connection to the FRITZ!Box with Barrier Breaker as I do with the Netgear firmware?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Malte</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t think that the WNDR#700/WNDR3800 wan LED changes color according to the wan connection speed in Openwrt. To my knowledge, we can control the color in LED options in Luci (or in /etc/config/system). We can basically toggle between green and yellow.</p><p>I wrote in 2012 a hotplug script to change the color, but haven&#039;t really used it:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=153850#p153850">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 50#p153850</a></p><p>The script monitors &#039;ifup&#039; actions from &#039;wan&#039; interface, then queries the link speed and sets the wan LED to green if speed=1000, otherwise to yellow.</p><p>Place this into a new file named&nbsp; /etc/hotplug.d/iface/99-wanspeed and it should work:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if [ &quot;$ACTION&quot; = ifup ]; then
        if [ &quot;$INTERFACE&quot; = &quot;wan&quot; ] ; then
                SPEED=$(cat /sys/class/net/eth1/speed)
                if [ &quot;$SPEED&quot; = &quot;1000&quot; ] ; then
                        logger &quot;ifup $INTERFACE, speed $SPEED: set wan LED to green&quot;
                        echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /sys/class/leds/netgear\:green\:wan/brightness
                else
                        logger &quot;ifup $INTERFACE, speed $SPEED: set wan LED to yellow&quot;
                        echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /sys/class/leds/netgear\:green\:wan/brightness
                fi
        fi
fi</code></pre></div><p>I briefly tested that in my WNDR3800 and wan LED changes to green.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Mar 2016, 16:21)</p>

					<p>There is some kind of negotiation problem on mine.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t even get a WAN address until I run the ethtool command to force 100Mpbs on the WAN port.&nbsp; &nbsp; The modems&#039;s internet light also stays out until the ethtool command gets run, then it lights up yellow for 100Mps.&nbsp; &nbsp;(It supports gigabit, but something on the WNDR3800 doesn&#039;t allow it to connect full speed)</p>									</div>
