					<p>I managed to brick my wdr3600 v1.5 that I got from samknows, when trying to flash it.Now, When I turn it on, all lights blink every 2 secs. <br />I tried this method : <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=269129&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0/"> post 4 </a> but it takes almost 1 hour to finish transfer and tftpd32 loses connection at about 20%.I tried with &quot;wdr3600v1_en_3_13_31_up(130320).bin&quot; file, that doesn&#039;t have a &quot;boot&quot; part.<br />I&#039;m on windows 7 and I disabled my wifi connection and firewall before doing this.<br />Is there any way to unbrick this nice router that I&#039;ve never used(because of samknows firmware)?Thanks in advance for your help and sorry for my english!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hara75gr</strong> on 20 Jul 2015, 11:31)</p>
