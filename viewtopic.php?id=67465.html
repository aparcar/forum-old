					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have a weird issue with a debricked TP-Link WR841ND V8.0. It now only boot when a USB to UART (cp2102) Controller is connected to the serial port (based on my tests only GND and TX are needed). So it looks like it <br />somehow need the 3,3 V from the USB to UART Controller.</p><p>When starting with connected Controller it boot up and runs fine but as soon as I power off and power on again <br />(without the USB to UART Controller connected) only the power LED is on and I do not see anything on putty.</p><p>Probably I have broken the board during my first tests with a USB to Serial Controller (should have read more<br />before starting with debricking the device).</p><p>Anyone know if and how this can be fixed or should I just throw it away?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the Info&#039;s Mijzelf!</p><p>As I did not have a resistor to test what you have suggested I tried some other things<br />and found out that if I shorten TX and VCC (of the serial ports) the device is also starting.</p><p>Can that break the board if I leave it this way or is this generally not recommended as <br />now TX permanently has 3,3 Volt from VCC?</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>Mijzelf wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I think you somehow connected the TX to another trace, which now injects noise.

					<p>For TX that is not a problem. The port has a high impedance, and so you can safely connect it to ground or VCC. But I don&#039;t know about that unknown noise generator. You have connected that to 3.3V also.</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t know to be honest what you mean with &quot;noise generator&quot;. Before TX and GND was connected to the USB to UART Controler. Now I just shorten TX and VCC. So it seem that TX need 3,3 V (whyever).</p><p>Currently the device is up and running based on my first checks (WLAN, LAN, DHCP, Routing, etc..) but the System LED is permanently going ON and OFF which due to documentation mean that there is a system error but I don&#039;t know what the error is.. probably because I have shorten TX and VCC..</p><p>If you think it is not dangerous to have TX and VCC shorten I will leave it now how it is and see how long it will work.</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Mijzelf wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>For TX that is not a problem.
