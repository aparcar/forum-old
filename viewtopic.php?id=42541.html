					<p>I am running OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1&nbsp; on a Netgear WNDR3700 v 1.</p><p>I have:<br />kmod-ipt-nat<br />kmod-ipt-nathelper<br />kmod-ipt-nathelper-extra</p><p>all running on the box.<br />I am trying to set up a PBX (PBX In A Flash) behind the router and allow external (remote) extensions to register.</p><p>The PBX is supposed to run an iptables modifier which opens ports based on a dyndns check (on the PBX, not the router); if my uncle&#039;s phone in CA is sitting at X.Y.Z.A and is has a dyndns address of unclesphone.dyndns.org, the the PBX should open its firewall to requests from X.Y.Z.A.</p><p>On my cellphone phone (not attached to the local network/all wifi turned off), I can run a dyndns update and check with <a href="http://www.whatismyip">www.whatismyip.com</a> and &#039;know&#039; that the IP address of the phone is 166.137.X.Y; when I register the cellphone to the PBX and the ports are forwarded from the OpenWRT device the PBX sees the requests as coming from 166.137.Z.L (i.e. a different IP address).</p><p>The .X.Y address is current and can be checked via update.</p><p>So, why is the router passing/why would the incoming be seen as .Z.L?</p><p>Clearly if I unblock the dyn address and the incoming to the PBX is seen as another IP it gets dropped like a hot potato.</p><p>I can only see that the wrong IP address is registering by clearing the iptables and allowing anything.</p><p>Is there something I can set up and check on the router to see if .Z.L is incoming or if .X.Y?&nbsp; In other words, is my network somehow mangling an IP address (yet allowing me to make a call) or is the router somehow mangling it all on its (incorrect) own?</p><br /><p>Andrew</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndyInNYC</strong> on 25 Feb 2013, 22:57)</p>
