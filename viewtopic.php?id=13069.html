					<p>Hello, <br />I&#039;m having trouble getting bluetooth to work on the WR 0.9 release, specifically the firmware posted here: <br />OpenWRT Firmware for WRT54G3G- New Aug. 25th: <a href="http://www.evdoforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=6621&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">http://www.evdoforums.com/viewtopic.php â€¦ mp;start=0</a><br />It&#039;s an awesome package overall but I need help getting BT running.&nbsp; </p><p>General, overview type help would be appreciated - with a point and a push in the right direction I&#039;ll do all the digging and experimenting. </p><p>DETAILS.<br />Router is a WRTSL54GS. EVDO Connection works thru the USB as follows: <br />&nbsp; * Novatel U720 USB dongle<br />&nbsp; * Tethered Sanyo M1 phone through USB cable (&quot;phone as modem&quot; service active).<br />&nbsp; * Both work directly connected, or via powered USB hub.<br />&nbsp; * Hotplug does not work 100%, if I unplug/re-plug the phone it I can&#039;t get it to dial up even with &quot;ifup - ifdown&quot;</p><p>What I&#039;d like to do is connect to the phone to the router via bluetooth (incoming calls ring through only when using the EVDO in BT). Bluetooth **worked** once, but not all the way and very unreliably. I got to the point where the phone could see the router, and vice versa, but they could not connect. </p><p>BT works much better with the Kamikaze 7.09, 2.6 kernel, but then I lose WiFi and I have to re-implement all the dial-up EVDO stuff in this firmware.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />~Matt</p>									</div>
