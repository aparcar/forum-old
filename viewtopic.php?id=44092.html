					<p>hi all<br />I need to set up two or more bidges that must have the same MAC address (the one of the wlan0 device).<br />While it was quite easy in r318xx (just a patch in /lib/network/config.sh) I&#039;m having problems in 12.09 trying to config these bridges and assign them all the same MAC address.<br /> I could re-configure bridges (ifconfig &lt;bridge&gt; hw ether) as soon as they are up, but does not seem like a good idea: unfortunatelly I can not find where the bridges are created so to edit that lines to match my needs.<br />Someone can help me?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
