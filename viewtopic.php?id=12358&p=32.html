					<p>Well, I&#039;m sorry to say that, but I do not agree... I&#039;ve thrown my wrt350n away 2 months ago because I was just fed up with the wifi instabilities (even with a nightly reboot).<br />With&nbsp; just 1 client connected it was almost ok, but as soon as I got a second one connected, then it usually started to be a nightmare (very frequent client deconnections). And with a 3rd one it was almost non usuable.<br />So I ended up buying a Netgear WNR3500L to replace it and I can now enjoy rock solid wifi connections.</p>									</div>
