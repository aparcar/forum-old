					<p>I&#039;ve compared the changes in the newly released V3 code to the V2.2 code, and it seems that the V3 hardware is basically the same.</p><p>There are apparently, two new LED&#039;s (One white, and one Orange colored) that can be controlled, SES_LED1, and SES_LED2. It also appears that there might be an additional button on the V3 hardware, related to the SES_LED&#039;s. Pushing the button appears to send some info via UDP, to the last HTTP client, so I&#039;m guessing this might be part of their new &quot;autoconfiguration/diagnostics&quot; stuff.</p><br /><br /><p>Also, they&#039;ve fixed the ping.asp/traceroute.asp bugs this time.</p><p>Other than that, it appears as if the hardware is pretty much the same as the V2.2&#039;s. There&#039;s no mention of any architecture specific changes to the device.</p><p><em>Here&#039;s a link to the diff: <a href="http://rodent.za.net/files/v3changes">http://rodent.za.net/files/v3changes</a></em></p>									</div>

					<p>Vsop<br />Did you set boot_wait on your version 3? Or did you just push openwrt onto it through the web and hope?<br />Is there a version of linksys firmware for version 3 that doesn&#039;t have the ping.asp bug patched?&nbsp; Or if I want to use version 3 am I basically stuck soldering on a serial port?</p>									</div>
