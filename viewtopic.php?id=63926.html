					<p>Greetings fellow OpenWRT users, I have recently acquired the linksys e8350 router to later notice the lack of a port to this platform. The SoC used in this router is the exact same one as in the D-Link DIR-885L A1, which is already supported by openwrt (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/d-link/d-link_dir-885l_a1">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/d-l … ir-885l_a1</a>). According to this table <a href="http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/router-soc-101,review-33464.html">http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/router-so … 33464.html</a>, a few more routers (ASRock G10, Compex AP148, Linksys EA8500, Netgear D7800, 7500, R7500v2, and TP-Link Archer C2600 v1.x) could also benefit from this port.<br />If anyone else has this router and would be interested in helping port OpenWRT to this router, respond back!</p>									</div>

					<p>Note that the Broadcom WiFi hardware is problematic, even on &quot;supported&quot; devices with that SoC (and others).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eas</strong> on 4 Apr 2016, 10:58)</p>
