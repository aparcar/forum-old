					<p>So, we got a new shipment of RB411s in and I attempted to install OpenWRT on one of the new boxes.&nbsp; Right away I ran into some issues.&nbsp; The Ethernet driver is not being loaded properly.&nbsp; It looks like the physical mapping has changed.</p><p>On one of the older boxes, everything boots fine and the Ethernet driver loads fine:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# dmesg | grep eth0
eth0: Atheros AG71xx at 0xb9000000, irq 4
eth0: connected to PHY at 0:00 [uid=00221512, driver=Generic PHY]
eth0: link up (100Mbps/Full duplex)</code></pre></div><p>On one of the new boxes, I ran into issues:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:/# dmesg | grep eth0
eth0: Atheros AG71xx at 0xb9000000, irq 4
eth0: no PHY found with phy_mask=00000001</code></pre></div><p>The main difference I see is the Ethernet chip has changed from a KSZ8041NL to a AR8012.&nbsp; The layout on the board is moved around as well.&nbsp; There are now mount points for SD, USB, and PCI-E.</p><p>I know I need to change the phy_mask in trunk/build_dir/linux-ar71xx/linux-2.6.30.10/arch/mips/ar71xx/mach-rb-4xx.c.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I have no idea what to change it to.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried guessing few different addresses, but I&#039;ve had no luck.&nbsp; The most up-to-date setting is listed below:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>static void __init rb411_setup(void)
{
        rb4xx_generic_setup();
        rb4xx_add_device_spi();

        ar71xx_add_device_mdio(0xfffffffe);

        ar71xx_eth0_data.phy_if_mode = PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_MII;
        ar71xx_eth0_data.phy_mask = 0x00000001;

        ar71xx_add_device_eth(0);

        ar71xx_pci_init(ARRAY_SIZE(rb4xx_pci_irqs), rb4xx_pci_irqs);
}

MIPS_MACHINE(AR71XX_MACH_RB_411, &quot;MikroTik RouterBOARD 411/A/AH&quot;, rb411_setup);</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;m at a lost on how to resolve this issue.&nbsp; If I knew what address to set ar71xx_eth0_data.phy_mask = 0x00000001 to, I&#039;m sure I could get this fixed.&nbsp; Has anyone else ran into this issue?&nbsp; Does anyone have the spec sheet for the newer RB411 boards?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>swolfe</strong> on 4 Dec 2009, 21:18)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m thinking about switching to the RB411R for an openwrt project I&#039;m working on and have a couple questions about the above fix.&nbsp; I&#039;m coming off a stubbornly clinging to the 54gl, so I&#039;m a little rusty on how to hack this stuff for unusual platroms:</p><p>1. With this fix will openwrt work without modification on the Mikrotik RB411R? (the one with the built in radio).&nbsp; In that vein, is the wiki page (http://oldwiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs%282f%29Hardware%282f%29Mikrotik%282f%29RB433.html&nbsp; &lt;-- this is for the 433, but I assume it&#039;s the same procedure.&nbsp; there&#039;s no wiki page for the 411) current?<br />2. Have the changes above been integrated into one of the builds on the DL site (link?).&nbsp; I&#039;d love to avoid building images if possible...</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>WTGPhoben</strong> on 8 Jan 2010, 23:37)</p>

					<p>Kamikaze doesn&#039;t work on the RB4xx boards.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to compile from the latest trunk.&nbsp; As far as if it will work on the RB411R, I am not sure.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have one to test.&nbsp; But it is an Atheros radio, so it should work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>Have you send the patch to the OpenWRT trunk?
