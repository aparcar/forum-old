					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>So i have managed to get my router functioning quite well as USBIP device with a few thumb drives - I can access them via wireless and it makes me really happy. </p><p>The thing making me sad is that when i tried transmitting something slightly less trivial, like a usb mouse, the router never boots correctly - the LED continually flashes and the wireless network never appears for me to connect to. </p><p>any ideas why this might be? i feel it might be something to do with power, since the usbs that dont work tend to be the ones with funky lights in them. I&#039;m gonna try and find an externally powered usb hub and plug that into the router, then plug my devices into that. does this sound like it might fix it? i feel like i might have to do some weird hacks to get it to work with a usb hub, so if i can avoid that it would be good.</p><p>any other ideas would be very welcome.</p><p>cheers</p>									</div>
