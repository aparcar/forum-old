					<p>I managed to install LEDE on my V5 using alexvan&#039;s factory image and the lede sysupgrade image method.</p><p>The switch works perfectly. VLAN tagging works and I know it&#039;s very case specific but PPPoE auth for my ISP works too (once you figure out the correct configuration, see hxxps://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=71191)</p><p>Wireless is all over the place. If you change the mode, channel, width or transmit power from either 2.4ghz or 5ghz they crash and won&#039;t enable themselves. Encryption works though, I&#039;m currently using WPA2-PSK with forced AES and it works.</p><p>He doesn&#039;t like low signal too. I&#039;m either hitting 30-40 Mbps on my wifi devices or they straight up drop and reconnect. My phone is struggling with this a lot more than my laptop (which has an Intel 7260 AC adapter). They meant it when they wrote &quot;Radios do not work reliably yet&quot;.</p><p>Overall I&#039;m happy, next step is to get the official install image and better wifi support, then I&#039;ll probably fiddle with VoIP and SIP, which will probably be quite tricky.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mickeyes</strong> on 10 Jun 2017, 20:01)</p>

					<p>Yes! Second time trying the lede-17.img it worked. Dont know what went wrong the first time. Installed Lede-17.01.1 using the ...squashfs-sysupgrade.bin from alexvanbelles repository and then upgraded to lede-17.01.2 using the firmware posted on the lede downloads page. Wifi works fine on both radios getting 35- 45mb/sek download and 29-32 upload on speedtest. Next step now is to configure an OpenVpn client for HMA (HideMyAss).</p>									</div>

					<p>I flashed two routers with LEDE and now I test their performance and capabilities. However, there are controlable just 2 of the 5 LEDs on the front panel (<strong>wndr3700v5:green:power</strong> and <strong>wndr3700v5:green:wps</strong>). I can control the remaining 3 by GPIO by sending 0s and 1s to GPIOs 13, 15 and 16 (e.g. <em>echo 0 &gt;/sys/class/gpio/gpio13/value</em>)</p><p>Is there any way to add them to <em>/sys/devices/platform/gpio-leds/leds</em>?</p>									</div>

					<p>Another issue:<br />MAC addresses of the external eth port seem to be randomly generated. I did not experience such behavior on any other LEDE / OpenWRT device. Overriding the MAC in GUI is quite tricky and CLI is not much better. As I need to power the devices regulary, it is really inconvenient.<br />Any idea how to prevent that?</p>									</div>
