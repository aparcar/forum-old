					<p>I have both of these routers, since they don&#039;t support IPv6 ,wanted to update one of them with OpenWRT to do some some IPv6 tests with the ISP modem/router before maybe buying a Asus RT-N66U or AC</p><br /><p>All update attempts have been made going to administration panel of the router and selecting the firmware file followed by pressing update firmware. All fails result in the router rebooting and working afterwards as intended.<br />All attempts have been made by connecting laptop over a ethernet cable to port1.</p><p>What I have done so far:</p><p><strong>WRT320N</strong><br />1-Tryed to update WRT320N to openwrt-15.05-brcm47xx-mips74k-linksys-wrt320n-v1-squashfs.bin<br />2-Fails around 8x-9x%, router reboots<br />3-Factory reset done in administration panel.<br />4-u<strong>pdating it to FW_WRT320N_1.0.05.002_20110331.bin from Linksys - successfully firmware update</strong><br />5-Tryed again openwrt-15.05-brcm47xx-mips74k-linksys-wrt320n-v1-squashfs.bin<br />6-fails around same % , router reboots<br />7-tryed to update with openwrt-15.05.1-brcm47xx-mips74k-linksys-wrt320n-v1-squashfs.bin<br />8-result : fails around 8x-9x% router reboots</p><br /><p><strong>E2000</strong><br />1-Tryed to update E2000 to openwrt-15.05.1-brcm47xx-mips74k-linksys-e2000-v1-squashfs.bin<br />2-Fails around 8x-9x% , router rebooted<br />3-<strong>Firmware update to FW_E2000_1.0.06.001_US_20140310_code.bin from Linksys - successfully firmware update</strong><br />4-tryed again&nbsp; to update openwrt-15.05.1-brcm47xx-mips74k-linksys-e2000-v1-squashfs.bin<br />5-Fails around 8x-90% , router reboots</p><p>Is there anything i can do to figure what is going wrong ? I see the E2000 wiki page mention only 14.7 as latest supported but I did found a 15.0.5.1 file for it in the download list?</p><p>Regards Ward.</p><p>UPDATE : or should i be using 14.xxx?<br /><strong><br />UPDATE: 14.07 seams to work on the E2000</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>meep</strong> on 5 Jun 2016, 16:27)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve just started looking at OpenWRT today with an E2000. I&#039;ve not taken the plunge yet but I&#039;m a bit reluctant to put version 14 on as it&#039;s dated 2014.</p><p>In the notes (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e2000">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e2000</a>) it says that most browsers get to 80-90% and then fail, although Internet Explorer 11 succeeds. Have you tried IE11?</p><p>Let me know if you can get v15 working as I&#039;ll probably have a go tomorrow myself.</p>									</div>
