					<p>I&#039;m looking for advice on buying a good OpenWRT-compatible router. I looked at the Table of Hardware and filtered a little based on what I think I&#039;ll want, but I have other more subjective/speculative questions that table can&#039;t help me with as much.</p><p>I bought my current router before I even knew about OpenWRT, but was happy to find it is supported. However, it doesn&#039;t transfer files at full speed to function as a simple NAS (at least not since the last time I tinkered with it) and it&#039;s missing modern hardware features. It doesn&#039;t have 5Ghz, VLAN, or guest SSID support. I&#039;d like to separate house guests&#039; traffic from my home network with a guest SSID. Possibly run OpenVPN for remote access.</p><p>So I&#039;m curious if there are any stand out recommendations for a router that has really solid OpenWRT support for those features on its chipset and it looks like it will be supported for a while by a larger group of OpenWRT users, similar to how flagship Android smartphones receive a little more long-lasting developer support / community attention. I know there are no guarantees, but I thought this was the best place to ask for information that could help me make the best decision.</p><p>Thanks for reading <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>techgique</strong> on 30 Aug 2017, 00:05)</p>

					<p>ISP speed is 60Mbps/5Mbps currently. Intending to switch providers to get 100Mbps soon though. Not a deal breaker to get 100% of that speed over wireless or be gigabit ready. I don&#039;t expect I&#039;ll be paying the premium for gigabit anytime soon. More concerned about reliable speed for NAS use really.</p><p>I&#039;m all about Linux and keeping as much as possible running on open source software, so I&#039;ll definitely be using an ext4 file system. I usually like to use full disk encryption with ext4+LUKS. Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s possible or not and to get hardware accelerated encryption (AES-NI) on top of it. I always use LVM2 nowadays too. I&#039;m really out of the loop on what kind of power top of the line routers have these days though. If that&#039;s unreasonable, I might just set up an old tower or something like a NUC or some other lower power device with CentOS for the NAS.</p>									</div>

					<p>You should state what your current router is and clarify that you are or not on OpenWrt (You imply you are)</p><p>I am of the opinion that if you want a NAS, buy a NAS.&nbsp; My experience is that USB on these devices is a fraction of what a real device will do.&nbsp; I do have USB drives set up on two of my routers, but use them sparingly for small files (Not GB video files for sure).</p><p>Do not confuse your internet speeds with what you can have for LAN speed (File transfer in house).&nbsp; You should still get a GB router and switches.</p><p>You will need to go to X86 or better boxes to get AES-NI, though some higher end models may also offer this.&nbsp; You do want this for OpenVPN.&nbsp; Understand and use the algorithms supported in the hardware.</p><p>If you are running OpenWrt you should be able to have a guest LAN on the device. It&#039;s configurable in OpenWrt even if the original vendor firmware did not support this.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry if it wasn&#039;t clear. I am running OpenWRT now. My current router is the Asus RT-N16, which uses the Broadcom BCM47xx SoC.</p><p>I wouldn&#039;t be using a NAS for large media file streaming either. I would just like a central storage and backup device for my documents and sharing photos etc across my home network more easily.</p><p>Thanks, I understand that LAN speed is the concern for file transfers between devices etc. I think I tried using sshfs with my current router a while ago and the speeds were unusable in my opinion. I&#039;ll probably use Samba instead in the future. I&#039;d also like a USB 3 port in case I use the new router for these purposes.</p><p>So one can have separate LANs on the same SSID? So they&#039;d still have the same SSID password but the networks are isolated by the router?</p><p>Those x86 appliances don&#039;t regularly have multiple gigabit ethernet ports though do they? Sounds like I might want one for the NAS, but I&#039;d like to figure out a solid router option first.</p>									</div>

					<p>If by <em>x86 appliance</em> you mean the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802007522/up-squared-the-first-maker-board-with-intel-apollo">UPÂ²</a> linked, that is simply a general purpose computer with a couple of NICs(albiet Realtek). Use it for whatever you want, desktop or router or... If you need a router with WIFI, stuff the M.2/PCIe/USB with a a LEDE/OpenWrt supported device. More than enough horsepower to route and perform other <em>secondary</em> tasks(NAS); although I prefer separating such things onto other HW.</p><p>Edit: Another option for WIFI would be to use your current router as an AP, and something like this as the router+.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Villeneuve</strong> on 30 Aug 2017, 22:32)</p>
