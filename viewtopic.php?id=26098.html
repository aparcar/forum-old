					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have tried to build myself custom image for TP-Link WR841ND as described in <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/imagebuilder">wiki</a>.</p><p>While building I didn&#039;t do much, used the default configuration, just with ppp and ppp-mod-pppoe packages removed:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>make image PROFILE=TLWR841NDV5 PACKAGES=&quot;-ppp -ppp-mod-pppoe&quot;</code></pre></div><p>After building was done, I picked up image file </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>bin/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-tl-wr841nd-v5-squashfs-factory.bin</code></pre></div><p>and flashed the router via web interface. Everything went fine, but after the reboot - router is not responding anymore... I can clearly see that it boots up by blinking leds. Also when I plug the cable between PC and router - LAN1 (or any other too) LED gives light as well - but that is all... I cannot even ping or telnet to the router - always getting &quot;Request timeout&quot;... </p><p>Tried accessing by old IP address and by default - 192.168.1.1&nbsp; Also tried hard reset as described in documentation (holding reset plug for 15 seconds) - to be sure that router has default 192.168.1.1 IP address - but still with no luck...</p><p>Can it be that by building custom image I&#039;ve missed some important package/lib, which was needed by router for network to run properly?</p><p>Is there a chance to flash the router again with &quot;stock&quot; OpenWRT image?</p><p>Thanks in advance!<br />Laimoncijus</p>									</div>
