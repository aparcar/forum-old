					<p>Dear All, <br />I am doing my research on 802.11s and I am quite new to this subject therefore I need some information from you. I shall be very thankful to you if you could provide me some feedback on b/m questions. <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Could you please tell me that what is the difference between 802.11s and Batman-adv (as far as I know both of them are layer 2 protocols)?<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; In future I will try to build a small lab setup to test the functionality of wireless mesh network therefore I would also like to know that which chipset will be best for my use (May be I shall do some modification in the source code). <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, I shall be very thankful to you if you share the initial installation steps of setting up Mesh Network using both 802.11s and Batman adv.</p>									</div>
