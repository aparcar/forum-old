					<p>Hi all:</p><p>I recently reflashed 2 TP-Link routers with DD-WRT.&nbsp; I got them working, but it was kind of a hassle.&nbsp; And it got me to thinking, can&#039;t this be made easier?&nbsp; </p><p>Why not design a router from the ground up to work with OpenWRT and sell it here?&nbsp; The money generated could be put into further dev and drive down the cost of future OpenWRT made routers.&nbsp; Sort of like Mozilla did with FireFox.</p><p>Is this a crazy idea?&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks for any feedback.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>letsmakeanopenwrtrouter</strong> on 17 Feb 2013, 09:34)</p>

					<p>I have flashed openwrt on two tp-link routers (MR-3420 and WDR-4300), and I think it has been pretty straight forward. What problems have you seen.</p>									</div>
