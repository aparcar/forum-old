					<p>I recently flashed OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1-RC5 on my WNDR3700v2 and I have to say I am very happy with this setup.<br />However, I noticed that once i rebooted the router, each time I log into the web interface (LuCI), the default page -- &quot;Overview&quot; tab under &quot;Status&quot; no longer auto-refreshes every 5-6 seconds like it used to pre-reboot.</p><p>I wasn&#039;t sure what caused this. I thought my asterisk setup potentially broke something else, so I reflashed openwrt, saw the LuCI Overview page refresh before the first reboot, and not afterwards.</p><p>Is this a general LuCI bug or is it just my WNDR3700v2 that is acting strange.</p><p>If its a generic bug, is anyone aware of a fix?</p><p>Appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,<br />chhatc</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chhatc</strong> on 11 Aug 2011, 06:12)</p>

					<p>Actually, the previous auto-refresh sounds like a bug situation to me. I have no recollection that the Overview screen in my WNDR3700 would refresh automatically every few seconds. Neither in Backfire nor in trunk versions.</p>									</div>

Which I think makes a bit of sense because the page constantly showed me a changing overview of things such as a change in signal strength of my wireless connection if I moved from one room to another (farther away).</p><p>If you think this is a bug, can someone enlighten me as to the behavior of the Overview page in Trunk OpenWrt for their routers. I&#039;m just curious to see if its just Backfire or also trunk as well.</p><p>Thanks,<br />chhatc</p>									</div>

And I don&#039;t mean &quot;never finishes loading&quot;. The page has to successfully render and the browser shouldn&#039;t be stuck on &quot;the waiting&quot; phase. </p><p>Maybe the confusing portion of &quot;auto-refresh&quot; is being missed completely. The page doesn&#039;t itself send a refresh-request as one would do so by hitting F5 (Windows and *Nix). I mean the individual components within the page modularly refresh their contents (similar to using callbacks in desktop apps).</p><p>If someone&#039;s seen Tomato&#039;s interface, they should know what I mean, the page&#039;s content refreshes automatically every 3-4 seconds (except in tomato this is literally written at the bottom of each page, LuCI it doesnt say so).</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>thanks,<br />chhatc</p>									</div>
