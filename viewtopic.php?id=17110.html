					<p>I want to be able to block the traffic from a specific host on the network (&quot;turn off the internet access&quot;)</p><p>Before I had the rule that worked:<br />iptables -A input_rule -s 192.168.1.206 -j REJECT</p><p>The following doesn&#039;t seem to work (in /etc/config/firewall):</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dest wan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto tcp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option src_ip 192.168.1.100 (the ip of the computer in question)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option target REJECT</p><p>It doesn&#039;t block this ip from getting onto the internet. I also tried by mac, and opt src lan (instead of dest wan), and with quotes - doesn&#039;t make any difference</p><p>PS. I know that I asked this question a few weeks ago. I suspect, that the subject was somewhat unrelated, therefore I am reposting with a better one, rather than bumping the old one.</p><p>TIA</p>									</div>
