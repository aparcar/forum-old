					<p>That&#039;s correct -- The packages aren&#039;t out there.... Yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;The next build will include the missing packages. I usually update about once every two weeks, but I see there&#039;s been a BQL patch issues for mvneta, so I&#039;m going to try and push the timetable up.</p>									</div>

For instance retrieving the package list from your site will now give an attacker the version information of the firmware. And I&#039;d imagine they could eventually cause an overflow by preemptively sending a spoofed package list response. With TLS they just see the domain accessed and not the specific site URLs. <br />Reading LWN has made me more paranoid I guess.</p>									</div>

					<p>Currently in the process of compiling new builds which will include all packages that can compile cleanly.</p><p>I had updated SNMP from 5.4.4 to 5.7.3, but had to roll back.

Though snmp isn&#039;t one of the more popular packages, snmpv3 should have been working for a few years now. I really don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to get it going, but plan to start working on it over the next 3 days, and over some of Christmas vacation.</p>									</div>
