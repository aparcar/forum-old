					<p>Would someone be so kind and share a checksum (sha256, or md5 works for me too) for kaloz&#039; &quot;Mildly Customized Chaos Calmer [CC] Build <em>(Released October 13, 2016) Based on kernel version 3.18.36</em>&quot; image? There is sadly no checksum listed for this image on the wiki page. I just want to make sure that I don&#039;t try to flash a potentially broken file. Thanks!</p><br /><p>Follow-up Question: It looks like the kaloz image is the only image for my shiny new WRT1200AC v2. I don&#039;t really care for WiFi atm., would the standard stable image for &quot;V1 (caiman)&quot; do the job too?

					<p>Hi gents,</p><p>my 1900ACS (v2) baby just arrived today. Was a little bit disappointed in the beginning with the 5ghz signal strength -&gt;&nbsp; I am using a H960 pro plus android tv box, tried to get more mb/s via 5ghz compared to my old router (TP-Link Archer C2 AC750 stock firmware). But well, 5ghz just does not get through walls, right? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Anyway, I am still sitting with the original firmware, and it`s a pitty to keep a WRT device... with other then an opensource firmware. I know that 1900ACS is supported out of the box with openWRT (chaos) but I read here that it`s best to jump to Kaloz (better/new wi-fi drivers) and this is what I am gonna do.</p><p>My question is, can I/should I expect better wi-fi bandwith (5ghz) and signal with the OpenWRT? Of course, there ain`t no magic, right? Also ... when I flash it, it will be flashed on the 2nd partition of my router right? So when I just want to go back to OEM, just flash OEM back from Kaloz and then reload my settings for OEM.</p><p>I read also about Kong (DD-WRT) release, but I guess ... this is no better then Kaloz, so I am going ahead and flashing Kaloz guys. Hope will get better wi-fi too.</p>									</div>

					<p>velqn,</p><p>the closed source and open source driver perform roughly the same from what I read. All open source firmwares use the same driver. The question is just whether the driver is recent enough or not.</p><p>You can go back to OEM as you described. The configuration should have been preserved as Linksys uses the &quot;syscfg&quot; partition for that purpose. OpenWrt doesn&#039;t use that partition at all. Still always better to have a backup around.</p>									</div>

					<p>So far I&#039;m quite happy with my new WRT1200AC v2. It is rock stable so far and after I flashed it I didn&#039;t even rebooted it once since then (just restarted some services as necessary.) </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@sapphire:~# uptime
 19:01:16 up 3 days, 23:49,  load average: 0.02, 0.02, 0.04</code></pre></div><p>There&#039;s still a bunch of smaller issues to solve, of course. I got a whole to-do list. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; Most of the annoying ones seem to be related to IPv6, e.g. the internal NTP time server only seems to listen/serve IPv6 and all my IPv4-only systems can&#039;t make use of it. Also ssh&#039;ing to the router has some huge connection delay during the DNS resolving stage (either I must use the IP or specify &#039;AddressFamily inet&#039; for the host in my ~/.ssh/config to workaround this). Some of those issues are probably aggravated by my spectacular lack of knowledge about anything IPv6 related and the way OS X handles it. I&#039;ll get there some day, hopefully. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>Anyway...<br />just a short question. At the moment I run the device w/o the antennas attached, since I don&#039;t need wireless networking for now. Can this cause any kind of problems (extra interference or something) since there are now just those connector stumbles at the back of the device? Not that there seems to be a lot of shielding in this device anyway.</p>									</div>

I wanted to test the reboot/ shutdown procedure anyway to see if some potential problems would pop up, so there was a chance to attach those ugly and space-wasting antennas. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><br /><p>This was a good idea since I spotted a small issue after the restart. The interface for DSL modem access was back up, even it was intended to stay disabled by default. Seems just disabling wasn&#039;t enough, but that &quot;bring up on boot&quot; option had to be enabled too. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I also noticed that the initial time update is somewhat slow in my case (rather long delay of about 1 minute until the time was properly set). I guess the WRT1200AC doesn&#039;t sport a hardware clock either and OpenWRT reads the initial time from some last-modification timestamp on disk (initial time was off by only 16.85 hours)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello</p><p>I am thinking about buying Linksys WRT1900ACS v2<br />1. Does WiFi 2.4G and 5G works with OpenWrt?<br />2. Does all ETH ports work with full bandwidth?<br />3. Which open firmware should I flash CC, DD, LEDE, Kaloz, something different?</p>									</div>

					<p>lukaszdh,</p><p>1. CC has a too old wireless driver, not really usable with any devices of the series. Kaloz images work well for wifi and otherwise, the main issue is they don&#039;t have an own package repo, so no additional kernel modules than what comes with the image. Other packages from CC can be used just fine. LEDE has the newest driver but some report worse performance with that one, like lower coverage and sporadic drops.</p><p>2. The hardware is easily capable if gigabit Ethernet (NAT at 20% cpu load) but needs a 4.10 kernel or backports. 4.12 is the first to fully support WRT1900ACS (v1 &amp; v2) without extra patches. Without all backports you only get about 750Mbit. DD &amp;&amp; McDebian &amp;&amp; LEDE should be fine.</p><p>3. LEDE tends to break sysupgrade, so unless familiar with the console not a good idea.</p><p>My order of preference:<br />custom DD (works very well for me on the ACS) &gt;&gt; DD &gt; Gargoyle &gt; Kaloz &gt; McDebian &gt; DD-WRT &gt;&gt; LEDE &gt; CC</p>									</div>
