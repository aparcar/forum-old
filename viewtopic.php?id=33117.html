					<p>I want to change the boot loader on tplink 3220 that uses uboot. <br />I am trying to change the defauls serverip from 192.168.1.27 to the server on my LAN.<br />Also is it possible to make the default boot from tftp instead of from memory?</p><p>I can connect via serial and use setenv but there is no saveenv command available. Even if i set the uboot partition to not be read-only how would I save the changes?</p><p>-thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>i suggest you download the source codes on TP&#039;s GPL site, as far as i knowe your uboot doesn&#039;t support the saveenv cmd.<br />so you&#039;d better compile your owen one,<br />1,find the proper board relate h file in /include/config/yourborad.h&nbsp; &nbsp; (usually you can find your board name in the series printout messages like ap99 ap93 or db121 etc.)<br />2,find the config cmd micro it looks like #define CFG_COMMAND .... can&#039;t remember the exact name ,and add CFG_CMD_ENV<br />3,add #defien ENV_IS_IN_FLASH 1 ,and #undef ENV_IS_NOWHERE, #define ENV_ADDR&nbsp; &nbsp;the addr you wanna save at, #define ENV_LEN 0x10000 sooorry can&#039;t remember either but looks like these, and you can find them in the .h file<br />and run make youboard_config; make<br />then you will get a u-boot.bin file .but be careful about the file size if it&#039;s &lt;128kB you should append FFFFFFF upto 128kB(no more no less) using a winhex or some other tool,also edit the MAC addr at offset 0x1fc00.</p><p>caution !!!!! your wrt may bricked</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tthrx</strong> on 28 Nov 2011, 14:29)</p>

					<p>That is a little to risky for me I think. I tried to cat the mtd0 to a file and edit it in a hex editor but I am not able to write it back to mtd0 because it is locked. I tried unlocking it following the wiki instructions at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr1043nd#making.bootloader.partition.writable">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- â€¦ n.writable</a> but it did not help me. I created a post about it at <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33170">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=33170</a>&nbsp; but I am still stuck.<br />I don&#039;t reall want to brick this router but I do want to change some env settings and maybe even get it to tftp boot instead of booting from memory.</p><p>Just in case I try the (might) brick route this post: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=149061">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=149061</a> is basically what I need to do right? Just change the moodifications but the filling up to 128 is the same idea.<br />Also if its &gt;128 then I am stuck?</p><p>-thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>firesam</strong> on 28 Nov 2011, 16:33)</p>
