					<p>I had OpenWRT on my WRT1900AC&nbsp; router and wanted to flash back to the Linksys stock firmware before re-flashing OpenWRT. I downloaded the .img file onto my PC beforehand and made sure I was using a cable connection. I browsed for the file through LuCI and clicked the flash button. The router rebooted as the fans span up and I tested access to 192.168.1.1 and nothing worked. I opened up putty and behold it OpenWRT was loaded up. Can someone help me sort this out as now I have no internet please.</p><p>Will</p>									</div>
