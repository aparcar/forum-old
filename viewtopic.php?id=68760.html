					<p>Hi there, </p><p>I&#039;m currently exploring the options to implement a private network using openwrt based routers. </p><p>System requirements are as follows,<br />1) 4 routers will be used in the system, each handling about 10 wireless clients each.<br />2) wireless client should be seamlessly jump between routers when needed<br />3) each router must be able to talk to any clients connected with other routers (any client in the system)<br />4) wireless client connected to one router should be able to talk to wireless client connected to different router.<br />5) only wireless interface will be used for the whole system, ie No physical Ethernet port is available in the router hardware.<br />6) only needs routing functionality and no need for internet access for the client.<br />7) routers will have static ip and clients will take dynamic ip.<br />8) traffic produced by each client will be maximum of 32KB/s<br />9) going to use AR9331 based router, hence it is only single band.</p><p>Please suggest me a simple approach for the system.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>grajeshkannan</strong> on 1 Dec 2016, 12:22)</p>

					<p>The condition on absence of ethernet is strange. Or routers could be connected via it itself? In this case they could be just WiFi-bridges. In case of absence of ethernet they should connect to existing WiFi as clients, and provide WiFi bridge as WiFi servers.</p>									</div>

					<p>Use 802.11s mesh mode for the inter-router links.&nbsp; Also configure an AP mode interface on each router.&nbsp; Simply bridge both interfaces into the lan network (along with the ethernet ports you&#039;re not using.., but if you do want something wired to this network, you can just plug it into any one of the routers).&nbsp; You don&#039;t need any routing or firewalling here.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming all your clients will be configured with static IP&#039;s.&nbsp; You can make one of the routers a DHCP server and it will serve the whole network.</p><p>With single band, single radio routers everything will have to be on the same channel.&nbsp; You could get higher bandwidth performance using dual band routers, then the router to router links are on the other band.&nbsp; This also lets you use different channels for the AP&#039;s.&nbsp; If your clients are low-traffic devices like bar code readers you don&#039;t need to worry much about that.&nbsp; If you&#039;re trying to move lots of audio or video you&#039;d want the dual band network.</p><p>Seamlessly handing off between different APs as the user physically moves around is something that wifi doesn&#039;t do very well.&nbsp; A lot depends on the client&#039;s driver.&nbsp; Most drivers try to hold onto a very weak signal and only look for a new one some time after it completely drops.&nbsp; There is 802.11r which is supposed to help that.&nbsp; If you need really good performance in that regard you could look at proprietary &quot;enterprise wifi&quot; systems like Unifi.&nbsp; With those a control device is looking at the whole network and trying to force clients onto the best AP for them.&nbsp; These do assume a wired network infrastructure though.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 1 Dec 2016, 01:31)</p>

					<p>Thanks @ulmwind, @mmk24 and @ckm for your inputs.</p><p>Sorry forgot to mention this.<br />System only needs routing functionality and no need for internet access for the client.</p><p>Also router&#039;s can take static IP, but clients will be offered dynamic IP, since the no of clients using a router at a time can be random. 10 is maximum count though (just a software restriction for the system - nothing to do with system restriction)</p><p>I should not use Ethernet interface, since the router we are going to produce does not come with a Ethernet port.</p><p>I&#039;m going to use AR9331 based router, hence it is only single band.</p><p>The data traffic is only going to be under 32KB/s from each client, hence traffic is not going to be an issue in the system.</p><p>Clients are going to be mobile phones using android and ios, so i guess wifi switching should be handled sufficiently well.</p><p>Thanks a lot guys, your inputs are very helpful and useful for thinking along the lines of the requirement.</p><p>Any addition information you give is very helpful.</p>									</div>

					<p>Mesh 802.11s works really well on ath9k.&nbsp; It is built in to OpenWrt except that the web configuration isn&#039;t complete.&nbsp; You will need to add your mesh interface to /etc/config wireless manually:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-iface

        option key &#039;pre-shared secret key&#039;</code></pre></div><p>The routers (nodes) don&#039;t even need to have an IP address for the network to work.&nbsp; All the switching of packets is done at layer 2, based on MAC address.&nbsp; The only reason to assign IPs to the nodes is to be able to log into a node and administer it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 1 Dec 2016, 16:09)</p>

					<p>My impression is that B.A.T.M.A.N. was intended more for city-wide networks with hundreds of nodes in the network.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had no problem at all with 11s on my use, though it was always only 3 or 4 nodes.&nbsp; I started out with &quot;OpenMesh&quot; (which is, ironically, closed-source)-- it uses BATMAN.&nbsp; One thing about BATMAN that I did not like is that it needs exactly the same software version and usually the same hardware at all the nodes, or they will refuse to link up.</p><p>The new Google Wifi and several other proprietary things are using meshes now.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in exactly what driver they are using.</p>									</div>

The system where I&#039;m going to deploy this solution is same as AP mode you have described &quot;master is providing some central service such as file storage&quot;.&nbsp; All the clients (in all the routers) will send information/stats to the main router and main router then relays this information to the required clients. Main router will also manage the clients as two or more groups to let them have private communication.<br />I&#039;m worried about the complexity of mesh network and nightmares of fixing if something goes wrong. How challenging is debugging with mesh ? Please share your experience in debugging a mesh issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Your system is then client-server rather than peer-to-peer.&nbsp; You will have a server which is also a wifi AP and &quot;range extenders&quot; which can be deployed to cover a larger area.</p><p>If you use a AP(WDS) - STA(WDS) model, this is very simple to understand, and it could work to a degree.&nbsp; You could hope that if you deploy a range extender which is too far out to directly connect to the server, it will connect to the AP side of one of the other range extenders and make a two-hop link automatically.&nbsp; This will occur if you set everything to the same SSID and don&#039;t constrain the connection to only one BSSID (MAC of&nbsp; the server) </p><p>But that allows a troubling situation where two range extenders decide to connect to each other instead of the server.&nbsp; That network is of course, broken.&nbsp; If you&#039;re sure you only need one hop of range extension, the range extender STAs can be configured to connect only to the server and avoid that problem.</p><p>If two-hop range extension (user -- range extender -- range extender -- server) is possibly necessary, I&#039;d definitely use a mesh.</p><p>Mesh troubleshooting has three major techniques:<br />Ping the IP&#039;s of other nodes and the server, like you would do with any network.<br />iw dev &lt;mesh device&gt; station dump : shows many details about other nodes which have esablished a direct link to this one (MAC address, signal strength, bit rate, etc pretty much like you see in AP mode).<br />iw dev &lt;mesh device&gt; mpath dump : shows the mesh routing table, which if mesh is operating properly, will have all the nodes listed, be they directly or indirectly linked.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 2 Dec 2016, 18:24)</p>
