					<p>Hi, I&#039;m trying to resuscitate the n810 support of OpenWRT.&nbsp; I&#039;ve trimmed off the &quot;broken&quot; flag<br />on its depends to re-enable the platform so I can see how badly broken it is.</p><p>It wanted a kernel image (for fallback booting) which is no longer hosted at OpenWRT, but I found a copy elsewhere, no problem.</p><p>Now I&#039;m seeing it blow up because, although I only selected X11, it has pulled in qt-everywhere and is trying to build it.&nbsp; The include path doesn&#039;t point at the freetype header files, but this is correct--QT isn&#039;t configured, so the build system correctly left off an include reference to it.</p><p>So why is qt-everywhere being pulled in, even though qt4 is most assuredly not selected?</p><p>Thanks!<br />Andy Valencia</p>									</div>
