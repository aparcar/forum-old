					<p>Hello,</p><p>I want to use OpenDNS, but that search page is driving me nuts every time some site doesnâ€™t exists. But they have the ability to disable that and behave normally if you have an account. But my IP is dynamically changing. They support that too, but I just donâ€™t know what and how to take the advantage of it with Kamikaze. I think there is a perl script that do this with OpenDNS but isnâ€™t Perl too heavy for WRT54GL? Tomato firmware has this capability to dynamically update your IP to OpenDNS built inâ€¦</p><p>Is anybody over here done this with Kamikaze? If so, could you please share? Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>x-wrt has a buildin ddns support in its web interface, you need to install ddns package and a package for your ddns provider(saying opendns), I am not sure if opendns is in the supported list, mine doesn&#039;t, so I have to write a script and put it to crond to do it.</p>									</div>

					<p>With crond OpenDNS would be updated only by time interval right? How about adding a cache file like ez-ipupdate uses to keep from abusing your dyndns provider. Or is there any way to use ez-ipupdate to send the update to OpenDNS along with dyndns.com? I would like to only send an update to OpenDNS when my dynamic ip address actually changes.</p>									</div>
