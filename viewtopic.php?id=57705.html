					<p>No... as far as I&#039;m aware there isn&#039;t support for this yet. It&#039;s very similar hardware wise to the TP-Link TL-WR841ND v9 and as such I&#039;ve got the Ethernet working and the flash is visible, so it&#039;s possible to netboot ( but there are no pre-compiled images. ) It needs someone who knows how these devices boot so that OpenWRT can be installed in flash to replace RouterOS.</p><p>It may also be possible to use metarouter ( not sure if it&#039;s actually supported on those boxes ) but if so it would have to be a small image.</p>									</div>
