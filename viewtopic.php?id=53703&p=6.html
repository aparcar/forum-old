					<p>Out of curiosity, I booted up an older laptop with a wireless g card to run some quick speedtests. However, my results were ok. So, there is no <em>general</em> problem with wireless g on the Archer C7 and Chaos Calmer.</p><p>My internet connection is 50mbit/s. With a wireless n device, speedtests usually show 49-50mbit/s - so there&#039;s no slowdown here. With the older laptop that only supports wireless g, the results of different speedtests vary between 19-24mbps (depending on which speedtest I use).
