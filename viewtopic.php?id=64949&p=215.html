					<p>Ok, I found the problem with adblock and dnscrypt-proxy 2.0.&nbsp; Adblock runs 4 checks to see if the dns backend (dnscrypt-proxy in this case) is running.&nbsp; With @InkblotAdmirer&#039;s init.d script, it passes 3.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    if [ -z &quot;${adb_dns}&quot; ]     || [ -z &quot;${adb_dnsdeny}&quot; ] || [ ! -d &quot;${adb_dnsdir}&quot; ]
#    || [ ! -x &quot;$(command -v ${adb_dns})&quot; ] 
    then
        f_log &quot;err&quot; &quot;&#039;${adb_dns}&#039; not running, DNS backend not found&quot;
    fi</code></pre></div><p>from the line I commented out, you can guess which it isn&#039;t passing. </p><p>Until someone comes up with a fix, which I&#039;m sure is a simple entry to be added to the init.d file for dnscrypt-proxy v2, I&#039;ll just leave adblock.sh as shown above.&nbsp; Works great!</p><p><strong>Edit2</strong>:&nbsp; I can&#039;t understand why the expression [ ! -x &quot;$(command -v ${adb_dns})&quot; ] where ${adb_dns} equals dnscrypt-proxy is returning true in adblock.sh.&nbsp; If I do &quot;command -v dnscrypt-proxy&quot; at an SSH prompt, I get a response, the directory where dnscrypt-proxy is installed.&nbsp; I even wrote a simple test script, and the ENTIRE expression returns false everytime:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#/bin/sh

adb_dns=dnscrypt-proxy
adb_dnsdeny=&quot;awk &#039;{print \$0}&#039;&quot;
adb_dnsdir=&quot;${adb_dnsdir:-&quot;/tmp&quot;}&quot;

echo &quot;starting script&quot;
echo

if [ -z &quot;${adb_dns}&quot; ] || [ -z &quot;${adb_dnsdeny}&quot; ] || [ ! -x &quot;$(command -v ${adb_dns})&quot; ] || [ ! -d &quot;${adb_dnsdir}&quot; ]
then
        echo &quot;it didn&#039;t work, dnscrypt-proxy isn&#039;t running&quot;
fi</code></pre></div><p>It never outputs &quot;It didn&#039;t work, dnscrypt-proxy isn&#039;t running&quot; unless I remove an ! or something else to make it return true.&nbsp; WHY DOES IT WORK HERE BUT NOT IN ADBLOCK.SH??!!?&nbsp; I&#039;m driving myself crazy.&nbsp; It&#039;s the EXACT same expression and variables.</p><p>Just FYI, in the init.d script for dnscyrpt-proxy v2, i changed all references of dnscrypt-proxy-v2 to be simply dnscrypt-proxy.</p><p><strong>EDIT3</strong>: I&#039;m a dingus!&nbsp; I figured it out!&nbsp; For some reason, adblock doesn&#039;t use the default system PATH value. Instead it defines it&#039;s own PATH near the very top of adblock.sh.&nbsp; I added the install directory where I have dnscrypt-proxy v2 installed and now it works fine without having to comment out any lines or portions of lines.&nbsp; </p><p>I don&#039;t know why they coded it like that, and I hate them for it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>So everything is working fine now, with no modifications needed to adblock.sh (except for modifying the PATH variable in adblock.sh if you have dnscrypt-proxy v2 installed in a non-standard location) if you use the init.d file that @InkblotAdmirer wrote here: <a href="https://github.com/InkblotAdmirer/custom_feed/tree/master/dnscrypt-proxy-v2/files">https://github.com/InkblotAdmirer/custo … y-v2/files</a> as long as you change all references to dnscrypt-proxy-v2 to be dnscrypt-proxy (inversely you can change all references to dnscrypt-proxy in adblock.sh to be dnscrypt-proxy-v2).</p><p>What sucess looks like:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Fri Apr  6 00:19:24 2018 user.info adblock-[3.5.1]: start adblock processing (start)
