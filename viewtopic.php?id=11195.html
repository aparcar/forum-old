					<p>I have a WRTSL54GS running Kamikaze, and I&#039;d like to perform daily backups from my workstation to a disk connected to my router, and then have the router sync the backup to Amazon S3 on a weekly basis. What&#039;s the best tool to perform the sync to S3? I tried using s3sync.rb, but it had too many ruby dependencies.</p>									</div>
