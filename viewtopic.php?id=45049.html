					<p>Hello,</p><p>has someone experience with the WDR3600 Router? I search for a new Router because&nbsp; my current WR841 V8 runs pretty bad with OpenWrt. The Wifi connection is only stable with HT20 mode, but i need more Wifi power. </p><br /><p>My question: Is the WDR3600 Wifi &quot;rock stable&quot; with 600Mbps (MIMO) ?</p>									</div>

					<p>As long as there will be wifi bugs unsolved, there&#039;s no tp link (with atheros) I can recommend for the best stability. Btw. my wr841n runs pretty stable, only I need to restart wifi from cron.</p>									</div>

					<p>Which version does your wr841 have? If i enable HT40 mode and make a big download (~10gb) the wifi drops form&nbsp; ~230mb/s to 1mb/s and the download crash. With HT20 everything seem to work, but its to slow for hd streaming (NAS to TV).</p>									</div>

					<p>I have v8, but I&#039;m a light wifi user, heavy transfers I make over the cables, mainly because of interference, I live in a top floor and I can barely make 30mbits in the same room <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> On another place in the cellar I made up to 80 mbits, but I have not tested it for a very long.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />Does anyone know how&#039;s it going HT40 on Barrier Braker? I am telling you this because I am experiencing the same network instability with HT40 on a TL-WR2543N running AA. As you already said, HT20 solved the problem for the time being.</p>									</div>
