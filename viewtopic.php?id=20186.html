					<p>So, I know, I probably should have taken a little more time reading through all of the changes in 8.09 before I dove in but I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; Anyway, I loaded 8.09 on a WRT54G (v3) fine and everything was working.&nbsp; However, I was changing the config over to just a straight up bridged mode and somehow locked myself out of the unit.&nbsp; I realize that in 8.09 nvram is useless -- however I am trying to figure out how I can wipe it and start over.&nbsp; Most of the links in the docu are broken and I get an nginx error page.&nbsp; So, yes, I have looked -- now I am just asking for some help.&nbsp; I was sick of DDWRT and saw a lot of great new things in OpenWRT that I wanted to give a shot with, but if I bricked it I bricked it...</p><p>Anybody?&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>TIA!<br />--windexh8er</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks nas!</p><p>So, quick rundown for any newbs to OpenWRT -- failsafe on the WRT54G (mine is v3 - ymmv) is achieved by pressing the &#039;reset&#039; button on the back after the DMZ light comes on during boot.&nbsp; At this point the router should respond to 192.168.1.1 a short while later (i.e. ICMP / telnet).&nbsp; At that point I just wanted to start fresh, so I did the following two items:</p><p>1) I wanted to revert back to the original JFFS.&nbsp; When in failsafe you do not have access to JFFS (only SquashFS), so no changes are writable.&nbsp; To wipe out all settings in JFFS you may have configured (*cough*botched*cough*) just type: &#039;firstboot&#039; at the command prompt (obviously without the quotes) and let it do it&#039;s thing.</p><p>2) I wanted to wipe out all of the cruft left in nvram from other firmware I had on the WRT54G.&nbsp; To do this I just ran &#039;mtd -r erase nvram&#039;.&nbsp; This step is probably not required since Kamikaze ignores those settings, but I&#039;m just lame like that and I want to know that there&#039;s nothing in there that shouldn&#039;t be.&nbsp; Again, ymmv, it worked for me and I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a downside to doing that, but just my $0.02.&nbsp; BTW, the &#039;-r&#039; in the mtd command will reboot the router after it&#039;s done erasing nvram.&nbsp; I just did that because I had completed step 1 and wanted it to reboot.&nbsp; You, obviously, don&#039;t need to do that right away if you choose not to.</p><p>Thanks again to nas for pointing me in the right direction -- I know, lame I didn&#039;t run across failsafe mode earlier and I feel slightly dumb about it, but it was an honest mistake and maybe this final post will help some other shmuck in the near future.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>--windexh8er</p>									</div>
