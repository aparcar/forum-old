					<p>Hi all, I have a tl-wr841n v7.1 on which I have installed Openwrt Bleeding Edge r29289. Right now I&#039;m using the router to connect to an access point and have connected my PC to the router via LAN and nearly everything works fine. I have two problems, though, that I though I&#039;d ask about, here:</p><p>1. Is it possible to set up the router in a way that it would act as both an access point and a station, in Pseudobridge mode, and still keep the LAN connectivity? If yes, how?</p><p>2. Right now, for some reason, I can not connect to any remote server through any port other than 21, 22, 23, 53, 443 and a maybe a few others, even though I have completely disabled the firewall on the router. This is preventing me from using torrent/IRC/emule and even connecting to FTP servers in passive mode. Bigger problem is that I&#039;m not sure whether the problem is from the access point I&#039;m connecting to or my configuration on the router and I don&#039;t have any laptops or anything to directly connect to the access point and see whether the problem would persist or not. My question is, am I supposed to do any specific configuration for complete port forwarding or this should be fine out of the box? I can&#039;t seem to be able to find relayd&#039;s configuration file, if any, to have a look and see if I can find anything in that, either. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Okay, I found the answer to the second problem, the damn access point I&#039;m connected to isn&#039;t forwarding the other ports and there is nothing I can do about it. Still, I&#039;d really appreciate it if someone helps me with the first issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Virtual ap bridged to lan. Virtual sta relayed to lan. In theory it should work. In reality it might not. If you read hard, you&#039;ll find there are certain dhcp issues with relayd in 10.03.1-rc5 &amp; rc6. What else do you want to know?</p>									</div>
