					<p>I was having some problems with qos when i set the values on /etc/config/qos to my real values. 256/128<br />The main hsfc qdisc is created with -70kbit of rate , which is really strange.

					<p>Actual overhead heavily depends on the type of your line, so it can&#039;t be easily put into some formula. Some schedulers like HTB have their own overhead parameters, ie they account for some overhead for every packet they send. That&#039;s the solution I&#039;m using. However this too does not necessarily relate to actual overhead. Depending on the type of your line calculating actual overhead can be extremely complicated especially when packets are first encapsulated into another protocol and then transferred in fixed size cells and so on, so there isn&#039;t really any scheduler that does it 100% right.</p>									</div>

					<p>If all that formula does is change upload/download rate, it should just reduce it by a fixed percentage (and the overhead variable itself could represent the percentage you want to use). Anything else is just random. Anyway that&#039;s how I do it in all my QoS scripts, like this: TOTAL_RATE=$((($RATE*(100-$RATE_SUB_PERCENT))/100)). I obtain the rate of my DSL line directly from my DSL modem and reduce it by 5 percent to be on the safe side. Additionally the HTB scheduler I use also tries to account for overhead (in my case &#039;mpu 96 overhead 50&#039;), as no matter how many percent you take from the rate, you can probably always abuse overhead if you send lots of very small packets.</p>									</div>

					<p>Correct settings depend on your specific situation. I simply took what they used in this thread <a href="http://www.opensubscriber.com/message/lartc@mailman.ds9a.nl/1103651.html">http://www.opensubscriber.com/message/l â€¦ 03651.html</a> - they&#039;re probably not the correct values for me either but it works great nevertheless and so I didn&#039;t change them yet. Either you get some useful information about overhead from your modem so you can actually determine optimal settings or you have to try and guess what works best for you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry that I&#039;m not yet as knowledgable as as you are, but I stumbled upon this thread and your topic seems related.</p><p>I have a 10MBit DSL line. And with a cleared iptables I get a net download to the effect of 9600kbit/sec. The thing is, once qos is active the downstream breaks down to about 50% that. Only if I increase option dowload to 20000 I get the same ballpark performance. Why is it that I have to *double* the rate here?</p><p>slightly tangentially, is it even possible to really shape/queue the downstream? Server&#039;s send you data down the pipe, which cannot really be queued properly, right? What is this value for?</p>									</div>

In an optimal situation you would have to be able to configure traffic shaping on the provider side. In a good situation you would be able to use more sophisticated methods for downstream shaping (like scaling tcp window sizes and the like). In the current situation all you can do is drop packets and hope that it will prevent queues / slow the other side down.</p><p>Considering that this situation is suboptimal it actually does work quite well. Dropping a packet here and there is a low price to pay if you get a good balanced overall service quality in return.</p><p>Even so, it&#039;s still much more important to shape upload properly, as there is only so much you can do with download shaping. So when rolling your own solution, think about the upload first.</p>									</div>
