					<p>Hello,</p><p>I imagine a network configuration for my new toy as follows:<br />- it communicates with &quot;WAN&quot; (I mean the subnet, where the wt3020 is placed into - let&#039;s say 192.168.1.0/24) through wifi; optionally through its wired WAN port instead of wifi, if it is connected (to the WAN&#039;s router)<br />- it can communicate with &quot;LAN&quot; through wifi and also through its wired LAN port<br />- its &quot;LAN&quot; is a separate subnet (let&#039;s say 192.168.2.0/24), and doesn&#039;t really matter if a client of this subnet can see a client of the WAN, or vice versa<br />- please note that using wifi for both &quot;WAN&quot; and &quot;LAN&quot; is a valid scenario here</p><p>The idea behind is that the (wired or wireless) clients of the &quot;LAN&quot; subnet get the internet through the wt3020, and it gets the internet (via wifi or ethernet) from the dumb router of the &quot;WAN&quot;. So, I don&#039;t necessarily have to physically access the router of the &quot;WAN&quot;.</p><p>Unfortunately I&#039;m not an experienced network engineer, so my primal problem is not even the &quot;how?&quot; but the &quot;is it possible?&quot;.<br />I tried to google after the topic, but unfortunately googling after &#039;wifi&#039;, &#039;lan&#039; and &#039;wan&#039; is not a lucky constellation here.<br />And yes, of course I&#039;ve read through <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#routed_client_mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clien â€¦ lient_mode</a> but don&#039;t feel myself much smarter after that. The only thing that I&#039;ve noticed is that using wifi simultaneously to both up and down directions is not mentioned anywhere. However I&#039;m neither 100% sure about that.</p><p>So, is there anyone around who has an opinion about the feasibility of the above?<br />Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>The wiki is way to complicated on this.&nbsp; A default configuration is close to what you want.</p><p>1. If your ISP router is providing addresses in the 192.168.1.1 range, change your LAN IP to something else.<br />2. Make a client mode wifi interface, configure it with the SSID and encryption of the AP that you are going to use to get Internet, and put it in the wan network.&nbsp; I do not recommed using the &#039;join network&#039; button-- configure manually.<br />3. Go to wan physical settings and turn OFF bridge mode.&nbsp; The wifi interface must be the only thing attached to the wan network.&nbsp; You can go to lan settings and put both Ethernet ports in the LAN.<br />4. Set up a wifi AP interface if desired, and put it in lan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the reply!</p><p>So, then it is doable. Great news!<br />(TL/DR: I&#039;ve hidden a question into section 3) .)</p><p>During my experiments on building custom package(s) - == what essentials can I stuff into the ROM before extrooting - I&#039;ve used the &#039;routed client with masquerade&#039; recipe. (It nicely covers the subnet warning of 1) too: &quot;If the target network uses the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, you must change the default LAN IP address to a different subnet, e.g. 192.168.2.1&quot;)<br />Points 1) and 2) of your answer equals that (or the routed one - its recipe contains only the &#039;bridge&#039; term) then? (I assume yes.)</p><p>3) So this means that connecting to the ISP router wired or wireless on demand is not possible at all? Or is it just too complicated? (I&#039;m okay with only having wifi connection.)</p><p>4) Seems straightforward in theory. I&#039;ll see how it works out in reality. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>And yes, your recipe worked well. Thanks again for your help!</p>									</div>
