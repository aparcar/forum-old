					<p>HI everyone,<br />I really appreciate peoples giving answers on this forum, God will give them rewards for helping others.<br />I have ubiquiti routerstation pro and I also have asus n16 routers as well and I would like to add that asus router as an access point to my primary router which is ubiquiti routerstation pro. I would really appreciate if someone can help me step by step to hookup and configure that as well because I am new to this router and I haven&#039;t worked on openwrt before.<br />I will appreciate response.<br />Thanks</p>									</div>
