					<p>Hello.</p><p>On and off for the last few months, I have been trying to build proper images for the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/engenius/esr-6650">Senao/Engenius ESR-6650</a>, so that whatever other users of this router that may be out there do not have the same issues I have had getting OpenWRT on it. (I have done so, but only through several consecutive TFTP and sysupgrade images for other systems, and several firewall tweaks).</p><p>However, I have run into a roadblock. When using Buildroot, I can successfully get several images. However, I cannot get the important sysupgrade or initramfs-jffs2 images. I have tried tweaking the target image options, as well as stripping down the included packages and kernel patches to the lowest possible point, to no avail.</p><p>On the official snapshots download page, you can see several sysupgrade images for very similar systems, so I know it&#039;s possible.</p><p>Anyone know the problem?</p>									</div>
