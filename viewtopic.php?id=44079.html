					<p>Howdy,</p><p>this is my first encounter with OpenWrt, I&#039;m familar with basic networking concepts ...</p><p>I want to install OpenWrt on my new Wifi-Router (TP-LInk Tl WDR4900 N900) and connect it to my LTE-internet-router.<br />Please have a look at this sketch: <a href="http://imgur.com/6ajumeq">http://imgur.com/6ajumeq</a></p><br /><p>For testing purpose I have OpenWrt installed on a similar device; I&#039;m working with the graphical UI.<br />The devices are connected, setup WAN, LAN and Wifi interfaces, DHCP and DNS are attached to (?) the LAN interface.</p><p>However the WAN port does not seem to transmit any data (the device was running fine with the original firmware).<br />Can anybody please walk me through the steps to configure the device properly?</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>So, for now, the WAN issue is with Openwrt on the &quot;similar device&quot;,&nbsp; as you have yet to flash the wdr4900, right?&nbsp; The test device is a .... (as nebbia88 asks) and is running Attitude Adjustment or Barrier Breaker (trunk)? The latter is what runs on the wdr4900, so it is best that your test device runs that too.</p>									</div>
