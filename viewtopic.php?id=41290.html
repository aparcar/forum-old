					<p>given that you have a WNDR3700, you should try flashing a non-openwrt and see if the same behavior is present. <br />Since the router has a good TFTP window period and instructions, try flashing official NETGEAR firmware that belongs to the router (v1 or v2) and then you can confirm for sure what is the cause of the problem.</p><p>I&#039;m assuming you can flash the needed firmware through the use of TFTP by connecting to the 1st or 2nd port.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>C</p>									</div>

					<p>If you have trouble after a successful flash to the original firmware, you probably have a hardware failure (related to the switch chip?).</p><p>But it sounds like you can&#039;t contact the router at all, right? No connection to the Netgear GUI?</p><p>Are you sure that the TFTP flash succeeded? What happened to the leds during the during the flash? And how long did it take for the reboot to happen after the flash process started?</p><p>(With 3700v1 the power led should stop blinking when the router has received the image with TFTP. Then it should take maybe 2-3 minutes for the flash to complete before the router automatically reboots. With 3700v2/3800 the orange&amp;green power leds additionally blink for a while just before the reboot.)</p>									</div>
