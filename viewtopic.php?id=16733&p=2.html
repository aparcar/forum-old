					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Here are some news on my progress: after a certain number of hours and quite a lot of flash time, I finally managed to get the network card recognized under 2.6.

I&#039;ll try later tonight as my LAN setup may be the problem (ie: gigabit switch with dot1q vlans). </p><p>Basically, you need to patch tg3.h to add the PHY id, and also ssb_gige.h (include/linux/ssb/) to correct a little error referencing CONFIG_BCM947xx instead of CONFIG_BCM47xx.</p><p>Will try to post more later...</p><p>Finally, some success reward all these hours without sleep ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>Okay - I&#039;m delivering one of these right now as it seems very propable that openwrt will be ported on it and it&#039;s closest to wrt-350n that ain&#039;t no longer available (and people who owned it and would had been willing to sell one, have already abandoned their routers) as I get benefits that I was needing with this:<br /> - faster cpu that one in wrt54gs<br /> - usb (I rather use usb instead of soldering parts on pcb)<br /> - kernel 2.6</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&#039;t know if I can help a lot, as my skills on system level programming are more or less; none <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />And I also am not very much willing to brick my device either as I wasn&#039;t interested in soldering (so no serial or jtag for me)..</p><p>But anyway, if there comes time when a stress test or draft-n test or something similar seems to be required, I might be able to give it a go..</p><p>This router for now doesn&#039;t come to production environment, not until january - so I can do some tests if I later on can re-flash stock firmware on it - or openwrt will be functional enough so I can use it in &quot;production environment&quot;..

					<p>I hope to get wired Ethernet support quite soon, however I&#039;m far from optimistic for the wireless card: it is an infamous bcm4322, not currently supported by any OSS drivers, with a proprietary driver delivered by broadcom, but I guess it&#039;s not working on MIPS, and even if it was working, it requires to disable ssb which is required for tg3 to recognize the switch... Chicken and egg...</p><p>Wireless support is totally dependant on the b43 team that is actually busy reverse-engineering the Broadcom drivers but with no &quot;visible&quot; results until now.

Why not use one from WRT610n? One used on different models most likely after all wouldn&#039;t work - wrt610n has dual radios and a/b/g/n connectivity.. There&#039;s gotta to be a source where earlier proprietary driver was from after all.. And as b43 team says: BCM 4322 802.11a/b/g/n (Has PCI-ID 0x432B) - This device has an N Phy. There is no support for any Draft 802.11n features.<br />Therefore it&#039;s very unlikely that driver would be available any time soon (maybe in 2 years, and that propably ain&#039;t enough time even if they would get donations) as they are still working on previous versions of hardware and have got so less results in eyes of a normal user in years, that I guess maybe there&#039;s a proper driver for wrt54gs after 2 years and maybe then we can start expecting some results on draft-N nics..

					<p>Judas Priest that DD-WRT thread exploring the WRT610n is long!&nbsp; I admire their serious &amp; quite expert efforts but most of it seems to be going to waste as with all things DD-WRT it ends up depending on if BrainSlayer takes an interest in it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit mysterious to me that later in the thread they refer to the place I soldered on my serial port lines as a &quot;second location&quot; which implies there is a first location I find as yet no description of.</p><p>I&#039;ll try to cull through it and extract the useful bits into the Wiki page, probably take a week.&nbsp; GPIO info, pin descriptions, etc.</p><p>JTAG doable if I can find the right headers at Fry&#039;s or someplace.&nbsp; First time I&#039;ve seen a board with JTAG for the WiFi cards.&nbsp; OEM is CyberTan so might be some CyberTan sources of information on this unit also.&nbsp; More research in order.</p><p>Jake 1981, yeah if you want something TODAY this is not your best bet.&nbsp; In my house right now I am still using a WRT54GS v1.0 as router (OpenWRT 8.09RC1) and an old WAP55AG with Linksys firmware for 802.11a traffic.&nbsp; Old hardware works just fine I&#039;m not really personally highly motivated for latest &amp; greatest Ultra-Turbo performance I just want my household to run smooth &amp; solid.&nbsp; Older hardware running newer OS just fine for that.&nbsp; I like to compare notes with other people with their Uber-Products and ask &quot;yeah how many times a week you have to reboot it?&quot; cause my WRT54G-class stuff may not be loaded with buzzword features but it &quot;just works&quot; and I can&#039;t recall the last time I&#039;ve had to reboot a Kamikaze router.</p><p>Looking further out I think this WRT610n is a kick-ass little piece of hardware and fun to experiment on.&nbsp; If only Broadcom weren&#039;t such buttheads about their drivers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 19 Nov 2008, 20:45)</p>

Corrections and contributions are welcome.</p><p>- About MIPS: the CPU running in embedded systems like this router are generally not intel x86 derivative. There many options on the market, and many (if not most) are built around the MIPS architecture. The problem is that these two types of CPUs do not use the same &quot;language&quot; (not the same assembler), so a program that you compile to run on a standard PC won&#039;t work on a MIPS CPU. If you have the source code, you can adapt it to support multiple architecture, and compile it for both architectures ( this will produce one binary per type of CPU). You certainly already understood, that if you don&#039;t have source code, you&#039;re out of luck.</p><p>- Broadcom has released a proprietary (ie: closed source), but only for x86 and x86_64 (no MIPS release). In order to protect their &quot;intellectual property&quot; (ie:owning the inventions created by other&#039;s brains), they hide most of the information and knowledge about their chips into some source code they will never distribute except perhaps to their direct clients (ie: linksys, asus, dlink, netgear....). These guys then build their final product and ship only the binary to public. Public can then use the driver but only for the specific uses intended by the manufacturers. Lets add one point of honesty: another reason for hiding code is compliance (have a look at <a href="http://linuxwireless.org/en/developers/Regulatory)">http://linuxwireless.org/en/developers/Regulatory)</a>. Lets add one point of speculation: it&#039;s far more in the interest of routers manufacturers to lock the source code. I guess that the guys in these companies just get mad when they see the amount of features you can put on these boxes with openwrt. They can&#039;t sell boxes providing all these features at the price we get them, or they would have a hard time justifying the prices of their &quot;enterprises&quot; boxes, so they protect their advance by using secrecy...even if more than 90% of the software used in their boxes is open source. This is why everyone will correctly point out that they suck!</p><p>- SSB is an inter-chip communication bus (like PCI) that, IIRC, has specifically been developed by Broadcom. New drivers for managing this bus have been added to Linux 2.6, and both the tg3 driver for the ethernet card, and the b43 drivers are developed to use that ssb driver. However, the documentation shipped with broadcom&#039;s driver specifically exclude the activation of ssb in kernel, so we could not use tg3 and this driver at the same time (even there is a way to run the binary on MIPS, which IMHO is itself near to impossible)</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jake1981 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>By a proprietary driver; do you mean a driver used on, for e.g. Linksys wrt54gs&#039;s and other older products?

There is no support for any Draft 802.11n features.</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, linksys are based on 2.4 kernels. The only &quot;short term&quot; solution seems to integrate the proprietary wlan drivers and the proprietary ethernet driver (as it looks from the latest firmware at least). As I don&#039;t care for wlan at the moment, I&#039;m more willing to go for 2.6 for all the functionality it provides.</p><p>There is a source for recent or old proprietary drivers... The problem is that we don&#039;t and won&#039;t have access to it ;-)</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>jake1981 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Therefore it&#039;s very unlikely that driver would be available any time soon (maybe in 2 years, and that propably ain&#039;t enough time even if they would get donations) as they are still working on previous versions of hardware and have got so less results in eyes of a normal user in years, that I guess maybe there&#039;s a proper driver for wrt54gs after 2 years and maybe then we can start expecting some results on draft-N nics.. Just trying to be realistic here..</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, these guys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">are reverse-engineering</a> the beast and that&#039;s a hard, long and uncertain process... So you&#039;re right, until someone open up the specs (don&#039;t hope), the process will certainly be long, and I would not for a full working release of openwrt on this platform anytime soon...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sentenza</strong> on 19 Nov 2008, 23:50)</p>

					<p>Actually, I checked the donations list and noticed that money also is handy donation so I also decided to donate a small amount of money. First impression of donating to such group was that they might accept a device as a donation <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> Ofcourse, that might speed up things a bit, or atleast; give a good start <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> But yeah, I&#039;ll donate in december a small amount - after all - they&#039;ve done pretty good work and are not so far from publishing something that can be used.. They indeed have a long todo list, but it has been huge when they have started their project, so..</p><p>---</p><p>Okay, yes - I do understand that different architechtures cannot execute code compiled for other arch - I have a mis-understanding here, as a proprietary driver I thought you ment driver that ships as pre-compiled binary in firmware sources provided by Linksys. I just downloaded firmware sources and can verify that wrt610n is using 2.4 kernel after all <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I got this wrong impression from wiki page about wrt610n as there it states that system is running with 2.6 branch, but now when I look it more specific - I noticed that hostname is openwrt and it&#039;s more likely that these output copies are not from original system. So now I realize that as long as we want to use 2.6 branch, only option is to skip wireless part until b43 team provides us support (and linux wireless team makes changes to other parts of system so b43&#039;s driver could work properly).</p><p>Actually this finding is a good thing for me and also that is good that I wasn&#039;t able yet to afford this router as this new information makes it vital for me to think about it again.. Do I want fast wireless with 2.6 (then I need to look for other routers) or more powerful hardware on 2.6 without wireless - or do I compromise and stick to 2.4..</p><p>Well - maybe it&#039;s a good thing to consider this again, by being patient, time will pass and there&#039;s always a possibility that prices go lower (very unlikely, but you always can hope..)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jake1981</strong> on 19 Nov 2008, 23:47)</p>
