					<p>Yes, there are differences between the two. For one thing,Wifidog is more than just an access controller the open-source project also includes a captive portal application. Wifidog works with iptables, which is already in the firmware.Chillispot, however, offers features like MAC authentication and has radius internally.You are able to do more with Chillispot,but requires you do invest more time in developing your own version of the &quot;hotspotlogin.cgi&quot; sample script given with Chillispot.Yet, you are able to do more with Wifidog in terms of captive portal and standard access controller features.</p>									</div>
