					<p>Hi, I&#039;m very new to openwrt... I already read many of the information &amp; documentation on openwrt.org website, and I decided that I&#039;d like to install openwrt on a new device. Living in Europe I&#039;m not able to buy US product as the most of webshops ship WIFI defices only to US (or have a awfull shipping cost).</p><p>I found a WRT54G device from an Italian website at a reasonable price, but I&#039;m not able to find the product code (WRT54G-EU) in the Table of hardware. Does anyone in the forum know if the device is supported by openwrt?</p><p>You can find details of the device I plan to buy at <a href="http://www.eprice.it/default.aspx?sku=473818">http://www.eprice.it/default.aspx?sku=473818</a></p><p>thanks a lot,<br />blackdir</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello blackdir, the actual hardware inside the WRT54G is the same no matter what sort it is (-US -UK -EU -DE). The only differences in hardware are when you change version, like WRT54G v1, v2, v3, v4 etc. The -EU just means it has the european firmware loaded, -DE just means the firmware is in german but the hardware can take any firmware so you could load -UK firmware onto the -DE.</p><p>In short yes openWRT should work on a WRT54G-EU as long as the hardware is correct, which it should be.</p>									</div>

					<p>By reading this documentation <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54G">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … sys/WRT54G</a>.</p><p>It is also recommended that you read carefully the other docs in the wiki before you are installing OpenWrt. The wiki can be found athttp://wiki.openwrt.org/ also look at the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">TableOfHardware</a> and see if your router is supported by OpenWrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>olli_04</strong> on 30 Sep 2005, 12:43)</p>

I bought my router the other day and its still being posted to me, I wanted a v3 (wrt54gs) because it had better specs than the v4 but the shop was unable to tell me what version it was specifically as I ordered over the internet.</p><p>Once you have the router in your posession though you can check what version it is with the links the other two people posted.</p>									</div>
