					<p>Can AVM Fritzbox 7170 used as a Wlan client with open wrt? I don&#039;t want to use WDC. This is not an option. How good is the Wlan integration for that box or is the development still on-going?</p><p>Danny.</p>									</div>

					<p>well, it can be used(at least my FBF WLAN can be used when running OpenWrt). However, Fritz!Boxes do already have a kind of decent linux-based firmware, and the functionality you wish for can be achieved without openwrt as well. So to preserve your warranty I would suggest you stay with the AVM firmware. If you are from germany, I would like to recommend the german IP Phone Forum to you, avaible under <a href="http://ippf.eu">http://ippf.eu</a></p><p>If you still want to go for OpenWrt, just go on here :-) (If you have other questions, do so too :-D)</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, my understanding is that only parts of the Fritzbox software stack is open-source and the WLAN chip firmware is not. It doesn&#039;t support client mode and an alternative with the original FB firmware would be repeater functionality with WDC. However WDC only works with WPA/2 when home and repeater box are AVM devices. Thats why I was looking for open-wrt. I simply want to connect my LAN devices connected to the FB to an existing WLAN. I don&#039;t need AP functionality. I wonder what image do I need to choose? Can I install it via FB webgui?</p><p>Danny</p>									</div>
