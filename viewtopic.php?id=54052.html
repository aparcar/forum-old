					<p>I just got OpenWRT (Barrier Breaker) on my router. The router has two USB ports on it. I&#039;m a little noobish when it comes to this stuff so I&#039;m hoping someone can try to help me out.</p><p>I would like to be able to use my printer and scanner over my network so I don&#039;t have to plug it into the computer that wants to use it.</p><p>I found the p910nd page for printer sharing (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/p910nd.server">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/p910nd.server</a>). The first step on this page seems to say that I need USB Essentials. When I click that I&#039;m taken to another page but I can&#039;t find anything to click to download a package. Am I supposed to enter those command lines somewhere for it to install something necessary?</p><p>I have a Brother MFC-7340 which has a scanner. I use the scan function more than printing so getting scanning to work over the network would be more important to me.</p>									</div>

					<p>pretty sure USB support is included with the pre-compiled WDR3600 image. If you still have trouble getting it to work, consider this community build that includes the print server already: </p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=47382">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=47382</a></p><p>Use the barrier breaker version for best stability.</p>									</div>
