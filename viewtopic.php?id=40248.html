					<p>After configuring the build (selecting packages in make menuconfig etc.), you can do &quot;make download&quot; that will force the buildroot to download all needed packages. Then later, during the actual compilation make, there is no need to download.</p><p>The downloaded packages are stored on &#039;dl&#039; subdirectory of your buildroot, so you need to download each package only once (unless you destroy them with make distclean or manual delete).</p><p>An naturally you can also download manually each lackge, if you just look into the download path stored in the package Makefile, and use that to download the corect version with your browser, wgeet or whatever.</p>									</div>
