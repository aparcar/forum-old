					<p>Hello all,</p><p>Sorry for asking it, but I`m newbie in OpenWrt.</p><p>In my job, we run OpenWrt kamikaze_7.09 (kernel 2.6.25.7) in a dedicated Fujitsu server.<br />Unfortunately, this server is obsolete and the substitute has only USB 3.0 ports.</p><p>What is the easier way:</p><p>(1) Update my system kernel to 2.6.31 which, theoretically, supports USB 3.0.</p><p>or</p><p>(2) Adap kamikaze_7.09 to support USB 3.0.</p><p>Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>Without knowing why you feel bound to that old software I would recommend to research two options:</p><p>1) migrate an image of the working system onto a virtual machine like oracle&#039;s virtualbox, that might allow to pass on the new machines US3 ports as USB2 ports to the old VM.</p><p>2) figure out whether you can not actually upgrade the openwrt version to something that has not accumulated &gt; 5 years of unfixed kernel and user space bugs (assuming you do not run this old kamikaze server in complete isolation, but since it is a server I expect clients...).</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello moeller0,</p><p>This server is part of one of the products sold by my company.<br />As it is a product, I can&#039;t use any tool (like oracle&#039;s virtual box) to be like a &quot;bridge&quot; between server hardware and the OpenWrt application. <br />For example, if some problem happens and server goes down, it must be able to boot our OpenWrt application by itself and not by manually starting it using some VM.</p><p>Answering your second option, yes, I think it is possible to upgrade the openwrt to any version which contains support to USB 3.0. The problem here is that this product is in field for years, I would have to change all compilation environment and any change is risky.</p><p>The first step, I would say is to find out if the new server will really find problems with USB 3.0 ports.<br />I don&#039;t know if the older kernels handles the USB 3.0 ports like USB 2.0. Do you know ?<br />If yes, problem is solved and I don&#039;t need to do anything. Else, I will have to do some upgrade in it.</p><p>As I don&#039;t have the new Fujitsu server yet, I have no way to test.<br />I&#039;d just want to gain time if necessary.</p><p>So, if I really need to perform the upgrade, should I migrate everything to a recent openwrt version or I should I try to import USB 3.0 drivers manually to kamikaze_7.09 ?</p>									</div>

					<p>While you don&#039;t mention it explicitly, it sounds a lot like you&#039;re using bog-standard x86 hardware, in which case simply upgrading to the current firmware version(s) should be trivial (especially as x86, even for 5-10 year old specimens, tends to have a much larger performance envelope (RAM, CPU, disk), making the upgrade much less painful than on typical embedded devices with merely 16-32 MB RAM and 4-8 MB flash).</p>									</div>
