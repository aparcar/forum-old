					<p>Started flashing 1 of 6 of my TP-LINK WA901ND access points. All was well until I got to the point of installing LuCI Essentials. I get this error</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8216664813_3192453c97.jpg" alt="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8216664813_3192453c97.jpg" /></span></p><p>Obviously, since this is an access point there is no WAN port on it. It simply has one single LAN port, that&#039;s it. It seems like the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap</a> Dumb AP recommended network configuration pertains more to actual routers</p><p>My question is, how should I configure the network on the access point so that I can download and install LuCI? </p><p>Note: Currently I have the access point plugged into my network via a switch, changed the IP address to 192.168.1.249. Am accessing it via SSH, but my physical computer is not directly plugged into the access point. Don&#039;t know if that helps any. Hope I am being clear enough</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>uDaeth</strong> on 25 Nov 2012, 19:26)</p>

					<p>for example:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.lan.ipaddr=192.168.1.249
uci set network.lan.gateway=192.168.1.1
uci set network.lan.dns=192.168.1.1
uci commit
/etc/init.d/network restart</code></pre></div><p>note: happened to me that dns is not working when used in LAN network, if it happen fix manually with:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;nameserver 192.168.1.1&quot;&gt;/etc/resolv.conf</code></pre></div>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nebbia88</strong> on 25 Nov 2012, 20:03)</p>
