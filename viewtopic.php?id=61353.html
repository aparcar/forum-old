					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a D-Link DIR 890L router and looking to try out an open source firmware. The OpenWrt router database does not include the DIR 890L, should I assume its not supported or has anyone tried flashing this model ?</p><p>Nic</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nic</strong> on 6 Dec 2015, 11:54)</p>

					<p>Should I read this as OpenWRT will definitely not work on the Dlink DIR890L and I will brick the router if I attempt to flash it, or is there a fair chance the firmware will load and certain functionality may or may not be functioning ? I realise there is probably only one way to find out for sure but I like to understand what level of risk I am looking at if I attempt this.</p><p>It would also be useful to know if anyone attempted to load the firmware on 890L and if there is any active work ongoing to support this model.&nbsp; </p><p>Nic</p>									</div>

					<p>For now it&#039;s not supported, I can see that at least 1 wifi will not work for sure (no drivers), for other things hard to say...<br />You might help by trying to port it though.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
