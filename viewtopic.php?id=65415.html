					<p>Hello,<br />during firmware upgrade from latest stable version of Gargoyle to OpenWrt with LuCi on my router TP-Link TL-WDR4300 something weird happened. Progress bar got to 100%, router rebooted but after booting up all LED diodes are blinking. If I boot it up while pressing wps/reset button it goes straight to tftp client mode, but for reasons unknown to me even when it downloads the firmware file from my pc it wont install it. <br />At first I was using tftpd32 server, but firmware download never reached 100%. I always got some errors like &quot;timeout waiting for ack block&quot; or simply router was dropping the connection and&nbsp; rebooting itself.<br />Now I am using &quot;3Com tftp server&quot; and downloads go smoothly but the router still wont install the images.<br />I tried stripped tp-link firmware, OpenWrt factory, OpenWrt sysupgrade and gargoyle factory firmware images.</p><p>I am using windows 10 with disabled firewall, but I also tried this on windows XP with disabled firewall and some other laptops with windows 10 but the result was always the same.</p><p>I have made a video showing exactly how my router behaves during and after upload -&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/orVuZGQmFgw">https://youtu.be/orVuZGQmFgw</a></p><p>Any help would be very much appreciated.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>przemyslaw.wrzeszcz</strong> on 8 Jun 2016, 22:57)</p>
