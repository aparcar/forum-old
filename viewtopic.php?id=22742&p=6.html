					<p>You do great work here!<br />I plan to buy a WR1043ND in the next view days.<br />I&#039;ve read the whole discussion until here but I&#039;m not sure if i understood everything correctly. I never had a openwrt router before. I had a Asus WL500g Premium running dd-wrt some time ago.<br />openwrt seems to be organised different to dd-wrt. With dd-wrt i flashed the most recent image and in most cases everything was fine and sometimes a little bit finer than before :-)<br />with openwrt it seems that i have to compile the firmware image first. the things i&#039;ve read here were a little bit confusing for me. is there a simple step for step tutorial for compiling a firmware for a specific device? and how to apply patches? what is &quot;svn&quot; and what is &quot;trunk&quot; ?<br />The next thing which isn&#039;t clear is the webinterface. Does openwrt ship with or without a webinterface and what is LuCI and X-wrt? In this thread it seems that some settings should be faulty when they where set by the web interface. right?</p><p>I hope that someone can help me with this questions. I couldn&#039;t find any clear answers in the forum. The whole topic appears a little bit shematicly to me because i&#039;ve never seen a openwrt router in action before :-)</p><p>regards, chris</p>									</div>

					<p>check the Wiki, you can find out how to compile the firmware.<br />DD-WRT is more sutiable for end user which need a GUI, OpenWRT didn&#039;t come with one by default, the LuCI and X-WRT is GUI for OpenWRT, X-WRT is more easy to use, like tomato, LuCI will be more like the DD-WRT interface, but both of them just can do some simple config, same as DD-WRT<br />you don&#039;t need to Compile the firmware yourself, there are pre compile firmware, you can go to&nbsp; &nbsp;X-WRT to get firmware with X-WRT build in<br />SVN and trunk talking here mean the source code stuff<br />currently the 1043 are NOT support in trunk, cause the trunk didn&#039;t have support for the 1043 switch, that why we are here to patch the source.</p><p>if you really need a new router now, you can consider the 941ND, the only different is FLash size and it is not gigabit, but the 941 already support in trunk. (but dunno if v4 support)<br />lastly, if you don&#039;t want to get a serial, better avoid the TP-Link, as TP-Link don&#039;t have any firmware recovery function, if you brick the router, you need the serial to recovery it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DummyPLUG</strong> on 30 Jan 2010, 11:18)</p>

					<p>Thanks! Really helpful answer!<br />I&#039;ll read the wiki for compiling the firmware.<br />A GUI would be very comfortable for &quot;simple config&quot; like you call it. more advanced things have to be configured manually, that&#039;s clear to me. Both has its special advantages.<br />I&#039;ve &quot;choosen&quot; (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=101645">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=101645</a>) the 1043 because i need a gigabit switch, a 802.11n accesspoint a usb printserver and a DSL-Router at the same place. :-) and a router with a running unix has some more advantages ;-)<br />I think i&#039;ll give it a try and order a 1043.<br />To build a serial cable should not become a problem.<br />I did some Hardware modifications to the Asus WL500g Premium, too. But now, after it was running perfect for over one year it&#039;s dead. The router reboots after a random period of time. Could be some seconds or even some hours. The problem persits with the original firmware, too :-(</p>									</div>
