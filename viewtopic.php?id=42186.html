					<p>Hello. I am quite new to development in OPENWRT. I have learnt that in order to create a custom package from source code, one need to make a makefile for it . Can someone guide me how to make a makefile as I am not able to understand the BuildPackage variables. Plus one&#039;s source code would be embedded into make file or it will be saved in a separate file ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t mean to discourage you. However, it is better to start off from the right place, i.e. perusal the&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/start">OpenWRT Documentation</a>, particularly under the <strong>Building OpenWrt</strong> section.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. But i tried to follow OPENWRT buildroot&#039;s page but couldnot grasp the concept of compiling and creating new packages. When i googled it, I found very good manuals for creating packages <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
