					<p>Hi there. I need to &quot;share&quot; my IPTV with a STB box which is in another city and my internet provider don&#039;t have coverage there and i am little confused if all this is possible. So i will have 2 openwrt routers in each of the city. Is it possible to make a VPN connection between those 2 routers but only in specific LAN ports, i think this is called VLAN or switch in openwrt?</p><p>So for example when i plug my STB box in the router port in the city without coverage i can watch my IPTV there? Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Depends on how iptv is delivered.<br />If it sits on separate vlan then use openvpn in bridge mode<br />If its drm free and delivered with multicast then use udpxy</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 27 Mar 2016, 14:21)</p>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. It is on separate lan port coming out of my internet provider device which separate the iotv from the Internet (they are using MAG250 but over their local network over multicast i suppose). If i use openvpn in bridge mode, does it means that it will forward automatically UDP multicast packets? Thanks again</p>									</div>

Because bridge is bridge and its designed to be L2 transparent then it should work.</p>									</div>

					<p>Also gretap may help.<br />Its faster than openvpn and easy to configure. No user mode processes involved - only kernel.<br />But it has limitations. Requires external ip addresses on endpoints (may be only one if NAT has gre helper - havent tested). If ext addresses are problematic than grev6tap can help if both ends have ipv6.<br />This kind of tunnel does not offer any encryption or protection against traffic modification.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 31 Mar 2016, 11:05)</p>
