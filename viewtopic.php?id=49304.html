					<p>OVERVIEW:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>I was able to run helloworld program on my linksys wrt54g v3.1 router&nbsp; running white russian 0.9 openwrt firmware. </p><p>The available SDK for white russian 0.9 on the website is the striped down version of it. So it was working fine just for Helloworld program.</p><p>But now to implement my code I need the libpcap library to be added to SDK as I m using the pcap_t datatype defined in libpcap and some other functions in that library.</p><p>The development box I am using is dell vostro 1014 with ubuntu and I have libpcap running in it as I rembered myself once running the make command of libcap&nbsp; package. </p><p>But to cross compile my program I think I need the same libpcap package to be istalled in the SDK also.because when I am running the make V=99 in the SDK directory , it gives some errors regarding those variables defined in libpcap directory.</p><p>REQUIREMENT:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /> So I need to know how can I install or add packages like libpcap into the SDK.</p>									</div>
