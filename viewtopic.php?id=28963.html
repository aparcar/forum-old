					<p>Ok, I know I&#039;m being incredibly stupid but for the life of me I don&#039;t know how to update the firmware on a WAP54GV1.0. </p><p>The software that&#039;s currently in the unit does not have an administrator tab so updating firmware via the browser interface is not an option. I downloaded the full idiot guide from Cisco/Linksys but it didn&#039;t even recognize this thing. The firmware is I think the first version since it&#039;s dated 2002. I know there&#039;s a way, but after an afternoon of searching the web I can&#039;t find the clue.</p><p>I purchased the unit from my local Goodwill for the princely sum of $3.99 and it appears to be unused. I almost blew it up because all the sites say that it uses a 12v PSU. After smelling toasting components I quickly yanked it and found a 5V unit (after Googling again this time with the version number). </p><p>I understand I&#039;ve got to flash with V1.9 before V3.2 or I brick it. I know I got this thing for almost free and it&#039;s got more bugs than an anthill but if it were possible to get it going with more current software I would be very happy since I actually have a use for it. I don&#039;t need to do anything esoteric with it, I just need a moderately secure AP.</p><p>Thank you in anticipation,</p><p>Paul.</p>									</div>
