					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying custom openwrt build for my router. The last time I tried this, wireless was disabled by default. I had to connect it through lan and enable wireless through web interface. I don&#039;t have a laptop with ethernet port now. I want to enable wireless during build so that I can connect through wifi and ssh. Is it possible ?</p><p>Router: tplink 1043nd v2<br />Build:&nbsp; &nbsp;cc-15.05</p>									</div>

					<p>the way i did this once, was to make a config file for wireless that had it enabled, and included this during the build:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom_files">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#custom_files</a></p><p>an even better way is to change the firstboot scripts to enable wifi: thou i can not help you much with this as i have not done this myself: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/preinit_mount#main_firstboot_script">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/pre â€¦ oot_script</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>yoyellow</strong> on 21 Jun 2015, 19:00)</p>
