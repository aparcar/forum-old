					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p> I have jet another weird question - I need to compile an image of Kamikaze with absolute minimum software, so that the AP (ASUS WL 500gP) would only tick. I intend to remove even network drivers and use <em>PF_packet</em> interface to process the packets manually, without even sending data to kernel level. However I don&#039;t have insight in OpenWRT - could someone advise which modules during build of an image must be included? I presume it a rather short list.</p><p>Cheers,<br />tA</p>									</div>

					<p>This was actually discussed very recently on the development list:</p><p><a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.embedded.openwrt.devel/1779">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.embe â€¦ devel/1779</a></p><p>If you&#039;re going about building your own, I highly recommend starting with bleeding-edge trunk builds and centering on the August release when it comes out.&nbsp; That way, you have fewer changes to make and fewer surprises when the next (very imminent) stable release is made.</p>									</div>

					<p>7.09 is too old. It&#039;s almost a year old now. You may have more luck and help with recent trunk...</p>									</div>
