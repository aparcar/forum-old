					<p>I have just installed 4 tl wr2543nd wireless routers and 4 2.4ghz 24dbi wifi grids,house 2 and 3 are bridged together with a cat 6 network cable as you can see from the diagram,house 1-2 is connected wirelessly with wds and so is house 3-4,the wireless reaches perfect but i carnt access router one from router 4 and same with router 3,can i make these routers connect to each other so i can see all computers on the network from all 4 house&#039;s,does one of the routers have to have dhcp enabled and the others disabled? Any <br />help would be much appreciated as i dont seem to be having much look with them.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Here are some pics<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><a href="http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4918/img001ak.jpg">http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4918/img001ak.jpg</a></p><br /><p>House 1</p><br /><br /><p><a href="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/8476/grid1m.jpg">http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/8476/grid1m.jpg</a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><br /><p>House 2</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><a href="http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1766/grid2n.jpg">http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1766/grid2n.jpg</a></p><p>House 3</p><p><a href="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/7131/grid3vk.jpg">http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/7131/grid3vk.jpg</a></p><br /><p>House 4</p><p><a href="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/7123/grid4.jpg">http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/7123/grid4.jpg</a></p>									</div>
