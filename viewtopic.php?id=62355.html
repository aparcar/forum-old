					<p>that router is too weak for that kind of task, go buy yourself a prebuilt NAS or DIY it.</p><p>These days, motherboards today are freaking low power now, so there&#039;s no reason for you to make excuse about power consumption thing. I had a Supermicro motherboard with Atom Avoton SoC on clock at 2.4ghz with 2.6ghz boost and only consumes about 18watts max and idles around 5-8watts. In my case I had 8 4TB WD RED&#039;s on it with LSI raid card. Installed with FreeNAS.</p><p>Overall power consumption</p><p>idle (drives spin down) - 12watts<br />idle (drives spinning) - 23watts<br />load - 38-50watts</p><p>average power consumption 24watts</p><p>tasks, it runs basic file server, tramission, owncloud, plex etc.... it has 8 cores so yeah. Transcoding media is nothing on this Avoton 8 core atom processor, it only manage to consume 60% with 3 transcoding tasks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>remlei</strong> on 25 Jan 2016, 01:03)</p>

					<p>It might be silly questions. But, ...<br />- What&#039;s the output for swap usage when `free` runs?<br />- Did you make the swap partition in an USB storage, not in the soon-to-be-full flash memory? (IMHO, the swapping should be done blindly by the OS(linux), not by an application such as transmission or rtorrent.)<br />- You application still crashes for just seeding, if you remove all downloads, emptying the download queue?<br />- How about if you limit the peer amounts, the cache-size, ... in settings?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dzchoi</strong> on 25 Jan 2016, 09:48)</p>

I dont know why.</p><p>2 - yes I made the swap on usb (512MB).and swappiness is 60. I know about the swap being done by OS ,what I asked was if there is anyhting that needs to be done after adding swap that maybe I have forgoten in both the OS and the torrent client that makes this happen.</p><p>3- in rtorrent case that I have tested , yes.<br />it crashes as it is starting up and checking the torrents in its seeds list.<br />BTW that is one of my other questions: maybe rtorrent crashed because it tries to check the files (checksum) and it crashes on big files that need memory to do so but maybe if I add smaller files this wont happen?</p><p>4- that would be what I asked. though for rtorrent I do this anyway on laptop two (slow internet speed) though cache size in rtorrent I have not set that(can you give me the needed option?) </p><p>now my one question.<br />have you been able to do what I am trying to do?</p>									</div>
