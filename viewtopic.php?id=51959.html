					<p>I have an OpenWRT router running 12.09 r36088.</p><p>Everything has been working correctly.&nbsp; The router has OpenVPN installed so that I can access machines remotely.</p><p>I&#039;m now trying to run OpenVPN on another machine on the network behind the router.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing this so that remote phones can use their built-in OpenVPN software and connect directly.</p><p>I&#039;m using port 1194 for the router&#039;s OpenVPN and trying to use 1190 for the PBX machine.</p><p>Let&#039;s call the machines RTR (router) and PBX (raspberry pi running asterisk/freepbx and openvpn)</p><br /><p>Presently, I can log into RTR without problems.&nbsp; When I try to log into PBX, I never hit the machine (i.e. no logs are updated).&nbsp; This leads me to believe I&#039;m getting dropped at the router.</p><p>I have the following lines in firewall.user</p><p># lines for RTR&#039;s OpenVPN<br />iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -A input_wan -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT</p><p># add additional firewall accept for Raspi OpenVPN instance<br />iptables -I FORWARD 1 -d 192.168.40.210 -p tcp --dport 1190 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1190 -j DNAT --to 192.168.40.210:1190</p><br /><br /><p>Under Network - Firewall - Port Forward&#039;s in Luci, I have created this rule:</p><p>Match: IPv4-TCP, UDP<br />From any host in wan<br />Via any router IP at port 1190</p><p>Forward to: IP 192.168.40.210, port 1190 in lan</p><p>Under edit, Enable NAT loopback is ticked.</p><p>and have it enabled.&nbsp; If there is a way to do this forward in firewall.user, I&#039;ll take the &#039;line&#039; and paste it in; I just don&#039;t have a handle on all the syntax.</p><br /><p>So, I&#039;d like to have 1190 redirected to 192.168.40.210 and have it go into that VPN directly, and bypass the router.</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p><br /><p>Andrew</p>									</div>

					<p>What exactly are you doing when you &quot;try to log into PBX&quot;? Is your VPN using TCP or UDP? Why are you using firewall.user instead of normal firewall rules? Why do you have TCP on one line and UDP on the next?</p>									</div>

					<p>qasdfdsaq,</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p><p>the TCP/UDP was a cut and paste error.</p><p>I have 3 lines which should be related to port opening/forwarding to the PBX machine.</p><p>iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p udp --dport 1190 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -I FORWARD 1 -d 192.168.40.210 -p udp --dport 1190 -j ACCEPT<br />iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1190 -j DNAT --to 192.168.40.210:1190</p><p>Trying to &#039;log on&#039; means connecting via OpenVPN from a client machine.&nbsp; I can use the VPN on the router without any problems.&nbsp; I can&#039;t connect via a VPN client to the PBX machine.&nbsp; Since the PBX machine has OpenVPN logging turned on and the logs don&#039;t change (using the append command in the server.conf) it seems realistic to believe that the outside client is never getting to the PBX machine - it&#039;s either getting blocked, dropped or lost by my router (RTR).</p><p>So, I have adjusted the TCP/UDP error - thank you - but I still don&#039;t connect using the 3 lines above.</p><p>I have removed the port forwarding rule from Luci and I&#039;m using firewall.user only</p><p>What line(s) do I need to add/change in firewall.user to allow the machine at 192.168.40.210 to correctly grab client connections on port 1190 and seamlessly VPN into that machine?&nbsp; I don&#039;t care about these VPN connections being able to see any other machine on the network - just the PBX.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Andrew</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AndyInNYC</strong> on 2 Aug 2014, 02:31)</p>

					<p>I struck my head repeatedly on my desk and had a thought - perhaps the Raspberry Pi is dropping the packets, not the router.</p><p>I temporarily disabled iptables on the Pi and &#039;bang&#039; (like my head hitting the desk) the iPhone OpenVPN client connected.</p><p>Now I need a set of iptables lines to allow the VPN connection into the Pi over port 1190.</p><p>The Pi uses a different format in iptables than my firewall.user file, so I&#039;m not sure of translation.&nbsp; Additionally, I don&#039;t want/need access to the other machines on my network - just the Pi.</p><p>The Pi&#039;s iptables format reads like:</p><p>-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT<br />-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags ACK ACK -j ACCEPT<br />-A INPUT -i eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT</p><p>whereas the the firewall.user has iptables and -t or -I, etc.</p><p>Any help on what lines I need on the Pi&#039;s iptables to finish off my project?</p><p>Andrew</p>									</div>
