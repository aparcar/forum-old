					<p>Is it possible to verify how long a connection has been in place through connection tracking?</p><p>I was reading some information about NetEqualizer and it claims to be 100% effective in managing p2p connections by monitoring the total connection time rather than the ports. it claims that many p2p applications masquerade as http and ftp connections to get through firewalls and that they can be identified by the persistence time of the connection and then throttled accordingly. I know NetEqualizer is a Linux based machine, but I can&#039;t find anything in the Linux kernel (I am assuming the proc file system) that lists the total connection time. it seems that the only counters on the connnections are reset anytime traffic is handled for that connection. There appear to be no total connection time counters in the kernel by default. Any ideas?</p>									</div>
