					<p>I have installed Openwrt 10.04.1rc4 on a Asus wl 500g and i tried to run some commands during startup procedure.</p><p>I did the following:</p><p>- Set a password with passwd</p><p>First try:<br />- copy one of the scripts from /etc/init.d/ and named it /etc/init.d/startup (it was already chmod + x), the script had only the start() and stop() functions set, no boot(). I put my commands to the start script and enabled the script with /etc/init.d/startup enable.</p><p>Command did not work at startup, but runs fine if manually run after startup</p><p>Second try:<br />- I put the commands at the end of an existing startup script (/etc/init.d/boot)</p><p>Command did not work at startup, manually not tested</p><p>Third try:<br />- I put the commands into /etc/rc.local</p><p>Command did not work at startup.</p><br /><p>The same think happened with a modded Seagate Dockstar, it was flashed with an image &quot;from the internet&quot;, it is the trunk build 23xxx generation with kernel 2.6.35.9. With this image i also recognised that the /etc/fstab is cleared at startup, other thinks (/etc/config/network or /etc/passwd) are not modified at startup.</p><p>I read about the &quot;firstboot&quot; bug, but i did not know what exactly happen there...</p>									</div>
