					<p>At first Hi to All, this is my first time on this forum.</p><p>I have technical problem related to WLAN overall and to be honest i can&#039;t find better than this forum to ask about it.</p><p>As topic subject says: Random data (preferably) tool for traffic generation (ideal case with parametrization possibility) for Access Point (any brand, any SoC, available trough normal retail channels) is highly desired.</p><p>Purpose for this question is quite simple. I&#039;m involved in tests that verifying WLAN (802.11n 2.4GHz) and other 2.4GHz transmission (like Bluetooth, ZigBee etc.) interoperability. As i struggle to have particular WLAN channel occupancy (utilization) from power/time/spectrum point of view and as i don&#039;t have easy access to WLAN simulators, I&#039;m trying to replace WLAN simulator with normal AP (or combination of AP&#039;s).</p><p>In other words i&#039;m searching for software solution that can be run on modified FW AP and it have capability to occupy (transmit) particular WLAN channel (channels for 40MHz) and for example i can set remotely some parameter like channel, mode, traffic (for example as Mbps or 0 - 100%) etc.<br />All test are performed on shielded room (Faraday chamber thus no problem with pollution open space).<br />Currently i&#039;m using ZAP form Ruckus (and zperf based on ZAP) however there some combination&#039;s for channels (like two 40 MHz non overlap) where overall spectrum utilization is relatively low as devices frequently drops to 20MHz mode.</p><p>Thank You in Advance.</p>									</div>
