					<p>What I Have (and like):<br />- Windows XP running Winamp<br />- Netgear WGT634U with USB Audio (C-Media) running MPD on Kamikaze r3587</p><p>What I Want:<br />- One-to-one audio streaming from Winamp to Kamikaze</p><p>I&#039;ve been using Winamp&#039;s Shoutcast Source plugin, streaming to a server on *third* computer running the Shoutcast server and streaming to MPD.&nbsp; It works, but it&#039;s awkward - in the first place, it&#039;s designed for multicasting (overkill for my setup), plus there&#039;s a big time lag between hitting Start on Winamp and having any sound come out of MPD (same for &quot;Stop&quot; and silence).</p><p>I *don&#039;t* want to store MP3 files on the Kamikaze box, not locally nor via NFS or Samba.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried that, and it tends to overwhelm the Kamikaze box - those reboots which come in the middle of a song are quite discouraging!</p><p>Winamp has a plugin which will stream to an AirPort (&quot;Remote Speakers output&quot;), and that looks like exactly what I want for a music source... but what can I run on Kamikaze as a receiver which will send that output to my audio device?&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at mt-daapd, but that seems to be a *client* which sends audio to an Apple AirPort *server* - that&#039;s the opposite of what I want.</p><p>I have a feeling that someone out there must have already solved this problem, and that I&#039;m just not looking in the right place.&nbsp; Help, help!&nbsp; I just want my toys to play together nicely!</p>									</div>

					<p>you could try esd. that daemon works pretty well for me on my asus wl-500g (streaming from linux to the asus). it seems that there is also a winamp-plugin available to output to esd, just do a websearch. </p><p>greetings, <br />andy</p>									</div>

					<p>wombat - Thank you, I&#039;ve seen those threads (9963 and 8138).&nbsp; They solve a problem I don&#039;t have (MPD works great on my machine, I&#039;m listing to music right now!) but don&#039;t address the problem I posted.</p><p>mauritzius - Ooh, esd (EsounD) looks good! (*short pause while I give it a try*) Hmm, it&#039;s good, but it occasionally pauses, sometimes for a fraction of a second and sometimes for longer.&nbsp; Drat, I wonder where the problem is?&nbsp; Anyway, just for reference...<br />INFO: <a href="http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=4150">http://wl500g.info/showthread.php?t=4150</a><br />ESD BINARY: <a href="http://home.in.tum.de/%7Epustka/mipsel/esd">http://home.in.tum.de/%7Epustka/mipsel/esd</a><br />WINAMP PLUGIN: <a href="http://www.linuxfan.dk/index.php?page=code">http://www.linuxfan.dk/index.php?page=code</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Your original approach is correct, you just need some tweaks to get mpd to work nicely.&nbsp; Check out this website: <a href="http://devices.natetrue.com/musicap/">http://devices.natetrue.com/musicap/</a></p><p>There are some suggestions/startup commands to help reduce or eliminate the sound problems you are experiencing. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been able to totally eliminate it myself, but i have heard others have been able to.&nbsp; I guess it depends on the card you&#039;re using and maybe the build, not sure.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the command from that link above...</p><p>#This line reduces latency for pause and setvol commands<br />echo mpd 5 16384 &gt; /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss</p><p>I can&#039;t remembe rwhat all of the parameters do, but it sort of works.&nbsp; Be sure the /proc path is valid <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I use esound-oss (not enough space for alsa left) on my WL-500g and stream MPD from my server (that holds the MP3 archive) via ESD to the Asus. That works flawlessly, without any skips or any other sound problems. there is a delay of under a second between hitting play and the music coming out.<br />I also run MPD locally on the Asus to listen to Internet-Radio. The stream is also perfect (at least up to 160kbps), but when switching stations there are some pauses, I don&#039;t really care about them as they happen just at the beginning.<br />In fact I&#039;m totally impressed how well this small device performs: Given the fact that the Asus has just a 125MHz-CPU, the possibilities are gigantic!</p>									</div>
