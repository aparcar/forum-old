					<p>Hi there,</p><p>A couple o&#039; days ago I saw that openwrt is finally available for my trusty router! So I&#039;ve downloaded the latest backfire for it and flashed it through hhtp.<br />Everything went fine, and I had access through luci only thing was the printer (usb) and internet connection leds&nbsp; were constantly &quot;on&quot;. I tried to setup wan connection with no success.<br />Thinking something was corrupted with the .bin I had downloaded, I downloaded the file again and re-flashed the router through luci. But out of mistake, I had downloaded a &quot;trunk&quot; version, not a &quot;backfire&quot;. The result is I can connect to the router via SSH (using Putty) but nothing else. I must somehow either give internet connectivity to the machine in order to install luci or re-flash it with a &quot;backfire&quot; version, but I can&#039;t figure out how!</p><p>Can anybody help?</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for your response...</p><p>As far as I read I should probably first set up the ports of the router so it understands where the wan is and after that try to connect to the internet...<br />As stated here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/us.robotics/usr9108">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/us.robotics/usr9108</a>, there are three interfaces:</p><p><strong>br-lan (lan and wifi)</strong>, <strong>eth0 (lan ports 1-4)</strong> and <strong>wlan0 (wifi but disabled)</strong></p><p>seeing the routers &quot;network&quot; file in /etc/config/, network settings are under <strong>&quot;eth1&quot;</strong> and wan settings are under <strong>&quot;eth0&quot;</strong>. I have the feeling this is wrong.</p><p>By the way, my connection is ADSL</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>myron</strong> on 19 Aug 2012, 10:04)</p>

					<p>Hi again!<br />If things weren&#039;t bad enough, I thought to make them worst!</p><p>I edited the /etc/config/network file trying to give some internet connectivity to the router by making it&nbsp; a part of the rest of the network. Along with ip address and gateway I also&nbsp; edited the &quot;eth1&quot; to &quot;eth0&quot; and deleted the wan record.</p><p>Result: I lost also SSH connectivity! For a second after restart the router seems to get an ip and responds to pings but after that its unreachable.<br />I tried to put it in failsafe mode by continuously hitting the reset button for over a minute but the reaction I get is that as long I hit the button the power led, the lan leds and the DSL led are ON and the router is not pingable. When I stop, it does respond to 3-pings and then gets unreachable again....</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>myron</strong> on 21 Aug 2012, 00:02)</p>
