					<p>I agree that such a column would be useful, but it would have to be much more than a simple &quot;Yes/No&quot; checkbox. For example, it would need to be able to contain such notes as &quot;Discontinued, but often available on eBay.&quot;</p>									</div>

					<p>Good idea.&nbsp; It would probably be easiest for each person to add what he knows to be true, so one person could add &#039;Discontinued 2006-11&#039; and somebody else could add &#039;available on eBay&#039; as both are useful bits of information atomically, though even better together.</p><p>Since yesterday I also found that it would be really helpful to have a spectrum column for a/b/g/n.&nbsp; Sometimes this is tucked in to a model column, often I have to read through details.&nbsp; Finding a current Kamikaze 802.11a radio is currently a hard exercise and this would help quite a bit.</p>									</div>

					<p>cheers great idea considering i&#039;ve been trying to help a friend get an openwrt compatible router... its not fun/easy one of the best bets is like a Wrt54GL but i hate its 1/2 memories compared to the first G&#039;s and GS&#039;s though searching newegg for &quot;open router&quot; brought some interesting results</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it would be great to have the TOH in a queryable database, so one could find a model for one&#039;s needs much more easily (e.g. must have usb and miniPCI and RAM &gt; 16, or 11n and supported in kamikaze).<br />Then it would also possible to add routers which will never be supported (e.g. because of too less ram, or not based on linux and no support for the platform) to the database without cluttering it (and that might help to answer some &quot;does this router run openwrt&quot; questions).</p>									</div>
