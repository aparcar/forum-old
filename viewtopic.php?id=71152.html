					<p>I&#039;m using OpenWrt with the Mediatek7688. </p><p>I have a problem with the routing table, which it seems to not update properly. I&#039;m connecting it as STA to my home router or to my iPhone and sometimes the routing table doesn&#039;t get updated with the new config (ie: there no default gateway, no other route). But also, sometimes, the old routing table remains there even the wifi STA connection gets disconnected. </p><p>Therefore, my questions are:<br />1. who is responsible to update the routing table?<br />2. how I can manually invoke to &quot;refresh&quot; the routing table when the wifi gets connected or disconnected?</p><p>I&#039;m using kernel 3.18.45, CC.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Cezane.</p>									</div>
