					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;ve got two ASUS Wl-500gP and I want to connect them in wds mode. I followed your howto, built openwrt form trunk r11993, flashed both routers. The wds link with psk2 is working, but:<br />the first router is connected to an adsl wired router through the wan port. I can only get internet access while I&#039;m connected to the first router. I cannot connect to the internet while I&#039;m connected to the second router (the wds link between them is working).</p><p>About all of the connections:<br />adsl router&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; --&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ASUS Wl-500gP (AP1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;----&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ASUS Wl-500gP (AP2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; --&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;computer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wan port&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wds&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lan or wifi<br />10.0.0.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lan: ip 192.168.1.1 (static)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lan: ip 192.168.1.2 (static)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mask 255.255.255.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mask 255.255.255.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wan: ip 10.0.0.10 (dhcp)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;gateway 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mask 255.0.0.0 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gateway 255.0.0.0</p><p>With these settings I can ping the adsl router at address 10.0.0.2 from AP2, but I cant get internet access. i couldn&#039;t ping 10.0.0.2 from AP2 without adding gateway 192.168.1.1 on lan ip settings.</p><p>I couldn&#039;t get the internet connection so I&#039;ve installed dd-wrt. Configured the wds link and I&#039;ve got the internet connection on booth of them via cable or wifi.</p><br /><p>on dd-wrt wds link works flawlessly.</p><p>On openwrt still no internet connection... Firewall has to be enabled on AP1 (else no ping to the internet while connected to AP1) - maybe its something with firewall settings??</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>matt1606</strong> on 29 Jul 2008, 23:16)</p>
