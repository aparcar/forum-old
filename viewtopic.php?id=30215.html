					<p>This is my first question ever, on any forum. Most solutions are out there.&nbsp; I hope that this one is not too dumb.<br />I have been using OpenWRT for many years.&nbsp; It is a great piece of work, and I greatly appreciate all of the work done by the developers.&nbsp; Now, I want to try something different.</p><p>What I would like to do is have selected programs on my LAN connect to the internet through a VPN.&nbsp; I currently have PPTP set up on a Windows PC, however all programs then use the VPN.</p><p>I would like to set up PPTP on my WRT54GL with White Russian or Kamikaze to allow only some programs on different PCs to connect through it.&nbsp; It is my understanding that if I set-up a PPTP VPN on the WRT54GL, all traffic from my LAN will go through it. Is this correct?</p><p>So, I thought that I could set up a SOCKS server, srelay I guess, and have only the SOCKS server direct traffic through the PPTP VPN, and have all other traffic go out the usual way, directly to the internet.&nbsp; I have had a look for info on srelay and PPTP and I see that setting up either one is not too hard.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t yet know enough to do something non-standard.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know if I am asking the right question.</p><p>My questions are:<br />1. Is it possible to have a SOCKS server direct traffic through a PPTP VPN and continue to have other traffic go out directly through my ISP?<br />2. If not, is there anything else that I should look at, that would achieve the same goal?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any answers offered.</p>									</div>
