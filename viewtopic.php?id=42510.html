					<p>Hi there,<br />I am trying to compile a new image with the make command.<br />However it failed so I tried: make V=s<br />This still gived me the following error:<br />--2013-02-24 18:00:28--&nbsp; (try: 4)&nbsp; <a href="http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/libubox-2013-01-29-0bc317aa4d9af44806c28ca286d79a8b5a92b2b8.tar.gz">http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/libu â€¦ 2b8.tar.gz</a><br />Connecting to mirror2.openwrt.org|46.4.11.11|:80... failed: Connection timed out.<br />Retrying.</p><p>After trying to connect to mirror2.openwrt.org it seemed it timed out.<br />So I gues it has to do with the website as it is down.</p><p>Does somebody know of a workaround like downloading the file from a different location and put it in a certain folder so the make command can find it? And does somebody know when this site will be up again?</p><p>Hopefully someone can assist me with a workaround or something.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dre2007</strong> on 24 Feb 2013, 19:28)</p>
