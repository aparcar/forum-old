					<p>We have a router that can run OpenWRT: a Western Digital My Net N750 router.</p><p>wiki.openwrt&lt;dot&gt;org/toh/wd/n750<br />I was told that OpenWRT can help me with my goal.</p><p>First, some background:<br />Three people will share one internet service. Their internet service is not unlimited. It is metered and pricey.<br />Amy will have just one laptop.<br />Britney will have a laptop and smartphone.<br />Courtney will have a Linux Mint desktop, a Linux Mint laptop, an Android tablet and an Android phone.</p><p>Most likely, all will be connecting via WiFi (as opposed to ethernet cable).</p><p>What is needed to see how much each person has used per month (i.e., billing cycle)?</p><p>Ideally, each person has her own login username and password.<br />Ideally, each person can check her own usage for the month by going to some IP address to see their current usage. (The admin would have access to everyoneâ€™s bandwidth/network info.)<br />It would also be nice if there was a way to cap usage for a certain person, or when the group hits X gigabytes. (Because there may be overage fees.)</p><p>No one will not game, netflix, torrent.</p><br /><br /><p>------</p><p>Please advise what I must do to get these features. I hope that the page that displays bandwidth used will be user-friendly, for the other people I&#039;m sharing the internet with. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

I have it on one of my n750s. To get the rite file go to this page: <a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/download.php">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/download.php</a><br />Down load this file gargoyle_1.9.2-ar71xx-generic-mynet-n750-squashfs-factory.bin<br />Don&#039;t worry about bricking your router the n750 can not be bricked :-) Just follow the instructions from the link you posted for flashing OpenWRT.

					<p>There are a number of options to monitor bandwidth.&nbsp; One of the lightest ones is vnstat - the output is illustrated here: <a href="http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/openbsd-router#stats">http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/openbsd-router#stats</a></p><p>There is also a wiki entry for openwrt on bandwidth monitoring.&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/bwmon">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/bwmon</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 7 Mar 2017, 20:29)</p>

					<p>Hi there is bandwidth charts for out going and incoming trafic. You can filter for your hole connection or by client. You can see the data used for 15 mins 1 hour, 1 day or a hole month. You can set quotas so you can&#039;t go over your data cap. There is more about this in the Documentation:<br /><a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php</a><br />If your asking how it does it I am not sure. I do know that some of the things are hooked in to the kernel That is why Gargoyle is only built on top of a stable release of OpenWRT.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tapper</strong> on 8 Mar 2017, 22:22)</p>
