Early models also contained a SD Card slot. The system was shipped running OpenWRT 15 - Chaos Calmer, with customizations that create a security device capable of running OpenVPN, E2Guardian, Snort, Squid, Suricata, StrongSwan and other internet security applications. The system has an external slider switch to select from different operating modes: Router, Bridge or Gateway. As of this writing, the current firmware is v1.51 SP1.</p><p>Following are a few of the documents provided by Itus after the Shield was launched:</p><p>Shield Pro Administrator&#039;s Guide: <a href="http://1drv.ms/20eDDZh">http://1drv.ms/20eDDZh</a></p><p>Shield Pro Quick Start Guide: <a href="http://1drv.ms/20eDOnk">http://1drv.ms/20eDOnk</a></p><p>Shield Pro SSL VPN Dynamic DNS Setup Guide: <a href="http://1drv.ms/20eDV2a">http://1drv.ms/20eDV2a</a></p><p>Original 1.51 SP1 firmware Install script: <a href="http://1drv.ms/1Vy8Tvs">http://1drv.ms/1Vy8Tvs</a><br />(this file is the original firmware install script provided by Itus.

					<p>Hi all -- I just joined. I&#039;m really sad to hear about Itus going under. Great people and a great product idea. And now I&#039;m having technical issues with my shield and cannot solve them on my own after many hours trying. I searched and didn&#039;t see a good place to post problems on this forum for possible help. Forgive my ignorance if I&#039;m posting in the wrong place.</p><p>My shield (router mode) stopped working two days ago. No reason, just stopped. I tried all the suggestions in other forum posts about rebooting, resetting, restarting my modem, router, and shield. No dice. Tested cables too, and not the problem. Waited the prescribed timeframes for each bootup, including 15 min for Shield</p><p>When modem is connected to router without Shield between, everything works great. So problem is isolated to the Shield. </p><p>Lights are on, so the Shield appears to be working, and I can access its admin interface. But I can never get the internet connected with Shield in place. So obviously something is wrong</p><p>I&#039;m very appreciative of any troubleshooting suggestions you can provide</p><p>However, if Itus is no longer, will Shield still get regular 3rd party updates (similar to virus definition updates)? If the current ones will become obsolete, and I cannot get new updates, is there a point in resurrecting my shield (?)</p><p>thanks for your insights and kind regards,<br />-Rob</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Mazilo,</p><p>Thank you for that kind welcome!!</p><p>Yep, it is a nice piece of hardware and the software is doing what it should. Yes, it has some minor things that haven&#039;t gotten worked out, but as a community we may be able to get it fixed.</p><p>Re budget, I&#039;d keep an eye on eBay (and I *am* keeping one on it!) for people selling because they don&#039;t want to put in the effort to keep it going or can&#039;t wrap their heads around it. There are already one or two out there (at usury prices!) trying to sell before word gets widespread about Itus&#039; plight. But there will be more that should be at reasonable asking price.</p><p>For me, I considered running Snort in my Asus router, but felt with a family of 4 and a 125mb pipe, it wouldn&#039;t handle the throughput. So this is a great solution.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wisiwyg</strong> on 31 Jan 2016, 01:58)</p>

And now I&#039;m having technical issues with my shield and cannot solve them on my own after many hours trying. I searched and didn&#039;t see a good place to post problems on this forum for possible help. Forgive my ignorance if I&#039;m posting in the wrong place.</p><p>My shield (router mode) stopped working two days ago. No reason, just stopped.

So problem is isolated to the Shield. </p><p>Lights are on, so the Shield appears to be working, and I can access its admin interface. But I can never get the internet connected with Shield in place. So obviously something is wrong</p><p>I&#039;m very appreciative of any troubleshooting suggestions you can provide</p><p>However, if Itus is no longer, will Shield still get regular 3rd party updates (similar to virus definition updates)? If the current ones will become obsolete, and I cannot get new updates, is there a point in resurrecting my shield (?)</p><p>thanks for your insights and kind regards,<br />-Rob</p></blockquote></div><p>Hi Rob!</p><p>Firstly, yes, if you&#039;re on 1.51 with the latest fw_upgrade script then Shield will continue to get updates for malicious sites for IPS rules. These are being pulled from rules.emergeingthreats.net, an open source Snort rules provider, with the rules being updated daily at emergingthreats. So yes, I&#039;d recommend resurrecting your Shield! </p><p>What you described sounds like Snort is not starting. In Router Mode, Shield will still pass internet if Snort doesn&#039;t start - traffic just won&#039;t get filtered. In Bridge mode, traffic is passed through Snort like a soft switch. The fact that you&#039;re getting into the interface through the .111 interface, but no traffic is what points me to a Snort problem.</p><p>Try going into the Status, System Log file from the LuCI interface and scroll to the bottom. You&#039;re looking for FATAL ERROR, something like the problem described below...</p><br /><p>After the upgrade, the system was not connecting. Searching through the logs I found this:</p><p>Sun Jan 24 10:01:38 2016 daemon.notice snort[10282]: WARNING: /etc/snort/rules/snort.rules(4349) GID 1 SID 2404000 in rule duplicates previous rule.

Then this:</p><p>Sun Jan 24 10:09:38 2016 daemon.notice snort[10989]: WARNING: /etc/snort/rules/snort.rules(4350) GID 1 SID 2404001 in rule duplicates previous rule.

While the log indicates the earlier (old) rule is ignored, it looks like it still causes a fatal exception preventing snort from starting.</p><p>Is there a backup of the snort rules stored on the system that I can replace the corrupt file with? Or, is the snort.rules file available for download alone? I don&#039;t want to go through this exercise of finding one, commenting out, restarting, to see if there&#039;s another one duplicated. It might be as simple as going to the first duplicate instance and deleting everything beneath it.</p><p>Also, the script goes to rules.emergingthreats.net to dl update files. That site is blocked by Norton connectsafe, which is running as a DNS filter on my router. Shield would never get to the site to dl a new ruleset.</p><p>Further update....</p><p>I walked through the snort.rules file and found where it looked like the original fileset had duplicated itself on top. I selected what appeared to be the duplicates and deleted them from the file, effectively the top half of the file&#039;s data.</p><p>I then went to the router and cleared rules.emergingthreats.net to allow it to pass the DNS filter - basically changed filter providers to Yandex and then navigated to rules.emergingthreats.net to ensure it would pass.</p><p>I then restarted Snort. Everything came back up and I had internet access.</p><p>I then SSH&#039;d into Shield and manually kicked off fw_upgrade. Everything processed, the system log didn&#039;t list a fatal exception. It appears to be running as expected now, except I still received a couple of errors on the script:</p><p>rm: can&#039;t remove &#039;/tmp/ads.tmp&#039; : No such file or directory<br />rm: can&#039;t remove &#039;/tmp/malicious.tmp&#039; : No such file or directory</p><p>Even though it works fine with those errors, I would expect those to exist as I looked through the script and it tries to pull rules for them. I haven&#039;t looked at the server to confirm that there are or are not rules available for the script to pull to create those files, though. But for now, I have internet running through Shield again.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Wisiwyg</strong> on 31 Jan 2016, 02:27)</p>

					<p>Regarding the information above, I also received a request to provide a walk-through the steps covered in the forensic review. </p><p>Disclaimer: I&#039;m not a Snort expert or an IT specialist... I dabble at this for &quot;fun with a purpose&quot;.</p><p>Prerequisite: Shield is running in Bridge mode, in place with output from modem on eth0, cable from eth1 to your network, cable from eth2 to the WAN port on your router. Shield is powered up, even though you&#039;re not getting internet. Basically, have it all set up as it should work normally.</p><p>Identify Snort Problem<br />1) In LuCI, open the System Log at Status/System Log<br />2) Use the browser&#039;s search function and look for &quot;FATAL ERROR&quot;. In Firefox it is Ctrl-F.<br />3) If Fatal Error is found, look at the log to determine whether it occurs in the Snort start-up sequence. It should look like this:<br />Sun Jan 24 10:01:38 2016 daemon.err snort[10282]: FATAL ERROR: /etc/snort/rules/snort.rules(4349) threshold (in rule): could not create threshold - only one per sig_id=2404000</p><p>Problem Found<br />4) Using WinSCP, open Shield, navigate to /etc/snort/rules and highlight snort.rules. Right click and choose Duplicate and give it a .bak extension. Keep this backup- just in case...<br />5) In WinSCP still, right click on snort.rules and choose Edit. The file will open and present you with a screen full of text. Make sure your cursor is at the top, left of the text.<br />6) In WinSCP, press Ctrl-F for Find/Search. Enter the duplicate rule number from step 3 above that generated the Fatal Error. In this case, it is 2404000.<br />7) Search for the duplicate. Note the Search has an Up and Down function. Once you find the rule once, Search again from that location. If the rule is found a 2nd time (which it should), highlight the line above the 2nd instance and select all of the text back to the top. Delete the highlighted text, leaving the line with the 2nd instance as the 1st line in the resulting list.<br />8) Save the snort.rules list and exit WinSCP.<br />9) Reboot, give about 10 minutes for everything to start and internet to come up. If internet doesn&#039;t come up, go through the process steps 1-9 above again, eliminating duplicates in the snort.rules file.</p><p>It is probably OK to actually delete everything in the rules file except 1 or 2 lines. The purpose of this is to get Snort to come up. In Bridge mode, Snort is in control of internet pass-through. If it doesn&#039;t come up properly, internet doesn&#039;t pass. Router mode is different. I believe internet will pass, but Snort won&#039;t examine traffic. I&#039;m not sure as I don&#039;t run in Router mode and have had no experience with it. By wiping everything but 1 or 2 lines, Snort would come up and the whole rules file would be rebuilt after the fw_upgrade script runs.</p><p>Other issue?<br />9) Once internet function is back, open rules.emergingthreats.net in your browser. If you are successful, then the script can get to the location for nearly all of the snort updates. If not, as in my case, you will need to figure out why that site is being blocked. In my case, my Asus router has DNS filter functions that prevented connection. By going there manually, I could see the block message from the router.&nbsp; </p><p>Finally<br />10) There are additional functions in the nightly script that update the ads and malicious website filters used for the web filter functions. While they don&#039;t appear to break Snort, you may want to make sure the sites are available for that function as well. Those sites are listed at the bottom of the fw_upgrade script. Using the steps 4 and 5 above, open /sbin/fw_upgrade with WinSCP in Edit mode. Scroll to the bottom and look through the ####Ads Update#### and ####Malware Update#### sections. Try each of those websites in your browser. If any of them are blocked for some reason, you can either put a &#039;#&#039; in the first position on the line to comment it out or ferret out the reason they&#039;re being blocked. You don&#039;t have to do this to get Snort to run and get internet back online.</p><p>Update Rules<br />11) Using SSH, log into Shield and manually start the software update by issuing the command &quot;sh /sbin/fw_upgrade&quot;. Alternatively, use the built-in LuCI function at Status/Itus Settings/Update Shield to start the upgrade process. It will take about 3-5 minutes to run the update.</p><p>Note that WinSCP has a &#039;terminal&#039; icon that you can click to get a terminal into Shield, but it does not support multiple steps. So, don&#039;t use the WinSCP terminal to run the script. There is another icon in WinSCP that will open an instance of PuTTy. If you set this up, then you *can* use the Open PuTTy icon in WinSCP to run the script.</p><p>Hope this helps....</p>									</div>
