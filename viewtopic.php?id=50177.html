					<p>Hi All,<br />I have an Avalon 2 with OpenWRT mining with CGminer.<br />I also have 38gh BE Cube(ethernet) and a BFL Jalkapeno(USB)<br />I want point my BE Cube miner to the CGminer on the Avalon so I don&#039;t need to have a proxy server/BFGminer running on a separate computer</p><p>On my computer I have BFGminer running and I am able to point the BE Cube to the ip address(of computer) and the BFGminer will add a device called PXY0. That works fine (this is instead of running proxy server software)</p><p>Avalon:<br />TP-LINK TL-WR703N v1<br />OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r38816 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r9934)<br />3.10.18<br />cgminer 3.9.0-1<br />IP 192.168.1.254</p><p>tried pointing the Cube to 192.168.1.254:3333 - will not mine, switches to pool (B)<br />tried to install BFGminer on openWRT - do not have enough space free (56k left) ( I am guessing that when I did the opkg install command some stuff was downloaded)<br />tried to add a USB HUb &amp; Stick&nbsp; - preFormated w/ext2 - device does not appear in /dev<br />tried to add any dependencies&nbsp; (Kmod-USB2 etc as per wiki) I get this error:<br /> satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for kmod-usb-storage:<br /> *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kernel (= 3.10.36-1-af8baec28992320f4130655ccee78bbb) *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kernel (= 3.10.36-1-af8baec28992320f4130655ccee78bbb) *</p><p>My goal here is to have the openWRT on the Avalon run all my mining equipment so I don&#039;t have to have a separate computer running at the same time (tried RapPi - not able to handle the speed of the BE Cube under&nbsp; BFGminer - results in lower GHs) </p><p>I have scoured the internet but can find a solution to my 3 problems, as each solution is thwarted by one of the&nbsp; problems I have listed</p><p>can this be done??</p><p>if I need to reflash OpenWRT - please be specific as I have never done that.</p><p>Thanks for help</p>									</div>
