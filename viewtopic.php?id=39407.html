					<p>Last day I bricked my 740nv4 by upgrading openwrt.<br />The sysupgrade command went ok, but in the end it didn&#039;t reboot, and the router was totally freezed.<br />After 10 minutes, I rebooted it, and it was bricked in a u-boot loop due a corrupted flash image.</p><p>The big problem was that I hadn&#039;t any usb-serial adapter (it burned, it was from ebay, cheap quality... ), and my laptop (logically) doesn&#039;t have serial port, so I had to get the car and do a 20minute travel to my parents&#039;s house, just for fixing the router in my PC, 2 minutes with 3 u-boot commands.</p><p>Due this, I thought how to do fix it next time without having to buy another serial converter, or go back home.<br />After a bit of brainstorming, I came with the idea of using a small PIC, connecting it to the serial header and powering from it.</p><p>Its role is to parse the serial output of the console, and put the recovery commands.<br />The hardware is really small and cheap: a PIC12F1822. Small, but can run at 32MHz (8MIPS).Had it free from Microchip samples <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />.</p><p>And almost nothing else is needed, just a small capacitor for giving a stable voltage to the pic, and the female header to connect it to the router.<br />This are the parsing strings it does search, and what it do after it find them:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>&quot;Autobooting in 1 seconds&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; Put &quot;tpl&quot; to enter the command line.

Parse and save the &quot;ssssss&quot; (firmware size) for the erase command. Wait for &quot;hornet&gt;&quot;<br />&quot;hornet&gt;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; Put &quot;erase 0x9f020000 +0xssssss&quot;<br />&quot;Erased nn sectors&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; OK, erase finished.

Stop and do nothing!</p></blockquote></div><p>And a small image of how it would be if I had done it in a good way:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img546/5197/picuboot.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/a/img546/5197/picuboot.jpg" /></span><br />The truth is that I will bend the pins and solder everything together without PCB, the dirty cheap way <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" /></p><p>As u-boot is used in lots of routers, and the syntax is the same, this little thing could be useful for them all.</p><p>You only need to configure your computer LAN IP (usually 192.168.1.100) and start your TFTP server with the &quot;firmware.bin&quot; file.<br />Then plug the PIC-Recovery (for calling it something) and power the router. 15 seconds later it will reboot and done!</p><br /><p>Now the funny story is that I got the chips, the soldering iron and everything else at my parents&#039;s house, so I will have to go there again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />.<br />For now, I have simulated it and it works like a charm<br />If anybody likes this and want to do it himself, let me know and I will send the hex / source files (in C, Hi-Tech compiler). <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 17 Sep 2012, 15:55)</p>

					<p>Sorry if offended you, it wasn&#039;t my intention.<br /> I don&#039;t say that all chinese products&nbsp; are bad quality. But 95% from ebay...yes.<br />Buy a led lamp, its says 9w but is will be 3. <br />Buy a charger that says it can ouput 3Amps but it will only 1 and get hot.<br />Buy a battery that claims to be 1800mah and will be 1200...<br />Almost everything is fake.<br />A seller said to me that even the factory tricked him, giving a real 9w led for testing, but 3w when he bought 500 for selling in ebay.<br />Of course, I&#039;m sure that there are honest sellers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 17 Sep 2012, 15:56)</p>
