					<p>I&#039;m having speed issues on Freifunk Firmware. Let me explain you - my network setup like this: </p><p>net &lt;-&gt; adsl router (static ip: 192.168.1.254) with DHCP server enabled (192.168.1.x) &lt;-&gt; WRT54g with Freifunk Firmware (FF) via LAN #1 port (static ip: 192.168.1.1), wireless ip same as LAN #1 (192.168.1.1) and olsr routes: 192.168.1.0/30. I don&#039;t use WAN port because that WAN didn&#039;t get DHCP from adsl router. I tried to set WAN port on static ip (192.168.1.1) but it didn&#039;t work, so I changed back to LAN #1.</p><p>Then I tested desktop computer hooked up with FF box via LAN #2 port and able to get ip address from adsl router quickly, no problem. Desktop computer able to access the net and get higher speeds (via speed test sites) no problem.</p><p>When I tested laptop computer with Wifi card, it able to connect to FF box and get DHCP from adsl router, able to access the net - no problem at all. But.... when I put that laptop on speed tests,&nbsp; the download speeds are less than 80kbps AND upload speeds are much higher than that! </p><p>Methink this speed issues have something to do with S45firewall script and LAN &amp; WAN. I&#039;ve been trying to figure out what rules to change. Do I have to break the br0?&nbsp; Anyone have updated their S45firewall or other S scripts on their FF boxes to improve the WiFi speeds via LAN instead of WAN?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Interesting note: </p><p>As the same network setup above, the WLAN mode on FF box is: Ad-Hoc (peer to peer). If I change from Ad-Hoc to Master Access Point mode, then the download speeds on laptop with wifi card increased.</p><p>The Ad-Hoc mode is limiting download speeds under 80kbps on laptop with WiFi card mostly.</p><p>Suggestions? Ideas?</p>									</div>
