					<p>I was able to install redboot and backfire (the ixp4xx images) on my Actiontec MI424-WR rev D following Jose&#039;s instructions here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/mi424wr">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/actiontec/mi424wr</a>&nbsp; but I have a few problems and questions.</p><p>1. Due to the difference in the rev D hardware, I only see an eth0 interface that corresponds to the WAN port. The original system (before I flashed it with openwrt) had a br0 interface for the LAN and an ixp1 interface for the WAN. Does anyone know how I can get access to the LAN interface?</p><p>2. I can&#039;t send short pings, as described in this issue: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7228">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7228</a><br />but &quot;ping -s64&quot; (or -s57 for that matter) works OK.&nbsp; That ticket says the issue is resolved (in trunk?)&nbsp; Do I need to compile my own image to fix it?</p><p>3. Is it safe to use the luci firmware upgrade process from now on, or do I have to go through the redboot procedure, recreating the flash partitions etc.?</p><p>4. I removed kmod-madwifi and installed kmod-ath5k instead.&nbsp; The interface wlan0 is shown by ifconfig,&nbsp; I can bring it up with the &quot;wifi&quot; script, and other stations can see its SSID and associate with it.&nbsp; But dnsmasq complains &quot;warning: interface wlan0 does not currently exist&quot;, so I can&#039;t do any DHCP etc.</p><p>Any help or pointers would be very welcome.</p>									</div>
