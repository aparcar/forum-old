					<p>I would like to see openwrt offer a WAN Accelerator to help WAN Speed Improvements. I use the VPN but with Very High Latancy Connections the speed downloads are bad from a VPN connection and i can not stream video or audio from my home PC&#039;s.</p><p>I use a WNDR3700V2 but if to improve this we need to move to better hardware with a more powerful CPU than that would be fine and then we could make our Routers more of a switch and Wireless AP that would pass all WAN traffic through the PC based Router</p><br /><p>This is something that is very lacking in the community and could be a big improvement over very expensive WAN Accelerators.</p><p>This is really needed for anyone that travels and uses any type of VPN connection.</p><p>OpenWRT has been good but there should really be a full packaged product option also that will give someone something that could do everything. I know there is pfsense but why use that is openwrt could provide all the same options plus a WAN accelerator.</p>									</div>
