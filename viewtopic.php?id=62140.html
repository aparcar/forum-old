					<p>Hi,</p><p>Just found out about OpenWrt and would love to try it on my old BT HomeHub 2b. I&#039;ve found the instructions and I understand most of what is required, but I&#039;ve fallen at almost the first hurdle. I&#039;ve made the USB stick to use to do the initial unlock to gain access to ssh, the router won&#039;t let me explore the contents of the USB stick to move the files around as required. I am told that I don&#039;t have permission to view the sys folder.</p><p>The steps that I&#039;m following are taken from <a href="http://openwrt.ebilan.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=6">http://openwrt.ebilan.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=6</a></p><p>I&#039;ve opened the instructions and have done everything up to...<br />---<br />1.4: Double click usb1 and select the utelnetd and the smb.conf files, then select edit &gt;&gt; copy<br />1.5: Double click the SYS folder and then the ETC folder<br />---<br />1.4 works fine, but 1.5 says permission denied on the first click.</p><p>a. The router is a BT Home Hub 2.0 (V 2.0 Type B)<br />b. I&#039;m using Windows 10 Pro 64bit.<br />c. I&#039;m connected over wifi and opened the drive having logged in with Admin.<br />d. I&#039;ve tried changing the permissions, but it doesn&#039;t like that.<br />e. I&#039;m fairly technical and use Ubuntu mainly, but Windows when I have to.</p><p>What am I doing wrong? Any ideas?</p><p>Martin</p>									</div>
