					<p>The NAND I have on RB450G reports as NAND device: Manufacturer ID: 0xad, Chip ID: 0xd3 (Hynix NAND 1GiB 3,3V 8-bit).<br />The partitioning is not read from the device nor the bootloader, it is specified in the kernel driver, under drivers/mtd/nand/rb4xx_nand.c<br />My partition table is<br />0x000000000000-0x000000040000 : &quot;booter&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />0x000000040000-0x000000a00000 : &quot;kernel&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />0x000000a00000-0x000040000000 : &quot;rootfs&quot;&nbsp; <br />Thus, the kernel has 10MB and rootfs has 128MB, the rest of the flash is not used. (I don&#039;t need the space yet, as I use the NFS as rootfs)</p><p>However, I also do have problems with loading kernels larger than about 3.5 MB, not sure why ... but I am building &amp; trimming the ELF image with a custom script, so there might be a problem in there.</p><p>I also went thru the setup code for the Ubiquity RS Pro and Dlink 825 which seem to use the same PHY (AR8316), but haven&#039;t found anything special (I believe that each manufacturer connects the switch at whichever processor interface port he likes). </p><p>KanjiMonster posted a wiring of the ports at AR8316 that I am assuming is correct:<br />* Port 5 directly wired to WAN on eth0.<br />* Ports 2-4 are LAN3-1 (i.e., LAN1 is Port 4, LAN2 is 3 and LAN1 is 2).<br />* Port 1 isn&#039;t connected anywhere<br />* Port 0 is the CPU port and connected with eth1.</p><p>According to this information, I don&#039;t understand the behavior of my RB450G:<br />the eth0 interface (the software name in kernel) goes up first and has the AR8316 attached &amp; detected ...&nbsp; but it is also this interface that is used for the hardware port that is labeled Eth1/PoE and it gets an address from my DHCP!</p><p>On the other hand, eth1 interface (the software name in kernel) goes up second and does not communicate at all, and is not swconfig configurable. </p><p>Does anyone (KanjiMonster, russo) experience the same thing?</p><p>I am really missing the datasheets or other documentation for both the processor and switch chip ...</p>									</div>

					<p>I see I got the port map from KanjiMonster wrong - it relates to a routerstation device only, so I did some probes myself and found that on RB450G the ports are:</p><p>AR8316 Port Name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RB450G Port Name<br />PORT0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Internally connected to the processor MAC<br />PORT1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Eth2<br />PORT2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Eth5<br />PORT3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Eth4<br />PORT4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Eth3<br />PORT5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Eth1</p><p>I got stuck in the driver setup/configuration code of the switch, the port0 does not want to come up under any circumstances ... I did set the port speed to gigabit, turned off auto-negotiation and set it to be up ... but still nothing ... I suspect there are other registers that need to be adjusted, or that the MAC of the processor needs to be set up first, but from the source code I haven&#039;t come upon any ideas ... so any suggestions? :)&nbsp; .... I&#039;ll give it at try this afternoon.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey all, I am currently trying to get debian to work on the rb450g, and I have been using the proposed kernel patches from the openwrt project to do so. While doing that, I encountered a problem:</p><p>It seems that the RB450g bootloader is unable to boot a kernel larger than approximately 6M. I used the proposed patch to increase the portion of the nand flash which is supposed to store the kernel, but if I put a 6M kernel there and try to boot it, the bootloader will tell me &quot;kernel not found&quot;. If I put a smaller image there (~4M), all is fine. This means, for example, that it&#039;s impossible to boot an openwrt with initramfs from flash, or to boot a fully equipped kernel. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Does anyone know what this apparent limitation is caused by? Can I prevent it?</p><p>Cheers,<br />--<br />Rien</p>									</div>

					<p>Does anybody know if MikroTik provides their kernel patches? They seem to put some (binary?) stuff for download and advertise the use of linux-2.6.35: <a href="http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=45215&amp;p=227902">http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php … p;p=227902</a><br />I&#039;m interested in a reliable microsd support on this device.

					<p>RB450G is supported and i have several of them running OpenWRT. I have not used VLAN configurations and, as far as i know, microsd support do NOT exist for routerboard that have memory card slots, including RB450G.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. It is good to know that RB450G is at least usable with normal linux.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>leonardogyn wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>as far as i know, microsd support do NOT exist for routerboard that have memory card slots, including RB450G.</p></blockquote></div><p>The code for mmc support seems to be available in openwrt trunk (and commented out in backfire branch).
