					<p>I have here a DI-524 wireless router which is apparently partially supported by OpenWRT.&nbsp; Partial is fine.&nbsp; I&#039;m not intimidated by these things, I&#039;ve hacked around with hardware and software before, been using Linux personally and professionaly for years, and I&#039;m and prepared to work through things without being spoon-fed.</p><p>My question is...&nbsp; where do I start?&nbsp; Should I be building JTAG cables or kernels?&nbsp; Should I start with someone else&#039;s binary or build from sources?&nbsp; Any oddities I need to be aware of?</p>									</div>

					<p>I would check into the amount of flash and ram on that router, the <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/AtherosPort">http://wiki.openwrt.org/AtherosPort</a> says 1M/8M, which is too small I think...</p><p>You can install the micro version on a device with 2MB flash, but you have like 80K left.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netprince</strong> on 26 Jan 2007, 22:31)</p>
