					<p>All:</p><p>I&#039;ve gone over the wiki notes provided in (<a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer-c5-c7-wdr7500,">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/ar … 7-wdr7500,</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp;The wiki mentions support for this device in:&nbsp; is supported in trunk as of r47588 and in custom compiles of 15.05.1 newer than r49220.</p><p>So several questions:<br />1) When I use the squashfs-factory provided by zioncluster.ca, I am unable to then use the available packages provided for the 15.05.01 build.&nbsp; (problem with kernel compatibility).&nbsp; What does squashfs-sysupgrade provide and will it allow me to add any needed packages.</p><p>I have tried going the build route, have done a git clone and am building a firmware image.</p><p>2) Can anyone provide with the required .config to properly enable the Archer C7.&nbsp; Beyond the basic menus targetting the device, I can&#039;t tell what I should or should not include in the build.&nbsp; What .config is used for each of the binary builds available on the <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org">https://downloads.openwrt.org</a> site?</p><p>3)How does one know what branch one is using?&nbsp; I can&#039;t find any notes regarding what rXXXXX version has been pulled with the git clone I have.</p><p>Appreciate any help you can offer.</p><p>Peter</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Peter,</p><p>I also got this router.&nbsp; Love OpenWrt but I&#039;m not really willing to run trunk or beta builds on my routers.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to answer your questions and hopefully provide you with my result.</p><p>1) sysupgrade images are just to upgrade already installed OpenWrt installs.&nbsp; It won&#039;t fix the kernel compatibility issue with the zioncluster.ca firmware.&nbsp; That firmware is using kernel 3.18.27, where CC 15.05.1 is kernel 3.18.23.</p><p>2) See link below for the config I generated.&nbsp; I have no idea where to find what the OpenWrt maintainers use (seems this would be pretty important for generating repeatable builds, but maybe they don&#039;t care about that).&nbsp; My config includes the ath10k stuff as well as what appears to be the &quot;stock&quot; packages for other ar71xx firmwares (I based my list on a stock WNDR3700v2 which is also ar71xx generic).</p><p>3) Easily the biggest pain in the ass.&nbsp; What I ended up doing was logging into my WNDR3700v2 running CC15.05.1 and noticed its r48532.&nbsp; From there I could download the tree from <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/chaos_calmer?rev=48532&amp;order=name">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branche … order=name</a> (use the download link at the bottom of the page).&nbsp; That gets you the tree for 15.05.1 but the feeds.conf.default just references git branches.&nbsp; And those branches have seen updates since 15.05.1 was built.&nbsp; So for that, I just ended up going through each of the 5 default feeds and correlating the latest commit to what&#039;s on my stock WNDR3700v2.&nbsp; I can&#039;t guarantee they&#039;re exactly the same, but they should be damn close.</p><p>4) Lastly, I applied the 49220 changeset to enable support for gd25q128 in my build.</p><p>The whole goal here was to build something as close as possible to stock 15.05.1, but with support for gd25q128 (and kmod-ath10k and ath10k-firmware included).&nbsp; Since its very close or identical to stock CC 15.05.1, it should work with those packages as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, I did not have time to port the mktplinkfirmware changes such that it builds region compatible firmwares.&nbsp; You&#039;ll still have to use tftp or the &quot;flash to dd-wrt, flash revert, flash openwrt&quot; process.</p><p>Links:</p><p>config: <a href="https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz/~romracer/openwrt/archer-c7-v2-config">https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz … -v2-config</a><br />feeds.conf: <a href="https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz/~romracer/openwrt/cc-15.05.1-feeds.conf">https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz … feeds.conf</a><br />mydiffconfig: <a href="https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz/~romracer/openwrt/archer-c7-v2-mydiffconfig">https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz … diffconfig</a><br />factory: <a href="https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz/~romracer/openwrt/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin">https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz … actory.bin</a><br />sysupgrade: <a href="https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz/~romracer/openwrt/openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin">https://xenserver.underpants-gnomes.biz … pgrade.bin</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johndoe</strong> on 30 Jun 2016, 04:07)</p>

					<p>If you CBA with all this you could just flash Gargoyle. It has all the fixes for the c7. The latest build is here and is rock stable for me. <br /><a href="https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=8877">https://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/v … amp;t=8877</a><br />It&#039;s baste on the latest CC branch code.</p>									</div>

					<p>Sure, Gargoyle is an option - if you don&#039;t want to run OpenWrt.&nbsp; For me, I&#039;m trying to maintain a consistent environment (not everything is just your home router) so having multiple routers running different firmwares is just more work for me.&nbsp; It is worth the initial pain to get an image that ultimately suits me much better.</p><p>Regarding my previous post:</p><p>2) I did find OpenWrt publishes a changes.diff in the downloads folder.&nbsp; This can be used with a make menuconfig to seed a full blown .config file.&nbsp; You&#039;ll still need to do some things like pick your profile, but it gets you closer.</p><p>I&#039;ve updated the links in my previous post to my final build.&nbsp; As best I can tell, its the same as CC 15.05.1 release version.&nbsp; Kernel modules can be installed, etc.&nbsp; ath10k and ath10k-firmware are included automatically.&nbsp; And thankfully, when DD is released it&#039;ll natively support this platform/flash chip combo so this won&#039;t be necessary anymore.</p>									</div>
