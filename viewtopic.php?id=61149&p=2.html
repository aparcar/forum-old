					<p>Hi,<br />yes i checked the config file and it seems like it can´t really open the a.out file. On configure process i see it create a file named a.out but it can´t open it. Im trying to compile this package from my running system because there are some programs i can´t compile in from scratch. But they are already compiled in the distfeed. <br />I tried to compile a simple test.c program but now i get this error wich i solved for the configure on my testfile again<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: error: a.out uses VFP register arguments, /tmp/ccIBGblF.o does not
/usr/bin/ld: failed to merge target specific data of file /tmp/ccIBGblF.o </code></pre></div><p>I managed to add my own package(another one than i want to build in) to add it to my buildroot so i hope i can build it in from scratch i guess this gonna be the better way. But i still don´t know why gcc wont work on my System... And it would be much better when it does.</p><p>greetings</p>									</div>

					<p>AFAIK, a.out is a binary file and trying to open it using a text editor is not going to help. What you want to inspect is the configure file (the line # pointed out in the error message spit out by the configure process). From there, you can at least do some tracing why the configure process spits out the error message.</p><p>BTW, when you said you are trying to compile a package, did you mean a cross compile on your Linux desktop computer or a native compile on your device?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />i tried both compiling on my device and cross compile. Actually when i say compile i mean on the device. But after it´s not working i also tried to cross compile on a linux computer i just don´t know how to add packages wich i already compiled to my buildroot or SDK. Because Zbar,which i want to compile, need some more packages which aren´t available on trunk like pkg-config. So i compiled the package for my System but i don´t really know how i can take it to my SDK so ZBar &quot;knows&quot; that it´s available and can be compiled too.<br />But in general everything with that configure file is running on my device. <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>mazilo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>AFAIK, a.out is a binary file and trying to open it using a text editor is not going to help</p></blockquote></div><p>Yeah i didn´t try to open it with a editor. I just watched the process when typing &quot;./configure&quot; so the process automatically create the file and it´s not me who can´t open the file(because i don´t want to) but my process want to open it with the compiler (or sth. like that) but it says it can´t find the file which it create. </p><p>greetings</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Taulin</strong> on 15 Dec 2015, 12:15)</p>

					<p>So i checked the configure file step by step and can sayit´s very confusing...<br />It creates the a.out file the icon of this file is the same like a binary file so i guess this step works. So i go further step by step. It checked several conditions but at the point which it calls &quot;./a.out&quot; it says no such file or directory even when the file exists. I also commentéd out that section on which the configure removes the file so it isn´t possible that the file is missing on that part but it still cannot execute it . <br />I don´t know where the problem actually is. I guess it is not a problem from the configure file, thats why i tried to check the $PATH variable again and found following issue<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> /bin/ash: /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin: not found</code></pre></div><p> <br />And this is even more confusing... Why can´t it find my paths. I also checked the folders and they are all available im currently running out of ideas whats happening there.</p><p>EDIT: Forget my error with the path which i wrote before i simply forgot to put echo in front of it... But still i have no clue why it can´t find the file im still searching for my problem</p><p>greetings</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Taulin</strong> on 15 Dec 2015, 14:03)</p>

					<p>I still can´t find the error <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /><br />I don´t know where i have to look next. Im not cross compiling and it has nothing to do about missing programs(because the error is close to the beginnig of the config file). I still think it must have something to do with gcc or it´s path.<br />I can´t compile any other programs because of the called errors. So i tried to solve them with some instructions on the net. But those soulutions i found just helping a bit but the main problem stays.<br />Gcc or my configure program of the package can´t find the a.out file even when it´s created. I also changed the variables in the config file to get secure it is searching for the right filename. And even it´s creating the file on the right folder i don´t think the configure doesn´t search on the wrong folder. Maybe my package is on the wrong place(what i actually don´t think). I put it into my root folder so is it wrong? I think not.<br />Does anyone have a similar problem or got a solution for this?<br />Im really running out of ideas but i Need to compile my ZBar package for OpenWrt it´s very important because my Company want to include this into a project which already runs a OpenWrt system. </p><p>Thanks in advance</p>									</div>
