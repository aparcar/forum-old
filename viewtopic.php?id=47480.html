					<p>I just put the first release of my resource light audio player on GitHub. It is developed for small devices (typically routers running OpenWrt or Raspberry Pi&#039;s).</p><p>First part of README from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ErikOnBike/light-play">https://github.com/ErikOnBike/light-play</a></p><p>light-play<br />======<br />Resource light AirTunes player for streaming ALAC music files to Airport Express devices.</p><p>What is it?<br />------------<br />Light-play is currently a command line tool for sending your ALAC music files to an AirPort Express (or compatible?) device. It uses very little resources, hence its name. It should evolve into a light weight server to stream audio to AirPort Express and/or Apple TV devices. Only audio formats directly supported by the devices will be supported in light-play (ie no encoding/transcoding of audio). The server will have a web user interface to select audio and possibly use and maintain playlists.</p><p>Because of the resource friendly nature, it is suited well for small devices like routers running OpenWrt or Raspberry Pi&#039;s. (Only tested on OpenWrt for now)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ErikOnBike</strong> on 22 Nov 2013, 16:44)</p>
