					<p>Hi all.</p><p>I have a problem when i try to make a pppoe reconnect in whiterussian 0.9, from the web interface. (didn&#039;t tried from the command line but is certainly the same problem).</p><br /><p>Each time i try this, some Internet connectivity is lost. Pings to outside is still working, but udp connections are lost.</p><br /><p>It seems like something is not initialized correctly after the pppoe reconnect.</p><p>I&#039;m using x-wrt QOS. Could it be a problem with qos scripts ?</p><br /><p>Does someone have an idea why udp connectivity is lost after a pppoe reconnect ?</p><br /><p>I have the same problem each 24 hours, openwrt is trigering a pppoe reconnect, and after i lost connectivity. This restart is not necessary because i have a fixed ip adress from my provider.</p><p>Is there a way to stop openwrt from making pppoe reconnect each 24 hours ? This should be a simple way to solve the connectivity problem. My provider is issuing a pppoe disconnect only one time by week.</p><br /><p>But the better would be to solve the reconnect problem.</p><br /><p>It seems that there is no problem if the restart does come from the provider, when the pppoe session is closed to change the ip adress.</p><br /><p>The problem does appear only if the ip address does not change after the reconnect, when using a fixed ip pppoe connection.</p><br /><br /><p>To solve the problem, i need to reboot openwrt.</p><br /><p>Thanks for your help.</p><br /><p>Olivier.</p>									</div>
