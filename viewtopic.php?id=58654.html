One thing that might work is to create one sqm configuration for each timeslots and then use cron to replace the main configuration file and restart sqm. Or have cron call a script every hours that compares current speeds versus contracted speeds at the current time and that can replace the speeds in the sqm configuration and restart that (should be a few UCI calls). But how many different speed grades are in your contract to begin with?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So while there is no ready solution yet I am sure if you code something up other people might find it useful <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

So they are selling you a 3.3Mbps service as 152Mbps. Honestly I would change ISP immediately, as this they are not telling you clearly what they are selling.... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or you could do a simple cron job to reduce the sqm speed in the first hour of the restricted period to 6144Kbps and from the 2nd hour on to 4352Kbps to account for the worst case... (same for the weekend with different hours). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But really you need to raise awareness at your ISP that their marketing is highly misleading (unless their own router allows you to easily select a bandwidth restriction scheme that allows you to max out your volume allotment without crossing over into the restricted bandwidth regime, but good luck with that...).</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>stuart264 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Weekends</p><p>When does it apply&nbsp; &nbsp; 11AM - 11PM<br />Timeframe usage is measured over&nbsp; &nbsp; Previous 60 mins<br />1 Hour threshold&nbsp; &nbsp; 2250MB<br />1 Hour reduced speed&nbsp; &nbsp; 6144Kbps (-50%)<br />Duration of speed reduction&nbsp; &nbsp; 60 mins<br />Timeframe usage is measured over&nbsp; &nbsp; Previous 120 mins<br />2 Hour threshold&nbsp; &nbsp; 3000MB<br />2 Hour reduced speed&nbsp; &nbsp; 4352Kbps (-65%)<br />Duration of speed reduction&nbsp; &nbsp; 120 mins</p></blockquote></div><p>This is the same as above only for more hours (the hours people actually use the internet). Again change ISPs and let Virgin know why. And this is only going to be effective if enough people are doing it. Or alternatively sue them for misleading marketing. I am selling you 152Mbps but only under the condition you don&#039;t actually use that bandwidth does not seem permissible to me but I am not a lawyer...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On a positive note, it seems virgin cable admits that from 4PM-11PM during the week and from 11AM-11PM i=on the weekend their nodes/network is capacity bound/undersized. Very few ISPs actually are willing to tell you when they are going to suck <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><br /><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>

What I dislike most about what you described about their throttling is that it conflates bandwidth and volume as if they aimed to hide the fact that they throttle to 4.3 Mbps if you actually saturate your link during peak hours... <br /></p><div class="quotebox"><cite>stuart264 wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>As for changing ISP&#039;s at the moment that&#039;s not going to work, even the local cabinet being fitted with fibre the maximum speed I am being quoted is 80 Mbps from BT and 40Mbps from SKY and that&#039;s slower than living with Virgin&#039;s throttling.</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, now the penny drops, the throttled percentages 50% and 65% are correct not the numbers, as 152*0.5 = 76Mbps = 76000Kbps, and 152*0.35 = 53.2 Mbps = 53200Kbps. Then I agree the difference to BT during peak hours is not so large to make up for the much higher speeds during off-hours... You know that maybe you should run gargoyle instead of openwrt proper? Their active congestion control promises to deal with exactly your issue, fluctuating downstream bandwidth, by actively probing the link, so you might not have to configure anything specific. Sqm-scripts does not have such a mechanism, and I would be amazed if it grew one soon.</p><p>Best Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M.</p>									</div>
