					<p>I&#039;ve installed open-wrt on my new router and nearly anything works fine. The Idea was to create a sub net and use the router from my provider as a DMZ / guestnet. My current Configuration looks like this:</p><p>Public IP from <br />Provider&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.124.254&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.124.15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.123.254&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.123.11<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />Tenchnicolor-lan-------------------------------Wan-TP-Link Archer C7 v2.0-lan---------------------lan-Notebook<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DHCP-Range 192.168.124.0/24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DHCP-Range 192.168.123.0/24</p><br /><p>when i&#039;m scanning 192.168.124.15 (wan-ip of my open-wrt-router) with angry-ip-scanner it shows me, that ports 50 and 80 are open. I&#039;ve tried to access <a href="http://192.168.124.15:80/">http://192.168.124.15:80/</a> and get to the web-gui. Is it possible to close those 2 Ports on wan side? I&#039;m just confused, because I&#039;ve never change the default firewall configuration of openwrt and thought the wan ports would be closed per default.</p>									</div>

					<p>hi</p><p>you shouldnt have any wan port open by default</p><p>check<br />status&gt;firewall<br />network&gt;firewall&gt;port forward</p><p>edit: seems your TP-Link Archer C7 router is stock firmware... you could search to disable the ports you mentioned or forward them to a unused ip;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 11 Mar 2015, 15:30)</p>

					<p>Are you sure those ports are open on the WAN side? If you make the tests from the LAN interface, you cannot be sure<br />that those ports are accessible on the WAN side, even if you use the external IP address; I would connect the computer to the 192.168.124 network, and repeat the tests from there.</p>									</div>
