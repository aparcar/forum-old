					<p>Hi,</p><p>I just tried installing openvpn. Seems that &#039;libopenssl&#039; needs 698kb, but there are only 640kb available in total. My question is: I have the D-Link Dir 615-H1. This device has 4 MB of flash memory (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-615#hardware_highlights">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir- … highlights</a>). Is there any possibility to get more of these 4MB for me or does openWRT really need the approximately 3,32MB it seems to use? (Please mind: The 640kB are the total size of my /overlay respectively rootfs, not the used space, so deleting packages will not solve this problem <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />)</p>									</div>

					<p>You may be able to run the AA version which is smaller.&nbsp; </p><p>Or use Image Builder to make a custom image with whatever you can afford to leave out taken out, and ssl included in the squashts.&nbsp; Placing binaries and other non-changing files in the squashfs when you make the image uses less flash space than adding them to the jffs later.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 7 Jun 2015, 01:07)</p>

					<p>You can&#039;t actually remove anything from the squashfs (rom) at run-time.&nbsp; When you &#039;remove&#039; a file, it puts a marker in the overlayfs saying &#039;this file no longer exists&#039;-- which actually takes up more space.</p><p>To remove a package that is in the initial image and reclaim its space in your flash chip, you have to rebuild the squashfs off-line on another machine, leaving out that package, then flash that custom image.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 7 Jun 2015, 03:23)</p>

					<p>It depends on what packages you run.&nbsp; Each package you add takes up some <br />memory and most need additional memory for working storage. At some point <br />32MB isn’t enough and either performance suffers or it crashes.</p><p>I don’t know if there is web page that lists the memory requirements for different <br />packages.</p>									</div>
