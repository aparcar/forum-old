					<p>Looks like a conventional RT5350 device, with a built in USB hub and card reader.&nbsp; With a serial console you can boot initrd images of OpenWrt to see if they work, without changing anything in the flash.&nbsp; This also allows you to make a backup of the original flash.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 4 Jan 2015, 17:22)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve been a long time user of the &quot;other&quot; open source router project. I&#039;ve used openwrt rarely so far, but finding I can flash my EasyAcc wi-stor is intriguing.</p><p>If I move to the openwrt version mentioned here, will I still have access to the SD card and USB devices, at least from the linux prompt? The vendor&#039;s firmware integrates with phone APPs to allow transfers, so I wonder there&#039;s any equivalent mechanism for openwrt. Also, the wi-stor could connect to one wifi network and create a separate network with a different ssid, and act as a gateway. Possible using openwrt on this device?</p><p>Anyone else working on getting this going? I have the serial port connected and I&#039;ve poked around on the existing vendor firmware. No way I&#039;ve found to open up telnet, without flashing new firmware.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>i_void_warranties</strong> on 20 Apr 2016, 22:35)</p>

					<p>This might sound very stupid from my part I admit that but.... is there any step-by-step on how to change the original firmware from my EasyAcc WI STOR 101 storage to the OpenWRT?</p><p>I can see a great improvement on changing the firmware and I will really try since I do not use the current Router capability .... I saw someone saying that through a SD card is possible to have a bootable version (not sure if its&nbsp; really it) but that would be great eighter....</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fernandoavc</strong> on 16 Aug 2016, 20:49)</p>

					<p>My progress has come this far:</p><p>1. Connect serial 3,3V USB-TTL device to board by soldering. A real RS232 port will only show garbage in your terminal, as voltages are inverted with the decades old standard.</p><p>2. Setting up a TFTP server, providing initramfs image from EasyAcc Wi-Stor Wizard 8800 OpenWRT techdata page.</p><p>3. When uboot started, i selected </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>1: Load system code to SDRAM via TFTP.</code></pre></div><p> and started the image.</p><p>4. I made backups of uBoot, uBoot settings, factory and stock firmware with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=/dev/mtd0 of=/tmp/mtd0.backup
dd if=/dev/mtd1 of=/tmp/mtd1.backup
dd if=/dev/mtd2 of=/tmp/mtd2.backup
dd if=/dev/mtd3 of=/tmp/mtd3.backup</code></pre></div><p>the file sizes are 192, 64, 64, 3776 kB -&gt; sums up to an exact 4MB.</p><p>5. Get the backup files off the device by SSH/WinSCPing into it. <br />Before this, SSH must be enabled by setting a password.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>passwd
*</code></pre></div><p>As no physical connection is open, with which you could transfer files, we need to enable WiFi.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set wireless.@wifi-device[0].disabled=0
uci commit wireless
wifi</code></pre></div><p>Of course the client which loads the backups must have configured a working IP configuration.<br />You&#039;ll get an idea how to do this by helping yourself with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ifconfig -a</code></pre></div><p>6. Flash a non-stock firmware to the device.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>reboot</code></pre></div><p>choose uBoot option:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> 2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP. </code></pre></div><br /><p>This is the point where i run into problems:<br />uBoot loader won&#039;t take any squashfs image larger than 3866624 Bytes (0x3B0000) = 4MB -192 -64 -64 kB<br />The provided sysupgrade squashfs image from the page mentioned in part 2 is too large and the bootloader will refuse to flash it. But i managed to flash a squashfs 17.01.2 LEDE image with a size of 3408044 Bytes (0x3400AC) onto the router. So far it will boot up, show partitions to save config and additional installed software.</p><p>WORKS this far. Saving settings is rebootsafe.</p><p>But things aren&#039;t optimal:<br />There&#039;s only about 500kB free space left to install software like luci, vpn, vnstat, adblock, dyndns or similar, which is really not much. Taking a look at the image file sizes, there should be about some 450kB -root -rootfs of space which are not used. I have no idea on how to compile an image which will leave me with extra flash space for some tools and drivers by setting fixed partition sizes.</p><p>And i am stuck at the point that i don&#039;t understand why the techdata page shows that flash size is 8MB, but after all i had to use image files which won&#039;t exceed 4MB flash size as the flash chip W25Q32BV probably is of 32Mbit/4Mbyte size.</p><p>I haven&#039;t had the guts to tamper with the uboot loader, as i suspect the 4MB limit might come from there?<br />I would be grateful for any clue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>molocho</strong> on 31 Aug 2017, 17:17)</p>
