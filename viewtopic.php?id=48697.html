					<p>Hi - I am new to OpenWrt, I just finished my first compilation - yaaay :) ! - and I&#039;d like to experiment with an 802.11ac router (or routers). What would be a decently priced, decently spec&#039;ed option (or options) ? Any help is appreciated. Thank you !</p><p>Ionut</p>									</div>

					<p>There are only 1+ Routers that support OpenWrt and have 802.11ac.

					<p>The NBG6716 just got some support (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/40502/trunk">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/40502/trunk</a>). Price should be around €160.</p><p>Also, Linksys/Belkin announced OpenWRT support for the upcoming WRT1900ac. This is an expensive one though, €279, and it should become available in retail next week. Therefore, not much is known about this one yet: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt1900ac</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>avbohemen</strong> on 14 Apr 2014, 17:09)</p>

					<p>You *do not* need to &quot;open up&quot; an archer c7 to determine if it is good. Check the label on the RETAIL BOX or BOTTOM of the router, look for the hardware revision number. v1 = BAD. v2 = GOOD.</p>									</div>
