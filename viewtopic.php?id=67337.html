					<p>Hey there,</p><p>I&#039;m new to OpenWRT and just got myself a TP-Link RE580D WiFi Extender. The stock firmware really isn&#039;t that bad (well, it was, but upgrading to the latest release helped it a lot), but just offers very few settings on the RE&#039;s actual behavior. I have seen that other TP-Link WiFi repeater models, such as RE200 and RE450, are supported by OpenWRT. Is there a chance that support for the RE580D will be added?</p><p>Kind,<br />Joe</p>									</div>
