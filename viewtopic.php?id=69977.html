					<p>Hello,</p><p>Recently I tried to install OpenWRT on my Nanostation M5 (XM) following the official tutorial but as the page didn&#039;t mention that a previous downgrade was required for devices with AirOS v5.6.x installed now I think I bricked my device :&#039;(</p><p>I would really appreciate any help!</p><br /><p><span class="bbu">This is what I did</span>:<br /></p><ul><li><p>Previous the update, the AirOS version was v5.6.2 (XM)</p></li><li><p>I tried to install OpenWRT (openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-nano-m-squashfs-factory.bin) through the AirOS web interface. During the update process the AirOS web interfase window showed the message:</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Uploaded Firmware Version: XM.v6.0.0-OpenWrt-r42625
    WARNING: Uploaded Firmware is from third-party, make sure you&#039;re familiar with the recovery procedure!</code></pre></div><ul><li><p>After the update process the device stopped responding (No response from Web interface nor from Ping command)</p></li><li><p>Using TFTP I updated to the AirOS version (XM.v5.6.5.bin). The updated process showed no error, however there was still no response from Web interface nor from Ping command.</p></li><li><p>Using TFTP I tried to install a downgrade firmware (XM.v5.5.11.bin), however the process ended with the error:</p></li></ul><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    tftp: error received from server &lt;Firmware check failed&gt;
    tftp: aborting</code></pre></div><ul><li><p>In TFTP mode I receive a ping response from 192.168.1.20</p></li></ul><br /><p>What makes me really crazy is that when I try to connect through RS232 I receive strange characters from the device (?!). I tried using both a USB-RS232 converter and a direct connection to the pc-motherboard COM port and I receive in both these non sense characters. I&#039;m using minicom for the connection.<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>$ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -o -b 115200 -8<br />$ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyS0 -o -b 115200 -8</p></blockquote></div><p>This is an image of the strange characters:<br />h_ttp://i64.tinypic.com/n65jj7.png</p><p>This an image showing the characters in hexadecimal:<br />h_ttp://i63.tinypic.com/j5l0l0.png</p><br /><p><span class="bbu">When I connect the antenna to the power I can see the following leds activity</span>:<br />[POWER, LAN1, LAN2, SIG1, SIG2, SIG3, SIG4]<br /></p><ul><li><p>t0: <br />POWER: Green<br />LAN1, LAN2: Green (just for a few milliseconds then went off)<br />SIG2: Orange (just for a few milliseconds then went off)</p></li><li><p>t2: <br />POWER, LAN1, LAN2: Green (LAN1 &amp; LAN2 went off a second latter &gt; t3)</p></li><li><p>t15: <br />POWER: Green<br />LAN1, LAN2: Green (just for a few milliseconds then went off)<br />SIG2: Orange (just for a few milliseconds then went off)<br />SIG3: Very week green (just for a few milliseconds then went off)</p></li><li><p>t30: Same as t15</p></li><li><p>t45: Same as t15, t30</p></li></ul><br /><p>Is my device permanently bricked? Is there anything I can do to recover it?</p><p>Thank you!!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bawfree</strong> on 23 Feb 2017, 02:36)</p>

					<p>I think I may be in the same position as you. I just created a new topic myself. The difference is that I have installed OpenWRT to AirRouter with firmware v5.6.2. And I also can&#039;t ping my device or access LuCi (web interface). Do you really think that this is &quot;bricked&quot; status?</p>									</div>

					<p>If recovery fails for official firmware then this is a serious issue and these devices should be returned to Ubiquiti and requested to give you a working one that you can flash OpenWrt to.</p>									</div>
