					<p>I am looking to use ser2net to establish an SSH (secure) connection between a terminal and my device. Telnet is readily supported by ser2net. I tried setting the state to raw (instead of telnet) in ser2net.conf, but this still does not allow an SSH connection (however, it still allows a Telnet connection with extra characters being displayed in the terminal). </p><p>Any thoughts on how to accomplish this? Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, stangri.</p><p>I should have been more specific with my application. I am looking to SSH over TCP/IP into my serial device via a PuTTY terminal on a PC. An OpenWrt cellular-to-serial router handles the communication between the terminal and my serial device; ser2net is implemented to enable the TCP/IP to serial conversion. My serial device is resource constrained, and therefore does not implement minicom nor cu. The router runs BusyBox and implements microcom (not minicom nor cu). Therefore, I was hoping for a way that I could just reconfigure ser2net to connect via SSH instead of Telnet (without having to dive into ser2net&#039;s source code).</p><p>I think you are saying for your application you just needed to ssh between the terminal on a PC and your OpenWrt device, and used minicom/cu on the OpenWrt device to access its console? Seems like if I can get cu onto my serial device I should be able to get a secure console connection to it just like you; just have to configure ser2net to point to the DB-9 port on my OpenWrt router (which connects to my serial device) instead of the serial connection to your OpenWrt device&#039;s uP console port.</p>									</div>

					<p>I assume you tried a port tunnel:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh root@&lt;router&gt; -L 2000:&lt;router IP&gt;:2000</code></pre></div><p>This will create a port 2000 on your PC that is a tunnel to port 2000 on the router, which leads to ser2net.&nbsp; So then you would (in another process while keeping the ssh connection open) telnet to localhost:2000 on your PC.</p><p>Another approach is what stangri said, remove ser2net and install picocom, minicom, etc. instead on the router.&nbsp; Then<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh &lt;router&gt; &quot;picocom -b115200 /dev/ttyUSB0&quot;</code></pre></div><p>This launches picocom on the router, which communicates with the serial port and uses your ssh session as the terminal.</p><p>In both cases the communication over the Internet between the router and the PC will be encrypted, and proper ssh login credentials will be required to open the connection.</p>									</div>
