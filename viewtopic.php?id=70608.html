					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m new to this forum and OpenWRT in general.</p><p>I&#039;m very interested in contributing to the project by (helping in) adding support for the D-Link DIR 845L, I own.</p><p>I already created a device page (wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/d-link/d-link_dir-845l_rev._a1) in the wiki,<br />I was able to access the device via telnet and serial and I opened the case, thereby I got all the required data.</p><p>An &quot;attached&quot; 7z file contains further data, I was able to collect thusfar.<br />file-upload.net/download-12440485/OpenWRT.7z.html</p><p>The 7z contains:<br /></p><ul><li><p>2 prebuild Wifi binaries from the GPL tarball (one for 2.5 and one for 5 GHz)</p></li><li><p>architecture diff</p></li><li><p>includes diff</p></li><li><p>drivers diff</p></li><li><p>a text file with lines from the bootloader, that looked important to me</p></li><li><p>data I got from traversing the linux file tree using telnet and cat</p></li></ul><p>firmware released under GPL:<br />tsd.dlink.com.tw/GPL.asp</p><br /><p>I hope the devs, who implemented/set up the Ralink plattform in the past will be able to help/guide me further.</p><p>I know, that I need to setup a build root now and create a flash driver and a device tree.</p><p>What I don&#039;t know for example is, how I should proceed with the given kernel config from the tarball or the diff files in general.<br />I skipped through them already, but I&#039;m probably missing lots of knowledge to be able to filter out what&#039;s important and what isn&#039;t.</p><p>Stuff that confused me a bit:<br />/proc/cpuinfo and other places seem to list stuff, that isn&#039;t accurate in every case.<br />The cpu isn&#039;t the Ralink RT63165 after all and the flash isn&#039;t exactly called MX25L12805D.<br />I guess the RT63165 might be similar enough to the RT6856F or it&#039;s some kind of family and RT6856F is a part of it.</p><p>I&#039;ll definitely be able to test out first tries of the firmware and provide logs and so on.</p><p>Thx in advance! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Regards,<br />Djfe</p><p>PS:<br />The forum didn&#039;t let me use bb codes for the links, probably because I&#039;m new.</p>									</div>

					<p>Something I just noticed:<br />The DIR-626L, DIR-636L, DIR-826L and DIR-836L and this device, the DIR-845L<br />All seem to share the same CPU, some also wifi and the switch (according to wikidevi, techinfodepot, some blog and my own research) <br />so adding Plattform support for one of them might be one big step forwards to getting support for all of them into openwrt in the future <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>wikidevi.com/wiki/D-Link_DIR-636L_rev_A1<br />techinfodepot.info/wiki/D-Link_DIR-836L_rev_A1<br />love4taylor.lofter.com/post/277888_18f255c</p><p>the Linksys WAP300N will likely also profit from support<br />wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wap300n<br />natthapol89.com/2014/01/linksys-wap300n.html?m=1</p><p>edit:<br />and more: <br />NetcommWireless N300 NF5<br />framasphere.org/posts/682014</p><p>Linksys re2000<br />redeszone.net/cisco-linksys/re2000/</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Djfe</strong> on 17 Apr 2017, 05:28)</p>
