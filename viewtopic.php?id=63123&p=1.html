					<p>As we are all aware, TPLink jumped the gun on the FCC decision regarding firmware lockouts which made re-flashing the devices with OpenWRT through the webUI next to impossible. After a couple weeks of disassembling and reverse engineering their changes, a friend and I came up with what we think is a quick and easy solution that anyone can do.</p><p>Requirements:<br/>1. You will need a FAT formatted thumb drive for this to work.<br/>2. <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.16.1/busybox-mips">http://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1 … sybox-mips</a></p><p>Steps:<br/>1. Take your FAT formatted thumb drive, and download the above busybox executable to the root path of the thumb drive.<br/>2. Create a script called &#039;f.sh&#039; with the following code in it:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
echo &#039;FREE_UPDATE = 1&#039; &gt;&gt; /tmp/dec-model.conf

/usr/bin/httpd -f &amp;</code></pre></div><p>3. Plug in the drive to the TPLink and go to the wireless network settings, and set your SSID to: (note the difference between ` and &#039;)<br/></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>a `/tmp/usbdisk/volume1/f.sh`</code></pre></div><p>4. Submit, and then go to the firmware upload part. Upload OpenWRT. Bob&#039;s your uncle.</p><p>Update: Tested and works on multiple WR710N&#039;s. Your mileage will vary at this point based on feedback below. If it works, please let this threat know so I&#039;ll keep a rolling list of devices it works for and doesn&#039;t.

					<p>Two unrelated questions .....</p><p>1) how do you tell you are getting the model of TL-WR710N that has the 8M flash chip?</p><p>2) is this 3600 a good performing router when compared to those from other mfgs at almost double the price?</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>**** I just found the info regarding the 710N, however, unfortunately the retailers I find selling them don&#039;t seem to list the version numbers to this level of detail.&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr710n">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr710n</a></p><p>**** Looks like many of the negative comments describe a short lifespan for the TL-WDR3600 or other connectivity problems that upgrades or changes in firmware don&#039;t resolve,&nbsp; (See the comments on this device <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704144)">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a … 833704144)</a>&nbsp; Also noting that some of the lower ratings on Amazon regard longevity as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;So early failure appears to be an issue with this as well as initial firmware issue, which I am assuming OpenWRT helps.&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: It&#039;s always hard to determine how to react when you see a 4 star average of comments and the negative ones are consistent in the area of describing how the product fails after a year or two, and considering all the positive ones could conceivably be early on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now I&#039;m thinking I will continue to look elsewhere for a similar OpenWRT supported router in the $50US-$100US price range.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DonJuane</strong> on 8 Mar 2016, 18:33)</p>

					<p>yes the US firmware i provide is exact the solution i&#039;m talking about. this just has a changed firmware cheader which sets the correct region code for flashing. there is no lock down. rigtht after the hw revision just a region code has been added which is &quot;1&quot; for US america and &quot;0&quot; for anything else like before. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>keyboardgnome wrote:</cite><blockquote><div class="quotebox"><cite>BrainSlayer wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>sometimes i think people here arent that clever. tplink hasnt a real lockdown. weeks of reverse engineering and you still havent found that just a single byte in the header has changed? its no lockdown. its just a region code within the header which makes the trick. thats also the reason why dd-wrt can still be flashed. i added this already in september 2015&nbsp; after we discovered that change</p></blockquote></div><br/><p>Yeah, I tried the DD-WRT firmware and multiple other methods to no avail. This has worked on multiple WR710N&#039;s so far. Instead of attacking a solution and providing no meaningful discussion, maybe you can be helpful and document in detail a solution that works? As I mentioned before, the solutions posted by DD-WRT did NOT work for this firmware, hence spending time on it.</p><p>Which byte(s) are you referring to (there&#039;s a lot of difference between the versions)? This firmware (151022_US) came out in late October 2015, so I don&#039;t know which solution you&#039;re referring to.</p></blockquote></div>									</div>
