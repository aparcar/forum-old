					<p>Hello, my patch to support that device got merged in trunk some days ago, wait some days for compiled images to be released<br />Also in the meantime if you want to see how to use the serial port ( especially which missing resistors you have to bridge ) :</p><p><a href="http://linuxehacking.ovh/2016/02/13/installing-openwrt-on-tp-link-tl-wa801nd-v3/">http://linuxehacking.ovh/2016/02/13/ins … a801nd-v3/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>I recently got a few of these devices in, firmware V3.&nbsp; When trying to flash the firmware snapshot, I was getting the 18005 error.&nbsp; My suspicion is that these particular units are new enough to have the&nbsp; &quot;locked-down&quot; firmware from tp-link.&nbsp; I will try to do some work on this soon, but wanted to start the ball rolling here.&nbsp; I suspect we can come up with a fix for this, hope to have more info soon.</p>									</div>

					<p>This tutorial worked fine for me but as i am not so familiar with configuring the device through the command shell i wanted to install the web interface luci. <br />As it turned out, there is not enough space left, so i want to try to build a new image with luci.<br />My question now is, which trunk version should i use.

					<p>Hi there,</p><p>My post is two fold.</p><p>1) Any idea when a stripped v3 recovery file might be available?</p><p>2) I am a newbie when it comes to OpenWRT but can follow instructions. I got Luci up and running on my V3 but, for some odd reason, when trying to use a WPA network as my &#039;&#039;source&#039;&#039; from which I was repeating a signal from, it dropped connection after 10 seconds. WPA2 networks worked just fine. Must be a bug. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thanks so much!</p>									</div>
