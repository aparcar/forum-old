					<p>I have TP-LINK TL-WR841ND wireless router. Its chip supports USB, however,<br />TL-WR841ND does not have a physical USB port (although its possible to add through a hardware mod, only a few people have done it)</p><p>For all the routers with this chip, USB_SUPPORT (and AUDIO_SUPPORT, which depends on USB_SUPPORT) - are enabled and hardcoded in <strong>target/Config.in</strong> file. They can&#039;t be disabled through &quot;make menuconfig&quot;, the only way to disable them is by manually editing <strong>target/Config.in</strong> to comment these lines:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># config AUDIO_SUPPORT &lt;--- commented both lines
#        bool &lt;--- commented both lines</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config PCI_SUPPORT
# select AUDIO_SUPPORT &lt;--- only this line is commented
bool</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code># config USB_SUPPORT &lt;--- all three lines are commented
#        select AUDIO_SUPPORT &lt;--- all three lines are commented
#        bool &lt;--- all three lines are commented</code></pre></div><p>Why this is a problem? TL-WR841ND has a small flash chip - just 4MB, quite hard to fit all the good stuff there. By disabling the unnecessary USB_SUPPORT and AUDIO_SUPPORT options, for a device which does not have USB port (without a hardware mod), I save about 100-150 KB which is HUGE ! Probably some people who has another router with USB port, but dont use this port, would want to disable these options to save space</p><p><strong>dear OpenWRT developer, please:</strong><br /><strong>1)</strong> Make it possible to enable/disable these options from menuconfig<br /><strong>2)</strong> Disable these options by default for the routers without a hardware USB port (like TL-WR841ND), but let them to be enabled just in case someone has done a hardware mod</p><p><strong>P.S.</strong> posting this ticket here because the official place for OpenWRT tickets does not allow a registration for new users (Trac anti-spam system bans you even if you successfully enter the captcha code!)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mward15</strong> on 8 Jan 2017, 14:14)</p>

					<p>Delete .config (don&#039;t forget to make a backup first, in necessary).</p><p>Run make menuconfig and select the Target System (Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx) and the target Profile for your router and save and exit. Run make defconfig and make menuconfig again.</p><p>When I do this, nothing is selected, even while CONFIG_AUDIO_SUPPORT=Y in .config. I would not edit the Config.in files, if I were you; you might break something.</p><p>If you cannot disable an option in menuconfig, it&#039;s probably because you have selected something else that depends on that option. Select &lt; Help &gt; in menuconfig when on that option and you can see what it selects and by what it is selected.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>maartenjd</strong> on 8 Jan 2017, 19:07)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m also interested in this.&nbsp; My Trendnet TEW732BR v1.x board is reported to have a usb pin holes that are unpopulated with the actual usb socket.&nbsp; I&#039;m a little less compulsive, compared to the OP, about the flash/ram as the TEW732BR has 8mb flash and 64mb ram.&nbsp; Still, I think the purpose of the project is to be able to tailor the firmware to the hardware - one size does not always fit all.</p><p>As an aside, If one were to attempt to optimize an AR71xx build for the TEW732BR, what is the recommended Build Platform - I mainly use OpenBSD.&nbsp; My favorite Linux is Debian but my attempts with the build script in Debian amd64 Testing segfaulted.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>shep</strong> on 9 Jan 2017, 05:11)</p>
