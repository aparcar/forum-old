					<p>Hi all. I am a big time noob trying to install openwrt on the wzr-hp-g300nh because i was disappointed with ddwrt. <br />I was following the installation process on the wiki but I am having lots of trouble with flashing the router-- to tftp the .bin i am using powershell on windows 7, and get errors when i try to add a static arp for the router, so i get timed out when i try to tftp the .bin (I had all firewalls disabled). Im also not sure about the &quot;Set computer interface to IP address in the 192.168.11.x range (e.g. 192.168.11.2)&quot; step- I can manually set my computer&#039;s ip address to 192.168.11.2 through the network settings but then it wont connect to any network/communicate with the router unless its set to &#039;obtain ip address automatically.&#039; I have no experience with linux so i was hoping that I&#039;d be able to do this through windows but am afraid it may be too complicated. Sorry if my mistakes in this process are real stupid! I thought i should just give up and settle for ddwrt but want to give this a try. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>suilx</strong> on 28 Aug 2010, 11:41)</p>

					<p>1. Press the Win keyboard key or click on the Start button.<br />2. Type cmd into the Start Search textbox.<br />3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter keyboard shortcut. Ctrl-Shift-Enter is the general keyboard shortcut that triggers elevation to “Run as Administrator”.<br />4. Press Alt+C or press Continue to confirm the UAC elevation warning prompt.<br />5. Type &quot;netsh int ipv4 set neighbor 192.168.11.1 &lt;MAC address of router&gt;&quot;&nbsp; replace &lt;MAC address of router&gt; with your router&#039;s MAC address.<br />6. Type arp -a<br />7. You should now see a static arp entry for 192.168.11.1.<br />8. Set your lan interface to 192.168.11.2, netmask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.11.1.<br />9. Disconnect power from the router and leave it unpluged for at least 30 seconds.&nbsp; Also disconnect any USB devices that are connected to the router (do not reconnect the USB device until OpenWrt is installed and running.<br />10. When you are ready to tftp the image to the router, start tftp first and then connect the power to the router.<br />11. If for some reason it doesn&#039;t work, go back to step 6.<br />12. If successful then set your lan interface back to obtain an IP address and DNS server address automatically.<br />13. Configure OpenWrt to your liking.</p><p>There is no need to delete the arp entry the we created with netsh unless you are on a large network, in which case you would probably be using a much more powerful router.</p><p>Charles</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks very much Charles. I was able to get openwrt going on my 300nh and now its working much better. I had to do something slightly different to add the static arp entry (I dont know if its a windows 7 thing), and in case it may help another windows user, I had to type:<br />&quot;&nbsp; netsh int ipv4 set neighbor &quot;Local Area Connection&quot; &quot;192.168.11.1&quot; &quot;&lt;MAC address of router&gt;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;</p><p>I also did not double check on the status of all firewalls before doing the tftp transfer, and at the very beginning I didn&#039;t know that the .bin file had to be in the system 32 file folder for the tftp transfer to work--maybe some additions can be made to the g300nh wiki under the windows section?</p><p>I had another question about transmit power: is there a certain configuration needed to achieve dBm higher than 27? If I enter it as 29 or 30 under admin&gt;network&gt;wifi&gt;radio0,&nbsp; &nbsp;it still shows up as 27 under essentials&gt;network&gt;wifi (this is @ 20 MHz),</p><p>also if someone could direct me toward info about being able to set limits on bandwidth per user on wifi/lan connection that would be greatly appreciated</p><p>Thanks again for all the help</p>									</div>

					<p>How I got ushare Upnp media server running in 10.03.1-rc3<br />1. Install luci-app-ushare via 192.168.1.1 in your browser Administration mode:System --&gt;software<br />2. I couldn&#039;t get it to work with the default initscript so I went to Services--&gt;Initscripts and disbaled the ushare one and the ushare service should also be disabled in Services Ushare.<br />3. Open putty and login to 192.168.1.1 with your username and password type &quot;route add -net 239.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 br-lan&quot; to open up a upnp route (not 100% sure if this is necessary but do it anyway)<br />3. Type &quot;cd /etc&quot; to change directory to etc<br />4. type &quot;ls&quot; to list files and there should be one called ushare.conf<br />5. Open ushare.conf using the vi editor by typing &quot;vi ushare.conf&quot; then press I to go into input mode and type in the required settings (there is an explanation beside each one), only one you may not be certain of is interface which I set to br-lan and I set the port =49200 and if you put the webinterface to yes you can get a web interface by going to <a href="http://192.168.1.1:49200/web/ushare.html">http://192.168.1.1:49200/web/ushare.html</a> when finished press Esc to go out of input mode and type &quot;:wq&quot; to save and quit<br />6. change directory back to the root using &quot;cd /&quot; and run the command &quot;ushare -x -D -f /etc/ushare.conf&quot; where -x specifies xbox compatible mode as I have an xbox, -D specifies daemon mode (I couldn&#039;t get it to work without this) and -f specifies to use the config file you have just made.</p><p>Note this will not survive a reset and you have to run this everytime the router is rebooted</p><p>Only other issue was that I could only get it to work if I share a single directory, initially i had shared /mnt/usb/music, /mnt/usb/movies but none of the movies were showing up and the xbox just gave me a massive list of around 1000 folders contained in the music directory (there should have been 1700) with no way of searching them or sorting them and no access to my movies folder&nbsp; so instead I shared /mnt/usb and now I can manually move to required directory, as it seems if you share a folder with tons of directories it only shows the first 1000 or so and you can&#039;t see the rest.<br />Also I had some .mp4 files that I had to rename to .avi in order to make the xbox play them.</p><p>All the ushare commands can be found here:http://linux.die.net/man/1/ushare</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>k4021</strong> on 5 Oct 2010, 00:39)</p>

					<p>Does anyone know how to flash this router from OpenWRT back to DD-WRT or stock? I currently have DD-WRT build 15940 on my WZR and it&#039;s working okay, but I heard that this router is much better with OpenWRT. Wiki provides a guide on how to flash from DD-WRT to OpenWRT without tftp and it looks pretty simple. What I need now is a way to go back (either stock or DD-WRT will work fine) in case something goes wrong or once DD-WRT starts using ath9k.</p><p>I have Brainslayer&#039;s wzrg300nh_original.bin but I don&#039;t know what to do with it; I have heard that webflash will not work and isn&#039;t the bin too big for tftp? It&#039;s about 20 MB.</p>									</div>

					<p>Download lastest firmware from Buffalo&#039;s website and then use tftp to flash it.&nbsp; Remember that when using tftp with this router you have to set a static arp address for the router&#039;s default IP address of 192.168.11.1 and then when tftp&#039;ing you use the default IP address of 192.168.11.1.&nbsp; </p><p>Look at further up in this thread for windows 7 help.&nbsp; </p><p>Charles</p>									</div>

					<p>I recently install backfire 10.03 on a buffalo wzr-hp-g300nh, i think it is the last released, and i did not have to install kmod-ath9k and wpad-mini. There were installed already. I have several issues with WDS links, but every is working fine for me right now. The problem you have with internet it may be anything, since you do not provide info of your router, left a copy of /etc/config/network and ifconfig, and i am sure we can reply a solution for you.</p>									</div>
