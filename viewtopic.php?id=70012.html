					<p>Hello, good evening.<br/>I bought a new Archer C7 and would like to install openwrt, but It is unfortunately not possible. <br/>Firmware Version: &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.15.1 Build 160616 Rel.44182n<br/>Hardware Version: &nbsp; &nbsp; Archer C7 v2 00000000<br/>Whenever I&#039;ve tried it, I got an error with the number 18005. I read on the net, that an older firmware should be installed. So I tried first the original firmware in version ArcherC7v2_v3_en_3_14_1_up_boot (141110) .bin. But always I got the error message Error 18005. </p><p>With an FTDI adapter I have access to the router. However, root access is not possible. Root requires a password that does not match with the specified. If I enter anything via Putty, the router asks for the password and the login.</p><p>What can I do? How can I install openwrt on the router?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Ps: Sorry for my bad english</p>									</div>

					<p>Show the wiki page of the archer c7.<br/>Try tftp update. You need to write three characters in very short time, while the uboot loader boot process.<br/>Read about tftp and uboot also in similar router wiki pages.</p>									</div>

					<p>The problem is now solved. If you press in the first seconds after the restart &quot;tpl&quot; + enter and you get to an recovery-menue. Then you can enter the command &quot;tftpboot&quot;. After that the router will show you what he need. For example is he looking for an image it called &quot;6F01A8C0.img&quot;. And so I have renamed openwrt-15.05.1-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin into 6F01A8C0.img. The IP which the router is waiting for is 192.168.1.100 . If I have taken another one like 192.168.0.66 or so on the tftp failed. </p><p>Thank you dnkru for your replay that gave me the right direction.</p>									</div>
