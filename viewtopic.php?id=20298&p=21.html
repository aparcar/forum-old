					<p>Hi lashmish,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I believe you are talking about connecting the PC com port directly to the routerboard&#039;s serial pins..

					<p>Hey, guys! It`s me again ;]]] I bought this board <a href="http://www.sigma-shop.com/manuals/ftdi_manual.pdf">http://www.sigma-shop.com/manuals/ftdi_manual.pdf</a> and I tried to stop the u-boot process - failed again. 3.3v , gnd to gnd, rx-tx and tx-rx 115200 8n1n. I`ve got all messages from the router but can`t send anything. The cables from the board to the router are about 20cm long. So now I`m thinking that there`s something wrong with my router, so I guess I`ll have to throw it in the garbage.. ;] Any ideas left?</p>									</div>

					<p>See page #1 of this thread.&nbsp; I talked about my FTDI cable which had similar issues.

					<p>Hello folks,</p><p>after playing for a long time with Vincents great port of Kamikaze for the wrt160nl I&#039;m no longer able to get a working firmware image installed with latest revision r19885 from trunk. When switching to jffs2 a message occurs &quot;jffs2 not ready yet; using ramdisk&quot;. The jffs2 was created successfully by firstboot after flashing, but I constantly end up with a read-only fs. Has anyone had this kind of problem with latest revisions? Older firmware images still work perfectly. U-boot is version 1.1.5. I did read the postings in this thread, but couldn&#039;t find something related to this, so maybe it&#039;s a new bug since the change of the scripts doing the switch to jffs2? Any ideas?</p><p>[Update: got it working with a jffs-only file system ... but no change with squashfs]</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lbcd</strong> on 1 Mar 2010, 00:39)</p>

					<p>@vincentfox: I did read the whole thread at least 2 times. I`ve tried almost everything (the only option left for me is jtag cable, but as you know there isn`t any information about this procedure). I will try to explain and describe everything one more time and after that if there`s still no result I`ll consider buying new unit and toss the old one in the garbage. When I flashed my unit, I did it not only because my curiosity but also because of the crappy stock firmware. I compiled an image from trunk - r19347 with wrt160nl profile, luci interface, print server (p910n), samba sharing, and transmission client. After that I flashed it via linksys web interface, and I was able to configure the router via luci web interface. While i was setting up router`s ip address the web interface stopped responding. I wasn`t able to connect my lan and wlan via dhcp. 1st thing i`ve tried was failsafe mode. Passwd not working, mount_root not working, mtd - r erase nvram not working, so nothing. <a href="http://img444.imageshack.us/i/screenshotg.png/"><span class="postimg"><img src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/4846/screenshotg.th.png" alt="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/4846/screenshotg.th.png" /></span></a><br />S.o. told me that if I have working failsafe i don`t need the serial - wrong.</p><p>The second thing I did was to buy CA-42 cable. I found the correct wires and connected them directly to the router`s board. There`s output but no input. I decided that I have to buy something better then this cable so I spent some more time and money looking for FTDI cable. Now I`ve got FTDI board but the result is the same. Meanwhile I cut my ca-42 shorter (3 times) and now is about 10cm - no result. 20 min ago i connected the router with serial cable using lan 4 (not the pins on the board) - same result as before - output is fine but there`s no input. I`ve tried agress`s trick with the ground cable - not working. The only way to get ar7100&gt; is to short tx and rx cables while booting so i can stop the uboot process but after tat there`s still no input.</p><p>So, guys, I just wanna know if I`m really doing something wrong or I just have to give up.&nbsp; And I know you don`t have to deal with my problems cuz it`s not your fault, but obviously I don`t have anyone else to ask. I`m just really disappointed from linksys support. So many firmware issues and they do nothing.10x in advance and I guess this is the last time I`m disturbing you with my annoying questions. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I`ll provide some more information.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.5 (Apr  6 2009 - 13:54:11)

Does your PC use modem control signals on the serial port? Maybe this is preventing sending data to the router. To check this out, just connect the TX line of the cable to the RX line of the cable on the side where you usually would connect the router and then type something. Does it appear in your comm program?</p>									</div>
