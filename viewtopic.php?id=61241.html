					<p>Hi All, I was given a bricked WRT1900AC. The owner flashed an OpenWRT image to it, unaware that the ALT partition had a bad memory block. It wouldn&#039;t reset itself to factory firmware because the recovery flag wasn&#039;t set. So I got this device.</p><p>I connected the serial console and flipped it to load off boot_part 1. That didn&#039;t work fully but it did try to run the factory firmware. I made a note of specific errors but that&#039;s not why I&#039;m posting.</p><p>I have a TFTP server set up in the same subnet as the router but I can&#039;t transfer a file. There isn&#039;t even a ping either way. There&#039;s some recognition on the PC that the Ethernet cable has been plugged in to the router. It starts up particular daemons.</p><p>I&#039;m about to give up on this, assuming that it has multiple hardware faults. I can&#039;t think of anything that would help except maybe download an image via the serial console (kermit, xmodem or ymodem). I might need help with the flash command though.</p><p>That aside, I thought I&#039;d give others the chance to suggest something</p><p>J.</p>									</div>

					<p>Solved one problem - the TFTP server wasn&#039;t ready.</p><p>So I can now transfer a file to either partition and boot off either partition. With regard to the bad block in NAND memory I had to move the ALT partition so that it started just after the bad block. To do this</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; setenv alt_kern_addr 0x33e0000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; savenv</p><p>(Normal value is 0x3200000, so I&#039;ve only lost a little bit of memory there)</p><p>I flashed factory firmware to both partitions. It fails in the same way that it did when I first tried booting factory firmware. It gets as far as &quot;Starting smbd ...&quot; and hangs. There isn&#039;t a web gui at this point. And it won&#039;t respond to ping. I could look into that further but there&#039;s more information.</p><p>I flashed an OpenWRT image v 15.05 to the ALT partition. This has a problem too, resulting in a kernel panic. The last few messages in the console before that are</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Function entered at [&lt;c03a4900&gt;] from [&lt;00008074&gt;]<br />&nbsp; r9:562f5842 r8:0000406a r7:c03de3d4 r6:c03cd5bc r5:c03db07c r4:c03fd264<br />&nbsp; ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0,0) 7942] pci 0000:00:03.0: BAR 8: assigned [mem 0xf8400000-0xf85fffff]</p><p>There are 5 more lines after that relating to pci but not error messages. Then the device hangs.</p><p>I recall that the factory firmware complains about a block but I don&#039;t have that onscreen at the moment. If it helps diagnose this problem I can get it.</p><p>Actually, there&#039;s an earlier error in the OpenWRT log and a clue as to the prolem. When OpenWRT is creating MTD partitions it&#039;s still trying to place kernel2 at address 0x320&#039;0000.</p><p>And just before that<br />&nbsp; nand_read_bbt: bad block at 0x000003380000</p><p>Is there a way to make it avoid the bad block ?</p><p>Would OpenWRT run satisfactorily in the PRI partition ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Got a bit further with this by booting factory firmware on the PRI partition.</p><p>On one occasion I managed to get a Welcome screen off the web server interface. I noticed that, at that point the serial console had one extra line in the boot log. I&#039;d just left it sitting there for quite a long time after it got to this point<br />&nbsp; Starting smbd ....</p><p>I haven&#039;t reproduced this yet.</p><p>Some other things to note. This device has the antennae removed at the moment, as well as the front (blue) part of the case. Also the two front feet.</p><p>I have a feeling that if you leave the device in that position, it can lead to an overheating problem. If anything stick the front up in the air, obviously on something non-conductive.</p><p>In the other position I started getting gibberish on the console. But that problem has gone now. It&#039;s a pretty warm day so I wouldn&#039;t expect to see this issue all of the time.</p><p>But if this device will boot factory firmware from the PRI partition, that gives me more confidence to try OpenWRT on the same partition.</p><p>That bad block is probably going to scupper any attempt to use the ALT partition unless I recompile OpenWRT, I suspect.</p><p>If someone can confirm, that would be great.</p>									</div>

					<p>Noted. Thanks. Not an easy recovery that though.</p><p>There&#039;s a bit more to this story which I hadn&#039;t realised because I didn&#039;t completely remove the case (just the blue part at the front).</p><p>I just happened to peer through the ventilation holes on the top and I noticed a fan. And guess what ? It&#039;s not running. I&#039;m pretty sure this explains all of the symptoms.</p><p>It&#039;s possible that more than the NVRAM has been lightly cooked. And that probably happened when the original owner had it.</p><p>I checked the wiki to see if it describes how to remove the remainder of the case. No go. I might take it off with a hammer. Haha.</p><p>Is it the CPU with the fan on top of it ?</p>									</div>

					<p>The fan normally doesn&#039;t run unless it is under full load. So i wouldn&#039;t worry to much about the fan.</p>									</div>
