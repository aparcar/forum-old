					<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I&#039;v tried to separate my wireless network from the ethernet one... this seems to work correctly but i still have a few problems with dnsmasq.</p><p>1-resolution work fine for dhcp clients (*.lan) but i can&#039;t get the openwrt to be resolved as openwrt.lan (nslookup on a win xp reports the server as &quot;Unknown&quot;).</p><p>1(bis)-As the openwrt has two local ips (one for wifi and one for lan) is there a way to get the right one for the network on wich the dns query has been made.</p><p>2-I don&#039;t want the wireless network to have access to anything else so is it possible to simply remove the gatway from the dhcp configuration for wireless.</p><p>Thanks for turning my linksys into one of this linux boxes i love!!!</p><p>OK... little update (not much answer till now)</p><p>So i found something upon this gateway question... simply set the dhcp options...</p><p>so in /etc/dnsmasq.conf<br />-----<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#i&#039;ve identified the wifi network by dhcp-range=wifi,...
dhcp-options=wifi,3,0</code></pre></div><p>-----</p><p>The only problem is for my win xp how gets the subnet mask 255.0.0.0...</p><p>I thought supressing the gateway was the clean way to separate the wireless network... maybe i will look at iptables and netfilters to firwall the wireless network.</p>									</div>
