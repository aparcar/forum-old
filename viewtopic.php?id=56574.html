					<p>Hey</p><p>Have a problem I hope you maybe can help me with.<br />My dad tried to Upgrade his Zyxel NBG6716 Router, using this guide at: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zyxel/zyxel_nbg6716.">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/zyxel/zyxel_nbg6716.</a><br />After installation it worked, and he was able to connect via 192.168.1.1 as it should be.<br />Then he just turn the switch on the side, and wanted to move the router to another room, where it is normally operating from. Heres starts the problems. When he turns it on, it do not work. No communication. Now i have tried to connect via. the routers serial port TTL, to see whats going on. I now see alot of faults at boot.</p><p>When it normally starts, it goes like this: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d6oczpgu28e72a3/1.txt?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/d6oczpgu28e72a3/1.txt?dl=0</a></p><p>When i try using a tftp connection, it can´t find anything: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/89catdb6lgydx33/2.txt?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/89catdb6lgydx33/2.txt?dl=0</a></p><p>Have remembered 192.168.1.33 / 255.255.255.0 as server machine. Tried with 3 PCs ( Win8, Win7 and Winxp )<br />The file I am trying to tftp is also named ras.bin</p><p>If i hit any key at boot, when the countdown shows, it gives me these possibilities: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/89catdb6lgydx33/2.txt?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/89catdb6lgydx33/2.txt?dl=0</a></p><p>Don´t know if this is usefull information, but wanna give it anyway <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Have anyone got a glue what to do, or do you thing the router is bricked?</p><p>At last - when it is powered off, a lot of the leds in front is operation, but when it turns on, they all go out and only turns on power and whatever port i used.</p><p>// Hansenfiks</p>									</div>

					<p>The bootlog you posted is the same kernel as the OEM one posted in the wiki, which tells me the openwrt didn&#039;t &quot;take.&quot; Perhaps you erased or damaged another partition when attempting the upgrade and that is preventing you from booting. You can probably recover by reflashing in TFTP mode as stated in the wiki. Try recovering with a stock firmware file.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 1 Apr 2015, 05:30)</p>

					<p>@reinob<br />Don´t know how he did it, other that he had used SSH. He only said he followed the guide.</p><p>@drawz<br />That was the first thing I thought of. But as described, is it not possible to TFTP - It cannot find ras.bin on internal LAN using TFTP. It looks like eth0 isn´t configured correctly from kernel.</p>									</div>

					<p>@hansenfiks,</p><p>The only advice I can give is to try with tftp again. From you log it does seem like U-boot is trying to download ras.bin from 192.168.1.33 via tftp.</p><p>Don&#039;t know about Windows. But with Linux you have a number of options. I have used tftp-hpa before (for flashing a NAS), but have no experience with the router. (And I honestly lack the &quot;motivation&quot; to try it with the risk of bricking it..)</p><p>If you&#039;re using a Windows tftp server, I&#039;d expect it would at least show if something is happening (i.e. if the router is actually trying to get ras.bin) and what the problem may be (perhaps a permissions problem).</p><p>Good luck, and do keep us (me) posted.</p>									</div>

					<p>@reinob<br />Tried with Raspbian. But same result. Uses: tftp -i 192.168.1.1 put ras.bin from prompt and have tried with different tftp Gui.<br />It also awaits the router til &quot;collect&quot; the file, but it doesen´t happen. Now it would be a nice feature, if the USB was able to send the file... </p><p>Must admit - i do not know much about Zyxel and their routers. I usually use Asus myself ( have a AC68U ).</p>									</div>
