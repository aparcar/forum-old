					<p>You didn&#039;t say how your AP&#039;s on the current TP link is setup...<br />two possible solutions<br />- Routed AP, quick and easy, but roaming might be a little slow as it gets a new IP<br />- AP bridged to vlan, better solution but a little more complicated to setup if you are not familiar with vlans etc..</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, sorry about that.</p><p>Current it&#039;s the quick &#039;n dirty: two SSID&#039;s created on one radio, one bridged with eth1.1 (lan side), second guest ssid is only allowed traffic to the internet. Input blocked off on the second except for the necessary parts (dhcp/dns).</p><p>The solution i was looking at right now was indeed AP bridged to vlan - I admit i&#039;m not really familiar with it safe for the theory behind it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> Especially when it comes to configuring this in openwrt. </p><p>I&#039;ve been reading up on it, seems i need the 802.1q module(?), and then adding an additional vlan for each ssid, and tagging this on the cpu port and one other port - doing this on both sides, and adding the new vlan in the interface setup ?</p>									</div>

					<p>There is nothing software wise to add, it&#039;s all part of the kernel.<br />You already have configured a vlan: &quot;eth1.1&quot;, so a new vlan interface would be creating &quot;eth1.5&quot; for example, and bridging it with the guest ssid, then assigning it to a guest firewall zone.</p>									</div>

					<p>Generally you want to leave the external Ethernet ports UNtagged.&nbsp; Tagging a port is for running multiple VLANs over the same Ethernet cable.&nbsp; You then need a managed switch on the other end to pull them out.</p><p>Which is more complicated than it needs to be here, just configure the 825 as a dumb AP as all traffic on the cable to it will already be guest restricted.&nbsp; Plugging it into that one particular port which is assigned to the different internal VLAN will put it into the guest LAN instead of the regular LAN.&nbsp; You can test this with a wired PC.</p><p>Setting both guest AP&#039;s the same SSID should allow guests to move seamlessly from one to the other, since the DHCP server will remember them.</p>									</div>

					<p>mk24 is partially correct, in this case though you DO have another managed switch (the second wireless AP running OpenWRT) which you can connect. The tricky part of this is understanding how the VLANs work and how you can test the setup. If you know what you&#039;re doing this is not a difficult problem on OpenWRT, I have done it many times, but if you&#039;re new to VLANs and OpenWRT switch configuration it will be a bit of a challenge the first time around.</p><p>You want to bridge each SSID on your main router to a separate subinterface of the CPU port (each representing a different VLAN) so that you can configure two separate physical LAN ports as untagged connections to each of the SSIDs. I would suggest actually doing that and hooking a computer up to each port to test and verify that you can access each network separately (by seeing the different IP address ranges assigned) but that traffic is not allowed between them.</p><p>Once you have wired access to both your main and guest networks working you then want to pick a port which will connect to your secondary AP. You&#039;ll change the configuration so that each VLAN is sent as &quot;tagged&quot; to that port and no VLANs are set to &quot;untagged&quot; on that port. Your CPU port must also be &quot;tagged&quot; which will require adjusting your network settings on your router and setting a router IP on each sub-interface (each VLAN) if you have not done that already.</p><p>You&#039;ll essentially configure the switch on the secondary AP the same way. Create a VLAN for each network first (the VLAN numbers must be the same as on your main router) and then on the port which will connect to your main router set each VLAN to &quot;tagged.&quot; Just as on the main router you&#039;ll also need to have the CPU port set to &quot;tagged&quot; and have IP addresses (which are different than the IPs on your main router) set on the sub-interfaces. The rest of the router and wireless configuration on the secondary unit is very similar to the first unit (don&#039;t forget to switch off the DHCP service on here though, addresses should come from the main unit).</p>									</div>
