					<p>I just installed OpenWRT White Russian RC6 and I&#039;m still playing with it. I&#039;m not too familiar with all this networking stuff, I&#039;m pretty much learning by configuring OpenWRT, and I&#039;m having some trouble with bittorrent accesibility.<br />This is my current setup:</p><p>DSL line----&gt;DLink DSL-500G Modem/Router------&gt;Linksys WRT54GL (White Russian RC6)------&gt;Slackware 10.2 box</p><p>First of all, I managed to put my DLink in bridged mode, and to redirect everything to 10.1.1.2 (which is how it sees the Linksys).<br />I&#039;ve configured PPPoE on the Linksys, and I can access the internet, everything is OK.<br />Also, I&#039;ve configured DHCP on the Linksys, to serve IPs to my network, and I&#039;ve also created a rule to always assign 192.168.1.135 to my Slackware box.<br />I have activated QoS on the Linksys, but I&#039;m using the default configuration.<br />Lastly, I have created some firewall accept/forward rules both at the Webif (x-wrt) and by editing the file directly (firewall.user, if I&#039;m not mistaken), accepting and forwarding the ports to 192.168.1.135 (Slack box). But all this filters are kind of irrelevant right now, see below.</p><p>The problem is, some bittorrent sites are now reporting me as Firewalled, and in fact, all of my connections to other peers are local (outgoing).<br />I have disabled iptables on the Slack box, and I also temporarily disabled OpenWRT&#039;s firewall (S35firewall stop, is that right?), but nothing changed.</p><p>As I understand it, I could have 3 possible places where the ports are closed: the Dlink, the Linksys, and the Slack box. Like I said before, I have (or at least thought I had), disabled all blocking in all 3 devices. So, I&#039;d like to try to test each of the connections, to try to find out exactly where it&#039;s being blocked.</p><p>1 - Is there any program for OpenWRT that I can use to test if XXX ports are accesible from the outside? This way, I could find out if there&#039;s still any blocking going on at the Dlink.</p><p>2 - Also, is there a way to test the ports between the Linksys and my box?</p><p>3 - Lastly, is it possible that QoS is somehow blocking bittorrent?</p><p>I understand that there&#039;s the possibility that my problem is not OpenWRT related, but mostly I want to try to test the connectivity from World-&gt;OpenWRT and from OpenWRT-&gt;MyPC.</p>									</div>

					<p>Why dont you remove the DLink doohickey and properly configure your WRT? </p><p>1.)<br />If you give me your IP and the port (maybe via PM) I could test it for you or have a look at <a href="http://www.derkeiler.com/Service/PortScan/">http://www.derkeiler.com/Service/PortScan/</a></p><p>2.)<br />If your DLink is in bridged Mode it is working on a different ISO/OSI Layer and therefor cannot block any ports. So this can be excluded.</p><p>3.)<br />Please send the output of &quot;iptables -L&quot; from your slack and openwrt installation. Regarding QoS I would first start of with the basics and when everything is fine go over to QoS</p><p>Regs,<br />Matze</p>									</div>

target     prot opt source               destination</code></pre></div><p>I have messed with a lot of stuff, but the ports that really matter here are 55000:55010 (I use those for bittorrent).<br />I have mostly tried to add accept and forward rules for these specific ports (both source and destination), and those are the ports that I kept testing.</p><p>Basically, i have one UDP and one TCP for every rule. Do I need to do that? I&#039;m thinking that maybe if I don&#039;t specify the protocol it&#039;ll be good for both. Can I do that?</p><p>Here&#039;s one thing that&#039;s a little confusing for me: what&#039;s the difference between forwarding_wan and forwarding_rule (the same goes for input_*). Are the &quot;_rule&quot;s used for the internal LAN and &quot;_wan&quot;s for WAN only? If so, how should I deal with it? Do I need to have one instance of every rule for the WAN and one for the LAN?</p><p>Aside from that, I&#039;d really appreciate any other tips for cleaning up my iptables rules.</p><p>Oh, and another thing. When I want to use bittorrent (or any other open port needing app) on 2 machines on my LAN, should I:<br />A - use a different set of ports for the other machine and have iptables forward those ports to that machine<br />B - Use the same ports, and have iptables forward those ports to both machines, OpenWRT will know which traffic belongs to each<br />C - ?</p><p>Thanks again</p>									</div>
