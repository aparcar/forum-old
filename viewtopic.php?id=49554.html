					<p>Hi,</p><p>i did a search in the forum but did not find what i was looking for ( although i found other interesting topics), so open a new post for this.</p><p>I&#039;m running OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r39930 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r9961) on a TP-Link WR1043ND, i managed to install the luci-app-openvpn and setup two OpenVPN client and one OpenVPN server connections.</p><p>The OpenVPN clients route all traffic via the VPN servers and the OpenVPN server is connected via the normal ISP network.<br />I&#039;m looking for a solution to balance traffic between the two client connections ( mwan3 ?) but this is a different matter.</p><br /><p>All works fine so far, but as soon as one of the OpenVPN client connections become active, the connection to the OpenVPN server drops and cannot be reestablished anymore.</p><p>I see the remote client coming in, but the OpenVPN connection to the server cannot be established.I assume that the replies from the server are now routed through the Router&#039;s OpenVPN client connection to the VPN provider, so the reply goes a different way then the request and also come then from a different public IP address ( that one from the VPN ).</p><p>The clients use a tcp connection, the server uses UDP.</p><p>The OpenVPN clients are in a separate firewall zone which is setup the same way like the default wan zone ( masquerading),<br />the OpenVPN server is in a separate zone as well, but can forward packets to and from lan zone.</p><p>Since the routing changes as soon as a client connection from the router is active, i suspect it has to do with the routing as outlined above.</p><p>I tried to add a net route for the remote client connecting to my server, but didn&#039;t help.</p><p>How can i make the client and server work simultaneous ?</p><br /><br /><br /><p>regards,</p><p>twelvekit</p>									</div>

					<p>I took a network trace on the OpenWRT router and this confirmed my suspection.The P_ACK_V1 replies to the client&#039;s P_CONTROL_HARD_RESET_CLIENT_V2 requests from the OpenVPN server goes out via the OpenVPN client connection.</p><p>That&#039;s obviously because the OpenVPN client connection sets the default route to itself once the connection is established.</p><p>So how can i route the OpenVPN server&#039;s replies via the wan connection instead via the OpenVPN client connection ?</p><p>In other words, i need an exception for the default routing:</p><p>WAN &lt;===&gt; LAN UDP port 1194</p><p>I&#039;ve seen quite a few postings here dealing with this ( like bypass VPN for game client), but still no idea how to implement this.</p><br /><p>Any help appreciated....</p><p>regards,</p><p>twelvekit</p>									</div>

					<p>I just added a host route to the remote OpenVPN client and now all works as expected.Of course this is not a real solution to the problem as it&#039;s not feasible to add a host route as i cannot do this from remote.</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to find a solution to this problem, it&#039;s working now fine.As it might help others i will outline it here.</p><p>What is the issue ?</p><p>When running a OpenVPN server and OpenVPN client on the same device, the OpenVPN server becomes unreachable once the VPN client connection is up.This is because the OpenVPN server&#039;s reply to the remote client is routed via the OpenVPN client connection, so it arrives from a whole different IP address at the client, so the remote client cannot establish connection.</p><p>What is the solution ?</p><p>Selectively route the packets coming from the OpenVPN server listening port via normal internet connection, not through the VPN channel.In my case the OpenVPN server is listening on UDP port 1194 ( and thus replying from this port).</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>eth0.2: the WAN interface
192.168.1.1 : the default GW on WAN interface

# create a new routing table, name and number doesn&#039;t matter ( do cat before to check what numbers are used)
echo &#039;500   openvpn&#039; &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables  

# mark all packets going out from udp port 1194 with mark 1 ( can use any mark number as long as it&#039;s not used yet)
iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT -p udp --sport 1194 -j MARK --set-mark 1  

# add an ip rule, all packets marked with mark 1 use routing table &quot;openvpn&quot;
ip rule add fwmark 1 table openvpn 

# add a default gw to the table &quot;openvpn&quot;, this is your normal internet connection default GW.
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0.2 table openvpn </code></pre></div><p>I tried also </p><p>iptables -A PREROUTING -t mangle -p udp --sport 1194 -j MARK --set-mark 1</p><p>but this didn&#039;t work for an unknown reason.So in theory either variant should work, you may try out both. </p><br /><p>regards,</p><p>twelvekit</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>twelvekit</strong> on 17 Mar 2014, 23:52)</p>
