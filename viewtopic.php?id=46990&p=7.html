					<p>Hi to all,<br />I hope someone can help me...</p><p>I bought a TL-WA901ND V3 after consulting the OpenWRT-Page. There I read that V3.x is supported. I was able to flash both, the stable and the trunk release on my device and get it up and running on Wireless. But I was only able to set up 2.4GHz WLAN with phy0/radio0. I am not able to set up a second phy/radio on 5GHz. What I’m doing wrong? Or is there no support for 5GHz? I tried it on CLI-Interface and tied iw info which only gives infos about 2.4GHz Channels </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>When you say &quot;use as a router&quot; the conventional use case is to connect the Ethernet port to a network device that goes to the Internet, and route users from wifi to the Internet.</p><p>A device with one Ethernet port should still have a wan network and firewall zone configured by default, just with no hardware connected to them.</p><p>Enable the wifi AP.&nbsp; By default you have one unsecured AP connected to LAN, but it is disabled.&nbsp; If you have any neighbors it would be a good idea to secure it.<br />Disconnect the Ethernet cable and connect to the router by wifi.&nbsp; &nbsp;Log in again.<br />In the Network-- LAN -- Physical settings, unselect the Ethernet port.<br />In Network -- WAN -- Physical settings, select the Ethernet port.<br />Plug the Ethernet into your network which is connected to the Internet.&nbsp; It will by default acquire an address by DHCP.&nbsp; If this is not what you need, change the WAN protocol.<br />If the WAN IP is in the range 192.168.1.x you need to change the LAN from 192.168.1.1 to something else like 192.168.y.1 where y is not 1.</p>									</div>
