					<p>After uploading the openwrt firmware to the router, it cannot be accessed through telnet or a web browser. The router is not bricked as I can reopen the OEM firmware installation dialogue easily and get it back to the official firmware in a working state.</p><p>I am attempting to install openwrt onto my D-Link DSL-2740B C3 with the intention of using it in a wifi bridge.<br />The hardware is supported as on this wiki page:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dsl-2740b">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dsl-2740b</a></p><p>Following the directions for OEM easy installation, I downloaded the 3 firmware .bin files from the directory<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm63xx/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm63xx/</a><br />openwrt-DSL2740B-jffs2-128k-cfe.bin<br />openwrt-DSL2740B-jffs2-64k-cfe.bin<br />openwrt-DSL2740B-squashfs-cfe.bin</p><p>and the D-Link firmware from:<br /><a href="http://www.dlink.com.au/tech/Download/download.aspx?product=DSL-2740B">http://www.dlink.com.au/tech/Download/d … =DSL-2740B</a><br />AUS_DSL-2740B_4.15b363.bin</p><p>Then I turned the router off and booted it with a a pin on the reset button. Acessing the page <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>/ while connected I used the dialogue to upload the first openwrt firmware (squashfs, as it was reccomended). The router seemed to install the firmware and restarted. Opening the web page of the default gateway returned unable to connect and telnet gave no route to host.</p><p>Thinking it was bricked, I returned to the official firmware, and it ran fine, so I tried the other three firmwares, and all gave the same result.</p><p>Could someone kindly tell me where I am going wrong?</p>									</div>

					<p>Can you try the trunk images? Note that they don&#039;t contain luci, so you have to install it through telnet/ssh.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>1st of all you only need openwrt-DSL2740B-squashfs-cfe.bin and not the others.<br />2nd thing is that by default the &#039;web interface&#039; or the GUI is not installed, this is called Luci and should be installed using telnet and opkg.</p><p>so do the following:<br />1. Flash the router with openwrt-DSL2740B-squashfs-cfe.bin.<br />2. Set your ip to manually be 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0<br />3. Telnet to 192.168.1.1</p><p>Now comes the harder part, which is to manually configure the interfaces thru terminal (telnet) until you are able to connect online, once online you can do the following:<br />4. opkg update<br />5. opkg install luci</p><p>once luci is install you should reboot the router and you can now access the web interface by typing 192.168.1.1 in your fav. browser.</p><p>again these are only high level instructions so you understand the process.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve spent around 3 hours to install the openWRT on this device, and to avoid further unnecessary confusion, I&#039;m writing this tiny tutorial for those who own the same router as mine. My DSL-2740B has a C3 firmware version.</p><p>Prerequisite firmware:<br />C3 &quot;trunk&quot; from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm63xx/openwrt-DSL274XB-C3-squashfs-cfe.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … fs-cfe.bin</a><br />or<br />C2 &quot;trunk&quot; from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/brcm63xx/openwrt-DSL274XB-C2-squashfs-cfe.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … fs-cfe.bin</a></p><p>For fail-save firmware, I used the one downloaded from <a href="ftp://files.dlink.com.au/products/DSL-2740B/">ftp://files.dlink.com.au/products/DSL-2740B/</a> </p><p>The only reason I spent hours on installing is that I failed to login using the C3 version, while the C2 version works like a charm. So if you have the same problem as mine, try the C2 version instead.</p><p>PuTTY for the telnet session: <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgta … nload.html</a></p><p>For D-Link DSL-2740B C3 installation methods:</p><p>1. I&#039;m not sure if this is necessary step, but I first do the Factory Reset on the original firmware, under the Advance / Maintenance tab.</p><p>2. Power off the router, and using a pin gently press the reset button at the rear. Power on the router now and keep pressing the reset button until the power indicator turn the color from orange to red. Then you may release the reset button. Plug in your ethernet cable and connect it to your computer if it&#039;s not connected yet. (Yes, the firmware is uploaded while the power indicator light still red, so don&#039;t restart the router. And no, you would not be able to use the update firmware menu on the regular web interface, because it will simply tell you the firmware is outdated blablabla...) </p><p>3. Change your computer IP address manually to 192.168.1.2, netmask: 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.1.1. Then using your fave browser open the page to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a><br />Choose the downloaded firmware, and upload it to your router.<br />Leave it for around 2 minutes until you will see the router reboots. No need to disconnect the ethernet cable during these process.</p><p>4. Wait for the reboot process to finish (power indicator green light stable, not blinking anymore). Use PuTTY to &quot;telnet&quot; into your router, the address would be 192.168.1.1<br />If it fails you to connect via telnet, first try to power off and on the device and wait 2-3 minutes then try again.<br />If it still fails to connect, then repeat procedure number 2 and 3 with the C2 version of the firmware. Chances are it will work like mine.<br />If you want to revert back to the original firmware, exactly do the same thing as number 2 and 3, while choosing the original firmware to be uploaded.<br />It&#039;s that easy and practically I think it&#039;s a minimum chance you would brick this device, since you can always have the engineering page to reupload the original firmware.</p><p>For the post installation stuffs, you may go on and have a further reading on the forum.<br />The only hassle is that when your router don&#039;t have the internet connection to download the rest of the packages to make the router works the way you want it. (I don&#039;t have a DSL line, so I&#039;m downloading the packages manually and installing it offline now.)</p><p>That&#039;s it. Have fun.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>cumisquid</strong> on 23 Feb 2014, 12:28)</p>

					<p>Thanks, cumisquid, it&#039;s been a while but I still haven&#039;t bothered to get a new router.</p><p>Followed your method and got it running finally.</p><p>Had to laugh when I realised after all this time there&#039;s not support ADSL2+ so I can&#039;t use it as a modem. Good for a bridge and nice to have open software but it&#039;s probably about time for some new hardware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drosophila</strong> on 11 Dec 2014, 18:01)</p>
