					<p>Hmm, your IPv6 address is awfully similar to the one TelecomItalia gives out.

					<p>Thank you for the replies!<br />Yes, I am trying to use the native connectivity provided by Telecom Italia <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />The odd fact is that, when the problem occurs, nothing is logged, so it is difficult to find out what is happening. Moreover, it happens at random times, and there does not seem to be a timeout underneath.</p>									</div>
