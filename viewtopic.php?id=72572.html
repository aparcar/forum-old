					<p>Hello,</p><p>We are using SOM9331 module and we need to receive the data over uart. We have disabled the Kernel message, the necessary packages for serial port are installed.</p><p>We are able to receive the data in /dev/ttyATH0, the data received need to be saved in text file. The data saved in text file will be used to display on web pages which we have developed.</p><p>Can anyone let me know how we can save the UART data to text file. We used CAT command but there are 2 issues, 1. Data is getting appended where as we need the data to be overwritten.&nbsp; <br />2. Using CAT command, the file is not getting closed, even if we add CTRL+Z at the end of script.</p><p>The script needs to be continuously running as the data may come any time.&nbsp; </p><p>Thanks,<br />Sreekanth</p>									</div>
