					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have particular requirement where I need to get a Kismet drone to periodically upload its data file to a linux based NAS Server on the LAN.</p><p>I was thinking of using the SCP command however I noticed the OpenWRT release doesn&#039;t have something like &quot;expect&quot; so I would appreciate if anyone has any ideas.</p><p>The difficulty is because we are installing these drones with automatic scripts its difficult to do the whole private key dance so getting those installed will be difficult.</p><p>Essentially I need &quot;NODE A&quot; to SCP it&#039;s file(s) to the NAS Server silently.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>T</p>									</div>

					<p>See if &#039;empty&#039; can be a replacement for &#039;expect&#039; in your case:</p><p>empty &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.6.18b-1 &nbsp; &nbsp; empty is an utility that provides an interface to execute and/or interact with processes under pseudo-terminal sessions (PTYs). This tool is definitely useful in programming of shell scripts designed to communicate with interactive programs like telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. In some cases, empty can be the simplest replacement for TCL/expect or other similar programming tools.</p><p><a href="http://empty.sourceforge.net/">http://empty.sourceforge.net/</a><br /><a href="http://www.linuxcertif.com/man/1/empty/">http://www.linuxcertif.com/man/1/empty/</a> -&gt; links to &#039;expect&#039; in the &quot;see also&quot; section</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 28 May 2015, 20:39)</p>

					<p>empty showed great promise but is one of the most flakiest pieces of software I have ever used. Worked for 5 minutes and then just refused to work or do anything short of rebooting the Open-Mesh device there didn&#039;t seem any way of reviving it.</p><p>For anyone interested however found this useful resource relating to empty:</p><p><a href="http://www.linuxcertif.com/man/1/empty/">http://www.linuxcertif.com/man/1/empty/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Since you write LAN, perhaps you don&#039;t worry about security:</p><p>You can use netcat (nc):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>server # nc -l -p 9999 &gt; file.txt
(waiting for connection)

client # nc server 9999 &lt; file.txt
(connecting and sending file)</code></pre></div><p>The server listen thing you can put in a little loop:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

echo &gt; /tmp/keeplistinforfile

while [Â -f /tmp/keeplistenforfile ]
do
  nc -l -p 9999 &gt; file.txt
done</code></pre></div><p>You may need to install &quot;real&quot; netcat (nc) on OpenWrt. The nc that comes with busybox is limited.</p><p>...perphaps this did not help at all...</p>									</div>
