					<p>Porting for a new model is a very advanced topic.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to try to start there.</p><p>Again I suggest if you don&#039;t want to buy an already supported router, you can build one out of cast-off PC parts from the mid 1990s to early 2000s, that every hacker usually has laying around.&nbsp; Install an x86 build and study how it works.</p>									</div>

					<p>No one here tries to modify manufacturer&#039;s firmware.&nbsp; The whole point of OpenWrt is to erase the manufacturer&#039;s firmware and completely replace it.</p><p>In OpenWrt if you want to change a logo or a bit of text or something, there are two approaches. </p><p>First you can do it while the router is running by going into the filesystem and changing a file.&nbsp; This is almost never possible on manufacturer firmware because it won&#039;t let you have a command prompt and even if it did, the filesystem is read-only.</p><p>The other way is to modify it in the source code then build a new binary image and install it on the router.&nbsp; This is seldom possible on manufacturer firmware because they won&#039;t give you the source code. No one here tries to break up a binary firmware image and modify something and put it back together, because the source code for OpenWrt is available.</p>									</div>
