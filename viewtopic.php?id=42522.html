					<p>1) so I&#039;ve to have ssh server installed and configured way that it&#039;d have set router as known host. <br />2)And another point is that I build opkg form source everyhin OK but when I type opkg - it said command not found ( I assume first I need to ssh into router and then it works = the opkg command)</p>									</div>

					<p>My advice as a beginner myself in OpenWRT:</p><p>If you&#039;re new to OpenWRT and/or linux,<br />- forget about compiling an image by yourself<br />- especially forget about compiling a trunk image</p><p>Both are only suitable for advanced users, who know what they&#039;re doing, who do not stumble over every tiny error and who can help themselves.</p><p>Instead, for the first steps with OpenWRT, go the easy and safe way: Install a *precompiled image* or generate (not compile) one by yourself with help of the image generator.<br />---&gt; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware</a> ---&gt; see 1) + 2)</p><p>To my experience, this is much easier, less error prone and *will work*.</p><p>With the precompiled image, you can play around, install available packages, get to know OpenWRT and it&#039;s configurations, learn how things work.</p><p>With precompiled images, you will have opkg installed by default and it will work.</p><p>By the way: Why do you want to &quot;hack&quot; your router? What&#039;s your goal you want to achieve? What do you want to do with OpenWRT?</p><p>P.S.: You have to be forgiving and wakeful with *all* open source firmware project documentation, not just OpenWRT, since developers like to develop, but not to document (I totally understand this; I would act the same way <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. Much of the information you find on the net refers to old versions of OpenWRT and may not be applicable to your specific build.</p>									</div>

					<p>Some questions:</p><p>- How old is that router?<br />- Is &quot;Pirelli discus AG v1&quot; the complete name of the router?<br />- Is there a sticker with model / maker / serial number on the router?<br />- Do you have a manual (printed or pdf) for this router?<br />- Are you sure that this router doesn&#039;t support DDNS by itself, without the need for a different DDNS?<br />- Why are you stuck to that router? Why not a router for $25 who has a builtin DDNS client, so you don&#039;t need any firmware modification?</p><p>Just curious, because you are going through all that hassle only to get a DDNS client...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 12 Mar 2013, 20:13)</p>
