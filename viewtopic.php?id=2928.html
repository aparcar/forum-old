					<p>Doesn&#039;t the non deluxe version only have USB 1.1 which means max HDD speed of 12 Mbit/s compared to USB 2.0 with 480Mbit/s theoretical max?&nbsp; </p><p>BTW, what are the transfer rates on the deluxe version with a USB flash drive or HDD... is it comparable to the speed when plugged into any other linux box, or does the speed suffer for some reason?&nbsp; </p><p>I am thinking about getting a deluxe and trying to put around a 200 GB HDD and then set it up as a network file server.&nbsp; Would this work?&nbsp; Anyone w/ the deluxe could you please speak for the abilities of the USB before I purchase?</p><p>Also another general question about the deluxe and others with USB...&nbsp; would it be possible to connect a USB wireless card so that you can effectively have two wifi&#039;s controlled by your router and could create wireless repeaters and such or connect to two wireless APs or something of that nature?&nbsp; It just seems like it would open up lots of cool possiblilities. </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
