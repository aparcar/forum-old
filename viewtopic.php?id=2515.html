					<p>To be specific, here is a slightly different vlan setup to that described, but it illustrates the problem.&nbsp; If anyone can see a problem with this then please explain:</p><p># nvram show|egrep &quot;[wl]an|dmz&quot;|sort<br />dmz_ifname=vlan2<br />dmz_proto=dhcp<br />lan_gateway=192.168.105.254<br />lan_ifname=br0<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0 vlan1 vlan2 eth1 eth2 eth3<br />lan_ipaddr=192.168.105.250<br />lan_netmask=255.255.255.0<br />lan_proto=static<br />vlan0hwname=et0<br />vlan0ports=1 2 5*<br />vlan1hwname=et0<br />vlan1ports=0 5<br />vlan2hwname=et0<br />vlan2ports=3 4 5<br />wan_ifname=vlan1<br />wan_proto=dhcp</p><p>I then added a line in S40network to do an ifup dmz, and totally removed S45firewall</p><p>This setup above works if you plug two things into any two ports, it bridges between them.&nbsp; However, if you plug a third thing into the third vlan (doesn&#039;t seem to matter what order) then networking seems to stop working.&nbsp; Unplug one thing and everything else seems to start working again.&nbsp; It&#039;s as though it gets confused what port to send/rcv on...</p><p>Can anyone explain what is wrong here (I know it&#039;s slightly different to the first question)</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually, I noticed that it all gets a lot worse when a switch is added to one of the ports.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if it might be something to do with all the interfaces having the same MAC address?</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt; Taking a default wrt54gs - it&#039;s bridged between vlan0 and vlan1 (and the wireless).&nbsp; </p><p>no, by default it&#039;s bridged between eth1 (wireless) and vlan1 (LAN). Vlan0 is wan port, what is not bridged. I dont understand, why you want to bridge several vlan&#039;s. If you need pass traffic between ethernet ports, then much simpler is put them to same vlan. All vlans in switch have same MAC address, and if you create bridge between 3 devices, and two of them have same MAC, then you be screwed anyway.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netmaster</strong> on 3 Sep 2005, 23:24)</p>

					<p>Nope, the default is definitely to bridge &quot;vlan0 vlan1 eth1 eth2 eht3&quot;</p><p>I know because I have locked myself out of this router a couple of times while upgrading and had to hold in the reset button while booting and that&#039;s basically a copy and paste from the router (which has lost all my other variables)</p><p>Anyway, that aside, the reason for doing this is that I want a device that I can use to segregate the WAN and two lan segments, but in a totally transparent way.&nbsp; Consider walking into a potential client and being able to push the transparency aspect of the firewall, ie nothing to reconfigure and if something goes wrong you just remove the firewall and it&#039;s back to normal (but unprotected of course).&nbsp; In my case I am only doing QOS, so the ability is to show the client adding and removing the device and the effect on the network without them making any other changes</p><p>What I would like is to have 5 vlans (ie each port in a seperate vlan) and to be able to apply firewall rules to each, but they are all bridged so that no reconfig is needed.</p><p>I think you are right though that the issue might be because I have the same MAC for each vlan?&nbsp; Interesting that this seems to be the default and it works fine for the default 2 vlan bridge setup.&nbsp; I will investigate how to change it and retest.&nbsp; </p><p>Please try my nvram config from above and you can repro my situation.&nbsp; I still see the original problem though that even creating three vlans and then changing the &quot;wan&quot; port to use the &quot;other&quot; vlan and the device stops working.&nbsp; So I still wonder if there isn&#039;t something special about the two original vlans which makes this work, but doesn&#039;t apply once you create new vlans...?</p>									</div>

					<p>&gt; Nope, the default is definitely to bridge &quot;vlan0 vlan1 eth1 eth2 eht3&quot;</p><p>why do you think that? <br />my WRT54G shows after reset that:</p><p>root@WRT54G:~# nvram show|grep ifnames<br />size: 8646 bytes (24122 left)<br />lan_ifnames=vlan0 eth1 eth2 eth3<br />wan_ifnames=vlan1</p><p>this means vlan0 and vlan1 is NOT bridged, vlan0 (port1-4 in switch) and eth1 (wireless) is bridged. I have no idea, what is eth2 and eth3. If vlan1 is WAN port, and vlan0 is LAN, then WRT does by default between them NAT or routing, not bridging. <br />I think this is just impossible, what you want to do because MAC issue. You need physical (ethX) interfaces not logical (vlanX) interfaces for that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>netmaster</strong> on 4 Sep 2005, 11:49)</p>
