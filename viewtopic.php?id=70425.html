					<p>I recently did a reflash on my router to fix a VPN issue. However, I now have an IPv6 WAN IP everywhere I go. When ever I go to disable my wan adapter, I (obviously) lose access to many websites.</p><p>For security purposes, I want my network to rely on IPv4 (my VPN doesn&#039;t support secure IPv6 yet).</p><p>I don&#039;t know what changed, but previously, when ever I would go to whatismyip or I googled &quot;what is my IP&quot; it was always my ipv4 ip. I compared my two configs, old and new, and the only difference was my ipv4 config ran as &#039;bridge&#039; with my ipv6 interface. I tried to do that again to see if that fixed it, but I lose all connectivity when I do that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>kocrachon</strong> on 31 Mar 2017, 11:46)</p>
