					<p>You would need to include the script and the custom cron settings in the openwrt build root folder, the best way would be to save your configuration, then extract the files to a file called files so</p><br /><p>(Openwrt trunk)&gt;&gt; Folder named files &gt;&gt; your files probably /etc/config</p><p>like this:</p><p>openwrtbuildfolder/files/etc/config</p><p>before you save your configuration you should make sure the custom files like your bash script are also backed up by including their folder in the configuration tab under backups</p>									</div>
