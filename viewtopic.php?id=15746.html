					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have been having some trouble with my D-Link DI-524 so I&#039;m looking at getting a new wireless router. As evidenced by my posting here, I am very interested in running OpenWRT on it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>According to the Table of Hardware, the ASUS WL-500g Premium V1 is listed as supported while the V2 is listed as a &quot;WiP.&quot; There isn&#039;t much information given on the wiki page for it: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Asus/WL500GPV2">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har … /WL500GPV2</a> ; I assume that if I purchase a WL-500gP it will likely be a V2, so I was wondering if anyone knows what the status is.</p><p>The ToH says to check the &quot;ports&quot; page for hardware listed as WiP, however I wasn&#039;t able to find it.. </p><p>I&#039;m looking at this particular router because it is roughly the same price (for me, anyway) as a WRT54GL, but from what I gather is more powerful (i.e. more RAM, faster proc, USB ports).</p><p>Any input would be greatly appreciated <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>-Aikon</p>									</div>

					<p>I live in Germany and&nbsp; bought two new WL-500gp a couple of weeks ago, telling the dealer to look out for V1 as far as he can, and he sold me two units that were produced just 10 days before i got them. So Asus is still producing the V1 Version you just have to look for it.</p>									</div>
