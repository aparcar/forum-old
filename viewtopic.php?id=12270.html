					<p>I have some questions on how people debug kernel issues with openwrt (if at all).</p><p>1) Has anyone actually got kgdb working?&nbsp; I saw a post relating to this from 2005 indicating that nobody has done it, but wondered if this had changed, or do people just use printk?</p><p>2) Does anyone use ksymoops?&nbsp; This is a pain to configure for cross-compilation (i.e. i386-&gt;mips) and I don&#039;t seem to be able to get it quite right.</p><p>3) How do people maintain kernel patches which are submitted to subversion?&nbsp; The procedure of checking patches into source control makes it nice and easy for the user, but how do developers deal with maintaining all these &#039;forks&#039;, or is it just &#039;the hard way&#039;?</p><p>4) I&#039;d like to make kernel source changes, and them re-build firmware, but my changes don&#039;t seem to get into the (re-built) firmware.&nbsp; Can someone tell me how I&#039;d normally achieve this without complete rebuild, expecially when my source files are in the platform-specific subdirectories and get copied over the &#039;vanilla&#039; kernel version?&nbsp; In any case, the top-level make seems to suffer from rebuilding the lzma-loader every time it&#039;s run.</p><p>thanks for any help!</p>									</div>
