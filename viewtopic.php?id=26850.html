					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am not sure if it 100% relevant, but...<br />I have much older ASUS WL-500G v1.&nbsp; Connection to provider is PPPoE (it was PPTP 3 years ago, but than they changed to PPPoE)<br />Physical interface is Ethernet (10/100).<br />I subscribed to 15Mbit Unlimited (for traffic), and I fully utilize this bandwidth.<br />Sustained transfer rate I observe (when running Torrent with appx. 1000 connections)&nbsp; is 15Mbps.<br />CPU utilization is usually below 40%, so there is a possibility for upside.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>									</div>
