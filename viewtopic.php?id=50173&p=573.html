					<p>ValCher,</p><p>the dts in swrt is the one from OpenWrt execpt for the swconfig node fixup to silence the DTC warning. The replacement will be at least a dozen patches. The difficult part is to somewhat future prof the armada-385-linksys.dtsi and organize the changes in a way the chunks remain reviewable. That&#039;s what I&#039;m up to currently.</p><p>According to nitroshifts patch I linked it&#039;s mpp47 / &amp;gpio1 15. According to your report earlier mpp44 / &amp;gpio1 12. I have yet to take out the voltmeter to verify either. Fixups like this are probably the tedious part <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>JW9014,</p><p>the vanilla kernel always used &quot;internet&quot; for the label. I&#039;m not aware of OpenWrt ever having had a patch to change this. Also OpenWrt never used DSA, so unless you made the necessary changes I doubt you used it on plain OpenWrt. As labelling it &quot;wan&quot; would have made sense chances are good that the image you tried was patched by the author.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ansuel,</p><p>maybe try the one from coreutils instead of busybox or simply reset the clock to see if this was the issue. About hardware modding, I don&#039;t have access to Linksys documentation nor have I taken the device apart to see whether the pins are reasonably identifiable or even accessible.
