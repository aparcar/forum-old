					<p>I setup a client connection between two netgear routers (WNDR 3700 &amp; 3300).

					<p>I am not sure if this would help you, but it might point you in the right direction. I successfully managed to set up a brigde with WNDR3700 (OpenWRT 10.03.1-RC6) as the base-station and WNHD3004 (original) as the brigde. I am not sure if there are other differences between the 3300 and 3004 other than the router-functionality.</p>									</div>

					<p>marstein,</p><p>Right direction? As in the physical direction of the device it self? If so both situated vertically on the stand can you tell me which way the devices should be facing each other?</p><p>Although I doubt its a signal problem as the devices are less than 5&#039; apart during the test.</p>									</div>

					<p>I did not mean it literally, just to point out that it might be done but that I was not sure if the 3300 was the right equipment for it.</p>									</div>
