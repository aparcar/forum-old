					<p>I have a couple of similar routers, namely the 799vac XTREAM (different BroadCom SoC, fancy ARM cortex stuff - bcm63138/bcm63137) and 789vac (which also runs the bcm63168 I believe - in fact the firmware suggests the 789vac and 799vac are the same thing, maybe up to some VOIP chips)</p><p>Did you have any more luck with the JTAG header? I&#039;ve hooked this up on the XTREAM and I get some gibberish in OpenOCD in terms of devices on the JTAG chain (finds 6 devices but nothing with a valid IDCODE), so I&#039;m assuming there might be some bit blocking JTAG debugging? I&#039;m not sure. </p><p>Also - how did you go about dumping the NAND? Did you de-solder and solder to a flash drive controller? </p><p>The flashing process is fairly straightforward and I do have some signed firmware dumps available unencrypted. When uploading through the web interface/doing an ISP update the router does check a signature on the firmware files to make sure they&#039;re properly signed, I&#039;m not sure if the BOOTP bootloader firmware uploader does the same thing (I could probably check).</p>									</div>

					<p>I never did have any luck with dumping the flash, but a exploit came about that allowed for root access so in the end I just used that. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67564">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67564</a></p>									</div>
