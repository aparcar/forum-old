					<p>Hi,</p><p>the sticker on the back says &quot;Ver: 1.5&quot;. When opening the case, the board reads in the lower right &quot;2050500272 Rev:1.3&quot;.</p><p>Device was bought today. Regarding the wiki entry at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</a> what does the Version/Model column actually refer to - in my case 1.5 or 1.3?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Edit: Yet another thing: the sticker on the yellow switch module reads: &quot;TL-WDR4300 VER: 1.4 [...]&quot;. They sure know how to confuse.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>TCM1</strong> on 3 Aug 2013, 00:16)</p>

					<p>I installed trunk today, went fine. The device is now serving 4 WLANs (private + guest, each in 2.4GHz and 5GHz band) bridged to two VLANs and a management VLAN all tagged over the WAN port. The 4 LAN ports are unassigned and lead nowhere.</p>									</div>
