					<p>Hi guys,<br />I have an application where I&#039;d like a USB Flash stick to auto mount and the automatically prepare the drive for use by ensuring that a particular directory is present and create it if not.</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>1. auto mount at boot or if inserted while already booted<br />2. Mount under the same mount location every time i.e. /mnt/ext_flash (anon automount mounts at /mnt/sda1 or /mnt/sda2 depending on which stick is inserted)<br />3. Check for presence of &quot;camera&quot; directory and create it if not present.</p><p>So, while anon_mount will meet requirement 1 I&#039;m not sure how to meet requirement 2. How to get it to mount any usb block device connected at the correct mount point?</p><p>With regards to requirement 3, what&#039;s the prefered method to run a script upon mounting. Should that be done with hotplug2? If you have examples great but I just need some pointers to get me over the hump on this.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Ron</p>									</div>
