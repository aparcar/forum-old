					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a question on the samba default behaviors on openwrt 12.09 release.</p><p>I have configured the samba to share a USD-HDD on my router(security = user), by default, after entering the ip address like \\192.168.1.1 on file browser, my windows client will show all samba share folders.</p><p>I won&#039;t ask username/password until I try to open any share folder.</p><p>there is another ubuntu server on the LAN. Its samba asks for username/password when trying to connet it with it ip addresss, without correct authentication it will not list share names so that the share name was protected.</p><p>How to configure the samba on the router to behavior like that? </p><p>thanks a lot!</p>									</div>
