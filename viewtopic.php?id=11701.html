					<p>Q1:<br />Is it doable to provide kernel support of dm_crypt in 2.6 kernel used by brcm47xx-2.6?<br />Or may be there is smth which would forbid having dm_crypt (and thus encrypted partitions) under openwrt? or is it simply the feature nobody requested/tried yet?</p><p>Q2:<br />if I got it correctly, kamikaze_7.07 has wireless support for broadcom chips, right?</p><p>All the questions are because: I just got WL-500G and deciding with what release (or a trunk) I should go: I have an external USB drive with encrypted partitions. I would love to have them mounted on the router. I understand that CPU might become a bottleneck but I am not looking for high speed I/O. </p><p>Thank you very mUch in advance!</p>									</div>
