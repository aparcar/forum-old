					<p><strong><span class="bbu">tl;dr</span></strong> Is it possible to install ,config and use OpenWrt firmware on a wireless router with no Ethernet connectivity? <br />(serial and WiFi working) </p><p>hi,<br />I&#039;ve got a TP-link <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/il/products/details/?model=TL-WR841N">TL-WR841N router</a> which had his Ethernet ports fried by an electric surge.<br />The router WiFi link still function, just no Ethernet connectivity of any kind.</p><p>I want to re purpose the router hardware so I can establish a serial communication over WiFi.<br />so i&#039;d like to install OpenWrt with <a href="http://ser2net.sourceforge.net">net2ser </a> in order to enable his on board serial port. </p><p>I can install OpenWrt by connecting to the router web interface through WiFi,<br />but cannot use Ethernet to login and continue with the setup afterwards. <br />1. How can I preconfig the OpenWrt image to work right out of the box (with serial and WiFi enabled)?<br />2. Is it possible to use the CLI from the serial port to transfer files an install packages?</p><p>thanks, <br /> axodus.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>axodus</strong> on 11 Feb 2013, 06:47)</p>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>flash the firmware via wifi - webinterface and finish the configuration via serial port (enable wifi and if you like install luci).</p><p>The wiki has a lot of instructions on how to get serial working and how to flash firmware via serial if bricked.</p><p>But to be clear, this is on your own risk! Flashing via wifi is not perfect but it should be possible imho.</p><p>Regards<br />Sebastian</p>									</div>

					<p>There&#039;s a workaround for enabled wifi on firstboot <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>If wifi now works, there&#039;s not even need for serial and router can be used at least like a repeater. I came across problem, where I want my wifi enabled by default, and here&#039;s a <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=191764#p191764">solution</a> from arokh.&nbsp; All you need is just to edit mac80211.sh script before compiling the image.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 12 Feb 2013, 15:58)</p>
