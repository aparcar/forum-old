					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I&#039;d like to ask your advice or insights on the following. I have a WR 0.9 on my router and now from an external location I ran some nmap tests out of curiosity.</p><p>If I run <strong>nmap &lt;host&gt;</strong> for let&#039;s say the first time, it gives back:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Not shown: 994 closed ports
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh
646/tcp   filtered ldp
711/tcp   filtered unknown
1755/tcp  filtered wms
5033/tcp  filtered unknown
50800/tcp filtered unknown</code></pre></div><p>If I run <strong>nmap &lt;host&gt;</strong> immediately again, then it gives a scary response:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Not shown: 506 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
1/tcp     open  tcpmux
3/tcp     open  compressnet
13/tcp    open  daytime
20/tcp    open  ftp-data
22/tcp    open  ssh
24/tcp    open  priv-mail
26/tcp    open  rsftp
30/tcp    open  unknown
37/tcp    open  time
43/tcp    open  whois
79/tcp    open  finger
83/tcp    open  mit-ml-dev
89/tcp    open  su-mit-tg
90/tcp    open  dnsix
99/tcp    open  metagram
... and other 495 open ports up to Port 65389 ...</code></pre></div><p>The iptables rules are what&#039;s shipped in default with 0.9 + the obvious 22 port opened.</p><p>If I try to telnet to these ports &quot;at least&quot; they aren&#039;t really open:<br />root@localhost:~# telnet hostname 389<br />Trying x.x.x.x...<br />telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused</p><p>So the question is something is wrong with the nmap query, or am I missing something with its usage. Or something is shaky with the firewall rules.</p><p>The other question is, the 646 and 711 ports are always displayed - how can I find out why these two ports below even appear? I&#039;m not aware about any application which would open them from the LAN, especially nothing on the router itself.<br />646/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered ldp<br />711/tcp&nbsp; &nbsp;filtered unknown</p><p>Ideally I&#039;d like to see something that only the 22 port is open.</p><p>thanks,<br />nm</p>									</div>
