					<p>I have the following situation:</p><p>My internet provider gave me a modem/wlan/router device which I placed in my living room. I connected that device via ethernet cable with my TP-Link router with openWrt on it which is located in another room. </p><p>The LAN-Zone of the provider router is 192.168.0.* and the LAN zone of the openwrt router is 192.168.1.*.</p><p>Everything is working fine, but my TV (192.168.0.10) which is in the living room connected via lan-cable with the provider-router&nbsp; can&#039;t speak with my PC in the other room (192.168.1.100). </p><p>How can I configure my openwrt router to get a working connection between my TV and my PC? But I want to use the openwrt router as a DHCP server and not only as access point. Any ideas`?</p>									</div>
