					<p>Hi all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am newbie to firmware customization. I just downloaded the open-wrt trunk by using svn. I run make menuconfig, selected the targeted architecture. Then i run make. Make is also finished. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know what to do next, how to configure &amp; build&nbsp; tools, toolchains etc for my architecture. If i want to add the packages, where to place it. How to cross-compile added package. What are the commands to cross compile. How to build a firmware image &amp; many more.</p><p>Can any one please tell me?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, you just built a firmware which should be in the &quot;bin&quot; directory. The cross compiling of all packages that you selected (Y or M) during config is already done. You can find a list of .ipk files in bin/packages/*</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks to all for the replies.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now i come to know if I do menuconfig &amp; make, the new firmware image which will be in bin directory. Just tell me what is the use of tools, toolchains &amp; target practically. Means these are used while make or we need to use it explicitly. If i add the package into my package list &amp; I want to compile &amp; install it into my firmware image, just I need to do make clean &amp;&amp; make world or I need to use these tools or toolchains explicitly. What is the use of target. How should i use it.</p><p>Plus how do i flash the generated image onto the router. So if i flash by using scp &amp; mdt, how do i access the router - means i don&#039;t have web interface to access the router. If ssh is not enabled or package not present, then how should i access the router.</p><p>Please help me.<br />Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ps_sach</strong> on 29 Apr 2009, 10:06)</p>

					<p>You can flash with tftp when you don&#039;t have ssh or web access.<br />Toolchain contains the cross-compiling suite to compile your firmware on your computer but for the platform of your router. Make does use it.</p><p>I suggest your read the documentation included with the source or <a href="http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html">http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply zorxd,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have access to the router before flashing, but after flashing if in the firmware image ssh package is not there &amp; i don&#039;t have web interface, then how do i access the router. May be I am asking this because I don&#039;t know too much about tftp. Not so important now.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I want to add package to the firmware image , i know the procedure &amp; what files I have to create. Create Package_name dir in package directory,create Makefile &amp; Config.in into it and some more control files in ipkg directory. If i want to add the package, can i download these files for some package like&nbsp; suppose vsftpd from source repository. I m using kamikaze 8.09 to build the firmware image. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After doing the required procedure to add the package, If I run command &quot;make&quot; again will it add&nbsp; package into the firmware image? </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Last one - Is there any tool that i can use to check the generated firmware image so that it wont brick the router?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Once you followed the instructions in the link I posted to make your own package, I guess your can run make menuconfig to select your package for inclusion in the firmware.

					<p>Hi all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I mentioned, I m going to create my own web interface for my firmware.&nbsp; But i don&#039;t know too much about the configurations. For example if i include chillispot package, which file I need to edit &amp; what entries I need to place into it. I know the basic configuration, but to make it as a firmware I need to do detailed configuration. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong> So in short I need a configuration guide that will tell me, if I include this package - I need&nbsp; to edit these files &amp; I need to do these configurations into it.</strong></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ps_sach</strong> on 7 May 2009, 13:04)</p>
