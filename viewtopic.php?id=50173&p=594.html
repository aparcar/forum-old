OpenWRT is a pece of softwair you install on your router to replace the softwair that comes on it from the factry. There is menny things you can do with OpenWRT and LEDE that you cant do with the stock fermwair. Fermwair like OpenWRT or LEDE witch is the same as OpenWRT just more up to date lets you get the latest fixs. All so you can install packages like addblockers and vpn clients and mutch more! Sorry about my crap spelling.</p>									</div>

					<p>Guys, i need some help. Today i bricked my router (wrt1900ac v1/mamba). Havent updated it for a while so i thought its time to try LEDE. As the previous image was openwrt cc i tried to upload the sysupgrade bin but maybe that was a mistake. Anyway about 2 yrs ago i ordered a usb-ttl cable just in case, trying to use it now for the first time without any success. Connected rx, tx and ground cables to the appropriate pins as mentioned in the manual (1-gnd,2-tx,4-rx) And plug it in a windows7 machine. I believe the appropriate drivers are installed. Im trying to connect via putty, but nothing happens. if i turn on the router, the power led keeps blinking, but nothing happens on the terminal. Do you have any idea what am i doing wrong?<br />Heres a pic about the connected cable: <a href="https://ibb.co/ivA9t6">https://ibb.co/ivA9t6</a><br />and another one with the putty settings and device manager: <a href="https://ibb.co/eMa9t6">https://ibb.co/eMa9t6</a><br />Thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>This isnt meant in a rude or mean way, but reading through this and the other post over 200 pages, every 2nd post is like &quot;my WRT1900AC/1200/3200 has a kernel panic every x hours&quot; or &quot;wifi is unstable&quot; and this for years back on these posts.

Are there good hopes or chances, the issues will be fixed in the near future? Or should I look for another router to buy (I dont know any other though with a good CPU) for this price. I also wanted to upgrade to have an even more stable 5GHz wifi, the Netgear isnt unstable but sometimes the bandwidth has some little &quot;hick ups&quot;.
