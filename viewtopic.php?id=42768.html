					<p>Hey all,</p><p>I more than likely did something to cause it given my lack of experience with CLI in recent times.</p><p>I flashed the latest factory OpenWRT for my model via the webGUI over LAN. All good, telnet then SSH&#039;d in. Configured PPPoE with a bridged modem and downloaded Luci using opkg in PuTTy.</p><p>Opened up the Luci webGUI and wifi was missing. Played around a bit, couldn&#039;t get it to work. Flashed back to factory using Luci webGUI (I used a .bin without &#039;boot&#039; in it).</p><p>PPPoE is working on stock firmware but wireless is cactus. WLAN light illuminates during the restart of the router but then stays off. WLAN settings can be configured fine but no SSID can be detected by any of my devices (Australia, channel 6).</p><p>Flashed back to OpenWRT but this time AA1209RC1. Tried to configure PPPoE, not working. Odd. Reconfigured the TP-Link to pull WAN and LAN from DHCP and changed modem (Billion 7300G) to do modem and routing duties. Downloaded Luci to TP-Link using opkg in PuTTy.</p><p>WLAN missing, WAN present. WAN won&#039;t work as PPPoE any more. Flash back to stock firmware. WLAN and WAN not working.</p><p>System LED on the unit keeps flashing all the time too. I figured I&#039;ve broken it. Still works fine as a LAN router but I was wondering if anyone has any idea to try to see if I can get WLAN and WAN back?</p>									</div>

					<p>This seems different to wagsoft&#039;s issue, in that flashing OEM does not fix the issue.<br />Do you still have an ART partition, adam?</p>									</div>

					<p>ART = Atheros Radio Test. It is a hidden partition that has tuning info for the atheros, without it, no WiFi.<br />To see if you have it, or accidentally overwrote it try:<br />cat /proc/mtd</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m assuming I would have to flash back to OpenWRT to do that? </p><p>To dump (view?) it, would the command be:</p><p>vi /proc/mtd </p><p>?</p><p>Sorry for the noob questions, I work in IT but we barely do any command line stuff except for ipconfig, ping and tracert haha.</p><p>EDIT: </p><p>The cat command shows u-boot, kernel etc etc and ART</p><p>The vi command shows a blank file.
