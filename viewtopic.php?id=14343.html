					<p>Hi guys!</p><p>First thanks to the crew and developers for this wonderful firmware!</p><p>I installed WhiteRussian 0.9 on my Linksys WRT54GL v1.1 and everything went well, then I installed a package for extended PPTP support (cant remember the package name) and the router started to behave strangley, to be exact I coulnt access the web interface so I decided to reflash the router.</p><p>Started the reflash the router but the install hung after 2 min but I let it to continue flash for an hour, but nothing happend, I tried to access the router from ssh without any luck, same with telnet. However when I rebooted the router (I know, stupid) I could access the router from both telnet and ssh but the web interface and more advanced functions are down. Also tried to flash the router with the command tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT imagefile.bin but it timed out all the times I tried to flash it that way.</p><p>So to my question, how can I reflash the router from either tftp, ssh or telnet? It&#039;s not completely dead since I can ping it and access it from SSH and telnet.</p>									</div>
