					<p>I&#039;ve just basic skill, i try to explain better: i can access to openwrt (that you find yet installed on box) via web. This is openwrt chaos calmer 15.05.1, the webui is LuCi 160627, on the web ui --&gt;user&amp;pswrd--&gt;nas service--&gt;samba--&gt; Here I can see two pages, the firsth:&quot;general option&quot; includes hostname,workgroup,Share home directories=1(that i&#039;m trying to understand for it), shared directories (with two usb attached to the box). What I don&#039;t understand is why /home directory of box there isn&#039;t shared? Anyway, the second page &quot;edit template&quot; is where i found that configuration i posted, it reportes &quot;Edit the template that is used for generating the samba configuration.&quot;...i&#039;m sorry but i tought that it was an easy problem-solve</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, as it is written in the manual, perform initial configuration via LuCI. After that add share sda. See config file, section &#039;sambashare&#039;, copy it, append and modify string like /dev/sda to your home directory (see output of mount command).</p>									</div>

					<p>oook, very thanks for your help because i thing that i said about something wrong/impossible in the box site: in order:<br /></p><ul><li><p>to estabilish the initial configuration: i think it&#039;s already OK, samba is in function like I said</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>you are wright:&quot;(see output of mount command) how can I? .&quot;the very great problem is that i don&#039;t know and i don&#039;t find what is the name of internal memory. If i go to openwrt on ssh i didn&#039;t find the classic directory that contains (Android,download,data,etc). I can see on /mnt an &quot;android&quot; directory (besides sda and sdb1 that there are usb) but if entry and get: ls or ls -al i can&#039;t see no one of directory of home...</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>if I can find out what the name of the internal memory is, I can&nbsp; modify config file on Luci or i have to connect with terminal and modify manually the samba file conf?</p></li></ul><p> i repeat sorry for my english: speaking in english about some technical affairs it&#039;s very difficult for me</p><p>EDIT sorry for my third question, i had the answer in the guide you are link me</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>compostodavide</strong> on 28 Sep 2017, 18:51)</p>

					<p>I was &quot;studying&quot; the exixtent template and I noted option &quot;Invalid users= root&quot; what does it mean? i login like root-user. In config samba that you have posted, there is an option :&quot;homes&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; boolean &nbsp; &nbsp; no &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0, 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Share the user directory . On Luci in general option (samba) page, i have: Share home-directories = 1 (Allow system users to reach their home directories via network shares). Maybe i just have to switch &quot;1&quot; to &quot;0&quot; or I have insert this option &quot;home&quot; in template</p>									</div>
