					<p>I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place to post this question but I&#039;m hoping someone can help out. </p><p>I am using Commotion which is OpenWRT based on a Ubiquiti Pico station. I&#039;m trying to configure a PPTP connection. I&#039;ve installed ppp-mod-pptp form:<br /><span style="color: blue">attitude_adjustment/12.09/ar71xx/generic/packages/</span> <br />and the installation completed successfully. </p><p>I have configured a pptp connection (I&#039;ve tried creating a new interface for it and simply changing the WAN interface to pptp). The problem is that when I try and connect it doesn&#039;t connect (RX and TX show no activity). The only potential clue that I have to go on is that I get this:</p><p><span style="color: red">daemon.warn avahi-daemon[1737]: Received packet from invalid interface.</span></p><p>error in logread. But on researching this, it doesn&#039;t seem to have anything to do with pptp, although it does pop up every time I try and connect the interface. </p><p>Additionally I don&#039;t see any pptp or similar processes in ps or in init.d.</p><p>Is there a solution to this? Is there a way in which I can determine if ppp-mod-pptp is correctly installed and running?</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I know, all logs related to this go to logread; however, you can configure the interface to be more verbose on the logs when trying to connect.</p>									</div>
