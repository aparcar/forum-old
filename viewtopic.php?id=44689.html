					<p>Hi all,</p><p>is it somehow possible to connect a box running OpenWRT with two wifi networks on different channels? I have to investigate if such a thing is possible. The idea is to establish a connection to the backbone network via one wifi network/channel and provide a wireless access point via the other.</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ptw</strong> on 13 Jun 2013, 14:03)</p>

					<p>It is. You&#039;d need two wifi devices (i.e. an OpenWrt device with two physical network cards) to do so though. To the best of my knowledge, virtual interfaces running on the very same wifi device can&#039;t operate on distinct channels.</p><p>EDIT: Certainly operating one station interface and one, or even multiple, ap interfaces on the very same channel is possible with just one wifi device (assumed the chipset/driver supports it, which is the case for e.g. Atheros cards).</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orange</strong> on 13 Jun 2013, 13:35)</p>

					<p>Given that a WNIC consist of two physical components: a layer2 chip and up to three layer1 chips. Why cant I operate the three PHY-Chips on different channels when I do not use MIMO?</p>									</div>

					<p>Certainly. It&#039;s not that difficult actually. Assuming a default OpenWrt /e/c/network and /e/c/wireless, you start in defining a new interface wan section in /e/c/network like<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;
   option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;dhcp&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Now, in /e/c/wireless you define your sta interface (ap should be there already)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;
   option &#039;device&#039; &#039;radio0&#039;
   option &#039;network&#039; &#039;wan&#039;
   option &#039;mode&#039; &#039;sta&#039;
   option &#039;ssid&#039; &#039;your-ssid-to-connect-to&#039;
   option &#039;encryption&#039; &#039;psk2&#039;
   option &#039;key&#039; &#039;your-secret-key&#039;</code></pre></div><p>&quot;option &#039;device&#039;&quot; certainly depends on your router model, just look at the ap section and copy its &quot;option &#039;device&#039;&quot;. Could be &#039;wifi0&#039;, &#039;wl0&#039;, most likely &#039;radio0&#039;. Then reboot (see EDIT) and it should work.</p><p>Also, read <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</a> for additional information.</p><p>EDIT: What I just explained is called &quot;routed client&quot;, i.e. you need to take care that the host router and the repeater have distinct subnets, e.g. host 192.168.0.1/24, repeater 192.168.1.1/24. This is to be defined in /e/c/network lan section, &quot;option &#039;ipaddr&#039;&quot;. Do this before rebooting.</p><p>There are other opportunities/configurations, e.g. relayd if you want everything on the very same subnet. I recommend you the config I just posted.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>orange</strong> on 27 Jun 2013, 01:33)</p>

It was very helpful and I&#039;ve managed to set up three networks now:</p><p>Network 1 (wlan0-1): 172.16.10.92, wireless, DHCP<br />Network 2 (eth0): 192.168.0.1, wired, static IP<br />Network 2 (wlan0): 192.168.1.1, wireless, static IP</p><p>Network 1 and 3 both use the same radio device, quite as you suggested.
