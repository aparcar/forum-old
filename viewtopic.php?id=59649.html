					<p>With the help of people of this forum <a href="http://foro.seguridadwireless.net/openwrt/flashear-xte-mf10/,">http://foro.seguridadwireless.net/openw … xte-mf10/,</a> i installed OpenWrt 12.09 on my ZTE MF10 router.<br />The router is based on ramips RT3050F, has 8 MB of flash memory and only 16 MB or RAM (this limited amount of memory explains the choice of OpenWrt 12.09).<br />The forum mentionned above explains how to install the OpenWrt firmware.<br />I made a patch to add support to specific GPIO of the router.

					<p>I don&#039;t understand what you want to do.<br />You made a backup of the mtd3 and mtd4 partitions of a first router, and you want to flash the backup files in the mtd3 and mtd4 partitions of another router ?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know if the instructions can be adapted to Windows.<br />I have to made some tests and when they&#039;re done i will try to help you.<br />The idea is still the same : transfer busybox with expect program, then use busybox to transfer backup files on the router and then use the command mtd_write to flash mtd3 and mtd4.<br />Of course you have to be sure that mtd3 and mtd4 partitions are the same size on both router, else you have to concat mtd3 and mtd4 backup files in a single file and split it in two files whose size correspond to mtd3 and mtd4 size of the destination router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi</p><p>On windows you must install cygwin with optional packages inetutils and expect.<br />That way you will have utilities dd, expect and telnet used in the tutorial.<br />If you want i can send you the &#039;expect&#039; script (used at step 4 of the tutorial) i generate to send busybox on the router.<br />And when busybox is on the router you will be able to transfer your files on the router and flash them on the mtd3 and mtd4 partitions.<br />Once again i warn you about the size of the files, that must match the size of the partitions you intend to write</p>									</div>

					<p>I prefer that you try by yourself : it will allow you to acquire a bit of practice.<br />I think that if you follow the tutorial you should succeed.<br />cygwin is very simple to install : you must install the optional packages inetutils, expect and tftp-server (you can also install another tftp-server than the one provided by cygwin)<br />The expect script i previously talked about is available here : <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9HzbfHuBjZ0bm0xeVNscUl0ZG8">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9Hzb … VNscUl0ZG8</a><br />- Launch the cygwin terminal and decompress the script. I suppose that you put it in &quot;c:\tmp&quot;<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>gunzip /cygdrive/c/tmp/shell_trx.gz</code></pre></div><p>The script consider the router address is 192.168.0.1. You can change it in the script at line 9, with a simple text editor (i recommend Notepad++ because it does not convert end of line)<br />- Transfer the file on the router with the following command<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>expect -b /cygdrive/c/tmp/shell_trx</code></pre></div><p>At the beginning of the script, expect switch to interactive mode to allow you to login. One you are logged in, type the commands<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cp /bin/mii_mgr /var/busybox
PS1=&#039;zte-mf10 &#039;</code></pre></div><p> (beware of the case and the space character between zte-mf10 and the quote) and type CTRL-C to exit interactive mode.<br />Wait a few minutes for the transfer to complete.<br />- Finally verifiy the md5sum : on the router type<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cd /var
./busybox md5sum busybox</code></pre></div><p>The result must be </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>fdb55b8cc45c87c84b5ee5b503866e6b</code></pre></div><p>- Then follow the rest of the tutorial to transfer the files you want to flash on the router with mtd_write.</p><p>Note that the previous commands can&#039;t harm your router. busybox is written in tmpfs (which is a filesystem in memory) and will be erased as soon as you reboot the router.<br />The only dangerous commands are the two final mtd_write of the tutorial.<br />That why i insist that you must check after each file transfer the md5sum and that the flash partitions and the backup files are the same size.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe the two routers don&#039;t run the same version of firmware.<br />Are you sure the backup files are ok ?<br />If they are, so you should adapt to the size of the partitions.<br />First check that mtd3 and mtd4 are contiguous and does not overlap<br />Then you must concat the backup files of mtd3 and mtd4 with command <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat backup_mtd3 backup_mtd4 &gt; backup_mtd3_mtd4</code></pre></div><p>Compute md5sum of the resulting file<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>md5sum backup_mtd3_mtd4</code></pre></div><p>Then you must split the file to match the mtd3 and mtd4 size of the router you want to flash with command dd<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=backup_mtd3_mtd4 of=mtd3 bs=65536 count=20</code></pre></div><p> (20 * 65536 = 1280 Ko)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>dd if=backup_mtd3_mtd4 of=mtd4 bs=65536 skip=20</code></pre></div><p>You can check that everything is ok by concatening the two new files and computing once again the md5sum<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat mtd3 mtd4 &gt;mtd3_mtd4
