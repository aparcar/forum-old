					<p>I think what RangerZ is trying to say is this:</p><p>It woulld be good to see where and how many radio&#039;s are on a channel.&nbsp; No need to see the SSID so that stay&#039;s hidden as it should.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is no secret that a radio is transmitting on channel xNo need to hide that info, and no need to create a illusion that it is hidden either.&nbsp; </p><p>If everyone just used channel 1, 6 ,11 that would probably be better then clogging up the bandwidth by using the channels inbetween.&nbsp; &nbsp;When someone uses channel 3 then Channel 1 and 6 have to deal with interferance.</p><p>when you know where the hidden SSID&#039;s are transmitting then at least you can choose a channel with the least interferance. </p><p>So the hidden SSID&#039;s stay hidden but are unknown SSID&#039;s on a known channel.&nbsp; </p><p>@makarel: the option hide SSID only is there to hide the SSID Not to hide any other info. A transmitter that broadcasts radiowaves is not hidden in any way. I simply does not broadcast the name of the station, but &#039;the music&#039; is there for all to hear.&nbsp; <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Using 1 6 11 makes the best use of the Wifi spectrum since 12 and 13 are forbidden in some countries&nbsp; that makes 1 and 11 sitting on the outer edges and 6 in the middle. That&#039;s why that would be ideal.&nbsp; There are some very good studies done on that.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take my word on it, Any searchengine should be able to find good articles about this</p><p>And depenting on the exact lenght of your antenna you may have a channel that might just have more gain then the others.</p><p>Anyhow, Hidden SSID says enough (the SSID is hidden) It does not say hidden channel, since there is no way to hide a radio wave. So I like RangerZ&#039;s suggestion that it would be nice if OpenWRT could show this (just like some other software does)&nbsp; I&#039;m sure this will happen since it makes most sense. So I fully support this as a reminder.</p><p> <span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1000px-2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_802.11bg_WLAN.svg_-640x149.png" alt="1 6 11" /></span><br />why channel 1 6 11</p><p><a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/179344-how-to-boost-your-wifi-speed-by-choosing-the-right-channel">http://www.extremetech.com/computing/17 … ht-channel</a><br /><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/382042/why-use-wifi-channels-other-than-1-6-or-11">http://superuser.com/questions/382042/w … -1-6-or-11</a><br /><a href="http://www.metageek.com/training/resources/why-channels-1-6-11.html">http://www.metageek.com/training/resour … -6-11.html</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11</a><br />At the bottom of this wiki is a list of references. at least one of them will have a academic study that explains this in more detail.</p><p>Might it be an idea to make a OpenWRT wiki page as well?

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>This either differs between chipsets or versions. But at least on all of my devices, hidden wifi nodes are available as well.</p><p>I just tried that on a couple of devices:</p><p>TP-Link 1043 v1, OpenWrt BB:<br />* Has only 2.4GHz and worked.</p><p>TP-Link 1043 v1, OpenWrt CC:<br />* Has only 2.4GHz and worked.</p><p>TP-Link 4300 v1, OpenWrt BB:<br />* worked on 2.4GHz<br />* did not work on 5GHz</p><p>TP-Link 4900 v1.7, OpenWrt BB r40004<br />* worked on 2.4GHz<br />* did not work on 5GHz</p><p>But the 5GHz channels might just not be powerfull enough.</p><p>By calling it &quot;working&quot; I mean: The scan results page shows the word &quot;hidden&quot; in italics, tells me the channel and names the BSSID.</p><p>So at least on my personal setup, hidden channels are very present.<br />I even can select them and join via LuCI. Just did that yesterday on the CC 1043 device.<br />Initially those links target the BSSID. I removed the BSSID value and added the actual ESSID. Works great, all done by LuCI.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>i forbid?? I said: in some countries it is forbidden to use the high channels...&nbsp; By law... not where I live but some countries have laws that forbid this.&nbsp; Please read the links I posted, I explained all I could. Now it&#039;s up to you to do what you like.&nbsp; If you want to break laws thats fine with me but within the laws 1 6 11 is the best option for everyone who wants to simply get the best out of it. </p><p>Please read the links I posted they say it all. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>From your reply it certainly does not sound like you understood the info on those pages. And that not a problem, but those are the facts. If you want to explain those facts away and confuse others that&#039;s not the best way to go, but i&#039;m not going to stop you... If you want to use channels wit most interference thats also up to you.<br />And, it is also up you you if you want to cause interference for your neighbours.&nbsp; </p><p>When you have the facts that show a better solution, you are free to ignore them, but please don&#039;t confuse other people.</p><p>Again this 1 6 11 option is very well documented, please read it, even better TEST IT and show us your test measurements and data troughput results. If you find a better solution then everyone will love you for that. (Me included)&nbsp; </p><p>If you prefer to stick your head in the ground and ignore the interference that does not give you a better data troughput.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>And ok, if all your neighbours are interfering on channel 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 and 10 then you will have a big task ahead of you to actually test it or to get rid of interference...</p><p>I&#039;m often wrong and then someone can teach me to get things right, but in this case I have all the facts, and I showed them and I try my best to teach others about those facts. And if I&#039;m wrong then I will change my view, no problem. But these facts are very clear to me.&nbsp; I just try to help and pass the little knowledge I have</p>									</div>
