					<p>Hello! I am new to the OpenWRT world and just got a wr703n router to play with. I loaded OpenWRT onto it using the instructions found here: <a href="http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Install_OpenWRT_on_TPlink_WR703N">http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Install â€¦ ink_WR703N</a></p><p>I made the mistake of setting the wifi info referenced under &quot;Configure Wifi&quot; under the impression that would be my new network (not connecting the WR703n to an existing network), so left it open with the name &quot;OpenWRT.&quot;</p><p>I rebooted and now, unfortuently, I appear to be unable to connect via Ethernet or wireless. Realizing that I screwed up, I created a network called &quot;OpenWRT&quot; and it does appear the device connects (I tried it with the mobile hotspot on my phone and the WR703n connects per the android hotspot info screen) but was unable to figure out the IP to try an SSH connection. So, I tried it with my main wifi, but did not see the WR703n in my DHCP list. </p><p>Does anyone have any ideas? Any help is appreciated!</p><p>EDIT: When connected via ethernet, it says &quot;Unidentifed Network&quot; and &quot;No Network Access&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>antimattercrusader</strong> on 2 May 2013, 01:51)</p>

					<p>Ok, so found the failsafe page for this router specifically, as well as the generic one. I followed these instructions: </p><p>----------------------------------<br />Failsafe mode<br />When the configuration no longer allows you to log in via any network connection (e.g. lost password), the OpenWrt failsafe mode can be entered via the single &quot;Reset&quot; button on the device. However, in contrast to the generic failsafe instructions, for the TL-WR703N you have to wait for ca. 10 (10-12) seconds before pushing the &quot;Reset&quot; button after powering on the device. If the button is pushed immediately after powering on, the single blue LED will start blinking, supposedly indicating some failsafe firmware recovery mody of the embedded bootloader (not yet discovered how to use it). In this mode, the OpenWrt failsafe is not being started. Instead, wait for slightly longer than 10 seconds and - as soon as the LED starts blinking for the first time after powering on the device, push the &quot;Reset&quot; button for ca. 1-2 seconds. Immediately afterwards, the LED will blink rapidly (multiple Hz) and OpenWrt will be in failsafe mode.</p><p>- The above didn&#039;t work on a Ver 1.6 box running OpenWRT r33312. To get into failsafe mode, power up the device and wait until the LED starts flashing (about 2Hz). Once it starts flashing (within about 4 seconds) then quickly press the button. The LED will then flash much faster and the device will be in failsafe mode.<br />----------------------------</p><p>Since I have the rapidly blinking light, I should have triggered failsafe mode, meaning the next step is to telnet in. However, it still says &quot;No Network Access&quot; &quot;Unidentified Network&quot; and it seems I am unable to telnet to: 192.168.1.1 (including port 24). </p><p>Did I miss anything? Any thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sweet! Nevermind, I had not set a static IP on my system. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Seems to be working now.</p>									</div>
