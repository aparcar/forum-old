					<p>@Lubomir, thanks, but I&#039;m more interested in what&#039;s in common use... any ideas on how to get e.g. download stats?</p><p>@zorxd, the WNDR3700 seems wildly popular. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I wanted to buy TP-Link TL-WR1043ND because of the price but I needed a vertical positioning. So I bought WNDR3700 but it was too tall and it wouldn&#039;t fit into my self made shelf. Finally I bought a used and cheap buffalo WZR-HP-AG300H that fits perfectly and it has external antennas : ) </p><p>ps you shouldn&#039;t expect much from buffalo and wndr3700 models as they are mips 24kc soc routers and they don&#039;t even have a floating point unit. They are just fine for routing purposes.</p>									</div>
