					<p>Hi everyone. I managed to set up OpenVPN successfully on my router, but dnsleaktest.com says I have a DNS leak when I&#039;m connected through the router. The exact same VPN is fine when I connect using client software instead. This leads me to believe the problem is not with my VPN provider, but with my OpenWrt configuration. Here are the steps I followed:</p><p>1. Install the package openvpn-openssl in OpenWrt 15.05<br />2. Add a new interface for the VPN<br />3. All zones that forward to WAN are now forwarded to the VPN zone instead (I believe this prevents me from accidentally browsing without the VPN)<br />4. Transfer .ovpn file and all associated files like ca.crt into /etc/openvpn<br />5. Check IP address to make sure it is assigned by the VPN provider. It is.<br />6. Check for DNS leaks. I am indeed leaking. I have one router directly connected to the modem and using OpenDNS servers. My second router is the VPN router. dnsleaktest.com shows that my DNS server is an OpenDNS server instead of the VPN provider&#039;s own DNS servers</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you want use OpenDNS servers you are fine, if you want use DNS servers of your VPN provider, continue reading.</p><p>You need VPN nameservers in /tmp/resolv.conf.auto.<br />Check your&nbsp; /tmp/resolv.conf.auto if it contains DNS servers of your VPN provider.<br />If not and if I know, OpenVPN scripts in OpenWRT doesnt handle DNS servers, you must play with up/down hooks in OpenVPN.<br />If you use static DNS server while on VPN, it is easy as in up script you need only backup old resolv.conf.auto and make custom file with static nameserver and in down script restore old resolv.conf.<br />If your VPN provider often change DNS servers, you need some script to parse dns options.<br />Take inspiration from:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26746">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=26746</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/masterkorp/openvpn-update-resolv-conf/blob/master/update-resolv-conf.sh">https://github.com/masterkorp/openvpn-u … lv-conf.sh</a><br />Or another update-resolv-conf scripts from various openvpn packages in linux distributions which handle it(e.g. Debian)</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been trying to get this working, but I have a few questions/problems:</p><p>1. If I set the DNS servers using either of the options you suggested (static or changing), would I be vulnerable to this type of DNS hijacking?:</p><p><a href="http://www.bgpmon.net/turkey-hijacking-ip-addresses-for-popular-global-dns-providers/">http://www.bgpmon.net/turkey-hijacking- … providers/</a></p><p>I am not concerned about my VPN provider hijacking my requests. I trust my VPN provider. I am more concerned about the ISP that I&#039;m tunneling through. To be sure I understand the situation correctly, my VPN provider is the only one who can hijack my DNS requests; not my ISP, right?</p><p>2. I just checked the /tmp/resolv.conf.auto file in my router and it&#039;s completely blank. The command <br />cat /tmp/resolv.conf.auto returns a local IP address; the address of the router that my VPN router is behind.</p><p>This article here <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dhcp.dnsmasq">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dhcp.dnsmasq</a> suggests:<br />server=(DNS IP #1)<br />server=(DNS IP #2)</p><p>But it&#039;s suggesting adding those 2 lines to /etc/dnsmasq.conf, not /tmp/resolv.conf.auto. What are the exact lines I need to put in /tmp/resolv.conf.auto to have the router using those DNS addresses instead?</p><p>3. If I go with the script to parse dns options, your second link suggests that I use the following up/down scripts:</p><p>/etc/tunup<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#ACTION=ifup DEVICE=tun0 INTERFACE=vpn /sbin/hotplug-call iface
mv /tmp/resolv.conf.auto /tmp/resolv.conf.auto.hold
echo $foreign_option_1 | sed -e &#039;s/dhcp-option DOMAIN/domain/g&#039; -e &#039;s/dhcp-option DNS/nameserver/g&#039; &gt; /tmp/resolv.conf.auto
echo $foreign_option_2 | sed -e &#039;s/dhcp-option DOMAIN/domain/g&#039; -e &#039;s/dhcp-option DNS/nameserver/g&#039; &gt;&gt; /tmp/resolv.conf.auto
echo $foreign_option_3 | sed -e &#039;s/dhcp-option DOMAIN/domain/g&#039; -e &#039;s/dhcp-option DNS/nameserver/g&#039; &gt;&gt; /tmp/resolv.conf.auto</code></pre></div><p>/etc/tundown<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
mv /tmp/resolv.conf.auto.hold /tmp/resolv.conf.auto</code></pre></div><p>But before implementing these scripts, I ran the command &quot;cat /tmp/resolv.conf.auto&quot; and it returned the local IP address of the router in front of my VPN router. How could the scripts above get the IP address of the DNS server pushed by my VPN provider if /tmp/resov.conf/auto doesn&#039;t even have that IP address?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pokingaround</strong> on 11 Jan 2016, 00:21)</p>

					<p>Anyone? I still can&#039;t quite get this to work properly. I tried putting the specific DNS server IPs into various parts of the Luci configuration, but I&#039;m still leaking.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you cant see DNS in enviroment variables, and you know IP of openvpn DNS, you can reconfigure DNS settings with uci.</p><p>Add this to show all enviroment variables to UP script:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>echo &quot;$(env)&quot; &gt; /tmp/openvpnenv</code></pre></div><p>Remember to remove it from script.</p><p>If you use always&nbsp; VPN, you can use persistent DNS settings:<br />you need to have direct way to resolve ntp server and vpn server if they dont have static IP.</p><p>To /etc/config/dhcp add/change section config dnsmasq:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#   option resolvfile           &#039;/tmp/resolv.conf.auto&#039;

					<p>Would you mind pointing me to some documentation on the up script? I&#039;ve heard more than one person mention up and down scripts but I don&#039;t know anything about them.</p><p>Is it a flaw in OpenWrt that the VPN&#039;s own DNS servers aren&#039;t used? When connecting with any software client, I don&#039;t have this problem, so it doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s anything that can be fixed on the VPN provider&#039;s end.</p>									</div>
