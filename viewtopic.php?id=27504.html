					<p>Why not go for a Netgear WNDR3700? I sold my E3000 and switched, never looked back. Faster CPU (680MHz vs 480MHz), cooler chassis (both temperature and looks wise) and cheaper.Dual band N and works very welll with trunk.</p>									</div>

					<p>thanks!<br />i`m aware of that model, but it`s larger, it`s more expensive and apparently, it consumes more energy. <br />nice howto, though - thanks for the pointer!</p><p>so the above reasons are why i`m interested in mr3220/40. i don`t only want it for myself but for a project - so it`s better to have a more recent hardware for that.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rolandk</strong> on 12 Dec 2010, 17:25)</p>
