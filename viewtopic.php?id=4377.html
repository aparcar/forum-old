					<p>Ok I&#039;ve followed the buildroot through twice first with the stable and it sucesfully did a make but I couldn&#039;t get GPSD 2.30 to make. So, I&#039;m assuming that I have all the needed programs installed so my buildroot environment is valid. So I changed to the devel trunk since GPSD is in there already and it should be a simple mattter to just do a make. I was wrong.</p><p>I ran a make and here&#039;s what happened:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/home/user/trunk/openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/bin/mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG -I. -I. -I. 
-I/home/user/trunk/openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/usr/include -I/home/user/trunk/openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/include -I/usr/include -Os -pipe

make[6]: *** leaving [netlib.lo] Error 1
make[6]: Leaving directory &#039;/home/usr/trunk/openwrt/build_mipsel/gpsd-2.30&#039;</code></pre></div><p>So, this leads me to believe there is an error in the netlib.lo file. However I&#039;m not sure how to go about tracking it down and fixing or what the error really is. I <em>assumed</em> that gpsd was stable since Nico has successfully built a gpsd 2.30.ipk. I <em>assumed</em> that the source would build if it&#039;s in the buildroot.</p><p>If you ask why the heck are you trying to build it if it&#039;s already done? Well, this a learning excercise that I can learn how to build other packages later.</p>									</div>
