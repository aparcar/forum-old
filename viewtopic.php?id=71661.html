					<p>hi,<br />I have openwrt 15.05.1 installed on Tp-link WR841ND.&nbsp; I have created small website on my android phone&nbsp; which runs on port 7575 as port 80 is not available in android. </p><p>I can access my website on phone with url, 192.168.2.103:7575 but I want it to access it 192.168.2.103. I have setup following firewall rules under &quot;Custom Rules&quot; as below</p><p>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 192.168.2.103 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.103:7575<br />iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE</p><p>But these rules are not working. Any help or pointers?&nbsp; thanks in advance</p>									</div>

					<p>Any reason for not using OpenWRT firewall abstraction?<br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#port_forwarding_for_ipv4_destination_natdnat">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewa â€¦ on_natdnat</a></p><p>Just in case you want to &quot;get rid of the port while inside of your network&quot;: Your other computers won&#039;t call your phone &quot;through the router&quot;, so that&#039;s not possible by adding config to your router. You need to adjust that on your phone.</p><p>You could add a rule that redirects 192.168.3.1:80 to 192.168.2.103:7575 with NAT and use 192.168.3.1 in your browser. But for sure you need to use an IP address that will get routed instead if just being handled by the router switch component.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 29 Jul 2017, 16:21)</p>
