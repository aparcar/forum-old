					<p>Floor to floor reception in my house is not very good (lots of metal mesh used in installing tile flooring).</p><p>In order to compensate for this I am think of putting a router per floor. I have a couple of spare DIR-825s.</p><p>I am trying to work out how to configure them such that all attached systems on the LAN can see each other.<br />I am assuming that I would hook each of the 825s to the main router and configure their LANs without DHCP, relying on the main router to provide DHCP/DHCP6 service.</p><p>I tried this but it did not seem to work. As I did this a couple of months ago I don;t have my original configs. <br />Is this possible or am I dreaming in technicolor.</p><p>A second question is can I use the same SSIDs for all WiFi connections, or will this cause me problems?</p>									</div>

					<p>Depending on the protocol that your PCs are using, you&#039;ll definitely need to bridge the networks on both devices, to get the functionality you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; To do this, you&#039;ll still need a L2VPN.&nbsp; </p><p>DHCP isn&#039;t needed for a router to route.&nbsp; Devices that seem to have both L2 and L3 functionality are typically called L3 switches... or routers depending on how you see them.&nbsp; </p><p>If you want to have your PCs be able to find each other using broadcasts, broadcasts don&#039;t traverse layer 3 boundaries.&nbsp; Therefore, you want be able to have the same broadcast domain exist on 2 devices.&nbsp; Which would either require you to have a trunk between the two devices, if they operate on layer 2, OR a layer 2 VPN if they operate on layer 3.</p><p>If you can get a signal from a device on one floor from another, then you could just get a repeater, which is basically a wireless bridge from the point of view of your PCs relative to your (router/switch/AP/whatever).</p><p>L2VPNs are cool, unless you&#039;re in a hurry.&nbsp; Otherwise, just get a repeater, and be done.&nbsp; (Remember, having one wireless router act as a client to another still creates a layer 3 boundary between the PCs connected to them.)</p>									</div>
