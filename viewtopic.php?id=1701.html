					<p>What did you change that you now need to jtag? Im assuming its a bad clkfrew setting.. If it is, then you have a very VERY small window to get the jtag to work.. Your best bet is to unplug the router, then get the command to erase what you want ready (ie: already typed in) and then plug in the router, wait a split second, and hit enter. If it spitsout an error, quickly hit the up arrow and then enter. You basically need to get the jtag to start working before the bad settings get loaded, and you have a tiny window to do this in. If it still hangs after the router being on for 3 seconds, unplug and do it again. Ive sat there for hours trying to hit the window, other times i can hit it on the second try. It&#039;s all timing.</p><p>Check out this: <a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing#head-455444d2428716c9043194cd220ed88e53b1b0cb">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customiz … 8e53b1b0cb</a><br />for&nbsp; overclocking info, and then go to <a href="http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customizing#head-50e9ee3f70e5d5229aeade4c624b965b24de5967">http://openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Customiz … 5b24de5967</a> to learn how to keep this from happening again. By setting the reset_gpio nvram value in the cfe, when you reboot holding the reset button, it loads the nvram values int he cfe. For whatever reason linksys didnt do this by default. I use gpio 6, yours is probably the same.</p><p>if the links dont work, first one is to the overclocking seciton on the customization wiki page, second link is to the changing default&nbsp; cfe values on the same page</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok, well, if you can backup your cfe and email it to inh@burnmail.com. I&#039;ll make some changes (enable reset trick and boot_wait), and upload it to <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/inh/cfe/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/inh/cfe/</a></p>									</div>
