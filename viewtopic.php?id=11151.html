					<p>This is the situation: a local network connected to the internet via a DSL router/switch. This switch is connected to a router with OpenWRT (call it OpenRouter). OpenRouter is then connected to a network device. <br />OpenRouter should give this network device an IP (internal, via DHCP of OpenRouter). But OpenRouter should act as an OpenVPN client in such a way that the network device sends all traffic through OpenRouter and the DSL router/switch over the internet to a remotely located OpenVPN server. Is this possible with OpenWRT? How? OpenWRT should NOT be the OpenVPN server, just the client. OpenRouter should thus get two IPs (one from the DHCP server in the local network or a static one and one from the OpenVPN server (eg 10.8.0.7))... Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I have a location where I have a WRT unit running OpenVPN client.&nbsp; It has a certificate and connects to an OpenVPN server running on Linux box at another location.&nbsp; Key of 2048 bits recommended for medium security without slowing down initial connection setup TOO much.&nbsp; The server configuration hands it a static IP and routing information.&nbsp; Punch a few holes in the firewall software and I have full routing between locations so hosts in each location can access the other.&nbsp; I have to keep a hosts table updated on each side but since the number of hosts is fairly small this is not a problem.&nbsp; I much prefer a routed OpenVPN instead of bridged so there is not chatty sharing of silly broadcast packets only what is needed goes across the VPN.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 12 Jun 2007, 19:29)</p>

					<p>Interesting! Would you care posting configuration for this? Iptables or anything else useful? Do you also use an external router (ie not the OpenWrt device as router)? thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Don&#039;t have the time to post a tutorial on OpenVPN, sorry.&nbsp; There are plenty of those on the internet.&nbsp; Just letting you know it is indeed possible on these routers.&nbsp; The hardware is sufficient to the task assuming you aren&#039;t trying to shove a lot of data through there and bog down the CPU.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see why another layer of NAT would matter as long as the 2 devices can reach each other.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks. A silly question maybe, but is there a way to get the OpenWRT router to redirect all trafic through a proxy on the internet instead of an OpenVPN Server on the internet?</p>									</div>

					<p>I succesfully installed an OpenVPN client on my router (WRTSL54GS). From within SSH on the OpenWRT router, I can perfectly use it (the OpenVPN server is on the internet). However, when I connect&nbsp; a pc to the router, it does not seem to use the OpenVPN client connection, but just uses the standard connection (provided by a different router which is located &quot;behind&quot; the OpenWRT router). The router gets an IP, such as 10.8.0.5 from the OpenVPN server. The router then gives a different IP to a client, such as 10.10.10.234. I think I need to add some routing, but how? Thanks</p>									</div>
