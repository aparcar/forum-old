					<p>I was able to get the iwlmvm module working, so the card works now. I can see AP scan results to verify that it&#039;s working. The problem is, OpenWRT doesn&#039;t seem to actually want to do anything with the card. If I manually run hostapd with the following config, the card will work in AP mode:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211

hw_mode=g
channel=1
ssid=mac80211 test
ieee80211n=1
ht_capab=[HT40+][SHORT-GI-40][DSSS_CCK-40]</code></pre></div><p>The problem is, if I try to create the same config with /etc/config/wireless as follows, it doesn&#039;t work. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-device &#039;radio0&#039;
    option type &#039;mac80211&#039;
    option path &#039;pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0&#039;
    option hwmode &#039;11g&#039;
    option country &#039;US&#039;
    option channel &#039;1&#039;
    option htmode &#039;HT20&#039;

config wifi-iface
    option device &#039;radio0&#039;
    option mode &#039;ap&#039;
    option ssid &#039;mac80211 test&#039;
    option encryption &#039;none&#039;</code></pre></div><p>When I scan from another machine, no AP shows up. Also, on the wifi page in LuCI, it says &quot;Wireless is disabled or not associated&quot; (clicking the Enable button doesn&#039;t change this) and says that it&#039;s in client mode, despite it clearly being set to AP mode.</p><p>Also it works perfectly fine in client mode, I can scan, connect, and do DHCP successfully.</p><p>Edit: Upon further investigation, OpenWRT isn&#039;t even running hostapd, nor creating a config file for it in /var/run like it does on a working both with an ath9k card.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mattventura</strong> on 30 Nov 2014, 01:48)</p>
