					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve tried both trunk from around July and more recently, the rc5 of Backfire and I seem to get getting occasional wifi problems with my Buffalo WZR-G300NH.</p><p>Sometimes i&#039;m unable to connect to the wifi.</p><p>Restarting the wifi in OpenWRT fixes it straight away, or sometimes just trying again a bit later seems to work ok.</p><p>Anyone else having similar problems?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>

					<p>i tried backfire rc5 but it would not work for me in client bridge mode. gargoyle and dd-wrt have client bridge modes but dd-wrt is most ustable and gargoyle also locks up the router from time to time.<br />is there a way to get client bridge mode to work on openwrt or is it just that this mode is not supported on openwrt?</p>									</div>
