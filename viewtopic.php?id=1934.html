Even if it&#039;s not the one I was hoping for. That would have been something like have a look at /proc/foo/bar. But I guess I can live with the try and error method. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>you can try to use a chrooted mips debian distro. (maybe through nfs?)<br />I personally have an usb hard drive, and made a debian rootfs inside a file.<br />I just tried to launch a shell, it works, but did no more testing yet. there you have all &#039;real&#039; linux commands.<br />there is a howto on chupa forums.</p>									</div>
