					<p>Hello everyone and thank you all for openwrt. I installed the last version on a My Net N600 router and I have a wonderful router now (the original firmware was HORRIBLE!)</p><p>I live in australia and I struggle to configure the router to use our DSL. After some research I set up the connection using pppoe and vlan100 and everything works but I must use the LAN port 1 to connect the modem and I would like to use the WAN port and I don&#039;t know how to do that.</p><p>Here my interfaces.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1379454/tmp_pics/1_interfaces.png" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1379454/tmp_pics/1_interfaces.png" /></span></p><p>The Wan use the vlan set as id 100:</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1379454/tmp_pics/2_switch.png" alt="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1379454/tmp_pics/2_switch.png" /></span></p><p>To connect to internet I plug the DSL modem to the LAN port 1, but I would like to use the WAN port and left the LAN ports for the lan. Is that possible?</p><p>Note: I&#039;m a developer and my knowledge about routing/lan/vlan/ is minimal. Don&#039;t assume too much and if you can link me to article where I can learn something more. Thank you.</p>									</div>
