					<p>The v2.2 unit doesn&#039;t seem to use the ADMTek switch controller. It has a chip labeled BCM5325EKQM, manufactured by Broadcom instead of the ADMtek controller.<br />I wonder if it is possible to separate the 5 ports into differents vlans in the new WRT54G v2.2.<br />With the ADMTek switch it was possible with the admcfg tool and the adm.o module, or I also configured many vlans separating the ports with the adm6996.o module.<br />I haven&#039;t bought a new v2.2 yet so I didn&#039;t try this task.<br />Has anybody tried to use the adm.o module or the adm6996.o module to configure the BCM5325 switch?<br />Or has anybody solve this problem with a different tool?<br />Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
