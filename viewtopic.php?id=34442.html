					<p>I have two openwrt clients currently running the horrible Juniper Network Connect application for OS X and Windows. I&#039;d like to replace Network Connect on the clients by having openwrt manage the vpn connections. How can I do this?</p>									</div>

					<p>As far as I remember, Juniiper SA series provides only HTTPS access. The communication between the client side (ActiveX or Java plugins) and the device is somehow proprietary HTTPS tunneled data. </p><p>Maybe someone can correct me if I&#039;m wrong but those appliances support neither IPsec nor OpenVPN. Therefore no chance to build connections from OpenWrt. Usually in front of an SSL gateway you will find the &quot;real&quot; VPN site to site concentrator. If you really need the connection this should be your point of interest you want to connect to.</p>									</div>

					<p>Very interesting indeed. </p><p>I have no pictures of how to configure a SA2500 but the documentation and this picture <a href="http://kb.juniper.net/library/CUSTOMERSERVICE/GLOBAL_JTAC/BK21321/BK21321-3.jpg">http://kb.juniper.net/library/CUSTOMERS â€¦ 1321-3.jpg</a> give the indication that only IKEv2 is supported. The OpenWrt WIKI pages are all about racoon that only supports IKEv1.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>birnenschnitzel</strong> on 3 Feb 2012, 14:55)</p>
