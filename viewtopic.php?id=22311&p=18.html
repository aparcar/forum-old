					<p>Hey jow, great to see developers reading these threads and responding. I have a quick question. I have been going back and forth between the lastest trunk release of OpenWRT and Netgear&#039;s stock firmware for some quick comparisons. I have to say, OpenWRT has come a far way on this router, but the 2.4GHz range still seems to be a bit better with the stock firmware.</p><p>I know that displayed signal quality doesn&#039;t necessarily mean anything, but this is not the case here. At the edge of OpenWRT&#039;s usable range (where it&#039;s struggling to push ~500Kb/s-1Mb iperf), the Netgear firmware with the same client, in the same area manages to get around 4-5Mb/s. My settigns are as follows:</p><p>2.4Ghz radio, HT20, Channel 1 on both OpenWRT and the Netgear firmware.</p><p>Both firmwares are reporting 20dBm txpower at these settings. My client is a laptop with an R52N. Similar results can be obtained with other less reliable clients (such as mobile phones).</p><p>Do you guys have any idea what the discrepancy might be due to? I understand that Netgear uses proprietary binary drivers, that might also include code for antenna selection that might not be completely understood yet? </p><p>All in all, great work with OpenWRT, ath9k, and this router in general. I am very thankful, as I&#039;m sure the rest of the community is. I was just wondering if you might have any insight on this. Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>hello!</p><p>i&#039;d like to flash the original netgear firmware (from dd-wrt) and i have a problem.<br />i have flashed this firmware version (<a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14244">http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14244</a>) to my wndr3700 with tftp. this worked fine i think because after flashing the router wants me to type in user and password. (accessing over <a href="http://www.routerlogin.net">www.routerlogin.net</a>)<br />now my problem: user &quot;admin&quot; and password &quot;password&quot; is not working. same with &quot;admin&quot; and &quot;1234&quot; (1234 was the pwd on older devices.)<br />i have tried several hard resets, but no success.<br />anyone knows what to do? thanks!</p><p>got it to work:<br />image file from the resource cd and a long enough reset (till the power led is blinking orange) after the flash with the TFTP method.<br />Solved! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Anubilu</strong> on 26 Sep 2010, 00:51)</p>

					<p>So I have been experimenting with the latest trunk releases and comparing them to the stock Netgear firmware. Specifically I&#039;ve been looking at wireless performance, because Netgear doesn&#039;t hold a candle to OpenWRT in any other respect.</p><p>Ath9k sure has come a long way since I first tested OpenWRT at first with this router. In strong signal areas, it just about matches, and in some cases beats the wireless throughput of the stock Netgear firmware. The only remaining issue I notice is range. It seems as both radios show a ~5-6db decrease in signal strength at every distance, with all my different clients. I use Channel 1 HT20 for the 2.4GHz and Channel 153 HT40- on the 5GHz radio just for reference. This is my setup with the stock firmware as well.</p><p>The reduced range seems strange to me. The stock Netgear firmware reports the 2.4 radio at 20dbm and the 5 radio at 18dbm. Maybe the Netgear firmware has an offset that it&#039;s not reporting? Either way, I was just wondering if anyone else is seeing similar behavior, and if so, hopefully call it to the developers attention to see if they might have any other tricks up their sleeves to bring the range up to stock firmware levels.</p><p>**Edit**<br />After looking at the fcc documentation <a href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=1150511">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplic … id=1150511</a> it seems as though there really is a 5-6 dbm offset between what Netgear reports, and the actual output. Again, Netgear reports 20 and 18 dbm respectively for 2.4GHz and high channels of 5GHz, but the documents show a max output of 26 and ~23 dbm in those channels respectively. Hopefully that is something meaningful?</p><p>Thanks as always.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>antsh</strong> on 29 Sep 2010, 08:10)</p>

					<p>*** Bump ***<br />Any idea please ?</p><br /><p>Hello,</p><p>As a new owner of a wndr3700 router (to replace my old WRT54GS), I&#039;m also new to this forum so please be indulgent if I post in the wrong place or my question is badly asked (english is not my native language).</p><p>I&#039;ve put backfire 10.03.1 for wndr3700 release in my router (http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wndr3700-jffs2-factory.img ) and all is ok except one of my devices, a belkin iCam200g, can&#039;t connect wirelessly with the 2.4GHz link, using WPA2 encryption (well, is doesn&#039;t work with other encryptions scheme either...). However, the connection works perfectly with the netgear stock firmware.</p><p>In the system log, I get a bunch of messages like this :<br />Deauthenticated due to local deauth request<br />I found that there was an opened ticket #7413 (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7413">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7413</a>) for a similar related problem, but I can&#039;t figure why my cam is the only device which has this (smartphone, game console and other devices connect without any problem).</p><p>Note that I also tried with the last (beta) dd-wrt release and got the same behaviour so I suppose it is 2.6 branch wireless driver related. In the auto-refresh status page, I can see the cam is constantly appearing/disappearing in the connected devices list and the displayed link rate is 104MB or 154MB (????), which is really strange because the cam is supposed to only support IEEE802.11b/g, so a maximum 54MB rate.</p><p>Would you have some idea about this ?<br />Thanks in advance for your help.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fazer666</strong> on 25 Oct 2010, 13:17)</p>

					<p>I am running Backfire 10.03.1 (build 20728) on my WNDR3700 for quite a while now...</p><p>What I noticed is, that establishing a wifi connection takes much longer as with my OpenWRT-device before (Linksys). Obtaining an IP address by DHCP takes also longer. The wifi connection (2.4 GHz) also seems to be a little unstable. (Connection cannot be used anymore after a while like it is described here: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7363">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7363</a> ) I am experiencing those problems on a Netbook (HP mini 5102, broadcom wifi), a Laptop (Lenovo T61p with Intel AGN), another Laptop (FSC Amilo running Windows, Intel BG) and an Internet Tablet (Nokia N800).</p><p>Can anyone confirm this problem? Does anyone know more about it? </p><p>How can I find out more details in order to provide them to the developers?</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance for your answers!</p>									</div>
