					<p>Hi all,</p><p>After I load up Luci, and go the the &quot;Network&quot; tab, I noticed that no matter what I do, when I press &quot;Save and Apply&quot;, the &quot;Applying changes&quot; would never complete the loading.</p><p>On the status bar (left bottom corner of Firefox), it always shows &quot;Transferring data from 192.168.1.1 ...&quot;.&nbsp; And the page just keeps loading for hrs.</p><p>Since it so happens that the 802.11s I wanted to try out is no working yet, I am just wondering if the above problem has anything to do with it.&nbsp; That is, is my changes actually saved?</p><p>Does this problem indicate that something is missed in the code (or menuconfig)?</p><p>Thanks very much in advnce.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Robert.</p>									</div>
