					<p>I am trying to build the trunk after few months and I am stuck with:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>scripts/feeds install ntpd
WARNING: No feed for package &#039;ntpd&#039; found, maybe it&#039;s already part of the standard packages?</code></pre></div><p>Of course it is not a part of standard packages. Only ntpd found in standard packages is the one coming with busybox, which I am not interested in. It seems ntpd package was removed from package list (but openntpd is still there). Does anyone know why? Is this a permanent solution? I have been using ntpd for many years without problem and would like to continue using it.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>risa2000</strong> on 27 Jul 2014, 13:37)</p>
