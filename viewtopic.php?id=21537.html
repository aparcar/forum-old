					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve managed to flash (8.09.1) openwrt-atheros-ubnt2-pico2-squasfs.bin onto the PicoStation2<br />Everything seems to work OK except for the following:</p><p>1) The amount of packets dropped is extremely high (about half of those transmitted)<br />---<br /> RX packets:972 errors:0 dropped:509 overruns:0 frame:0<br /> TX packets:461 errors:0 dropped:367 overruns:0 carrier:0<br />---</p><p>2.) The channel still &#039;hops&#039; even if I set it to be on a specific one. It will initially start off on the specified one, but later I find it changed. Is this normal?</p><p>Any one using the PicoStation NOT having these problems or ALSO having these problems?</p><p>Besides the above problems it works well. <br />I configured it to have two VAPs. One is bridged with a OpenVPN tunnel to a captive portal (no encryption) and the other uses WPA2 Enterprise encryption.</p><p>I had lots of trouble with the Linksys and WPA2 Enterprise encryption.</p><p>Feedback will be much appreciated</p>									</div>
