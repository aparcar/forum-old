					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039; have a WNDR3300 with OpenWRT v10.03.1 that used to work reasonably well.</p><p>How I regret I didn&#039;t resist the temptation and flashed: openwrt-15.05.1-brcm47xx-legacy-squashfs.trx.</p><p>And the router appears to be at least &quot;soft&quot; bricked: after each reboot, I get a slowly flashing power LED, ping responds with ttl=100.</p><p>However, I tftp multiple times, right after I see the first ttl=100, with several firmware that used to work (the original, a mini ddwrt, and openwrt v10.03.1). tftp would still report file successfully transferred, but none of these firmware work, as in, 15 minutes later I&#039;d reboot the router, and I still get ttl=100.</p><p>I&#039;m on a mac, so the tftp cmd I used are:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>connect 192.168.1.1
binary
rexmt 1
timeout 60
put openwrt.bin</code></pre></div><p>where openwrt.bin is the then-working v7.09 firmware. I also tried v10.03.1 and a ddwrt mini firmware, both were working with this router but now wouldn&#039;t.</p><p>Did I not doing tftp correctly?</p><p>Could you please kindly help me debrick it?</p><p>I read on ddwrt that the WNDR3300 recovery ultility might work:<br />dd-wrt dot com/wiki/index.php/Netgear_WNDR3300#Netgear_Firmware_Recovery_Utility</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If flashing the router with tftp is unsuccessful, and you have a flashing power light with a ping response of TTL=100, the unit may still be recoverable using the Netgear Firmware Recovery Utility.</p></blockquote></div><p>But the file, WNDR3300_230-10591-04v2.3.zip, is nowhere to be found.</p><p>Any idea is appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>I just unbricked my soft-bricked WND3700v5--really moments ago! I recognize the unability to ping and connect with tftp to the router: After bricking it just seemed not to have an IP address anymore.</p><p>So I soldered on a header on the holes for the serial port and plugged in the TTL2USB adapter. (If you haven&#039;t got one, get on with an FTDI chip, get headers and get cables to connect the two. I can&#039;t post links, so pm me if you want my shopping list. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> I got them for less than 4â‚¬ via AliEpress, but it takes up to a month to arrive.)<br />On Linux I checked which port it registered on with </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ls -larth /dev | grep uucp</code></pre></div><p> I got /dev/ttyUSB0. Then I started </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>minicom -s</code></pre></div><p>, configured the serial connection to /dev/ttyUSB0, the speed to 57600 b/s, 8 N 1 and no flow control. <br />After starting the router a lot of info flows over the screen, until the point it tell you to press Ctrl-C. Press Ctrl-C and you get a prompt. The rest of the info I got from a file posted by ldpinney in the WND3700v5 thread:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>You MUST have a working serial console (UART)

					<p>Thanks! I couldn&#039;t find a way to send PM but I looked up FTDI USB to TTL adapters on Amazon and AliExpress.</p><p>The FTDI adapters have rigid pins without soft cables, and their pin configurations do not appear to match with WNDR3300, so do I also need cables?</p><p>According to ddwrt wndr3300 wiki, the pin configuration on WNDR3300 is this:</p><p>Pin 1 = 3.3V (towards the front of the router and should have &quot;1&quot; silk screened near the pin)<br />Pin 2 = RXD<br />Pin 3 = n/c<br />Pin 4 = n/c<br />Pin 5 = TXD<br />Pin 6 = GND (towards the rear of the PCB/back of router).</p><p>You mentioned how you couldn&#039;t get ping response. I still could with ttl=100, does soldering required? I&#039;m fine with serial but not so confident with soldering.</p><p>Edit: I opened up the box and I now understand what you meant: the serial ports don&#039;t have headers, so we need to solder on headers, gotcha.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>CaptainNemo</strong> on 12 Jan 2017, 08:01)</p>

					<p>@mk24 Good tot hear! I still have one in the mail since November. The CH340&#039;s did give me that crappy experience and I was warned about fakes on the mobileread forum (search for serial connection in the Kobo developer&#039;s corner): No idea if they actually work, though. I think both 2303&#039;s and FTDI were recommended. The resulting FTDI panned out good, so I only forwarded that piece of the advice.</p><p>When or if I ever get the cable with the PL2303 chip, I&#039;ll test it and post the experience.</p><p>@CaptainNemo There is a header with 3 pins and a jumper shorting 2 of them. Change the jumper and you switch voltage. Just be sure to measure that the end result between ground (GRD?) and the other pins is 3.3V.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Markismus</strong> on 13 Jan 2017, 15:33)</p>
