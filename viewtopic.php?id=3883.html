					<p>Hello,</p><p>Shorewall-3.0 is finally ported. </p><p>The .ipk package - as well as the full upstream SDK source - can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://sfl.homelinux.net/openwrt/">http://sfl.homelinux.net/openwrt/</a><br /><a href="http://people.softwarelivre.org/~alberto/openwrt/">http://people.softwarelivre.org/~alberto/openwrt/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Tanks for the Help Bengoa <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )</p><p>I sugest the reading of README.OpenWRT before installing. That file is installed on your system with the rest of the files but most people will like to remove it to save some space.</p><p>The package is based on the current stable version (3.0.3) and seems to be running fine. Please, send the bugs/problems to: sfl.openwrt@terra.com.br</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Fabio Longarai Silva &lt;longarai@terra.com.br&gt;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>longarai</strong> on 2 Jan 2006, 20:34)</p>

					<p>Thanks for the package.&nbsp; I just installed it and tried to start it with a mostly default configuration. When I run &quot;shorewall start&quot; it goes along looking fine until it runs the /usr/share/shorewall/firewall script, at which point, one of the iptables commands fails. Here is the relevant output:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
Creating Interface Chains...

Setting up NETMAP...
Adding Common Rules
iptables v1.3.3: Unknown arg `--log-level&#039;
Try `iptables -h&#039; or &#039;iptables --help&#039; for more information.
   ERROR: Command &quot;/usr/sbin/iptables -A smurfs -s 192.168.72.255  -j  LOG  --log-level info --log-prefix &quot;Shorewall:smurfs:DROP:&quot;&quot; Failed

I think this is all related to the fact that I do not have /usr/lib/iptables/libipt_LOG.so.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find that file in the version that I need (iptables 1.3.3) from any of the feeds.&nbsp; Basically I was wondering if you had found a copy of that file somewhere or if you use ulog on your system and thus haven&#039;t run into this problem?</p><p>I&#039;m running White Russian RC4 with an almost completely stock configuration. Thanks for any suggestions.</p><p>-John X</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello John, tanks for the reply.</p><p>Your&#039;e probably missing iptables-mod-extra.</p><p>The strange thing is that it&#039;s listed as a dependency so you shouldn&#039;t be able to install shorewall3 without it. This iptables-mod-extra package depends of the kmod-ipt-extra that has the correspondent kernel modules.</p><p>Did you installed shorewall with --force option?</p><p>Anyway, just install &#039;iptables-mod-extra&#039; (with &#039;kmod-ipt-extra&#039;), &#039;iptables-utils&#039; and &#039;ip&#039; and you should be ready to go.</p><p>Regards, </p><p>Fabio Longarai &lt;longarai@terra.com.br&gt;</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; I found the problem. I had added the &quot;experimental&quot; feed to my ipkg.conf file and because of that had iptables-extra installed instead of iptables-mod-extra.&nbsp; I removed that package and shorewall then removed the &quot;experimental&quot; feed from my ipkg.conf, and reinstalled shorewall.&nbsp; It pulled in the correct dependency and all is well.&nbsp; Thank you very much for packaging shorewall.&nbsp; OpenWRT and Shorewall on my WRT54GS leave me so much more sane than trying to deal with my old 802.11b Linksys router.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi supernaut,</p><p>Yes, pre-saved rulesets are incredibly faster to load then the usual script execution.</p><p>The next version of shorewall will bring a nice &#039;shorewall generate&#039; command that will build a script for <br />further loading. It will make shorewall a true &#039;rulesets generator&#039;.</p><p>One nice thing is that this &#039;generate&#039; command can be run in one machine and the generated file can<br />be executed from another...</p><p>Another fine thing is length match support for tcrules. It will - among other things - help on holding p2p<br />uploads without slowing down your dowloads.</p><p>IÂ´m currently testing this development versions in openwrt environment, If anyone here want to try it <br />(and help testing) please mail me - I can send fresh a .ipk package.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Longarai</p>									</div>
