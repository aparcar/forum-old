					<p>Hello, </p><p>I just installed OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk. I managed to configure my wan, wi-fi and that&#039;s pretty much it. </p><p>I&#039;m not able to modify the config files anymore. </p><p>If i try in Luci to add a firewall rule, create or delete a dropbear instance or anything, once I click apply &amp; save it gui tells me it&#039; s applying the changes and everything. Once the page refreshes, the configuration is actually unchanged. </p><p>If i try to modify a conf file in vi, I hit wq, afterwards I reopen my file, mychanges aren&#039;t there...</p><p>Anyone knows what&#039;s the issue?</p><p>Regards, <br />Diez</p>									</div>

					<p>Try flashing that file again. Download it again and make sure the MD5sum matches. Or reset to defaults.</p><p>The other thing to check - did you install a lot of packages? That router doesn&#039;t have much flash memory. If you fill it up, you may not be able to save settings.</p>									</div>
