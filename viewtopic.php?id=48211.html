					<p>A couple of months ago Comcast enabled IPv6 in my area and I upgraded my home router to OpenWrt Barrier Breaker r38999 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r9939) so I could enable it and learn about IPv6 first hand.</p><p>The basic setup is working well (Thanks for all your hard work!), but now I want to setup host names for some of my devices, especially my &quot;servers&quot;. For IPv4 I&#039;ve assigned static leases for several devices, so I can &quot;ssh server&quot; instead of &quot;ssh 192.168.1.10&quot; and I&#039;d like to do the same thing for IPv6.</p><p>As there isn&#039;t a static lease section for DHCPv6, I setup a hostname entry last month and it was working for a while but then Comcast assigned me a different Prefix and my hostname entries broke.</p><p>I&#039;m still new to IPv6, is there a way to assign a hostname to a Device-ID that can be automatically added to DNSmasq? If not, do you have any suggestions for host name assignment to a dynamic IPv6 address? Or different tools to use?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Brian</p>									</div>

					<p>As a workaround, you could use link local addresses (fe80::/64), which are always available in addition to the globally routable ones.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi slh,</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p><p>Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but my understanding is that link-local addresses aren&#039;t guaranteed to be unique except on that link, and that their main function is for router assignment and IPv6 address negotiation, and that they really weren&#039;t meant for use at the application layer?</p><p>While I was looking at the Network -&gt; Interfaces page in Luci again I noticed that there is a Unique Local Address[1] prefix (fd00::/8) which has similarities to IPv4 private networks.</p><p>So I&#039;ve create a couple of hostname entries for those addresses and I&#039;ll see how that works out in the long run.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Brian</p><br /><p>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi zloop,</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>You are right. You should not use link-local adresses</p></blockquote></div><p>It&#039;s good to know I&#039;m understanding some of what I&#039;m learning. :-)</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>- OpenWrt uses 6relayd as a DHCPv6 server. see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/6relayd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/6relayd</a></p></blockquote></div><p>I did enter a couple of leases using luci and they are entered into the /etc/config/6relayd file as described in the link.</p><p>As an aside, I was having trouble finding a DUID for my linux server. After some digging I found you can generate the DUID using &quot;sudo dhclient -D LL&quot;. Then you can copy/paste in luci to create new leases.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>- there is dnsmasq with DHCPv6 support available - maybe you can type in ipv6 adresses in static leases when you install it ? ( .lan )</p></blockquote></div><p>There are 2 static lease sections in luci. One for IPv4 that allows you to assign host names, and IPs to MAC addresses, and the IPv6 static leases which allow you to assign device-ids to DUIDs.</p><p>dnsmasq allows you to create hostname entries with IPv6 addresses, but if the v6 address changes then the host name entry becomes stale Which was my original problem when Comcast assigned me a new prefix.</p><p>Using the 6relayd static leases in combination with the dnsmasq hostname entries seems to be the only option right now. </p><p>However I&#039;d love to be able to do something like:</p><p>/etc/config/dhcp:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;host&#039;
    option &#039;name&#039; &#039;server&#039;
    option &#039;ip&#039;   &#039;192.168.1.10&#039;
    option &#039;device-id&#039; &#039;::a&#039;
    option &#039;mac&#039;  &#039;01:23:45:67:89:AB&#039;</code></pre></div><p>and have it generate IPv4 entries, as well as complete IPv6 addresses (from the ISP assigned prefix, and the supplied device-id), and automatically enter/update all of it in the DHCP and DNS caches. That would be outstanding!</p><p>Thanks,<br />Brian</p>									</div>
