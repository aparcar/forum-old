					<p>Hey guys</p><p>My ISP i currently have uses one of those proprietary piece of crap all in one modem router and <br />basic 802.11a/b wifi, and does not allow router behind router instances due to (proprietary) software restrictions. <br />I have a netgear 600 wndr3700v2, with Openwrt installed (obviously, that&#039;s why i&#039;m here) with default configuration.</p><p>Simply put, i would like to pick up the wifi from that router and rebroadcast it with my wndr3700 as a separate network, just for internet.<br />Also, for convenience use the 10.0.0.x range. This should be pretty straightforward , however the configuration looks a bit complex to me, especially the vast amount of options in the settings page. </p><br /><p>How would i go about acheiving this?</p><p>Sidenote: I am looking into other isps without this pathetic childish mandatory crap hardware and spyware they install in your home.</p><br /><br /><p>any guidance would be enormously appreciated!!</p>									</div>

					<p>In a nutshell - you should connect wirelessly to your ISP, create an AP where your home devices will connect and activate NAT on the wan connection.<br />Edit /etc/config/wireless like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-iface
    option device &#039;radio0&#039;
    option network &#039;lan&#039;
    option mode &#039;ap&#039;
    option ssid &#039;Home&#039;
    option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;
    option key &#039;bigsecret&#039;
    option disabled &#039;0&#039;

config wifi-iface
    option device &#039;radio0&#039;
    option network &#039;wan&#039;
    option mode &#039;sta&#039;
    option encryption &#039;psk2&#039;
    option ssid &#039;MyISP_Router_SSID&#039;
    option key &#039;biggersecret&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Edit /etc/config/network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface wan
    option proto dhcp</code></pre></div><p>Reboot or issue the command &quot;/etc/init.d/network restart&quot;. You should now be connected to your ISP and have the Home SSID visible.<br />The last step is to activate NAT (masquerading) for your wan connection. This can be done from Luci (if you use Luci) or by editing /etc/config/firewall<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config zone
        option name             wan
        list   network          &#039;wan&#039;
        list   network          &#039;wan6&#039;
        option input            REJECT
        option output           ACCEPT
        option forward          REJECT
        option masq             1</code></pre></div><p>(I think these are the default options, anyway.)<br />Then <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>/etc/init.d/firewall enable
/etc/init.d/firewall start</code></pre></div><p>That should be it.</p>									</div>

					<p>- I think that it can be done entirely from Luci, but I&#039;m not sure, as I don&#039;t use Luci<br />- you could install nano, which is more user friendly (opkg update; opkg install nano)<br />- anyway, basic vi is easy to learn, there are only a few combinations to know (i - for editing, ESC:x for saving, ESC:q! for quitting without saving and that&#039;s all you need to know to start)<br />Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>It seems to have worked, kinda<br />When i say kinda, i mean it establishes a connection with my isps router,<br />(which verifies the configuration is correct *thank you) but only for a couple seconds until it drops and disconnects<br />and the bitrate is a horrid 1mbps despite being less than 8 feet away from each-other</p><br /><p>any ideas?</p><p>just fyi the wndr3700 also has another 5ghz wifi radio labeled &#039;radio1&#039;&nbsp; if needed</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>opensircut</strong> on 15 Apr 2015, 11:07)</p>

					<p>- you should check that both wifi connections are created (iw dev, check that you have 2 interfaces here, one of them type AP and the other type &quot;managed&quot;). Check with logread if something is wrong.<br />- check if the &quot;managed&quot; interface received IP via DHCP from ISP&#039;s router<br />- ping something from the Internet (e.g. 8.8.8.8) from the router to check connectivity<br />- if all of the above tests are successful, you can connect to Home SSID and still have no Internet access, you should recheck if NAT (masquerading) is activated for the &quot;outside&quot; wireless interface&nbsp; <br />- don&#039;t worry about the 1Mbps rate shown (by Luci?). My guess is that when you will have traffic on the link it will be a lot higher</p>									</div>

					<p>Looks good (mostly), except that somehow in your setup lan and wan are bridged.<br />maybe you should start new and try to make it like this:<br />WiFi<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GGvqr28.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/GGvqr28.jpg" /></span><br />WAN<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bPlLExG.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/bPlLExG.jpg" /></span><br />LAN<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jrTRAwk.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/jrTRAwk.jpg" /></span><br />Firewall looks fine.</p><p>Logread is what you see in System log menu.</p><p>Good luck!</p>									</div>

					<p>so i reset to defaults and decided to see how far i got with luci<br /> -moved the wan port to lan<br />- setup my wifi&#039;s (ssid &amp; password for both radios)<br />- used luci and scanned wifi nearby, (via add new interface) connected to my router as client <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(MUST create new interface &quot;wwan&quot;. wouldn&#039;t let me just add to current &quot;wan&quot; -weird) <br />-move new interface to wan (from the wwan it just made)<br />-delete wwan<br />so basically using the wan port for an extra lan port, and using wifi as wan<br />firewall is defaults<br />but still no internet<br />so im confused why this is not working</p>									</div>
