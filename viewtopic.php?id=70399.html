					<p>Firstly, I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place to be posting, but this seems like the most active router hacking/reverse engineering forum.</p><p>I&#039;m cursed with a Pace 5286AC and want to replace the firmware with something more useful. I don&#039;t need the wifi functionality, just the base SOC and ethernet ports. I suspect that&#039;s an achievable endeavor.</p><p>I&#039;ve already found the serial port and logged boot. I posted it to wikidevi (this forum won&#039;t let me link.. boo)</p><p>The u-boot is locked down and cannot be interrupted. It also requires a login and the password doesn&#039;t seem to be anything obvious, or derived from the SSID/WPA password/etc.</p><p>Short of getting my hands on a firmware (doubtful), I think my next best option is to extract the nand flash and go through it. Hopefully it&#039;s not encrypted.</p><p>I have a donor unit and the tools/soldering skills to remove the chip, but I don&#039;t have a proper nand reader handy. Does anybody have a socketed nand reader? I&#039;ll happily remove and mail the chip for extraction.</p><p>Finally, I&#039;ve had a heck of a time finding the GPL releases related to this device. With the acquisition of Pace by Arris, they shutdown Pace&#039;s github account and refer it all to Arris. They don&#039;t seem to name the repos the same as the device models, so I&#039;m totally lost. Am I missing something with how they do it?</p>									</div>
