					<p>Hi,<br />Just upgraded from 7.09 brcm-2.4 to 10.03 brcm-47xx on a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54.<br />Thanks for the hardwork. Wireless seems reliable, if a little slow, so far.</p><p>One problem I have is trying to getting &#039;hairpin&#039; routing, so that LAN hosts can access other hosts on the LAN via the WAN IP address.<br />i.e. so p2p clients behind the router can access each other just as hosts from the internet can.</p><p>So, &quot;telnet &lt;WANIP&gt; &lt;port&gt;&quot; will work from the internet and the intranet, hitting whichever host port &lt;port&gt; is forwarded to incoming from the internet.</p><p>I used custom iptables command in /etc/firewall.user with 7.09 to achieve this, cos the firewall script didn&#039;t support it.<br />I hoped that this wasn&#039;t the case on 10.03 and see in the wiki the mention of SNAT. So I had a play. Nothing I tried would<br />get SNAT to appear in the iptables.<br />So I had a look in the script /lib/firewall/uci_firewall.sh. I can see DNAT in there, but no SNAT at all.<br />Is this really supported?</p><p>I used to have the following in /etc/firewall.user:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>WANIP=`ifconfig $WAN | awk &#039;/inet addr:/ { sub(/addr:/, &quot;&quot;); print $2 }&#039;`

hairpin () {
  do_hairpin $1 $2 tcp
  do_hairpin $1 $2 udp
}

do_hairpin () {
  # from intranet to intranet host (using double NAT)
  iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d $WANIP -p $3 --dport $1 -j DNAT --to $2
  iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p $3 --dport $1 -d $2 -j SNAT --to $WANIP

  # from internet to intranet 
  iptables -t nat -A prerouting_wan -p $3 -m multiport --dports $1 -j DNAT --to $2
  iptables        -A forwarding_wan    -d $2     -j ACCEPT
}

hairpin 27588 192.168.1.4
hairpin 31745 192.168.1.4
hairpin 59287 192.168.1.4

do_hairpin 80 192.168.1.2 tcp
do_hairpin 25 192.168.1.2 tcp</code></pre></div><p>I&#039;ve updated the do_hairpin function to:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>do_hairpin () {
  iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d $WANIP -p $3 --dport $1 -j DNAT --to $2
  iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p $3 --dport $1 -d $2 -j SNAT --to $WANIP

  iptables -A zone_wan_prerouting -t nat -p $3 -m multiport --dports $1 -j DNAT --to $2
  iptables -I zone_wan_forward 1 -p $3 -d $2 --dport $1 -j ACCEPT
}</code></pre></div><p>The port forwarding works (the 2nd two statements), but the hairpin (the 1st two statements) of the WANIP back into the intranet does not.<br />Any ideas why?<br />Thanks for your help guys.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>gildenman</strong> on 1 Oct 2010, 12:25)</p>

  # from intranet to intranet host (using double NAT)

  iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d $WANIP -p $3 --dport $1 -j DNAT --to $2

  iptables -I zone_wan_forward 1 -p $3 -d $2 --dport $1 -j ACCEPT

					<p>I&#039;ve been struggling through the exact same problem and since google keeps bringing me here, I think I should post what I&#039;ve done for others who have the same problem. I&#039;m using Chaos Calmer 15.05.</p><p>The problem: Some people like my use dynamic dns and run a server from our home. Accessing the sever via dynamic dns and/or the public ip address works from everywhere except from home. The &quot;hairpin&quot; code below sets up your firewall so that you can use the public IP address or your dynamic dns entry to access your server instead of its real ip address on the lan. This of course makes life much better because now you can access your server the same way and it won&#039;t matter if you&#039;re at home, or somewhere else.</p><p>I had problems with the firewall getting setup before comcast had a chance to give me an IP, so that&#039;s why the sleep is there (yuck!). Really we&#039;re just waiting to get an IP. You might not need to sleep.</p><p><strong>This modified code only does the &quot;hairpin.&quot; I&#039;ve configured the port 80 forward from the wan -&gt; 192.168.0.10 using the web ui. </strong></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#wait to make sure dhcp has time to give us an IP on the WAN :)
sleep 15
WANIP=$(ifconfig eth1 | grep inet | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | awk -F &#039;addr:&#039; &#039;{print $2}&#039;)
do_hairpin () {
  iptables -t nat -A prerouting_rule -d $WANIP -p $3 --dport $1 -j DNAT --to $2
  iptables -t nat -A postrouting_rule -s 192.168.0/24 -p $3 --dport $1 -d $2 -j SNAT --to $WANIP
}

# Allow the lan to access the web server who&#039;s ip is 192.168.0.10 on the lan using the routers public ip address
