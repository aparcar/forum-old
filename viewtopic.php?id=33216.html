					<p>Hi. I have Tp-Link WR1043ND box with openwrt rc6 on it (compiled with extroot). I tried to setup traffic shaper and got problem. I compiled and installed kmod-ipt-ipopt and iptables-ipopt. After that I added iptables rule: iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -p udp -d 192.168.10.149/32 -j MARK --set-mark 0x33 </p><p>some seconds later openwrt rebooted. I tried that several times and found that kernel panic happens after first udp packet went to 192.168.10.149/32.</p><p>There are no console at this box (I can&#039;t open it). Is there any way to generate crash dump in swap area (flash) and check it later to found a crash reason ?</p>									</div>
