					<p>Hi,</p><p>Since there are no official releases for Netgear WNDR3700v2 I had to compile my own version with directions from the forum.<br />Everything went fine and after flashing my router starts as it should.<br />After all the initial setup [root password, starting wifi etc] I wanted to reboot the device to make sure everything is ok.<br />Unfortunately after the reboot device goes to recovery mode and the green light keeps on blinking.<br />I&#039;ve tried flashing one more time, set the root password only and rebooted the device to end up in recovery mode again <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /><br />Could anyone tell me how can I find out what the hell is going on?<br />I can&#039;t connect router serial interface so this method is not possible.</p><p>Maybe there&#039;s something obvious I&#039;ve missed when configuring openwrt?<br />I&#039;ve followed the guide from wiki: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700</a></p><p>It&#039;s almost 4am in here and can&#039;t think about anything at the moment <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>All help appreciated.</p>									</div>
