					<p>Hello all. First time post. I am using an XFTA Dongle (Wireless Router) that is running OpenWrt Backfire 10.03 (Load: 0.08 0.02 0.01)</p><p>I am able to enter into the units&#039; configuration with a very simple User Name: root - Password: admin. That was a no-brainer.</p><p>However once logged in, I then proceed to enter the units IP address eg 192.168.0.28:48000 and am presented with this screen. Can someone kindly assist me in identifying what exactly is located / loaded at that IP location. Thank you.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/q005.jpg" alt="PunBB bbcode test" /></span></p><p>I was wondering if perhaps this is some type of third party client that would allow me to enter my private xfta server information?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Osteele</strong> on 20 Mar 2013, 14:57)</p>
