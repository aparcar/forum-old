					<p>I&#039;ve just released Fault Tolerant Router, a tool to manage the status and generate config for multiple internet uplinks. It&#039;s quite well described on the project page, I needn&#039;t repeat it here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/drsound/fault_tolerant_router">https://github.com/drsound/fault_tolerant_router</a></p><p>The tool is written in Ruby and not OpenWrt specific, but maybe an OpenWrt package will follow. Meanwhile I would like somebody to test it on OpenWrt. Thank you.</p>									</div>

					<p>I will absolutely test this!&nbsp; You have no idea how fortuitous the timing is on this, I&#039;ve been struggling to load balance a pair of openvpn tun interfaces for the last few days, with no luck getting it working, so hopefully this does the trick.&nbsp; I just saw an article about it on /., checked out the github, and then did a quick search to see if anyone had it working on openwrt.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;ll be among the first to try it out.</p><p>I&#039;ll post results here as soon as I&#039;m able (I&#039;m on-call at work right now, so it depends on after hours alarms).</p>									</div>

					<p>I have used mwan3 previously, it is a bit tricky to get it up and working, but once it is working it does what it says.<br />I&#039;m also interested in testing your new tool so I can compare it to mwan3. Thanks.</p>									</div>
