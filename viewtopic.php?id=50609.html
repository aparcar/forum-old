					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I am a newbie and am trying to change the operating frequency of WiFi card. I am using RB433AH and the WiFi card uses ath5k drivers. I want to change the channel 1 center frequency to 2382 MHz instead of 2412 MHz. I searched a little and found that it is possible (<a href="http://www.qsl.net/kb9mwr/projects/wireless/modify.html">http://www.qsl.net/kb9mwr/projects/wireless/modify.html</a>). </p><p>I am using attitude_adjustment 12.09. I tried seacrhing for the drivers that are resposible for the frequency and saw the frequency dependency only in hostapd, compat-wireless and iw3.6. The channel frequency is set in each of these drivers using </p><p>freq = 2407 + chan * 5;</p><p>I changed the value 2407 to 2377 (in iw3.6/util.c, compat-wireless-2014-01-23.1/include/linux/ieee80211.h and compat-wireless-2014-01-23.1/net/wireless/util.c) so that my channel 1 center frequency becomes 2382 MHz. I also set the value&nbsp; caps-&gt;cap_range.range_2ghz_min = 2312 (which was 2412 by default) in compat-wireless-2014-01-23.1/drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/caps.c</p><p>Now coming to the problem: The channel frequencies do get changed. <br />I added a printk(KERN_DEBUG &quot;ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = %d&quot;, freq) in the iw3.6/util.c</p><p>I set the channel to 1 in the /etc/config/wireless file.<br />When I enable wireless and restart the network, I get the following </p><p>ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2382<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2387<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2392<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2397<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2402<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2407<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2412<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2417<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2422<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2427<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2432<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2437<br />ieee80211_frequency_to_channel: freq = 2442</p><p>However, now, if I check the list of frquencies, I get</p><p>iwlist frequency</p><p>wlan0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7 channels in total; available frequencies :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel 07 : 2.412 GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel 08 : 2.417 GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel 09 : 2.422 GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel 10 : 2.427 GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel 11 : 2.432 GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel 12 : 2.437 GHz<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Channel 13 : 2.442 GHz</p><p>Also, channel 1 by default sets to channel 7 (2412 MHz).</p><p>I tried this for a few other frequencies, and what&#039;s happening is when I set the channel to 1, the channel is set to the one which has frequency more than 2412 MHz. Channel 2 translates to channel 8, channel 3 to channel 9 and so on.</p><p>What am I missing? I tried searching for conditions in the driver to check if it prevents from changing the frequency but did not get any. Wherever the driver checked a condition such as freq &gt;=2412, I replaced it with freq &gt;=2312. Are there more files where I need to make changes?</p><p>Again, I am rather new to studying and modifying the drivers; so pardon me if I have made any obvious errors. Any help is sincerely appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Gaurang</p>									</div>

					<p>Issue resolved.</p><p>I created a new regulatory domain with parameters : (2302000 KHz - 2402000 KHz @ 0 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)</p><p>However, that alone is not sufficient. The reg domain was first set to US and then to the one I created. So, it is necessary to change the parameters of US to that as above. Once that is done, issue is resolved.</p><p>Thanks!<br />Gaurang</p>									</div>
