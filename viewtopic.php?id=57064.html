					<p>I&#039;m trying to configure a DLink DIR-505L as a travel router. My problem is how to keep the WiFi for the LAN side running when the WiFi for the WAN side is not connected?</p><p>The DIR-505L has WiFi and a single ethernet port. On the LAN side, ETH1 bridged to a WiFi master and on the WAN side is a WiFi Client intended to connect to the hotel&#039;s WiFi. I&#039;m testing this using my phone as a hotspot and it works fine as long as the hotspot is running. If I turn off the phone&#039;s hotspot though, the LAN Wifi shuts down as well and I can no longer connect to the router. If I turn the phone&#039;s hotspot on again, the router connects up automatically and the LAN WiFi reappears.</p><p>Why does the status of the WAN WiFi client affect the status of the LAN WiFi master?</p><p>I really need the LAN side to stay up so I can connect to the router (wirelessly) and configure the WAN WiFi connection when I get to a hotel. </p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>This is an unfortunate consequence of using one radio hardware to do two things.&nbsp; When a client mode interface loses connection, the driver spends all the resource trying to find it again.&nbsp; Thus there is no direct fix.</p><p>See what worked for me here:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56758">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56758</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Hmmm. Well that&#039;s unfortunate.
