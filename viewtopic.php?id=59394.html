					<p>I installed openwrt rc3 on my TL-WR843ND in order to use it as a client to connect to an WPA2 Enterprise network.<br />Ive been messing around with it for 5 days and I believe i have come really close to finally getting it to work.<br />Right now Im stuck at the situation, where the router is ?not routing?. </p><p>The router has internet access, its able to ping sites and use the other diagnostic devices.<br />However, my computer is not. It cant ping, but it seems it has access to the DNS server since when i write ping <a href="http://www.neti.ee">www.neti.ee</a> -t, it shows the correct IP address. The network icon shows that i have internet access and i see that packets are being sent and received, but i cannot browse any websites.</p><p>I will post logs if they are required, maybe some of you can recognize the situation and know a fix or atleast the reason?<br />Ive given up 3 times on this router and today me finally able to connect the router as a Client to the Eduroam network was a huge success</p>									</div>
