					<p>Unfortunately it&#039;s too expensive for me to buy it and Netgear refused to send me a sample for adding support for it in Linux.</p><p>Another problem is that for writing wireless driver I would need PCIe card (like PCE-AC66) which is quite expensive too...</p><p>P.S.<br />If you find a serial console on your device, you can try booting ELF image (without overwriting current firmware) and we will know how well bcma&amp;friends support this device.

					<p>Yep.<br />Let&#039;s say I want to buy it on Amazon US, for US$ 180 + shipping. And international shipping is something like US$ 50<br />When it arrives here, I would have to pay 60% over that price (WITH shipping), so it would be a total of US$ 360 + some other tax that I don&#039;t understand... in the end, that&#039;s US$ 400.

They subscribe (with a monthly fee) to some US shipping company services located in US, i.e. Miami, FL, Houston, TX, etc. When they purchase the products from China (with free S/H to US) or Amazon, they use the US address provided by such a US shipping company service. When the package arrives, the US shipping company service will ship the product to their address in their country for a much less expensive fee + custom fee.</p>									</div>
