					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am planning a wireless network for a small company, but I am pretty unsure if what I want to do is possible. This is a diagram of what I want to do.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13764420/Setup.jpeg" alt="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13764420/Setup.jpeg" /></span></p><p>We have bought the Buffalo AG300H since this seems to be one of the best supported routers. We have a firewall running pfsense which captures everything from 192.168.20.X with a captive portal.<br />So what I want is:<br />1: A &quot;private&quot; wireless network with WPA2 radius authentication which is bridged so that clients connected to it are basically fully integrated into my subnet. DHCP and such will all be done by existing servers.<br />2: A &quot;public&quot; wireless network with WPA2 (password &#039;free&#039; so connections are encrypted). The WLan router should do DHCP and DNS (just dns forward of course). Connections should leave with an IP 192.168.20.X so the captive portal on the firewall can catch it. Also, by firewalling rules, openWRT should just allow connections to my firewall trough this public net,</p><p>No my questions are:<br />1: Can this be done with just one WAN connection or do I need to use a second one?<br />2: Do I need VLans (or switches) at all? On my hardware?</p><p>tia,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JÃ¶rg Herzinger</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>I made some progress meanwhile but I am still having troubles with the bridged client and firewall rules. This is my config so far:</p><p>/etc/rc.local<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip link add link eth1 name eth2 address 4C:E6:76:F9:01:01 type macvlan
ip link add link eth1 name eth3 address 4C:E6:76:F9:01:02 type macvlan
ifup -a</code></pre></div><p>/etc/config/network<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;intern&#039;
  option ifname &#039;eth2&#039;
  option type &#039;bridge&#039;
  option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;
  
config interface &#039;extern&#039;
  option ifname &#039;eth3&#039;
  option proto &#039;dhcp&#039;</code></pre></div><p>/etc/config/wireless<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config wifi-iface
    option device   radio1
    option network  extern
    option mode     ap
    option ssid     global2000-extern
    option encryption psk2
    option key    &#039;umweltschutz&#039;

config wifi-iface
    option device   radio1
    option network  intern
    option mode     ap
    option ssid     global2000-intern
    option encryption psk2
    option key    &#039;umweltschutz&#039;</code></pre></div><p>No firewall rules defined so far (for testing purposes). My extern and intern interfaces get their IP via my DHCP Server.<br />Now, when connecting to my wirless &quot;global2000-intern&quot; network my DHCP Server (not OpenWRT but the one that is used for my subnet) gets a request and answers, but my wireless client does not recieve it. Any ideas on what I am doing wrong? All of the firewall rules are listening to &quot;lan&quot; or &quot;wan&quot; so my &quot;intern&quot; and &quot;extern&quot; interfaces should be completely open, or am I wrong about that?</p>									</div>
