					<p>The &quot;make menuconfig&quot; menu is overwhelming with options and even after spending almost on hour on choosing everything, I suddenly realize I&#039;ve forgot something after installing it on the router already.<br />And the custom config files are also giving me problems.</p><p>Is there a way to take a stock (default) squashfs file that fits my router, install it and then use opkg install in order to get whatever I want.<br />Afterwards just use uci or vi to get all of my functions working as I want them to and after doing all of this I get to have the router that I want with the features that I want.</p><p>Can I then take all of these custom settings and the list of installed packages and use that as import to the &quot;menuconfig&quot; and then build a new squashfs image which is more compressed and more easily updated for future versions??</p><p>Going menu by menu and looking for stuff in menuconfig is hard work compared to doing it on the live router and then &quot;reverse engineering&quot; it. but how?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>DarkDaniel</strong> on 9 Aug 2012, 13:40)</p>

					<p>Linux &quot;menuconfig&quot; is not design for opkg thing, there is no-way to &quot;import&quot;, unless you write a program for that task.</p><p>By design, by default, openwrt is just a &quot;default&quot; firmware, it just come with basic function by default;&nbsp; no webui, no usb support, no vpn etc......<br />Then you can install whatever you want by opkg.<br />However of coz you have to build every packages first, and you router should have enough space to install those packages.<br />So what is your problem ?</p><p>Sounds like you have to re-select the items you need every time before start build your images.<br />You can keep menuconfig setting, do you know ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>johan666</strong> on 9 Aug 2012, 14:06)</p>

					<p>You might try getting output from &quot;opkg list-installed&quot;, and prune that list, reformat it for .config format and add the reformatted lines from that list to your .config.<br />Then run make menuconfig again just to make sure you have all the dependencies right and to clean out double lines.</p><p>It should actually be a rather straightforward task with opkg, cut (package name before first space) and sed (add =y to the end and CONFIG_PACKAGE_ to the beginning of the line. I am not at my Linux machine now, so no script yet, sorry.</p><p>Then you can use ./scripts/diffconfig.sh to get out a .config with all the non-default items you have in the config. That short list is easy to use as the template. (All default lines are removed, so the output it practically just the effect of the selections you have made and their dependencies.)</p><p>I am using a &quot;recipe&quot; when creating my firmware version regularly. I manually copy a permanent .config.init as the new .config. Then make defconfig blows it up to a full .config.</p><p>Read here:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=147078#p147078">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 78#p147078</a></p><p>Newest .config.init&nbsp; (to be copied to &quot;.config&quot; before running menuconfig)<br /><a href="http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/trunk-r33056-2012-08-08/WNDR3700-trunk-r33056-2012-08-08-1810.config.init">http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/t … onfig.init</a></p><p>Diffconfig output: (it is longer than the recipe, as it contains all dependecies of modules in the .config.init recipe)<br /><a href="http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/trunk-r33056-2012-08-08/WNDR3700-trunk-r33056-2012-08-08-1810.diffconfig">http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/t … diffconfig</a></p><p>Full .config:<br /><a href="http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/trunk-r33056-2012-08-08/WNDR3700-trunk-r33056-2012-08-08-1810.config">http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/t … 810.config</a></p><p>Build scripts:<br /><a href="http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/trunk-r33056-2012-08-08/WNDR3700-trunk-r33056-2012-08-08-1810-buildscripts.txt">http://koti.welho.com/hnyman1/Openwrt/t … cripts.txt</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 9 Aug 2012, 14:07)</p>
