					<p>Well, I know it is difficult to believe but I had OpenWrt on my RPi and accidentally tried to upgrade firmware from web interface and not only that, it was a different platform&#039;s firmware file. ( because I mixed up the routers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> )</p><p>Now the card works fine in windows and linux, but at least one digicam can&#039;t recognize it and RPi can&#039;t boot from it anymore.</p><p>I tried to erase it several ways<br />1- Format with sdformatter v4 full with overwrite<br />2- Delete partitions from windows and re-format<br />3- Write zeros with &#039;dd&#039; command.</p><p>This tells me that somehow OpenWrt wrote to some areas of the card which normal utilities can&#039;t write.</p><p>So the question is how can one reset the card fully to functioning form?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>@mazillo, I am not disputing that I made a mistake. But it was something that OpenWRT did which broke the sdcard. I can abuse an sdcard as much as I want and they never get broken like this. So I was wondering if anybody knows how to restore functionality.</p>									</div>

					<p>@mazilo, first of all, I didnt mean it was openwrt&#039;s fault. But the question was is there a solution? I dont get why you are so aggressive.</p><p>The other thing is that if I upgrade a bios or firmware for another router, they usually check compatibility and if there is a mismatch, they ask &quot;are you sure?&quot; So, dont you think openwrt is lacking this essential feature? It is funny, it is like you wouldnt put an oil warning light to a car then tell customer they should have checked oil levels regularly... Now would you buy cars from that sort of company in future which makes cars missing essential basic features?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>RangerZ, i think that utility just zeros out disk like dd utility in linux. If it doesnt specifically support sdcards, it cant fix it. I already full formatted and zeroed it using several utilities and it doesnt work. But thanks for the suggestion. ( i will try it never the less and let you know if it works )</p>									</div>

However, if you would like to see such an additional feature, please feel free to add it for posterity shake. Until then, please stop accusing OpenWRT to break your SD card mainly because of your carelessness that caused such a problem. Had you been nice not to make such an accusation, I certainly would have offered you some solutions that may and/or may not help.</p>									</div>

					<p>@Mazilo<br />I am sorry but you are wrong.&nbsp; Uploaded the incorrect file. If OpenWRT was writing the file to sdcard normally like a normal image writer, then this shouldnt have happened to it. Do you understand now that OpenWrt broke it?<br />Putting a wrong image to an sdcard should not break the sdcard eh?</p>									</div>

					<p>This may be a completely stupid thought, so take it for what it&#039;s worth:</p><p>The card itself may be getting flaky.&nbsp; It might have little or nothing to do with mis-flashing the RPi or OpenWRT.&nbsp; Not a flash memory expert, but there are different speed classes of SD cards (and grades of memory).&nbsp; Perhaps your SD card works in hardware that only needs slower cards???</p><p>Clemmitt</p>									</div>

					<p>I fear no one can help you, because it theoretikly not possible, and i hear this problem first time.<br />But only for info, can you post what have you exacly done ?<br />And is the RPI dead or the sdcard ?<br />Was the sdcard working well before ?</p><p>The only explanation for the dead of the sdcard is that the RPI starts to write on the bootprocess (because the wrong image),<br />and you stop it with poweroff, so i think the sdcard is dead.</p>									</div>

					<p>Closing this topic as it will not lead anywhere. SD-cards should not break by merely writing to them. OpenWrt uses ordinary &quot;dd&quot; to write its image which is not known to write inaccessible areas.</p>									</div>
