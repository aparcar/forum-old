					<p>Random Info:<br />Console Settings _POST_ Kernel Load: 115,200 8N1<br />Console Settings _PRE_ Kernel Load: ???</p><p>I hate to be the guy that starts another &#039;bricked&#039; thread, but I&#039;ve gone about as far as I can go without someone elses help. I&#039;ll start from the beginning, and will also post up some screenshots in a write-up I&#039;ve been working on.</p><p>Initially I soft-bricked it by botching some switch settings in the web ui. The fix is to crack the device open and plug into the JTAG interface. Unbrick by fixing the config in vim via console. Cool.</p><p>Step 2 was to upgrade the device to latest release (14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-uap-pro-squashfs-factory.bin). I opted for the factory because it&#039;d been quite a while since I updated - I figured that a fresh flash would do the WAP good (and nobody said anywhere that I saw not to use the factory BIN). </p><p>I tried to flashing via TFTP but the connection kept breaking part way through. So then I downloaded the .bin into /tmp, verified the sig (it matched), and then tried sysupgrade -v but it failed due to &quot;platform_check_image_failed&quot;. So following the guide (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade</a>), I used MTD which worked just fine. </p><p>However, I now get a kernel panic when ever I boot, with the following message repeated over and over again. <br /> [&nbsp; &nbsp; 7.030000] jffs2: jffs2_scan_eraseblock(): Magic bitmask 0x1985 not found at 0x00220010: 0x0c7c instead</p><p>Here&#039;s the bull boot log: <a href="http://pastebin.com/ZVJ9ffEZ">http://pastebin.com/ZVJ9ffEZ</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Swix</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 20:30)</p>

					<p>Anyone have any suggestions? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I hate to see this poor thing have to make its way to the recycling center. It&#039;s a solid piece of hardware. Even being able to see the pre-boot console would be helpful, but I need the settings!</p>									</div>
