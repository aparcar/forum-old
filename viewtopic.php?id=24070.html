					<p>I think that someone could make a luci gui for transmission (one to use instead of transmission web-ui) - Actually it seems to have been already made, but it&#039;s not fully compatible (or atleast I wasn&#039;t able to make it work) with openwrt.</p><p>Check this link: <a href="http://trac.fonosfera.org/fon-ng/browser/trunk/luci/applications/luci-torrent/">http://trac.fonosfera.org/fon-ng/browse â€¦ i-torrent/</a></p><p>Someone once asked for ideas for luci, and this is a great idea..</p>									</div>

					<p>hi</p><p>i use transmission 1.92 in backfire<br />and i find one script, but not running<br />returned this error:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@server:/home# ./script
tail: unrecognized option `--lines=+2&#039;
BusyBox v1.15.3 (2010-04-06 03:14:11 CEST) multi-call binary

Usage: tail [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

Print last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.
With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the
file name. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Options:
-c N[kbm] Output the last N bytes
-n N[kbm] Print last N lines instead of last 10
-f Output data as the file grows
-q Never output headers giving file names
-s SEC Wait SEC seconds between reads with -f
-v Always output headers giving file names

If the first character of N (bytes or lines) is a &#039;+&#039;, output begins with
the Nth item from the start of each file, otherwise, print the last N items
in the file. N bytes may be suffixed by k (x1024), b (x512), or m (1024^2).

					<p>@szabi<br />Hi,<br />the tail command in Openwrt can&#039;t handle the option `--lines=+2&#039;<br />If you replace the `--lines=+2&#039; with `-n +2`it should work.<br />At least it did for me under Openwrt.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sam0815</strong> on 9 Apr 2010, 15:58)</p>
