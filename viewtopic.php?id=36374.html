					<p>Hello. Thank you for this forum. I am a semi-retired IT type with a couple of clients needing a paid hotspot portal. My background is as network engineer, instructor, MS Windows. Started off building IBM clones in the 80&#039;s, which evolved to networking, supporting Windows in the business world, and more lately wireless networking. In other words, just goin&#039; with the flow. Wrote a book a few years ago on networking called &quot;Network Routing Basics&quot; (ISBN-10: 0471772739).</p><p>But I&#039;ve never been a developer, and never stepped too far into the Unix world. Truthfully (and with no chest beating), I was simply making too much money supporting the toy called Microsoft Windows, which I&#039;ve best heard described as &quot;a program loader, not an OS&quot;. Unix and its derivatives were another world, and back then all the guys (and it was only guys) were angry, arrogant, anti-social types, so I wasn&#039;t breaking down the doors to break into Unix.</p><p>Now it&#039;s a different world and Linux is cool and ubiquitous. In seeking a solution to the best equipment for wireless networking I stumbled upon Ubiquiti. Built on a linux kernel. Solid. Never looked back. Now in looking for a great hotspot solution, most everything off-the-shelf doesn&#039;t have what I want. So that leads me to 3rd party firmware. Oh.. Linux again.</p><p>So, as I work through a few platforms to come up with the solution my clients are asking for, I tiptoe through the various 3rd party solutions. Gargoyle.... TomatoUSB... and currently chillifire.</p><p>I want to understand chillifire. Lots and lots of choices on the many menus of the GUI. You don&#039;t just pull down a menu and choose between ROUTER or BRIDGE configuration. Far more control than that... and far more ways to get into trouble ;&gt;. But documentation I&#039;ve seen on chillifire is pathetic at best. Floating questions to their tech support is like arm wrestling, or pulling teeth. They hardly have enough time to answer basic questions, let alone suffer someone like me asking things like &quot;how come even though my Picostation 2MHP running your firmware appears to be configured in bridge mode, it&#039;s handing out IP addresses to clients as though it&#039;s in NAT (router) mode?</p><p>So, I finally get to my question for this post. Where do you go for docs on chillifire? How much commonality does chillifire have with other open-wrt builds? Maybe docs on other open-wrt derivatives will do. But I don&#039;t need DEVELOPER docs. That&#039;s over my head (I&#039;m too old now to learn Linux. No etc/ folders for me. My brain is full. Gonna have to fake it at the gui until the clock runs out). I need understanding-how-to-configure-from-the-gui docs.&nbsp; And where do I post my chillifire questions other than chillifire tech support? </p><p>I don&#039;t assume I will find my answers in this forum. But perhaps someone who lurks here could point me. Thank you!<br />jim</p>									</div>
