					<p>Hi again. I&#039;ve gotten openvpn working successfully under both kamikaze and backfire, as both server and client, but I&#039;ve always had to descend into /etc/firewall.user and iptables commands to do so. I&#039;d think this should be possible with uci and /etc/config/firewall, but I&#039;ve never figured out how, and I&#039;m not the only one, so I thought I&#039;d ask here for the right way.</p><p>In /etc/firewall.user, I have this (which works):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT    # allow VPN packets onto LAN
iptables -I FORWARD -o tun+ -j ACCEPT   # allow allow LAN packets onto VPN</code></pre></div><p>In /etc/config/firewall, there was the following prepopulated (and commented out, which I thought was weird):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#config forwarding
#    option src vpn
#    option dest lan
#
#config forwarding
#    option src lan
#    option dest vpn</code></pre></div><p>This looks to me like it is meant to achieve the same thing; I uncommented it, but the firewall blocks packets between LAN and VPN. (If I disable the firewall, packets flow as desired; if I use the iptables rules above, packets flow as desired; if the firewall is enabled without my manual iptables rules, the router returns ICMP &quot;destination port unreachable&quot; responses to the LAN client.)</p><p>Reading the docs for /etc/config/firewall (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</a>), it seems to say that the &quot;config forwarding&quot; sections rely on state match which relies on connection tracking so conntrack has to be on for either the source or destination zone, which by default is not true of either vpn or lan, so I turned on conntrack for the vpn zone; that didn&#039;t help.</p><p>So I fell back to my manual iptables rules, and as I said I&#039;m not the only one -- I found this article, <a href="http://www.tolaris.com/2010/09/01/openwrt-10-03-on-buffalo-wzr-hp-g300nh/">http://www.tolaris.com/2010/09/01/openw … hp-g300nh/</a>, where the author also didn&#039;t find a cleaner way of handling the firewall&lt;&gt;openvpn interaction.</p><p>So my questions:<br />- why doesn&#039;t the obvious &quot;config forwarding&quot; stuff in /etc/config/firewall work?<br />- why is that stuff commented out by default?<br />- is the conntrack for vpn zone actually necessary, as the docs seem to imply, and if so, should that be added by default?<br />- does anyone know how to get vpn&lt;&gt;lan traffic forwarding to work via /etc/config/firewall?<br />- barring that, are the iptables commands I&#039;m using in /etc/firewall.user an acceptable substitute?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>BTW, I can&#039;t remember now if the vpn zone, and the related forwarding rules, in /etc/config/firewall were put there by the system by default, or by me messing around with luci, or by me manually; there&#039;s a good chance I put them there weeks ago and forgot about it, in which case please ignore all the stuff I said about that stuff being there by default.</p><p>If it&#039;s entirely wrong, my bad, but I&#039;d still appreciate hearing from anyone who can tell me how to do it right.</p><p>Here&#039;s my entire /etc/config/firewall:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;defaults&#039;

But it defaults to zone.name, so shouldn&#039;t be necessary in that case.<br />- forwarding.forward: don&#039;t see that in the docs. You have it for the lan-&gt;vpn direction but not the vpn-&gt;lan direction. What does it mean to have a &quot;forwarding&quot; section without the &quot;forward&quot; option?</p><p>Basically the difference between what you have and what I tried is</p><p>1) the zone.network option for the vpn zone, setting the interface name the same as the zone name (but that should already be the default)<br />2) zone.forward set to accept for vpn zone<br />3) forwarding.forward set to accept for the forwarding section with src lan, dest vpn</p><p>I guess I&#039;m unclear on the specifics of these forwarding options -- I&#039;d think that a pair of forwarding sections (for src lan dest vpn, and src vpn dest lan) should obviate the need for #2, and I don&#039;t know what #3 does.</p><p>So I&#039;ll assume this is right and try playing with it, but I&#039;d appreciate knowing *why* it&#039;s right.</p>									</div>
