					<p>Good afternoon arokh,</p><p>Let me first start by thanking you for the awesome job you have done in making the wnrd3700 an incredible device.</p><p>I am currently running on your OpenWrt | Kamikaze (r24535) build that i got from the dropbox link you put at dd-wrt forum.</p><p>I do have to point a couple of issues, sorry...</p><p>1 - I am unable to use wireless lan on the Band N for intel AGN cards (it sux bc at home I have 2 laptops with that that are unable to connect and 2 macs that work perfectly!). Do you know when that is fixed, if its in your control of course... I know is a known issue (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7697">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7697</a>)<br />2 - I am not able to get the &quot;Essentials&quot; button on the Luci interface. Is this intended? Is there anyway to get it back? (see screens below)<br />3 - QoS doesnt work, if you try to install the package, or edit the config at /etc/config/qos and try to start the service it will say its not compatible and fail to start... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i51.tinypic.com/smrsqt.png" alt="http://i51.tinypic.com/smrsqt.png" /></span></p><p>root@OpenWrt /root# /etc/init.d/qos restart<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />Dump terminated<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />Dump terminated<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />We have an error talking to the kernel<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />We have an error talking to the kernel<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />We have an error talking to the kernel<br />RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported<br />We have an error talking to the kernel<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />Cannot find device &quot;imq0&quot;<br />root@OpenWrt /root# </p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/1075632084.png" alt="http://www.speedtest.net/result/1075632084.png" /></span></p><p>I would like to make a bridged network, put my sister on it and limit the speed to something that allows the rest of the users to work, since it seems she doesnt understand that unlimited upload in torrents makes the rest of the internet usage unusable.</p><p>I remember that in DDWRT you could do bandwidth control on ips, can you do that on Openwrt, that might work out too...</p><br /><p>4 - Sometimes Radios are not broadcasting (sometimes I am missing the 5G link)</p><p>Like for example now <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>5 - Mount point screen fails to automount stuff after reboot... (am i missing something? see screen below)</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i53.tinypic.com/xkvf4o.png" alt="http://i53.tinypic.com/xkvf4o.png" /></span></p><p>I saw you basically installed the whole list of packages, lawl, so overlay runs out of space veeery soon. </p><p>Following this guide (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/howto/configure-external-storage-overlay?s%5B%5D=table&amp;s%5B%5D=hardware">http://wiki.openwrt.org/inbox/howto/con … D=hardware</a>) I changed the storage size from 900k? to 750MB X).</p><p>I think that if possible it should be added by default so all users can get the extra space.</p><p>I have a couple of questions, first one is, how do i update my current build to your latest one without loosing any of my settings? (including overlay space) and second, is there any way to change the power of the antennas? I remember that when I was using DD-WRT it was reporting 26 db on band 2.4G and 23db on band 5G and OpenWRT reports 20db on band 2.4G and 17db in the band 5G, I tried changing the Regulatory Domain but without success... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>Thank you!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abolition</strong> on 18 Dec 2010, 14:38)</p>

					<p>Ok, so I reinstalled the new image (one before extroot build) and the wifi signal issue seems fixed! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> at least on wifi n I am getting 40mbps now on the intel AGN vs the none that I was getting pre update... So thats a thumbs up <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" /></p><p>I am still struggling to get the qos shit rolling <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> i tried to use the nodogsplash but without success as it can only manage the br-lan interface <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />... That one I will keep researching, but in the mean time, I saw your fw comes with pptpd installed, I do not know how to make it work, I tried creating the account like you say in the first page and restarted the service but im not sure i can connect, I also made the rule in the firewall to route all traffic on port 1723 to the ip 192.168.0.2 (my router) but still nothing.</p><p>I tried installing a pptp vpn on my mac mini (ivpn) and that worked out of the box (After opening port 1723), Am i missing something? I would very much prefer using the router as my vpn server.</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>It works, all you need to do is add the user as described and open port 1723. To troubleshoot look at the log. If you don&#039;t see anything in the logs, traffic is not reaching your router, maybe because of a firewall or maybe your client isn&#039;t set up properly.</p><p>root@OpenWrt /root# cat /etc/ppp/chap-secrets <br />#USERNAME&nbsp; PROVIDER&nbsp; PASSWORD&nbsp; IPADDRESS<br />myuser * mypassword *</p><p>Like that.
