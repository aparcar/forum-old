					<p>Hi!&nbsp; I have the WRT1900ACS</p><p>I am not satisfied with the software. I have mac filters for WiFi and would open up a guest network here in Christmas to all who come to visit. It turned out that the mac-filter also affects the guest network. I contacted Linksys and found it to be a bug, but it vil they did not confess, but think it should be so.</p><p>How is it with OpenWRT, how is it handled there?<br />A good thing with WRT1900 is that you can reserve the address DHCP. OpenWRT also has the function?</p><p>I want to change software but I do not know what to change to.</p><p>Best regards<br />C.wiklund</p>									</div>
