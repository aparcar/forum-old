					<p>I&#039;ve got an Asus WL-500GD that I&#039;ve been running for a while now, but one of the things that I&#039;d originally wanted to do was add a second radio to it... recently I heard that Kamikaze had (among all the other vast improvements over my old WR4) support for RT2500/2570 USB wifi adapters. Grabbed myself an Asus WL-167G, which I understand is supposed to based on this chipset, and after several other annoying problems with Kamikaze finally got things all set, up and running with the appropriate modules, but the driver doesn&#039;t seem to pickup the USB adapter. Dmesg tells me that it sees a new device connected, but it simply reports:<br />usb.c: USB device 4 (vend/prod 0xb05/0x1723) is not claimed by any active driver.</p><p>and does little else. I&#039;m kind of at a loss.. shouldn&#039;t this work? The only other thing I can think is that for some reason it&#039;s based on a different chip or isn&#039;t being identified properly, but that seems unusual. Also, I noticed that ralink has Linux drivers directly, so why is the Makefile pointing at a sourceforge loation?...</p><p>Any thoughts/ideas?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>Did you have to do lots of work in order to just get the device detected, or to make it actually work the way you wanted it to? I&#039;m stuck with 2.4 due to the broadcom wifi issue, but I&#039;d certainly appreciate any information you&#039;ve got about those &quot;manual steps&quot; you had to take.</p>									</div>
