					<p>Has anyone else had issues getting the latest trunk revision to compile? I pulled down a clean Git yesterday, then used menuconfig to set the Developer Options / Broken Platforms toggle to allow for the WNDR3700v4 target, made the tweak per Hnyman&#039;s post, and then compiled.

					<p>Hello</p><p>I know I&#039;m no developer (well, acutally I am, just not on embedded devices, ha!), but I&#039;m having trouble with my WNDR3700v4 on dd-wrt, it&#039;s PPPoE connection is unstable (very much so, loses connection 3, 4, 5 times an hour), and the wireless clients disconnect at the same time too.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;ll be wanting to try out this build soon so I&#039;ve downloaded </p><p>openwrt-ar71xx-nand-wndr3700v4-ubi-factory.img</p><p>From </p><p><a href="http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/OpenWRT/Barrier-Breaker-r40560/">http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/ … er-r40560/</a></p><p>In anticipation.</p><p>This is a factory.img so I should be able to directly flash this via tftp, yes? Planning on erasing dd-wrt and entering tftp mode by following:</p><p>mtd -r erase nvram ## This is what I did, it automatically reboots.</p><p>Once you get a ping back, do this to erase dd-wrt:</p><p>telnet 192.168.1.1<br />root/admin<br />mtd erase linux &lt;&lt; not mtb</p><p>This forces you into reset mode, with a green blinking power light.<br />No more poking the button when I&#039;m hours away from an MRI on my wrist </p><p>And I should be able to tftp put the openwrt firmware factory.img at this point?</p><p>As I&#039;m totally new to openwrt, can someone tell me if the web config pages are installed in this image file please? Not desperately keen on having to cli my router but I guess if needs must. Stability and functionality are more important than visual niceness, but I&#039;d like the web UI <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>Sorry for hijacking the dev forum with newbie questions. I only bought the darned router because dd-wrt said it was supported (and then, turns out, not so well supported), and I can&#039;t return it, so really hoping I can get openwrt going on it.</p><p>thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>finally got around to updating to 40512. everythings running fine right now. still had the loss of ipv6 address, and still dunno what caused that. but right now it is working. 40387 ran so stable for weeks. only thing that got the router to reboot was a power failure from a storm, which set off the ipv6 loss again. lets see how long this stays up for.</p>									</div>

					<p>AdamK, <br />I have installed your current last build and It&#039;s not possible to install any kernel module because it points to the daily build so kernel version mismatches. I have wndr3700v4 and I need it to work. I couldn&#039;t find any roadmap with the estimated date of a new stable release of openwrt. Do I have to compile my own version of the image and modules and put the modules on a web server to access from my router? If after that I need to update openwrt version, can I generate a sysupgrade image? I have only seen factory images on your repository.</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi there,<br />That is correct.&nbsp; Sadly there are no images built automatically by the OpenWRT developers as it is still classified as a broken platform.&nbsp; The reason for this is because they are still grappling with the NAND flash in these devices.&nbsp; It is for this same reason that there are no sysupgrade images available; the ability to sysupgrade is broken in trunk.&nbsp; This has been the case now for quite sometime so my intention with my builds is to provide as many features as possible OOB so that members don&#039;t have a need to go tinkering about with trying to install modules and at least providing them also with an OpenWRT image to see how it will work on their devices.</p><p>It is pleasing to see that quite a few people have been able to use these image builds and are reporting that things are working really well for them.&nbsp; </p><p>Your post has given me an idea as to how I may address your issue however.&nbsp; There is an option which says &quot;Select all packages by default&quot; which I have enabled.&nbsp; Hopefully that will build all packages thus empowering you to download them from my repository &amp; add/remove packages.&nbsp; However for now at least that ability would need to be done manually via the CLI, until I can spare the time to modify source code and enable it to be done via LuCI.</p><p>I&#039;m in the throws of testing an image build based on trunk revision 40718 at present, as an earlier attempt at a fresh build failed rather miserably and put my router into an infinite rebooting loop.&nbsp; This was identified as being caused by some upgrades done to GCC/Linaro which broke the image produced even after a make clean.&nbsp; So I did a full wipe of my trunk source tree and did a full fresh checkout and built the whole lot from scratch.&nbsp; This seems to have worked, so now I am looking at ways on how to address your problem and also another issue mentioned in another thread.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>AdamK</strong> on 8 May 2014, 01:25)</p>

					<p>small question. no big deal. but why are dhcpv6 leases always marked as expired? when you are leased one, it gives a 1 hour countdown before then. and none of my devices have lost their ipv6 address and ipv6 still works just fine. but the router still says expired forever. i do also wonder why hostnames also show a &quot;?&quot; for some devices, when dhcpv4 lists everything fine. it all works, its just weird.</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IiiYIl6.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/IiiYIl6.png" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>Just wanted to say thanks for making those WNDRv4 images.&nbsp; I installed <a href="http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/OpenWRT/Barrier-Breaker-r40859/openwrt-ar71xx-nand-wndr3700v4-ubi-factory.img">http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/ … actory.img</a> today on my WNDR3700v4 and it worked a treat.&nbsp; The only thing that took a bit of fiddling was getting the VLANs right, but that was the case on my old WNDR3700 v1 on 12.09 as well.&nbsp; (VLAN changes seem to require manually editing the config file to get it just right, and rebooting to reprogram the switch.)</p><p>I also noticed that every time it reboots it randomly picks a new MAC address on the uplink port.&nbsp; That&#039;s nice for interfacing to a public network, but very annoying when you want to use DHCP reservations.&nbsp; I ended up just using a static address.</p><p>Anyway, thanks again.&nbsp; Love being able to have both my WNDR3700s on OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>How stable are these builds? I&#039;d really love to ditch the default firmware for an openwrt build if I thought it was stable enough. It&#039;s just for a home setup so nothing mission critical.</p>									</div>
