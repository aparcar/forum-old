					<p>I need to access a Server behind the OpenWRT from Clients connected to OpenVPN-Server.<br />I need full access to all services an ports.

					<p>Hi Nicki,</p><p>Are your openvpn clients connecting ? I ask because in the configuration you posted I don&#039;t see port 1194 UDP being forwarded to the OpenVPN server. Not sure if you left it out in your example.</p>									</div>

					<p>I have updated the diagram. Now it is correct. The OpenWRT-Router and Clients are connected to OpenVPN-Server. This Server is behind a FritzBox 7490 with 1194 UDP forwarded. Clients are connected to OpenVPN-Server. On Server behind the OpenWRT-Router run a Service on Port 4500. This Service is not avaible for the Clients. This is the Service that I need.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nicki</strong> on 23 May 2016, 11:44)</p>

					<p>You cannot do masquerade if you are using TAP, so this </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>option masq &#039;1&#039;
option mtu_fix &#039;1&#039;</code></pre></div><p> should be removed from VPN_FW firewall zone.<br />You didn&#039;t paste server config, but you should use client-to-client option (not sure is this necessery in tap config).</p>									</div>

					<p>Ah, I overlooked it. You try to connect with TAP to LAN behind a client - that won&#039;t work! You have to use TUN and don&#039;t forget to apply forwarding between vpn and lan zone at your client openwrt router. Use masquerade at server vpn zone and push route of LAN that is behind openwrt client.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>khain</strong> on 23 May 2016, 16:23)</p>

					<p>No, multicast traffic is only possible on tap. Two ways to solve this. Configure client directly on server 10.80.1.19 or set up openvpn server on OpenWRT router.</p>									</div>
