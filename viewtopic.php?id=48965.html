					<p>Just checked on my new AMD T40E board from PCEngines: No, only one CPU supported. Also no HIMEM support, only 800MB RAM are supported. :-(</p><p>Strange kernel config for a x86 target. Most x86 processors today are multi-core. And more than 800MB is also pretty normal these days.</p><p>So, I guess I will need to look into kernel compilation myself...</p><p>Is there any known way to only make the kernel and all the modules as ipk packages?</p>									</div>
