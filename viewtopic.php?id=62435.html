					<p>I am trying to flash the OpenWRT image found <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/kirkwood/generic/">here (openwrt-kirkwood-linksys-viper-squashfs-factory.bin)</a> through the OEM firmware; however, the progress bar gets to 50% and the router self reboots. When it comes back up, it&#039;s running the OEM firmware freshly reset. What is going on? I am running OEM firmware 2.1.41.164606.</p><p>I have done numerous hard resets (30/30/30), but it always ends up back at the OEM firmware.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>heartsofwar</strong> on 28 Jan 2016, 20:33)</p>
