					<p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I just got myself an Archer C5 and flashed openwrt on it. <br />However, im totally new to openWRT and noticed it doesnt come with any media sharing by default. <br />I want to play media from my external HDD (NTFS) and used to do it with smb on my previous router. <br />I saw that i need miniDLNA server on this one for media sharing so i installed the package however thats it. <br />I dont know how to configure or how to boot it, dunno if i need to mount the HDD either. <br />Can anyone guide me trough this? </p><p>Thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>start here: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/minidlna</a><br />There is also a luci-app for minidlna that will let you configure it from the webgui. You&#039;ll also need USB &amp; NTFS support and then mount your external HDDs to make them accessible via DLNA. More info in the wiki on those topics also.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>drawz</strong> on 1 Dec 2014, 23:11)</p>
