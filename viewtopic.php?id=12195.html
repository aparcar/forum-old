					<p>i know how to telnet into the router, thats not that hard. im really unexperienced with the linux command line though.<br />what im trying to do is the tftp method by entering in<br />tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT firmware.bin<br />okay that would work if i knew where the firmware was supposed to be so that this would work. is there anywhere specific in my windows filesystem that its supposed to go??? right now its just sitting on my c:\ root directory, does it need to be in c:\documents and settings\username?</p>									</div>

					<p>It doesn&#039;t have to be in any particular directory.&nbsp; Just cd to the directory where the code.bin exists and issue the TFTP command from there.&nbsp; Make sure you have the ping running in one window as outlined in the instructions, power cycle the router and hit enter on the window with the TFTP command as soon as you get a response to the ping.&nbsp; You only have a second or two to start the TFTP command and you might have to try several times before being successful.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>regloss</strong> on 22 Aug 2007, 05:21)</p>

					<p>OK, I&#039;m not sure how detiled I should be so just incase I&#039;m being pretty detailed here.</p><p>Go to the linksys.com and download the latest factory firmware for your unit.</p><p>If you have any sort of firewall software on your PC, the ping or the tftp command may not work.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to temporarily turn of firewall and internet security software before doing this.</p><p>Telnet or SSH in to the router and type:<br />&quot;nvram set boot_wait=on&quot;</p><p>and then type:<br />&quot;nvram commit&quot;</p><p>Then you shouldn&#039;t ever have to log in to the router anymore. The rest of this procedure is done on your PC.</p><p>Change the IP address on your PC to a Staic ip of 192.168.1.10 with a gateway of 192.168.1.1</p><p>Then open two command prompt windows.&nbsp; In one window type &quot;ping -w 5 -t 192.168.1.1&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;You should see continuous replies.</p><p>Then in the second command prompt window:<br />If you saved the new linksys firmware on your desktop then you would do a &quot;cd desktop&quot; before running this command:<br />&quot;tftp -i 192.168.1.1 PUT linksysfilename.bin&quot; (linksysfilename.bin actually being whatever file that you just downloaded from linksys.com) but dont press enter yet.<br />Unplug the router and plug it back in.&nbsp; You should see the replies stop from the ping window.<br />The split second that you start seeing replies again you hit the enter key on the tftp command to launch it.</p><p>If it worked, you should see a Transfer successful messege.<br />If you dont get a sucessful messege, then reboot the router again and try hitting the tftp command right when the pings start replying.&nbsp; It ussually works on the first or second try for me.</p>									</div>
