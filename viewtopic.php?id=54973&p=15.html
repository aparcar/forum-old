					<p>Really like the C2600 and it is even better with OpenWrt, but what bothers me that I can not get HT40 to function on 2.4 GHz network. It seems that it is set, but any device connected to it will just function on 20Mhz channels and thus yield slower speeds.</p><p>Does anyone else have similiar problems, and if not how did you set it?
