					<p>I have managed to mod my router to support usb devices that required high power from usb host&nbsp; ... like 2,5&#039;&#039; harddrive&#039;s (via usb-to-ide adapters) ,and others</p><p>if u take look on bottom of wgt board u will find a small AIC 1526-1 8-pin chip . It &#039;s &quot;Dual USB High-Side Power Switch&quot; . Chip is very small only 4x5 mm !&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; _______<br />&nbsp; -|1&nbsp; &nbsp;U&nbsp; &nbsp;5|-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the pin 4 is solder to GND ,and Pin 8 is not connected<br />&nbsp; -|2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6|-<br />&nbsp; -|3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7|-<br />&nbsp; -L4____ 8|-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />To get it done u must remove connection between pin 4 and the pad ... i use small sharp knife to cut it off from the pad . Dont mind the pad ... mind the pin !! Do the same with pin no 8 .Now take thin wire and connect pin 4 to pin 1 ,and pin 8 to the pin 5.<br />Also there is small black rectangular diode between chip and the netgear usb port .Connect their ends with thin wire .This will remove small voltage drop out from diode .Now u can use your 2,5 &#039;&#039; usb-to-ide adapter without external power source and even hide it inside the device !! The port should draw 1A current ...i think It&#039;s enough to power any decent usb device :] .The usb voltage is +5V under load without diode voltage drop out<br />picture:<br /><a href="http://nicefile.w.interia.pl/usb_mod.jpg">netgear wgt634u usb power mod</a><br />kind regards</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nicefile</strong> on 12 Feb 2012, 00:00)</p>

					<p>cool!<br />I try your modification and find it quite useful, I used to plug an extra power supply for my 2.5 disk in wgt634u now the disk could run with only one USB cable!</p>									</div>

					<p>I like it. Thanks for sharing. One question is the USB port may be able to deliver 1A of power; however, since the AC/DC power adapter can only deliver 1A, I believe you need to make additional statement to replace the original AC/DC power adapter with a bigger rating. Otherwise, this will cause some problems.</p>									</div>

					<p>the USB port should draw 1A (its spin up mine 0.7A rated ATA-HDD + caddy)&nbsp; even if whole router is powered by 12v/1.2A power adapter.<br />Tip: newer drives usually uses less power<br />On J8 header there is USB but client mode from broadcom processor. Only usb 2.0 host port is provided by PD720101 chip.You could add external powered usb2 hub but it seems to be unstable on zd1211b + hdd + spca5xx .And again usb2.0 speed of this one is below expected ... i think to buy and mod cheap se505v2 or wl500gp</p>									</div>

					<p>Guys,</p><p>Can anyone confirm whether this mod works fine? I&#039;m just about to get it done on my wgt634u as I am tired of weak power supply out of the USB port and I don&#039;t really want to buy powered USB hub.</p><p>What I find strange is that according to the description pin 4 (CTLA) is cut off from GND and then soldered to pin 1 (CTLB). However when you look at the picture pin 4 is not soldered directly to pin 1 but before it!? To me it would really make sense to connect CTLA with CTLB and OUTA and OUTB. Any ideas?</p><p>Anyway datasheet for AIC1526 can be found:<br /><a href="http://www.huandong.com.cn/pdf/200612/AIC1526.PDF">http://www.huandong.com.cn/pdf/200612/AIC1526.PDF</a></p><p>Thanks,<br />Stan</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>baracudaz</strong> on 13 Oct 2009, 00:34)</p>
