					<p>Hi there!</p><p>I have a big problem bothering me... the usb 1.1 support on ASUS WL-500G Premium</p><p>The router has the VIA VT82xx USB 2.0 controller on board and the EHCI (usb 2.0) stuff is working good. The problem is I need to attach a USB 1.1 device to the usb 2.0 controller and so I have to use the UHCI driver, which won&#039;t initialise the via chip!!</p><p>The same behaviour is reported here <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5840">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=5840</a> but all the discussion stopped at that point.</p><p>BUT the same build is WORKING on a WGT634U with a NEC USB (but there the OHCI version is used)</p><p>As far as I understood, it seems there are no PCI I/O regions available to initialise the UHCI controller... Are there any fixes for this? Any hints? Links? Whatever... I&#039;m rather desperate with this.</p><p>As the Broadcom CPU used in the wl-500gP has an onboard USB 1.1 I&#039;m wondering if this usb pins are even pulled out from the bga cpu? Is there a &quot;hidden&quot; usb 1.1 port on the board somewhere? </p><p>I have to attach a USB ISDN modem on the router (isdn dial-up for backup) and a usb disk for storage. The WGT + usb hub could be the solution but when the modem is attached via the usb-hub the isdn (hfc_usb) driver says (something like) &quot;all host controller bandwidth is consumed&quot; and won&#039;t transfer any &quot;user&quot; data to the modem (modem connects but no data goes through).</p><br /><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />Regards,<br />M.Culibrk</p><br /><p>Here are some dumps:</p><p>Linux OpenWrt 2.6.17 #1 Fri Sep 1 15:16:37 CEST 2006 mips unknown</p><br /><p>when uhci-hcd loads it says:</p><p>&lt;4&gt;PCI: Fixing up device 0000:01:03.0<br />&lt;7&gt;uhci_hcd 0000:01:03.0: no i/o regions available<br />&lt;3&gt;uhci_hcd 0000:01:03.0: init 0000:01:03.0 fail, -16<br />&lt;4&gt;uhci_hcd: probe of 0000:01:03.0 failed with error -16<br />&lt;4&gt;PCI: Fixing up device 0000:01:03.1<br />&lt;7&gt;uhci_hcd 0000:01:03.1: no i/o regions available<br />&lt;3&gt;uhci_hcd 0000:01:03.1: init 0000:01:03.1 fail, -16<br />&lt;4&gt;uhci_hcd: probe of 0000:01:03.1 failed with error -16</p><br /><br /><p>As mentioned, the problem seems to be the &quot;unavailable I/O&quot; for the uhci chip.

					<p>After some additional researching ( empiric one <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ) I noticed something (very) strange.</p><p>At this moment I think the problem of the UHCI driver and its init errors are due to &quot;no I/O ports available&quot; error. The UHCI driver is the only one which is using I/O ports to control the hardware, all other drivers are using MMIO (memory mapped IO).</p><p>As I said, the lspci says &quot;I/O port ignored&quot;, the uhci-hcd is unable to find a &quot;valid&quot; region for its IO ports and the init fails.</p><p>Given the information that UHCI+EHCI is working good on the W.Russian (RC5) I noticed that the IO reservations are tottaly different on the WR and Kamikaze images:</p><p>On the W.Russian the /proc/ioports says:<br />0100-011f : usb-uhci<br />0120-013f : usb-uhci</p><p>while the Kamikaze has /proc/ioports like this:<br />0000-00ff : SB PCI I/O resources<br />0100-01ff : Ext PCI I/O resources</p><p>To me, this looks like something reserved the &quot;entire&quot; I/O space of interest and no other driver could allocate anything in that range, so the uhci-hcd initialization fails...</p><p>I found this range is &quot;reserved&quot; for the patches for the BroadCom SOC (bcm947xx-patch).<br />I&#039;ll try to put this out to see what will happen.</p><br /><p>Regards,<br />M.Culibrk</p>									</div>

					<p>I &quot;fixed&quot; this IO reservation but this did not help. <br />The UHCI-HCD still fails at init, no i/o regions available....<br />I&#039;ll try to get the list of &quot;supported&quot; resources from at the initialization to compare with the same data from kernel 2.4 and the lspci metadata dump...</p><p>Is it possible that 2.4 and 2.6 kernels differently &quot;program&quot;/&quot;set&quot; pci devices or controller(s) on detection/initialization? (Florian?)</p><p>I suppose the PCI &quot;metadata&quot; (device parameters) remains the same, as this should came from the device itself, right?</p><p>Thanks,<br />M.Culibrk</p>									</div>

					<p>I found a quick &quot;work arround&quot; for this UHCI problem and now I have my 500g P working with usb 1.1 devices ! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> (finally!)</p><p>The &quot;problem&quot; was in the resource allocation/reservation provided in 001-brcm947xx.patch where Ext PCI has the reservation of 0x100-0x1FF (which is really not THE problem).</p><p>The UHCI device itself &quot;offers&quot; 0xfce0 as the I/O range (during first pci initialization, read pci registers).</p><p>The pci code (pci init) found in arch/mips change this resource to 0x400-0x41f in the pci dev structures.</p><p>I checked in the platform specific pci code (in arch/mips/bcm947xx/pci.c) and found the code which effectively fixes the &quot;external PCI&quot; device resources on the brcm boards such that the devices get I/O ranges from 0x100 onwards. That&#039;s all cool but...</p><p>when something (uhci-hcd) tries to initialize/activate the device the pci subsystem tries to reserve and activate the uhci resources which are &quot;currently&quot; set outside the allowed &quot;Ext PCI I/O resources&quot; so the brcm-pci-fix never gets called and the uhci-init fails as &quot;no io resource available&quot;.</p><p>The &quot;dirty&quot; trick I did is to set the &quot;Ext PCI I/O resources&quot; in arch/mips/bcm947xx/pci.c to be from 0x100 to 0x7FF. In this way the before mentioned resource reservation succedes and the brcm-pci-fix gets called and the uhci resources are set to (the expected) 0x100 range.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure is this &quot;trick&quot; will break anything else on other hardware as I currently tested this only on the Asus WL-500G Premium box.</p><p>My question is what would be the best method to fix this? By adding some &quot;pci-quirks&quot; which will fix the addressing before or some other way? Make this only apply for Asus (or other) platforms using the VIA6212 USB? <br />Any (gurus) hint would be appreciated.</p><p>The same goes to the VIA6212 fixes by nbd 218-more-usb.patch which change some registers in the VIA USB controller. Does anybody know if this is really neccessary or what exactly those bits change? That changes are present in the Asus released gpl tarbal but without any explanations...</p><p>Here is the little &quot;fix&quot;...</p><p>diff -Nur linux-2.6.17/arch/mips/bcm947xx/pci.c linux-2.6.17/arch/mips/bcm947xx/pci-fixed.c<br />--- linux-2.6.16/arch/mips/bcm947xx/pci.c 2006-09-20 15:08:32.000000000 +0200<br />+++ linux-2.6.16/arch/mips/bcm947xx/pci-fixed.c 2006-09-20 17:55:51.000000000 +0200<br />@@ -82,8 +82,8 @@</p><p> static struct resource ext_pci_io_resource = {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .name&nbsp; &nbsp;= &quot;Ext PCI I/O resources&quot;,<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.start&nbsp; = 0x100,<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.end&nbsp; &nbsp; = 0x1FF,<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.start&nbsp; = 0x100,<br />+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.end&nbsp; &nbsp; = 0x7FF,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .flags&nbsp; = IORESOURCE_IO,<br /> };</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi mangoo,</p><p>i posted a topic about my problems with the pwc modul. In my case - netgear wgt634u, trunk 4832, kernel 2.6.17 - the pwc modul will not be compiled, even if i included it in the .config as modul or direct in the kernel. when i use make V=99 there are no hints for the complication of the pwc-modul.<br />I have tried so much. Can u post your .config?</p><p>I need to run the webcam with my netgear wgt634u for my master thesis. </p><p>Thx. 4 any help.</p><p>Martin</p>									</div>

					<p>I didnt know that ;-)</p><p>i am just rebuilding it.<br />does anybody know how to clear the kernel-build and rebuild the kernel, without downloading the new kernel-image.<br />at the moment i doing it with:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * make target/clean<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * make target/install<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o rebuilds install image (and kernel too?)</p><p>but this will clear the openwrt/build_mipsel/linux directory. <br />Its important because i downloaded the most recent pwc-module from saillard.org/pwc and want to unpack it into the kernel-tree (under ./build_mipsel/linux/drivers/media/video/pwc/ )</p><p>and does anybody know where to find infos about howto cross-compile sources e.g. the pwc module with the openwrt-toolchain.</p><p>really thx a lot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ares321</strong> on 25 Sep 2006, 15:13)</p>
