					<p>Hey guys,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to setup openwrt on a raspberry. Unfortunately when I plug in the sd card, HDMI cable and power adapter the rasp boot, but soon after the monitor complains no input is coming, and the router doesnt register any request for IPs (it&#039;s connected via lan).</p><p>Im installing latest openwrt image ( <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/brcm2708/generic/openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-ext4_192.img">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … t4_192.img</a> ), using imagewriter on ubuntu.</p><p>Raspbian seems to be working fine.</p><p>Where can i find some log to help you guys?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think you should connect to the GPIO using a TTL device for you to interface with Openwrt in raspberry pi. I have tried using the GPIO with raspbian and other OS for the pi and it works beautifully. In my experience, for you to be able to configure the Openwrt system, you should connect a USB-to-serial adapter to it. That is how most of the stuff here are being done.</p><p>With regards to the PI not requesting an ip, that might be because of the default setting in the network which you should configure further.</p><p>I haven&#039;t tried Openwrt with my pi yet so these are just my assumptions.</p>									</div>
