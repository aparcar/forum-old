					<p>Researching packages for a custom build, I was struck by the assertion on the maradns homepage that it is immune to cache poisoning attacks.&nbsp; Intrigued, I decided to try replacing dnsmasq with maradns as the default recursive dns server.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t use dhcp.)</p><p>Custom build succeeds and is installed.&nbsp; To my surprise the dnsmasq and dhcp options still exist in LUCI menus and throw errors when selected.&nbsp; This is not a huge problem, because maradns can be configured manually and I can just avoid selecting those menu options.</p><p>However, just wondering if its possible to change those menu options through config files or similar?</p><br /><br /><p>BTW, kudos to the developers.&nbsp; Backfire continues to impress.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>str1chn1n3</strong> on 3 Sep 2010, 08:23)</p>
