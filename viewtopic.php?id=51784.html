					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve been making some images by building first an Image Builder using menuconfig. My understanding of this was that the packages selected with &quot;y&quot; and marked with an &quot;*&quot; in menuconfig were directly included in the image, and that packages selected and marked with an &quot;m&quot; had to be specially selected using &quot;make image PROFILE=&quot;&quot; PACKAGES=&quot;example&quot; &quot;</p><p>But I&#039;ve noticed that I had selected some packages (*) that were not included in the image, for example luci. I had to explicetely include them in the &quot;make image&quot; command. </p><p>I&#039;d like to understand when the packages are included in the Image Builder image, and when they have to be included. Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
