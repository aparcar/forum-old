					<p>Hi there!</p><p>So I recently just installed OpenWRT on my WNDR3700 and so far I am extremely thrilled. Now my goal is to have snort running on the WNDR3700, and have it log alerts to my Synology NAS syslog server. I have spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out how to do this, but most related documentation I find are 5-6 years old and seem to contradict each other. </p><p>Could someone point me in the right direction?</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry is the problem getting snort to run or getting it to log to your server? If the latter then the system/logging page of the GUI is where you set it.

Ive already got snort installed, but I just want the alerts to be logged to my server. </p><p>Editing /etc/config/system is all thats required? I reckon I need to config Snort to send the logs somewhere too though, right?</p>									</div>

					<p>I don&#039;t know snort, but have heard of it, so assuming it *can* write to a syslog then yes you will have to tell it where. To see OpenWRT logging then you need the system entries above and a restart.</p><p>My setup FYI is Zyxel modem in bridge mode &lt;&gt; Asus RT-N16 running OpenWRT &amp; PPPoE &lt;&gt; LAN.</p><p>One of the LAN boxes is my syslog server and I just got the Zyxel logging to it this morning. The Asus has since day 1.</p><p>HTH</p>									</div>
