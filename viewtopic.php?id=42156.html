					<p>Hello, I have two gateways (one is backup adsl and the other is wifi ISP, which is faster).

					<p>Sounds like you need more than DHCP to do this. DHCP can be used to indicate that a given connected device should route its packets to a specific interface on the router, but then the router decides which gateway to send those packets to. You would need to &quot;tell&quot; the OpenWRT box to route the packets received on interface1 to gateway1 and those received on interface2 to gateway2, as well as telling the attached device to route its traffic to interface2 instead of interface1. You&#039;d likely also need another NAT to handle the gateway2 traffic as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for reply, I&#039;m using openwrt as a bridge with wifi AP and it is running a dhcp daemon, so it is only assigning addresses, but it is not a gateway at all, so most of the traffic is not going over this openwrt router. One my gateway is mikrotik router, which I don&#039;t have root access to, because it is leased from isp with the service, and the other gateway is adsl modem, both gateways are connected to a switch, where is also my openwrt connected, but it is located elswehere in different building, where I need wifi.</p><p>If I set IP/mask/gatway manually on device, everything is working fine, but some devices I have in network do not support manual IP addressing, they work only with dhcp.</p>									</div>

By default, dnsmasq sends some standard options to DHCP clients, the netmask and broadcast address are set to the same as the host running dnsmasq, and the DNS server and default route are set to the address of the machine running dnsmasq. (Equivalent rules apply for IPv6.) If the domain name option has been set, that is sent. This configuration allows these defaults to be overridden, or other options specified. The option, to be sent may be given as a decimal number or as &quot;option:&lt;option-name&gt;&quot; The option numbers are specified in RFC2132 and subsequent RFCs. The set of option-names known by dnsmasq can be discovered by running &quot;dnsmasq --help dhcp&quot;. For example, to set the default route option to 192.168.4.4, do --dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.4 or --dhcp-option = option:router, 192.168.4.4 and to set the time-server address to 192.168.0.4, do --dhcp-option = 42,192.168.0.4 or --dhcp-option = option:ntp-server, 192.168.0.4 The special address 0.0.0.0 (or [::] for DHCPv6) is taken to mean &quot;the address of the machine running dnsmasq&quot;. Data types allowed are comma separated dotted-quad IP addresses, a decimal number, colon-separated hex digits and a text string. If the optional tags are given then this option is only sent when all the tags are matched.</p></blockquote></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>-F, --dhcp-range=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;],][set:&lt;tag],]&lt;start-addr&gt;[,&lt;end-addr&gt;][,&lt;mode&gt;][,&lt;netmask&gt;[,&lt;broadcast&gt;]][,&lt;lease time&gt;]

When it is prefixed with &#039;tag:&#039; instead, then its meaning changes from setting a tag to matching it. Only one tag may be set, but more than one tag may be matched.</p></blockquote></div><p>You may get some clues in <em><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/backfire/package/dnsmasq/files/dnsmasq.init">package/dnsmasq/files/dnsmasq.init</a> </em>on how set/tag could be added to the configuration file.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeffster</strong> on 14 Feb 2013, 22:08)</p>

					<p>Uh, sounds a bit complicated. But thank you very much for your help, especially with pointing out the tag flag, I will try to study that and what it could do, but it won&#039;t be supported by uci for sure <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 15 Feb 2013, 11:27)</p>
