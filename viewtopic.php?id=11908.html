					<p>Dear Friends,</p><p>since kvm (virtualisation by kernel) is integrated in kernel mainline 2.6.20 I guess it is also available in openwrt.<br />If so, what possibilities do I have as user? One scenario acrossed my mind quickly. I must admit, I am no good hacker, more the user of openwrt.</p><p>So, hackers, tell me if I&#039;m on the very wrong way with this scenario:<br />- I have hardware, that runs with kernel 2.6, except the wifi-device (e.g. Asus wl-500g Deluxe, aka wl-500gD)<br />- because of some reasons I can&#039;t/won&#039;t use kernel 2.4<br />- one device (e.g. broadcom wifi) runs only with (proprietary) 2.4 kernel modules<br />- I would make a system in a system by running a virtual 2.4 kernel in the booted 2.6 kernel<br />- that virtual system does communicate with the (2.4) wifi-hardware and for that task presents a virtual network interface that is available for me in the running kernel</p><p>In my fantasy I walk through the &quot;make menuconfig&quot; of the openwrt Buildroot and select e.g.:<br />- Use kvm<br />- build virtual/alternate openwrt (minimal) subsystem (or show me the tree again, but preconfigured/depending on the &quot;main&quot; system)<br />- select special kernel modules only for the subsystem<br />- show options like &quot;configure virtual system/devices now&quot; and &quot;boot virtual system automatically&quot;</p><p>hmm, bad english, good idea?</p><p>bye Sven</p>									</div>

					<p>I think that you could better spend that effort in stabilizing broadcom wifi for the 2.6 kernel.</p>									</div>
