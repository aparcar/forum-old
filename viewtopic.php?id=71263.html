					<p>I tried all the ways, nano, micro simcard and full simcard, I guess you have to place a full simcard right because a nano, micro is too small for that sim card hole, anyway, firmware came with LuCI Trunk (svn-r10457) OpenWrt Barrier Breaker unknown. I have bought 4 and none of them are recognizing the simcard. So I wonder what to do next, looks like zbt employees are not working today and i need to finish setting things up. Can anybody help me with it, I would be very glad if anybody could.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Metroid</strong> on 18 Jun 2017, 07:24)</p>

					<p>Do you have a 4G modem card installed? The PCIe slot may have a 5 GHz 802.11ac card, cellular modem, or empty slot.&nbsp; The SIM card is only used with a modem installed.</p><p><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ZBT_WE826">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ZBT_WE826</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for you reply, yes I do, quectel.com/product/ec25, yes I have the EC25-A mini pci-e module installed which is for band 2, 4 and 12, my problem is that ZBT has placed a custom firmware which checks if the simcard is connected or not, is like a scan to check which devices are connected and so far the simcard could not get detected, it says, is not inserted and that is all. It has been a pain, I bought 4 devices, one I installed lede-17.01.2-ramips-mt7620-zbt-we826-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin but I cant make the simcard to be recognized too, opkg update and installed all 3g dongle usb packages interfaces that exist however this is a mini pci-e module card and the zbt we826 has a simcard slot however i have no idea how to insert the simcard or maybe I installed it right but is not getting recognized by the firmware. Its kind difficult. I sent an email to zbt, lets see if they can help me.</p><p>By the way on the custom zbt firmware has a 4g wan interface, but if the simcard can&#039;t be recognized that will not help, I wonder why this is happening, for me I wanted it to be plug and play. I use the band 2 and band 4 simcard US, Canada lte frequency.</p><p>This is how I think the simcard should be installed, facing upwards. Also as you can see on the 2 images, only a full sized simcard will be adequate to be installed, nano or micro is just too small, maybe any user here that owns a zbt-we826 could tell me if I placed the simcard right or wrong would help me a lot.</p><p>[img]scontent-gru2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/19389646_10156291054108626_318492381_n.jpg?oh=3a1b84b78f421cba00ef0b155bcd4321&amp;oe=5949B04F[/img]</p><br /><p>[img]scontent-gru2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/19389661_10156291054213626_1577257984_n.jpg?oh=2f89db072671897a1403d1c3cd86aa89&amp;oe=59486AEE[/img]</p><p>Any idea how I could make this to work? Anything is helpful.</p><p>Right now I&#039;m using it as an access point only, need this lte to work as fast as possible.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Metroid</strong> on 19 Jun 2017, 00:58)</p>
