					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m running trunk on a RouterStation Pro and would like to add the equivalent of the following iptables rules via luci or at least via /etc/config/firewall</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING  -i br-lan           ! -s $PROXYIP       -p tcp --dport 80   -j DNAT --to $PROXYIP:3128
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o br-lan           -s $LAN -d $PROXYIP                     -j SNAT --to $OPENWRTIP
iptables        -I FORWARD     -i br-lan -o br-lan -s $LAN -d $PROXYIP -p tcp --dport 3128 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>So far I have had no luck and ended up adding the commands to /etc/rc.local but then I have to make sure to remember to run them after changing any other normal firewall rules.</p><p>On a related note we have a pptp* based VPN which has a custom ip-up script (snippet below) that adds an accept rule for forwarded traffic on the appropriate interface. Unfortunately on a reload of the normal firewall rules this gets removed until the connection is restarted. Is there any way to avoid this?</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>if [ &quot;$IPLOCAL&quot; = &quot;$OPENWRTIP&quot; ]
then
    iptables -D FORWARD -o $PPP_IFACE -j ACCEPT
    iptables -I FORWARD -o $PPP_IFACE -j ACCEPT
    
    iptables -D FORWARD -i $PPP_IFACE -j ACCEPT
    iptables -I FORWARD -i $PPP_IFACE -j ACCEPT
fi</code></pre></div><p>Regards,<br />Andrew</p><p>* Yes, we will be replacing pptp with ipsec and l2tp at some point, but this problem will still remain</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi again everyone,</p><p>Since I got no replies to this I&#039;m assuming that either no one else is trying to do this or they&#039;ve also decided to do it separately to the luci interface.</p><p>So I&#039;ll pose another question:<br />For more esoteric iptables rules is there a mechanism for adding them automatically after the rest of the rules have been created and run?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Andrew</p>									</div>
