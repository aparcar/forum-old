					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m trying to monitor the counters of the switch ports on the WRT54GL (uses a broadcom switch). I see that the original WRT54G v2 had an ADM switch and you could access the counters in /proc/switch/eth0/counters, but there&#039;s nothing similar on the broadcom driver in the WRT54GL build.</p><p>If I could even get the total number of bytes or packets that the WRT54GL was switching I&#039;d be happy - I don&#039;t necessarily need per-port stats. When running ifconfig or watching tcpdump output I&#039;ll only ever see stats for broadcast traffic and traffic destined for the router itself. Even when running tcpdump on eth0 with a large file transfer going over the WAN port I&#039;ll still capture no traffic.</p><p>Note that I&#039;m running the router in a pure switch mode with ports 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all in one VLAN !</p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>^BUMP^</p><p>I am also definitely interested in this also.&nbsp; I have done some searching, but haven&#039;t really come up with much.&nbsp; I have a dual-NIC laptop that I want to use as an IDS.&nbsp; In the infrastructure world, I would set port monitoring on my core switch and plug the sensor into it.&nbsp; This is all coming from a Cisco background.&nbsp; How can we set one of the switchports on the WRT54GL to spanning mode, or tap mode, or promiscuous mode, or whatever you may call it.&nbsp; I want all traffic at the router to be visible to this single port for sniffing purposes.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>									</div>
