					<p>80 can be blocked by your isp and keep in mind it is unecrypted, so I&#039;d not recommend administering your router via port 80. You should administer your router via ssh or at least https.</p><p>If you want to do this, ssh to your router, run vi /etc/config/firewall, press a and add a rule like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option name &#039;web-on-wan&#039;
        option src &#039;wan&#039;
        option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
        option dest_port &#039;80&#039;
        option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>If you have port 80 blocked by your isp, you can make redirect like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config redirect
       option name &#039;web-on-wan&#039;
       option src              wan
       option src_dport        8080
       option dest             lan
       option dest_port        80
       option proto            tcp</code></pre></div><p>Then you can admin your router with http://router_public_ip:8080.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 31 Dec 2017, 17:21)</p>

					<p>Thank you for your reply nozombian!</p><p>I added both script to my firewall. Result: <strong>ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</strong>. I use the 8080 port for my NAS, so modified to 8088 but no luck.</p><p>I don&#039;t want use just the 80 port, but any other port not work if I try to access the router&#039;s webGUI. But it very important for me because I like to use WOL and sometimes I have to modify some settings mostly open/close ports for LAN IPs.</p><p>I don&#039;t think my ISP blocked. I have another router with ddwrt and that is work fine. Only openWRT not works.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, your&#039;e right, I&#039;m using Chrome (on my mobile as well). Yes, I want connect to LuCI webGUI via DDNS service (the port doesn&#039;t matter, if I can&#039;t use 80 I use 8088, or any other). The DDNS working well - I reach my NAS with that (the NAS port is 8080 and it is okay). I read that topic about rfc1918_filter &#039;1&#039; but it not helped. Same result with Firefox. Yes, later I will play with certs.</p><p>For now the only way to access the LuCI webGUI that use a completely different network - if I want remote access.</p><p><strong>Thank you for your help!</strong></p><p><em>Btw...
