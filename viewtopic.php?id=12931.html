					<p>Hi all,</p><p>After I could not find an irssi package that has been built with IPv6 enabled, I had to do my own.<br />I used the Makefile of scachi&#039;s ssl-enabled irssi, but reverted the configure changes to the settings used for the irssi of Kamikaze, except for the --enable-ipv6.<br />Therefore, this one does <em><strong>not</strong></em> have SSL and Perl support.</p><p>So if anybody wants to give it a try, I set up a single-package-repository here:<br /><a href="http://tesla.afthd.tu-darmstadt.de/~mmx/OpenWRT">http://tesla.afthd.tu-darmstadt.de/~mmx/OpenWRT</a> (add to ipkg.conf or append /Packages to get the list)</p><p>Note: the package name is irssi-v6 to avoid confusions with the irssi from backports, but the binary is called the same. So they will overwrite each other if both are installed.</p><p>Greetings . . . Martin</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>MMx</strong> on 10 Oct 2007, 18:06)</p>

					<p>Nice one, does it also work in kamikaze?<br />Now if only someone could build a <em>working</em> psybnc (or other bnc-software) with IPv6 support... .</p>									</div>

					<p>Hmm... finally got around to try it in kamikaze 7.07, and it won&#039;t.<br />After ipkg complaining that it can&#039;t find &quot;glib1&quot; and installing it from 0.9-backports (I know, not the best source), it succeeded installing. But when i try to start it, it just outputs &quot;Aborted&quot; and that&#039;s it.</p>									</div>
