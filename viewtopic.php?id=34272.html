					<p>VLAN-stuff get important if you have multiple accesspoints and you want to route the traffic in a secure way to your mainrouter (with the internet-uplink). In this case it would be a good idea to have 2 VLANs on your LAN to separate the &quot;privat&quot;- and &quot;guest&quot;-traffic over one ethernet-cable. This would increase the security and I would really recommend this.&nbsp; <br />If you have only one router which works as&nbsp; private- and guest-accesspoint you don&#039;t need to deal with VLANs. If you follow the documentation you will get a guest-wlan which is a separate virtual wifi-interface which is not bridged to your lan (and private wlan). So it&#039;s not on the same lan-segment as your private network. the firewall-rules are only needed to allow internet-access and you have to set this up even if you use VLANs. </p><p>So VLANs are usefull for a &quot;guest-lan&quot; or if you want to integrate many guest-accesspoints in your lan in a secure way, but there is no advantage if you want to setup up a guest-wlan on your main router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 23 Jan 2012, 17:30)</p>

					<p>I have been searching this for two weeks . Finally i figured out how to do it! I learned a lot of stuff i didnt know. About routing different subdomains , vlans , antenna theory POE types , cable types.</p><p>However searching for guest wifi etc didnt help. However this forum has ton of information <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Some AP/Routers have guest wifi from the box. Havent test it though how secure it is.</p><p>I havent found how to do it with VLAN but i&#039;ll get some equipment and try. Probably it needs some vlan routing rules for internet that might be easier i guess.</p>									</div>

					<p>In contrast to NICs, WNICs can operate in multiple modes.</p><p>If you want to imprison your &quot;guest&quot; in an own network, and they connect over the wireless, simply make your WNIC spawn a second AP for your &quot;guest&quot;, then configure ip addresses and also, adjust your firewall.</p>									</div>
