					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have overviewed some multi-nat guides on this forum, but all of them seems to refer port-forwarding from multiple wan address, rather then disabling NAT for the public subnet fully.</p><br /><p>I am looking for the following setup:</p><p>A LAN with 2 subnets: <br />--- 192.168.1.x range with DHCP, nat and any regular LAN features<br />--- public subnet -- 5 IPs from my ISP. I want to the route them directly to some hosts on the LAN (so that the PC/server is actually configured with public ip rather then 1-to-1 nat). This way the NAT is disabled fully for this subnet.</p><p>Both of these subnets should co-exist on the same physical LAN. </p><br /><br /><p>Any of your suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
