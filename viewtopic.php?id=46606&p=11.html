					<p>Hello taobaoDog,<br />I hope it is not misleading.<br />There is a patch &quot;100-remove-cryptoapi-dependencies.patch&quot;, which implements<br />aes functionality in the compat-wireless drivers (the crypto modules in the kernel can be left disabled making the kernel smaller in the end.).<br />&quot;compat-wireless&quot; for enabling the newer wireless drivers from kernel 4.x for kernel 3.18 i.e. <br />And openwrt is using compat-wireless, except for some platforms, where a relatively new kernel is used. And there is a rtlwifi in compat-wireless.<br />So it could be an idea to disable the rtlwifi in kernel_menuconfig and enable the (not exactly) kmod_xxx_rtlwifi in menuconfig with &quot;*&quot;<br />(&quot;M&quot; could mean to build an openwrt package with the kmods).<br />Recently learned:<br />Searching in the menuconfigs works with &quot;/&quot; similar to vi.<br />(I think the last time I have configured before was for a kernel was for 2.2.19. So there is, felt, 20 times more options now.<br />And OMG, where can I find the CONFIG_XX option? Could it not be like in Windows control panel? Yes it is. Linux has it. May be had it since longer times)</p><p>If it would be easy, everybody would do it</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello, I&#039;ve got bricked Dlink DAP-1513 with RTL8196C chipset (4M flash, 32M RAM). Flash chip is totally erased, including bootloader ((( Could anyone post a bootloader suitable for further recovering the full firmware. Flashing the chip with SPI programmer is not a problem.</p><p>I have found several bootloaders here in this thread, but they are for devices with different flash chip size (8M and 16M). Will they work with 4M?</p><p>Thank you.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ega2002</strong> on 18 Feb 2016, 00:41)</p>

Unfortunately it&#039;s not so easy to find anyone with the same device for cloning: the device is not so popular and moreover one will need a console to make a dump or desolder the flash chip (must open the device and break the warranty). So, as of now, I have no other way but try to use the dumps from other devices with the same chipset and memory sizes.</p><p>Anyway, <strong>andygo</strong>, thanks for sharing your considerations.</p>									</div>
