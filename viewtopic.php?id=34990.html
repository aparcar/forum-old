					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Has anybody attempted to reverse-engineer the pinouts of BCM4712 and BCM5352? At the very least, does anybody know if they both use a 336-ball BGA package? (BCM5352 does: <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/collateral/pb/5352EL-PB00-R.pdf">http://www.broadcom.com/collateral/pb/5352EL-PB00-R.pdf</a> but I&#039;m not sure about 4712; can&#039;t find a similar product brief for it).</p><p>I&#039;m attempting to find out if these chips are swappable, thus I&#039;d like to determine if they&#039;re pin-for-pin compatible, can tolerate the same voltage levels, have the same memory bus speed (or can adapt to slower speeds), etc.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>- S</p>									</div>
