					<p>I&#039;m trying to build OpenWrt for Raspberry Pi 3 such that it behaves like a typical router including a web interface for administration/configuration.</p><p>I couldn&#039;t find a pre-built image for the Raspberry Pi 3, so I used the instructions on the wiki page OpenWrt Wiki » Table of Hardware » Raspberry Pi Foundation » Raspberry Pi (and at least one other wiki page I found) to build my own image from the github repository (commit 871372c42a3fc9c4b33f5c6011742d610a2e5600, dated 2/5/2017).</p><p>The image does run on the board, but there is no web interface. Are there build options that I need to change in order to make the board behave like a full-featured router with a web interface? Right now it seems like the default build options just get the board up and running as a standard embedded system.</p>									</div>

					<p>@ulmwind Thanks for the suggestion to try LEDE. I tried out the latest LEDE image and it works well on the board and provides router functionality with a web interface. I still want to get OpenWrt running on the board though if possible.</p><p>Out of curiosity I also used the LEDE image builder to build an image, and found that the default build also didn&#039;t provide a web interface. Looking a little closer, I noticed that additional packages could be included via the image builder.</p><p>I suspect that the web interface is an optional package in LEDE, and similarly in OpenWrt. If this is the case, how could I find out which packages are required to get the full router-like functionality I&#039;m after with web interface in an OpenWrt build?</p>									</div>

					<p><strong>daveberg</strong>, web-interface is called Luci. In menuconfig there should to be option <strong>Luci</strong>. It comes from feeds-luci (you should run </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci</code></pre></div><p> initially). OpenWRT also has ImageBuilder, I don&#039;t know, if it exists for the case of Raspberry Pi 3.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ulmwind</strong> on 22 Feb 2017, 21:40)</p>
