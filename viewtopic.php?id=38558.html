					<p>Hello.<br />I have an ADSL router running Openwrt, with the network switch splitted into two vlans. I use port1 as WAN the the other 3 ports as LAN. My router gets an IP from another network device (i&#039;ll call it GW) and runs it&#039;s own DHCP server for the LAN. My problem appears when I reboot my openwrt and my LAN clients are asking for a new IP. At startup, before the network services start and vlans are configured, the switch on my openwrt bridges all ports, so the DHCP requests from clients on my LAN get to my WAN network device (GW), and GW assigns them an IP address. When the openwrt finishes booting, the LAN clients already have their IP configured, but from the wrong server, GW should assign IP only to openwrt, not to the LAN clients.</p><p>I tried to force clients to update IP, when openwrt starts, by putting </p><p>ifdown eth0.1 (LAN)<br />sleep (2000)<br />ifup eth0.1</p><p>in a script at startup, but I had no luck.<br />Can anyone tell me how could I solve this? Thank you.</p>									</div>
