					<p>Well okay, running the script itself just returns <br />&quot;add_protocol not found&quot;</p><p>When I comment out the last three lines of the script it runs, without any other further information.</p><p>I tested latest official snapshot for WRT3200 and it is the same problem here. No IPv4 connection is established (not on the router, nor any client). What could be wrong? It&#039;s working on an old Linksys E4200 (but horribly slow).</p><p>Thanks for every input.

					<p>You are right, I will post another thread for this issue.</p><p>I haven&#039;t read much of this thread, with over 200 pages it&#039;s way too much to &quot;just get into&quot;, I firstly thought it might be related to this build since trunk works on another device with the same setup procedure. <br />Sorry for the mess, maybe a mod can delete the unnecessary posts I made in here?</p>									</div>
