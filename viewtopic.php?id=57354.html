					<p>Fwknopd, written by Michael Rash, over at Cipherdyne (<a href="http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/">http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/</a>) is a port knocking daemon that uses a single encrypted packet, rather than a port knocking sequence. </p><p>I&#039;ve put together a Luci interface for openwrt, and it&#039;s now in trunk. luci-app-fwknopd is ready for use. It will take a couple days for the packages to get built by the buildbots, but it can be compiled now.</p><p>If the fwknop client is installed as well as the luci app, keys are autogenned on the first reboot after install. The keys aren&#039;t enabled until a box is checked in the luci interface. </p><p>Go forth and test, use, and feel free to ask questions or make suggestions.</p>									</div>

(Seriously, don&#039;t leave port 22 open. It&#039;s asking for trouble)</p><p>fwknopd can listen for a signed packet with no ports open. So if you want to ssh in, you run the fwknop client, and tell fwknopd to open port 22 for only the ip address you are using, and it only does so for a default of 120 seconds. Long enough to ssh in and establish the connection, but after that 120 seconds, the router goes back to blocking new incoming connections.</p><p>So, your router is invisible to a port scan, but you still have a secure way to log in remotely.</p>									</div>

There are two reasons not to have port 22 open. The first is the danger of flaws that we don&#039;t know about. A zero day flaw could be disasterous, but even more likely is a flaw that is reported and fixed, but the fix never pushed to the device hosting ssh. </p><p>The more immediate reason is that an open port 22 is like hanging out a sign. I&#039;ve watched server logs for ssh when 22 is open. The volume of attempts against root is staggering. </p><p>If you want an open ssh service, I&#039;d encourage either using something like fwknopd, or at least moving to a nonstandard port above 1024.</p>									</div>

There is documentation in other places, but I&#039;ll try to pull a quick blurb together for the wiki. To get you started:</p><p>The easiest way to use fwknop on Openwrt is to use the Luci interface, luci-app-fwknopd. This installation will generate your keys and give you a sane config file. Once installed, just go to the luci page (Services -&gt; Firewall Knock Daemon) and check the box labeled &quot;Enable config overwrite&quot; and then save and apply.&nbsp; </p><p>From there you just need an fwknop client and you should be good to go. There is an Android client that is very easy to set up. It&#039;s in the play store and named fwknop2.&nbsp; This client allows you to import the generated keys via qr codes. Another option is the new cross-platform desktop graphical client over at <a href="https://incomsystems.biz/fwknop-gui/">https://incomsystems.biz/fwknop-gui/</a></p><p>There is also the command line client. More information here: <a href="https://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/">https://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/</a> This is the main fwknop site and has lots more documentation.</p><p>If you get too badly stuck, you can ask the fwknop community directly by using the mailing list at fwknop-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</p><p>Hope you get it working. Fwknop really is a slick idea and much more secure than the old port-knocking idea.</p><p>--Jonathan Bennett</p>									</div>

					<p>The error that is causing problems is the parse error on access port entry.&nbsp; I think it wants to see either a tcp/54321 or a udp/54321.&nbsp; If you have ssh listening on 54321, then you would want tcp/54321.</p><p>So specifically, it looks like in the Luci interface, you set OPEN_PORTS: to 54321. You can leave that blank to allow the SPA packet to specify the port. If you want to specify the port to open here, you need to also specify the protocol. So, either blank the OPEN_PORTS field, or set it to something like tcp/54321</p><p>I definitely need to write a wiki page on this.

					<p>Following the hints in this thread I also managed to make fwknopd work to open port 22 on my Chaos Calmer Openwrt. Works nice, thanks!</p><p>Next step will be to try to configure multiple open ports and to chain commands after the reception of a packet (e.g. do port forwarding as with knockd).</p>									</div>

					<p>avio, glad it worked for you.&nbsp; You should actually have port forwarding working out of the box.&nbsp; Look into the Nat Access message type.&nbsp; Let me know which client you are using, and I can give more specific info.</p>									</div>
