					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve been a total idiot with my new and now already &#039;broken&#039;&nbsp; router and was hoping someone could help me to get it working again.<br />The first thing i did was to flash it with <br />openwrt-ar71xx-wrt160nl-squashfs.bin which didn&#039;t complete. So then i tried <br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wrt160nl-squashfs-factory.bin which actually did complete.</p><p>However. now i cant reach the control panel anymore.<br />I do get an ip address and i can ping the router.<br />I can also connect through telnet and execute these failsafe commands:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt160nl</a><br />or navigate in the directory structure, but with no real results.<br />I have little to none experience with linux or where i&#039;d need to go to configure or reflash it this way (if that&#039;s even possible).</p><p>In the above link they also&nbsp; show some pictures of a serial console, 1 internal option, and one on top of a rj45 connector<br />If these are just some connectors connected with some usb cable, then i have the tools and i can do this. But if there is programming involved then i would be totally lost. But at this point this is totally unclear to me. Also, those pictures don&#039;t seem to give enough information to actually know what to connect to what.</p><p>I hope someone can point me in the right direction, because i&#039;m lost.</p>									</div>

					<p>Perfect. <br />Thank you so much,<br />I totally missed that piece of information. So there is a way to restore it within the reach of my skills. this is very good to know.</p><p>I thought about it some more though, and decided i want such a serial connection (i bought the router for openwrt). The way i understand it, its just a serial port connector/cable, connected to the pins in the router and nothing more, which would be totally doable for me.<br />However, what i don&#039;t know is&nbsp; how to connect it, and if the 5v needs to become 3.3 first.</p><p>router:<br />+3.3v<br />TX<br />TR<br />NC <br />GND</p><p>serial:<br />GND<br />+5v<br />GND<br />TD+<br />TD-<br />+12<br />EC<br />RD+<br />RD-<br /><a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.04/04.06/SerialPortDemo/img009.gif">http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech â€¦ img009.gif</a></p>									</div>

					<p>So if i understand it right, this is what i must make:<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://www.embraceit.com.au/wgt624/WGT624SerialDiagram.jpg" alt="http://www.embraceit.com.au/wgt624/WGT624SerialDiagram.jpg" /></span><br />or<br /><span class="postimg"><img src="http://sodoityourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/circuit_232.jpg" alt="http://sodoityourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/circuit_232.jpg" /></span></p><p>Is this assumption correct, or are these diagrams unique per routertype?</p><p>Are there more diagrams out there in case i cant find the right ic?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>trendpoinder2</strong> on 26 Jan 2012, 10:58)</p>

					<p>I was able to flash the original (upgraded) firmware with the option fiy suggested (wget from telnet), i tried to flash openwrt again, but it again didnt work.</p><p>I made the circuit from my previous post, but it didnt work (should it have?) I might have broken some components due to incorrect connecting, <br />is &quot;USB TTL RS232 adapter PL2303&quot;. the same as the circuit from my post? <br />also, will i be able to flash the firmware that way as it is consistantly failing through the webupgrade page?</p>									</div>
