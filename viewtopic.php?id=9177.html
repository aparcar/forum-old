					<p>Sorry if this an idiotic question but I can&#039;t find anything about this in the documentation or in this forum. </p><p>I have a Linksys WRT54GL (V1.1) and a WAP54G (V2) both flashed with White Russian RC6 (standard image for the first, micro for the latter). Both are working fine so far, the WRT54GL acting as AccessPoint, the WAP54G acting as client.<br />So, on my old D-Link DWL900AP+ there is some kind of log file and a status page where you can see information what clients are currently connected and so on. Yeah, this is some very useful information and I doubt that only D-Link has this... So, but I don&#039;t know how to view such informations on my White Russian RC6 boxes. I&#039;ve updated webif^2 on the WRT54GL to latest version, but there is also no section with this informations.</p><p>So, can I somewhere see such things? Or better: how? And is there a way to see the quality of an existing WLAN connection?</p><p>Many thanks! And please excuse my english</p>									</div>
