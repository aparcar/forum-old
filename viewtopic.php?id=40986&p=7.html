					<p>Thank you for your answer.</p><p>That&#039;s my USB to Serial on top, so I can have Serial and power at the same time with only one USB.<br />I got it on eBay ( <a href="http://cgi.ebay.fr/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=251102584727">http://cgi.ebay.fr/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie … 1102584727</a> ) chose it for size and price. I just de-soldered the pins and USB plug, trimmed a bit excess PCB and soldered to the right pins. I wanted to add an internal USB hub too (hence the wires on the right) but I stupidly fried the hub and had to resolder the original Female USB on the left). There(s still plenty of room inside, and you can&#039;t tell it was modified, apart from the fact that I replaced the USB micro-b female with a USB A male (so I don&#039;t need an extra cable).</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://stuff.knackes.com/dld/201301/20130126_211501-cr_D183BE62.jpg" alt="http://stuff.knackes.com/dld/201301/20130126_211501-cr_D183BE62.jpg" /></span></p>									</div>

					<p>I got my WR703n working with the modified firmware that was uploaded on page 4 or 5. However I would like to use USBip. When I got to install that package, I get a kernal error. If I force it, it says it doesn&#039;t have enough memory on overlay. If I flash the modified package and then upgrade to the latest release, it works great until I restart the device, then I go back to no connectivity. <br />Is there anyway to change what has been modified at the command prompt? I do have serial access to the device. Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I followed <a href="http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Install_OpenWRT_on_TPlink_WR703N">this guide</a> to set up my&nbsp; TL-WR703N v1.7 using the latest trunk snapshot (except using psk2 instead of psk), and I get the following message when I run the wifi command (just like dale_para_bajo reported):</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# wifi
command failed: Device or resource busy (-16)
Successfully initialized wpa_supplicant</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>I also get a bunch of error messages in the log:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>[ 3268.210000] ath: phy0: DMA failed to stop in 10 ms AR_CR=0x00000024 AR_DIAG_SW=0x02000020 DMADBG_7=0x00024e00

That I fixed by adding this to /etc/resolve.cfg:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nameserver 8.8.8.8</code></pre></div><p> </p><p>Which is Google&#039;s public DNS server. This is only temporary though, and gets erased when you reboot.

					<p>to know the revision of any build on openwrt download server look at the first rows of config file, for example:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/ar71xx/generic/config.ar71xx_generic">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … xx_generic</a></p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/config">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … 1xx/config</a></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks! I see the snapshots from today has:<br /># OpenWrt version: Barrier Breaker (r35604)<br /># Fri Feb 15 11:40:43 2013</p><p>and AA has:<br /># OpenWrt version: Attitude Adjustment (r34185)<br /># Sun Nov 18 01:44:27 2012</p><p>So does that mean that the snapshots version should work with the v1.7 since r35604&gt;r35037<br />(and conversely the reason you said &quot;Wrong choice&quot; yesterday for the Attitude Adjustment was that it is at r34185)?</p><p>To clarify, I should be able to either install the current bleeding edge (but possibly with newly introduced bugs):<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … actory.bin</a></p><p>or else use your patch in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/npiapitjpq4ygzs/">https://www.dropbox.com/s/npiapitjpq4ygzs/</a><br />openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-AArc1-r34185-eth-fix.zip</p><p>which has the openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin<br />suitable for web upload. (did I read correctly that someone with a wr703n tried this and it worked?)</p><p>Is this right?</p>									</div>

					<p>Bleeding edge does work on my router. I can not get usbip to work, however. When I try to install it on bleeding edge, I get unknown package &#039;usbip&#039;. When I try to install it with nebbia88&#039;s fix I don&#039;t have enough space and the kernals do not line up.<br />What&#039;s the best way of getting usbip to work?<br />Thanks guys.</p>									</div>
