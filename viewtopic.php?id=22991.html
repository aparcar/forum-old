					<p>After further testing it does look like there might be a bug or two in bridge.</p><p>First, the MAC address that get&#039;s created depends on the sequence in which network interfaces are created, but is otherwise stable, i. e. you&#039;ll get the same one every boot. Seeding /dev/urandom early in the boot (as the first script in /etc/rc.d/S*) does not alter the MAC address at all.</p><p>Secondly, changing the MAC address vie ifconfig or network.lan.macaddr does give the appearance of having changed the address (i. e. ifconfig and brctl show show the new address), but packets stop from being received properly, and the original mac address appears to be still used somewhere in the stack, i. e. I&#039;m still getting the &quot;received packet with own address&quot; error, and brctl showmacs shows the old address as a local one.</p><p>Not sure how to proceed from here, other than digging into the source.</p>									</div>

					<p>And I&#039;ve now checked with Wireshark: the packets on the wire (ethernet) are indeed OK, but things get lost internally. One interesting detail from the Wireshark trace is that the ICMP replies from OpenWrt have their checksum field zeroed. This does not happen when I don&#039;t change the MAC address (i.e. when everything is working).</p><p>You can see the confusion here:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@delta:/# ifconfig -a|grep Ether

					<p>To finish this off: upgrading to r18957 fixed the root problem, so all the workarounds became unneccessary, and everything is working out of the box.</p>									</div>
