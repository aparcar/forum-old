					<p>I have a Linksys WRT160N with the latest OpenWrt installed for it, and I cannot seem to get the darn thing to pass thru the Internet to the ports.&nbsp; The line from another router works fine on one of the computers, but when I plug that line into the yellow (WAN) port, nothing comes thru.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried what ever I could think of but am at a loss.&nbsp; Its probably something obvious, but apparently not to me.</p><p>The main router is 192.168.1.1, and this one is 192.168.1.5.&nbsp; The main one does not see it on its device list, which is an obvious worry.&nbsp; Every computer off the main router sees the Internet.</p><p>What have I missed?</p>									</div>

					<p>OpenWrt&#039;s default configuration use 192.168.1.x for the LAN network, if the main router also uses 192.168.1.x for its LAN network, then your OpenWrt device is configured as 192.168.1.x on both the LAN and WAN networks, and that is going to cause trouble.</p><p>You can configure the OpenWrt device to use 192.168.0.x for the LAN, or you can even configure it as a dumb access point.</p>									</div>

Let it be 192.168.1.5. Make sure static lease is present or &quot;1.5&quot; is not in the dynamic assignment range.</p><p>Edit LAN interface. Change protocol to &quot;Static address&quot;. Fill the fields.<br />In DHCP server section check &quot;Ignore interface&quot;.<br />In DHCP server - ipv6 settings - disable &quot;Router advertisement service&quot;, dhcpv6, NDP proxy.<br />Save&amp;apply.</p><p>Edit WAN interface, uncheck &quot;Bring up on boot&quot;, save&amp;apply, stop interface. WAN port is no more used.</p><p>Connect any lan port of the main router to any lan port of the secondary router. Thats it. Secondary router now serves as additional switch + wifi bridge. Static address is useful in case of main router failure.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 16 Dec 2016, 16:26)</p>
