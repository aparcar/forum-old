					<p>download client you can use is aria2, take note, this is not a download manager, just a download client, its just a revamp version of wget that can download files in more protocols.</p><p>you can also use Pyload, a download manager based on python, you will need a extroot for this one since the packages alone will require you around 40MB of space and pyload it self is around 10MB uncompressed and may get bigger as it dowloads the latest plugins and whatnot. The only disadvantage for now is pyload doesnt work fully on OpenWRT, at least in BB and above due to missing packages, specially js which is critical to pyload&#039;s plugin functionality if you dont have js, it is gurantee that you will not be able to download properly 95% of the filehosting site, pyload can work just fine in AA assuming you still have the old repository package required installed.</p>									</div>
