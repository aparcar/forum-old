					<p>I have a problem in getting WAN side access to work. Haven&#039;t even looked at the wireless side yet.</p><p>My router is Buffalo WHR-G54S-2 router, and I&#039;m using buildroot-ng to build the OpenWrt image. From the beginning, LAN side access has been working great. Now I managed to setup the WAN side interface also - with vconfig. ifconfig shows it as interface eth0.1. eth0 is configured with the LAN side IP. </p><p>The problem is, when trying to ping a WAN address, the router just keeps sending ARP queries. Seems it just doesn&#039;t process the ARP replies (or drops them somewhere along the road). I&#039;ve tried changing the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/.../arp_ignore values, but that doesn&#039;t seem to have any effect.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok. Maybe should have read the documentation shipped with buildroot-ng more carefully. By editing the file /etc/config/network according to instructions in <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/branches/buildroot-ng/openwrt/docs/network.txt">/docs/network.txt</a> I seem to have gotten a working WAN/LAN system. </p><p>But still it is a bit weird that I couldn&#039;t get the same result with vconfig and ifconfig. Anyway, now let&#039;s see about WLAN...</p>									</div>
