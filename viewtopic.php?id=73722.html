					<p>Hi there,</p><p>I was unable to recon the place where should I add a new hardware button. There is a lot of documentation on how to configure a known button (like BTN_1) but I was unable to find where could I define a new GPIO pin.</p><p>I&#039;m using a LinkIt Smart distribution (CC 15.05) on MT7688, and I want to define a GPIO (say 15) to behave as failsafe/firstboot if I&#039;m holding it for 10 seconds while booting. </p><p>Where should I configure this? Thanks in advance!</p><p>Thanks,<br />Cezane</p>									</div>
