					<p>Hi all, I finally got around to building and installing OpenWRT for myself and have a few questions I&#039;d like to ask. Of course I&#039;ve searched the wiki etc but since I&#039;m new to this I haven&#039;t fully answered my questions properly yet.</p><p>I&#039;ve built r32643 which was the latest when I did this yesterday. It&#039;s running on my Buffalo WHR-G301N and I&#039;m using luci for all configuration until I learn more. </p><p>1. From what I can see uhttpd is set to listen on 0.0.0.0:80 by default, which I haven&#039;t changed. This means it&#039;s accepting connections from the internet right? not just from my lan? However when I did a port scan from grc.com and also telnetted to port 80 (and also port 22 to check), the connection was refused in all cases. <br />Further reading led me to believe I&#039;d need to change some firewall rules to actually allow connections from outside my lan? <br />Just to be clear, I actually DON&#039;T want anyone to be able to connect from outside my lan. So if I don&#039;t do anything it&#039;s OK as it is? Should I change uhttpd (and dropbear) to listen only to connections from 192.168.1.* ?? or there&#039;s no point and it&#039;s fine as it is now?</p><p>2. When I first installed, in the interfaces section of luci there was a LAN (br-lan) and WAN (eth1) interface. I added one more called &#039;modem&#039; to allow me to connect to the internet through my cable modem (using pppoe). Do i still need the WAN interface? Both the LAN and MODEM interfaces have a constantly updating uptime, but WAN stays at 0 all the time. However all of them show numbers for the amount of bytes/packets sent and received.</p><p>3. When the router starts up the pattern of LEDs flashing is different to what it was with the default buffalo firmware. The &quot;power&quot; and &quot;diag&quot; leds come on first and stay on for a while, then the &quot;router&quot; light comes on. After another short while the &quot;router&quot; light flashes for a while, then stays solid again. At first I thought the flashing meant there was an error but everything is working fine as far as I can tell (also there&#039;s nothing obviously wrong in the system or kernel logs). Is there any info on what the normal LED sequence should be and what will happen if there really is an error? Is the sequence specific to my router, or the same for all?</p><p>That&#039;s all for now, thanks in advance!</p>									</div>

					<p>1. While uhttp listens for any connection you can&#039;t connect from the internet because the default firewall rules deny any connection from wan. See &quot;option input REJECT&quot;&nbsp; in the wan section of /etc/config/firewall). That is perfectly fine.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mwarning</strong> on 8 Jul 2012, 14:06)</p>
