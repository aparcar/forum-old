					<p>Most supported routers do have Wireless capability, but you don&#039;t have to activate the Wirelessâ€¦ in fact, if I remember correctly, Wireless is switched off by default in OpenWRT, so just leave it off. (Also, you don&#039;t need to attach the antennas, and you can probably also open the router and disconnect the wireless card on some routers).</p><p>I think it is safe to assume that all OpenWRT routers will work perfectly without Wireless enabled (as long as they have more than one Ethernet port, of course).</p><p>Without Binary Blobs? I guess you mean that you want it to be 100% open source, and no binaries produced by companies that you don&#039;t completely trust. Well, the good news is that the binary blobs are usually the Wireless drivers <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> and you don&#039;t want those anyway. I don&#039;t know of any other non-open blobs that are in used, but I suggest you do more research or get information from someone who knows this better than I do.</p><p>Note that you can use the Image Builder/Image Generator to produce your own OpenWRT image, and you can choose specifically to not include the Wireless drivers (which will make sure the blobs are not even on your router).</p><p>If you just want a router - no advanced features - even an old proven WRT54GL will work with the latest Barrier Breaker for you (as long as you keep Wireless disabled: it has too little memory to successfully run Wireless). Perhaps a really old and proven thing feels more &quot;trusted&quot; for you, than something that was manufactured last month in China. You can probably get a used one for a very good price.</p><p>I hope this was helpful.</p>									</div>
