					<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;d like to inquire about the status and ETA of the 802.11ac routers support. The &quot;Supported Hardware&quot; table has 3 routers listed, although none of them are supported yet (as I understand).</p><p>What is the cause of the delay? Are vendors not releasing necessary source code? From the past experience (of the gap between product release and code release), when is it likely to happen?</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>

The problem is that the only device having OpenWrt images available (Archer C7) has an old, buggy, version of the 802.11ac chip (with no support in ath10k). Sitecom WLR-8100 has the newer chip, but I don&#039;t think any of the developers have actual hardware to work on it.</p>									</div>

Batman/open-mesh doesn&#039;t have possible tcp overhead nor possible iptables related overhead but I don&#039;t feel comfortable risking my money just yet. I have 2 archer C7 V1&#039;s on native firmware doing buggy (probably not 4 address) WDS bridging right now already. <br />TP-Link probably knows a lof of their router&#039;s success is due to openwrt working so well on a lot of their models. They should pressure aetheros and broadcom into releasing pristine opensource drivers a little more.</p><p>With the release of the newer (probably cheaper to make) archer C9 which is not compatible with openwrt I&#039;m also getting worried the door to a 11ac mesh is slowly closing behind me. How long will the C7 V2 still be for sale.. By now all the models who are going to be sold have probably been made and shipped. Buy now and cross fingers speed issues are going to get fixed ?? Or wait and risk future routers are not going to be openwrt compatible at all.. </p><p>source: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53703">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=53703</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phoenixxl</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 06:56)</p>

					<p>ath10k drivers are still being optimized unfortunately. Ath9k for 802.11n wasn&#039;t totally reliable until well after AC hardware was out. The same may happen with ath10k and 802.11ad release. If you&#039;re not using a trunk build, try that as there have been several improvements to the driver, as well as 802.11ac support added in Luci. </p><p>There are several routers out there now with the same or similar chipset as the C7 V2, with similar support in OpenWrt - Zyxel NBG6716, D-Link DGL-5500, Engenius ESR1750, and probably more, so I think you&#039;ll still have options on this type of hardware. </p><p>I&#039;m waiting to upgrade until QCA IPQ806x is available with dual-core ARM CPUs. Oh and I probably need to get some 802.11ac devices first too!</p>									</div>

					<p>Luci and AC devices aren&#039;t issues for me. The batman mesh for which I use the 1043&#039;s is doing the job that cabling can&#039;t do. Each router is connected to a lan segment in otherwise inaccessible parts of the building. The current setup is working very well. I&#039;m not sure there will be a luci setup page for open-mesh/batman any time soon. Not that it&#039;s needed tbh. If one can&#039;t handle some shell and some config files one probably shouldn&#039;t be messing with meshes.</p><p>My speeds with uncompressible data over the single wds bridge with the archer C7 V1&#039;s really make me want to use AC for everything. I do hope that other routers become a viable option as well.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>phoenixxl</strong> on 2 Mar 2015, 07:35)</p>
