					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have some simple code added via the documented route as a package to kamikaze, and it builds with the executable present when it tftps to the target linksys box.</p><p>Have it got it right that you can just upload the package to the linksys via the ipkg command, rather than building and flashing the whole router each time?</p><p>I have tried hacking the /etc/ipkg.conf to point to my devel box web server and done the ipkg list, but when I try to install my package I get</p><p>&#039;root@OpenWrt:/usr# ipkg install mcast<br />Installing mcast (1.0-1) to root...<br />Downloading <a href="http://192.168.1.2/packages/./mcast_1.0-1_mipsel.ipk">http://192.168.1.2/packages/./mcast_1.0-1_mipsel.ipk</a><br />Nothing to be done<br />Done.<br />Collected errors:<br />Package mcast md5sum mismatch.

					<p>It looks like the ipkg.conf changes you made were effective. It is obtaining the package from your 192.168.1.2 system. </p><p>After any change to the ipkg.conf you&#039;ll need to do an &quot;ipkg update&quot;. Did you already do that? If you did then I suspect there are problems with the package itself or maybe the package repository index on your 192.168.1.2 system.</p>									</div>
