					<p>hello:</p><p>i have a hootoo nano running openwt whose password i have forgotten and cant seem to recover it. i have read (and attempted) to access failsafe on the router both by hitting the reset button at multiple points and by trying to find the correct point using a wireshark capture. no luck. in fact i cant even find any packet that seems to match the failsafe announcement.</p><p>any help would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>thanks,<br />j</p>									</div>

					<p>ok- after a few more attempts i was presented access via ssh. here are steps i used:</p><p>1 Power off the device<br />2 Set a static ip for the device you are connecting from on the 192.168.1.0 network<br />3 Open a command prompt and start a continuous “ping 192.168.1.1 -t”<br />4 Connect a cable to the router’s LAN PORT<br />5 power on device<br />6 ping will fail throughout the boot cycle, but <strong>there is a small window when the device will respond to ping</strong>, at that time press and hold the reset button for about 10 seconds, connect to LAN PORT, and you can connect to the device on 192.168.1.1</p><p>hitting during the first few ping responses was the key. also, i think i only hit the button once rather than a long hold down.</p><p>good luck!<br />j</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jaschoon</strong> on 10 Mar 2017, 23:40)</p>
