					<p>Hello! I have a bricked AG214 gateway by Linksys. I wat to build a jtag cable for it, but on the router there are four different jtags inputs: a 14 pin called JP1, a 10-pin called JP2, another 14 pin called JP3 and a 5 pin JP4. The JP1 is damaged so I want to use another JPx input, but I don&#039;t know what type of cable I need (I haven&#039;t found schematics, I found a good site for my specific gateway here: <a href="http://ag241.ickz.com/node/19">http://ag241.ickz.com/node/19</a> but it doesn&#039;t explain how to make cable). Someone can hepl me? Thanx</p>									</div>
