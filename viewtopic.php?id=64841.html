					<p>Hi I have bin thinking about building a x86 router, but here in the UK some of the parts seem very expensive. EG I looked at a SuperMicro A1SRi-2758F [Server Board] for £400 <br />There is no way I am dropping £400 on just a mobo for a router lol.</p><p>I don&#039;t have a lot of money so I was planning to buy it piece by piece.<br />So any one have any pointers?<br />The other thing that can be a pane for me is working out what case the boards will fit in as I am blind and the descriptions on some of the websites can be lacking to say the least. 2 lan ports will be OK for me I can just use my wdr3600 or my c7as a switch - wifi accesspoints.</p>									</div>

					<p>If you don&#039;t have the money then your best bet is to do what I do: I go through the electrical recycle rubbish. This is where all my routers and PCs have come from. Alternatively, if you know someone that is going to upgrade their system, maybe they can donate their old one to you rather than throw it out.</p><p>Can you elaborate more about your plan for a x86 router? That&#039;s a pretty expensive motherboard that you were looking at. Maybe there is a cheaper alternative to achieve your goal.</p>									</div>

					<p>A router tends to be running 24/7, in contrast to a workstation running only a couple of hours a day, power consumption does play a big role there. In the past, most x86 systems needed around 130 watts idle. sandy-bridge managed to roundabout half that and ivy-bridge halved that again, a modern haswell or skylake system can go down to 10-15 watts idle (and a router is pretty much idle 98% of the time) and if you select your system properly (Atom range, single voltage boards, etc.) you can easily reach &lt;=6 watts idle without really trying anything special.</p><p>Even if you like dumpster diving, for always-on systems you pay dearly through electricity by going with an older desktop-/ workstation (or beware, server class-) system. Easily significantly more than what you&#039;d pay for a brandnew system in a year. When you add wlan to the needs, the costs of two wlan cards, antennas and pigtails also easily cost as much as a complete higher end (compatible) consumer router.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>slh</strong> on 15 May 2016, 22:12)</p>

					<p>Can&#039;t say I like &quot;dumpster diving&quot;, but if my choice is to have nothing or have something then I&#039;ll take it. I have not earned or been paid a single penny since I suffered a stroke, I have been assigned to said &quot;dumpster&quot;. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>That aside,&nbsp; I&#039;m not really convinced that the OP&#039;s main consideration is 24/7 power consumption costs. It feels there is some other reasoning behind the choice. We&#039;ll see. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi yes power consumption is a thing for me as power is not cheep here. I am all for reusing old hardware but the power usage in this situation is just to grate. </p><p>I am not after a server class bored. I just want a x86 router that can do 200 meg down and QOS with about 40 devices spread over 3 APs + run a dns baste adblocker, ping wochdog and a bit of power left over for more things as they crop up. I plan to run Gargoyle I think.<br />what about this?<br /><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Partaker-B5-Business-Office-Mini-Pc-with-5th-Gen-Intel-14nm-Quad-Core-N3150-Processor/800900_32550695648.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product … 95648.html</a></p><p>But I cant by it from that site as my fucking screen reader will not work with the part of the site were you select the ram and storage.</p>									</div>

					<p>I had the same motherboard and it works great with OpenWRT. 8-core is little too powerful so I just run VMWare on it and only use 2 cores on it and still manage to get 700mbit-ish soft-NAT. If I assign 1 more core on it, I can hit the gigabit speed barrier but my internet connection is no where near on it so I just limit it with 2 cores, I can run it with 1 core but well, its better to have those 2 cores just in case.</p><p>the rest of the cores runs on my XPnology NAS. Because OpenWRT samba speeds is very very terrible, I really want all this things run on OpenWRT but its just not able to do it.</p><p>If youre tight in budget, just buy the other general consumer based boards like a J2900 based SoC motherboards, that would be enough to drive a full gigabit WAN. Then just add a few couple of bucks for Dual or Quad port Intel NIC and youre good to go. Most J2900 based motherboards had a half-height mini pcie port that you can use to insert a compatible wifi card for openwrt. At least in this way it will be a lot cheaper. Power consumption wise, with only the board and a quad nic card and a 8GB flash drive, it only consumes 17watts at full load.</p>									</div>
