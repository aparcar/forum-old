					<p>I&#039;m routing most of my traffic through a SSN tunnel proxy running on my router to a server in the US. But I want to QoS that traffic, so that my FTP traffic is de-prioritized. How can I do this?</p><p>I can have my FTP client use a different proxy from my browser. I could easily create multiple SSH tunnels and bind them to different ports, but the tunnels all go out as port 22 to the US server. How can I QoS based on the incoming port, not the outgoing port?</p><p>Could I potentially create another IP as an &quot;alias&quot;, QoS that IP, and use that as the low priority tunnel?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
