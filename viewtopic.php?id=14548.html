					<p>I am trying to create a music player and have done the following so far:</p><p>1. Flashed with K7.09<br />2. Intalled ipkg wl<br />3.

Installed audio support ipkg-s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; kmod-usb-audio<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; kmod-soundcore<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; kmod-alsa<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sox<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; alsa-utils<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; libltdl<br />5. Installed mpd and modified mpd.conf<br />6. Followed <a href="http://sokrates.mimuw.edu.pl/~sebek/openwrt/">http://sokrates.mimuw.edu.pl/~sebek/openwrt/</a> instructions and created the file /etc/modules.d/72-snd-usb-audio</p><p>Rebooted</p><p>a. dmesg showed that my soundcard is detected<br />b. usbutils showed the card<br />c. dsp, mixer and mixer1 are created in /dev/sound<br />d. lsmod shows that all the modules defined in 72-snd-usb-audio are loaded</p><p>Created the mpd database with mpd --create-db and started mpd. My mpd client machine is a Vista box running BJJ. It connects to mpd, shows all the files and I can play a song. BJJ shows that song is playing.</p><p>The light where my headphone is connected on the USB card starts blinking, it was solid before. I follow BJJ to the end of the song and then the light stops blinking.</p><p>But here&#039;s the bottomline - NO sound!</p><p>The USB soundcard tests ok on Windows machines with good sound, so that&#039;s working. The headphone is the one that I use all the time, so that&#039;s working too and even tested with the same soundcard.</p><p>I&#039;m at a loss and don&#039;t know how to debug this problem.

					<p>Hello,<br />I have a general question about using usb audio on openwrt so sorry if I &quot;steal&quot; your topic a bit. I&#039;ve read several thread about installing usb audio card on openwrt but I&#039;m a bit confused about how to use it. If I understand correctly, I can play audio from a mounted hard disk on the openwrt. Is it also possible to play audio through the network ? for example from a WinXP or another linux host ?</p><p>thanks<br />Tex</p>									</div>

					<p>whbjr, if the product is not advrtised as having a C-Media chipset, the only way to find what it has is by running lsusb *after* you buy it! The links in your post show products that most likely do *not* have the C-Media chipset, irrespective of where they originate and whether the description has a &quot;3D&quot; label. I bought a similar one and had to go through the hoops to get it to work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>confused2008</strong> on 27 Feb 2008, 16:51)</p>

					<p>Well, then perhaps I was lucky (good luck, bad luck... you decide). I got a generically-exact one of those dongles, same &quot;3D SOUND&quot; label, same jacks, same LED, all that... and mine is:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># cat /proc/bus/usb/devices

					<p>Hi!</p><p>I tried mpd on my Asus WL-500Gp under 2.4 and 2.6 systems too. On 2.4 system i installed kmod-sound-core, and kmod-alsa, kmod-usb-audio not. Alsamixer started, and works, controls volume, etc. Mpd only works, if in mpd.conf file every three audio_ouput section remains commented. If i uncomment any of the two alsa section, the following error occured:</p><p>couldn&#039;t find audio output plugin for type &quot;alsa&quot; at line xx</p><p>If i uncomment the oss section, mpd starts without errors, i can edit playlists, etc., but can&#039;t play sounds.</p><p>On 2.6 system with only kmod-sound-core (kmod-alsa don&#039;t exists under 2.6), mpd never works. Alsamixer can&#039;t starts, following error occured:</p><p>function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device</p><p>Mpd with default mpd.conf, every three audio_output commented, don&#039;t starts, following error:</p><p>No audio_output specified and unable to detect a default audio output device</p><p>With any alsa output uncommented:</p><p>couldn&#039;t find audio output plugin for type &quot;alsa&quot; at line 88</p><p>With oss output, mpd started, but don&#039;t plays any sound, i can edit playlists, like on 2.4 system. Mpd only works under 2.6, if i installed kmod-usb-audio package too (which needs only oss support, described in: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbAudioHowto">http://wiki.openwrt.org/UsbAudioHowto</a> ) and in mpd.conf file oss section uncommented.</p><p>I&#039;m totally confused... How can i detect, which output used by mpd on 2.4 system, alsa or oss (emulation?)? Somebody can explain me how this works? Why can&#039;t use alsa output in the mpd.conf, under 2.4 and 2.6 too?</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
