					<p>Did you searched anything?<br />There are a lot of documentation explaining how to recover and with what files!<br />Take a look: <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a><br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=31729">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=31729</a></p><p>And about loading the mr-3020 firmware onto it, it seems posible, as it&#039;s the same hardware (same cpu, same ram, and same flash).<br />Flashing a different firmware can brick the device, but it will be still recoverable. As long you don&#039;t damage the bootloader, you can always flash any firmware over it and repair it.<br />Learn to recovery in the u-boot bootloader.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dabyd64</strong> on 16 Sep 2012, 03:59)</p>
