					<p>Hi,</p><p>Qualcomm has announced new processor catergory IPQ8064. Does OpenWRT support it? </p><p>I have seen some kernel patch for IPQ8064. So I wonder if ther is any development going on to support IPQ8064 in OpenWRT. </p><p>Any idea?</p><br /><br /><p>Thanks.<br />Tathagata</p>									</div>

					<p>The new processor was announced a while ago but consumer hardware is not listed.</p><p>For many SoCs there are lists at wikidevi:<br /><a href="https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Qualcomm_Atheros">https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Qualcomm_Atheros</a></p><p>If there is Kernel support then OpenWrt support might be possible (there are other factors like bootloader, wireless/network drivers that might make support difficult)<br />The developer board seems to be unnamed / not yet in kernel</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply.</p><p>I understand your point. But is it possible to add support of IPQ8064 in to OpenWRT? What are the things that one should keep in mind while adding support of IPQ8064 in OpenWRT?</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, I saw that.<br />QCA SDK is based on Linux-3.4 and the recent patch is based on Linux-3.15. So I couldn&#039;t match them. Any idea?</p><p>Do you know when OpenWRT officially supports Linux-3.15? Currently it supports up to 3.14.</p>									</div>
