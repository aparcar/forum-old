					<p>I have a Linksys WRT54G v3 router with Tomato firmware and a WRT54G v5 router with DD-WRT Micro firmware installed. Both have been running great. A friend recently gave me Linksys WRT54G router. It&#039;s another v5 so I realize its alternative firmware options are VERY limited.&nbsp; I know Tomato isn&#039;t an option &amp; I could flash DD-WRT micro on it like I did in the past, but I&#039;m seeing some things online about how an &#039;OpenWRT micro&#039; version might be available to install on it as well. </p><p>I searched and read some posts here about it, but they seem to be dated from way back in 2006. Is there a way to flash a micro version of OpenWRT on to my v5 Linksys? If so, where can I read about how to do it step-by-step?</p>									</div>

					<p>A while back, I actually managed to get OpenWRT running on a WRT54GS v7 (only 2MB of flash).&nbsp; You have to compile your own image to do it and you cannot use a jffs2 partition at all; everything has to be compiled statically into the image.</p>									</div>
