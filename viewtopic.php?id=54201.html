cmdftp - 0.9.7-1 - Features include passive mode for all data transfers, shell
 like transparent syntax for local and remote modes, multiple
 and recursive file transfers using wildcards, recursive copy and
 move commands, remote and local text file viewing and editing,
 network errors detection and resuming of currently executing
 command, partial download resuming (if server accepts REST
 command), tab completion for both local and remote names,
 autologin using classic ~/.netrc approach, large file support.

 cmdftp is aimed at being small and simple.</code></pre></div><p>HTH, HAND.</p>									</div>

 speed-limit.</code></pre></div><p>Edit: OK, I recognize that cmdftp is quite a bit smaller than wput, which could be and advantage on a 3020.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tmo26</strong> on 25 Nov 2014, 00:56)</p>
