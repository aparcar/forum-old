					<p>I have a MR3020 router that I want to tap as many GPIO&#039;s as I can and pass them outside of the router to be used for other things. My question is would I need to remove the led from the board before I can use the GPIO? </p><p>For example on the MR3020 the WLAN Led (Led 4) is on GPIO 0 connected thru Resistor R85. Could I leave the resistor/led alone and just tap off the GPIO location and read if the led is on or off from the outside world? ... or could I apply voltage from the outside world to the GPIO location (lighting the led) and also reading it&#039;s status from the router?</p>									</div>

					<p>In general, this should be possible without removing the resistor. But be sure, that you don&#039;t draw too much current (2 LEDs at the same time could be too much).</p>									</div>
