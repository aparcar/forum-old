					<p>I am using a function to check for a wireless connection and update &#039;wireless&#039; based on availability of a defined set of APs.&nbsp; While the function works as desired, it appears to somehow affect the routers ability to reboot using the LuCi Reboot function (System=&gt;Reboot).</p><p>I am hoping that someone can identify the issue and suggest a remedy.</p><p>The code was written by dabyd64 and is published here.&nbsp; <br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43352">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43352</a><br />I have made some mods and republished it here.<br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wifimgr-tool-to-automaticaly-select-an-apstation-from-a-list-of-saved-aps/#post-11953">http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wif â€¦ post-11953</a></p><p>I have tested the code on two devices and it seems to operate the same.&nbsp; Select the reboot function from LuCi and the page will sit for about 1 minute then return to the Status Overview Screen, not the Login.&nbsp; Logs confirm the system did not reboot.&nbsp; On occasion I will see &quot;daemon.info procd: - shutdown -&quot;, but not every reboot attempt; otherwise nothing remarkable.

					<p>seems your init script never finishes execution because it waits for wifiMgr.sh to finish ... which it never does. The whole thing looks pretty scabby but as a quick fix the &quot;&amp;&quot; should fix up your init script. Try this ..</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common

START=90
APP=wifiMgr.sh
ARGS=--daemon
PID_FILE=/var/run/$APP.pid

start() {

stop() {
        start-stop-daemon -K -n $APP -p $PID_FILE -s TERM
        rm -rf $PID_FILE
}</code></pre></div><p>This should allow the init script to exit properly and allow the LuCI reboot to function properly.Later this evening I will consider cleaning it up and adding a LuCI page for configuration and control so it can be controlled and configured using LuCI. </p><p>Cheers</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hostle19</strong> on 16 Feb 2016, 18:23)</p>

					<p>@hostle19, Thanks, that seems to have done the trick!</p><p>I see you reduced the priority to 90.&nbsp; Is there a reason for this?</p><p>I am not sure I will understand, but could you please direct me to info on or explain the parameters (-m -b &amp;).&nbsp; I was not able to construct a google that answered the question.</p><p>I am not qualified to comment on the quality of the code, but functionally it&#039;s the best thing I have found.</p><p>I am not sure what effort or direction you are contemplating here, but the single biggest issue with the function right now is the initial check occurring to early.&nbsp; I have attempted to fix this with &quot;PingSleep&quot;.

					<p>Hi,</p><p>start-stop-daemon has its roots in Debian.&nbsp; Man page (from Ubuntu) here for use, switches, etc:</p><p><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/start-stop-daemon.8.html">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/har â€¦ mon.8.html</a></p><p>Haven&#039;t run Debian in over 10 years now so I&#039;m no longer in practice.&nbsp; But...

					<p>I made a couple edits, I redid the init script to use the procd system since the start-stop daemon doesn&#039;t play nice with openwrt, and i also made a few changes to the wifiMgr.sh ..most notably I add a flag to your $PingSleep so it is only fired during initial boot, and I exchanged the network restarts for ifup and ifdowns should the entire network isn&#039;t nuked when a change is applied. I am not sure if this is exactly what you were after but it should give you the idea.

					<p>User error(s).... sorry<br />The code above was mis-typed while looking at a windows dialog box issued by the CLI component of WinSCP in response to /etc/init.d/wifiMgr enable (what a mouthful).</p><p>I have reformatted and uploaded the file and it seems to work.&nbsp; I did notice the first time I loaded it it was &quot;disabled&quot;, however it still showed that it ran in the logs.&nbsp; I enabled it and started it in System =&gt; Startup.&nbsp; Restart gave a &quot;Connection Reset&quot;, but after a reboot all now works fine.</p><p>I have not tested the core function yet.</p><p><strong>The need is for an automated Wifi Manager for a travel router.</strong>&nbsp; I should be able to use the device in known and unknown locations.&nbsp; In a known location it should auto scan and connect to an AP in the order that is specified in a list (automatically).&nbsp; In unknown locations I should be able to scan for an AP and connect (manually in LuCi).&nbsp; I should also be able to add this to the list for future use.</p><p>The functionality is pretty much like one sees on any laptop or wireless device.</p><p>The devil is always in the details.</p><p>The code was written by dabyd64 about 18 months ago for a similar, but different need.&nbsp; The big issue in OpenWrt land is the missing WWAN fails the WLAN.&nbsp; Was not an issue in the original need.</p><p>1 - The function periodically checks for a connection (ping test) and if a working connection is found sleeps for a period (default 1 minute).&nbsp; </p><p>2 - If no connection is found it then tests the configs in the list to see which is available.&nbsp; </p><p>3 - If it finds one, it then uses that info to update the wireless config.&nbsp; If not it disables the WWAN and returns to (1)</p><p>4 - After the config is updated it tests it again to make sure its really working.&nbsp; </p><p>5 - If it&#039;s working it goes to sleep and returns to (1).&nbsp; If it&#039;s not working it goes back to the list (2) and continues where it left off</p><p>I do not fully understand all the code, like around line 31 #Sometimes it shows nothing.....</p><p>There is a check at line 70 which the author limited the list of saved APs to 99.&nbsp; Don&#039;t care really.&nbsp; I could see with a save AP feature that the list could get long, but that&#039;s more of a maintenance issue.&nbsp; Not sure how long it takes to check an AP.&nbsp; Ping time x number of checks x number of APs =???</p><p>I added the process to disable the existing STA in step 3 before continuing, as with out this there is NO access to the WLAN (a basic issue) and there are legit times that this will occur (car, plane, etc).&nbsp; There probably should be a check up front of the status for the condition of the device already having a disabled WWAN in which case it is not disabled again.&nbsp; </p><p>I added the PingSleep to address the issue about the network starting.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have kept increasing this value, trying to find the value that gets the network running before a scan, but it&#039;s still not reliable.&nbsp; It really should be tied to an event or status of the networking.&nbsp; This is a small irritant in the function.&nbsp; </p><p>I am not married to the logic or tools used.&nbsp; </p><p>For example there are two sections of code to check for a connection.&nbsp; One up front and the other right after a change.&nbsp; I expect they could be a single function called twice.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that there may be a better way to check for a network connection than ping.&nbsp; </p><p>You asked about the wifi-iface naming.&nbsp; I chose wifi-iface[1] because to manually change APs in Luci I find I have to delete the STA and then add a new one by unchecking the box.&nbsp; If I do not do it this way the existing configs are replaced.&nbsp; When you delete the STA, it moves the Master up to the first location.&nbsp; If we assume we will use this tool to manually add a new STAtion (current method) and that we will not want to change our WLAN side connection, then this made the tool much more reliable as the Master should not go away (the original code was wifi-iface[0]).&nbsp; &nbsp;I think calling the element by STA as opposed to iface would be better, though not sure it&#039;s possible.&nbsp; It also might better support multiple radios (I use a 2nd USB radio in one device, not tested it yet) though not a big concern&nbsp; The goal, in part, is to fix the issue that drove me to 2 radios.</p><p>The adding of a new manual station also drove the BSSID fix (delete).&nbsp; The function does not use BSSID, and it appears (good/bad/right/wrong) that it&#039;s not absolutely needed, but is added in a manual add of an AP.&nbsp; I believe there are six elements that are required to define the iface,.&nbsp; The function only uses some, i added at BSSID and the not fully required Status.&nbsp; I am not clear what good practice suggests.&nbsp; </p><p>A LuCi GUI would be real nice.&nbsp; The level of sophistication is up to you.&nbsp; I would see a form with 2 sections.&nbsp; One for STAtion management and another for operating parameters.&nbsp; The operating parameters I think are straight forward.&nbsp; As for station management, there are numerous approaches, but it&#039;s basically a list and a form I think.&nbsp; If the form had a button that could populate the existing station that would be great.&nbsp; </p><p>Hope I have not scared you off.&nbsp; The function really seems to work pretty good in practice, but can be improved.&nbsp; The ability to add a STAtion, even manually, inside of Luci would be great.&nbsp; Anything you are willing to do is appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am not sure what you mean by new function ?&nbsp; Regardless, I have pretty well redone the whole deal in lua, the necessary functions are complete, and I have created a LuCI interface to set the general config settings and add networks.
