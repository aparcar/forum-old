					<p>Wlan interface names are not predictable, therfore you cannot reference them directly in the network config. For example if you work with dynamic wifi vlans or with wds station mode you have a wlan0 and a lot of wlan0.staX which need to be added and removed at runtime, you cannot write those all into /etc/config/network.</p>									</div>
