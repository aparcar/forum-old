					<p>Now I&#039;m completely new to this but I like a challenge.<br />Got a DIR-615 that I like to replace.<br />OpenWRT is the optional choice of an upgrade but what about the hardware?<br />It should funcion as an ordinary gome router so doesn&#039;t have many requirements.</p><p>Is there anything obvious that can be recommended for a newcomer who&#039;s up for a challenge?</p>									</div>

					<p>Linksys is known to be one of the most widely supported open wrt routers. I have had good luck with my Linksys WRT1900ACS. You can pick one of these up for a little over $100 refurbished.</p><p>And for $79 the Linksys WRT AC1200 almost can&#039;t be beat and is designed for OpenWRT/DD-WRT due to it&#039;s dual partition feature which flashes openwrt into a separate partition, enabling you to go back to the original Linksys firmware if something goes wrong.</p><p>Can&#039;t post links, so just search Amazon for the Linksys WRT 1200AC.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aweir14150</strong> on 23 Apr 2017, 03:23)</p>

It seems to support 5Ghz wifi as well.<br />Will see how this all works out.</p>									</div>

					<p>In that price range (only slightly above), IPQ40xx might be another contender (but that requires fresh LEDE snapshots for the time being) with more reliable wlan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to round up this topic: Thanks for all suggestions!</p><p>I browsed the device pages and table of hardware (very helpful!) and eventually decided for a Netgear R6250.<br />It seems to be a good compromise between cost and OpenWRT compatibility and available capabilities with OpenWRT.</p><p>Now looking forward to installing the system <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Stephan</p>									</div>
