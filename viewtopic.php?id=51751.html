					<p>Good morning,<br />Yesterday I was setting up the local iptables in my home server:<br />I setup a NAT on my openwrt router.<br />Then I setup a MAC whitelist on the local iptables of the server writing the MAC&#039;s from the devices I want to connect to the server (I&#039;ve access to that devices).<br />But the connections were dropped displaying a unknown MAC...<br />Looking in the openwrt router I saw that that &quot;unknown&quot; MAC address was the&nbsp; the route!</p><p>So the openwrt firewall is masquerading/spoofing/overwriting/replacing (whatever) the incoming mac addresses by its own MAC...<br />I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s the normal working method in openwrt but, this is not as the normal routers works ¬¬&#039;</p><p>One additional note, the IP address is NOT being masquerading!</p><p>Someone can tell me if this is normal and how can I setup the router to not overwrite the incoming MAC addresses?</p>									</div>

					<p>MAC addresses are always just link local. As soon as a router forwards (as in layer 3 routing) traffic it will re-send the received etherent frames with its own MAC as source, completely normal procedure for ethernet routers.</p><p>Sounds to me like you want a bridge, that operates on layer 2 and &quot;preserves&quot; the mac address. Note however that MACs do not &quot;travel over the internet&quot;, all you&#039;d get then would be the MAC addresses of your upstream ISP routers and switches.</p>									</div>
