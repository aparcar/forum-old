					<p>I&#039;ve decided to migrate my router-firewall WHR-HP-G300N from DD-WRT to OpenWrt (its &quot;professional firmware&quot; a.k.a DD-WRT hasn&#039;t been updated in ages, and I&#039;ve encountered enough bugs already).<br />I can see it&#039;s supported and the Wiki gives me &quot;openwrt-ar71xx-generic-whr-hp-g300n-squashfs-factory.bin&quot; as the image to start with. Does this image contain a web interface or is it telnet/SSH login only? Just want to make sure to have all files ready before starting the process.<br />The Wiki also says I can safely use the device&#039;s DD-WRT web interface firmware upgrade page to do this. So there&#039;s really no prior hard reset (30 seconds and such) and re-flash with some blank image required (which sounds great, as long as no left-overs from previous installations/images/settings/partitions remain on the device)?</p>									</div>

					<p>Case closed, apparently when I added that very Static Lease back at a later time, there was no problem anymore. It might have something to do with the fact that I had added the Static Lease in another 192.168.x.y range when the router still had its default 192.168.1.1 IP address.</p>									</div>
