					<p>Using journal force the device to write twice the data. <br />The 1st at the journal area then 2nd from journal to the storage area.<br />All this over the very bottlenecked usb bus.</p><p>If you try using ext2 the write speed must be better.</p><p>Another complain is that the journal area will be suffer from wearing ( flash memory ) in a very fast way.</p>									</div>

					<p>@spy00a35:<br />I am very impressed with your 10MB/s write speeds!<br />Could you give some background information on your setup and configuration?</p><p>Because I only get about half the speed, but will perform some testing and post the results.</p>									</div>

					<p>My setup is a WR703N router (very similar to MR3020), and a 32ÂµSD connected via a USB3 card reader and a USB2.0 hub to the router. <br />Connecting the hub to a PC instead gives 12MB/s write speed and 26MB/s reading speed when accessing the first partition of the stick, which is fat32 formatted.</p><p>Here are my speed measurements when the transfering data to / from the router:<br />Setup:<br />-router is running on extroot (2nd partition on stick with ext4)<br />-lots of packages installed, so I stopped the mpd and cupsd process, which consume quite a lot of resources.</p><p>before writing data to router:<br />-running &quot;top&quot; showed the following CPU usage:<br />0% usr 0% sys 0% nic 98% idle 0% io 0% irg 0% sirq<br />-web interface Status - Realtime graph - Load showed ~.1</p><p>reading data from fat:<br />10% usr 70% sys 3% io 25% sirq<br />Load 2.9<br />speed 9 MB/s</p><p>uploading data to fat (via Filezilla over FTP):<br />10% usr 30% sys 60% io 15 % sirq<br />Load &gt; 1.4<br />speed ~5 MB/s<br />BUT when uploading a big file, the FTP connection to the router is repeatedly lost. Despite being unresponsive to the web interface, SSH and FTP, internet access still works.</p><p>So I am really interested in your setup, how you were able to write big files with high data rates and no aborts.</p>									</div>

					<p>When I run transmission, my system always was very slow, unresponsive or even crashed. So I am going to use rtorrent instead which seems to use a lot less CPU resources.</p><p>My partitions are the same, only the order is different: 1st FAT (to be accessable when used on a Windows PC), 2nd Ext4 as extroot, 3rd Swap</p><p>Regarding FTP transfer: My system seems to crash only for upload sessions. Downloads work fine, with over 10MB/s.<br />And indeed, transfering data to /from ext4 is really slow, aroung 3MB/s.</p>									</div>
