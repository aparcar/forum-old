					<p>Hi arokh,</p><p>Thanks a lot for this build.<br />I tried to install it in my WNDRMacv2 and so far it is working fine. But I install the OpenWRT because I want to use OpenVPN client in my router to connect to the remote OpenVPN server. But I don&#039;t know how to get it worked. So far what I have done:<br />1. Edited the /etc/config/openvpn to disable the default one.<br />2. Disabled the OpenVPN.<br />3. Added a new entry in this config file for my VPN.<br />4. Started the OpenVPN. Sometimes I got an error like this: &quot;Unroutable control packet received from&quot;, however after several tries, the OpenVPN seemed to connect. But after connection, I cannot access the Internet anyway. I can ping 8.8.8.8 from the router, so I guess there is something wrong with the firewall. But I didn&#039;t how to config this to this build. Could you kindly help me to figure out this?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Arokh, I am sorry for asking this again, though since you didn&#039;t respond on my posts I thought you might have missed them, if you did read them consider this post deleted (I will delete it if you want me to). I just wanted to politely ask you because there is just one thing that is really important to me and will make this FW perfect for my use again. I wanted to PM you, but you have (probably for good reason <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> ) disabled that on your profile, hence me just doing one more post on it.</p><p>I love your FW and am very grateful for your efforts on it, especially now you have implemented OpenVPN out of the box this is my FW to go to.<br />I know I asked for unfs being added to the package and in my previous posts I asked for you to change or take it out again, I hope this didn&#039;t come to you as ungrateful and was the reason for you to ignore my posts as that is the last thing I am or wanted it to imply!</p><p>I use NFS mainly for my media players and NFS now doesn&#039;t work in my case (may it be due to my incompetence to add it to rc.local, I just can&#039;t get it to work without manually starting the services, or something else) after a reboot and that is the only thing for me (and I would guess others that use NFS with a permanent connected USB storage device) that doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>Again, I hope you do not take this as whining or anything like it, it is the opposite of that <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I just ordered a wndr3800, as my g300nh is too slow for qos with my fiber 75/75 on openwrt or gargoyle.</p><p>I&#039;m so glad you can overclock these routers!&nbsp; But, how does it compare to the ceroWRT builds?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read that openwrt is pretty much caught up to cero, what do you think, have you compared them?</p><p>Also, do you think you can explain how to modify the u-boot to overclock, in case I use gargoyle or ceroWRT instead?&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find anything individual, it seems like it has to be done altogether with the firmware?</p><p>Thanks a lot and I look forward to experimenting with this faster router!</p><p>I will share my blocklist scripts once I have the wndr3800 set up.&nbsp; For now, I have it this way:<br /><a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=5839">http://www.gargoyle-router.com/phpbb/vi … amp;t=5839</a></p>									</div>
