					<p>I have installed the package xmail for its pop3 and smtp capabilities.<br />I can connect from a pop3 client to send an email which is accepted by the server.<br />However the email is never delivered to destination as it remains in the rsnd subdirectory of the spool directory. Same from mails coming from external smtp servers which remains in one of the random rsnd subdirectory in the spool and is never delivered to the Maildior storage.<br />Even running in debug mode no error is signalled.<br />Any idea?<br />Thanks<br />smtp log extract<br />&quot;home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;::ffff:192.168.10.58&quot;&nbsp; &quot;2011-0<br />7-30 15:45:25&quot;&nbsp; &quot;QUADCORE&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;space.it&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;g@home.xxx.org&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;g.xxx@space.it&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;S25&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;RCPT=OK&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&quot;<br />&quot;home.gallinaro.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;::ffff:192.168.10.58&quot;&nbsp; &quot;2011-0<br />7-30 15:45:25&quot;&nbsp; &quot;QUADCORE&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;space.it&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;g@home.xxx.org&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;g.xxx@space.it&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;S25&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;RECV=OK&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;2467&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&quot;<br />&quot;home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;::ffff:157.55.1.177&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;2011-0<br />7-30 15:58:41&quot;&nbsp; &quot;dub0-omc2-s38.dub0.hotmail.com&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;home.xxx.org&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;g.xxx@hotmail.com&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;g@home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;S26&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;RCPT=OK&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;0&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&quot;<br />&quot;home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;home.xxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;::ffff:157.55.1.177&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;2011-0<br />7-30 15:58:41&quot;&nbsp; &quot;dub0-omc2-s38.dub0.hotmail.com&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;home.xxx.org&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;g.xxx@hotmail.com&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;g@home.xxxx.org&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;S26&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;RECV=OK&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;1241&quot;&nbsp; &quot;&quot;</p>									</div>
