					<p>I am trying to convince my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v2 to use VLAN7 tagging on the WAN port. (Required for German Telekom BNG access).</p><p>The modem I&#039;m using is an Allnet ALL0333CJ Rev.7. This used to work fine until Telekom switched my access to BNG, so I understand I now need to enable VLAN tagging as already mentioned.</p><p>So in /etc/config/network I did:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;wan&#039;
-    option ifname &#039;eth0&#039;
+    option ifname &#039;eth0.7&#039;
    option proto &#039;pppoe&#039;
    option username &#039;xxxxxx@t-online.de&#039;
    option password &#039;xxxxxx&#039;

....

config switch_vlan
    option device &#039;switch0&#039;
-    option vlan &#039;2&#039;    
-    option vid &#039;2&#039;
-    option ports &#039;5 6&#039;     
+    option vlan &#039;7&#039;
+    option vid &#039;7&#039;
+    option ports &#039;5 6t&#039;</code></pre></div><p>I don&#039;t really know how to check if tagging is actually taking place, but at least I don&#039;t get a working internet connection so I am assuming it&#039;s not.</p><p>Has anybody managed to get this working? This howto: <a href="https://www.computerhilfen.de/hilfen-22-389919-0.html">https://www.computerhilfen.de/hilfen-22-389919-0.html</a> (sorry, it&#039;s german) claims to make it work but for the v1 which has a slightly different port layout.</p><p>Any hints would be greatly appreciated...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>EDIT: One thing I forgot to mention: Here is the Technical Specification document that states that VLAN7 is required: <a href="https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/downloads/1tr112.zip">https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/downloads/1tr112.zip</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>edr</strong> on 15 Sep 2017, 00:31)</p>

This works perfectly. I read your post on the cell phone while going to bed after hours of fiddling, then booted up the computer again to give it one last try and now I am writing this reply through a connected router!</p><p>Thank you very, very much, you really made my day!!!</p>									</div>
