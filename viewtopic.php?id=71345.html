					<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m using Chaos Calmer 15.05.1 on my Zyxel P2812HNU-F1 device. It&#039;s running nicely, but I&#039;d like to upgrade to the bleeding edge Designated Driver.</p><p>Try as I might, I can&#039;t seem to be able to build a P2812HNU-F1 image by using the Lantiq/xrx200/default profile combo. In a recent commit by John Crispin, the &#039;remaining legacy targets&#039; were converted to a new image generation format, in which a &#039;LegacyDevice&#039; prefix was added to their device definitions in target/linux/lantiq/image/Makefile.</p><p>I can&#039;t seem to find a suitable switch anywhere from &#039;make menuconfig&#039; so I could build these legacy targets. If I choose the aforementioned combo, I get the image files of those devices which have the &#039;Device&#039; prefix, but I do not get any files for those devices with the &#039;LegacyDevice&#039; prefix.</p><p>Any hints on what I can do to fix this, other than blatantly changing the F1 image&#039;s prefix?</p>									</div>
