					<p>Hello, I am a novice in linux command line and networking. I have two PCs, one printer and a Raspberry PI download plus NAS box in my local network, all connected to a TP-Link WR1043ND running Attitude Adjustment. The internet connection I am going to switch over to will connect me in wireless LAN mode. This is going to cause security issues because I will need to connect the cable in one of the four LAN ports. I need help in configuring the router so that one LAN port will behave like a WAN port when it comes to security. I also need some sort of cheap or free VPN whose client can be installed inside OpenWRT.</p><p>I seriously need your help; the switching is happening within this week and I need all security issues cleared before I switch.</p><p>Here is /etc/config/network:</p><p>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;lo&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;127.0.0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.0.0.0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</p><p>config interface &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_ifname &#039;eth0.2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option _orig_bridge &#039;false&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option password &#039;******&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option service &#039;BSNL&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option peerdns &#039;0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option username &#039;************&#039;</p><p>config switch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option reset &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option enable_vlan &#039;1&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;1 2 3 4 5t&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0 5t&#039;</p><p>Also, can anyone help me configure WAN port as LAN so that I will have one LAN port free for connecting another device in future?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sbcontt</strong> on 14 Feb 2013, 13:08)</p>

					<p>So you want another port to act the same as WAN port?</p><p>Do something like this</p><p>config interface &#039;wan2&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.3&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ....</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;2 3 4 5t&#039;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;rtl8366rb&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;3&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;1 5t&#039;</p><p>You create another VLAN, with ports 1 and 5, remove port 1 from VLAN1. This will make switch port 1 (this might be physically labeled port 4 on the box) act as a separate port. You will also need to add &#039;wan2&#039; interface to wan zone on the firewall.</p>									</div>

					<p>No not WAN. The ethernet cable from the media converter is supposed to be connected directly to the NIC of a PC. So connecting it to a WAN port should not work. I just need to place one LAN port in a separate zone from other LAN ports, and apply firewall in-between the two zones.</p>									</div>

					<p>My issue has been solved in another forum. You could have said that WAN mode is not exclusive for connecting to modems. I do not know how Wide Arean Network works but had previously tried by setting WAN in DHCP client mode just like what I do for connecting a PC to a modem that is in PPPoE mode, but for whatever reason that does not work.</p><p>This time I manually set up IP addresses for all interfaces from within LuCI and things are working now.</p>									</div>

					<p>WAN port is the same as any other ethernet port on the router...it can be connected to a switch, (xDSL) modem, FTTH media converter or whatever... The WAN designation is regarding the firewall on the router itself.<br />I&#039;m sorry if my answer was not helpful, but your question was not very clear as well. You have asked: &quot;I need help in configuring the router so that one LAN port will behave like a WAN port when it comes to security.&quot; and that was the answer I provided. Of course, if your WAN port is not connected at the momemnt, you can use that, no need for configuring a separate LAN port.</p>									</div>

					<p>@gulikoza,</p><p>your solution is appreciated and i believed is better. i found it much better for the port would surely be separated from the lan and have a different network. your help is not wasted and your post is a good reference for networking guys. somehow he managed to solved his problem simpler but still not fully secured for they are still in the same network.</p>									</div>
