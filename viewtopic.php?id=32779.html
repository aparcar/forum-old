					<p>You can setup something similar with any mini-itx-board. <br />e.g. <a href="http://pden.zotac.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage_images.tpl&amp;product_id=322&amp;category_id=95&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=1">http://pden.zotac.com/index.php?page=sh … p;Itemid=1</a> </p><p>You get 2 mini-pci-e-slots, 1 pci-e (where you can add another gigabit-card) and that for just 90euros. with a case with external powersupply and an additional networkcard it will cost you 150euro.</p>									</div>
