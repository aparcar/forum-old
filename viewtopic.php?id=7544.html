					<p>I hope I can help you. But first three thinks;<br />I’m not an expert, second; I sniff on a WRT which is in Bridge-Mode, third; the kernel drops a lot of packets.</p><p>My setup; I use two WRT’s, one as router the other as bridge (pointing to the neighbor’s AP, he is sharing his DSL to me). The router routes all my Internet requests to the neighbor’s router over my bridge. In my case, the bridge is the last instance of my network; therefore I take sniff-samples from there.</p><p>I use two ways to sniff</p><p>1. I login via ssh and do<br />tcpdump -Al -vvv -s 1516 -i eth1</p><p>where -A is ASCII-output, -l is line buffered, -vvv is much verbose, -s 1516 is to see the payload and -i eth1 is the Wlan-Interface</p><p>If I abort tcpdump, it stops with following:<br />315 packets captured<br />1783 packets received by filter<br />1119 packets dropped by kernel</p><p>As you can see, nearly 50% is lost. Maybe the CPU is to slow?!</p><p>2. I have a sh-script on my powerbook, which I use to trigger to start the sniffing:<br />#!/bin/sh</p><p>ssh root@192.168.0.100 /usr/sbin/tcpdump -Al -vvv -s 1516 -i eth1 &gt; /Users/admin/Desktop/fullbridge.log</p><p>Here I use the same options. The advantage to use this script is, that I save the sniff direct on my powerbook and I can look at it in real-time with the application console, which affords me to filter the entire sniff also in real-time.</p>									</div>

					<p>No I did not. How to do this?</p><p>On the bridge is also kismet installed, but I don’t use this, because I don’t know to handle it (yet).

					<p>@Setsquare<br />Hi, thanks for this advise. Can you confirm, that you have no packets dropped by the Kernel, when you use the option -vvv and -s 1500 (read the entire payload)?<br />If so, then it is worth to troubleshooting this on my side, later.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mortem</strong> on 2 Oct 2006, 19:12)</p>

					<p>@yanky, thanks that you did the test for me. To see payload the only option is -s 1500 or bigger (1500 is the package size (MTU), for tcp/ip = 1500). I don&#039;t get something like &quot;PRIVACY&quot;, but I did not to try to get into the Monitor-Mode. I think is no need for that, because you are not wardriving (monitor-mode = be silent in the network (I think)). You&#039;re nic should be in PROMISC-mode, thats happen automatic, when you start tcpdump. But maybe I&#039;m wrong...</p><p>@strider22, I don&#039;t know what went wrong. I have no Filter set and of course I &quot;drop&quot; all Internet packets into the neighbour&#039;s subnet. The wrt is in Bridge-Mode and the interface I sniff has no IP assigned, maybe this is the reason. I can&#039;t/want troubleshooting this at this time, because: never touch a running system, I have no fallback and if something goes wrong: no Internet = no Information...</p>									</div>
