					<p>I&#039;ve used other DLP USB devices and those have worked quite well. That being said, I did modify the picocom source code so that I could issue batch mode commands and record temperature, voltage etc.&nbsp; and I might have made some changes to get it to work (it&#039;s been a year and a half since I did that). I&#039;&#039;ll try to find that and repost. <br />Meanwhile do you have the kmod-usb-serial-ftdi package installed. <br />And are you running the linux 2.6 version of kamikaze or the 2.4 version ?</p>									</div>

					<p>Sir, you indeed solved my problem.&nbsp; </p><p>I am running 2.4.&nbsp; I had configured<br />the generic serial module to grab the DLP device.<br />I didn&#039;t have kmod-usb-serial-ftdi installed.&nbsp; I installed it<br />and edited /etc/modules.d/65-usb-serial-ftdi so that it<br />contains the following single line:</p><p>ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0x6001</p><p>(where the vendor and product numbers come<br />from lsusb).&nbsp; The device now appears to work<br />fine.</p><p>By the way, I know you know this, I am writing<br />this stuff for any fellow hobbyists who are as misguided<br />as I am.</p><p>In conclusion, the modules I installed are:</p><p>usbutils (for lsusb)<br />kmod-usb-core (probably preinstalled by kamikaze, but I am not sure)<br />kmod-usbserial<br />kmod-uhci<br />kmod-ohci (I don&#039;t think this is needed)<br />kmod-usb-serial-ftdi</p><p>and remember to edit /etc/modules.d/*-usb-serial-ftdi.</p><p>Thanks much!</p>									</div>

					<p>Snowyowlster, or anybody else with experience with the DLP devices:</p><p>I have a DLP-TEMP-G (USB thermometer) which works by emulating a TTY.<br />When I send it a byte with the ASCII code for &quot;S&quot; it returns 9 bytes, with the<br />first two containing the temperature.</p><p>Except it doesn&#039;t always return 9 bytes, so my simple-minded microperl<br />program, which tries to read 9 bytes at a time, hangs.</p><p>I tried using &quot;select&quot; for non-blocking reads, but microperl doesn&#039;t implement<br />select.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Does anybody have other clever suggestions?&nbsp; I am just<br />thinking I&#039;ll have to write this code in C.&nbsp; Which is unfortunate because I<br />am not cross-compiling and didn&#039;t want to set that up.</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>
