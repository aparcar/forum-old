					<p>I do not have build toolchain (yet, looks like I will need it since all build kamikaze stuff are available only at <a href="http://flyashi.dyndns.org:81">http://flyashi.dyndns.org:81</a> - thanks to Yasha) and I even lazy and brave enough to setup openwrt via netgears web interface. I should report - it works exactly as it should. I did not bothered about wireless, but what I am really do care at the point - is bluetooth, and looks like I can not find hci_usb module anywhere, I assume it should be in kmod-bluetooth. Am I wrong or it is a matter of few minutes fix? Thanks in advance.</p><p>alecs</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks to Yasha who supplied us with those compiled Kamikaze I have updated modules once in a while and have bluetooth fixed and it works the way it should. Thanks again. I am really sad to hear you are closing your compilations and it could be, although should not be, for good. Since if people brave (that is me ;-)) or stupid enough to go with experimental setup... Well they are on their own. But as I said - it should not be - because more people using it - more feedback you get and of course simple questions will prevail.</p><p>But turning to the bright side - thanks to Yasha again - <a href="http://openwrt.pbwiki.com">http://openwrt.pbwiki.com</a>/ - this is what we struggling users/testers of WGT634U/Kamikaze really need. It is not a secret that WhiteRussian does not work on Netgear thus all owners of it _forced_ to use Kamikaze (same owners know what quality is original firmware - so they are already on the razorz edge;-)). I wish there will be more people/devs willing to fill in gaps of this wiki. Thanks for great help.</p><p>alecs</p>									</div>
