But the problem is, device 2 is very limited device. So i removed several services.<br />Btw. i tried to expand my wpa 2 enterprise coverage with bridging this 2 devices but it seems wpa 2 enterprise can not be used in bridged mode. Is it possible ? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>My dhcp is located at pfsense i want to manage everything on pfsense side. I can try to create a new dhcp range and provide it via device 2 but as i mentioned above, because of the bridged interface its a question for me.</p><p>I thought i can solve it via vlans but i didn&#039;t find a right configuration for it also ..</p>									</div>

					<p>I assume you want to use the wireless connection between your OpenWrt routers as a VLAN trunk. You can&#039;t transfer VLAN tags over Wi-Fi, as they are specific to Ethernet, and wireless interfaces aren&#039;t aware of them. You&#039;ll need to create one SSID per VLAN you wish to configure, and then bridge each SSID (and client interface on STA device) to its corresponding eth0.X interface. You will also need to configure forwarding for each SSID, whether you are using relayd, NAT or something else (i.e. one relay bridge interface per SSID, if you&#039;re using relayd).</p>									</div>

					<p>Well it seems i found the problem.<br />First of all i solve the ip range problem via strictly redefining my ranges.</p><p>But, the most important touch is changing vlan 20 to 12 on both sides <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />It seems my openwrt box not supports vlan id bigger than ~16</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Perhaps I was unclear the Nanostation M2 units I&#039;m using are not also the Access Points. I&#039;m using them as dedicated bridge devices on a hidden SSID and have access points plugged into them on each end. There is no configuration for the Nanostation units to share of note, simply a bridge between the wired and wireless interfaces. The OpenWRT devices look for tagged traffic coming in the port attached to the Nanostation and are then configured just as if the device was plugged into a wired trunk.</p>									</div>
