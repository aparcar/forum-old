					<p>I&#039;ve got two virtualbox instances running the x86 version of 14.07 with strongswan-default installed. I&#039;ve opened up the proper ports on both instances by running:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -I INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 4500 -j ACCEPT</code></pre></div><p>And I&#039;ve got the following in my ipsec.conf:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>conn %default

I&#039;m able to boot up Knoppix on the internal network behind each OpenWRT instance and both connect through to the internet fine.</p><p>I&#039;m also able to get the two instances to establish a VPN tunnel between them which holds up fine. I can even ping across the tunnel from one router to the other, infact I can ping from a Knopping instance on the 192.168.129.0/24 subnet, through it&#039;s OpenWRT instance, through the tunnel to the opposite instance at it&#039;s br-lan address 192.168.130.1, and it works fine. The problem is, I can&#039;t ping anything behind the remote OpenWRT instance.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried making static routes that point to the lan br_lan interface, again static routes that point to the wan interface, I tried it without any static routes at all... so the traffic is passing through the tunnel, but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m having a routing issue or a firewall issue.</p><p>Do anyone have any advice or have something like this working?</p><p>The goal is to eventually terminate a strongswan tunnel from an Amazon EC2 instance to my OpenWRT router. Right now this tunnel exists, but it&#039;s coming back into to a linux VM with the proper ports forwarded through and I&#039;d like to move it up to the OpenWRT router, but when I tried that yesterday, I got the tunnel to establish and I was able to initiate traffic (ping) from Amazon EC2 into my local LAN, but nothing form the LAN out to Amazon EC2 worked... again, I&#039;m not sure if it was routing or firewall rules.</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>Just another update, I was able to use to the &quot;forceencaps=yes&quot; directive to get the tunnel to come up between OpenWRT and a Cisco ASA5520 and again, traffic is one way. I can ping from the remote network behind the ASA into my local LAN behind the OpenWRT router, even more some pretty large files around as well. But again, I can not initiate traffic from the local LAN behind the OpenWRT out to the remote subnet. It still appears that the traffic isn&#039;t entering the tunnel as I don&#039;t see traffic counters moving nor I am able to see drop messages of any kind in the Cisco logs.</p><p>Performance was a little slow as well, but I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s due to the power of the router. I&#039;m able to move files at about 10MB per second, which is about right give that I have a 75Mbps link to the internet from home when I&#039;m going through my linux VM VPN appliance, but when I move the tunnel over to the OpenWRT on an ASUS N56U, performance drops to about 2 - 3M or what seems to be about 16 - 20Mbps, I also see the load average on OpenWRT going up to around 1.85 - 2.0.</p><p>For larger environments I may stick with the linux VM, but for a few remote locations I&#039;m only looking to move some web traffic and maybe some VoIP traffic, maybe for 1 - 5Mbps max which should be fine.</p>									</div>
