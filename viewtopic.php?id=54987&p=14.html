					<p><strong>@yogibear and @unmesh</strong>, thanks for the tip about Padavan firmware ...it has daily builds and working on my Xioami finally perfectly. So far no issues at all including those I have described above. Performance is great, signals are strong, no dropouts...simply excellent finally. (greatest would be Openwrt but who knows when it will get fixed).</p><p>For some of you, if interested , search for 4PDA and Padavan (not sure if it&#039;s allowed to post links to such sites directly...). There is even included some EPPROM &quot;tuning&quot; for 5GHz.....</p><p>Daily builds : <a href="https://routerclub.ru/upload/padavan/nightly/">https://routerclub.ru/upload/padavan/nightly/</a> (located under xrm_base folder)</p><p>Commits: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u/commits/branch/master">https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u/c … nch/master</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sharkys</strong> on 19 Mar 2016, 18:00)</p>

					<p>@unmesh: Yep, that&#039;s right. Breed is the same side on a different coin. Somehow I could switch back to u-boot, I guess, but for now the whole device is no option to me. I just gave it a try and in the end I was lucky to have it installed, because OpenWrt trunk nearly bricked my device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve got a brand new router still in the box.....I&#039;ve read through the thread and several other sites talking about the router and alternate firmware...found alot of 404 web pages and have seen that some of the firmwares have various issues including a weak signal on some bands...since I&#039;m coming into this clean I&#039;d like to know if I can install the breed bootloader FIRST so as to bypass the possibility of bricking my router?&nbsp; &nbsp;Also as of today what is the recommended firmware that has the least issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d LIKE to be able to hook up my ZTE hotspot device via usb and I believe I read the only one supporting this was the &quot;CC&quot; build....of openwrt?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>I&#039;ve downloaded the latest breed bootloader but can&#039;t find any actual installation instructions...just various people saying &quot;oh you should use this...&quot;....</p><p>Anyone know which firmware&#039;s do NOT support acting as a wifi bridge?&nbsp; I&#039;d need this feature if it didn&#039;t support the usb connection.</p><p>I did read the 03/19 post but nothing covered breed and things seem to be changing DAILY so thought I&#039;d start off on the right foot.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>famewolf</strong> on 26 Mar 2016, 08:16)</p>
