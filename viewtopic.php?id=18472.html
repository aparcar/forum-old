					<p>Hi,<br />I was unable to route properly as I wanted to nat multiple gateways through 1:1 natting and src routing. Configuration etc ws not a problem but i failed to do it.&nbsp; The hardware is wpe53g on stock firmare it has routing mode. So I guess it supports routing. The lan was eth and wan was ath0 and I was connected to eth0</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PC.............eth0:wpe53g:ath0........router</p><p>Strangely I was able to ping the ath ip address without any natting rules or adding any routes. The firewall is disabled even the modules of iptables is removed but still i was able to ping the ath0. With tcpdump on ath0 I could see broadcast from ethernet side which should not come as its running in routing mode and no bridging is there. Could be a bug or the hw is not supporting it.<br />regards<br />norms</p>									</div>
