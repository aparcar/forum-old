					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I have a &quot;special&quot; box from a french ISP (ovh) that can aggregate many DSL lines..<br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t find any resource in english about the product but here is the product description <span class="bbu">ovhtelecom.fr/overthebox/</span></p><p>In fact the product is just a regular PC (in this case a NUC de3815tykhe) with a custom OpenWrt distribution associated to a subscription to their service that aggregate the lines.</p><p>Luckily their distribution is open source (here is the github repo <span class="bbu">github.com/ovh/overthebox</span> ) and it is possible to install their distribution to a regular PC (my next goal is to install it on a VM on a bare metal server using proxmox).</p><p>So, since the NUC should run 24/7 and it has a USB 3.0 port I just wanted to use it also as a NAS.<br />I connected a USB disk storage and I managed to mount the disk...<br />But this is all I can do <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I&#039;m unable to install samba !<br />Since its a modified version of OpenWrt I don&#039;t have the <em>services</em> tab and I don&#039;t have access to the <em>network shares</em> options... So I&#039;m unable to follow this guide <span class="bbu">wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/usb-storage-samba-webinterface</span><br />And when I tried with the following method <span class="bbu">wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/cifs.server</span> it appears that I don&#039;t have the samba server installed but neither it is availbale with the opkg tool.</p><p>When I try an update of the dpkg tool, it seems that the only source used is the following ones <span class="bbu">downloads.overthebox.ovh/stable/x86/64/packages/</span><br />In this &quot;repo&quot; under the <em>base </em>directory there is only the <em>samba-client</em> package and there is nothing related to samba and LuCI under the <em>luci </em>directory..</p><p>So, how can I turn on the samba service ?</p><p>Thank you very much (and sorry for my bad english and for the links I&#039;m unable to link)</p><p>Edit: I have ssh access, so I can run commands and give more information if needed..<br />Meantime, here is the output of </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /proc/version</code></pre></div><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Linux version 3.18.20 (overthebox@compile) (gcc version 4.8.3 (OpenWrt/Linaro GCC 4.8-2014.04 r47197) ) #60 SMP Tue Oct 11 15:44:52 CEST 2016</code></pre></div><p>I googled for <em>r47197 </em>and it seems to be an on old version from 2014...<br />I don&#039;t know if this is relevant..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sanjibukai</strong> on 5 Mar 2017, 18:33)</p>
