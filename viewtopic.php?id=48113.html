					<p>First thing might be to upgrade to a newer BB trunk version. 34054 is over a year old, and the trunk has got many fixes since then.</p><p>The contents of /etc/config/network, /etc/config/dhcp, /etc/config/firewall and /etc/config/wireless come first into mind as helpful info for debugging. You need to get into the console prompt and copy the contents from there.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 31 Dec 2013, 16:43)</p>

					<p>Thank you for the responses.</p><p>I went around and around about the version. I am using Barrier Breaker because it was part of ArunK&#039;s package.</p><p>I will first look into updating Barrier Breaker and LuCI. Then I will come back to the Guest Network bit.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello People,</p><p>I have to get back to the Real World in the next several days. I am going to delay upgrading BB.
