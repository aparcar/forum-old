					<p>Hello.</p><p>I&#039;ve been using TL-WA901ND access points (all with v2 and v3 hardware version) with stock firmware and now I need to expand their possibilities, so I&#039;m about to flash them with OpenWRT. The problem I have is that hardware version v4 isn&#039;t supported right now, so in case I need to expand my installation or any device crashes, I can&#039;t buy a new TL-WA901ND, because Amazon only ships the last version.</p><p>I need 2.4GHz access points with similar range, OpenWRT support and PoE support. If it had more memory, it should be great. Which device could I buy? I don&#039;t find anything with those requirements... (TP-Link WR843ND for example hasn&#039;t got range enough)</p><p>Thanks in advance for your support.</p>									</div>
