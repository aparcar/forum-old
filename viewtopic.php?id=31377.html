					<p>AFAIK and depends on the usage of the device, there are other devices one can contemplate to get. For instance, if one wants to build a 3G (perhaps 4G) WiFi router, one can invest on a 3G / 4G USB dongle + a 4-port giga switch + a low price of a $40 [url=http://www.buy.com/prod/pogoplug-multimedia-sharing-device-pink/q/loc/101/213816247.html]Pogoplug Multimedia Sharing Device[url](POGOE02) that has lots of NAND space (256MB?) and RAM (256MB?) and four USB2 ports on an ARM9 platform clocked @1.2GHz.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mazilo</strong> on 15 Aug 2011, 15:20)</p>

					<p>Soekris <br /> - Overpriced ($253). I can get 3 plug computers for the same price. <br /> - This sucker needs an external power supply and uses 20Watt.<br /> - Geode Clock speed (433Mhz) is 3 times slower than Marvel (1.2Ghz)</p><p>Intel Desktop Board<br /> + Nice option if you want to build your own low-end multimedia center. Not very practical as a dedicated server due to unnecessary audio / video card.<br /> - Requires an external power supply and external Wifi adapter<br /> + Passively cooled 1.6Ghz Atom processor, 2GB ram<br /> - More than twice as big as any plug computers, and only marginally faster.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>F1aw</strong> on 31 Aug 2011, 00:21)</p>

					<p>Just as a followup to this thread, I ended up getting Buffalo wzr-hp-g300nh2 for $60. That is a good price for a 400mhz device with 32/64 flash/ram. I do not think there is anything out there that would beat that. I was considering DockStar for 40$, but it requires opening the case and soldering in a serial console. Plus DockStar is missing WiFi. I was also considering Plug computers, but you will have to spend around $150 for the unit+jtag. You are also likely to spend another 100$ on heatsinks, thermal glue, fan, external PSU, all just to avoid overheating issues.</p><p>Overall I am happy with my Buffalo. I have managed to tolerate DD-WRT for only one week. Got frustrated with the absence of firewall config and Samba, lack or other config options.
