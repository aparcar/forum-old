					<p>In advance I am apologising because of lack of proper skills.</p><p>When I can I always trying to read and learn. I managed to open needed port to use with Transmission but I still having problem.</p><p>Accorsding to <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/">http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a> port I am using with transmission-daemon is open and tracker I use when I do connection check it&#039;s showing connection successful, that means port is open. But still having problem, let me explain.</p><p>First, when I use uTorrent on Windows PC torrent from specific tracker goes on download right away, once torrent is complete it&#039;s starting to upload right away. Same torrent, same tracker, same file on transmission ... no movement at all. It&#039;s showing indeed connected to tracker BUT no download. So even If I download data in Windows , move it to transmission, after verification is complete and transmission start to seed , nothing is happening. On Windows uTorrent upload right away I see people downloading off me.</p><p>And Main point when I do transmission-remote -pt (Port Check) it&#039;s showing NO. So as far as transmission concerned port is closed.</p><p>I am stuck and don&#039;t know what to do, can anyone help me ? Port I am trying to open is 51401, like I said before <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/">http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a> showing it&#039;s open transmission saying it&#039;s closed .....</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@WRT1900AC:~# transmission-remote -pt
Port is open: No
root@WRT1900AC:~#</code></pre></div><p>Thank you guys ! I really appreciate all help, if you need any info from my configuration let me know I&#039;&#039;ll provide whatever you need.</p>									</div>

					<p>My guess would be that you did not configure port forward manually.</p><p>So when uTorrent starts on your Windows PC it makes port forward reservation (opens a port) via UPnP. AFAIK the UPnP reservation lasts for a while, even after you quit uTorrent on your Windows PC, that&#039;s why transmission-daemon complains that the port is closed -- it can&#039;t claim the same port as the router knows it&#039;s been reserved by your Windows PC.</p><p>I suggest you don&#039;t use the same port for different devices (Windows PC and router).</p>									</div>

					<p>Ports on uTorrent and Transmission are different, Did I mention I use same Port on both programs ? If I did this is wrong I use 51400 and 51401</p>									</div>

					<p>Both, I tried manually (I managed to get PORT OPEN on all online checkers) yet transmission showing port closed. I also installed miniupnpd , nothing happened.</p><p>If possible can you please let me know how to open port 51400 , whatever way possible</p>									</div>

					<p>With UPnP it should work automagically, at least it does work for me, although I don&#039;t have transmission-daemon running on the router, I have it on another Linux machine. </p><p>With miniupnpd and luci-app-upnp installed you should be able to see active UPnP redirects with Luci. </p><p>Maybe it&#039;s an issue with transmission-daemon config?</p>									</div>
