					<p>Hello All,</p><p>I&#039;ve read some posts about the difference between brcm47xx and brcm-2.4 as in:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24549">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=24549</a></p><p>It seems it&#039;s a good idea to keep the brcm-2.4 when upgrading for the model WRT54GL. Now the WRTSL54GS has 32 MB RAM, that&#039;s twice the WRT54GL size.</p><p>I also noticed:</p><p><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39714">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39714</a></p><p>and </p><p><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7552">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/7552</a></p><p>It seems the brcm47xx issues are gone.</p><p>So, I&#039;m confused. Is it a good idea to upgrade to Attitude Adjstment from:</p><p><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09/brcm47xx/generic/openwrt-wrtsl54gs-squashfs.bin">http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_a … uashfs.bin</a>&nbsp; ?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Skater</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t give you facts, but:<br />1. why upgrade if your router does everything you need<br />2. those post you quote are quite old, and things change quite quickly in the openWRT world<br />3. there is no build of AA final for the WRTSL: I don&#039;t know if this is due to lack of interest or because it doesn&#039;t work<br />4. you could back up what you have and try a self-built AA just to see.<br />5.
