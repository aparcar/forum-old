					<p>I have a D-Link DIR-825 rev. B1 router and am using OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)&nbsp; and kernel 3.3.8.</p><p>This router is configured to have one wifi point using G and one using N.<br />I would like to configure another secure wifi point so that when connected to it I would get a different DNS server setting. This wifi point will be used to connect to a US DNS service (<a href="http://tunlr.net/">http://tunlr.net/</a>). I want the normal points to have access to the local network and internet. This third connection will only have access to the internet. (I really like Pandora!).</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>									</div>
