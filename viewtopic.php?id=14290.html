					<p>Hi, I&#039;ve created a set of scripts for configuring and updating dynamic DNS in Kamikaze. A UCI config file (/etc/config/ddns) can be used to configure what service to connect to (e.g. dyndns.org, no-ip.com etc), how often to check for updates, and how often to force an update.&nbsp; The script uses wget to perform updates.&nbsp; Specifically, I&#039;ve created a new wget package that can connect via ssl, but doesn&#039;t require openssl which takes up a megabyte of disk space.&nbsp; Instead, the new package links to matrixssl, which is only 90K.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also created a new version of libmatrixssl, as the old version is very out of date.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also verified that the two existing packages that link to matrixssl (matrixtunnel and mini_httpd) work fine with the new version.&nbsp; I have posted <a href="http://people.bu.edu/ebishop/ddns-wget-matrix.html">a detailed description of the new packages here.</a> Both source code and ipkg files for the three packages are available.&nbsp; You can <a href="http://people.bu.edu/ebishop/ddns-wget-matrix-source.tar.gz">download the source code here</a>, and you can <a href="http://people.bu.edu/ebishop/ddns-wget-matrix-ipk-mipsel24.tar.gz">download the (binary) pacakge files here</a>.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.&nbsp; I first linked wget to matrixssl as a way for ddns-scripts to update via https.&nbsp; However, since there was no activity on this thread for a really long time I figured no one was too interested.&nbsp; In the mean time I created a new ddns update client in C that links directly to matrixssl so I could eliminate the need for wget altogether.&nbsp; </p><p>However, a couple of weeks ago jaime (above) emailed me, asking about it and thanks to him I figured out (finally) how to replicate the error and how to fix it.&nbsp; The problem only occurs if you are using one of the trunk builds that uses uclibc v0.9.29 instead of v0.9.28 which kamikaze 7.09 uses.&nbsp; Since I&#039;ve been doing all my development on Kamikaze 7.09, finding the error drove me crazy.</p><p>Basically, the pthreads implementation in that version is a bit screwed up, matrixssl uses the mutex code in libpthread to ensure thread safety, and the two don&#039;t play nice together.&nbsp; The way I got it working was by&nbsp; creating a version of matrixssl that is not thread safe and linking wget to it.&nbsp; Since wget doesn&#039;t use threads, this cannot cause any problems.&nbsp; </p><p>The reason I wanted to&nbsp; create a new ddns client was for my new web interface, Gargoyle, which I have just released.&nbsp; (See below post, or visit <a href="http://www.gargoyle-router.com">http://www.gargoyle-router.com</a> for more info)&nbsp; Even though wget-matrixssl is not used by Gargoyle I have included the code for it on the Gargoyle svn, and the package is available for download from the Gargoyle package repositories (available for atheros 2.6 and broadcom 2.4 routers).&nbsp; </p><p>If you are running on other hardware you will need to compile it for yourself.&nbsp; You can checkout a copy of the gargoyle code (which&nbsp; includes wget-matrixssl) from the svn by running the following command:<br />svn checkout <a href="https://svn.assembla.com/svn/gargoyle-router/trunk">https://svn.assembla.com/svn/gargoyle-router/trunk</a></p><p>All this, of course, skirts the question as to whether this&nbsp; will be included in the upcoming release of Kamikaze.&nbsp; The best answer I can give you right now is: I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I want to see what the overall community&#039;s reaction is to the Gargoyle code (love it/hate it/ignore it) before deciding whether to&nbsp; post a bunch of patches&nbsp; that add the code for it to the openwrt svn.&nbsp; Granted, wget-matrixssl is a special case that&#039;s&nbsp; not part of the main interface, but for now I&#039;m going to wait and see.</p><p>If you REALLY want this included I suggest you make a patch yourself from the&nbsp; gargoyle svn and send&nbsp; it to the developers mailing list yourself.&nbsp; I promise not to be offended, especially if&nbsp; you mention where you got it in your email.&nbsp; My guess is that the developers don&#039;t care too much who the code comes from so long as it works.&nbsp; Be aware you&#039;ll need patches for both wget-matrixssl and libmatrixssl-nothread.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply.<br />Yes, I did patch against wget-1.11.2.&nbsp; I looked that over carefully before blinding applying the patches.</p><p>There were a few Windows related porting problems, but they were easily overcome.<br />One was straight C source files cannot declare new variables in a function after the first executable<br />statement.&nbsp; MSVC6 sees that as a C++ feature.&nbsp; So in two spots in matrixssl.c I moved some declarations<br />up to the top.</p><p>Next, in matrixssl_helper.c, _ssl_setSocketBlock() and _ssl_setSocketNonblock() make use of of calls<br />which Windows doesn&#039;t support.&nbsp; &nbsp;I replaced:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) | O_NONBLOCK);</code></pre></div><p>with:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    #ifdef WINDOWS
    unsigned long flags;
    flags = TRUE;
    ioctlsocket(fd, FIONBIO, &amp;flags);
#else
    fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) | O_NONBLOCK);
#endif // #ifdef WINDOWS</code></pre></div><p>But most importantly, there seems to be a logic error in SSL_peek().<br />When wget is peeking to find the end of the HTTP headers, and if those headers are<br />longer than its initial 511 read request, the buffering logic in SSL_peek() causes<br />the data returned by the first call to peek to be lost on the next call(s).&nbsp; It uses<br />read internally which advances the pointer, forgetting it&#039;s just a peek.</p><p>You have comments in one place:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>    if(available &gt; 0)
    {
        //we seem never to get here BUT the _ssl_read method in the helper functions
        //already had the provision to return with the data in the inbuf if it has
        //data in it.  This suggests  there might be data in it under some bizarre
        //condition and we certainly don&#039;t want to lose it if it exists.  So -- if there 
        //is data in there we&#039;ll just use that instead of trying to read more and 
        //putting it in the inbuf</code></pre></div><p>I found the code just below which I believe to be the reason for that never being executed:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>        if(read_bytes &gt; 0)
        {
            memcpy(buf, newBuf, read_bytes);

            // WRL -- bug here
            // frees the wrong buffer and goofs up the pointers.
            // ssl-&gt;inbuf.start was advanced above inside SSL_read,
            // so now we have to back it up since we&#039;re only peeking.
            
            // free(ssl-&gt;inbuf.buf);
            free(newBuf);

            //ssl-&gt;inbuf.start = ssl-&gt;inbuf.buf = (unsigned char*)newBuf;
            //ssl-&gt;inbuf.end = (unsigned char*)newBuf+read_bytes;
            //ssl-&gt;inbuf.size = bufsize;
            ssl-&gt;inbuf.start -= read_bytes;
        }</code></pre></div><p>This bug and these changes were found and tested with this URL:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn">https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn</a></p><p>I&#039;m not suggesting this is -the- fix, but I offer it for your consideration.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Bill</p>									</div>
