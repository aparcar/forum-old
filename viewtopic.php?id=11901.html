					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I have a wrtsl54gs and I am using Kamikaze 7.07 (2.4 kernel).</p><p>I noticed that the mac address of the wireless interface was incorrect (00:10:18:90:20:DB) so I erased the nvram because I was told that the NIC mac address was set via cfe using settings stored the nvram.&nbsp; &nbsp;This did not work either, but I noticed an nvram setting &quot;il0macaddr&quot; with the correct mac address.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hrmm.&nbsp; So I reinstalled the stock linksys firmware and checked the mac addresses listed on the status page.&nbsp; Everything was correct.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I re-flashed over tftp back to Kamikaze again, and the mac address for the wireless was incorrect again!</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I know it is possible to set the mac address in the config files (that is what I have done for now)&nbsp; but still something seems wrong.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t have to do that.</p><br /><p>Thanks,<br />Sam</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Sam,</p><p>I had the same problem under WR 0.9 ....<br />It can be &quot;fixed&quot; by adding an init script ..<br />Create an init script in /etc/init.d/ named S98fix_wl0_mac:</p><p>#!/bin/sh<br />wifi down<br />ifconfig `nvram get wl0_ifname` down<br />ifconfig `nvram get wl0_ifname` hw ether `nvram get wl0_hwaddr`<br />ifconfig `nvram get wl0_ifname` up<br />wifi up</p><p>chmod +x /etc/init.d/S98fix_wl0_mac</p><p>This works in WR 0.9 but not sure about Kamikaze ...<br />Should work if the nvram variable are set ... </p><p>Noel</p>									</div>

					<p>This is a problem under Whiterussian and Kamikaze.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is an easy one-time fix for both.&nbsp; I agree that this is probably a bug because it seems to be specific to WRTSL54GS.</p><p>Whiterussian:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>nvram set wifi_hwaddr=$(nvram get wl0_hwaddr)
nvram commit</code></pre></div><p>Kamikaze:<br />(Note: change the <strong>wl0</strong> in network.<strong>wl0</strong>.macaddr to whatever you named your wireless device in /etc/config/wireless and /etc/config/network)</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.wl0.macaddr=$(nvram get wl0_hwaddr)
