					<p>Hi,</p><p>I want to configure a WT3020H to be a Wifi bridge, but also running a DHCP server and a router.</p><p>I have a Roku box, which needs to receive custom DNS settings via DHCP, and I also want to add some static routes to remove access to some addresses (to allow switching Netflix regions).</p><p>I thought this would be relatively straightforward - I have the setup I want running with a linux box and a dd-wrt router. The dd-wrt is a wifi client bridge. The linux box runs a (second) dhcp server, but the roku is connected with a cable so it always serves it with a response first (other clients connect via wifi so get a response from the ISP router DHCP server first). The linux box also acts as a router for the device and blocks the IPs required. </p><p>However, I am struggling to configure openwrt and have now bricked 2 devices (I have more on order). Apparently failsafe mode doesn&#039;t work with this model. I am using the build from here:<br /><a href="http://onionwrt.link/download/">http://onionwrt.link/download/</a><br />The first time I did something silly (removed lan interface), the second time I just tried to bridge the wifi and lan, changed the IP of the bridged interface to something on the correct wifi subnet, and lost access.</p><p>Its not clear to me how to achieve the setup I want and I am obviously a bit out of my depth. If the openwrt cannot bridge on this hardware, it would be fine to have a seperate subnet on the LAN port, with NAT.</p><p>Can anyone through any light. When the new batch arrives I would be happy to pay an expert for an hour or so of consultancy (or make a donation to the project) if it could help me get it working.</p><p>PS Any help to recover the 2 bricked devices would also be great. I have a CP2012 USB on order so I hope I will be able to reset them from the console.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>thrope</strong> on 15 Mar 2015, 13:05)</p>

					<p>Bump!</p><p>My next two WT3020H&#039;s have turned up so I would like to look at getting them configured this weekend.</p><p>Would it be possible to get any help?</p><p>I would be happy to pay for some consulting with paypal either directly or as a donation to the project.</p><p>I think I would need about an hour from an expert (10 minutes to hear my requirements, 10 minutes to explain the process, remaining time for trouble shooting!)</p><p>I have 3 different configurations I would like to know how to acheive:</p><p>1)&nbsp; WT3020H acting as a wifi bridge to a separate private subnet (LAN port). Acting as DHCP server. This would be a double nat (Wifi would be from a home router).</p><p>2) WT3020H acting as a wifi bridge (same subnet), but also acting as a second DHCP server on the network giving out different DNS settings to a device connected to the LAN port. Also acting as a router for the LAN port client (need static routes to drop some IPs for that client device). WAN port should also be bridged to wifi (but doesn&#039;t need the DHCP server).</p><p>3) WT3020H acting as a wifi bridge (same subnet). E.g. to connect an ethernet printer to a home wifi connection.</p><p>I also have 2 bricked WT3020H I would like to try and recover using a serial console. </p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I made some progress using a more up to date openwrt build.</p><p>I have followed the instructions here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p><p>Since the WT3020 seemed to be using the mac80211 driver.</p><p>I have given the lan bridge a static IP on the existing wifi network. I have joined this in client wds mode, and the WT3020 wifi interface is added to the lan bridge.</p><p>The wifi shows as connected in Luci but I cannot ping to access point router. It may be the access point (provided by ISP) does not support bridging. However, I have a dd-wrt router connected and bridged successfully with &quot;Client Bridge&quot; mode in dd-wrt. I am not sure if this is the same as WDS mode.</p><p>At this point I would be really happy to pay for someone to help me get this working. Would $50 for 0.5-1h consultancy interest anyone?</p>									</div>
