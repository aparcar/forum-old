					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have a working version of wireless router board running latest kamikaze bridged directly to the LAN network to access internet. All went fine .</p><p>Today I have connected the Linksys BEFSR41 EtherfastÂ® Cable/DSL Router to the wireless board. Now, I have the following problem.&nbsp; </p><p>The wireless board receives an IP address from the LinkSys router by DHCP and only Ping works fine.&nbsp; But there is no acess to the internet connection and wget &amp; ssh shows nothing. tcpdump shows no TCP responses for the wget and ssh. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Internet &lt;-------------&gt;&nbsp; LINKSYS BEFSR41 EtherfastÂ® Cable/DSL Router (1 of 4 switch port)&lt;-----------&gt; (eth0)Wireless board (ath0). </p><p>Can anybody point me, why there is no reponse for TCP connection when the board is connected through DSL router ?</p><p>thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sara</strong> on 19 Jan 2009, 15:48)</p>
