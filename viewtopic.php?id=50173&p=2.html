See photo at link below to show how I unhooked the side clip to gain better access to the serial connector. I was going to use a screwdriver to do this but reverted to using a plastic utensil to prise apart (metal screwdriver will most defo leave a mark on the plastic which may affect your warranty!).</p><p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/7cqbhqalb/">http://postimg.org/image/7cqbhqalb/</a></p><p>Follow NYT&#039;s guide&#039;s (a few posts above) with reference to the internal serial connection. I have a USB / Serial&nbsp; TTL convertor in my tool box and used that for this purpose.</p><p>As a previous poster said, if you have already put the initial first build of Openwrt on this router and then go and program the newer &quot;barrier breaker&quot; through the web gui, it will BRICK the router. This happened to me today!!<br />Only way to correct this situation is to program the new firmware from the Serial console with a tftp server that hosts the img file as NYT mentioned. </p><p>I&#039;m all good now:)</p><p>And a big thank-you to NYT for your guides in this thread <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>guitarman</strong> on 27 Apr 2014, 00:10)</p>
