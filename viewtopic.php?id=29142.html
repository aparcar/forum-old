					<p>I just bought one of these to test out and play with. It would be nice if I could use the enterprise features in OpenWrt. Searching I found other people asking this a few months back but no answers yet. </p><p> It looks like it&#039;s the Atheros AR7240 CPU. I&#039;m not sure which signifies the exact chipset but I see AG7240 and AG7240CHH loading in dmesg.
