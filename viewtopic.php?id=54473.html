					<p>I am not familiar with that model but I assume it has a downconverter of some sort which lowers the voltage supplied by the external PS to whatever the unit accepts. If this is not true, please ignore my suggestion. Otherwise, you might check if the converter is still working and connected to the input jack.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>aboaboit</strong> on 8 Dec 2014, 16:13)</p>

					<p>I will post a photo of it. I have a voltmeter, but I lack knowledge of how to check if components are working. </p><p>I&#039;ve been measuring some voltages across elements and they were 12V on the on-off switch, 5,2V and 1,1 on capacitors in the vicinity of jack.</p>									</div>

					<p>Plug in the 12 volts, see if you have 3.3 volts on the VCC line.&nbsp; The 8 pin chips with inductors nearby are the primary voltage regulators.&nbsp; All the logic and memory chips in a router run on 3.3 volts or a lower voltage that is locally regulated down from the 3.3 volts.&nbsp; The 5 volt regulator is only for the USB port.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mk24</strong> on 8 Dec 2014, 17:39)</p>

					<p>Thank you mk24. I don&#039;t have 3,3V there.

					<p>I must add that powering with 5V through VCC still makes the router working although now I don&#039;t know if this is still a good idea.</p>									</div>
