					<p>Hi. I&#039;ve seen this gadget:<br /><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-3g-wireless-openwrt-wifi-router/1966302560.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shi â€¦ 02560.html</a><br />It claims to run OpenWRT, and some digging indicates it&#039;s a Qualcomm MDM6085 chipset which I think might be Atheros???<br />I&#039;m not averse to popping one open, soldering on a serial terminal, compiling OpenWRT and tftping an image, but kernel hacking, custom device drivers and much jtag would be beyond me. Is there any support for this, and if not, how much work would it be to get it going?<br />Thanks.<br />Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>OK, I&#039;ve got one now. It appears to be visually similar to <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/maplin-3g-n150-wireless-mi-fi-router-with-battery-requires-data-sim-card-a25lw">this one</a>. I can telnet in to a busybox prompt, but it&#039;s very limited - no ls, even!<br />I&#039;ve popped it open and there&#039;s an interesting set of pads - jtag??? Here&#039;s the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0vlI_yVRiQsR1FCZHFyNlBDSWs/view?usp=sharing">battery side</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0vlI_yVRiQsMGZfMWFZU0pnaFU/view">front</a>. What&#039;s the next steps to getting OpenWRT on this - any ideas of the pinout of the header? I&#039;ll try and see if I can get any further with telnet and getting to the SD card.</p>									</div>

					<p>Just to revive this ancient thread, yes the Maplin device seems to be the same.<br />I&#039;ve managed to get a JTAG pinout.<br />With the device the &quot;right&quot; way up, network socket at the bottom, USB at the top, looking from the back, there&#039;s the solder pads, one on its own over the right end, then two rows of 8 pads.<br />Top row: *B*CDF** Bottom row: *A***E** (I tried to do an ASCII art, but it seemed broken.)<br />A=GND, B=TMS, C=TDO, D=TDI, E=TRST, F=TCK<br />Voltage=1.8V<br />Info I&#039;ve got:<br />Device ID: 0100 0111101100110110 00001110000 1 (0x47B360E1)<br />Manufacturer ID: 0x070<br />Part Number: 0x7B36<br />Which seems to be an LSdigital ARM1136<br />Next step, try and suck an image out.</p>									</div>
