					<p>hello guys.</p><p>I have managed to setup a ipv6 tunnel in openwrt barrier breaker using hurricane electric services. One of my goals was to setup a webserver in a linux machine that could be reached using an ipv6 address. Initially I couldn&#039;t manage that, until on firewall settings, i set all the zones to acept input, forward, etc. Unfortunately this opened undesirable ports, for example my openwrt webgui is visible everyone if you type the ip address of such device.</p><p>How can i open specific ports in openwrt, for example port 80 and forward it to my ipv6 server behind the openwrt router ? How can i block undesired ports ? </p><p>i want to open or close specific ports without making my whole router or my servers fully exposed to ipv6 internet.<br />thanks in advance.</p>									</div>

If you want to do port forwards (aka DNAT) it should be possible, but you may need to write custom rules (I am not sure).</p><p>You should be able to allow traffic to your webserver by adding a rule to Firewall - Traffic Rules:</p><p>config rule<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option src &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option family &#039;ipv6&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;tcp&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option name &#039;webserver&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_ip &#039;&lt;ipv6 address&gt;&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option dest_port &#039;80&#039;</p>									</div>

					<p>hi mikma</p><p>thanks for you clear answer. I am going to apply it.</p><p>I asked this because, I thought since my webserver has a global routable address, there was no need to do so, but i was wrong, my openwrt router with ipv6 was blocking port 80 on my webserver.</p><p>thanks a lot</p>									</div>
