					<p>The point behind my openWrt install is to do some hands on learning, but the more I do and read the more befuddled I get.</p><p>Is there anyplace I can see the text of the default config files? /etc/config/network in particular.<br />I have made so many edits, I no longer remember where I started. I would like to compare in an effort to figure out why my config is not working the way I think it should.</p><p>Can anyone describe interface type &#039;bridge&#039; to me? I think this is a case of reading the same documentation so many times it no longer makes sense. I need to hear the ideas in different words now.</p><p>What other interface types are there?</p><p>Do I need two interfaces to make a bridge interface? (one fore eth0 and one for wireless?) And what does the syntax for this look like? do they each need different IP addresses?</p><p>If I do not bridge will my ethernet ports and my wifi be on two separate networks with their own IP blocks and so on?</p><p>my config file has some options that I can&#039;t find documentation on, such as &quot;_orig_ifname&quot; and &quot;_orig_bridge&quot;. What does this do?</p><p>what happens if there are three or four interfaces? Well, I know what happens when I make three of four interfaces... nothing works quite the way I expect it too. What am I supposed to expect?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bigSky</strong> on 6 Dec 2014, 18:36)</p>

And what does the syntax for this look like? do they each need different IP addresses?</p></blockquote></div><p>What the others have said on this topic is a good start, but there is one OpenWRT-specific quirk when it comes to bridging WIFI interfaces. In the docs for network config (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</a>) there is a note mentioning &quot;Wlan interface names are not predictable, therfore you cannot reference them directly in the network config&quot;. In practice, this means you declare WIFI interfaces in /etc/config/wireless instead of /etc/config/network and OpenWRT does some magic behind the scenes to bridge the two. If you want to have the WIFI interface be a part of a network bridge containing your wired ethernet interface (this is the default configuration on routers I have used), you set &quot;option network bridged-network-name-here&quot; for the wifi interface in /etc/config/wireless . That means the two config files that look like this:</p><p><em>/etc/config/wireless</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;wifi-iface&#039;
        option &#039;device&#039;     &#039;wl0&#039;
        option &#039;network&#039;    &#039;lan&#039;
        option &#039;mode&#039;       &#039;ap&#039;
        option &#039;ssid&#039;       &#039;MyWifiAP&#039;</code></pre></div><p><em>/etc/config/network</em><br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface lan
        option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth0&#039;
        option &#039;type&#039; &#039;bridge&#039;
        option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;
        option &#039;ipaddr&#039; &#039;192.168.1.1&#039;
        option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>are bridging the wifi interface and the eth0 interface, even though this isn&#039;t explicit in the network config. So yeah, it&#039;s definitely a little confusing!</p><p>Some practical notes about bridging is that it means if you have DHCP clients connecting to this router, their IP addresses will be part of the same subnet no matter which interface they connect to (wifi or ethernet) and traffic can flow between devices connected on either interface without worrying about firewall rules. The only other interface type is just un-bridged, set by removing the &quot;option type bridge&quot; line. If an interface is not bridged, you will have to allow traffic to be forwarded in/out in the firewall config. For an example of this, see this recipe: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedap">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/routedap</a> (The recipes are a good place to learn in general!)</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>bigSky wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>my config file has some options that I can&#039;t find documentation on, such as &quot;_orig_ifname&quot; and &quot;_orig_bridge&quot;. What does this do?</p></blockquote></div><p>I believe that&#039;s the result of setting configuration options using the web interface, LUCI. Maybe it happens when you change configuration using `uci` from the command line too? Not sure; I usually edit the config files directly in vim, but I&#039;ve seen these _orig_ settings pop up from time to time when I make changes some other way.</p><br /><div class="quotebox"><cite>bigSky wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Tried that and it preserved my altered config files. Almost locked myself out of all access, nervous about trying again. Yes I screwed up not making backups in the first place, surly the default config exists somewhere for me to look at.</p></blockquote></div><p>Try this again, but before you do, edit /etc/sysupgrade.conf and remove the /etc/config line-- all files/directories in this .conf file are preserved when doing a system upgrade/re-flash. And if you lock yourself out of access some how, you can usually get back in by going into failsafe mode: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe</a></p>									</div>
