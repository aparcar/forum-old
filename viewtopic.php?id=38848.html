					<p>So I&#039;m running <br />OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment r33212 / LuCI Trunk (trunk+svn9093)&nbsp; on a Netgear WDNR3800</p><p>And it works great, esp my HE 6in4 tunnel now.&nbsp; So I figured I would try and start monitoring my bandwidth usage.</p><p>I installed snmpd and mini_snmpd.&nbsp; I know both can&#039;t be running.&nbsp; I was seeing what was different between them.&nbsp; Anyway.. mini is disabled now.</p><p>I can walk the router and see all kinds of data.&nbsp; So I went to Cacti and added my router as a device and as a Cisco Router.</p><p>It sees the interfaces.&nbsp; So I picked br-lan and pppoe-wan.</p><p>I&#039;ve waited a long time and no data in the graphs. </p><p>I walk teh router and can see the data changing so suspect I&#039;m not doing something right.</p><p>I then re-installed luci-app-statistics.&nbsp; It graphed for like 5 min... then quit.&nbsp; No more data going into the graphs.</p><p>Is this an underlying issue with SNMP?&nbsp; </p><p>Any advise?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
