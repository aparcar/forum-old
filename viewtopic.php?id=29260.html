					<p>Hey all,</p><p>Just looking at the possibility of getting OpenWRT on this device. It&#039;s a Buffalo WLAE-AG300N AP/Bridge. </p><p>I got the following information off of the chips:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>SiGe 2593a20
ar9280-al1a
ar7240-ah1a
hynix h5du2562gtr-e3c</code></pre></div><p>It has a spot for a 4 pin serial console attachment. I&#039;ve soldered on wires and am awaiting a usb/ttl convertor to try to get some console from the device.</p><p>I&#039;ll get some pictures of the board when I get home later.</p><p>It appears this is a supported platform and wireless chip. What are the chances of getting OpenWrt up and running on it? The stock firmware is really bad.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ahh. So my first ram disk image I attempted to load worked. Since then I haven&#039;t been able to get it to boot, even the same image. Best I can do is get it to &quot;Starting kernel....&quot; and then nothing else.</p><br /><p>Any tips?</p><p>EDIT: So a typo is what apparently made it work before. </p><p>Is there any documentation on how the memory addressing works? I first attempted to tftp the image to 0x80000000 but got error during decompression and a reset on starting the image. I read somewhere that the likely case was the decompression was overwriting the information in memory. So I tried a different location, thinking I was attempting 0x82000000, I apparently actually tried 0x8200000 (note the missing zero). This boots the image.</p><p>This device has 32MB of ram, so I&#039;m just trying to figure out how the addressing works.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Fuzzlet</strong> on 27 Mar 2011, 21:30)</p>

					<p>Sorry to drag up an ancient thread but I&#039;m having problems finding anything using the forum search.</p><p>According to ToH, which doesn&#039;t have a wiki page for this device yet, some support was added here: <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/32931/trunk">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/32931/trunk</a></p><p>This appears to be before the Attitude Adjustment release.&nbsp; Is this device supported?&nbsp; If so, should I just flash a generic ar71xx to it? (I&#039;m currently stuck on dd-wrt which won&#039;t allow me to re-flash stock Buffalo firmware and want to try OpenWRT anyway.) I can document what I do in a wiki page for the WLAE AG300N, but I don&#039;t really know the procedure for flashing &quot;generic&quot; OpenWRT images - a link or two would be great <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
