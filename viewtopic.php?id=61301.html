					<p>Hello people!</p><p>I&#039;m looking at trying out OpenWrt as I&#039;m having stability and wifi range problems with my Netgear router. It&#039;s a model that OpenWrt doesn&#039;t support so I&#039;m shopping for hardware. My home theatre PC currently does a few things that demand he stay awake at all times. I&#039;d like to move those activities onto the router to save power.</p><p>OpenVPN<br />Tends to be 2 users at the most but fairly demanding, high bandwidth, low latency needed when connected.</p><p>Transmission<br />My Transmission server tends to be quite busy and I have a 40mb internet connection</p><p>What sort of performance can I expect from the Pi? Is it a good choice? Would I be better with a complete router? I&#039;m having a really hard time identifying routers with decent hardware that openwrt supports which are available to buy.</p><p>What about the USB ethernet and wifi dongles I selected below, will they work ok? They both mention Linux support.</p><p>I&#039;m considering the following purchases:<br />Raspberry Pi v2<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Desktop-Linux/dp/B00T2U7R7I/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449159528&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+2">Amazon</a><br />£29.50</p><p>Raspberry case (Wall mount)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/iGuerburn-Transparent-Raspberry-Aluminum-Heatsink/dp/B00YBS1010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449159488&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon</a><br />£5.99</p><p>MicroSD 8gb<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/SanDisk-Android-microSDHC-Adapter-Version/dp/B013UDL5RU/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449158948&amp;sr=1-1&nbsp; &nbsp; ">Amazon</a><br />£8.45</p><p>Alfa Network AWUS036AC WIFI<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Network-AWUS036AC-Long-Range-Dual-Band-Connections/dp/B00MX57AO4">Amazon</a><br />£27.46</p><p>USB Ethernet Adapter for WAN<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-LINK-UE300-Ethernet-Foldable-Ultrabook/dp/B00YOKMKE6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449159233&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon</a><br />£12.99</p>									</div>

I just want to know if RasperryPi is a sane choice and if it&#039;s going to melt with 3 networks and other services. I&#039;d rather not waste my time and money if I&#039;m going to have a lot of problems that I can&#039;t foresee.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>J1mbo wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Since it will run Debian (and therefore iptables and hostapd) natively, the question for me is why bother with OpenWRT. The WebUI might be one reason.</p></blockquote></div><p>Two reasons. <br />1: I want to try OpenWRT and my existing router won&#039;t do it. Curiosity.<br />2: The web UI plus out of the box handling of WAN and LAN services - I want a drop in replacement for my existing router, plus Transmission and openVPN. If I have to manually configure iptables then I&#039;m capable of choosing a Linux distro for the job.

This is on hold until January now but that looks like a good consideration.</p><p>Would anyone like to comment on what LAN and Wifi performance will be like compared to a real router? Is there any reason why it would be worse?</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Nurg</strong> on 8 Dec 2015, 17:21)</p>
