					<p>First off, I am pretty new to Linux, only been practicing it for the last month or so. So forgive me if this is a stupid question.</p><p>I am completely lost with BusyBox. I have looked all over and gained no ground regarding it and OpenWrt. All I&#039;m trying to do is install a postgres sql server on my wrt1900ac linksys router. The first requirement for it is (taken from the tutorial):</p><p>&quot;Since PostgreSQL is not running as root user you have to recompile BusyBox with adduser, deluser, addgroup, delgroup, su and sulogin. Then the postinst script creates the postgres user automatically for you.&quot;</p><p>How on earth do I do this? Is there an easy way I can add this applet to BusyBox? If not, can someone please point me to a tutorial so I can recompile it? When I run &quot;busybox&quot; from inside the bin folder I get this:</p><p>BusyBox v1.23.2 (2015-07-24 23:41:29 CEST) multi-call binary.<br />BusyBox is copyrighted by many authors between 1998-2012.<br />Licensed under GPLv2.

					<p>I am sure you will get better answers, but as I see it, you have two choices, recompile busybox for your router, or compile the real postgreSQL for your router.</p><p>busybox is a slimmed down multi-call binary. And they throw out lots of functionality to keep the binary small.<br /><a href="https://busybox.net/">https://busybox.net/</a></p>									</div>

					<p>No need to recompile busybox for aduser, su, ...<br />They are available as separate packages. Look for shadow-su and coreutils-*.<br />You even can manually edit /etc/passwd and /etc/group&nbsp; then use &quot;passwd&quot; command to set password for a user</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 2 Mar 2016, 09:16)</p>
