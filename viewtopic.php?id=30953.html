					<p>I have found that the newer Buffalo routers are very sensitive to the TFTP process and ended up using Ubuntu 10.10 within VirtualBox to do any of the TFTP flashing. There are instructions online for this and I have recently flashed OpenWRT onto 4 WZR-HP-G300NH&#039;s (Backfire 10.03.1-RC5) and 2 WZR-HP-AG300H&#039;s (trunk). Here are the steps which I have used:</p><p>1. boot with ubunto live cd,<br />2. sudo apt-get update<br />3. sudo apt-get install tftp-hpa</p><p>4. sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop<br />5. sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.11.2<br />6. sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0 </p><p>7. sudo arp -s 192.168.11.1 [MAC Address without :&#039;s]</p><p>8. tftp 192.168.11.1<br />9. tftp&gt;binary<br />10. tftp&gt;rexmt 1<br />11. tftp&gt;timeout 60<br />12. tftp&gt;connect 192.168.11.1<br />13. tftp&gt;put openwrt-10.03.1-rc5-ar71xx-wzr-hp-g300nh-squashfs-tftp.bin</p><br /><p>14. connect your router and power on (as quickly as possible)</p>									</div>

					<p>I have ONLY had to use the 02AABBCCDD20 MAC address wih the WZR-HP-AG300H router, on all the WZR-HP-G300NH&#039;s&nbsp; I have used their actual MAC Address which is stamped on the side of the router. Using the Backfire 10.03.1-RC5 I had not issues using LuCI out of the box, but with the Trunk editions, LuCI and SSH are NOT enabled out of the box. You will need to connect the router&#039;s WAN port to the internet and then do the following using a telnet session (or if you have already set the password using PASSWD on a telnet session, you will have to use SSH as telnet will be disabled).</p><p>LuCI installation Do:</p><p>1) opkg update</p><p> then for LuCI without HTTPS support </p><p>2) opkg install luci </p><p>and for LuCI with HTTPS support </p><p>3) opkg install luci-ssl</p><p>then continue with </p><p>4) /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br />5) /etc/init.d/uhttpd start<br />6) netstat -a<br />7) iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT -i eth0.1 -p tcp --dport 80<br />8) iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT -i eth0.1 -p tcp --dport 443 </p><p>You should now be able to connect with a webbrowser.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, that is common. Depending on which OS you are running, you might need to clear the ARP tables to resolve that as I have had to do in the past when flashing multiple routers together. Under Windows 7, you will need to run a Command Prompt as administrator and do an ARP -d to clear. Also, might want to disconnect from the router, making sure that you don&#039;t have any other wired or wireless connections active before connecting back to the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>WZR-HP-G300NH&nbsp; A2 A0 Openwrt installation guide for windows users Easiest way</p><p>UPDATE: Got cracking on OPENWRT and compiled a version (OpenWrt Firmware Attitude Adjustment (r28043) ) for this router with the web interface built in follow the instructions in file.<br /><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?niact3uvd3b0y25">http://www.mediafire.com/?niact3uvd3b0y25</a><br /> (see guide below <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=140742#p140742)">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 2#p140742)</a>&nbsp; and goto 192.168.1.1 to login and configure router and save yourself the headache.</p><p>Note:ALL credit goes to the openwrt team</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The only way I could get it to work was tftp this image to router but note you have to manually install the web interface and can only use the command line after you flash it.<br /><a href="http://158.108.8.148/openwrt/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-wzr-hp-g301nh-squashfs-tftp.bin">http://158.108.8.148/openwrt/snapshots/ â€¦ s-tftp.bin</a></p><p>1.Once you flash the image with tftp I use pumpKIN <a href="http://kin.klever.net/pumpkin">http://kin.klever.net/pumpkin</a><br />because it&#039;s more reliable, after about 4 min telnet to router I use <br />putty <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a><br />then change the password with the command <br />passwd</p><p>2.now shh into router after setting your IP address back to obtain automatically and plug a network cable into the WAN port that is internet enabled, go to point 3 if you need to get a ppoe connection going first <br />go to point 2.5</p><p>2.5 You can edit the config file easily on the router and get your ppoe connection if your using a bridged modem by using WinSCP&nbsp; <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">http://winscp.net/eng/index.php</a><br /> just connect to the router with winSCP and ensure file protocol &quot;SCP&quot; is selected, navigate to<br />/ect/config/</p><p>right Click on &quot;network&quot; and choose edit<br />you will see a line like this edit the&nbsp; username and password lines and ensure all other lines are the same then reboot your router</p><p>config &#039;interface&#039; &#039;wan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ifname&#039; &#039;eth1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;username&#039; &#039;myusername&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;password&#039; &#039;mypassword&#039;</p><p>Now you internet should be up you will be able to install luci (the web interface)</p><br /><p>3.ssh into router L:root and the password you chose in point 1</p><p>4.Enter these commands to install the web interface.</p><p>opkg update<br />opkg install luci-ssl<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start<br />netstat -a<br />iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT -i eth0.1 -p tcp --dport 80<br />iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT -i eth0.1 -p tcp --dport 443<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable</p><p>Ok now the web interface is installed and you can simply login at 192.168.1.1 in your web browser.</p><p>Works great on my WZR-HP-G300NH&nbsp; A2 A0</p><p>Then in the web browser you probably want to go into the software tab and click update.<br />then choose luci upnp to install upnp for windows then go to services tab choose unpnp and click enable<br />then choose luci qos&nbsp; &nbsp;to get Quality of service running go to network tab and choose qos to set it up.</p><p>Now your router has the features common on most commercial routers, but is very stable.

					<p>WZR-HP-G300NH TFTP flashing and recovery guide for windows 7</p><p>Before flashing any firmware write down your routers MAC address!! looks like this 4C-E6-76-3F-2F-CA It should be written on the box mine is just a set of numbers like this 4CE6763F2FCA with no spaces</p><p>1.Download pumpKIN <a href="http://kin.klever.net/pumpkin">http://kin.klever.net/pumpkin</a> save you wasting time with tftp and the&nbsp; command line</p><p>2.Unplug all the ethernet cable and the power cable and connect the computer directly to the router(still leave it off)</p><p>3.Go to Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections in win7 <br />right click on local area connection and choose &quot;properties&quot;<br />choose &quot;internet protocol version 4&quot;<br />click properties then click &quot;use the following ip address&quot;&nbsp; <br />Enter these values:<br />IP address 192.168.11.2, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, default gateway192.168.11.1</p><p>4.then turn off firewall go to Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Centre click on windows firewall then<br />choose &quot;turn windows firewall on or off&quot; then click on every &quot;turn windows firewall off&quot; box.</p><p>5.Open a Windows command prompt as Administrator. type cmd in the search box from Start menu, then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. You will be prompted with the User Account Control dialogue choose yes. OR just right click on CMD and choose run as administrator.<br />Type the command <br />route print <br />to get a list of your NIC(s). Write down the interface number for the LAN card, in my case, it&#039;s 11, you may need to scroll up. mine is the first one &quot;Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller&quot;</p><p>6.Now type the command below to get the ARP binding(thanks ermax at DD-WRT forum):<br />Replacing the number 11 with the interface number and 00-1d-12-34-56-78 with the router&#039;s MAC address.</p><p>netsh interface ipv4 add neighbors 11 192.168.11.1 4C-E6-76-3F-2F-CA</p><p>Eg: if your adaptor was no 10 and your mac address is 00:00:00:00:00 it would be <br />netsh interface ipv4 add neighbours 10 192.168.11.1 00-00-00-00-00-00</p><p>7.Run pumpKIN utility choose &quot;Put File&quot;</p><p>8.Put 192.168.11.1 as remote host, local File is the firmware file you want to flash openwrt or (usually Buffalo &quot;friendly firmware&quot; for a recovery).</p><p>9.Click &quot;ok&quot; and quickly plug the power cable into the back to turn on the router. (within a few seconds)</p><p>10.keep repeating point 9. until you see the file upload usually takes me three attempts.</p><p>11. leave router with power plugged in for at least 6 min for friendly firmware to install, it can take a while. the open ddwrt firmware only takes about 4 min.<br />When the upgrade is done. </p><p>12 repeat point 3 but choose obtain ip address automatically and ensure &quot;obtain dns address automatically&quot; is enabled in your adaptor so the router can be seen once the new firmware is active Navigate to <a href="http://192.168.11.1">http://192.168.11.1</a>(for stock firmware) to configure your router. OR for openwrt <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> see above post&nbsp; for basic config</p><p>13.Turn your firewall back on</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bcmalloy</strong> on 23 Aug 2011, 08:52)</p>

					<p>#bcmalloy</p><p>I seem to be having the same issue with the WZR-HP-G300NH when trying to change to open wrt. My router does not say A2 A0 though, it reads A2 F0B instead. I have tried to load both the generic wzr-hp... version of open wrt and the&nbsp; one you so kindly supplied at <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?p41tesaa95ogki8">http://www.mediafire.com/?p41tesaa95ogki8</a>. </p><p>I am able to get the firmware to write to the router ( i am using a linksys tftp client - linksys tftp 1.2.1) but once the new firmware is written to the router I am unable to access it through telnet, ssh or through my web browser. I am able to use the same tftp client to write the Buffalo DD-WRT firmware back to the router and have everything work out. </p><p>When I do get the open wrt firmware written to the flash memory the router restarts itself, then gives me a red diag led every two seconds for a while, then it turns solid red for a while, then the router led flashes for a while, then finally the router light stays solid. </p><p>And ideas?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Rambot</p>									</div>
