					<p>I have TP-Link 1043ND. <br />The options are:<br />Download Factory image if you want to install OpenWrt on router with OEM firmware.<br />Download Update image if you already have OpenWrt installed.</p><p>I dont know why i decide to put the &quot;Update image&quot; on my OEM Firmware, (i had to install the factory OpenWrt firmware), But because i am an idiot, i put the &quot;Update image&quot; on my OEM firmware. Now the router is fine (according the LEDs) but i cant access the openwrt WebUI.</p><p>Is there any solution for my issue?</p>									</div>
