					<p>Hello,</p><p>testing 12.09-rc1 I had quite a problem to gain access to the internet. This came from my &quot;old&quot; 10.03 knowledge that only the &quot;WAN masquerade&quot; option is neccessary. The difference between the two versions is:</p><p>10.03 does not make use of notrack option <br />12.09 activates notrack option on every interfaces that has no masquerading flag</p><p>If you want to setup LAN-&gt;WAN routing via LUCI this means for newer builds that you have to enable MASQUERADE also on the LAN interface. With this option connection tracking is active and the important rule &quot;MASQUERADE on WAN interface&quot; is applied. That is no problem at all if you connect your local LAN with the internet. But what about two LANs? You cannot enable masquerading only in one direction it must always be for both directions. At least you can fix that with editing the config files option conntrack manually.</p><p>Is this desired by design or schould I open a ticket?</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>

					<p>I can&#039;t verify this behaviour at all, I never had to enable masquerading on lan in order to have proper nat on wan.<br />You can also enable the conntrack flag in LuCI, no need to manually edit files.</p>									</div>

					<p>What you describe can happen if ...<br />1) the default enabled drop_invalid option is disabled<br />... and ...<br />2) no &quot;config forwarding&quot; section exists between lan and wan<br />.. in this case the &quot;need conntrack&quot; property of &quot;wan&quot; is not propagated to &quot;lan&quot;.</p><p>If this applies to your config you can cure it by setting the conntrack flag on the lan zone.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you, that did the trick.</p><p>Maybe I missed something but the drop_invalid option is not enabled at all by default. I just flashed a DIR-825 with D-LINK stock firmware. Additionally last week I installed an Virtualbox image and same settings there. Release was 12.09-rc1 both times.</p><p>Markus</p>									</div>
