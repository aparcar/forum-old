					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am NOT an network guy but I have a challenge. I have 2 TL3600,&#039;s set up as 5 ports switches. I have a 3-in-1 box from my ISP (Telephone, Interactive TV and Internet) that I must use. It provides DHCP I cannot turn off. From the closet where this 3-in-1 box is, there is one ethernet cable going to the living room and one going to the addict. I want one TL3600 in the living room and one in the addict. So, the physical network is like this:</p><p>Internet ---- [3-in-1 box] ====== 2 x [TL3600]</p><p>What I want is:<br />1. Getting into the 2 TL3600 using both web and ssh from any port and wireless on all TL3600&#039;s and from the Internet<br />2. Devices on the ports and a trusted wireless ESSID must be a broadcast domain (one VLAN)<br />3. A wireless guest network with limited bandwidth and access to Internet only.</p><p>Remember the 3-in-1 box has a DHCP service I cannot turn off, but it&#039;s reach could be limited to the uplink ports on the TL3600. I would prefer to use DHCP from OpenWRT, because then I have more control over the DHCP options and such.</p><p>The main thing is I don&#039;t know how to make a single broadcast domain spanning the 2 switches with the 3-in-1 in between.</p><p>Help!</p>									</div>

					<p>The thing you are probably looking for is called the &quot;dumb ap&quot;, just google the recipe ;-) Openwrt behaves as 5 port switch with wifi.</p><p>If you set the same ssid, encryption and key, but different channel on all the routers, you can benefit from roaming, your phone or any other wireless device picks the one with best signal as you move around the house or even garden.</p>									</div>
