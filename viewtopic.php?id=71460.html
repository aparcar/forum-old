Then upgrade to a newer FW and clear the existing config. Now manually paste over those bits from the old config that you need.</p><p>Usually the config files are compatible between versions, but sometimes new things have been added and old things refactored so that the config files simply aren&#039;t compatible.</p>									</div>
