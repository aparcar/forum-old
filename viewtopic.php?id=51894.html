					<p>Does anyone have any experience working with Hughes Satellite based ISP?</p><p>chris5560 has written some new scripts for IPv6 DDNS, you can view the thread here:&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50908">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50908</a></p><p>I&#039;ve been trying to do testing for him, but we&#039;ve run into a problem.&nbsp; It appears as if my Hughesnet Gen4 HT-1000 modem caches DNS.&nbsp; Right after booting the HT-1000, I can querry DNS and get a correct response.&nbsp; Everytime after that, the information returned is the same as the first querry, even though the actual information has changed.&nbsp; The only way I can get the new information, is to reboot the modem.</p><p>Can someone confirm that the modem does actually cache the information?&nbsp; Does anyone know how to stop this behavior or bypass it?</p><p>Thanks,<br />Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>In case some one else comes up against this problem.<br />According to this post:<br /><a href="https://community.myhughesnet.com/hughesnet/topics/ht1000_dns_cache_caches_bad_responses">https://community.myhughesnet.com/hughe â€¦ _responses</a></p><p>The Hughes HT-1000 modem is intercepting DNS querries and reporting answers as if they come from the server specified, but actually come from the cache within the modem.&nbsp; It appears that if you send the request via TCP, you get an accurate response from the actual server, bypassing the Hughes&#039; modem cache.</p>									</div>
