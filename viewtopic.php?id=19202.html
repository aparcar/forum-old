					<p>Ok, I&#039;ve read on various places, that I will not be able to use the wireless stuff on my wrt54gl with the 2.6 kernel. However I believe I&#039;ve also read somewhere, that by now I can get it working when I install some special packages. Unfortunately I cannot find that page again. My Webif (x-wrt) asked me to install a package (NAS or so?) to have WPA2-PSK work. I did that. I configured my wireless network, but I cannot connect to it. Though I activated ESSID broadcast I cannot find my network, even if I&#039;m right beside the box. The WLAN LED on the router isn&#039;t flashing either.</p><p>Is there &quot;native&quot; wireless supprt in 8.09 with 2.6 kernel? Is there support for it at all? Have I done something wrong?</p><p>Edit: Of course I have a wRt54gl, sorry.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>dev0</strong> on 4 Mar 2009, 19:22)</p>

					<p>You need at least kmod-b43 and hostapd-mini (they should be included in the 2.6 image now, but I&#039;m not sure). But you should not use 8.09 for that, if you want your wireless to be usable, use a snapshot or build it for yourself from trunk.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just bought a WGT54GL(EU) v1.1, and would like to install openwrt on it. ;-)<br />1) Should I choose Kamikaze 8.09 ? <br />2) On page <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRT54GL">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ys/WRT54GL</a> , in Installation paragraph, it says that I should install version 2.4 kernel before I attempt to install a 2.6, in order to be able to set nvram parameters.&nbsp; But I&#039; am not sure which one is the file for the version 2.4 kernel. In folder <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm-2.4/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/brcm-2.4/</a> , I can see a file openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx, is that the one I should upgrade to, first?<br />I need your help as I am not new in linux (I am a gentoo user),&nbsp; but I am new to embedded and openwrt.<br />Thanks. ;-)</p>									</div>

					<p>aggman: actually, all the files in brcm-2.4 are the same image, except the .bin files have an additional header to make the gui of the device recognize it as a valid firmware upgrade. So, if you&#039;re upgrading from the original linksys firmware, you should use &quot;openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin&quot; under brcm-2.4. Also, you might wanna stick with 2.4 for now, or upgrade to a recent snapshot, because the broadcom driver in the 2.6 version of 8.09 is unstable.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRT54GL chipset is actually BCM5352, which is code compatible with the older BCM47xx (WRT54G v3.x and older). That&#039;s why there&#039;s no need for a separate target. BCM43xx is the wireless chip itself. Anyway, trust me, bcm47xx works on WRT54GL <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>It is just an enquiry on 2.6 kernel usage and Broadcom 43XX chipset to crack WEP and WPA encryption of wifi networks.</p><p>You know the aircrack team issued a new version aircrack-ng 1.0 rc3 a few weeks ago. I have an intention to run the aircrack-ng application on my wrt54gl to crack some WEP and WPA encription based wifi networks. To reach my goal I need to accomplish packet-injection of the wifi traffic. To accomlish packet-injection to the network traffic I have to use additionally the b43 driver.</p><p>My exact idea regarding to the software architecture is that the WRT54GL will sniff the wifi traffic, run the aircrack-ng server application plus send the packets to a laptop which will run the aircrack-ng client application. The crack will be done on the laptop.</p><p>The chipset what the wifi router contains is Broadcom BCM5352, which is exactly the Broadcom 4318 with 802.11 PHY.</p><p>The aircrack-ng application needs at leat 2.6.26 linux kernel. The last issued and stable kernel what OpenWrt is suggest is&nbsp; 2.4. What would you say if I ask you on the 2.6 kernel based openwrt firmware publication? Please suggest me a solution. Every piece of information is well appreciated. Thank you for your effort.</p>									</div>
