					<p>I am trying to work through some issues with odhcp6c/OpenWRT IPv6 lifetime cycle, and I was hoping someone here might have ideas.</p><p>The initial problem was that when using odhcp6c (Wide-DHCPv6 works as expected), the prefix delegation would change frequently.&nbsp; There appear to be two issues.</p><p>1)&nbsp; On a clean reboot of the router the prefix would change.&nbsp; The root cause here is that odhcp6c sends a RELEASE message on a clean shutdown telling the dhcp server to terminate the lease (removing the RELEASE send appears to correct this issue).</p><p>2)&nbsp; The prefix delegation would suddenly change, which would disconnect clients until they aged out addresses.&nbsp; This issue appears to be caused by a failure in the RENEW/REBIND messaging.&nbsp; It appears that, when T1 is up both a RENEW and REBIND are sent but there is no indication that they receive a valid reply.&nbsp; odhcp6c then goes through the SOLICIT/REQUEST logic and receives back the same addresses, but the timers are not reset (this appears to be server behavior) and continue to count down.&nbsp; Eventually they will hit zero.&nbsp; In my case, the ISP&nbsp; sets valid lifetime equal to preferred lifetime so there is no grace period, the address and PD just expire.</p><br /><p>I will try to grab a packet capture of the next renew cycle, but are there any other suggestions on further things to investigate?</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your feedback I just commited a fix to OpenWrt (<a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/35902">https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/35902</a>) which should address your issues.</p><p>It seems I had an upper limit for T1 and T2 still in the client which was 1 day, capping your ISPs provided T1 and T2 values at that time and thus causing the premature RENEW / REBIND / RELEASE all at the same time.</p><p>I also added a UCI-option &quot;norelease&quot; for proto dhcpv6 which disables the sending of the RELEASE-message.</p><p>I hope that fixes your issue.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, I will give it a try.&nbsp; Would the timer issue have caused the RENEW/REBIND to not be sent to the DHCP server?&nbsp; I find it curious that they did not appear in the packet capture.</p><p>Thanks again!</p>									</div>
