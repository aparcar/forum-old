					<p>Don&#039;t short the flash, you&#039;ll just make things worse than they already are.</p><p>When running the linksys firmware, you can hold the reset button to reset it to defaults</p><p>While the linksys firmware is running, it&#039;s also running a tftp server included within the linksys fw; this is a password protected tftp server which differs from the tftp server available for a few seconds before the firmware boots. Our documentation refers to the tftp server before the firmware boots, although it is possible to use the tftp server within the linksys firmware, you just need to find a linksys tftp client.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey Thanks!<br />I thought I had tried resets before but this time it worked.&nbsp; I was able to reload openwrt from<br />the linksys web i/f.&nbsp; OK, back to square one.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to play around (carefully) some more.</p><p>hostage</p>									</div>
