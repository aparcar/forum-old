					<p>Not sure if this is possible, but here goes.&nbsp; I use a Draytek Vigor 2130 which is based on OpenWRT.</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/vigor2130/">http://code.google.com/p/vigor2130/</a></p><p>It is actually a very good and powerful router with hardware NAT.&nbsp; So far I have only used the web GUI, but there is more powerful configuration available via the CLI.</p><p>Is it possible to intercept a domain when accessed from the LAN side of my router and redirect it to a server on the LAN?&nbsp; For example, when I am on the internet at large outside my LAN I would like mydomain.com to get me to my local network at home.&nbsp; However, when behind the LAN, accessing mydomain.com goes outside and back in again, resulting in slower-than-necessary pings.&nbsp; This is not ideal for VoIP applications.</p><p>Is OpenWRT capable of redirecting mydomain.com to an internal IP address?&nbsp; I do not have a static external IP, so cannot use a static route to accomplish this, I think.</p><p>Lifespeed</p>									</div>

					<p>Sorry about the slow reply, got sucked into some issues with Verizon Wireless interfering with SIP traffic to my asterisk server via a SIP proxy server that apparently exists to disrupt traffic.</p><p>Anyway, I am back to looking at this issue.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I have a great desire to run DNS server in this router.&nbsp; Is that a requirement to intercept requests to mypbx.org and route them locally?&nbsp; I did try and read your suggestions, but may not have found the exact page.</p><p>Any more suggestions or links?</p>									</div>
