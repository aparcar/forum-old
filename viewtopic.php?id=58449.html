					<p>Help! Following the youtube video( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmTv3ONy8Og)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmTv3ONy8Og)</a> to install OpenWrt ChaosCalmer on my TPL-Link WR841N V9, I am unable to proceed after 3:21 of the video. The problem is, as many viewers have pointed out, is there is not WAN. </p><br /><p>How do I restore back to original TPL-Link firmware? I have tried tftp as follows:</p><p>Windows</p><p>DD-WRT tftp GUI<br />Server is the IP address of your bootloader tftp server( in my case, i have it set to 192.168.1.1 address of the router)<br />Password is typically blank<br />Select the firmware file<br />Set retries to 20 or more (most of the time you get it in 3)<br />Click on Upgrade and it will constantly retry until it gets it<br />Windows 2000 and Windows XP have a built-in TFTP client and it can be used to flash with OpenWrt firmware.<br />tftpd32 from <a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/philippe.jounin/tftpd32.html">http://perso.wanadoo.fr/philippe.jounin/tftpd32.html</a></p><p>But it&#039;s giving up without sucess</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>terminator1000</strong> on 12 Jul 2015, 05:42)</p>

					<p>i can&#039;t see the video, but CC (Chaos Calmer) does not include LuCi (web interface) and a 841 has a small flash space, do not make the mistake of using Stock firmware from Tp-Link or you will brick your router, the easiest, is to reflash Sysupgrade file from the BB (Barrier Braker ) Files<br />Here&#039;s a similar situation to yours, don&#039;t pay attention to the tittle, Im sure you are not bricked and Apply it to your model <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56474">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=56474</a> you need to read all the post, and decide if you use WinScp or you Download the file from <br />Dont forget the. linked is for a 741 router you are 841</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your reply. I tried to copy the Barrier Breaker bin file to the router in order to perform sysupgrade. However, as you said, 841 has small flash space and the router runs out of space before the bin file is copied completly, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dnWvUGfUmRvDpL9tDLsyYSfxQAbXbSjGTb5-okbbD_M/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dnW â€¦ sp=sharing</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>terminator1000</strong> on 13 Jul 2015, 00:58)</p>
