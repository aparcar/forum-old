					<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>I&#039;ve got a question.<br />I&#039;m a newbie with my firmware for my Linksys WRT54GL, OpenWRT Kamikaze 7.09<br />I want to use my router to get the wifi signal from my neighbour (i&#039;&#039;ve got permission).<br />The intention is to get the wifi signal with WEP key and to distribute it in my network.</p><p>The information that i got from my neighbour:<br />- The mac adress from his router<br />- The IP adres from the router<br />- The WEP key</p><p>What are the steps to get it right? Or is it impossible?<br />The outer router is a different brand.<br />Without WDS.</p><p>Sorry for my broken English!<br />Thanks for the help!</p><p>Kind regarts,</p><p>Erwin</p>									</div>
