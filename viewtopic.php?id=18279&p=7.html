					<p>I registered a profile on this forum, just to say thanks to the people behind this. I used these images and was able to get OpenWRT up and running on my WNR2000v1, which I should add was lying around without any use. Looking forward to tweaking around with the settings.</p><p>Just wanted to added a few points:<br />1. For people who cant get their WNR2000v1 connected to the internet before using the following commands for whatever reason, I would recommend downloading these files separately on a different machine connected to the internet, host it on a local FTP server and download this files using ftpget instead of snarf. <br />2. I might be wrong here but since the amount of space left after flashing with this firmware is extremely minimal, there is very limited scope to install any opkg packages. As such, this might not be really required as WNR2000v1 has no USB support and so torrent clients, media server etc are of no use. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p><p>Thanks again. Will use the router for sometime and post any updates that I might have. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>radengr wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I just flashed my WNR2000v1 with Backfire 10.03.1 final.

					<p>If someone is interested in, I made a bash script which stores the router&#039;s data in a virtualized ftp server, in such manner that you can see if the upload is well happened and if the files are good (with an md5 checksum).<br />You can easily adapt it in order to flash the router in one step, however I doubt that I will post any kind of script which could brick your WNR2000 in a forum.<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

					<p>Hi, i&#039;d like to thank everyone for their great work on openwrt on the WNR2000v1. Sadly, i think i might have bricked my router.<br />&nbsp; I was originally able to install openwrt via the non partition method and it worked perfectly fine. However, i decided to try the partition method and that is where i ran into trouble. I followed all the commands are directed and was able to log in to 192.168.1.1 even though it seems that the dhcp and wireless were not working. After trying to enable dhcp and saving the setting i tried to re-enter via 192.168.1.1 and thats where the issue started. i have tried to access it via telnet with no luck. i tried pinging the addresses and all i get are time out connections. i tried using tftp to restore the original firmware but with no luck either. the lights on the front of the device seem to be normal, none of them are stuck on on. Is there any hope for this router, or am i just gonna have to use it as a paperweight.</p><p>thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>You may be able to unbrick the router with a serial cable. There are a lot of informations about this in the forum, and even in this topic. I won&#039;t pollute it by repeating all the stuff but if you want me to help you, I answered you.

					<p>Has anybody succesfully connected to WN2000RPT&#039;s telnet interface after using telnetenable? Based on wiki, WN2000RPT is supposed to be v0 of WNR2000 and telnetenable should work with it.
