					<p>Hello,</p><p>I have an embedded PC, booting from a flash card and I installed the Kamikaze x86 branch on it.<br />However, the card is 256 MB and Kaimkaze uses only about 20 MB so I would like to make another partition from the remaining space and format it with jffs2.<br />I made the partition but I can&#039;t find a format utility for jffs2.<br />What tool does that and where can I get it ?</p><p>Thanks !</p>									</div>

					<p>jffs2 is useful and can be used only with embedded flash devices, not with regular CF, SD and other flash cards. Those have builtin their own wear levelling management.<br />If you want to increase the size of your (ext2?) image, you can do this with &quot;make menuconfig&quot; - Target Images - select ext2 - file system part size<br />If you want to create another partition on the flash card, you can do this with fdisk, and format it with ext2 or ext3 with mkfs.ext2 or mkfs.ext3 respectively.<br />You may have to install kmod-fs-ext3 and e2fsprogs.</p>									</div>
