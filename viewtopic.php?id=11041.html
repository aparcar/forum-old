					<p>I flashed Kamikaze to my Buffalo WHR-G54S and installed Chillispot. I know that Chilli need its own firewall so I replace the original firewall file with chilli firewall. Unfortunately when I reboot my AP, I found I cannot access AP....even I cannot ping it...&nbsp; I pressed the reset button for many times, but it&#039;s useless....</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, I did have the some problem, yesterday.<br />I think the firewall conf. was the problem.<br />My solution was reflash the device.<br />You can try it if boot_wait is on.<br />Maybe yoy donÂ´t want do that, because you will lost lot of job.<br />You can try falisafe mode too.<br />Good luck.</p>									</div>
