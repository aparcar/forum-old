					<p>1) No problem to have two dataentry pages for different annex support. In fact, this is the clean way, which hasn&#039;t been applied for some devices (information unknown at that time or other reasons) in the past.<br />2) All versions on one page is what we can see for several devices. To be honest, it does not make things clearer if the models have different SoC.<br />My proposal would be to put different hardware on different pages, and to create a separate overview page (if needed) to explain the differences of the models.<br />- Overview page: show all models for comparison, do not include model specific installation procedures here<br />- Model specific page: Explain model specific installation procedure.</p><p>In case of different annexes only (same SoC), there&#039;s nothing against having them on the same page, since the installation procedure will not differ.</p>									</div>
