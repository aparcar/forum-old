					<p>After I had successfully installed openwrt on this router, I was eager to see if there was a builtin qos functionality, but sadly there wasn&#039;t. So I searched for available packages and tried to install qos-scripts, but due to the limited disk space on the router, I wasn&#039;t able to proceed further. I wasn&#039;t able to install it. Same goes for luci-app-qos/wshaper, not enough free space.. Without any more luck after a few hours of searching, I decided to just revert the router back to its original firmware because it has builtin qos. But the process also requires that you put the stock firmware onto the tmp directory on the router to be able to flash it, and then again, the router has insufficient disk space. (4mb flash)</p><p>Can someone please point me in the right direction?<br />I had several options in mind:<br />A) What packages can i safely remove from the default installation of openwrt? So that I can install qos-scripts without any more trouble..<br />B) Can I build a custom openwrt image wherein it only has the basic features I want, and also integrate qos into it?<br />C) If all else fails, can someone just teach me how to flash the router back to its original firmware?</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.. I just want QoS on my network so bad <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>chir0n</strong> on 1 Sep 2014, 14:25)</p>

					<p>@nebbia88: Are you seriously suggesting installing packages into /tmp?</p><p>@OP: You can&#039;t remove packages from images, the compressed file system would only mark them as deleted but not free up the actual space. Also, you probably need all the packages to have a fully functional router on the edge of your own infrastructure. You can try extending the memory (through extroot) or create your own image (through a custom build or imagebuilder, to have additional packages compressed so they might fit). Both options have been extensively discussed here in the forums.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 31 Aug 2014, 22:10)</p>

Those are general guides based on similar TP-Link models. Sometimes you need a specific LAN or WAN port.

					<p>Yes, this is stripped firmware from tp-link.com the official one. In dd-wrt forum my account is TendaW311R+ so if you need help just write here. You can also download the archive from openwrt forum in Tp-link tl-wr841n v9 topic. It&#039;s the same archive with instructions. I tested to revert from openwrt/ddwrt to stock and works any time <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
