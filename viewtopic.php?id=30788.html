Is the computer your forwarding the port to set to a static IP address? Does the computer have a firewall? If so, have you made an exception to allow incoming communications on that port?</p><p>Looks like your configuration is setup properly -- I would maybe remove the UDP from the protocol -- but that&#039;s about it.</p>									</div>

					<p>Client is set statically via the router and I confirmed it has the correct address.&nbsp; No firewall running and it worked prior to swapping out my Cisco 871W to my Alix2D3 and again just a few minutes ago when I put the 871W back in for a few minutes to test.&nbsp; Removing UDP did not seem to make a difference.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well I&#039;m not sure what I did to fix it since I made a pretty basic build to begin with, but I added a few packages for some various services (multiwan, ddns and a few others) and the forwarding seems to work now on this new build I made.</p>									</div>
