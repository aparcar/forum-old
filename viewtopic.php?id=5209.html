					<p>I often travel on business to a place where my OpenWrt box can only get a signal from one end of the hotel room.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it&#039;s a very bad place to have the laptop, so I figure I can either string a long ethernet cable across the room and gather it up each morning, or I can come up with a situation wherein the laptop connects to the router wirelessly, and the router acts as a client to the upstream hotspot.&nbsp; Actually, I see a third possibility of traveling with two routers connected via cable- one acting as client and the other acting as server.</p><p>I&#039;m curious if any of these new-fangled router boxes with multiple antennae can work with two wireless networks- one as client and the other as server, with firewall and routing between.</p><p>I&#039;d feel more comfortable using routing rather than bridging if at all possible, so I don&#039;t much like the idea of WDS.</p><p>Also, I thought that I read on here that for WDS to work, the upstream router has to support it.&nbsp; I know that&#039;s not going to happen in this situation.</p><p>So I see the most straightforward situation is to carry a pair of Linksys WRT54GS boxes around, with a 12&quot; ethernet patch cord, and have one be the client to the internet hotspot and the other be the server to my laptop.&nbsp; A little clunky, but workable.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if there is a single box that can do the same thing.</p>									</div>

					<p>Get one of the openwrt compatible USB-enabled router boxen, and stick a random wifi stick in the usb port. Use the router as AP, and the usb as client.</p><p>Or find one of the ABG wrt compatible boxen with two mini pci cards, install two G cards and yeah.</p><p>--neg</p>									</div>
