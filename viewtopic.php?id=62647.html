					<p>Good luck to them. They have strong competition from at least two groups who are using OpenWrt as a base:</p><p>- Turris Omnia - ships April 2016. This is a cost-optimized version of an earlier router they produced, so they have a track record. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-omnia-hi-performance-open-source-router#/updates">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turr … r#/updates</a></p><p>- WiTi Router from mqmaker.com, shipping now. Version 1 sold out; version 2 &quot;on the way after the Chinese new year&quot;. There are several builds of OpenWrt available. See the WiTi Router Board page on the OpenWrt wiki <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/mqmaker/witiplatform#/updates">https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/mqmaker/wi … m#/updates</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>richbhanover</strong> on 11 Feb 2016, 23:37)</p>
