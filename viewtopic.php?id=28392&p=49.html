Then change the router in .config.init to the correct one and possible check filenames in the .sh build scripts (as they seek WNDR* files in some cases). And finally, check the ...openwrt.patch file that contains all the button modification etc. that I am doing. You will find all of those there. But none of those modifications should really hurt you with some other router. Merely some button in your other router may not work.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 26 Dec 2014, 21:54)</p>

Then change the router in .config.init to the correct one and possible check filenames in the .sh build scripts (as they seek WNDR* files in some cases).

But none of those modifications should really hurt you with some other router. Merely some button in your other router may not work.</p></blockquote></div><p>thank you. I found everything I need.<br/>The firmware I made, works perfectly (thanks to you, I did a wireless bridge between a WNDR3700 and AGPF). Now I have to figure out how to create a patch to fix the things in openwrt ... I have to send them to the community)</p><p>Bye, hitech95</p>									</div>
