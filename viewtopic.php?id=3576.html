					<p>Hey, fellow OpenWRT aficionados!&nbsp; Long time no post. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />&nbsp; Been pretty dang busy recently.</p><p>Here&#039;s a fun story for you all, though:</p><p>I was visiting my parents over Thanksgiving, and ended up shopping around the day after (Black Friday) to see what deals I could find.</p><p>One thing I was looking for was a cheap wireless AP or router for my parents&#039; home (broadband, but no wireless...a shame).&nbsp; Didn&#039;t need to be anything fancy...just something that would allow my dad (and myself, whenever I come to visit <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> ) to use his laptop without having to string a wire across the living room.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t even need to be a router, really...just a dumb AP would have been fine.&nbsp; CompUSA was opening at Midnight in our area, and advertised a CompUSA-branded 11g AP+router for US$2.99 after rebates ($60 before).</p><p>Well, I got there too late for that deal (all sold out 45 minutes after opening), but I found a whole stockpile of ViewSonic WR100s for $24.98, no rebates necessary.&nbsp; It was listed as a &quot;Manager&#039;s Special,&quot; so they were going to remain that price until they sold out.&nbsp; Apparently, it had nothing to do with Black Friday sales (it wasn&#039;t even listed in their BF circular)...ViewSonic was simply getting out of the networking hardware business (I never knew they got in it!), so CompUSA was trying to clear out their stock.</p><p>After shopping around on-line some and determining that this was as good a deal as I was going to find for a wireless router (esp. since I wouldn&#039;t have to wait for mail order), I went ahead and purchased one, not really knowing anything about the router itself.</p><p>When I got it home, naturally the first thing I did was open it up.&nbsp; And what do you think I found inside this unit?&nbsp; That&#039;s right: a BCM4712KPB CPU.&nbsp; Oh, and the usual ADMTek ethernet switch.&nbsp; And a very GemTek-esque model number sikscreened onto the PCB.&nbsp; Running the first 6 digits of the MAC address through the OUI database confirmed my suspicions: this was indeed OEM&#039;d from GemTek.&nbsp; (Interestingly, the FCC ID Grantee Code was assigned to ViewSonic directly, so they weren&#039;t just riding on GemTek&#039;s FCC certs.)&nbsp; This coupled with the very familiar-looking hardware inside probably indicated that it would be able to run OpenWRT with little work.</p><p>Based on my previous experience with Trendnet routers and GPIOs being different from what OpenWRT is accustomed to them being (http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=424, see last two posts), I custom-built a whiterussian RC4 image that excluded the diag kernel module and contained an /etc/preinit script edited to remove the loading of the module and the checking of the appropriate /proc devices for reset button presses (I didn&#039;t want to risk having my ethernet ports disabling themselves again...someday, I&#039;ll map out all the GPIO functions and figure out what GPIO the reset button on this unit is wired to so that fail-safe mode can work).&nbsp; I tried loading using the web interface upgrader in the ViewSonic firmware (and this worked when I tried it on the Trendnet), but no go...&quot;Error during upgrade&quot; every time I tried.&nbsp; The ViewSonic must have some specific custom header requirements like the Linksys ones, I&#039;m guessing.&nbsp; There is also no ping.asp bug to exploit on this model, nor is boot_wait enabled by default.&nbsp; Hmm.</p><p>I didn&#039;t want (nor did I have enough time) to solder a pin header on the JTAG cutout on the board, and my &quot;flash chip pin shorting&quot; days are well behind me now (see <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1418">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1418</a>, and last post of <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1522)">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=1522)</a>, so instead I took my JTAG cable that I made for my Trendnet, cut off the connector on the end, stripped the wires, put numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9 through the right holes on the JTAG interface on the board, bent the wires so that they were touching the exposed traces around the pin holes, and then stuck a bottle of Bacardi on top to keep the wires in place. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />&nbsp; I plugged the parallel port connector into my laptop, fired up HairyDairyMaid&#039;s flasher, and managed to extract the current NVRAM contents.&nbsp; Score!&nbsp; Working JTAG in 10 minutes. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />&nbsp; After I got NVRAM, I edited the &quot;boot_wait=off&quot; to read &quot;on,&quot; padded the end with an extra ASCII 255 to keep the size of the file the same, and then flashed the new NVRAM contents back over the JTAG.&nbsp; After rebooting the router, I confirmed it was accepting TFTP connections!</p><p>The last step was to send my OpenWRT image to it via TFTP.&nbsp; The router accepted the image, wrote it to flash, and 5 minutes later I was staring at an ash shell. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; After this, I installed nas and the new webif package and managed to configure it for WPA2 and have my dad&#039;s WinXP laptop associate to it.&nbsp; Slick, slick, slick.</p><p>All for US$25 + tax. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Most web retailers still seem to be selling the ViewSonic at retail ($70-80), and CompUSA&#039;s own site claims that they are completely out-of-stock and that they won&#039;t ship you one (and even then, CompUSA&#039;s site shows that their price is currently $71.99).&nbsp; But I imagine that we may be seeing the price come down on these things fairly soon, if our own local CompUSA store is any indication.</p><p>Have fun,</p><p>-- Nathan</p>									</div>

					<p>Further adventures with the ViewSonic WR100.</p><p>I have it set up to allow me to remotely-administer it.&nbsp; My dad was having trouble getting his card to work with WPA2 (installed the WinXP patch, and it sees it as a WPA2 access point, but when you try to connect or go in and add a network manually, there are no WPA2 options...I&#039;m guessing that we need to find some newer drivers for his WiFi card), so I tried setting it back to plain WPA-PSK+AES.&nbsp; This was when I ran into troubles:</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# nvram set wl0_akm=psk<br />root@OpenWrt:~# nvram commit<br />/dev/nvram: Cannot allocate memory</p><p>Uhhh, okay...(quick search through OpenWRT forum archives, Wiki, and even Google...nothing).</p><p>Let&#039;s see, for every &#039;nvram commit&#039; attempt, dmesg shows...:</p><p>__alloc_pages: 5-order allocation failed (gfp=0x1f0/0)<br />nvram_commit: out of memory</p><p>Odd.&nbsp; But, whoa, what is this?!:</p><p>Memory: 6192k/8192k available (1395k kernel code, 2000k reserved, 100k data, 80k init, 0k highmem)</p><p>Only 8MB of RAM?!?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Well, that sucks!&nbsp; It also surprises me that it would come with so little RAM since it has the full complement of flash (4MB).&nbsp; Is it possible that there really is 16MB of RAM but it is being limited somehow by NVRAM values (kind of like on the &quot;special&quot; WRT54G v2 rev. XH w/ 32MB)?&nbsp; Unfortunately, since the router is at my parents&#039; home 300 miles away, I cannot easily peak inside to look at the RAM chip(s) from here. ;-)</p><p>Here are my sdram values, for the curious:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# nvram show | grep sdram

sdram_config=0x0032

					<p>Well...here are the internal pics filed with the FCC (FCC ID of unit is GSS-VS10276):</p><p><a href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=455615&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/form … or_pdf=pdf</a></p><p>Sadly, although it is hard to read in that particular photo and to be completely sure, what I think I&#039;m reading off of the *single* SDRAM chip on the bottom of the board is:</p><p>ISSI IS42S32200B-6T</p><p>...which would be a 2M x 32 (== 64 / 8) == 8MiB part. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />&nbsp; Very limiting, and very disappointing.&nbsp; Thus, I would not recommend this unit for some of the more &quot;interesting&quot; projects that OpenWRT could be put to use on.</p><p>However, at $25, I still do not regret my purchase...with OpenWRT on it, it is still a more capable router than I could otherwise have gotten at that price. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />&nbsp; And if someone wanted to use this as a cheap 802.11b client/bridge/managed switch thingie instead of an AP/router, at $25 this is still a steal compared to something like the WET54GS5 @ around $150 or even the WET54G @ ~$80.</p><p>Another interesting factoid about this unit: NVRAM space also contains a *second* NVRAM section called &quot;NVRAM2.&quot;&nbsp; It seems to only contain a single variable...that of the ethernet MAC:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>NVRAM2 et0macaddr=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX</code></pre></div><p>It&#039;s at the very, very beginning of the NVRAM partition, before the &quot;FLSH&quot; header that designates the beginning of all of the &quot;official&quot; NVRAM stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing this is probably used by the version of CFE on this unit.</p><p>If anyone is interesting in dissecting CFE or the original ViewSonic firmware from this board (no firmware updates/downloads available from ViewSonic&#039;s web site, apparently), I did back them up before throwing OpenWRT on here, so I can send anyone who is interested a copy.</p><p>Anyway, to wrap this up, here are the board* NVRAM vars from this unit:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>root@OpenWrt:~# nvram show | grep board

					<p>Can someone help me out?

Viewsonic website does not have any firmware for download, maybe someone can supply one?</p></blockquote></div><p>Welllll...it&#039;s not that easy.&nbsp; See, the OpenWRT .BIN &quot;for Linksys&quot; firmware (and similarly with the &quot;for Motorola&quot; firmware) is exactly bit-for-bit the same as a TRX, save for a prepended &quot;custom&quot; header a few bytes long that the Linksys web firmware upload page uses.&nbsp; If you try to load the firmware via the Linksys firmware&#039;s web-based upgrader or via Linksys&#039;s TFTP server, the Linksys code checks for the presence and validity of the header.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t exist or doesn&#039;t match what it is expecting, then it rejects the file.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember off-hand (and the FAQ on openwrt.org should be able to confirm or deny this), but I think that Linksys&#039;s version of CFE (when upgrading using the boot_wait method) <em>also</em> checks for this header, so you can&#039;t just send a TRX to a Linksys router via TFTP to the bootloader, either.</p><p>This is ONLY used by Linksys (and Motorola) during the flash process to verify the file sent to it is, in fact, a valid firmware image.&nbsp; The header part is NOT ACTUALLY WRITTEN TO FLASH!&nbsp; It is stripped off by the Linksys firmware before being committed to flash ROM, so what ends up getting written is, in fact, just a normal TRX-formatted file.&nbsp; Once OpenWRT is on your Linksys or Motorola and has replaced the &quot;factory&quot; firmware, nothing is preventing you from performing further OpenWRT upgrades by using the TRX version <em>instead of</em> the BIN.&nbsp; In fact, there is really no way (except through Linksys CFE&#039;s TFTP) to use the BIN version <em>after</em> you have installed OpenWRT.&nbsp; If you were to upload the BIN file to the OpenWRT router, before you could write it to flash, you would be required to strip off the excess data and thus, in essence, &quot;convert&quot; the BIN to a TRX before flashing.</p><p>Because of this, you can see that we are in a slight bind: I may have managed to copy off the original ViewSonic firmware from my router before replacing it with OpenWRT, but because that BIN header (if one is even required for ViewSonic&#039;s WR100) doesn&#039;t actually reside on flash and is only used to verify &quot;image integrity&quot; during the upgrade process, my copy of the ViewSonic firmware doesn&#039;t HAVE any header on it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a plain TRX file.&nbsp; And, as you have discovered, ViewSonic never released either their original firmware image or an upgrade, so we may never know if there is something special that the ViewSonic firmware is looking for, or what it might be.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you can&#039;t try to dissect the WR100&#039;s CFE looking for clues, either, because as I demonstrated by merely modifying my NVRAM (through JTAG) to enable boot_wait, the WR100&#039;s CFE accepted a plain TRX file through TFTP without any grumbling, so at the very least, the version of CFE used by ViewSonic does NOT require a special firmware binary.</p><p>Nonetheless, for anyone who is interested or has any use for them, I have posted copies of the original ViewSonic WR100 firmware image, the WR100 CFE image, and my own build of RC4 (squashfs format) that I used on my WR100 on my web page: <a href="http://www.anderson-net.com/~nathan/blog/">http://www.anderson-net.com/~nathan/blog/</a>&nbsp; I merely ripped out diag.o from my version of RC4 in order to possibly avoid a problem on the WR100 like the one I encountered while trying to use OpenWRT on my Trendnet when diag.o&#039;s idea of &quot;which GPIO maps to what&quot; was in conflict with reality (see <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=424)">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=424)</a>.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little risky this way, since if you screw up something, you won&#039;t have the benefit of holding down RESET to enter failsafe, but at least you don&#039;t risk bricking your router on the first try. :-P&nbsp; (One of these days I&#039;ll get around to mapping out which GPIO on the ViewSonic is used for RESET and see if the stock diag.o works.)</p><p>If you&#039;d rather not try it without diag.o despite the risks associated with <em>that</em> action, then the default OpenWRT squashfs TRX should work fine...I made no other modifications to my version other than diag.o removal and related /etc/preinit hacking.</p><p>-- Nathan</p><p>P.S. -- Yay, DNS for openwrt.org is working tonight. :-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>NathanA</strong> on 10 Feb 2006, 11:34)</p>

					<p>Nathan:</p><p>I seem to be missing some pixie dust or something....</p><p>I have a WR100 (a couple oif them, actually) and I have been waging a mighty battle to get one of them to accept OpenWRT.... - the second one is still shrink-wrapped.</p><p>Fist, I soldered a JTAG header on, made a JTAG cable, and downloaded the NVRAM.&nbsp; Changed boot_wait=off to boot_wait=on, padded the end of the nvram file with FF, and wrote it back to the WR100.</p><p>Then I set up tftp, and sent the rc5 image over.&nbsp; Everything seemed to have gone OK; no error messages, and I left it long enough to boot up.&nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#039;t look like it was rebooting, but then again, I don&#039;t know anything about this router....</p><p>What happens is the box boots, requests and gets its IP address from DHCP, but then becomes unresponsive....</p><p>I&#039;ve now tried your rc4 image, my own self-compiled rc5r with diag removed, and the stock rc5, and *all* exhibit the same behavior.....&nbsp; I even reflashed the wr100 with the original nvram jus to make sure that&#039;s not screwing it up....</p><p>Just today I ordered a max233a chip so I can make serial cables to see what is going on...&nbsp; It &#039;feels&#039; as if the routing in the box is messed up; like perhaps the it&#039;s trying to send packets out some other interface than it received them...&nbsp; Or it is changing its IP after it gets it assigned via DHCP...</p><p>In the meantime, I would appreciate any suggestions.</p>									</div>

					<p>I just picked up a WR100 for $2.73 ~ needed a power supply (ho-hum) ~ no previous knowledge of this unit, never even heard of it but some sort of little bell went off and I did the &quot;at this price, how can I go wrong&quot; bit. Saw NathanA&#039;s post and decided to give it a shot. No results yet - just got the puppy running.<br />It is somewhat power sensitive - which was a surprise. First 12v unit lit it up but all the leds STAYED on. Hmmm. Tried 6v unit with the same result. Then I pulled the power brick off an old Linksys and voila - lights, cameras, action.<br />Then I discovered the WR100 has bridge mode. That&#039;s exactly what I wanted. So - I think I&#039;ll flash my old (broken down) Motorola WE800 bridge first and after that success return to the viewsonic.<br />Stay tuned but don&#039;t hold your breath. :-)</p>									</div>
