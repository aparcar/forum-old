					<p>Hi,</p><p>The WZR-HP-G300NH page at: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h</a> describes the device as: &quot;Quite possibly the best gigabit-capable router that OpenWrt runs on at this point.&quot;</p><p>Is that still true? - is the WZR-HP-G300NH the best hardware to run OpenWRT on at a reasonable price?</p><p>Are there any problems with it?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Ian</p>									</div>

					<p>WZR-HP-G300NH is great but it lacks dual-band wifi and there are some slightly faster Atheros devices available. I use it where price is more important than all the features.<br />If speed really matters, I go for a Netgear WNDR3700 (680MHz and dual-band WIFI).</p>									</div>

					<p>The best of the best is Netgear DGND3700! It has ADSL, Gigabit Lan, Dual Band wifi, 2 usb ports, 128 MB flash, 128 MB ram, dual core 400 Mhz CPU. Unfortunately is still unsupported by Openwrt and still a little expensive (~150â‚¬)!</p>									</div>
