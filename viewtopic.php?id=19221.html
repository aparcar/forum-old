					<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Having some problems with a console cable built from a DKU-5.. My RX works fine and can see the WGT634U rebooting every 5 seconds, but I can&#039;t seem to get decent output from the TX strand. Connecting the two together gives some pretty wacky output on my console screen, although I do occasionally get the correct characters echo&#039;d back to me after a bit of fiddling.</p><p>Does anyone have any tips to overcome this? I&#039;ve tried stripping back some of the insulation around the RX flex in case the wire was a bit dirty, but it&#039;s not made any difference.</p><p>Any tips or hints much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>									</div>
