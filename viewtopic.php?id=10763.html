					<p>Hi im wondering if there a known bug or anything where your password gets changed if the router reboots or something.. im asking this cause I have about 7 routers where I set the same user/pass on and sshed and everything no problem, now I havent touched this router for about 6months and i came back to use them and on every single one of them im having passwords problem it wont accept my password on ssh or via web now i could swear&nbsp; %100 i set them all as (user=root pass=root) and I cant seem to login to now to any of em, so Im just wondering am I only one having this problem?t hanks regards,</p><p>now I know people are gonna think ok this guys a dumbass who just forgot his password but no like I said im like %100 sure I remeber I used root/root as the default user/pass very insecure and i remeber entering it and using it so im wondering if like the password gets reset after a long time maybe cause of a reboot or something? (I always dont have access to the router anymore because my laptop was stolen a long time ago and I have no wireless card so remote access is my only option so resetting the router is out the window.. im just baffled at this..)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>lynx9595</strong> on 16 May 2007, 06:35)</p>

					<p>Umm... Are you sure that someone didn&#039;t just hack your routers? I mean, that&#039;s the lamest, most easy to guess username/password combo you could have setup. If anyone were able to gain SSH access to your router that would have been one of the first things that they guessed. If I were you I&#039;d reset those routers and NOT set such easy passwords anymore.</p>									</div>
