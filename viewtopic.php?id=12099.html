					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m thinking of replacing the minipci wireless adapter in my asus wl500gp, and looking for a card which supports simultaneus dualband (a/b or if possible a/b/g). <br />Does such a card even exist? (googling revealed at least such chipsets do exist, but no products to buy...)<br />Would OpenWRT support this?</p><p>Thanks in advance for any tips.</p><p>P.S: I previously tried getting a gigbyte GN-WI01HT, but after the availability from the online store got postponed several times, it now is &quot;undetermined&quot;, and no other place seems to have one (in germany/europe). Anyone having the same problem? Or knows what&#039;s up with the cards/gigabyte (no other cards seem to be available except the b/g card)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>KanjiMonster</strong> on 15 Aug 2007, 17:24)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not aware of any dual radio mini pci cards out there.&nbsp; Certainly would be useful if they existed.&nbsp; </p><p>I don&#039;t think two radio chips and their support components would fit on a standard size mpci card.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would probably force it to be oversized. </p><p>Definitely post back hear if you find something.</p>									</div>
