					<p>Hello,<br />Okay, I have the following problem:<br />We want to build a WLAN between 2 houses with WRT54GL an openwrt.<br />In both houses are one LAN and WAN with a router (not the WRT54GL). Our problem is now that we want to share data and internet between those 2 LANs.</p><p>Data is not the problem, but the internet connection is our problem, but we want that we can say â€œhey I want give only 2Mbit of my WAN speed to the WRT54GL for the other LAN. But the own LAN have full speed and the normal data between this 2 LANs have also full speed.â€ <br />So is there software to manage this in the openwrt? Or has anyone another idea? </p><p>We need also the option to switch to a mesh network, but we want to plan more than 2 houses in this WLAN and we think that a mesh is the best solution to connect more people if we need it.</p><p>I hope that anyone can understand what I mean.</p>									</div>

					<p>Basicly you need a lot of iptables.<br />You need to set up QOS to allow traffic from the other router but only 2Mbit.<br />You need iptables to forward certain traffic to a certain router. You can&#039;t trunk the traffic (I assume because it aren&#039;t 2 ethernet ports). And because of trunking is not possible I wouldn&#039;t start setting this up. Because there isn&#039;t any advantage to this only problems. Because if 1 router is down then some traffic of the other router won&#039;t work anymore because it was passed to the other router.</p>									</div>
