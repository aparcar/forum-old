					<p>The table of hardware lists 58 devices with 2 or more cores.&nbsp; Of these, about half are supported in some form.&nbsp; And yes, most are not the basic home router, but that appears to be changing.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_all?datasrt=^supported%20current%20rel&amp;dataflt">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_e … mp;dataflt</a>[CPU%20MHz*~]=x</p><p>I am under the impression that only one core is supported on any of these devices.</p><p>Can some one from dev please comment on the status and challenges of implementing multi-core support.&nbsp; I am looking to improve OpenVPN in particular, but I expect that this will speed things up in general for these devices.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the followup</p><p>Does it not make sense to offer for the x86/64 a second variation with SMP enabled as most CPUs today are multi core?&nbsp; <br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/x86/64/">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/x86/64/</a></p><p>I realize that you will suggest to build this, however I think that many new adopters would prefer to hit the ground running and that this feature is a substantial accelerator, literally, for installation and performance.&nbsp; It also assumes that they have a build environment, which I do not.</p><p>It&#039;s hard to attract new users with a high end device to this firmware when they can also run ipFire or pfSense and have this feature built in.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot of work just to be able to test OpenWRT.&nbsp; While ultimately they may want to build their own, these devices generally have a lot of space to install packages and image size is not an issue.</p>									</div>
