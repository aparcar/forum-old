					<p>Hi friends!</p><p>I&#039;m many-years Linux user and it is not my first Opened router. It was never easy, but at least once succeed. </p><p>So, I have Netgear DG834GT router and started to mess around with it. Based on really good written howto (wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg834gt) I&#039;ve uploaded Backfire (downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm63xx/openwrt-DG834GT_DG834PN-squashfs-cfe.bin) onto. </p><p>Everything went ok - it booted up and I was able to do some changes in config etc. But... When router was offline (nothing connected to eth1 aka WAN) I was able to connect to LuCI. When i put ethernet cable to WAN, i got &quot;external&quot; IP and was unable to connect to the web interface (internet works).<br />Didn&#039;t want to annoy about asking such a trivial question I started to messing around. Tried to change some stuff about DHCP, do this (wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/dg834gt#assigning_a_wan_port_with_dhcp) and finally upgrade to Barrier Breaker...</p><p>As stated in the wiki:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Barrier Breaker 14.07 appears to work too.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yeah, it works... barely... The web interface is almost useless*, so I decided to downgrade. Through the Web interface, it was impossible (Bad gateway, too long response...).</p><p>*changing root&#039;s password was a pain! </p><p>Failsafe failed - triggering &quot;reset button&quot; enters router into failsafe (blinking LEDs), but I was unable to connect. </p><p>So I tried over ssh. </p><p>Here (techtrickszone.com/2017/05/02/openwrt-firmware-upgradation-with-ssh-command-with-piture/) is information to use WinSCP - I know scp and I&#039;m Linux user - let&#039;s check if it works - yeah! it works. </p><p>So i copied the previous image to /tmp.</p><p>Stall. </p><p>Scp stalled or I was unable to log in over ssh. Tried (askubuntu.com/questions/82984/why-does-scp-get-stalled-how-do-i-resolve-it#82988)<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>scp -l 512 openwrt-DG834GT_DG834PN-squashfs-cfe.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp</code></pre></div><p>and it didn&#039;t help a lot... <br />I made conclusion - it is because out of ram. So I found this (wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade)</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>One has actually 752+6636 KiB of free memory available.</p><p>quickest and safest way to free up, some RAM is to delete the opkg packages file:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rm -r /tmp/opkg-lists/</code></pre></div><p>drop caches:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sync &amp;&amp; echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code></pre></div><p>prevent wireless drivers to be loaded at next boot and then reboot:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>rm /etc/modules.d/*80211*
rm /etc/modules.d/*ath9k*
rm /etc/modules.d/b43*
reboot</code></pre></div><p>The wireless drivers, usually take up quite some amount of RAM and are not required (unless you are connected via wireless of course ;-)), so an easy way to free up some RAM is to delete the symlinks in etc/modules.d so these are not loaded into memory at the next reboot.</p></blockquote></div><p>After doing so I was able to scp image and start sysupgrade:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r writer /tmp/image </code></pre></div><p> - didn&#039;t work.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>sysupgrade -v /tmp/filename-of-downloaded-sysupgrade.bin</code></pre></div><p> - hung once. I&#039;ve tried again and left it over the night (but disconnected) - we&#039;ll see tomorrow <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>What can I do if it fails? If not, how to solve the first problem - being unable to connect to web interface after connecting WAN.</p><p>P.S. I&#039;m able to solder RS - no problem for me - if it is necessary.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>e-san</strong> on 15 Feb 2018, 22:10)</p>

					<p>This was originally a DSL modem/router so it doesn&#039;t have a dedicated &quot;WAN&quot; ethernet port, as it was expecting the Internet to be connected by DSL.&nbsp; Since there is no open-source driver, the DSL modem function is not supported by OpenWrt though, thus it won&#039;t be possible to connect anything to the DSL port.&nbsp; </p><p>You will need to set up VLANs in the switch and on the CPU port to make one of the four Ethernet ports a WAN port.&nbsp; The default configuration probably has them all switched together as a LAN.</p><p>How to do that on Backfire is something that no one here will remember.&nbsp; You&#039;re dealing with antique software, and hardware.</p>									</div>
