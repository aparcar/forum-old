					<p>You will have to do some reading on routed non-NAT networks, and iptables. You could I suppose just put the noteb ook as DMZ host, that way all &quot;external&quot; traffic sees that notebook, if it&#039;s just the one.</p><p>You haven&#039;t mentioned why you would want to do this? If you are on public internet you invite people to break into your system.</p>									</div>

					<p>Um, in your diagram you say that your notebook and router are on 172.25.168.0 range but you have a routing rule for 172.25.160.0 to the gateway. Is this a typo? cause I don&#039;t think that would work with a subnet of 255.255.255.0 which I assume you are using. Your route on the adsl must be to route 172.19.25.168.0 to 192.168.0.254</p><p>I agree with vincentfox - go read on routed networks - leave NAT alone.<br />I would break the bridge and setup routing between the two interfaces.</p><p>As for making those ports available... <br />Go and have a look at /etc/firewall.user&nbsp; &nbsp;very nice and easy to use.</p>									</div>

					<p>I will assume that outbound rules and rotes are done properly, or you wouldn&#039;t get out to the internet. Shouldn&#039;t matter much if you use NAT or not. You will need to make two static routes. One on each router. And open and forward the ports you want open on at least your NAT in ADSL modem. If you have ip tables enabled on your WRT, then you will have to open the ports you want open. If you are using NAT, you will have to add a forwarding rule. For ping you will have to allow ICMP traffic. By default it is blocked.</p>									</div>
