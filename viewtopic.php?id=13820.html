					<p>Hi,</p><p>I have two Asus WL-500g Premium routers, one running the original Asus firmware, the other one running OpenWRT Kamikaze 7.09.<br />My ISP uses PPPoE with an MTU of 1460. I noticed problem with certain websites (for instance downloading Nero for Linux from the Nero website didn&#039;t work).<br />I recall that this could be related to MTU problems... packets getting &quot;too&quot; big and both ends being unable to work it out stops the traffic between those sites altogether.</p><p>To make sure it is a problem with OpenWRT, I also tried it with an identical Asus router running the original firmware. Both routers are behind yet another router and I can easily switch the default gateway from the OpenWRT router to the router with the original firmware. The original firmware works just fine...</p><p>I tried getting as much info from the original firmware as possible and noticed the following options are being used by PPP on the original firmware (which I tried copying into the /etc/config/network file, see below). Unfortunately it makes no difference (and some options are not being recognised so I had to take them out). I also tried running PPP from the command line:</p><p># pppd file /ppp/options</p><p>but this was unable to setup the Internet connection (it got a wrong IP address from the ISP??)</p><p>I also tried setting all interfaces to MTU 1460... to no avail.</p><p>Does anyone have any pointers how I can further research/debug this issue?</p><p>cheers,<br />Jan</p><br /><br /><br /><p>#### isp configuration<br />config interface&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; isp<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;eth0.1&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;pppoe&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mtu&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1460<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option mru&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1460<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option username&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;*****&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option password&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;******&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option idle&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1800 demand<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option usepeerdns<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option defaultroute<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option persist<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ipcp-accept-remote<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option ipcp-accept-local<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option noipdefault<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ktune<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option default-asyncmap nopcomp noaccomp<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option novj&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nobsdcomp nodeflate<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option lcp-echo-interval 10<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;option lcp-echo-failure 6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option unit&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0</p><p>#</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Alex,</p><p>MTU was all set OK. ppp attempts to set the MTU to 1500 but doesn&#039;t succeed to do so (and complains that I may have serious connection problems). <br />The connection comes up OK though. The clamp-mss-to-pmut fixes the MTU problem.</p><p>thanks for your help!<br />Jan</p><p>PS for other readers: you need to substitute &quot;-A&quot; for $FNC and the name of your external interface for $WANADSL (without the quotes) in Alex&#039;s example.</p>									</div>
