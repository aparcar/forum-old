					<p>My understanding of VLANs is thin. My ALIX 2d13 does not appear to have a switch, but has 3 Ethernet ports. One is WAN and the other 2 are bridged for LAN. I&#039;m looking at IoT devices, and it&#039;s been suggested to put them on a separate VLAN, which I do not think I can do.</p><p>Is moving one Ethernet port to another interface &quot;IoT&quot; a valid approach for this hardware?</p><p>If so would this be correct<br />Current<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;lan&#039;

					<p>Yes that is what you could do, then connect your &quot;things&quot; to port 2 and the more trusted LAN users to port 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can use cheap unmanaged Ethernet switches to expand the networks.</p><p>You can create VLANs on a single port by referring to it as (for example) &#039;eth0.1&#039; in one network and &#039;eth0.2&#039; in another.&nbsp; This causes tagged packets to be sent through the cable.&nbsp; The device at the other end of the cable must be VLAN-aware, such as another OpenWrt router or a managed switch.</p>									</div>
