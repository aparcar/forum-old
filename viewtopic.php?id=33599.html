					<p>I have two WRT350n V2 routers, one for providing a LAN at home and one to play with (before updating the router in use). My computer has 2 network ports, so I can connect both routers at the same time to my computer. With the same configuration this (of course) goes horribly wrong (as the routers will have the same IP addresses).</p><p>Now I was planning to use uci-defaults to automatically change some settings to prevent the problem of have the IP addresses (and some other things now I am at it). I thought of using the MAC address, but it is not available at booting time (as it seems), same goes for /sys/class/net/lan1/address<br />So, using the MAC address seems impossible.</p><p>My question is, is there any other method to determine which of the 2 routers is booting?<br />Grabbing the unique serial number would be an option I suppose, but I do not how and cannot find this information for a WRT350n.<br />Or are there other options I did not think of?</p><p>Thanks</p>									</div>
