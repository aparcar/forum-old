					<p>Dear members, <br />I am quite new with OpenWRT and software development. Actually, I would like to do some modification in the source code related to 802.11s protocol. I have no idea from where shall I start? I am trying to go through OpenWRT Beginners guide bu it looks very simple. I shall be very thankful if you tell me how can I get the source code? how could I go into it and do appropriate modifications. </p><p>Regards<br />Umar</p>									</div>
