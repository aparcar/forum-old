					<p>Let&#039;s see if I can do this...<br />First of all, sorry for my bad english, I&#039;m Brazilian.</p><p>I started trying to do Tagged VLANs on dd-wrt an never understood it.<br />Then I came to openwrt and... well, now I have one Virtual Machine running Openwrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1, with multiwan (2 wans), DDNS (one for each wan), one private network, one guest network limited to 1 mbps (wired connections too) and one network for my virtual machines.<br />Connected to this VM, there is a Netgear WNDR 3700 v1 (same Openwrt version) as Switch/AP (one 2.4 Ghz wifi on the private network, one 2.4 Ghz wifi on the guest network and one 5.0 Ghz wifi on the private network) and a Tp-link WR1043ND v1.8 (same Openwrt version) as Switch/AP (one 2.4 Ghz wifi on the private network, one 2.4 Ghz wifi on the<br /> guest network). The guest network on both routers is the same.<br />The reason I&#039;m using a VM, is because none of my routers (wndr3700 and wr1043) could handle both wans with perfomance.</p><p>So, to configure the guest network across both routers... (In my case, I use more then two routers)</p><p><strong>I&#039;m assuming:</strong><br />-First router is Netgear WNDR 3700 v1, with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1 (this one will be the one on the internet)<br />-Second router is TP-Link WR1043ND v1.8, with OpenWrt Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1<br />-The routers are on First Boot, with Luci installed on both routers<br />-The routers are not connected to each other, yet<br />-IP Range to be used for the private network: 192.168.1.0/24 (192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254)<br />-IP Range to be used for the guest network: 192.168.2.0/24 (192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.254)</p><p>On your computer:<br /><strong>a-)</strong> Connect a cable between your computer and the SECOND router, on port 1. (or 2, 3, 4... just remember which of them you&#039;re connected to)<br /><strong>b-)</strong> Set your IP Address to 192.168.1.10 (for example), with netmask 255.255.255.0 (if you want, you can set gateway and DNS to 192.168.1.1)</p><p>On the second router:<br /><strong>1-)</strong> Access <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>, login to Luci Web Interface with user root and no password<br /><strong>2-)</strong> Go to System, Administration, type in a password, confirm it, click save &amp; apply<br /><strong>3-)</strong> Go to Network, Interfaces. Click &quot;Edit&quot; (Under Actions) in the LAN interface.<br /><strong>4-)</strong> Set: IPv4 Address to 192.168.1.2, IPv4 netmask: 255.255.255.0, IPv4 gateway: 192.168.1.1. If you want, you can use a custom DNS (like 192.168.1.1 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/tongue.png" width="15" height="15" alt="tongue" />), without a DNS you cannot install nothing on the router.<br /><strong>5-)</strong> Check &quot;Disable DHCP for this interface&quot; under &quot;DHCP Server&quot;. Hit Save &amp; Apply.<br /><strong>6-)</strong> Wait a moment and access <a href="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</a>. Log in to the router with root and password (created on item 2)<br /><strong>7-)</strong> Go to Network, Interfaces again. If I remember right, the WAN interface is actually VLAN 2 (under &quot;WAN&quot; there is something like &quot;eth0.2&quot;). If you want, you can delete the WAN interface (it will not be used on this router),<br />so you can use all 5 ports of the router.<br /><strong>8-)</strong> Now go to Network, Switch.<br />- I THINK WR1043ND comes configured like this:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;VLAN ID 1, Port 0 off (its the wan port), Ports 1, 2, 3, 4 untagged, CPU port tagged<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;VLAN ID 2, Port 0 untagged, Ports 1,2,3,4 off, CPU port tagged (this was the VLAN in use by the WAN interface)<br />- IF you deleted the WAN interface, you can use it to connect this router to the first router. If not, you can use ports 1 to 4 instead. Change both VLANs to (assuming you deleted the WAN interface):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;VLAN ID 1, Port 0 tagged, Ports 1 to 4 untagged, CPU port tagged<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;VLAN ID 2, Port 0 tagged, Ports 1 to 4 off, CPU port tagged<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Save &amp; Apply (And just to be sure, reboot your router)<br />- If this is done right, you should have access to your router again in a few moments.<br />- This way you&#039;re saying to the router that VLAN 1 (Already configured &quot;LAN&quot; interface/network) AND VLAN 2 (the one we will configure as &quot;GUEST&quot; interface/network) will use the (original labeled) WAN port</p><p><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you TAG the port that you&#039;ve connected your computer, you will be <strong>locked out</strong> of the router, unless you tag your computer network interface too.</p><p><strong>9-)</strong> (if you rebooted, log in again). Got to Network, Interfaces. Click Add new interface.<br /><strong>10-)</strong> Give it a name (GUEST), the protocol is &quot;Static Address&quot;, on &quot;Cover the following interface&quot; select &quot;VLAN Interface eth0.2&quot;, and hit &quot;submit&quot;.<br /><strong>11-)</strong> On the next page, set: IPv4 Address to 192.168.2.2, IPv4 netmask: 255.255.255.0. You don&#039;t need to setup DHCP Server (will be configured on the other router). Hit Save.<br /><strong>12-)</strong> On the SAME page click on &quot;Firewall Settings&quot;. On &quot;unspecified -or- create&quot; put &quot;guest&quot;. Hit Save &amp; Apply<br /><strong>13-)</strong> Go to Network, Wifi. Click Add. ESSID &quot;Guest&quot; (example), Mode Access Point, Network &quot;GUEST&quot; (created on item 10). Configure security as(or &quot;if&quot;) desired. Save &amp; Apply.<br /><strong>14-)</strong> Go to Network, Firewall. Delete the &quot;WAN&quot; zone on firewall or, at least, disable the lan forwarding to it.<br /><strong>15-)</strong> Connect the WAN port of this router, to port 4 of the first router (which is Port 0, in Luci Web Interface). At this point, they do not &quot;see&quot; each other... yet.<br /><strong>16-)</strong> (Optional) If you want a little more security: Go to Network, Firewall. Under &quot;zones&quot;, change &quot;Input&quot; of &quot;guest&quot; to &quot;drop&quot;. Save &amp; Apply.<br />-This way, the guest network could no reach this router, it is only used to &quot;pass&quot; the traffic to the first router<br /><strong>17-)</strong> Now, remove the cable connecting your computer and this router, and connect the cable to the first router, on port 1 which is port 3 on Luci (or remember the on you&#039;ve used).</p><p>On the first router (the one connected to the internet):</p><p><strong>18-)</strong> Access <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>, login to Luci Web Interface with user root and no password<br /><strong>19-)</strong> Go to System, Administration, type in a password, confirm it. Click Save &amp; Apply<br /><strong>20-)</strong> Configure your WAN (Network, Interfaces, &quot;Edit&quot; on WAN and so on). If you configured your computer with gateway AND dns, you should have internet now.<br /><strong>21-)</strong> Go to Network, Switch.<br />- On &quot;VLANs&quot; you probably have something like VLAN ID 1, Port 0,1,2,3 Untagged, Port 4 off, CPU tagged<br />- Click Add, it should appear &quot;VLAN ID&quot; &quot;2&quot;.<br />- Configure both VLAN like this:<br />&nbsp; (if you did item 15 as I told) VLAN ID 1, Port 0 tagged, ports 1,2,3 untagged, Port 4 off, CPU tagged<br />&nbsp; VLAN ID 2, Port 0 tagged, ports 1,2,3,4 off, CPU tagged.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Save &amp; Apply (And just to be sure, reboot your router)<br />- If this is done right, you should have access to your router again in a few moments.<br /><strong>22-)</strong> (if you rebooted, log in again). Go to Network, Interfaces. Click Add new interface.<br /><strong>23-)</strong> Give it a name (GUEST), the protocol is &quot;Static Address&quot;, on &quot;Cover the following interface&quot; select &quot;VLAN Interface eth0.2&quot;, and hit &quot;submit&quot;.<br /><strong>24-)</strong> On the next page, click &quot;Setup DHCP Server&quot;. The page will reload. Set: IPv4 Address to 192.168.2.1, IPv4 netmask: 255.255.255.0. Configure DHCP as desired. Hit Save.<br /><strong>25-)</strong> On the SAME page click on &quot;Firewall Settings&quot;. On &quot;unspecified -or- create&quot; put &quot;guest&quot;. Hit Save &amp; Apply<br /><strong>26-)</strong> Go to Network, Wifi. Click Add. ESSID &quot;Guest&quot; (example), Mode Access Point, Network &quot;GUEST&quot; (created on item 23). Configure security as(or &quot;if&quot;) desired. Save &amp; Apply.<br /><strong>27-)</strong> Go to Network, Firewall. Under &quot;Zones&quot; click &quot;Edit&quot; on GUEST. Under &quot;Inter-Zone Forwarding&quot; select &quot;wan&quot; on &quot;Allow forward to destination zones&quot;. Save &amp; Apply.</p><p>Well... If I didn&#039;t forgot nothing, I think it&#039;s done.<br />This way you have 2 networks (private and guest) on both routers. The guest wifi accessing internet, but not your private network.<br />It&#039;s possible to change a lot of things like...<br />- Is it possible to put a wired client on guest network? Yes<br />- Is it possible to the guest network access my private network? Yes<br />- Is it possible to assign a different DNS to the guest network? Yes<br />- Is it possible to limit the download rate of the guest network? Yes<br />And so on.</p><p>Could someone validate all of this? I&#039;ve done it by myself, with no one validating.</p>									</div>

					<p>Nice tutorial, but keep in mind that not all routers are the same, some have eth1 for WAN for example, and some don&#039;t supprt tagged and untagged traffic on the same port.</p><p>Also some routers can&#039;t work with vlans at all.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the walkthrough digital. One question though: on my WNDR3700 v1, the CPU is set as untagged in the default VLAN configuration. I&#039;ve never messed with VLANs before so it&#039;s vanilla. What difference does tagging or untagging the CPU make? Can I just add a second VLAN and reconfigure both VLAN 1 and 2 as per your instructions but ignore the setting on the CPU?</p><p>Thank you!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Borromini,<br />You know that part that I wrote &quot;Warning&quot;? THAT&#039;s... because of this router <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />You&#039;re using which version off Openwrt? It is Backfire 10.03.1?<br />Because the first one I was using in this router was this version, and to make vlan work I had to use a workaround listed here in the foruns. I don&#039;t know if that is a bug or something, I know that everytime I changed CPU port to tagged, I had to reset the router.<br />And then I upgraded to Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1, and my CPU port was tagged, and I could work with vlans without problem.<br />So, if you&#039;re working with Backfire 10.03.1 (WNDR3700 v1 router) DO NOT change the CPU port to tagged, or you will be locked out of the router.<br />(Searching for the topic that has the workaround)</p><p>Edited:<br />Found it on wiki. Read this...<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#switch.ports.for.vlans">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wnd … .for.vlans</a><br />This is valid for Backfire 10.03.1</p><p>There you can see this:<br />&quot;config interface lan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname&nbsp; &nbsp; eth0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option type&nbsp; &nbsp; bridge<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option proto&nbsp; &nbsp; static<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr&nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask&nbsp; &nbsp; 255.255.255.0&quot;</p><p>AND...</p><p>&quot;config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp; rtl8366s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;5*&quot;</p><p>config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option device&nbsp; &nbsp; rtl8366s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option ports&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;1 2 3 5t&quot;&quot;</p><p>Basically what this shows is: You&#039;ve configured interface &quot;LAN&quot; to use eth0.1 (VLAN 1), BUT you&#039;ve configured both vlans (0 and 1) and Luci do not work well with that. Well... actually it does not work at all with that config.<br />So, if you are using Backfire and continue to use it, you will have to do this workaround and ignore vlan configuration on Luci.</p><p>My config (on Attitude Adjustment 12.09-rc1) don&#039;t have a &quot;VLAN 0&quot;, and is like this:</p><p>&quot;config switch_vlan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option device &#039;rtl8366s&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option vlan &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ports &#039;0t 1t 2 3t 5t&#039;&quot;</p><p>and</p><p>&quot;config interface &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option type &#039;bridge&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option proto &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ipaddr &#039;192.168.1.30&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option netmask &#039;255.255.255.224&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option gateway &#039;192.168.1.29&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option dns &#039;192.168.1.26 192.168.1.25&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option ifname &#039;eth0.1 eth1&#039;<br />&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>digital</strong> on 3 May 2013, 03:07)</p>

					<p>Borromini...I&#039;m confused.<br />What I know is that you can have only one untagged vlan for each port, didn&#039;t know that this applies to the cpu port.

					<p>Sometimes if a device has two physical ports eth0 and eth1, by default there is one vlan configured and the cpu port is untagged.</p><p>However, most devices both support tagged and untagged cpu port (not that often a mix of them).
