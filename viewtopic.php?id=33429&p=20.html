CarrierWrt seems to be an implementation of the anyfi.net software on top of a heavily locked-down OpenWrt. This environment is not intended to power personal routers but rather to extend a carrier&#039;s existing network through distributed routers, receiving the credentials to connect from the carrier&#039;s network. From this standpoint it makes sense that they also disable the failsafe mechanism.</p><p>Cunningly, they don&#039;t give any kind of warning that this firmware may make your router useless, and they even name their firmware images indistinguishably from official OpenWrt builds.</p><p>To be quite honest, I don&#039;t completely understand their published patches, maybe someone who&#039;s more versed in reading their patches can help out here. However, I do get that they set a random password to the Wifi, whatever sense that may make. They set all the wired interfaces to WAN (using DHCP) and open the firewall to HTTP and SSH access, so they can access it remotely, but I cannot find any credentials one would have to use to get access.</p><p>So you might be lucky: Try to connect your MR3020 to another router that serves DHCP, have it get an IP address, and try to connect to the LuCI interface through that other router. If you&#039;re lucky, no root password is set and you can get into the web interface and flash a proper OpenWrt firmware.

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I guess I&#039;ve somehow bricked my MR3020, I did the following:</p><p>1.)

Flashed it via the (standard/factory) Web-UI</p><p>After it finished flashing I tried to connect to it via putty, after several attempts I noticed that it didn&#039;t assign me an IP address through the Ethernet interface. Tired it on 2 PCs, wasn&#039;t successful. <br />Next step was trying to get the serial port up &amp; running so I opened it up and connected everything as stated in the Wiki. Unfortunately, the device doesn&#039;t send anything on the serial connection when powered on.<br />Also, when connecting it to a router via Ethernet it doesn&#039;t get an IP address, so no chance getting it connected that way.<br />When powering on the Power and WPS/Reset LEDs light up, after a second or two the WPS LED starts blinking for 5 seconds and then remains powered on steadily.</p><p>Has somebody experienced this behavior so far or has any ideas on how to fix it or did I completely destroy it?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>interceptor</strong> on 22 Sep 2014, 20:56)</p>

					<p>Hello. First post here.</p><p>I managed to make my MR-3020 work with a Huawei E3272 modem. Problem is, it only works reliably if I supplement extra power to the USB modem OR disable wireless, else it gives all kinds of USB errors and only connect sporadically. With the OEM firmware it works without any issues, no extra power and wireless enabled all the time.</p><p>I tried installing the last trunk, but when I installed luci I ran out of space. I have a spare MR-3020 so I&#039;m willing to test anything that may result in success.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Edit: using a USB power meter, I see it never goes past around 300mA, even when sending extra power to the modem. In fact, the power consumption remains largely the same. The power supply is rated 1A, and I could get 900mA out of it to charge my phone, so it doesn&#039;t seem to be a low-power issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>john410</strong> on 30 Sep 2014, 14:15)</p>

					<p>I tried CC, not BB, as I couldn&#039;t find it. Are bb trunks being deployed daily? The &quot;bleeding edge&quot; on the wiki takes me to the CC download. </p><p>Also, I don&#039;t want to use extra USB devices because I carry it around, I want to keep it as light as possible.

Trouble is, I still couldn&#039;t plug it on cold boot, because I didn&#039;t manage to find a way to execute this command before the USB initialization, so I had to always plug the modem after boot. Also, this trick wouldn&#039;t help with random disconnects. Extra power to USB - even from the same PSU that&#039;s powering the modem - solved all of this, even without this &quot;hack&quot;.</p><p>edit: found Barrier Breaker files. I&#039;ll give it a shot.

So far I&#039;ve been supplying extra power to the USB and, as I said before, when I do that I have no issues.
