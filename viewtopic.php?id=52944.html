					<p>I&#039;m using an Academic campus network and we have a proxy server that connects us to the outside world. I use an Android phone and right now it&#039;s impossible for me to set proxy settings (with authentication) on my phone without rooting it. I was thinking, I can setup some kind of forwarding on my wireless router to send the packets to the proxy server. </p><p>Many online articles give solution to this problem with the use of iptables, but all their setups consist of connecting to a custom proxy server which requires special Transparent proxy capabilities turned on. I don&#039;t have admin access to the campus proxy server, so I need a solution that only needs modifications on my router side. </p><p>My basic understanding is that my router needs to mark all the packets coming from my phone and forward it to the proxy server. It would also need to add or modify certain proxy headers in the packets. I know how to achieve the first step with the help of iptables. What I can&#039;t figure out is the second step.</p><p>Note: I am connecting to an authenticated proxy server that uses basic password based authentication.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hashken</strong> on 26 Sep 2014, 06:00)</p>
