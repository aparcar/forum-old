					<p>Hi,</p><p>I am working on a project to be able to configure local router wireless settings from a cloud web server.</p><p>This means I need a customized firmware for local router and then setting up a cloud web server to integrate the both of them.</p><p>I am new to OpenWRT and so far my understanding is that it is ideal for optimization of the router device itself, but I am unclear if OpenWRT is able to connect with a web server and then have the firmware settings changed by the server.</p><p>Can OpenWRT help achieve the scenario above? Has anyone done this before?</p><p>Regards,<br />Ken</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>Setting wifi via command line is pretty easy.<br />Add a little curl or wget to it to fetch the desired configuration from a remote HTTP server, maybe use any digital signature and you&#039;re done.</p><p>Currently I push configuration via SSH from one instance to a couple of others, just by calling this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ssh openwrthost ash &lt; wifi-setup-script.sh</code></pre></div><p>But of course you can inverse control by not pushing data but pulling. Use a cron job and you&#039;re done.</p><p>The actually nice part comes when you write your wifi setup script. </p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>
