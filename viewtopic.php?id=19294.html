					<p>Hello, </p><p>I&#039;m an experienced user of dd-wrt trying for the very first time openwrt (kamikaze 8.09).<br />In my first setting I made many mistakes, and I&#039;m not anymore able to connect to my router - router gets an ip address from WAN, but I do not know its LAN address so I&#039;m not able to connect, as far as it doesn&#039;t accept connections from WAN or from LAN with WAN address (which is more strange.........)</p><p>I need to restore defaults to enter my router and repeat configuration tests and experiences.</p><p>In order to restore defaults I entered in failsafe mode and executed </p><p>mtd -r erase nvram,</p><p>which didn&#039;t give result, the configuration being the same (I can see the wi-fi net I tried to create).</p><p>Is this instruction deprecated in kamikaze? How can I get it to work?</p><p>Thank you for your kind attention,</p><p>Paolo</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.</p><p>Since Kamikaze totally ignores nvram, erasing it won&#039;t help. However, you want to kill the jffs2 overlay to revert all changes since flash.</p><p>Use this command:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>mtd -r erase rootfs_data</code></pre></div><p>~ JoW</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jow</strong> on 10 Mar 2009, 03:10)</p>
