					<p>Thanks for your suggestion, but as I indicated at the top, my skills are weak here.&nbsp; I really do not understand what this does or how to apply it.</p><p>The problem is with a travel router, the OpenWRT OpenVPN CLIENT will not have internet access until the router is connected to a hotspot, but it keeps trying to connect and when one looks at the logs they have an incorrect time as there is no time server available at the time sysntpd runs.&nbsp; It&#039;s not an OpenVPN issue per say, but the logs show (expected) failures and it&#039;s a waste of CPU to have it keep trying (thus stopping it right off).&nbsp; It makes more sense waiting until I manually connect to a hot spot before first resetting the router time and then starting OpenVPN.&nbsp; Right now I just reboot, as it will auto reconnect to the SSID if its valid.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier to do, especially from a smart phone.</p><p>The WAN will have the old connection data&nbsp; (IP, etc.) when it boots, they are just not valid values, unless I am connecting to the last place I was.&nbsp; I prefer to assume not.&nbsp; Again, nothing to do with the VPN tunnel IPs either.&nbsp; Just looking for a working WAN IP, which is why I thought WGET or Ping would be good test. Even if the connection is good, the time is bad, so I rather reset the entire thing every time.</p><p>I see a file called network.sh already exists, and not clear if this is defining a new function or something that runs after it.&nbsp; I also think that his is a framework as opposed to a solution.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s checking a loop for 6o seconds, and then I assume quitting, and using some internal function I do not understand to decide if the connection is up.&nbsp; I also do not need to see messages, but assume this is just a place holder for the actual code.</p>									</div>

					<p>A few things to consider:<br />a) If we are talking &quot;travel router&quot; scenario, wget (and ping, too) may succeed, suggesting a working WAN connection. It may, however, still be restricted (think captive portal in a hotel).<br />b) From own extensive experience, shutting down OpenVPN to &quot;conserve CPU&quot; is really, really unnecessary. OpenVPN retrying periodically to make a connection does not have any measurable impact on the CPU. Most of the time it would be waiting for connection attempts timing out.</p><p>So the only real problem you are facing is the wrong system time. I&#039;m not intimately familiar with the OpenWrt NTP client, but in my experience, it will retry at least periodically, no?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 6 Sep 2015, 22:07)</p>

You still have one process trying to establish a connection, either wget or OpenVPN. So, really, you might as well have OpenVPN try directly.</p><p>Edit/Addendum: Also, IMHO, wget is generally not very suitable to &quot;test&quot; connections on a regular basis. Very recently I had a very similar script logging data from a web server in regular intervals. I don&#039;t know why, but I occasionally would find the wget process hang/freeze/sit around idle. Obviously it hit some condition, best case it just wouldn&#039;t return to the main loop and freeze the script, worst case it would reboot the system.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>The log is shorter and easier to read if I need.</p></blockquote></div><p>Look into OpenVPN&#039;s verbosity parameter. Also, there&#039;s not much point to the logfile, either OpenVPN can make the connection or not, in practice there&#039;s not a whole lot you can debug or modify from the client side once it is properly set up.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I have to manually initiate the connection, so once I login through the portal, unless they block ping or wget I am ok.</p></blockquote></div><p>What I mean is the opposite: Your wget or ping test may very well report success on an uninitiated session.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 7 Sep 2015, 02:50)</p>

					<p>@moeller0, I now have a working script.&nbsp; wget did not work at my location or with the existing format.&nbsp; I think it was not returning a value, as even once the WAN was up the added Echo comments still indicated it was in the &quot;while&quot; loop (Offline).&nbsp; I used &quot;nc&quot; to check for a connection which was the last option in the original reference link, but had to remove the -z option.</p><p>I also am not clear on the status of the sysntpd function during the local script.&nbsp; I think the local script is running before the sysntpd is done starting, but that&#039;s a long time.&nbsp; In any event restart keep failing, so I used stop and then start.&nbsp; Stop always fails, which is why I think it&#039;s not yet started.&nbsp; I also had to increase the sleep time for the sysntpd to 30 seconds so that the time was actually reset before OpenVPN starts, just to make things look good.</p><p>I also had to move the &quot;if&quot; out of the &quot;while&quot; and have it run sequential.&nbsp; I think calling the &#039;take_a_break&#039; function kept it from ever getting to the bottom.&nbsp; I realize I do not need the conditional that restarts VPN, but I left it.</p><p>As metai points, out this may not work in a captive portal or some other locations.&nbsp; I just was more interested in seeing if I still had the capability of fixing this.&nbsp; It was more brute force than skill.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Check to see if there is an internet connection
