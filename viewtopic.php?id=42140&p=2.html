					<p>I am not sure if you can flash the &quot;art&quot; from inside Openwrt.</p><p>As far as I know, the &quot;art&quot; area is normally write-protected, and you need to compile the removal of the write-protection right into the firmware (toggle a flag).</p><p>The correct command for openwrt flash operations is &quot;mtd&quot;.</p><p>If you are not compiling a firmware I think that you need to do the flashing from u-boot.

					<p>Well, that sounds bad. U-boot apparently just stops there.</p><p>I have never bothered to learn the correct u-boot commands to flash wndr3800 using it, so I can&#039;t give you the correct ones. But you might have to learn the commands :-(</p><p>You might first verify the contents of the current u-boot partition. Check the commands to download from u-boot (using the serial connection and kermit/ymodem/zmodem/xmodem/whatever...). Or use u-boot to set an IP address in the u-boot environment and then use TFTP to file transfer.</p><p>Try to download the u-boot partition to your PC. You can then compare it to the expected contents. My wndr3800 u-boot &amp; u-boot-env have been uploaded to: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t52c02rm20y8x9p/ooWlI23QzN/mtd">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t52c02rm20y8 … I23QzN/mtd</a></p><p>EDIT:<br />In wndr3800, the u-boot partition is first:<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.900000] 0x000000000000-0x000000050000 : &quot;u-boot&quot;<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.900000] 0x000000050000-0x000000070000 : &quot;u-boot-env&quot;<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.910000] 0x000000070000-0x000000ff0000 : &quot;firmware&quot;</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>hnyman</strong> on 8 Feb 2014, 20:11)</p>
