					<p>So I&#039;ve been having issues getting my Atheros card working with the new 8.09-2 image that were put out a few weeks ago, thread here: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23068">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=23068</a><br />so I decided I would try building my own image with the instructions from this thread: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=9180</a></p><p>The image seemed to build OK, but when I tried to upgrade it through the OpenWRT GUI, I keep getting this message after the file is uploaded:</p><p>haserl CGI Error</p><p>Attempted to send content larger than allowed limits.</p><br /><p>I&#039;ve tried building the image 3 times and I&#039;m getting this every time. I&#039;m doing x86, with Target System as ALIX. The first times I selected my own packages, but this most recent time I selected all packages just for kicks.</p><p>The file size of openwrt-x86-ext2.image is 55,008,768, which matches the good images I&#039;ve used in the past.</p><br /><p>I couldn&#039;t find anything on this error doing a search. Is there a way to force flash this image from the CLI? I thought about just flashing the CF card with it and see if it works, but if this image is indeed bad, then I&#039;ll just hold off.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jbradshw</strong> on 5 Feb 2010, 03:07)</p>
