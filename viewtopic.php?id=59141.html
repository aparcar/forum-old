					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am sorry if this has been answered already.</p><p>I have an application where I need to have a WiFi router that connects several devices. The devices will have fixed IP addresses (no DNS needed). For this application, I do not need an Internet connection. The network will be local and &#039;dark&#039;.</p><p>I spoke to the Belkin company regarding their router, and they told me that they have no router products that work correctly without being connected to the Internet. </p><p>So... does any version of this software that does /not/ require an Internet connection? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p><p>- Bill</p>									</div>

					<p>Every router can be used without an internet connection.<br />This is the case by definition of the term router.</p><p>Just connect your wireless devices to the router and don&#039;t connect it to the internet.<br />Works all the time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Alas, if only that were the case. For my Belkin router, a bunch of bad things happen if it is disconnected from the Internet:<br />When off the Net:</p><p>1. On a PC if you connect to the router, it actually puts up a page that indicates the router is not on the Internet, AND it then shows the Router password so you can correct the password. Want to hack into a Belkin router? Just un-plug it from the Internet, do an initial WiFi connection... and there&#039;s the router password shown on the page. <br />2. Android devices refuse connection altogether.<br />3. The router drops all WiFi connections at about 2 minute intervals, and then re-connects.</p><p>I called Belkin Tech Support to discuss, and they assured me, for their consumer and industrial products, all their routers work that way: they must have a connection to the Internet to work properly.</p><p>If you have knowledge of another vendor&#039;s products that do not have these types of issues while not connected to the Internet, please do share!</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can not speak to the issues with the android, but I can and have run my OpenWRT routers, at times, with out an internet connection with no issues (or complaints). </p><p>Also search on Pirate Box which is basically a device intended to run without a network connection, and runs on OpenWRT.</p><div class="quotebox"><cite>audiocore wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>Works all the time.</p></blockquote></div><p>Ok, there is at least one problem I can think of, the time server has nothing to talk to, and not many routers have batteries.</p>									</div>
