					<p>I am currently using the U.S Robotics 5461 Printer Server WiFi Router connected to my cable modem. I got this beast US$30 (after some US$30 rebates). According to this <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">Table of Hardware</a> on the OpenWRT web, this beast comes with a 200MHz <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=577575">Broadcom 5350</a> CPU chipset (WRT54GS v3 uses <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/products/Wireless-LAN/802.11-Wireless-LAN-Solutions/BCM5352E">Broadcom 5352</a> CPU chipset), only 2/8 MB flash/RAM, a 2.0 USB port, and the OpenWRT firmware has never been tested on this beast. Never mind about only the 2MB flash mainly because perhaps one can attach an old 32MB USB flash card, i.e. SD, CF, etc., to boost the size of flash RAM to hold more software package. The question I have is if this U.S. Robotics 5461 capable to run OpenWRT + asterisk with only 8MB RAM?</p>									</div>
