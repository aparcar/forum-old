					<p>I&#039;m pretty sure you can add that option to /etc/config/samba and make it stick. You just need the right uci syntax I think. Anyway, how about doing it the traditional Linux way instead of the openwrt way? Here&#039;s a brief idea.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code># Might need to check syntax. I do this from memory

# Disable samba from starting up at boot time using the openwrt way
/etc/init.d/samba disable

# Copy smb.conf to your own smb.conf
cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/smb/mysamba.conf

# Edit mysamba.conf and test it until you get it right
smbd -D -s /etc/samba/mysamba.conf

# Stop smbd and repeat after each test
killall smbd
smbd -D -s /etc/samba/mysamba.conf

# Write your own samba startup script based on the openwrt one
# Call it something like /etc/init.d/mysamba and make it start at boot with
/etc/init.d/mysamba enable

# Now your changes will definitely stick.</code></pre></div>									</div>
