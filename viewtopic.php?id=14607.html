					<p>Hello Folks,</p><p>I&#039;ve got White Russian working almost exactly the way I want, with DNS, OpenVPN, ntpclient, and SSH. Excellent work by all- this is very exciting!</p><p>I have one small problem, and haven&#039;t found an answer in the forums or in the documentation.</p><p>I have WPA working by installing the &quot;nas&quot; package. However something odd- if the router crashes (rare but it&#039;s happened 2 or 3 times) or I need to reboot it- the Apple client machines I have don&#039;t seem to rejoin nicely. It looks like I have to disable Airport, then re-enable it and it joins fine. Anything I might be doing wrong? The Intel Wireless Dell seems to be ok.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>~Mike</p>									</div>
