					<p>I bought a Netgear WNDR3700 recently, brought it home to find that the bloke had put OpenWRT on it.</p><p>Thing about OpenWRT is literally <strong>everything</strong> I search for returns page after page of technobabble. I&#039;m neither skilled nor remotely interested in ssh, telnet, docsis, uci, cli or luci-proto-relays and whatever other nonsense - I just want to set up my network nice and easy.</p><p>So, with that said, can someone kindy phrase in <strong>Human English</strong> how I can go about manually assigning IP addresses for my computers please? I have clicked on every single page in the control panel and not a single one comes close to being any sort of intuitive.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nicky9499</strong> on 12 Jan 2015, 14:04)</p>

					<p>I assume you mean static DHCP leases (so that the same host always gets the same IP with DHCP).<br />You can find that in Network -&gt; DHCP and DNS, scroll down to the &quot;Static Leases&quot; section at the bottom.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>What exactly are you trying to do?</p><p><strong>Hint your clients to specific IP addresses?</strong></p><p>Well, the exact wording of your question is exactly this one.<br />That&#039;s something the DHCP server of OpenWRT is for.<br />So go to &quot;Network =&gt; DHCP and DNS&quot;.<br />Search for section &quot;Static Leases&quot;.<br />Hit &quot;add&quot; and enter one line per client computer. <br />After pressing &quot;Save &amp; Apply&quot; you&#039;re done.</p><p><strong>Fore your routers Ip address on either the WAN or LAN interface?</strong></p><p>Just to be complete. According to your questions wording, that might be less important for you.<br />Go to &quot;Network =&gt; Interfaces&quot;.<br />Here you have at least one called &quot;LAN&quot; and one called &quot;WAN&quot;. <br />Edit the one you want to adjust.<br />&quot;WAN&quot; is set to &quot;Protocol: DHCP&quot; by default. You can adjust that, if your internet connection is not a DHCPed one.<br />&quot;LAN&quot; is set to &quot;Protocol: Static&quot; by default providing 192.168.0.1/24.</p><p><strong>Suggestion: Upgrade and reset</strong></p><p>To be honest, the OpenWRT UI of at least the two sections I mentioned is way better then every default interface of every SoHo router I know. And having worked as &quot;setup and repair guy&quot; part time during my study time I came accross several of those.</p><p>If anything is not as described, the former owner of the device has most likely messed something up. It&#039;s really easy to delete interfaces or modules as a whole. That could explain why you don&#039;t get along with your device and find it not intuitive.</p><p>In general: I would make sure to have the current stable 14.07 installed. If you&#039;re not interested in cutting edge stuff (which you&#039;re clearly not) that saves you a lot of trouble.<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_br â€¦ x/generic/</a><br />Search for the WNDR3700 sysupgrade.<br />During upgrading, I recommend the&quot;keep settings&quot; checkbox unticked to get rid of every existing messed up stuff.<br />This really gives you the most stable, non-messy and intuitive setup possible.<br />Find the upgrade and factory reset feature in &quot;System / Backup Flash Firmware&quot;.</p><p>Before upgrading you should search your device for the exact hardware version number. There is one &quot;WNDR3700&quot; and one &quot;WNDR3700v2&quot; available which differs in hardware requiring a different image file.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi golialive,</p><p>I forgot about this thread a while back. Really sorry about necro-ing this thread but I really wanted to say thanks. It helped and was exactly what I was looking for (the static leases).</p>									</div>
