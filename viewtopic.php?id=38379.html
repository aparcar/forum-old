					<p>Hi All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am using AP96 Board and using AR8316 Switch from Atheros. I have one Issue. I want to perform MII and PHY Loop back test in AP96 Board which has AR7161 Processor and AR8316 Ethernet switch. I found MII and PHY Loop back bit in AR8316&#039;s Registers. but don&#039;t know the exact steps and requirement to perform loop back test. Currently I have set those loop back bits and maid binary.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Problem is that when i run binary, Sometimes i get successful execution of loop back test and sometimes it fails. I don&#039;t know the reason behind this random behaviour. If you know anything regarding this then please provide me your valuable help.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let me know if any other information required.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Amit Bhorania</p>									</div>

					<p>There are two level loopback test:mac level and phy level.Some days ago,i use the atheros ar8021 giga phy and do the loopback test on it,i set the ar8021 regiser let it enter the loopback mode,and then write a loop,in the loop,first tx a packet and then rx a packet,what you rx is what you tx,and no tx packet lost.you can define the loop count or loop time,if no packet lost and no packet error,you can think the loopback test pass.</p><p>But if you wan to test a switch,i think you can do it by devide vlan,different port in different vlan,work as different interface in linux,and then connect port 1 and port 2 with etherent cable,port 3 and port 4 with ethernet cable.then write a loop tx/rx packet between different interface,in this way you don&#039;t need care the loopback register in the switch.</p><p>i don&#039;t know which test is better,maybe the &quot;vlan&quot; way is good than the phy level loopback test,but just maybe ...</p>									</div>
