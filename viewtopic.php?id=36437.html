					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I bought a WZR-HP-AG300H router a week ago, and installed to it OpenWRT (trunk+svn8603),<br />and I would like to share some comments about it.</p><p>The very first problem I met is the installation.<br />The link, <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-ag300h">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-ag300h</a> and <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr-hp-g300h#oem.installation.using.the.tftp.method">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wzr â€¦ ftp.method</a> , <br />described two methods to install OpenWRT,<br />i.e. through DD-WRT-Web interface or through TFTP.</p><p>However, it turns out only TFTP method can work. DD-WRT-Web interface will simply refuse to install the suggested OpenWRT image. Installing OpenWRT via TFTP is really is kind of difficult for me.&nbsp; Even with the instructions, I still ran into problems (almost give up for a few times...).&nbsp; So, here are we go...</p><p>First, turn off firewall.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Window 7 firewall is definitely blocking TFTP, and nothing <br />&nbsp; can be uploaded if firewall is on.</p><p>Second, get the network card Interface ID by running &quot;route print&quot; in console.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; The instruction in the web page is informative enough, but this <br />&nbsp; vital step is buried deep down the lengthy instruction.&nbsp; What had <br />&nbsp; happened is I copied and execute the commands in web page<br />&nbsp; for setting the temporary ARP route.&nbsp; Wrong Interface ID, TFTP goes nowhere...</p><p>Third, after power on the router, wait 10 seconds before TFTP sending.<br />&nbsp; Doing an important procedure like this blindfolded is very very scary.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; I usually need to try a few times for a successful TFTP upload.</p><p>Forth, restore firewall setting, the IP setting and the temporary ARP route<br />&nbsp; By the time I reached here at the first time, I was already exhausted and<br />&nbsp; missed some of the restoration.&nbsp; Messed up the network setting, cannot <br />&nbsp; go to internet.</p><p>Firth, install the web user interface, LuCI.<br />&nbsp; Nearly all routers came with user interface.&nbsp; I&#039;m almost take it for grant now.<br />&nbsp; However, OpenWRT doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; It requires me to install it afterwards via <br />&nbsp; Telnet console.&nbsp; Its very nice if you are an advanced user, but it is <br />&nbsp; extreme frustrating for me that a web UI didn&#039;t show up.&nbsp; Even worst,<br />&nbsp; no notes and no instruction is mentioning this.&nbsp; Just in case someone<br />&nbsp; need it...&nbsp; Log in telnet, and run the following to install/start LuCI.<br />opkg update;<br />opkg install luci;<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable;<br />/etc/init.d/uhttpd start;</p><p>Sixth, enable the wifi radio.<br />&nbsp; The wifi radio is disabled by default, which can be turned on via<br />&nbsp; LuCI at this point.&nbsp; (Why would I want a wireless router <br />&nbsp; with wifi disabled? Funny... )</p><p>Seventh, the driver for USB behaves strangely.<br />&nbsp; Nine out of ten times, the usb driver cannot be recognized at boot,<br />&nbsp; Adding &quot;sleep 15&quot; to fstab doesn&#039;t work.</p><br /><p>By the way,&nbsp; can anyone please tell me when would the flash image to<br />WZR-HP-AG300H be back?&nbsp; </p><p>Gary</p>									</div>
