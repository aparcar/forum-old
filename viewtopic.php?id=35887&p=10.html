					<p>Hello All. I Would love to test your version. I have a JetWay JNC9MGL-525 Intel Atom D525 (1.8GHz, Dual-Core) It have dual nic so you don&#039;t have to fight with usb adapters. It have none wlan adapter but I have a 1 x Mini PCIe port so I suppose it&#039;s possible to use something like this: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833106062&amp;Tpk=Mini%20PCIe">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a … ini%20PCIe</a></p><p>I&#039;m going to test your build.

					<p>Be careful, its generally only specific Atheros and Broadcom cards which support Access Point mode.&nbsp; Pretty sure none of the Intel WiFi chipsets have support for it.</p><p>The compatible Atheros chipsets should be:</p><p>AR5008:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR5418+AR5133 (&gt;= 2.6.27) AR5418 = DB 11n PCIe, AR5133 = 3x3 DB 11n<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR5416+AR5133 (&gt;= 2.6.27) AR5416 = DB 11n PCI<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR5416+AR2133 (&gt;= 2.6.27) AR2133 = 3x3 SB 11n </p><p>AR9001:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9160 (&gt;= 2.6.27) DB 11n<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9102 (&gt;= 2.6.30, AHB) 2x2 SB 11n<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9103 (&gt;= 2.6.30, AHB) 3x3 SB 11n </p><p>AR9002:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9220 (&gt;= 2.6.27, an AR9280 card over PCI) 2x2 DB 11n PCI<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9280 (&gt;= 2.6.27) 2x2 DB 11n PCIe<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9281 (&gt;= 2.6.27) 2x2 SB 11n PCIe<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9285 (&gt;= 2.6.29) 1x1 SB 11n PCIe<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9287 (&gt;= 2.6.32) 2x2 SB 11n PCIe </p><p>AR9003:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9380 (&gt;= 2.6.36) 3x3 DB 11n PCIe<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9382 (&gt;= 2.6.36) 2x2 DB 11n PCIe </p><p>AR9004:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9485 (&gt;= 2.6.39) 1x1 SB 11n PCIe<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AR9462 (&gt;= 3.2) 2x2 DB 11n</p><p>I highly recommend a 2x2 or 3x3 card, basically a 1x1 can do 150Mbit, 2x2 300Mbit and 3x3 450Mbit.&nbsp; Personally I am using <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=AR9280&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40">one of these</a> in 5Ghz mode, but it works equally well in 2.4Ghz (normal WiFi) mode too.</p><p>As for why I use USB network adapters, that is so that I do not waste gigabit ports in my network switch with low usage devices.&nbsp; </p><p>If you bridge several ethernet adapters together then it effectively becomes an ethernet switch.&nbsp; Yes it takes some of the CPU power, but as the Atom has plenty to spare and I am only using it for low bandwidth devices (one of which is the second port of my VDSL modem so I can telnet in and bring up the line stats, etc), its far better than wasting a full blown Gigabit port on the switch.&nbsp; </p><p>Also if you are only a couple of ethernet ports short, its a lot cheaper (about $3 a port if you get them from China via eBay) than having to upgrade an 8 port switch to 16 ports, which I would have to do as generally you are only supposed to have three unmanaged switches on an ethernet network.&nbsp; I already have three as its two routers (for two other WiFi networks) and an 8 port Gigabit switch.&nbsp; Obviously the routers I cannot swap out, the best you ever get is 5 ports on any router, so this was the only practical option.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello Guys,</p><p>I&#039;ve tested your version and It rocks! Great Job! keep working. Nevertheless I&#039;ve found something that it&#039;s important. The VPNC package is missing! I want to build that but to be honest my skills are far away to that. It would be awesome to have that package!. In my test I used a USB drive compatible with a dm9601.</p><p>thanks a lot!</p><p>Sebastián</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>seebaastian</strong> on 12 Jan 2013, 00:53)</p>
