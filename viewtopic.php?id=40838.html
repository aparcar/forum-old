					<p>Buffalo Tech introduced a new router.</p><p><a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/about-buffalo/news-and-press/press-releases/buffalo-updates-high-performance-wireless-router-lineup">http://www.buffalotech.com/about-buffal â€¦ ter-lineup</a></p><p>One person posted a message indicating it had the same amount of Flash and RAM as the WZR-HP-G300NH (32MB/64MB), which the above press release says the WZR-300HP is the replacing.&nbsp; The WZR-HP-G300NH is supported in Backfire.&nbsp; However, Buffalo technical support did not have the stats on the router and their information conflicted with the press release in which router it was based on.</p><p>Does anyone else own this router?&nbsp; Could you please post its hardware specs?&nbsp; Does it work with OpenWRT?&nbsp; Thank you.</p><p>Fred</p>									</div>

					<p>I got one and flashed it with the latest Attitude Adjustment, after getting a working serial cable to verify the results in case of a problem.&nbsp; It booted fine, and appears to function exactly the same as the previous model.</p><p>The DDR2 module is different since their previous part was end of life, which was probably enough to warrant a new board spin.</p><p>I have a boot log and whatnot added to the wiki.</p>									</div>
