					<p>I have a TL-WDR4300 router with OpenWRT installed. Every device on my network receives an IPv4 address from the router, and has its hostname correctly detected when the IPv4 address is assigned. Most of the devices also have IPv6 stacks, and these machines all receive IPv6 addresses. However, my laptop, while it receives an IPv6 address, does not have it&#039;s hostname properly detected. As a result, it cannot be reached by hostname over IPv6. As our ISP does not offer an IPv6 internet connection, it is not horribly important to have IPv6 working on the LAN, but ssh seems to default to using IPv6 addresses when both protocols are available, and as I have ssh access to the desktop restricted by hostname at present, ssh connections from the laptop to the desktop fail (though the rejected connection message in auth.log on the desktop seems to indicate that another factor is that the laptop is using a different IPv6 address than OpenWRT has for it in its list of DHCP leases). Ssh works without problems if I enforce the use of IPv4 with the &quot;ssh -4&quot;, but it&#039;s a bit annoying to have to stick that option in there.</p><p>I&#039;m not quite sure if the failure of hostname detection results from a configuration issue on the router or the laptop.&nbsp; Can anyone provide advice on what might be the problem here? The two devices whose hostnames are detected when assigning IPv6 addresses are my desktop (running Ubuntu 14.04) and an HP printer. The laptop is running Ubuntu 12.04.</p><p>As far as the laptop&#039;s failure to use the address that OpenWRT lists as assigned to it, I assume that this is probably a configuration issue on the laptop. Can anyone provide pointers on how to resolve it?</p>									</div>

					<p>Experimenting with an Ubuntu 14.04 LiveCD indicates that the laptop&#039;s hostname is detected when it&#039;s running 14.04. However, ssh still defaults to using an alternate IP address which is listed in the output to ifconfig, but is not the IP address that OpenWRT shows in its list of DHCPv6 leases. Both addresses, as before, are in fda3:f08f:1730::/48. I can use the -b option to ssh to enforce the use of the address that OpenWRT has on file, and this allows the hostname to be checked against hosts.allow, which allows an ssh connection to complete. Any idea what influences which IPv6 address ssh will use by default?</p>									</div>

					<p>That means you&#039;re using both SLAAC (the MAC-encoded address) and DHCPv6.&nbsp; The former is not &quot;assigned&quot; by the router, but is instead constructed by the client in response to the router advertising the prefix.&nbsp; The latter is assigned/tracked by the router, which is why it is the one with a DNS record.</p><p>The &quot;default&quot; outbound address is a pretty complicated matter, since it has to do with LFT expiration, width of the prefix, order of assignment...there are, in fact, a total of 12 rules used by the Linux kernel to determine which one is &quot;default&quot;.&nbsp; Add temporary (i.e. privacy) SLAAC addresses into the mix and it gets even more complex.</p><p>It&#039;d probably be simplest just to disable SLAAC on the client entirely and have done with it, thus you will always have a guaranteed DHCP-generated IP.</p><p>Rodney</p>									</div>
