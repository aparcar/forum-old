					<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I was looking around but couldn&#039;t find anything similar. Here&#039;s my situation:</p><p>I have two remote OpenVpn servers, which I want to use to tunnel traffic through.</p><p>My openwrt router will be serving as a client to both VPNs. All clients behind the router should be able to do the folowing:</p><p>Based on a setting (most probably the gateway ip), their traffic should either go through VPN Server 1, or VPN Server 2, or directly to the internet...</p><br /><p>Can I setup 3 IPs on the router, each one serving as a gateway for each of the destinations? (1 for VPN Server 1, 1 for VPN Server 2 and one for direct internet connection)</p><p>If there is another way to achieve this I am listening!!!</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mariosnic</strong> on 1 Feb 2013, 19:01)</p>

					<p>The openwrt gateway can&#039;t know which IP the client uses as gateway, only which MAC address/interface the packets are sent to.</p><p>Which means you need to use multiple interfaces, physical or VLAN. And use policy routing, like mwan3.</p>									</div>

					<p>It would be easier if you wanted to reach certain IP-addresses/networks via a given VPN server instead. It should only require one additional route for each IP-address or network you want to access via the VPN server, instead of using it as default gateway.</p>									</div>

					<p>Maybe mwan3 could work for you, or you have to setup something like this: <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.rpdb.simple.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-H â€¦ imple.html</a></p>									</div>

					<p>you can use policy routing via iproute2, e.g:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ip rule add from 192.168.1.10 table 10
ip route a default via tun1 table 10</code></pre></div><p>with iptables rules:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>iptables -t mangle -A zone_wan_MSSFIX -o tun1 -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
iptables -I FORWARD -s 192.168.1.10 -i br-lan -o tun1 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -d 192.168.1.10 -i tun1 -o br-lan -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.10 -o tun1 -j MASQUERADE</code></pre></div><p>this way client using ip address 192.168.1.10 will be going through OpenVPN tunnel&#039;s tun1</p><p>I&#039;m not familiar much with OpenWRT&#039;s firewall as of yet, but it might be more _proper_ to setup this in OpenWRT&#039;s firewall.</p><p>I&#039;m currently using /etc/firewall.user for that purposes mainly because of the combination of iptables rules and iproute tables.</p><p>Also you can use -j MARK feature to tag packets. Proper setup might involve creation of VLANs as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi toolame,</p><p>Thanks for the thoughts..</p><p>Based on your idea...</p><p>If I create an alias like below (router&#039;s ip is 192.168.2.1):<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config alias
  option interface &#039;lan&#039;
  option proto &#039;static&#039;
  option ipaddr &#039;192.168.2.2&#039;
  option netmask &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;</code></pre></div><p>and use iproute2 like you suggested, and in the client setup I put the alias ip as gateway... Would that work?</p><p>I cannot test it right now, because I am away on a trip... hopefully it will work, and then I can create 2 routed aliases for each vpn connection.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mariosnic</strong> on 5 Feb 2013, 21:39)</p>
