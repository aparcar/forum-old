					<p>I live in the UK, but I seem to have been sold a US model MBR624GU-100NAR.</p><p>I tried to upgrade the firmware to the latest non-US version from Netgear. I get &quot;Firmware upgrade failed&quot;. It seems that in their wisdom, Netgear will not allow a US model to be flashed with their &quot;Worldwide&quot; version of the firmware!</p><p>It occurred to me that it may be possible to flash to the worldwide version by first installing GPL firmware. Any suggestions?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nigelmercier</strong> on 1 Sep 2011, 21:10)</p>
