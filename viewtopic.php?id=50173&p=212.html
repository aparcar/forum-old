Your best bet is to download and flash a newer OpenWrt version from the command line, especially if you are able to get your WAN connection with DHCP. If you flash the 15.05-rc1 build, you should get a web GUI and then you can go from there.</p></blockquote></div><p>You have to install LuCI (after flashing a trunk image). <br />192.168.1.1 (Telnet)<br />opkg update<br />opkg install luci</p><p>Back to 192.168.1.1 to log in.</p>									</div>

					<p>@GV00</p><p>I had a problem going back to the latest factory firmware even resetting modem all it would display is a Linksys splash screen<br />that I could do nothing with. A reboot and reset and I was back at the useless screen. I did the 3 reboots and flashed the factory firmware again from openwrt but this time I installed the previous factory flash and it worked and updated to the latest factory.<br />You have to be hard wired. and reboot after installing then hold the reset until the power light flashes then go to 192.168.1.1 in your browser and set it up. After that I flashed again to the latest factory image and all went well. Good luck</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey guys, been following along forever but finally decided to chime in. First, Thanks a million to&nbsp; Kaloz ive been running his <br />CHAOS CALMER (Bleeding Edge, r45573) build for over a month with no major hiccups and no ttl cable. My question is before moving to the new 15 build, has anyone had major problems&nbsp; when doing on a root /overlay. have a 8gb usb with a good bit of packages. Is a sysupgrade somewhat safe or would it be better to reset everything; and flash from factory fm. Thanks</p>									</div>

Your best bet is to download and flash a newer OpenWrt version from the command line, especially if you are able to get your WAN connection with DHCP. If you flash the 15.05-rc1 build, you should get a web GUI and then you can go from there.</p></blockquote></div><p>You have to install LuCI (after flashing a trunk image). <br />192.168.1.1 (Telnet)<br />opkg update<br />opkg install luci</p><p>Back to 192.168.1.1 to log in.</p></blockquote></div><p>Looks like I&#039;m a few steps closer -- Thanks</p><p>Installed luci, and was able to log into 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Downloaded stock flash from Linksys, and Flashed new firmware image, but there&#039;s a problem.</p><p>This error message showed up -- </p><p>/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:433: Failed to execute function dispatcher target for entry &#039;/&#039;.<br />The called action terminated with an exception:<br />/usr/lib/lua/luci/util.lua:587: Unable to establish ubus connection<br />stack traceback:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [C]: in function &#039;assert&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:433: in function &#039;dispatch&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:168: in function &lt;/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:167&gt;</p><p>It looked like the Linksys image was in place, but the management page would not open...

					<p>Well technically bandwidth is throughput or speed.

					<p>Tested the following to see if Linksys &quot;Network Map&quot; is accurate or not.</p><p>1. Using Utorrent, download Ubuntu 14.4.2LTS<br />2. Throttled maximum download bandwidth to 2.8Mbps (350kBps)<br />3. Monitored the desktop interface using Resource Monitor.</p><p>Created a continuous stream at around 2.8 - 3Mbps, and verified that stream with Resource Monitor. There were slight variations in download, but Utorrent seemed to keep the download bandwidth throttled at around 2.8-3Mbps.</p><p>Linksys Network Map was in the ball park &#039;most&#039; of the time, but not always, using a 10 second polling cycle. </p><p>80% of the time would show somewhere around 2.8Mbps (Varying 1.5 to 4Mbps. (Just a rough guestimate)<br />20% of the time would show from 0Mbps to 10Mbps being used. Totally inaccurate readings.</p><p>I could have written each poll and plotted it in a graph, but I wasn&#039;t trying to be that scientific. The idea was to just get an idea of how accurate the so called Network Map is. It&#039;s not that accurate.</p><p>Bottom Line: Network Map would be good to use if trying to find out who is gobbling up all of the available bandwidth. Other than that, it&#039;s pretty much useless. </p><p>I realize this post would probably be better suited for the linksys forum. However, I want to take some time to evaluate the stock image before moving over to the open image. </p><p>My hope is that the Linksys WRT1900AC Open software is continuing to be worked on at a good pace. Because eventually, when it becomes really stable, I&#039;ll want to change over to it. </p><p>Best Regards,</p>									</div>
