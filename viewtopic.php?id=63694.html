					<p>Hi All,</p><p>I really need some help as I&#039;m a bit out of my depth.</p><p>I&#039;ve created my own OpenWRT package for Node.js. It works fine on raspberry pi 2, but raspberry pi 3 is my current mission and it seems to be having trouble.</p><p>When I select the Raspberry Pi 3 type it seems to fail when compiling the v8 source engine. It says this cpu type is not upported (looks like it&#039;s trying to use -march=armv8-a -mtune=cortex-a53)</p><p>Here is the error:<br />../deps/v8/src/base/atomicops_internals_arm_gcc.h:258:4: error: #error &quot;Your CPU&#039;s ARM architecture is not supported yet&quot;<br /> #&nbsp; error &quot;Your CPU&#039;s ARM architecture is not supported yet&quot;</p><p>That seems clear, cortex-a53 is not supported. So the question is, how can I over-ride the default compile flags and force a specific architecture (for example to force -march=armv8-a -mtune=armv8-a).</p><p>Really appreciate anybody&#039;s help here.</p>									</div>
