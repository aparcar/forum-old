					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I&#039;m using an OpenWRT module for my project where the module will communicate with some surrounding hardware, and data will be displayed to the user via the web ui, and should also be accessible from the WAN side. There will be a userspace application running on the module to control my hardware. I&#039;m no web developer, so I need some guidance on how to more easily develop the web part. Easiest for me seems to be the cbi approach, but the new web page tab needs to be refreshed every 500ms or 1s. LUCI has a builtin auto-refresh feature which should be good enough for me, but I can&#039;t figure out how to use that feature in the cbi approach. Another option could be that my userspace application updates an uci config file periodically, but does the web page auto refresh when my application executes an uci commit? I see most of the built-in luci modules use javascript and some XHR thingy for auto-refresh, but I&#039;m not sure, as I have no experience with javascript. Can someone please enlighten me?</p><p>Thank you already for your support</p>									</div>
