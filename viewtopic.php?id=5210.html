					<p>I was looking at the /etc/init.d/S45firewall script and I noticed the following three lines:</p><p>&nbsp; iptables -P INPUT DROP<br />&nbsp; iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP<br />&nbsp; iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT</p><p>My understanding is that the tables are handled sequentially, and so I&#039;m curious why the order isn&#039;t:</p><p>&nbsp; iptables -P INPUT DROP<br />&nbsp; iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT<br />&nbsp; iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP</p><p>It seems to me that in the average case, fewer invalid packets will appear than related or established packets, so why not evaluate them in the order that (seemingly) requires fewer tests?</p><p>If I were a betting person, I&#039;d bet that someone will explain to me why the first ordering is actually better than the second, rather than telling me that the second ordering is better.&nbsp; But I&#039;d like to understand why.</p>									</div>

					<p>Actually I believe your are correct.&nbsp; </p><p>The order would be more efficient the other way around.&nbsp; With connection tracking INVALID cannot happen at the same time as RELATED or ESTABLISHED, therefor there is no point in checking everything against INVALID first.&nbsp; If someone knows more on the inner workings of connection tracking please enlighten us.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey,</p><p>maybe it will prevent iptables to run out of memory, cause packets are also invalid if iptables runs out of memory.</p>									</div>
