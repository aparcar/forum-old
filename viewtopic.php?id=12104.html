					<p>I&#039;m working with a WRTSL54GS and have tried a few different devices on the USB port and they aren&#039;t detected but the hub within the router itself is.&nbsp; What program or kernel mod or package is responsible for detecting a USB device when it&#039;s plugged in?&nbsp; (This is on White Russian 0.9.)</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>No error messages.</p><p>I usually try to post solutions, but I&#039;ve been so busy I didn&#039;t keep up with this thread.&nbsp; I installed the ohci package (I think it was kmod-usb-ohci) and it worked.&nbsp; With all the HOWTOs I looked at and all the directions I was reading, not one mentioned including this package!&nbsp; I *think* I even saw a page that said it worked for USB 1.1 but to avoid for 2.0 so I may have misread something and misunderstood.</p><p>The problem I have now is if I unplug the speakers, then plug in another set or plug the same set back in, they are no longer recognized.&nbsp; That&#039;s the one thing I want to fix now before I write up what I&#039;ve done on my blog for future reference for others.&nbsp; I need some way to tell whatever handles the audio devices (and I have no idea what it is) that there is a new USB soundcard and to create the proper /dev info for it.</p>									</div>
