					<p>I have a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND router running OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1. I have installed Tinyproxy and can deny web requests to certain websites based on URL or regular expression. My filter file contains the following:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>.*google.*imghp.*
.*google.*tbm=isch.*</code></pre></div><p>This blocks all Google image search results. However, it&#039;s super easy to bypass the filter by using HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p><p>I&#039;ve read <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/391056/how-to-block-specific-https-traffic">this question on SuperUser</a>, which suggests to me that it is possible to block a web request using HTTPS based solely on the URL. However, adding <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a> to my filter file doesn&#039;t block it at all.</p><p>I had a hunch this had something to do with the &quot;ConnectPort&quot; option in Tinyproxy, so I removed port 443 from the list to no effect.</p><p>I understand that HTTPS traffic is encrypted, so typically a proxy can&#039;t do anything about it. However, the Tinyproxy website <a href="https://banu.com/tinyproxy/">clearly states</a> that it has HTTPS support:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Tinyproxy allows forwarding of HTTPS connections without modifying traffic in any way through the CONNECT method (see the ConnectPort directive).</p></blockquote></div><p>Unfortunately, the documentation on Tinyproxy is extremely sparse.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Manpages are the primary documentation for Tinyproxy. After installing Tinyproxy, run the following command to see its manpages:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>man tinyproxy tinyproxy.conf</code></pre></div></blockquote></div><p>The <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/tinyproxy.conf">Tinyproxy manpages</a> have very little to say about the ConnectPort directive:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p><strong>ConnectPort</strong></p><p>This option can be used to specify the ports allowed for the CONNECT method. If no ConnectPort line is found, then all ports are allowed. To disable CONNECT altogether, include a single ConnectPort line with a value of 0.</p></blockquote></div><p>So how can I achieve what I want?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>davidkennedy85</strong> on 12 Jan 2013, 08:41)</p>
