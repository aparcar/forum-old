					<p>Hi OpenWRT gurus!<br />I have read many tutorials and was following even more online samples for simple WiFi zone isolation inside.<br />What I want to achieve is allow Wireless users to browse web (80,443), get dhcp and dns from device itself, seems easy? Maybe <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> but none of tutorials on OpenWRT worked for me. Firewall setup in LUCI is well confusing - anybody can explain me purpose of &quot;Zones&quot; and &quot;Traffic Rules&quot; ? From my testing Traffic rules doesn&#039;t do match - Input (accept) and Output (accept) in &quot;Zones&quot; - overrides and wireless users can do what they want. I was trying to create &quot;Block All&quot; rule in &quot;Traffic rules&quot;, but no luck.. Also tested by making changes directly to config - but no luck..</p>									</div>
