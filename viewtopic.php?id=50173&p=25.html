Personally - and yes you ought to have your own opinion as well - I think it&#039;s very unprofessional to sell a product with features you can&#039;t deliver in the end. The correct way would have been to check whether the made marketing statements are legally backed-up. This would have prevented all the mess here.

I suppose there is probably a DD-WRT build for it, so maybe you&#039;re slightly better off.
