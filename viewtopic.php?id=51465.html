					<p>I finally started to run out of space on my v1 WNDR3700 so I&#039;ve started to play with extroot.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering what the &quot;best practice&quot; would be for installing packages.&nbsp; </p><p>Is it better to build a minimal image and then add packages once the USB overlay is working correctly or would it be better to build everything directly into the image.</p><p>I only ask because at the moment my image is so large that I keep getting &quot;out of space&quot; errors when I try to edit files (until I get the overlay working, then everything is fine).&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking it might be best to set up a minimal image (with just extroot support) and then add packages after installation.&nbsp; </p><p>Lastly, since I am building my image I think the packages that are installed from opkg are out of date.&nbsp; Is there a way to point to my locally built packages?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Comitizer</strong> on 5 Jul 2014, 17:34)</p>

As soon as you use extroot, you clone your current system to and afterwards work from the external device. Just keep in mind that your router&#039;s flash is &quot;frozen in time&quot; afterwards because any changes, adding/removing packages and changing configurations, will only be done to the extroot device. Which can be a good thing: Get your router set up with the basics, then extroot -- if you remove the extroot device, you fall back to the basic config on the router&#039;s flash. You can even quickly switch complete sets of configurations like that.</p><p>However, you can possibly avoid using extroot if you build a custom image complete with the packages you <em>know</em> you will use and keep. When the image is generated, all its files -- including the packages -- are compressed into the SquashFS partition. This makes quite a difference compared to installing the uncompressed packages afterwards.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 5 Jul 2014, 20:15)</p>

You generally have a larger RAM than your image size. So, if you build your own packages, you can download those later to your device and load them into RAM. As such, you can keep your image to minimum size.</p>									</div>

You don&#039;t have to build packages yourself to be able to host them on your own web server. Also, if you install packages into RAM, why is the image size relevant in the first place?</p><p>Also, while I don&#039;t have much experience with it, I would guess that the cases for installing packages into RAM are very limited and the overhead for its setup is considerable. Is this really a good recommendation for a common user (especially one asking for help with extroot)?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 5 Jul 2014, 20:41)</p>
