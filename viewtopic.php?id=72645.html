					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m probably asking too much, but it is the 21st century.</p><p>Currently I&#039;m using a technicolor ADSL wifi router switch which is mostly OK, except when it comes to filtering traffic. To keep our child away from Facebook and YouTube I route his traffic through a VPS in another city because I don&#039;t want to leave a computer on in addition to the wifi router just to do this task, seems like a waste of power.</p><p>So what I&#039;d like is a moderate system that can take ADSL input, and NAT to a switch/wifi, but also run a squid.</p><p>Could be satisfied if it requires a USB ADSL dongle.</p><p>Does anything exist on the market currently that can handle this sort of work load? Would Banana PI R1 be up to the task?</p>									</div>

					<p>The usual approach to this is to put the existing cheesy DSL modem into bridge mode, so it passes raw Internet to and from the DSL line to a pppoe Ethernet connection.&nbsp; Then any router can handle the routing, firewalling, VPN etc.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m trying to avoid multiple devices to reach the internet as we have limited power sockets and don&#039;t want to daisy chain power cables. At a push I could compromise the proxy component if it meant there was an openwrt device that that supported everything else I require so that I can control DHCP lease contents (and pop a pac file address in there, something that my current ISP provided device doesn&#039;t do).</p>									</div>

I think my line is rated at around 11mbps, so I won&#039;t be missing much, and at the price, I&#039;m willing to give it a go if I cannot find something that includes one already as there&#039;s no additional power supply required.</p>									</div>
