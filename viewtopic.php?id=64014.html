					<p>I have learned that one of the issues with manually changing the wifi file to a different STAtion is that the channel may not get changed.&nbsp; This would be the first thing I would check.&nbsp; In the Luci-Wifi screen, is the encryption filed blank?</p><p>Also as you do not give any details to your process, are you restarting the network function in some way.</p><p>The latest version of the wifiManger is here:<br /><a href="http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wifimgr-tool-to-automaticaly-select-an-apstation-from-a-list-of-saved-aps/#post-12684">http://www.gl-inet.com/forums/topic/wif â€¦ post-12684</a></p>									</div>

					<p>yes im aware of that the channel is correct everything in the luci looks normal and as for my method for editing the file i just use autoit to write a macro that open putty.exe and edit the file and after that do wifi down wifi up command </p><p>it does change the network successfully but it just dont even try to connect for some reason i even tried to reboot and nothing will happen</p>									</div>
