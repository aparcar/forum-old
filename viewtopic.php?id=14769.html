With side by side lists, I can see if anything else if different besides the Web^if package.</p><p>I&#039;ll run this command when I flash tonight and create a wiki page detailing the standard packages in the Xwrt Kamikaze 7.09 builds, and cross link it to the Xwrt wiki. If I do this, will someone edit the page on the openwrt wiki to add the standard OpenWRT packages in Kamikaze?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Arch13</strong> on 5 Mar 2008, 00:38)</p>
