					<p>Hi. I&#039;m new to OpenWRT, but have consulted the wikis and cannot seem to find an answer to this problem.</p><p>I flashed my WD N600 according to:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n600">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/wd/n600</a></p><p>I&#039;ve done it numerous times, and all with the same result..</p><p>The router will stop responding&nbsp; after a bit of time. Maybe 30 seconds to a minute after it starts pinging. This behavior occurred both before and after setting the root password in telnet; it&#039;s just luck it seems as to how much time I have before I get the boot. Powercycling restores the connection. Rinse and repeat. EDIT: I have found that it does eventually come and go in cycles if I leave everything powered on. I am always able to pull an IP regardless if the pings stop or not.</p><p>Does anyone know what may be going on here? I&#039;m not against it being a hardware problem: the router has a bad WAN port, so I thought I could make one of the lan ports into a WAN port, but the router just wants to kill the lan connection before I can do anything useful. I will say that I don&#039;t get this behavior with the oem firmware.</p><p>Thanks.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tonglebeak</strong> on 28 Apr 2014, 23:05)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ll try another trunk version I guess. I tried the one from 4 days ago and yesterday already.

					<p>Tried todays trunk, same deal. I can still pull an IP from the router throughout this process of losing ping responses. It pulls a 192.168.1.172/24 address, with 192.168.1.1 as the default gateway.</p>									</div>

					<p>That would be my first guess, too. Have you tried connecting directly to the N600, just one client machine straight into its LAN port (remember to turn off Wifi on the client machine)?</p><p>Other observations, I don&#039;t know how relevant they are:<br />a) DMESG says &quot;[&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.660000] eth0: link up (1000Mbps/Full duplex)&quot;, but the N600 doesn&#039;t have gigabit ports<br />b) The Wiki page instructs to install the sysupgrade image rather than the factory image, which is curious for the first install</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 30 Apr 2014, 13:01)</p>

					<p>I&#039;ve the router sitting on the couch next to me with only a laptop throughout this process. Wireless has been turned off every time. I tried the factory image afterflashing back to stock&nbsp; with the same result. These are clean flashes: the most I can do is change the password and get the dmesg if I&#039;m fast enough.

Blargh.</p><p>UPDATE: I had a second n600 with a busted wan port. Flashed and it&#039;s pinging fine, so I guess perhaps it is a hardware issue. STrange the problematic one works fine on stock as far as pinging. The only other difference is that this second one I tried got factory first, rather than sysupgrade.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>tonglebeak</strong> on 1 May 2014, 02:26)</p>
