					<p>Probably easier to understand in terms of internet connections</p><p>I think client mode is just for you in updating your system with opkg to get packages. and the cli programs like wget and using luci to update files with the gui. ( although there are probably other usages this one comes to mind )</p><p>Access point mode is for getting the internet to those who connect up to the router to gain internet access ( where that access is then served to clients who get the signal served to them via ethernet or wireless links that come into the router )&nbsp; &nbsp;(WDS is just a button on the router to get them to hook up more easily with other things like wireless dongles example Dlink dwa125 uses one to hook to other Dlink routers (not 3g modems) without using ip addresses and those type of hassles )</p><p>Ad-Hoc is just to connect one computer to the router when using it like a server ie you want to transfer files internally to your intranet (not internet) via the router.&nbsp; Although what pseudo means in this context i am unsure of.</p><p>Monitor maybe use in security context to duplicate the transmissions ? </p><p>glad to be corrected if i am wrong <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>ven.virupa</strong> on 29 Oct 2012, 22:01)</p>
