					<p>So a technical miracle occurred, and my Shield is finally working again. THANK YOU to those here because I&#039;m a total novice and would own a nice blue brick with fancy green lights were it not for you. Thanks so much for helping a stranger. So others may benefit form my pain, here&#039;s what finally fixed Shield in my case:</p><p>Problems I had: 1) No internet when shield between modem and router. It simply quit for no reason 2) Definition updates were old, and I could not get them udpated. 3) at times GUI inaccessible.</p><p>Solution:</p><p>When I could not get internet with shield between modem and Almond+ router, I connected ethernet between modem and router bypassing shield, except I left shield&#039;s eth1 plugged into an open slot on the router.</p><p>Shield GUI would fail, but I moved the ethernet cable from Eth1 to Eth0 for 10 seconds. Then moved it back to Eth1. That must jiggle the toilet handle somehow because then the GUI was again accessible. </p><p>I could see in GUI that I had v1.51 SP1 firmware, but definition updates were old (Nov 26)</p><p>I went to <a href="http://1drv.ms/1WU2Jaz">http://1drv.ms/1WU2Jaz</a> and downloaded the file there. Opened it, and simply copied it.</p><p>Went to startup menu choice option in GUI, and deleted what was there at the bottom of the page, pasting in the above.&nbsp; Save and apply changes.</p><p>Then via GUI, I hit the firmware update button. Let Shield do its thing for 10 minutes.</p><p>Lost GUI connection again, so moved from Eth1 to Eth0 for 10 sec, then put it back at Eth1. GUI available again. </p><p>Logged into GUI. Could see definitions were now updated Feb3! Ah, wonder of wonders.</p><p>reconnected modem -&gt; shield Eth0. And Shield Eth 2-&gt; router. A third connection from an open router ethernet port remains in Shield&#039;s Eth1. Shield remained powered up.</p><p>Unplugged router and modem. Waited 1 minute. Plugged in modem and allowed bootup.&nbsp; Then did the same for router.</p><p>Waited 5 more min. Internet connected!</p><p>GUI access still functioning. Start script for daily updates still in place. Now I just need to see if Shield will continue updating and working on its own</p><p>In the GUI I still have an error that says &quot;Oops, something went wrong. The last update didn&#039;t complete as expected. Shield will automatically try again to update itself again tomorrow. This message disappears automatically when the update is successful.&quot;</p><p>However, things seem to be working in spite of the message. So I have no idea what to try next. Just glad it works.</p><br /><p>Best,<br />-Rob</p>									</div>

Hardware being identical for the most part. However, Cujo is going for more automation and cloud-based updating - so similar risk with ITUS - if it &quot;goes down&quot; (out of business) we could be left with a toaster. They do not seem as &quot;open&quot; as ITUS - so I haven&#039;t placed an order, yet. The 5 pack seems to be the best deal, by far.</p>									</div>

					<p>Checking out that Cujo device.&nbsp; It is very similar to what the Shield does while in &quot;Gateway&quot; mode.&nbsp; Creates a controlled &quot;MITM&quot; situation on your local network, broadcasting itself as the gateway and pulling and inspecting all the traffic through it.&nbsp; </p><p>I agree, the shield is way better option since you have a full linux based device which can be run indefinitely, plus you have 3 options on how you wish to run it.&nbsp; </p><p>I hope ITUS can reorganize itself and resume operations.&nbsp; The market for this kind of device is ripe for the taking.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi, this is what CUJO support told me about there device compered to Shield</p><p>Greetings,</p><p>First, Kudos to Itus Networks for iGuardian. </p><p>Snort in-line (what seems to be their core technology) is going to be a challenge for them or the user, whomever has to set it up and provide updates for it long term.&nbsp; Filtering your network&#039;s traffic using rules that may or may not apply to your network is going to come at a performance cost.&nbsp; The more rules you load, the slower the performance.&nbsp; Not only that, we cannot tell if ITUS Networks will be supplying snort rule updates or if the user has to administer them.&nbsp; Are the updates free or is there a cost?</p><p>The CUJO is different in the sense that there&#039;s NOTHING to set up.&nbsp; You simply plug it into your router, power it on, and you&#039;re good to go.&nbsp; On the technology side, our key differentiator is our Behavioral Analysis in the CUJO Cloud.&nbsp; All the heavy lifting is done on the cloud.&nbsp; Our Behavioral Analysis platform will create rules specific to any malicious or suspicious traffic observed on your network.&nbsp; It&#039;s very targeted.</p><p>The Shield Pro seems to be several tools in a box.&nbsp; While this is great for the enthusiast or even a professional, it will be a burden for people who aren&#039;t technical or don&#039;t know how to use these tools to use the shield pro effectively.</p>									</div>
