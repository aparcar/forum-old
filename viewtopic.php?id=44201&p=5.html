					<p>Hi, is there anybody who already bought either a &quot;Sitecom WLR-8100&quot; or any other device with a v2 QCA9880 chip ?<br />If so, can you confirm that the ath10k driver is working properly on OpenWrt? What was your process of installing OpenWrt? Would be great if you could extend the Wiki.</p><p>Another question to the OpenWrt developer community: Which 802.11ac devices are expected to be supported by OpenWrt next? Are there any favorites / devices which will be supported most definitely in the future?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>clemens</strong> on 30 Aug 2013, 21:01)</p>

You can pick up some of those TV satellite dishes from scrap yards or the like, and since the transmitters use coaxial or BNC cable, you&#039;ll only need to get an adapter to the coax cable for the wifi antenna to attach to the router. Anyhoo, just point a couple of those at eachother. I&#039;ve gotten a mile line-of-sight out of that on 802.11g.</p><p>Downside to this is that FCC and other organizations will really frown upon it because it&#039;s WAY more signal strength than they&#039;re meant to put out. You&#039;ll also want to stick to the original firmware to do the linking between networks, set each one to a different IP address, then disable DHCP on all the routers except the one that&#039;s connected to your ISP.</p><p>You could buy directional antennas and point them at eachother, but they dont all have the same kind of range capability, and those cost more than going to a scrap yard</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello people, </p><p>First up I&#039;m really sorry about being so thick when it comes to this WDR7500 router. I&#039;m in awe of what you&#039;re able to do hacking hardware for OpenWRT. I purchased the WDR7500 to put OpenWRT on, and learn. </p><p>The problem is that I&#039;ve scoured the Internet, studied this thread and the OpenWRT wiki, loaded versions of tftpd onto a windows and a linux machine and tried to get a transfer going during the router boot sequence. None of this has worked. I simply don&#039;t know enough to get the combination or sequences correct. For example I&#039;ve not witnessed the ttl change from 64 during boot. </p><p>I know there is lots of advice on this thread, and if I had more experience, I would be able to follow it and flash the router, but unfortunately, it hasn&#039;t worked and I have spent days in frustration not knowing what to do. </p><p>I&#039;m wondering if someone who knows the exact process for flashing a chinese firmware WDR7500, to an English OpenWRT firmware could please give an up to date step by step dummies guide. <br />I&#039;ve tried making tftpd work but nothing happens. What are the steps, what are the exact commands to issue? </p><p>Thank you sooo much <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Don</p>									</div>

					<p>@qc/Don<br />I can recommend to hook up a serial interface via a little hardware hack, it is quite easy to do and will give you great power over your router under most circumstances. Once you have the serial connection running you can execute the magic commands to flash another firmware. This is what I did on my Chinese WDR7500 (6 antenna version), and it is working very well.<br />Another option is to build a custom firmware that can be flashed from within the official firmware, but I can tell you that it is quite easy to lock yourself out and I found that recovery is not as easy as it sounds. Without a serial interface I would have been lost.</p>									</div>
