					<p>Does anybody happen to have a known working image for a Fritzbox 7170? I&#039;ve tried quite a few builds, but I can&#039;t seem to get one running on the device. It&#039;s especially unclear to me whether I should add a checksum (with tichksum) to the build or not. I&#039;ve tried multiple scripts and using ftp manually to get the image onto the device. When I read the image back from the device, the md5sums match, so I&#039;m sure that there&#039;s no problem with the flash chip in the Fritzbox.</p><p>When I try to build OpenWRT from trunk I get of errors like:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>tree-mudflap.o:(.rodata+0xe8): undefined reference to `gt_ggc_m_P9tree_node4htab(void*)&#039;<br />tree-mudflap.o:(.rodata+0xf0): undefined reference to `gt_pch_n_P9tree_node4htab(void*)&#039;</p></blockquote></div><p>Should I open a ticket for that? My system is a pretty standard Ubuntu Trusty installation, so I think it&#039;s a FTBFS bug.</p>									</div>
