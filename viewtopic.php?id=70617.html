					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I just investiaged and found something confusing.</p><p>Seems like &quot;Save and Apply&quot; in LuCI doesn&#039;t recreate the same state as &quot;/etc/init.d/firewall restart&quot; does.</p><p>My WAN side is another router of type FRITZ!Box making &quot;192.168.178.0/24&quot; the IP range of my WAN port and 192.168.178.1 te upstream gateway for my OpenWRT router.<br />Here I want my local LAN devices not to be able to access this IP address directory. I consider this device to be part of my ISPs network even though it&#039;s located in my basement. So I created a &quot;deny&quot; rule keeping my LAN devices out. </p><p>That&#039;s the rule:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config rule
        option name &#039;disble fritzbox&#039;
        option dest_ip &#039;192.168.178.1&#039;
        option family &#039;ipv4&#039;
        option src &#039;*&#039;
        option dest &#039;wan&#039;
        option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
        option dest_port &#039;64-1024&#039;
        option target &#039;REJECT&#039;</code></pre></div><p>When I go to LuCI http://router/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/firewall/rules, I can switch this rule on and off and hit &quot;Save and Apply&quot; at the bottom.</p><p>Switching this rule off makes my LAN clients being able to connect to http//192.168.178.1<br />Switching this rule on again does *not* make my LAN clients being unablge to connect. They still can access the FRITZ!Box.<br />When I ssh to my OpenWRT to call &quot;/etc/init.d/firewall restart&quot; the &quot;off&quot; applies and my LAN clients stop being able to access the FRITZ!Box.</p><p>That&#039;s what I do:<br /></p><ul><li><p>/etc/init.d/firewall restart</p></li><li><p>Don&#039;t have access to 192.168.178.1</p></li><li><p>Go to http://router/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/firewall/rules</p></li><li><p>Disable that deny rule</p></li><li><p>Hit &quot;Save and Apply&quot;</p></li><li><p>Have access to 192.168.178.1</p></li><li><p>Enable that deny rule</p></li><li><p>Hit &quot;Save and Apply&quot;</p></li><li><p>Still have access to 192.168.178.1</p></li><li><p>/etc/init.d/firewall restart</p></li><li><p>Don&#039;t have access to 192.168.178.1</p></li></ul><p>I have no clue what&#039;s causing this. When comparing &quot;iptables-save&quot; in between there&#039;s nothing suspicious at all.</p><p>Could you please check that on your setup?<br />Maybe it&#039;s not the question of &quot;how can I overrule the global ALLOW&quot; but more a bug of &quot;LuCI doesn&#039;t properly reload firewall&quot;?</p><p>[edit]</p><p>Ah, it&#039;s somehow about the difference between &quot;reload&quot; and &quot;restart&quot;.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 18 Apr 2017, 20:55)</p>
