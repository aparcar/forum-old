					<p>Hello, I&#039;m developing a Battery Simulator script for openwrt.</p><p>The objective is to set this script at init.d and leave it running. The problem is I didn&#039;t found any documents about how to get return variables, flags or Signals that indicates when the router is in transmiting status, reveiving status or idle status. I need those because depending on the router status, the battery would drain faster or slower.</p><p>Someone knows where can I found this kind of info? I&#039;ve already checked all the openwrt wiki and documents and there is only the config options, not the API documents.</p><p>Thanks.</p>									</div>
