					<p>Hi!<br />I manage an large wifi network at my school. I have a simple topology with an router and many AP&#039;s (all with openwrt).&nbsp; Wifi network is open for teachers and students but I have problems with ip conflicting because I need certain computers in the network have fixed ip. Some are a long way from the router and can not use different physical links.<br />Because wifi network is open, some students, intentionally or not, setup their device with fixed ip and thus problems with IP address conflict. How can solve these problems?<br />One idea is to configure a secure WiFi network, with another class of IP addresses that use the same physical network with the open network. But I do not know what to do next?</p>									</div>

					<p>DHCP snooping. Some managed switches offer this feature (Netgear has quite a few).</p><p>If you don&#039;t want to buy a bunch of managed switches, another solution is to use <a href="https://github.com/michael-dev/ebtables-dhcpsnooping">this dhcp snooping daemon</a>. however this is non-trivial. You&#039;ll need to cross compile it for OpenWrt and also enable ebtables on OpenWrt, which has a performance impact. You&#039;ll need to build your own image from source</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>I&#039;d go for the exact implementation you suggest:</p><ul><li><p>Create a new vlan within your router and all your APs.</p></li><li><p>Connect your APs to the router by wire (as you most certainly have at the moment).</p></li><li><p>Make that connections &quot;tagged&quot; on all ports of all APs and the router as well and allow both vlans, the existing LAN and the Internal LAN.</p></li><li><p>Set up&nbsp; different IP range on the router interface</p></li><li><p>Put the new internal LAN to the very same firewall group as the existing LAN.</p></li><li><p>Now put another SSID on all your APs and bind it to the new vlan.</p></li></ul><p>That should be it.</p><p>The most simple thing about DHCP snooping can be done by a simple cron job. Put all MAC addreses of your routers ARP table (on your LAND bridge, of course) in an array, drop all the MAC addresses that match your DHCP leases table and disconnect the remaining. That doesn&#039;t give you the best protection in the world but it&#039;s most likely enough for those students that just don&#039;t know a thing about networking but think stting fixed IPs is either funny or somehow better in terms of performance.</p><p>[edit]</p><p>Just to make things clear, I&#039;m talking about something like this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh

arp=$(cat /proc/net/arp | grep br-lan | awk &#039;{ print $4}&#039;)
dhcp=$(cat /tmp/dhcp.leases | awk &#039;{ print $2}&#039;)

for mac in $arp ;
do
        if [ &quot;$dhcp&quot; == &quot;${dhcp/$mac/}&quot; ]
        then
                echo $mac manually
        else
                echo $mac dhcp
        fi
done</code></pre></div><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>golialive</strong> on 11 Nov 2016, 01:04)</p>

					<p>Thanks Stephan!</p><p>Now question for 1000$: in my network i have few AP from tp-link, i think that is WA-901ND or something like that. I don&#039;t see in network config any switch option to configure VLAN. Is possible to create multiple vlan on these AP?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey there.</p><p>If they run TPlink stock firmware: Most likely not. If they run OpenWRT (I don&#039;t know if your devices are capable of), sure.</p><p>For that exact purpose I use a couple of low cost TPlink routers (not APs) that can run OpenWRT.<br />I have three 4900, one 3600 and one 1043v1. One 4900 acts as router, the other devices have all routing disabled, DHCP disabled and only act als vlan switches adding wifi to vlans.</p><p>This set up spans four different SSIDs and six different vlans: Private LAN, guest LAN, SmartTV and meda devices, VOIP (which has no wifi), services (printers and storages, which has no wifi as well) and SmartHome.</p><p>Advantage of those device over regular APs: They usually have five GBit LAN ports. One of them is for &quot;tagged vlan input&quot; (== trunk uplink), the other four can be individually configured to expose a distinct vlan (as &quot;untagged&quot;).</p><p>Another thing about having devices with several LAN ports over devices with one single LAN port: You can have one LAN port for maintenance pinned to &quot;untagged VLAN1&quot; while having an additional one as &quot;tagged uplink&quot;. Since the APs have only one LAN port: If you make that &quot;tagged vlans uplink&quot; this thing immediately stops responding to untagged input like if you simply connect a wired computer to it for maintenance purposes.</p><p>So my suggestion would be to dispose the APs (like putting them on ebay or something) and get yourself a couple of well supported OpenWRT capable routers.</p><p>How do we arrange payment? I prefer bitcoins <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" />.</p><p>Regards,<br />Stephan.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks!<br />Also in my network i have an TP-Link wdr4300 as main router and 3 routers (1043v1 and two others with routing disabled, act as dump AP) but also i have and two AP. Now, realize that AP are not very significant for my topology because what I want to protect it outside the range of the two AP&#039;s. On main router i have three vlan&#039;s. One for LAN and two for WAN because i have two modems. Everything work, but still don&#039;t understand very well these terms like tagged or untagged.<br />I double the money: can u put some config files with your VLAN? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /> I need only for two like private and guest.</p><p>@ckam: interesting but i need to read more. It&#039;s seem to be a little to more for what i need.</p>									</div>
