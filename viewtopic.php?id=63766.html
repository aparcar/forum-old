					<p>I got a Linsys WRT1200AC and I like to use it as a Wi-Fi Range Extender. I have OpenWrt installed on it. Lots of settings. Is there a <strong>restore backup</strong> that I can download to set it all up. Or any one have a video or a link how to set it up as a Wi-Fi Range Extender.</p><p>I know it has lots of setting can do so I guess it can be set up like this.</p><p>I like it to work like the Linksys AC1200 MAX. Were it just is like a WiFi <strong>switch</strong> and it auto gets a DHCP address on my LAN. So it don&#039;t give out IP address&#039;s.</p><p>To plug in to my LAN on the internet Ethernet port and the other 4 Ethernet ports to be like a Gigabit switch.</p><p>To do auto pick the best WiFi channels not just pick one.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/bridgedap">I looked here</a>. But that is setting it up for a static IP.</p><p>-Raymond Day</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>raymondday</strong> on 29 Mar 2016, 02:59)</p>

					<p>I was trying to set it up and thought I had it and rebooted it to see if I would get my land IP because it said bridge on the LAN. But I can&#039;t connect to it now.</p><p>Guess I have to put a RS232 in it. Or can it be reset by the reset it back?</p><p>Or if the RS232 were is a place to order the 6 pin JST PH6 connector?</p><p>-Raymond Day</p>									</div>

What device, and more importantly, what chipset?</p><p>The ideal situation for setting up an OpenWRT device as a WiFi extender is when the main router/AP is also running OpenWRT on a device capable of running 4-address mode, which includes Most Qualcomm/Atheros devices, the MediaTek/Ralink devices I&#039;ve tried, and probably most everything else, EXCLUDING broadcom.</p><p>Assuming that is the case, configure the main router so that the access point is configured as &quot;Access Point (WDS), rather than just &quot;Access Point.&quot;&nbsp; Reset the new device. Configure the LAN (br-lan) interface with a static IP in the range of your main network, so you can always connect to it. Disable the DHCP server on the LAN interface. From here, you should be able to set it as a bridged-client using WDS, similarly to the description here (not limited to Atheros devices): <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds</a></p>									</div>
