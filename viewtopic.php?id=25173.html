					<p>Does anybody know if openwrt supports WMM in ad-hoc mode?</p><p>I did some tests with whiterussian 0.9 and Backfire 10.03 using some Linksys WRT54G routers. It worked well in the infrastructured mode, but it seems there is no difference between best effort and qos traffics in the ad-hoc mode, even with dscp fields marked properly.</p><p>Would be possible to develop this functionality also for the ad hoc mode? How could I do it?</p><p>Thanks,<br />emineiro</p>									</div>
