					<p>I need a little/lot of&nbsp; help I am new to openWRT. I have installed whiterussian 0.9. On a Linksys Wrt54GL v1.1. I need to configure the router&nbsp; as a test bed for two OS X servers mimicking a larger network. I would like to have both servers connected but each in it&#039;s own Vlan (ie port 1 IP&#039;S 192.168.2.X and port 2 IPS 192.168.1.X). Each ethernet interface serving dhcp. I then need the two separate vlans to be able to communicate... I could PING 192.168.2.5 from 192.168.1.5&nbsp; while&nbsp; both networks connect to the outside world via the WAN port.<br />please help this is a dire emergency and money is well non existent I do not think I can get my boss to buy a layer 3 switch for test. Any help would be much appreciated.<br /> Not a coder so please go slow.</p>									</div>

					<p>I suggest first reading this tutorial on vlan <a href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/view/30071/54/">http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/view/30071/54/</a> In the webif^2 (if you installed X-WRT) you can define some additional vlan. Setting all routing etc and iptables I think still has to be done by hand. There is some info in the wiki look for &quot;ethernet switch configuration&quot; or vlan.</p>									</div>
