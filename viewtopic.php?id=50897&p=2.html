					<p>@thomasthomas your work it&#039;s amazing. I&#039;m very interested on it cause it&#039;s high performance hardware. For me it&#039;s more important OpenWRT than RouterOS cause then I can use Ansible and FWBuilder. Hope to hear from you more news about your tilera port.</p>									</div>

					<p>Cool! Nice to see some interesting responses on this project. I have been stuck with travel and other projects in the past few months and it seems the email notification function of this forum is not working.<br />Around hardware I was forced to move towards OpenNSL/ONIE based switches and Intel DPDK/openvswitch routers/servers to have some progress in my POC. For now this is OK as I do not see any CCR1072-1G-8S+ yet (gigabit is boring).</p><p>Lack of hardware is something I could potentially solve. I have 2 spare/unused toys (CCR1036-8G-2S+EM). Let me see if I can find a server with serial ports and free network ports that can be linked towards the BOOT/ETH8 port.<br />Getting the USB ethernet to work might be nice as well as we could load/unload the tilegx kernel module using ssh <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" />.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Guys,<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I work on tilera board TilePro64 processor, during one of the trials, i accidentally flashed a default bootroom on the working device.Now am not able to access the board using ssh. Not sure how to debug or reboot the board further. Any of have experience in bringing up the board, kindly share your inputs, so that i can bring it back to working stage..</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently received one of these from a friend. I am working on this as well. I have figured out a little more about how the boot image is put together and have been able to increase the kernel space available as well as include an initramfs inside of the boot image.<br />I am working on getting the nand recognized by the kernel.</p><p>I will update this with my progress.</p>									</div>

					<p>I am still working on this project, using the tools from fgrep as a base I have been able to create a tool to put any size kernel images or initramfs file into a netbootable mikrotik format. The USB does not work out of the box with the kernel patches provided but it is a one line fix:</p><p>in arch/tile/rb/setup.c replace<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>set_gpio(0, GPO_USB_POWER);</code></pre></div><p>with<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>set_gpio(GPO_USB_POWER, GPO_USB_POWER);</code></pre></div><p>That fixed USB for me. I am also playing around with the MicroSD card slot. <br />I will be posting my tools soon in hopes others find them useful.<br />If someone would like to get in contact with me directly, you can find my email on my github page: <a href="https://github.com/protraf-josiah">https://github.com/protraf-josiah</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>josiah2009</strong> on 16 Oct 2015, 20:32)</p>

					<p>Hi everyone, <br />i &#039;m working on tilera board TilePro64 processor and i want to cross compile some application. If you have any idea of how i can do it i&#039;ll be very thankful. <br />Ps : i use the MDE(multicore Development Environment ) and there is a lot of Linux command witch doesn&#039;t exist here. <br />Thank you .</p>									</div>
