					<p>I have a TP-LINK WDR6500 v2, bought in China.<br />I believe that I have managed to flash the firmware showed on its wiki page (factory version) into it, but I&#039;m not 100% sure if I actually succeeded.</p><p>And I tried to putty login, but neither telnet or ssh would connect. The error message was connection timeout.</p><p>Also, ping 192.168.1.1 would sometimes return immediately, sometimes get a reply from 192.168.1.2 saying 1.1 is not reachable.</p><p>What is the problem?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>virgilming</strong> on 28 Aug 2016, 18:08)</p>
