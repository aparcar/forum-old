					<p>Well, dnmasq definitely is running on my rounter. It properly resolves the currently connected DHCP leases (domain names &lt;lease hostname&gt;.lan)</p><p>Here&#039;s the dnmasq-related part from the /etc/config/dhcp file:</p><p>config dnsmasq<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option domainneeded &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option boguspriv &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option localise_queries &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option rebind_protection &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option rebind_localhost &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option local &#039;/lan/&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option domain &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option expandhosts &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option authoritative &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option readethers &#039;1&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option leasefile &#039;/tmp/dhcp.leases&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option resolvfile &#039;/tmp/resolv.conf.auto&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option localservice &#039;1&#039;</p><p>My /etc/dnsmasq.conf file has all options commented out. I don&#039;t want to experiment with those settings afraid to get in conflict with those of the dhcp config file.</p><p>But it does not resolve the domain names defined in the router&#039;s /etc/hosts file. Is there some other setting in some config file to enable that? In the OpenWrt wiki doc (&lt;they don&#039;t let me to post link&gt;/doc/howto/dhcp.dnsmasq) it does not say I have to explicitly enable the lookup from /etc/hosts file.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks, it was actually the<br />/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart<br />that I had to do. I wasn&#039;t aware that the newly added entries to /etc/hosts file will not be immediately available without restarting dnsmasq.</p>									</div>
