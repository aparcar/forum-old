					<p>I installed the Openwrt image on my router. I can access the control panel for the router but have no internet access. Th WAN IP is 0.0.0.0. I tried tweaking various settings in the control panel and restarting the router and the modem but no help. My isp is Comcast if that matters.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>rezrez</strong> on 29 Aug 2015, 04:31)</p>

					<p>Hi. I turned the modem off, connected to the running router then turned it on and the problem was solved. Apparently this is required to close the MAC successfully.</p>									</div>
