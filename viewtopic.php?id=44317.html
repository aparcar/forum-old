					<p>hmm too bad i didn&#039;t save the whole distro at the time; i guess now its impossible to find packages anywhere; i&#039;ll try check U-boot version trough serial console.. and stick with RC6 (for now) if not supported.</p><p>ty for your help</p><p>edit:</p><p>my loader U-Boot 1.1.4 (Aug&nbsp; 4 2010 - 20:06:51) AP83 (ar9100) U-boot 0.0.11 # same version as the bugged one different dates</p><p>i&#039;ve tested attitude adjustment 12.09-rc2 all seems fine just too much memory allocated to cache(leaves me with 700kb free; installed vsftpd)</p><p>on the good side, packages from 10.03.1 work with 10.03.1-rc6 so another fun project..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>makarel</strong> on 23 May 2013, 20:12)</p>
