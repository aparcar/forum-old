					<p>Which binary file did you try uploading? I did this a few days ago, and the correct file ( openwrt_wnr3500l_8.09.2.chk ) did NOT get built by default - it was missing from the bin directory. This was confusing, since there were a number of &quot;.bin&quot; files in that directory which looked like they might be an upload image. Somewhere on this forum (I don&#039;&#039;t have the link handy now() I found instructions to patch the make script to build the wnr3500 output.</p>									</div>
