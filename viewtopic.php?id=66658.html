I have a TL WR-543G ver 2.0 and I am interested in installing Openwrt. This model does not appear in the official list of supported routers but from the above discussion I understand that it is possible to install openwrt using the procedure for TL-WA5210G v2 with some modifications. Is this true? TL-WA5210G v2 is not listed in the supported router list either, hence the need for the &#039;modified Step1_v2.bin&#039; in comparison to TL-WA5210G v1, right?</p><p>As this is going to be my first openwrt flash, can you please summarize the steps required? E.g. a link to the procedure/instructions to the documented procedure (e.g. for TL-WA5210G v1) along with the necessary modifications needed for WR-543G.</p><p>As a last note, from the files mentioned in the thread, the two files hosted in 4shared are still available but the file in mediafire is not, so if it is needed, I will need help on it.</p>									</div>
