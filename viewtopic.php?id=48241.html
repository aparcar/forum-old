					<p>Maybe just my opinion, but it&#039;s much easier to maintain journalistic integrity if you site sources. He doesn&#039;t have to quote the press release, but it&#039;s his responsibility to convey factual information to the public. In my opinion, specifying that it will run DD-WRT is misinformation based on the press release from Linksys.</p><p>Thanks for the link to the Almond+ it looks promising. Hopefully it lives up to the information they&#039;ve provided and can maintain a $100 price point. The Airfy is interesting but seems like the wrong product for a crowd-funding site.</p><p>Anyway, I think it&#039;s exciting that Linksys is opening their doors. How far they open them will be the important part. The only other problem I see is the $300 price point which seems a little steep.</p>									</div>

					<p>The Almond+ mentioned earlier (Wifi Router with Touchscreen and Home-Automation with Zigbee)<br />has its hardware changed and is using QCA radios - so it might work with OpenWrt.<br />BUT there is a catch - it&#039;s using a Cortina Systems CS7542 (because QCA SoC was not powerful enough)<br />source: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7700/securifis-almond-platform-update-integrates-cortina-soc-with-qca-radios">anandtech</a></p><p>I dont know if there is support in the linux kernel for Cortina CPUs(ARM) now.</p><p>Wikidevi/pc-world lists Marvell as potential Wifi candidate for WRT1900AC.<br />However their drivers do not seem to support MESH/ADHOC (mwl8k) or AP modes (libertas) - it might be firmware dependent.<br />Since the firmware is closed source (like ath10k) there is no easy way to implement these features I suppose.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve been lurking WRT1900AC related topics all over the net for a while now and the situation is pretty disappointing. Like an idiot, I bought one based on Linksys&#039; promises of OpenWRT compatibility without verifying that at the OpenWRT site. &lt;sigh&gt;</p><p>The current situation is especially frustrating because you can just feel the potential of the hardware on this device. With the stock firmware it&#039;s blazing fast and the wireless is amazing. The real kick in the nuts though is the factory firmware. It&#039;s so feature crippled and dumbed down as to be insulting. How could they ship such a feature lacking, dumbed down firmware to the type of customer that would want a $300 router promised to be capable of alt firmware? It&#039;s like some kind of horrible bait and switch. Hell, you can&#039;t even check (let alone set) AP Isolation.</p><p>OK, all that said is to lead up to this. And this is going to make some people mad, but here it goes.</p><p>I&#039;d much rather have a WRT1900AC with OpenWRT that runs perfect, fast, and stable and doesn&#039;t give up any speed or features but uses a binary blob than have something hacked together that gives up performance, features and stability.<br />Of course the ideal solution is for Marvell to release a fully working, no compromise, source driver for the 88W8864. However if that weren&#039;t to happen, I&#039;d much rather integrate a binary blob than either a crippled F/OSS driver from Marvell or some other workaround from the community. It&#039;s not a perfect F/OSS world and there are not perfect solutions. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst.<br />With that in mind, if Linksys/Belkin fail to get Marvell to commit to releasing the driver, is there anyone willing to negotiate with them to build blobs configured for current OpenWRT kernels?<br />I don&#039;t care if this results in an offsite, unofficial OpenWRT fork for the WRT1900AC. I&#039;d rather have a working device than a $300 heartache.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>									</div>

					<p>Your construction OpenWrt somehow &quot;is not ready for the router&quot; shifts the blame on OpenWrt. <br />I fail to see any argument that could support this because the Announcement clearly came from Linksys/Belkin. &quot;They&quot; are the first that have capabilities to act. It was outlined here and on the mailinglist how. &quot;They&quot; failed at that. </p><p>In the EU misleading product information/labeling can have legal consequences.</p><p>The &quot;technically true&quot; argument reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Yerevan_jokes">Radio Yerevan jokes </a> ...</p><p>btw:<br /></p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>Open Source Ready</p><p>While the Linksys WRT1900AC provides an outstanding experience via SMART Wi-Fi immediately out of the box, advanced users can further modify the router, which will have Open Source firmware available. Developed for use with OpenWRT, an open source, Linux-based operating system, the router offers an additional layer of customization to suit an individual&#039;s needs.</p></blockquote></div><p>current homepage ...</p><p>It is possible for them to make a &quot;Broadcom like&quot; agreement with DD-WRT and use that. They did not do that. So calling them out for failing to deliver is only fair since they are&nbsp; commercially using and hijacking OpenWrt so far without giving back in the first place.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>zloop</strong> on 12 Jun 2014, 19:16)</p>
