					<p>I have a LAN at home (192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) and have a VPS server with SQUID installed and working, this VPS is outside my LAN, with a public IP.</p><p>I have a PC at home, with ip 192.168.0.2 and I need this PC to go through the squid proxy, always.</p><p>So I want to know how to configure my home router with OpenWrt to force all traffic from my PC to go to the squid proxy.<br />If I change the &quot;internet explorer&quot; connections settings and set up the squid proxy address and port (3182) there, then it works, and this PC gets &quot;out to internet&quot; through my squid proxy. But I need this configuration to be handled by the OpenWrt powered router.</p><p>I hope someone can guide me.</p><p>Thanks a lot!!</p>									</div>
