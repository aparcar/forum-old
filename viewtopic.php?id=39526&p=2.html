					<p>Hi.. I&#039;m totally new to openwrt. We have a project that we are trying to make WR703N with AAA&#039;s billing feature (e.g. coova-Chilli). Is it possible? We managed to flash the latest openwrt (Barrier Breaker) into WR703n but we are not able to install coova-chilli (coova-chilli_1.2.5-1_ar71xx.ipk under backfire/10.03.1/ar71xx/packages/). Please help.. Thanks in advance..</p>									</div>

					<p>Why do you think it is bricked? How are you trying to connect to the router?</p><p>If you are really in AP+client mode initially you have to access the router through the ethernet port. The router IP address is 192.168.2.1 unless you have changed it.</p><p>Did you use the right command to change the mode?</p><p>I doubt the router is really bricked. In the worst case I guess the failsafe mode should always work.
