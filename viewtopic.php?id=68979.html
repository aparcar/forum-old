					<p>Have a TP-Link CPE210(EU) V1.1 which doesn&#039;t boot anymore. Please help!<br />Initially I installed OpenWrt r49388. It does work. Then I tried to upgrade to the latest OpenWrt. After restart the system it doesn&#039;t boot anymore. No connect via 192.168.1.1.<br />Then I tried to do a factory recovery with factory image of TP-Link.<br />System requests the recovery.bin file in tftp32 and the transfer of the file went ok so far. But after that the unit requests for a &quot;vmlinuz&quot; file.Seethe following tftp listing:<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Connection received from 192.168.0.254 on port 4011 [17/12 22:57:46.840]<br />Read request for file &lt;recovery.bin&gt;.

					<p>CPE210 has serial headers, connect to it and see what boot messages you get. There are lots of information on forum and on the wiki how to get serial connection working.</p>									</div>

					<p>or serial. Not both.Thanks for reply. I already connected via serial port to the unit. 115200, 8, n, n With putty I got he following string after starting the router:</p><p> ?2¦hT¦-LINK SafeLoader¦(B¦ild time: Jun 12¦20¦5 - 09:49:53)<br />CPU: 560MHz AH¦: ¦25¦Hz DDR: 8MB<br />Perfor¦in¦ LED check..&nbsp; P¦SS¦<br />Press¦CT¦L+B to enter Saf¦Lo¦der: 1</p><p>some bits are faulty displayed. Repeating the boot up procedure some other signs are faulty. Interrupting the boot procedure with CTRL+B doesn&#039;t work.</p><p>Then I connected Ethernet additional to the serial to the CPE with tftp32 and the latest firmware image in the root directory. I renamed the image to recovery.bin. Upload from ethernet did work but no output to the serial port anymore. Strange! Whenever I disconnect the Ethernet connection the serial port works again. Same behaviour as without serial port connected. The unit gives response on one interface only. Ethernet or serial but not both.<br />May be its a problem of the image I try to flash. Could it be that I need a stripped image without bootloader? I don&#039;t know how big the bootloader of this router is.</p>									</div>

					<p>No, unfortnately not. No chance to solve the problem. Bootloader still works, asks in the first step for the &quot;recovery.bin&quot; and straight after thathat it asks for &quot;vmlinuz&quot;.</p><p>No stady connection via serial interface. Some signs are messing, no response to the interrupt during boot process.</p>									</div>
