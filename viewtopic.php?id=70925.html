When i try it gives me an error;</p><p>Error code: 18005<br />Upgrade unsuccessfully because the version of the upgraded file was incorrect. Please check the file name.</p><p>I tried; back to available older firmware versions, flash with OpenWRT and DD-WRT, LEDE project. But everytime i took same error. I think there is a block that apply by TP Link to do not use third party firmwares <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p><p>I also tried rename .bin files. </p><p>Here is the question; is there any way to flash a .bin file for this access point. I stay at that firmware version <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> Can anybody edit the original firmware .bin file content to make flashable it again?

					<p>Is there any firmware file to avoid this blocked TP-Link firmware? TFTP works on routers but this device is an access point. So is the only way serial connection to install another firmware on this device?</p>									</div>

If anybody hepls me i would be satisfied thanks <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />There is a few method; like header check, RSA or SHA sign control and region code on some parts of firmware file that TP-Link uses. Is there any idea about this?</p>									</div>
