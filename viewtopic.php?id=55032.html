					<p>Hi Guys,</p><p>I&#039;m posting this to ask for official support for the UAP-LR version. </p><p>When trying to get rid of the factory firmware I tried the one that most resembled. There is no official LR version so I tried the &quot;ubnt-unifi&quot; and this soft bricked the AP. Then I booted it in fail safe mode and tftp&#039;ed the outdoor version. Worked perfect. I also tried on another one to flash directly the outdoor version and it worked. </p><p>This one soft bricks the AP:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-unifi-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … actory.bin</a></p><p>This one works almost perfect*:<br /><a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-unifi-outdoor-squashfs-factory.bin">https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots … actory.bin</a></p><p>* Perfect: the leds need to be configured afterward, and I don&#039;t know what they mean by Long Range as the maximum this AP outputs is 22dbm.</p>									</div>
