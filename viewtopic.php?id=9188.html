					<p>Hmmmm, I was hoping somebody managed to upgrade his WL-500gx to 128MB :-/<br />Isn&#039;t the CFE detecting how much RAM the router has?<br />Did you try a serial console, to see what the CFE says?<br />And: where did you buy those chips and how much are those (or the MT48LC16M16A2P-75 for an upgrade to 64MB)?<br />Any chance to get those in Vienna?<br />Paying 100$/€++ just for a test seems quite much to me.<br />A WL-700gE is &lt;240€, has a real IDE hard disk built in with a faster and better Processor/architecture, and OpenWrt support for it has just startet :-)</p>									</div>

					<p>@CountZero<br />No, I don&#039;t have serial console (yet). I thought it is not necessary to have at this stage. What do you expect from the CFE during reboot? Will it lead us to the codes that need to be changed? If so, I will build that as soon as possible!</p><p>And yes, I did &quot;nvram commit&quot;. </p><p>@MMCM<br />Believe me. The chips I got were not cheap. But I think it worth the fun <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/lol.png" width="15" height="15" alt="lol" />. I got it from <a href="http://catalog.digikey.com/scripts/partsearch.dll?Detail?name=557-1078-1-ND"><strong><span class="bbu">here</span></strong></a>. You better make sure that the chips will be sent within EU. Otherwise you will pay all the costs to have it in Vienna, which is almost the same as the price of the chips themselve. As I did <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" />. When I got the proforma invoice from them, it says that the country of origin is Italy. So I decided to pay them. But actualy they sent them from the USA.</p><p>My main idea is to move all applications (if possible) from my IBM xSeries 330 to my WL500GD, especially the Asterisk PBX. So I need quite a lot of memory. To 512MB if I could, as that is the maximum memory BCM5365 processor can handle. A part from that, the IBM server consumes quite a lot of electricity as it is running 24/7. And it is also too noisy to have it at home, so I put it in the room which door always close. But now I want to use that room.</p>									</div>

					<p>It is the CFE that handles all initialization so I would begin with that. The serial port is already in place, just needs level translators to communicatewith the computer. The actual initialization is done in sbsdram.S residing in some directory related to CFE. I settle for 64MB for now so I have not dug deeper in to it...</p><p>I dont think more than 128MB is possible, the lines are not connected(I think). If you need more the NSLU seems to provide for 256MB: <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/FattenYourSlug">http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/FattenYourSlug</a></p>									</div>

					<p>In my novice opinion, we do not get detail initialisation process on the CFE. We just get a few more lines which especially do not tell us the detail about memory initialisation. And I think the only advantage to have the serial console is that we can have access to the CFE environment.</p><p>Anyway, I finally installed the serial console with the hope that I can enter some kind of CFE debug mode to get more information about memory initialisation.

					<p>well, it does indeed look like CFE defaults to sdram_init=0x2008 so it probably needs to be rebuilt. Not sure of how to change it though...&nbsp; &nbsp;However if I would start experimenting with the bootloader I would get a JTAG interface first... Another option is to remove the flash and program it out of the router, wich you obviously are capable of <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Anyway, getting the sources for CFE is the first thing to get started with, IIRC it is included in the ASUS GPL firmware + Broadcom has a much newer version available online(probably need some mods to suit the 500gd).</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your confirmation and support CountZero. Otherwise, to be honest, I almost gave up. As to what I understood up to now, the maximum supported memory is only 64MB. It looks like quite a lot of things need to be changed. Oh.. well, this is just a matter of time. I just need to read more.</p><p>Yes, I plan to continue with 64MB. I still need to mount the 60GB hard disk, properly mount the USB interface and serial ports, and also two tiny fans.

					<p>To be honest, not 100% sure. But since CFE detects 64MB, so I thought all the 13 row addresses should be fine. I had it also running for more than 2 hours without crashing when I tested the serial console. Does CFE not do memory test? I think it does.</p><p>At the moment, this router is without WAN connection. I&#039;ll configure something there. Maybe wireless client and ftp server then test it. Or do you know the best way to test the memory?</p>									</div>

					<p>I think it does test it, how thorough it tests is another question <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>I tested it by using ftp to transfer some files, keeping an eye on memory usage. Sofar from looking at CFE sources I have not seen anything suggesting that CFE is limited as to what memory parameters are passed to the controller.</p>									</div>
