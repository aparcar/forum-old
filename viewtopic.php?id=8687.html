					<p>I want to replace the DSL modem that was given by my ISP with a better quality one so I get fewer disconnects.&nbsp; Is there any DSL modems out there that people have Openwrt running.&nbsp; I could have QOS running on it into my asus WL-700ge. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Thanks,<br />LK.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, I could tell a story concerning this... <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /><br />A friend of mine asked me to build a small home network for him by using just a D-Link DSL360-T and a simple, 4 or 5-port switch... and I made it! Not too surprisingly, this modem runs Linux, so I could configure it to behave like a router! It wasn&#039;t too hard, though, I just had to update the firmware to a &quot;special&quot; version (in fact, it was an untouched D-Link firmware from the german d-link site). It&#039;s a bit funny: the firmware, the modem came with, was a simplified version, which contained just the most important functions, so it didn&#039;t have a dhcp daemon, a firewall, pppoe client, nothing! Just the very needed packages to work as an NT.<br />As I installed the &quot;smart&quot; firmware, a lot of new features and settings appeared on the web interface! It took me about 20-25 minutes to set up the dlink as a fully-functional NAT router, firewall and, of course, a DHCP server!<br />I&#039;m not sure about QoS support on this model, but I think, that&#039;s more than enough for a modem.</p><p>Greetings from the Heart of Europe! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>geryhun</strong> on 20 Dec 2006, 20:29)</p>

					<p>Any TI-AR7 device should do the trick.&nbsp; See <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/AR7Port">http://wiki.openwrt.org/AR7Port</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/CategoryAR7Device">http://wiki.openwrt.org/CategoryAR7Device</a>.</p><p>If you just want it to act as a modem and not a router, setting it up to act like a bridge should be pretty easy.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>exobyte</strong> on 20 Dec 2006, 21:30)</p>
