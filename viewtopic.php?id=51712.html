					<p>Hello,</p><p>may anyone know&#039;s how to switch on the keyboard on CLI using Tera Term to stop the autoboot on this router and get the ZyU console?</p><p>Other problem that i have, is the bootbase or Z-loader.<br />After some update(that start automatically from self)the router become slow so i downgraded it successfull back to v3.10 but the bootbase was still the new v3.05 and some option was lost.<br />By mistake i tried to upgrade the router with a firmware v3.11(BLT<strong>0</strong>) previously was v3.11(BLT<strong>1</strong>)and since this it&#039;s failed to load the firmware.</p><p>The problem is that the Bootbase v3.05 incl FW 3.11 is built-in a Zyxel ExpressTool as .EXE and can&#039;t get each file separately.<br />May someone know how get it from the ExpressTool this will also solve my problem.</p><p>I think if i can change back(upload over CLI) the FW v3.10 the router will be start again.</p><p>Anyone know&#039;s maybe what is the &quot;amazon_s Switch&quot;?<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>ROM VER: 1.1.3

					<p>Hello roadstar234,</p><p>I&#039;ve got the same problem and wish to upgrade my P-2612HNU-F1 from V3.10 (BLT.1) to V3.11 (BLT.1) with the hope to fix one instability problems. The Zyxel provided upgrade tool exe file regularly failed and I found no way to extract the bin file. Don&#039;t you mind share with me the v3.11BLT1 FW .bin file you have received from Zyxel?
