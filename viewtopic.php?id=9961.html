					<p>Hello!</p><p>I&#039;m looking for a simple config that will let my Meraki running Kamikaze OpenWrt act as a bridge. I want the wifi side to be a client (managed mode) to an AP and just bridge all traffic between the ethernet and wireless interface. When I follow the instructions on the wiki ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/KamikazeConfiguration">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Kam â€¦ figuration</a> ) the box seems to look up and I can&#039;t access it at all anymore. I need to reinstall OpenWrt to get it back to work.</p><p>When I configure the bridge manually (ssh login; brctl addbr br0; brctl addif br0 eth0; brctl addif br0 wifi0 ) the bridge comes up and I can ping it from the lan side and ping the lan connected host from the shell. But I can not ping any hosts on the wireless side of the network nor does the Meraki return any pings from other wireless devices...</p><p>Any ideas ?</p><p>Thanks a lot,</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />I have the same problem. Bridge seems to be configured ok, but its not possible to ping something behind wifi. I have bridge between ath0 (wifi) in client mode connected to AP and eth1 where is connected PC. I can make connection to the router through eth1 port from PC, but I cannot access network behind ath0 (from router neither from pc).<br />I can post my config..</p><p>Rufus</p>									</div>
