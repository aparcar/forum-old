					<p>Hello,</p><p>I am using Kamikaze 7.09 on WL-500 Gp router. I have build my image from sources without problems. What I am trying to do now is to compile a driver for an USB IR transceiver. As this driver binary is available for x86 systems only, I am trying to compile it from source. I read the SDK howto and several other articles about the toolchain, makefile creation etc., but did not succeed to compile the driver myself.</p><p>Here is the location of the source of the driver I need: <a href="http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mod-mce/mod_mce-0.1.4.tar.bz2">http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourc â€¦ .4.tar.bz2</a></p><p>The source is a signle C file. I even tryed to compile it without a Makefile with direct invocation of the MIPS compiler, but it threw a lot of errors about unresolved symbols etc.</p><p>I will be very grateful if someone can help me with this.</p><br /><p>zdravko</p>									</div>
