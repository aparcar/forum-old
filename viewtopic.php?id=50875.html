					<p>Hi <strong>qasdfdsaq</strong>,</p><p>1. Yes, you are right - I implied that it is a bug, but I agree that it is not a bug.&nbsp; </p><p>What really should happen is a WARNING in the log file that using localhost as a socks-proxy may mean that the SSH gateway is no longer reachable when the route table is updated during tunnel negotiation. See also point 4, below.</p><p>2. No, you are wrong - the option is not experimental.</p><p>I don&#039;t know whay, but the link you gave me for the OpenVPN manual (<a href="https://openvpn.net/man.html">https://openvpn.net/man.html</a>) redirects to the v2.0.x manual!&nbsp; If you look at the 2.3 manual (<a href="https://openvpn.net/man.html">https://openvpn.net/man.html</a>), the option is no longer experimental.</p><p>3. Yes, you are right - I got SOCKS proxy and SSH gateway &#039;confused&#039;.</p><p>I was writing SSH gateway, but in my mind I mostly meant the SOCKS proxy/SSH client!&nbsp; Later, I will therefore update my previous post(s) to avoid confusing people.</p><p>4. BTW, OpenVPN know exactly what <strong>remote_host</strong> is (it&#039;s used with <strong>--route</strong>.&nbsp; In the case of <strong>--remote</strong> (but no SOCKS proxy), it&#039;s $REMOTE_SERVER_ADDR, but with <strong>--socks-proxy</strong>, (I understand) it&#039;s the $SOCKS_PROXY_ADDR (this doesn&#039;t appear to be documented, which led to my thinking it&#039;s a &#039;bug&#039;). </p><p>-----</p><p>In all, 2-1 your way!

					<p>1) I&#039;m glad we agree. It&#039;s true that this behaviour may confuse people. But it&#039;s not really OpenVPN&#039;s fault.</p><p>2) Well their website linking to the wrong manual <em>is</em> OpenVPN&#039;s fault :-P</p><p>4) Well, yes it knows the address of the VPN endpoint, but still wouldn&#039;t know about the endpoint of your SSH gateway. Which might in this case <em>be</em> the remote server but could also be anything else - all OpenVPN knows is there is a SOCKS server at 127.0.0.1, it&#039;s up to the SOCKS server how it routes things, whether it be via SSH or anything else. It&#039;s just a bad interaction if that server is on the same machine. There&#039;s no &quot;rule&quot; to say the SOCKS proxy connects to the destination server at all - lots of services (e.g. Tor) present a SOCKS proxy on localhost and tunnel it to completely different addresses.</p>									</div>
