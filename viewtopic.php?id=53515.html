					<p>Hi.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to build a prototype EtherCAT device.&nbsp; We are investigating utilizing EtherCAT in our production environment.&nbsp; After having no luck finding development boards (the only ones I can find utilize a custom ASIC), it occurred to me that I could use one of our RB433 MikroTik boards.&nbsp; The requirement is to be able to send/receive custom 802.3 frames at 100-base-t.&nbsp; Also, we need two network interfaces, and incoming and an outgoing port.</p><p>Since OpenWrt can build custom images with the Atheros Chip and supports the RB433, I was hoping to use this as the software platform.</p><p>But, for the life of me, I can&#039;t find where the tcp stack is in the source, or how it is integrated with the Atheros chip.</p><p>I can get example source for implementing EtherCAT in a standard Linux build and you can use PCAP on a Windows build to talk EtherCAT (I&#039;ve tried it and it works).</p><p>The ultimate goal is to build a working prototype using an input EtherCAT port, an output EtherCAT port and using the third port as a standard TCP/IP port for diagnostics, configuring, etc.</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p><p>--Ken</p>									</div>
