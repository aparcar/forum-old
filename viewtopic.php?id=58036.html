					<p>Hi All,</p><p>Firstly - Very noob at compiling OpenWRT from scratch, so sorry if I&#039;ve missed something obvious :-)</p><p>Trying to compile new image for an ath77xx board.&nbsp; Base config is working ok, I have a kernel / squashfs image which boots.</p><p>However I&#039;m having problems trying to add extra files to the image, for example /www to match busyboxes httpd.</p><p>Working from the git trunk, my base directory is ~/openwrt which has .config, .git etc etc in it.</p><p>From the wiki ( <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build</a> ) it says I should be able to create a files directory in my build root which is overlaid. I presume in my case ~/openwrt/files/www/ for the web directory.</p><p>Unfortunately the make process completes cleanly but ignores my files directory.</p><br /><p>Do I need to add the directory somewhere in the makeconfig?</p><br /><p>Cheers</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>

					<p>... and to answer my own post .... Turns out this was simply a local file permissions problem on the machine I was doing the make on!</p><p>Mark</p>									</div>
