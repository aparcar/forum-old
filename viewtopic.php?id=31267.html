					<p>Hello everyone,<br />First up I have to say how awesome OpenWrt is.<br />A short while ago I purchased a Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH but found the stock firmware (a cut back version of DD-WRT) too limiting. After trying for ages to get the full blown version of DD-WRT to work I thought I would give OpenWrt a bash and haven&#039;t looked back since! <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/big_smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="big_smile" /></p><p>First some background:</p><p>At work our photographers spend quite a bit of time wrestling with windows xp computers to get the card readers to work (most often I arrive to find windows has assigned a drive letter to the card reader that is already in use by a network share) and then have to copy, sort and rename the photos before they can work on them.<br />It occured to me that most of this task could be automated with a dedicated card reader attached to an off the shelf router with usb (a WZR-HP-G300NH or perhaps something simpler as wireless is not needed)</p><p>- Plug the CF or SD card into the reader<br />- Photos on the card are processed by exiftool<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- renamed according to exif data and moved to a sub folder of a windows share<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;named by the value of &quot;copyright&quot; in the exif data (the photographers name)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;eg: exiftool &quot;-directory&lt;copyright&quot; &quot;-filename&lt;createdate&quot; -d &quot;%Y%m%d_%H&amp;M%S%%-c.%%e&quot; &quot;smbdestination&quot;</p><br /><p>Now to my question:</p><p>Is this possible with OpenWrt?<br />I imagine it could be triggered to start upon attachment of a new usb device or insertion of SD or CompactFlash card into the reader and hijack the lights on the front of the unit to indicate progress/completion</p><p>Has anyone done anything similar or have any guidance on where to start?</p>									</div>
