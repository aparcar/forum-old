					<p>Hi, </p><p>I just bought a TP-Link TL-WR2543ND (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr2543nd</a>) and immediately installed OpenWRT.<br />First time I use Open-WRT, I&#039;m totally impressed!! :-)</p><br /><p>Anyway, this model has 8MB of ROM and 32MB of RAM.</p><p>I wanted to expand the storage with a USB stick, so I&#039;m playing with an 8GB USB stick I had laying around doing nothing...</p><p>I want to create 3 partition:<br />1) extroot (for openWRT packages)<br />2) SWAP<br />3) Storage</p><p>I&#039;m not particularly interested in how big &quot;storage&quot; is going to be, whatever is left after having created the other two is fine...</p><p>The question is, how big the extroot and swap partitions should be?</p><p>These are my guesses.</p><p>SWAP partition:<br />Normally I don&#039;t expect a Linux system to swap much, also because otherwise it would get extremely slow.<br />Even more in this case since it&#039;s using a USB stick.<br />So, having 32MB of RAM, I would say the SWAP should be something like 64/128MB?</p><p>EXTROOT partition.<br />My rootfs is 5.1MB with 3MB being free.<br />Now, I don&#039;t know how many more packages I&#039;m going to install and nor how big openWRT packages can be but I want to keep the system as flexible as possible.<br />So, how big should this partition be?<br />1GB/2GB?</p><p>Any idea/suggestion is much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />Andrea</p>									</div>
