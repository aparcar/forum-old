					<p>Not webcam... If you haven&#039;t tried OpenWRT, you should start off with WhiteRussian RC6:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing#head-1a60a7c16a58cbcb8ba1434325f4f24567b0b965">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins â€¦ 4567b0b965</a><br />Here is a good starting guide for what you can install:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Packages">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Packages</a><br />URL Filter and Samba should go OK, the same with USB. But I haven&#039;t heard of any webcam-solution. Not that I should know anyway.</p><p>Remember to install the package &quot;nas&quot; if you want WPA to work...</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>h017ah</strong> on 12 Dec 2006, 16:21)</p>

					<p>I got a webcam working with the Philips pwc/pwcx driver and an Asus WL500g: see forum thread <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3682">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=3682</a></p><p>But performance was miserable. Do yourself a favour and buy a cheap ethernet-attached webcam instead. (The Edimax is very cheap - although I&#039;ve not tried it - or Panasonic have some low-end ones too)</p><p>Then you can point it at something like zoneminder running on a PC, and the low-speed MIPS CPU in the Asus only has to forward the IP packets back and forth <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>
