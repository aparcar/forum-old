					<p>When I tried to compile OpenWRT SVN trunk to use for my USR5461, I ended up with a firmware as small as 3.8MB and that won&#039;t fit on a USR5461 2MB FLASH. I am hoping someone here has the OpenWRT SVN trunk .config file for USR5461, preferably with a USB mass storage kernel module, and can e-mail it to me to usr5461.config@slickdeals.endjunk.com. This way, I can attach a USB mass storage to its USB port to run other applications.</p>									</div>
