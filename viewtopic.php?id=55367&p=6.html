					<p>Recently I discovered my Netgear R6250 has not port 5 connected to eth0 but also port 7 connected to eth1. So there is a chance R6250 uses the same hardware setup and there is port 8 connected to eth2. I was playing with it for a bit, unfortunately I wasn&#039;t able to get it working. Not sure if it was because port 8 being not connected, or if I indeed hit the same issue you do with R8000.</p><p>I&#039;ll do few more tests, most likely over the weekend. I&#039;ll also try my other bcm53xx device that also may be ports 7 and 8 connected.</p>									</div>

All I can say to anyone is, in my recent experience, be VERY careful. Radios are quite Wonky. I have gone back to the March 7 - KONG build for my R8000. It is the main gateway and It runs very well(all 3 radios). One of my ap&#039;s is an R7000 running mainline DD-WRT, it&#039;s two radios are running the same ssid&#039;s as the 2.4ghz radio and one of the 5ghz radios on the R8000, and they work together very well. </p><p>That being said, I would jump all over an Openwrt Image !</p>									</div>

					<p>For anyone brave enough to update the firmware with a homebuild version. Here is a little howto. On Jul 30 I did this exercise myself to build the R8000 OpenWrt firmware from scratch. As usual this is all at your own risk. If you brick your device then that is your own problem.</p><p>==============================================<br />Preparing your system for Build:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a></p><p>sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip</p><p>==============================================</p><p>Get OpenWRT sources and configure:</p><p><strong>git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git</strong><br />{ This created a directory openwrt }</p><p><strong>cd openwrt</strong><br /><strong>./scripts/feeds update -a</strong><br /><strong>./scripts/feeds install -a</strong></p><p><strong>make defconfig</strong><br /><strong>make prereq</strong><br /><strong>make menuconfig</strong><br />{<br />--&gt; Target System, select Select Broadcom BCM47xx/53xx (ARM)<br />--&gt; Kernel Modules --&gt; Wireless Drivers --&gt; kmod-b43 (deselect)<br />--&gt; Kernel Modules --&gt; Wireless Drivers --&gt; kmod-brcmutil --&gt; Broadcom wireless driver debugging (select)<br />--&gt; LuCI --&gt; Collections --&gt; luci (select *)<br />}<br />- Now edit one file:<br />target/linux/bcm53xx/base-files/etc/board.d/02_network --&gt; Remove the following 3 lines:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>netgear,r8000)
    ifname=eth2
    ;;</code></pre></div><p>And remove the following 4 lines:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>elif echo &quot;$vlan1ports&quot; | egrep -q &quot;^0 1 2 3 5 7 8&quot; &amp;&amp; \
     echo &quot;$vlan2ports&quot; | egrep -q &quot;^4 8&quot;; then
    ucidef_add_switch_vlan &quot;switch0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0 1 2 3 5 7 8t&quot;
    ucidef_add_switch_vlan &quot;switch0&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;4 8t&quot;</code></pre></div><p><strong>make</strong></p><p>dont use -j the first time and wait, this will take a long time as all packages are pulled in. When this is finished there should be a file called: bin/bcm53xx/openwrt-bcm53xx-netgear-r8000-squashfs.chk, but we are not done yet !!. <br />After the first make the b53 switch code has to be updated. The reason is that the patches applied by openwrt are not finalized yet. Reverting the patch (in combination with the change done to the 02_network file, done earlier) will make the switch work, though it might use an incorrect mac address and the wan port might not work (haven&#039;t tried it). NOTE: if you don&#039;t do this step then ethernet/switch wont work and the device will not be usable and can only be updated through CFE. <br />Restore original switch code, as new one is not ready yet, this cp command will revert the patch which has been applied to the b53 driver, which is not working for the moment, this cp command is based of the Jul 30 checkout. Directories will change over time, make sure the command was successful: </p><p><strong>cp target/linux/generic/files/drivers/net/phy/b53/b53_common.c build_dir/target-arm_cortex-a9_musl-1.1.10_eabi/linux-bcm53xx/linux-3.18.19/drivers/net/phy/b53/b53_common.c</strong></p><p>{ Final build, to take reverted switch code in: }<br /><strong>make</strong> { shouldn&#039;t take that long anymore, but you can use -j to speed it up }</p><p>==============================================</p><p>Flashing the image:</p><p>Upload the file bin/bcm53xx/openwrt-bcm53xx-netgear-r8000-squashfs.chk. This can be done through the WEB-GUI of the original firmware. </p><p>Note: the default ip address of the router will be 192.168.1.1. Try browsing to this address and configure the router.<br />Note: Sometimes one of the wifi devices can get in a bad state (during configuration). When this happens the router can end up in endless reboot loop. In that case you&#039;ll have to power down the R8000 and power it up again.

On Jul 30 I did this exercise myself to build the R8000 OpenWrt firmware from scratch. As usual this is all at your own risk. If you brick your device then that is your own problem.</p><p>==============================================<br />Preparing your system for Build:</p><p><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence</a></p><p>sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion git-core libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip</p><p>==============================================</p><p>Get OpenWRT sources and configure:</p><p><strong>git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git</strong><br />{ This created a directory openwrt }</p><p><strong>cd openwrt</strong><br /><strong>./scripts/feeds update -a</strong><br /><strong>./scripts/feeds install -a</strong></p><p><strong>make defconfig</strong><br /><strong>make prereq</strong><br /><strong>make menuconfig</strong><br />{<br />--&gt; Target System, select Select Broadcom BCM47xx/53xx (ARM)<br />--&gt; Kernel Modules --&gt; Wireless Drivers --&gt; kmod-b43 (deselect)<br />--&gt; Kernel Modules --&gt; Wireless Drivers --&gt; kmod-brcmutil --&gt; Broadcom wireless driver debugging (select)<br />--&gt; LuCI --&gt; Collections --&gt; luci (select *)<br />}<br />- Now edit one file:<br />target/linux/bcm53xx/base-files/etc/board.d/02_network --&gt; Remove the following 3 lines:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>netgear,r8000)

When this is finished there should be a file called: bin/bcm53xx/openwrt-bcm53xx-netgear-r8000-squashfs.chk, but we are not done yet !!. <br />After the first make the b53 switch code has to be updated. The reason is that the patches applied by openwrt are not finalized yet. Reverting the patch (in combination with the change done to the 02_network file, done earlier) will make the switch work, though it might use an incorrect mac address and the wan port might not work (haven&#039;t tried it). NOTE: if you don&#039;t do this step then ethernet/switch wont work and the device will not be usable and can only be updated through CFE. <br />Restore original switch code, as new one is not ready yet, this cp command will revert the patch which has been applied to the b53 driver, which is not working for the moment, this cp command is based of the Jul 30 checkout. Directories will change over time, make sure the command was successful: </p><p><strong>cp target/linux/generic/files/drivers/net/phy/b53/b53_common.c build_dir/target-arm_cortex-a9_musl-1.1.10_eabi/linux-bcm53xx/linux-3.18.19/drivers/net/phy/b53/b53_common.c</strong></p><p>{ Final build, to take reverted switch code in: }<br /><strong>make</strong> { shouldn&#039;t take that long anymore, but you can use -j to speed it up }</p><p>==============================================</p><p>Flashing the image:</p><p>Upload the file bin/bcm53xx/openwrt-bcm53xx-netgear-r8000-squashfs.chk. This can be done through the WEB-GUI of the original firmware. </p><p>Note: the default ip address of the router will be 192.168.1.1. Try browsing to this address and configure the router.<br />Note: Sometimes one of the wifi devices can get in a bad state (during configuration).
