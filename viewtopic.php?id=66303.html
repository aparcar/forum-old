					<p>I have Google Fiber. I&#039;m trying to connect my router directly to the ONT, rather than using the stock network box (it&#039;s really loud). Unfortunately, while they&#039;ve made this very straightforward for business subscribers, it&#039;s not at all easy to do on home networks.</p><p>I have never installed 3rd party router firmware before, and I have an Archer C7, so it was tricky, but I&#039;ve finally got the latest openwrt firmware on it.</p><p>I don&#039;t see how to configure what I need in the GUI, so I guess I&#039;ll need to edit some config files via SSH. Problem is, I don&#039;t fully understand what&#039;s required. I&#039;ve googled, and read a few posts on how people did what I want to do, but the guides are very specific to their hardware/software. I&#039;ve heard it can be done with OpenWrt, but I don&#039;t know how to generalize their information enough to do it.</p><p>Can I get some help?

It&#039;s only my wife and I, so we&#039;d struggle to use more than that anyway.<br />Also, the Fiber network box antenna caps wifi speeds at 100mbps anyway - it&#039;s awful. Fiber speeds are great, but only if it&#039;s wired. They saddle you with terrible hardware, and basically try to force you to use it.</p><p>I could always double NAT and use my router, but I&#039;m pretty sure that kind of setup is unsafe if I want to set up my own VPN. Plus that doesn&#039;t solve the noise issue.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>morgvanny</strong> on 18 Jul 2016, 18:45)</p>

And it&#039;s not even an AC router. What a piece of junk.<br />I have a friend who figured out how to take it out of the chain, but I&#039;m pretty sure he has DD-WRT. That has pretty limited compatibility with the Archer C7 - the 5GHz band doesn&#039;t work. I figure there has to be a way to do it with this, but I don&#039;t know how to generalize the info from those posts I linked to.</p>									</div>
