					<p>I&#039;ve just started with OpenWrt developing.<br />First of all thank to all who are working on the project!<br />When I run make menuconfig it was great! Nice interfac and intuitive menu.</p><p>I tried to find the information in the forum and in the Wiki. But I still have 3 questions:</p><p>- How can set the configuration in the way that the make build the Openwrt released image (the ones I could find here: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/bin/)">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/rc5/bin/)</a> ? Is it &quot;make defconfig&quot; the right command? <br />- How can I reduce the HD space required? Is there a command to eliminate the file of the toolchain I don&#039;t need anymore? (.o and eventually the sources) ?<br />- I have a WRT54GS I am not interested to the other bin. Could I build only its image?</p><p>Thank you very much in advance,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cris</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Cris</strong> on 15 May 2006, 15:52)</p>

					<p>You can build the images for your device by editing the target/linux/image/brcm/Makefile, and removing the lines that do not contain wrt54gs.</p>									</div>
