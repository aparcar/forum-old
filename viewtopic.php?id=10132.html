					<p>Hello</p><p>Dont know if anyone else is having problems with ALSA and in particular alsamixer.</p><p>Having reviewed the source of the alsa package, I have found a problem: when alsamixer runs, it looks for a &quot;control&quot; device in /dev/snd - for a single sound card this would normally be /dev/snd/controlC0</p><p>(for those interested it seems to be hardcoded in build_mipsel/alsa-lib-1.0.13/include/config.h : <br />line 8: #define ALSA_DEVICE_DIRECTORY &quot;/dev/snd&quot;<br />this is a .configure generated file so maybe getting the default from my build system? i dont know quite how it works)</p><p>Openwrt currently creates that device as /dev/controlC0</p><p>so alsamixer cannot find the mixer device.</p><p>I created a symlink :</p><p>mkdir /dev/snd<br />ln -s /dev/controlC0 /dev/snd/controlC0</p><p>and now alsamixer runs, I can control volume and capture characteristics.</p><p>There are probably other problems (e.g. i expect alsa will expect /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c and p also for actual playback using Alsa) here and surely there is a better solution (OpenWRT developers - can we create alsa devices in /dev/snd by default???)</p><p>Thanks</p><p>John</p>									</div>
