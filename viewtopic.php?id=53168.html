					<p>Hello,<br />Just so you know, I am a complete newbie at running my own server.<br />An SSL-encrypted instance of Owncloud is supposed to go live from my home mini-pc, but I can&#039;t seem to make it deliver to the outside world as long as it&#039;s behind the Openwrt router. I installed Barrier Breaker 14.07-rc3 / LuCI Trunk (svn-r10467) on a TP-Link TL-WR841N/ND and put it between my ISP&#039;s gateway/modem and the server.<br />The reason for this is that the ISP-modem comes with its own customized firmware and very limited configuration options. Thus, it won&#039;t let me do this: <a href="http://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=23767">http://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ mp;t=23767</a> (in short: resolve the DNS to the server&#039;s local IP in order for mobile devices to sync over the local network and not the internet while they&#039;re at home).<br />That&#039;s why I want&nbsp; the server to be behind Openwrt, but obviously I&#039;m doing it wrong: <br />I get all kinds of error messages in the browser, from &quot;cannot make connection&quot; to &quot;corrupted content&quot; to &quot;untrusted connection&quot; (which is because of my self-signed certificate, but the option to ignore the warning and add an exection is greyed out/not working) when visiting the URL. Here&#039;s what the setup looks like (I may have gotten the icons wrong, just take them for what I labelled them):</p><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LIlDeTB.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/LIlDeTB.png" /></span></p><br /><p><em>However</em>, If I put the server directly behind the Gateway, everything works fine:</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rtavc9J.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/rtavc9J.png" /></span></p><br /><p>These are the port forwards I have active in Openwrt, where 192.168.1.145 is the server&#039;s IP:</p><br /><p><span class="postimg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GSZ2kks.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/GSZ2kks.png" /></span></p><br /><p>Can anyone give me a hint how I can make this work, and possibly then how I might achieve the spoof-IP@home-thingy?<br />Thanks a bunch, Ben</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bennypr0fane</strong> on 7 Oct 2014, 01:24)</p>

					<p>Maybe you misunderstood the last post.&nbsp; Have you placed the openwrt router in the dmz, on your ISP&#039;s router?</p>									</div>
