					<p>So I installed Barrier Breaker on a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND v2.1.. I installed the trunk from about a week or 2 ago..&nbsp; </p><p>So I get it all set up, install Luci, etc.. and set up a wifi network and leave it at the home of the person I was helping.&nbsp; First time I&#039;ve used OpenWrt and there was a learning curve but I got it to do what I want and it&#039;s really slick.</p><p>A week or two later and they say things aren&#039;t working anymore.&nbsp; I go there.&nbsp; I look for wireless networks with my iPhone.&nbsp; Nothing found!&nbsp; So I figure I will log into Luci with their PC and see what is up.&nbsp; There is no response as if there is no webserver operating.&nbsp; So I try to ping the router.&nbsp; Pings fine.&nbsp; I try to ssh.&nbsp; I get a login prompt.&nbsp; I try &quot;root&quot; and the password that I had set.&nbsp; Invalid password.&nbsp; And I know I didn&#039;t forget it because I wrote it down.&nbsp; I did power-cycle several times.&nbsp; Same result.</p><p>So... I have to hold the reset button in and reset the configuration. Then telnet in, set password, ssh in, setup wan, install luci, etc, etc...&nbsp; I get it all set up again and it now seems to be working fine.</p><p>Has anyone else seen this kind of configuration loss?&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s just a bug or if someone hacked in or if a virus on the LAN got to it (there was a computer that seems to have a virus as it keeps setting the browser homepage to safesearch.ch and it is seemingly impossible to remove).</p><p>Any suggestiong appreciated!</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;ve had this same problem now with 2 identical pairs of tl-wr1043ND v2.1 configured identically with a slightly different release (I think) of barrier breaker.</p><p>After 2 or 3 weeks the WDS AP router loses its mind, it changes the ssh password, re-enables telnet and drops the wireless network.&nbsp; Luci is also no longer available.&nbsp; I think the station router is ok but I&#039;m not 100% sure of this.</p><p>So I give up on openwrt for now I think.. I found that the other popular firmware (that rhymes with EE) has a beta version for this router that seems to let me do WDS AP/Station as well and it is working OK.&nbsp; So we&#039;ll see how stable it is...</p>									</div>

					<p>first you should format C and reinstall windows on your pc, and then change all your passwords, <br />i really doubt openwrt would change the root password by itself... </p><p>after installing luci on the trunks, you need to make sure the webserver starts up automatically, <br />aka &quot;/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable&quot;, if you don&#039;t do that and reboot the router, luci will not be working...</p>									</div>

					<p>The routers were configured on a totally separate network.&nbsp; The target network in question had a single PC on it, that was wiped and reloaded and the configuration loss still occurred.&nbsp; I was careful to disable telnet and enable dropbear only on the lan so I really don&#039;t think it was hacked into.&nbsp; I think there is a serious bug with openwrt and this router model.</p><p>Also I did have luci set to autostart.</p>									</div>

					<p>I can confirm this issue on the TP-LINK TL-WDR3600. This happened to me last night. I&#039;ve had OpenWRT installed on this model for months and months now with the works. Print server, DLNA, DNSMasq Etc. on ExtRoot. Everything stopped working LAN, WAN &amp; WIFI. All the extroot data was still intact, and no problems with the usb drive.</p><p>I has to telnet in, and reset root pw, but no opkg installs or configs would stick. I had to mtd -r erase rootfs_data. After I wiped everything and reinstalled configs (I had backed up), all has worked fine.</p>									</div>
