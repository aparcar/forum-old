					<p>Is anyone currently looking at OpenWRT on a DG834G? I got one of these this week and have got a serial port hooked up in preparation for looking at OpenWRT on it, but I don&#039;t want to go reinventing the wheel if there&#039;s already work being done. I saw something about checksum problems after first boot with the AR7 port? Is that the last known status?</p>									</div>

					<p>FWIW, I ended up patching ADAM2. More details at <a href="http://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/dg834g-openwrt.html">http://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/dg834g-openwrt.html</a> but I don&#039;t advise doing it yourself unless you&#039;re sure of what you&#039;re doing. I&#039;ve now got a recent SVN checkout of the AR7 port running on my DG834G. No wireless yet though. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>noodles</strong> on 5 Dec 2005, 18:27)</p>
