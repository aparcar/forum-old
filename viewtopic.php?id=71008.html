					<p>I hope there is still life in this thread. </p><p>I update my Tripmate HT-TM06 with OpenWRT..<br />Did NOTsee what it looks like since there were no screen shots of menus or layout posted anywhere on here.</p><p>So OpenWRT looks cool, but it&#039;s EXTREMELY complicated to set up a USB NAS, seems a sacrifice to many standard features that the device was made for when using their original interface. Is it possible to run original software from Hootoo as before with OpenWRT at same time?</p><p>If not, how to flash it back back to factory?<br />Using WopenWRT as a NAS is to entailed and complicated for traveling, not sure if I would have reconfigure it for each different USB device I plugged in or if it sticks with USB port.</p><p>UPDATE:<br />@#^##$!@#$!%!@#^ -&nbsp; I just came across this information from a different model TM05, TM06 did not explain this.<br />Has this changed with new model? Revert firmware to Hootoo ?<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />WIP OpenWrt Install</p><p>Warning!<br />This section describes actions that might damage your device or firmware. Proceed with care!</p><p>From this forum post about the HT-TM06; works on the HT-TM05 as well.</p><p>WARNING: We haven&#039;t found a way to revert back to HooToo&#039;s stock firmware yet! If you follow this process, it&#039;s permanent! In order to revert back, you will have to send it in for service. Although HooToo Support has been very gracious with a few people about this, this will void your warranty and HooToo will have no responsibility to replace it.<br />__________________________________________________________________________________</p>									</div>
