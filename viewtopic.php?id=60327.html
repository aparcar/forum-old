					<p>Hello raymond12,</p><p>A simpler solution as @mschneider1 would be setting up a firewall rule allowing http/https connections to uhttpd from wan <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /><br />This can be done <strong> much </strong> faster than setting up openvpn.<br />/etc/config/firewall<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
config rule
    option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option src &#039;wan&#039;
    option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
    option family &#039;ipv4&#039;
    option name &#039;uhttpd-https WAN&#039;
    option dest_port &#039;1443&#039;
...</code></pre></div><p>Or without ssl:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
config rule
    option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option src &#039;wan&#039;
    option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
    option family &#039;ipv4&#039;
    option name &#039;uhttpd-http WAN&#039;
    option dest_port &#039;80&#039;
...</code></pre></div><p>Setting up a firewall rule in LuCI is straight forward, but i prefer the ssh + vi/nano method. </p><p>uhttpd listens on all ips by default, so there is no need to configure is. But just in case:<br />/etc/config/uhttpd<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
# HTTP listen addresses, multiple allowed

    # HTTPS listen addresses, multiple allowed
    list listen_https 0.0.0.0:443
    list listen_https [::]:443
...</code></pre></div><p>If you don&#039;t have the ssl packages installed by now, head over to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials">LuCI</a>.</p><p><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> You can also set up a dynamic dns <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ddns.client">client</a> for simpler connection, but since it is your brother, he can also use <a href="https://wtfismyip.com/">this site</a> to determine his ip and you connect to it directly, e.g. <a href="https://123.123.123.124:443/cgi-bin/luci">https://123.123.123.124:443/cgi-bin/luci</a> .</p><p>Napsi-GER-</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello RangerZ,</p><p>indeed, for the http solution there is no security aspect. When using https, the connection is encrypted via ssl.</p><p>But if you like to connect through ssh (which is encrypted), let ssh pass through the firewall on WAN interface for dropbear (initial configuration is to listen on all interfaces). For that you only need to modify the above firewall rule to:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>...
config rule
    option target &#039;ACCEPT&#039;
    option src &#039;wan&#039;
    option proto &#039;tcp&#039;
    option family &#039;ipv4&#039;
    option name &#039;dropbear ssh WAN&#039;
    option dest_port &#039;22&#039; #or whatever port dropbear is listening
...</code></pre></div><p>When the connection over ssh is working you may consider looking <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding">here</a>. It describes how you can then connect through ssh to e.g. an webserver on the same device (e.g. LuCI).</p><p>Napsi-GER-</p>									</div>

					<p>The solution give by Napsi-GER- would be simpler but MUCH MUCH less secure.&nbsp; Opening up the router as suggested means anybody on the web (including yourself) could get to the router&#039;s management page.&nbsp; If someone guesses/hacks the password they have access to the router, which is in essence a full blown unix box, which they could do all sorts of nasty things with.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would suggest against just opening the router to whole net.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hello mschneider1,</p><p>I do not want to start a discussion on security, but with ssh and authentication keys (password disabled), it <strong>should</strong> be safe.<br />At least i&#039;m feeling save and am using it so. And https is used broadly, so yes, this <strong>should</strong> be safe either.<br /><strong>BUT</strong> passwords... Yeah, you need at least a very good one if you open up your router to the internet!</p><p>Anyway back to topic, if you need access <strong> directly to the router </strong> there are a few options left:<br />- killing al lot of ram, cpu and flash by installing a full fledged vpn server (which is without certificate authentication equally &quot;less&quot; secure than https or ssh without authentication keys)<br />- using fast built in options e.g. firewall uhttpd and/or dropbear and <strong> optionally turning them of, when not needed</strong></p><p>access<strong> indirectly to the router</strong>:<br />- using a dedicated VPN server which is connected to the Router (same security as with vpn server on router itself, but much more performance EDIT: depending on hardware used)<br />- using a normal desktop PC with remote control e.g. TeamViewer or VNC</p><p>Every method has its pro and contra points. For some occasionally configurations i would opt to the second: using fast built in features and turning them of, when not needed.</p><p>If done right (passwords, firewall, certificates/keys) it <strong>should</strong> provide quite a good level of security.</p><p>Correct me if i&#039;m wrong somewhere, but that&#039;s my knowledge so far.</p><p>@mschneider1 I would like it if you can provide any other solution, i am still willing to learn something new <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Napsi-GER-</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Napsi-GER-</strong> on 15 Oct 2015, 21:40)</p>

					<p>He also suggested tunneling the HTTP(S) connection through SSH, which I think is a sound suggestion. I would strongly recommend only accepting public key SSH authentication from WAN though, see <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/dropbear#multiple_dropbear_instances">doc/uci/dropbear#multiple_dropbear_instances</a> for an example.</p><p>Do you need to make changes on the router regularly, or just once? For any kind of remote access basic Internet must obviously be up, and at that point you might as well connect to his PC via e.g. Teamviewer and browse LuCI locally. If you&#039;re doing changes regularly, remote access (preferably SSH or some VPN) is easier to work with.</p>									</div>

					<p>If it&#039;s just a one-time thing, I&#039;d get you both onto teamviewer and then you managing his router from his computer (be it lucy or telnet/ssh) -- you&#039;ll have full control.</p>									</div>
