					<p>I&#039;ve been trying hard to get a Netgear WNDR3800 operational with openwrt over the last few days. I cannot get the WAN to connect. I can access luci fine but no WAN.</p><p>Is this an openwrt problem specific to wndr3800? or am I likely to have this problem if I go out and buy another/different router model?</p><p>I&#039;m willing to guy buy a new router if it means getting openwrt operational. Any advice would be much appreciated.</p><p>Assuming this issue is specific to the wndr3800 model, can you recommend a &quot;high performance&quot; router for openwrt that is not going to give me any issues in getting openwrt working? I don&#039;t care make/model, just something with good cpu and ram.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>PS: flashed openwrt-12.09 from netgear firmware v1.0.0.16</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bmo</strong> on 31 May 2014, 19:54)</p>

					<p>Are you first time setting it up?&nbsp; You need figure out what kind of WAN connection your ISP provides.&nbsp; Some provides direct connect with DHCP support and the others need you to dial up ppoe which requires user id and password.&nbsp; Look at your old router to figure out how it was connected.&nbsp; If you are using Verizon FIOS and the old on was using COAX, you have to call them to switch data port to ethernet.</p>									</div>

					<p>hey, thx for the response.</p><p>I&#039;ve got dynamic IP with DHCP support (ISP does not require username/password or anything like that). In my attempts to get openwrt working I spoofed the MAC from old router and reset the cable modem. I also tried statically assigning the current (working) IP address, subnet, gateway, etc. All of these attempts failed. When I reconnect my old router everything works fine. so it seems specific to openwrt.</p><p>Can I ask what router you are using? I assume openwrt? Is there anything I can go out and buy that will &quot;just work&quot; with openwrt?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bmo</strong> on 31 May 2014, 20:43)</p>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if you have to release the ip address before switching the router.&nbsp; I&#039;m using Verizon FIOS and WNDR3800 with OpenWRT.&nbsp; Verizon FIOS memorizes the old mac.&nbsp; It&#039;s a must to either release the ip on the old router before switching or have to call Verizon to release the ip (power off ONT for a half hour also works).&nbsp; If I don&#039;t do it, the new router won&#039;t work even cloning the old mac.</p>									</div>
