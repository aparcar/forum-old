					<p>I have the Solwise WAP-154G/EU unit and have been experiencing some problems with it - namely that I cannot get it to act as a wireless repeater and allow my PS2 to access the network via the ethernet port at the same time (despite the options being available in the web configuration system).</p><p>I stumbled to this site and after spending a few hours reading, am not at all sure if this unit can run OpenWrt, or if it can, which firmware to download and how to get it on.&nbsp; I have full access to the web configuration firmware upgrade and also have telnet access (which reports &quot;Atheros Access Point Rev 3.0.0.43A&quot; when I log on).&nbsp; I have a TFTP server on my PC and have tried uploading a number of files to the unit, but nothing seems to be happening...</p><p>If anyone can give me some advice on how to proceed here, that would be great.&nbsp; I am experienced in setting up networks, PCs etc. I have just never done this before and would appreciate a guide to get me through it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>Cheers.</p><p>Simon.</p>									</div>

					<p>Can anyone help?&nbsp; It&#039;s been a couple of months and I&#039;m still none the wiser about this.&nbsp; My current setup is a Windows XP machine and basically I want to know if it is possible to, from this, compile (if necessary) and install OpenWRT in some form on my WAP-154G (Atheros chipset) device?&nbsp; At the moment it&#039;s fairly useless to me as it doesn&#039;t work properly and OpenWRT looks like it&#039;d use the hardware a lot better, enabling me to put this box to work!</p><p>I&#039;d really appreciate any help anyone could give me, I&#039;m really not sure how to proceed (or indeed if it is possible on this unit) and I just can&#039;t seem to get anywhere from the docs and forums on this site.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Simon.</p>									</div>
