					<p>Hello, I have those two routers (Linksys WRT120N and Belkin f5d7230-4) and I want to install openwrt in either one of them. Neither of them is in &quot;supported devices&quot;, but I couldn&#039;t find anything that says that it won&#039;t work (dd-wrt does not work on wrt120n, don&#039;t know if it would mean that openwrt won&#039;t work either).</p><p>So my question is, someone knows if openWRT works in either of these routers? Also, can I try to install it, or test it in some way, without bricking them? (linksys is already bricked, I hope its a soft brick)</p><p>Thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>belkin -&gt; version 1444<br />Accordingly to what I found, it says that it also has 2mb flash so no luck either, right?</p><p>I know it is not strictly about openwrt but do you know any alternative as to try to make linksys wrt120n work again? Or did I just get a new frisbee? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>If I increase a flash from 2MB to 8MB, then should openWRT (Attitude Adjustment release 12.09 RC1) support WRT120N?</p><p>Please provide your valuable inputs.</p><p>Thanks,<br />Bhavik</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,<br />increase means soldering a new flash chip with correct bootloader/firmware.<br />CPU is atheros(qualcom) so it should be possible to be supported in the trunk - but NO Attitude Adjustment release 12.09 RC1<br />for &lt;20 E/$ for a tl-wr740n openwrt compatible device i don&#039;t think it worth the trouble</p><p>just my 2c</p>									</div>
