					<p>What&#039;s the best way to block module loading on an OpenWRT image?</p><p>I have a WRT1900AC, and with all of the wifi issues ongoing, I&#039;d like to use it just as a wired router. As such, I want to disable the compat, cfg80211, mac80211, and mwlwifi kernel modules so they never get loaded.</p><p>Note that I&#039;m not just looking to disable the wireless interface, but never load the kernel module at all (since it causes stability issues). The standard Linux modprobe mechanism isn&#039;t used, so it doesn&#039;t appear that I can prefix the module line with &#039;blacklist&#039;. Is simply removing the /etc/modules.d/50-mwlwifi file sufficient and a supported path, or is there a better mechanism? I&#039;d like to be able to use images as built instead of building my own, but entirely removing the kmod-{cfg80211,mac80211,mwlwifi} packages may be another option.</p>									</div>

					<p>In openwrt kmodloader executable is responsible for loading kmods.<br />It&#039;s executed several times. For rom only, for overlay, for extroot.<br />/etc/modules.d will help only if module is not present in /rom/etc/modules.d<br />rom&#039;s modules.d are in squashfs and can be altered on compilation stage by editing some mk files<br />I havent tested that but it can also be possible to remove kmods in image builder.<br />Anyway to alter rom you need to customize image<br />Also its possible to rmmod in /etc/rc.local</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 13 Apr 2016, 10:19)</p>

					<p>I&#039;d like to avoid having to roll my own image. My initial testing shows that simply removing the /etc/modules.d/50-mwlwifi file is sufficient to not trigger the module loading. This implies that module loading is not auto/dependency based. I am just interested in if that is the best way to handle this situation or if there is a better approach to use.</p>									</div>
