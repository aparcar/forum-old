					<p>GNU Screen is a great utility that allows you to have multiple workspaces but perhaps more importantly allows you to start a program executing, detach from the session and then re-attach to that session later to see any updates on the output.&nbsp; Very useful if you have to log into your router remotely say from a laptop to start a program then log into it again later from a different location to see the results of the program.</p><p>I wanted to setup GNU Screen on my router with a number of workspaces configured automatically at SSH login, the problem with that is if you establish a second SSH session the whole environment is duplicated again, and again et al.....</p><p>What I wanted therefore was a single setup with say 4 workspaces that the SSH session would, if detected, log into that existing environment rather then create a new one.</p><p>GNU Screen will allow this by using it&#039;s multiuser functionality.</p><p>To do this you need to edit 2 files and create a batch script which I&#039;ve done for you below.</p><p>Firstly ensure that GNU Screen is installed on your router.</p><p>opkg install screen</p><p>Now the first thing is to edit your SSH file which is </p><p>vi /etc/profile</p><p>then add the following two lines to the bottom of the file</p><p>#&nbsp; Make GNU Screen the default setup for SSH logins<br />/usr/sbin/autosshscreen</p><p>Now save the file and exit.</p><p>Now lets add some stuff to our GNU Screen config file....the following is just an example, you should play with you own setup.</p><p>vi /etc/screenrc</p><p>startup_message off</p><p>multiuser on<br />acladd root</p><p>screen -t ash 0<br />screen -t htop 1 htop</p><p>#&nbsp; You can add other sessions here as you require, please read GNU Screen documents for examples.</p><p>select ash</p><p># This determines the default session you appear in when connecting.</p><p>hardstatus alwayslastline<br />hardstatus string &#039;%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{= kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B} %D %d %M %{W}%C %a %{g}]&#039;</p><p>#&nbsp; The hardstatus string above generates a permanent line at the bottom of the display to show data like router name, Screen sessions and current date and time.<br />#&nbsp; This string is very flexible and you should explore customising it for your own needs.</p><p>Now save the file and exit.</p><p>Lastly we have to create the autosshscreen script referenced earlier.</p><p>vi /usr/sbin/autosshscreen</p><p>#!/bin/ash</p><p>SCREENRUNNING=`pgrep screen`</p><p>if [ -z &quot;$SCREENRUNNING&quot; ]; then</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo &quot;Screen not running so let&#039;s start the Master session&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; screen -S Master</p><p>else</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo &quot;Screen is already running let&#039;s connect to existing session&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; screen -x root/Master</p><p>fi</p><p>Now save this file and ensure you make its permissions executable.</p><p>Now on your PC or laptop open a new terminal session and ssh to the router.</p><p>ssh 192.168.1.1 (or whatever your routers IP address is)</p><p>If it&#039;s all worked properly you should see a message telling you that the router is starting the Master session followed by a display with the hardstatus information line at the bottom.</p><p>Now on your PC open another terminal session and ssh to the router again......</p><p>ssh 192.168.1.1 (or whatever is your routers IP address)</p><p>This time you should see a message telling you that Screen is already running before seeing the hardstatus line.</p><p>If you keep both terminal sessions visible on your display and type into one, you should see the type appearing immediately on the other as well.</p><p>That&#039;s it.......now instead of having maybe four or five ssh sessions to your router to allow you to do different things you should only need one or two.</p><p>If you want to get really funky GNU Screen even allows you to display more then one session at the same time using split commands but that&#039;s outside the scope of this HOWTO.</p><p>Hope someone finds this useful..</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pinnoccio</strong> on 23 Aug 2012, 05:07)</p>
