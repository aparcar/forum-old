					<p>Hi all,</p><p>Recently on my netgear wndr4300, I started getting the following errors and the 5G radio stopped working...</p><p>[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.320000] end_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock0, sector 128<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.320000] Buffer I/O error on device mtdblock0, logical block 16<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.330000] end_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock0, sector 128<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.330000] Buffer I/O error on device mtdblock0, logical block 16<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.470000] end_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock4, sector 72<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.470000] Buffer I/O error on device mtdblock4, logical block 9<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.490000] end_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock4, sector 128<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.490000] Buffer I/O error on device mtdblock4, logical block 16</p><p>The errors don&#039;t appear continuously but only at bootup.<br />I thought there could be some corruption with the firmware so I thought to update to the latest openwrt.</p><p>However, as per /proc/mtd, mtd0 is uboot and mtd4 is language partition. <br />root@OpenWrt:~# cat /proc/mtd<br />dev:&nbsp; &nbsp; size&nbsp; &nbsp;erasesize&nbsp; name<br />mtd0: 00040000 00020000 &quot;u-boot&quot;<br />mtd1: 00040000 00020000 &quot;u-boot-env&quot;<br />mtd2: 00040000 00020000 &quot;caldata&quot;<br />mtd3: 00080000 00020000 &quot;pot&quot;<br />mtd4: 00200000 00020000 &quot;language&quot;<br />mtd5: 00080000 00020000 &quot;config&quot;<br />mtd6: 00300000 00020000 &quot;traffic_meter&quot;<br />mtd7: 00200000 00020000 &quot;kernel&quot;<br />mtd8: 01700000 00020000 &quot;ubi&quot;<br />mtd9: 01900000 00020000 &quot;firmware&quot;<br />mtd10: 00040000 00020000 &quot;caldata_backup&quot;<br />mtd11: 06000000 00020000 &quot;reserved&quot;</p><p>I had some old md5s of all the partitions and comparing them with the current, everything was fine. That means uboot, caldata, pot etc. were intact i.e. no corruption.<br />However, I found one thing, when I tried to do a md5sum on /dev/mtdblock0, it gave an error but an md5sum on mtd0 was fine and matching with my backup.</p><p>Isn&#039;t mtdblock0 is same as mtd0 and maps to same nand region, just that former is a block device representation and later is a character special device?</p><p>Anyways, I flashed the latest trunk openwrt and I still have the same errors...<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.586148] mount_root: loading kmods from internal overlay<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.786386] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock0, sector 128<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.794196] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock0, sector 128<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.800650] Buffer I/O error on dev mtdblock0, logical block 16, async page read<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.876562] Atheros AR8216/AR8236/AR8316 ag71xx-mdio.0:00: Port 5 is up<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.948745] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock4, sector 72<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.961649] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock4, sector 128<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.969513] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mtdblock4, sector 128<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;10.975964] Buffer I/O error on dev mtdblock4, logical block 16, async page read<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;11.136796] UBIFS (ubi0:1): background thread &quot;ubifs_bgt0_1&quot; started, PID 485<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;11.261496] UBIFS (ubi0:1): recovery needed<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;11.472243] UBIFS (ubi0:1): recovery completed<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;11.476865] UBIFS (ubi0:1): UBIFS: mounted UBI device 0, volume 1, name &quot;rootfs_data&quot;<br />[&nbsp; &nbsp;11.484814] UBIFS (ubi0:1): LEB size: 126976 bytes (124 KiB), min./max.

Again the errors are only during bootup.<br />My 5G radio is now working and everything else seems to be working but these errors are annoying and I&#039;m wondering what is really corrupted.</p><p>Is it uboot and language partitions that have bad sectors. If yes, then why the md5sum was fine?<br />Is it firmware/rom partition but then why it is reported as mtdblock0 and mtdblock4?</p><p>Please help.</p><p>Thanks,<br />- Kamal N</p>									</div>

					<p>Run badblocks on all mtds several times.<br />Looks like flash got broken. Did you write a lot to it ? May be constantly updating logs were there ?<br />I see its not about u-boot but can be related to other broken region</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>bolvan</strong> on 29 Feb 2016, 16:46)</p>

					<p>At least some reply. Thank you.</p><p>I don&#039;t have many writes on the nand, in fact the firmware upgrade was after an year.<br />My /var and /tmp are mounted on tmpfs so I believe that should not write to nand either.</p><p>But what is mtdblock0 and mtdblock4? They don&#039;t seem to be uboot or language partitions as error comes near mounting rootfs (guess) but then shouldn&#039;t it be mtdblock8/9 because that is what /rom is.</p>									</div>
