					<p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I updated my firmware to openwrt-wrt150n-2.6-squashfs.bin, I have a linksys v1.1 wrt150n.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I finished with the update and had waited a while for it to finish updating, but it wouldn&#039;t function.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I rebooted.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now when it boots the power light comes on for a few seconds then turns off.&nbsp; &nbsp;I succeeded in getting into safemode but I can only telnet into the router with the windows hyperterminal, I tried winscp and followed instructions to connect but maybe I have the wrong ones, that didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway since I am able to get in thru telnet, is there a way I can use hyperterminal to upload a new firmware and flash it again to fix my boot problem?&nbsp; Thank you very much in advance.</p>									</div>

					<p>Ok that worked and I got the password changed (I verified by trying hyperterm after closing it and I get an error so I know its now wanting ssh) but I can&#039;t get winscp to connect to the router.&nbsp; After I changed the password is there a command I need to run to log out with hyperterm?&nbsp; I just type exit and close hyper term.</p><p>I set winscp to 192.168.1.1&nbsp; port 22 or 23 makes no difference<br />username root&nbsp; &nbsp;password (that I entered in Hyperterm)<br />File Protocol SCP<br />I get &quot;Network Error Connection refused&quot;<br />If I reboot the router it loses its password so I have to input it again.<br />Is there any other settings in winscp that I need to check?</p>									</div>
