					<p>Hi,<br />I have build firmware for my TP-Link MR3020 device, so I want to add support of 3G/4G devices, but when I add any packages, the Build gets failed due to FLASH size limitation (4 MB). How can i overcome this and add support for USB devices?</p>									</div>

					<p>He totally can, but my bet is that he won&#039;t.</p><p>If it&#039;s just one single package without dependencies, you can just drop the ipk into the packages directory. But the syntax of the repositories.conf is kinda self-explanatory, so please be more specific as to what the hurdle is.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />My hurdle is the creation of IPK file, I ave tried to create IPK file using the following syntax but its not generating the ipk file.</p><p>make package/utils/mypackage/compile<br />make package/utils/mypackage/install<br />make package/index</p><p>if I build the complete firmware, this package gets included the final build. I want to include this package in the image generated by Image Generator. Thanks</p>									</div>

					<p>I was able to create the IPK file, I was doing a silly mistake. i didnt selected the packages using make menuconfig, once I selected the packages. The above commands created the output.</p>									</div>
