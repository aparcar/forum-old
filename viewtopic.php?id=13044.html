					<p>I&#039;ve been browsing these forums for a while now, since I&#039;m very interested in running (an open) Linux on a Linksys wireless router. The low cost and power consumption of the hardware are especially appealing.</p><p>Unfortunately, the 8/32MB version of the WRT54GS is very hard to come by. I want to get a WRT54GL so I can be sure it supports OpenWRT or other open source distros. But since it&#039;s got only half the amount of RAM and ROM, I&#039;d like to add an SD-card for extra storage.</p><p>I&#039;m not looking for a NAS/leech solution, just a way of expanding the limited RAM and ROM of the GL so I can run &quot;whatever&quot; program I want without having to keep an eye on the disk space.</p><p>So far, I&#039;ve read about people modding their Linksys to connect an SD card and having trouble partitioning / formatting / mounting it. I don&#039;t read about their actual use for it.<br />My question is this: will the added SD card allow me to install extra programs (mount it on /usr/local or something) and use part of it as swap partition / file?</p>									</div>
