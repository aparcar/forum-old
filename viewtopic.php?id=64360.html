					<p>I&#039;ve asked problem in this link before. <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=318612#p318612">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 12#p318612</a><br />I can get along this problem with taking all ipv4 packages to the network layer and new rule is <br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p IPv4  -j redirect --redirect-target ACCEPT  </code></pre></div><p>But new problem is client which tried to connect to access point which is bridge&nbsp; can not take ip from main router when ebtables rule is active. But when I flushed the rule, client can take ip and I applied the same ebtables rule again, client can connect to the internet without problem. As I understand, problem is about dhcp request can not be made when ebtables rule is active. Any idea how can I solve this problem ?</p>									</div>
