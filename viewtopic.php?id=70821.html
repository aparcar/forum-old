					<p>Apologies if this has already been covered . . .&nbsp; but having installed OpenWrt v15.05.1 with the expectation of using OpenSSL along with the associated Luci menu (&#039;Services&#039; - &#039;OpenVPN&#039;) but found to my surprise that the &#039;luci-app-openvpn&#039; package was unavailable for download.</p><p>I was able to install the openvpn-openssl but unfortunately there was no sign of the luci-app-openvpn package, neither in the &#039;Available&#039; or &#039;Installed&#039; packages lists.</p><p>So after a bit of head-scratching I decided to install OpenWrt v15.05 and interestingly after installing OpenSSL the menu appeared without having to add the additional packages, so it would appear that it comes included.</p><p>I am therefore curious to enquire whether this may just be an oversight or whether there is a compatibility issue when using &#039;luci-app-openvpn&#039; with OpenWrt v15.05.1 and hence not currently available.&nbsp; If this is the case, are there any plans to include it with this version OpenWrt.</p><p>Many thanks</p><br /><p><strong>OpenWrt v15.05.01</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;openvpn-openssl&nbsp; &nbsp; v2.3.6-5</p><p><strong>OpenWrt v15.05</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;openvpn-openssl&nbsp; &nbsp; v2.3.6-5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;luci-app-openvpn git-15.248.30277-3836b45-1 [came pre-packaged with the above]</p>									</div>
