					<p>Hi there, i need my help with my TL-WR703N.. i purchased the unit in china, and didn&#039;t work at first. I could ping the unit and had dhcp address supplied, but could&#039;nt access the web interface by lan and neither see any wifi signal. Another strange fast was the the MAC address printed under the box doesnt match the one given by a newtork scanner while connected to lan.</p><p>Back home i had an old serial-&gt;ttl so i decided to give it a try to revive it.</p><p>the device board has no stickers on the lan connector. on the beard there&#039;s wirtten Rev1.0 CA-F121, so i&#039;m unsure with version i got (im referring to <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a> )</p><p>I was able to flash the original chinese firmware links on that page and the router came back to life, i could access the web interface but no had wifi at all.</p><p>I also tried to flash the Trunk(r35037) and it correctly booted, but i couldn&#039;t get any wifi. the file /etc/config/wireless is missing and the command wifi detect ouputs nothing.</p><p>I found in the boot logs that the system is unable to initialize the wireless device. i could post detailed log if somebody is willing to give help.</p><p>Do you think i could rescue it, or is could be just fried?</p><p>Thanks!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>blurp76</strong> on 24 Feb 2013, 13:17)</p>

					<p>Wow, thanks to the amazing support of nebbia88 we were able to bring back to life the poor WR703N</p><p>He sent me a backup of his ART partition and we were able to reflash it in UBoot with these commands:</p><br /><div class="codebox"><pre><code>tftpboot 0x81000000 art.bin
erase 0x9f3f0000 +0x10000
cp.b 0x81000000 0x9f3f0000 0x10000
bootm 9f020000</code></pre></div><p>It might not be its specific art partition, but wifi seems to work just fine, i&#039;d attach the file here but i don&#039;t this it&#039;s possible on this forum...</p>									</div>
