					<p>Hi there,</p><p>just a short question. Do I still need to compile OpenWRT myself for the WNDR3700 and 802.11a to work or can I just grab the official?</p><p>I actually already tried the official, but it seemed a bit buggy. Wouldn&#039;t turn on, then suddenly turn on and stuff like that. So my actual question is: &quot;Should it work?&quot;.</p><p>Also it would only let me do channel 1+5 for HT on 2.4 GHz. I couldn&#039;t get any other combination accepted. I would have liked 7+11, because my neighbour already runs on 1+5.</p><p>Thank you for your expertise.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>xelra</strong> on 28 Jan 2013, 01:26)</p>

					<p>What you mean by &quot;official&quot; and &quot;pre-compiled&quot;?<br />Current trunk snapshot? Attitude Adjustment rc version? Or the ancient Backfire?</p><p>Compiling it by yourself enables you to include the additional packages you want. When compiled into the firmware, they take less flash space than if they are added later.</p><p>As far as I know, the 5 GHz is quite normally available in 3700.

					<p>If it is in the <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org">http://downloads.openwrt.org</a> area, then it is &quot;official&quot;: that doesn&#039;t make it stable. Current stable is Attitude adjustment rc1.<br />Unless you are:<br />a. happy with compiling source<br />b. unhappy with known bugs on precompiled downloads<br />c. running out of room due to opkg installs<br />Then stay with AArc1<br />(memory aide: create a shortcut for that, I could use it every day)</p>									</div>

					<p>Thank you for the valuable information. </p><p>I will try Attitude Adjustment RC1. OMG, I was still on Backfire 10.03.1. When you go to openwrt.org, it&#039;s still the upmost headline. How am I supposed to know that Attitude Adjustment is actually a new version if it&#039;s not advertised?</p><p>Thank you, now I know. Maybe my WiFi problems will be solved with AA RC1.</p>									</div>
