					<p>Hi, I&#039;m struggling with my old 6200nl, no image I compile from trunk works, even when I use barrier breaker build root. Whatever I flash, router does not boot. I don&#039;t have serial cable to see what&#039;s going on, but I guess it will be some kernel panic, because it is dead very soon after power up (no sign of led activity, power and eth are on, but not a single blink), only Tftp recovery works when turn on and hold reset.</p><p>With hnyman&#039;s help I was able to build old pre-AA image. It looks like the router tries to boot at least (leds are blinking, but I cannot telnet/ssh too), maybe because 6200nl was not supported yet at that time:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67113">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67113</a></p><p>Problems are probably because of this swtich bug:<br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12125">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/12125</a></p><p>There have been an edimax guru called Guenti, which made some patch to fix switch issue and even compiled images:<br /><a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=205640#p205640">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php â€¦ 40#p205640</a></p><p>However all links to guenti&#039;s dropbox are dead, which is no wonder, beacuse the thread is serveral years old ;-) I don&#039;t know, if that dude is still around.</p><p>I need this router as a dumb bridge from usb to ethernet, because I want to use it with lte modem (alcatel l850v) in rndis mode. I need specifically kmod-usb-cdc-ether, kmod-usb-net-rndis and usb-modeswitch, with these 3 checked I have compiled firmware for my old 842nd v1, plug the lte stick and it works like a charm. But I need to put the router on the top of the roof for better signal and wr842nd does not fit into a pet bottle. This is where I could perfectly use that old edimax router. I should have thrown that crap away long time ago, but I still have it and I know it could be done, only I don&#039;t know how right now, it does not have to be electro waste (yet) ;-) Without luci the barrier breaker openwrt works fine even on 16MB only.</p><p>I managed to found some old images which I built myself and they work, but how I made them I don&#039;t recall and kernel modules are specific to the exact build, so I&#039;m unable to install the required kernel modules (and the ton of dependencies), not even manually.</p><p>Whatever I compile now just bricks the router. I&#039;m clueless, but relentless :-) Thank you for help.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s quite obvious to me what is wrong. It&#039;s the switch/network config.</p><p>Initial support for the 6200nl was added with <a href="https://git.lede-project.org/c1710901c5cd47717e972798bbc6108f5be55652">c1710901c5cd47717e972798bbc6108f5be55652</a>.

The mlw221 network config was added _within_ the existing block.</p><p>Long story short, would you please try the following patch and report back whether your issue is fixed.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mkresin</strong> on 9 Sep 2016, 14:07)</p>

					<p>Hi and thank you. I cannot use the patch (1. the file 02_network is in another directory (I&#039;m on barrier breaker build root and found it in /target/linux/ramips/base-files/etc/uci-defaults), 2. line numbers do not match, 3. I cannot recall how to make a patch <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />), BUT I figured that I need to replace eth0.2 for eth0.1, which is what I can do in a vi editor. I found only one occurence 6200nl with eth0.1 on line 55, but on line +-194 there&#039;s nothing like in your patch. Now compiling again. On AA there no 02_network file.</p><p>Should I make clean/dirclean/distclean or compiler will notice the change in the 02_network file and compile with the change? Thank you.</p><p>For CC and DD the patch path looks correct, but I doubt CC or DD can run on 16MB ram.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 8 Sep 2016, 16:50)</p>

					<p>Well, than switch back to trunk. Patching an outdated BB doesn&#039;t make any sense to me. The patch goes to trunk anyway to be part of the next release.

					<p>Hi, I have tried to compile barrier breaker and also trunk (after aplying your patch) and it still behaves the same, I flash the router, it restarts and power + eth leds are on, but router is dead. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with openwrt on this device now, my builds for tp links are fine. Shame that I cannot find my old nokia cable to see what&#039;s going on, so I have ordered another one from china (I could not believe it costs $0.60 incl. shipping), but it will take month to arrive.</p><p>I have no idea what could have changed or what am I doing wrong now, but I have found some bin built quite recently (in april 2016), it was compiled without patch and yet it boots fine. It&#039;s barrier breaker, I remeber I played with triggerhappy and I have surely not patched anything.</p><p>Could I screw something by unselecting packages in make menuconfig? I usually unselect ipv6 support and ppp, but tried once with default settings, just made menuconfig, exit, save changes, let it build, flash and bricked router as always <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah, having the serial output would make this way easier. But I&#039;ve a few ideas how we can proceed even without having access to serial console.</p><p>I still suspect that something is wrong with the switch/ethernet config. We can patch the source code to enable the wireless by default and you might be able to login via wireless into the router. This way it would be possible to check what is wrong with the switch/ethernet.</p><p>Somewhere at the end of the file package/kernel/mac80211/files/lib/wifi/mac80211.sh you will find the template that is used to create the default wifi config. Please remove the line &quot;option disabled 1&quot; to enable wifi by default. Compile a new image and install.</p><p>It&#039;s great that you have a working BB revision. We can use this revision as starting point to find the commit that breaks the network. Would you please install your working BB image into the router and report the exact revision that is used. It should be shown on telnet/ssh login.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mkresin</strong> on 9 Sep 2016, 17:05)</p>

					<p>Thank you very much for your help and interest in this problem. I have obtained lede trunk, scripfeeded &#039;n&#039; upgraded, patched (both hunks of your patch now worked perfectly), compiled and guess what, the same result <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/sad.png" width="15" height="15" alt="sad" /> I left even ipv6 enabled, but removed ppd.</p><p>Your idea is great, but the way I see it, there is probably something else than the switch breaking things. When openwrt boots on this device, power led should blink, but this is not happening, I guess the router bricks once it leaves uboot, maybe kernel panic, but without serial it&#039;s a pure guess. I can turn the wifi on before compilation, recompile and reboot, but I don&#039;t think it is the switch alone. Yes, it could be the switch, but maybe in combination with something else.</p><p>Openwrt has to be flashed via mtd from telnet and sysupgrade image is used even when flashing from factory. The factory.bin is generated by make too, but I never used one, it has probably some header, but it cannot be flashed directly from web interface.</p><p>The working old bin image I have is this:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> === IMPORTANT ============================
