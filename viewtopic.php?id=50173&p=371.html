					<p>Yes, but if you byo it is in the current DD change set so you do not have to get it explicitly, other than have your build tree current.<br />Whatever the current issues are I suppose, minor stuff.<br />That is the date of the last mwlwifi change from the mwlwifi github;i.e. it is not a change set.<br /><a href="http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/">http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/</a><br /><a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/timeline">https://dev.openwrt.org/timeline</a><br />And if you&#039;re not there and so inclined try: irc #openwrt</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>anomeome</strong> on 28 Dec 2015, 01:57)</p>

					<p>So... just to reiterate, we shouldn&#039;t flash the latest trunk builds because its missing the 990 patch? Builldbot successfully built last night (Dec 28th r48005) and uploaded the images unlike the build a day or two before.
