					<p>How can I cap bandwidth to/from the WAN on a certain ESSID? I&#039;ve tried qos-scripts, which should do far more, but it doesn&#039;t seem to actually cap things-- a download attempt still succeeded in 200+KB/sec when I have a 56k cap.<br />Any ideas?</p>									</div>

					<p>QoS is usually just for outgoing traffic, not for incoming. While you have total control over which packet to send and when, you can influence the packets you receive only indirectly, for example by dropping already received packets. For example if I ping your IP, I&#039;m sending ping packets to you, which is beyond your control... all you can do, is drop or ignore them, but I&#039;ll continue sending them anyway, taking away some bits of your bandwidth. If you download something, you have very little control over the rate of packets that the other side is sending to you. All you can do is drop a couple of packets and hope that the other side will slow down because of it.</p>									</div>
