					<p>Earlier this week I installed my first OpenWRT firmware on my Linksys WRT54G Version 2.2.&nbsp; It was factory fresh and had firmware version 3.03.1.&nbsp; I was not successful in setting boot_wait using the methods given in the OpenWRT documentation (<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing</a>), but note that I did not downgrade the firmware as recommended in this documentation.&nbsp; Note particularly that I couldn&#039;t get the ping_times exploit work using the perl script referenced in the documentation. However, I was able to make a shell script that uses a similar exploit (lsysexec.sh found at <a href="http://www.kurokatta.org/doc/wrt54g-hax0ring)">http://www.kurokatta.org/doc/wrt54g-hax0ring)</a> work just fine to set boot_wait with firmware 3.03.1.</p>									</div>
