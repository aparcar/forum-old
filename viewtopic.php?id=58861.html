					<p>I have never seen DLNA used that way... Normally you would have a DLNA server that hosts the media files on a device, and a media player with DLNA client capabilities on another device.</p>									</div>

					<p>Features like that does not exist in MiniDLNA. What you want is PLEX, which is way too resource hungry for a router. It&#039;s also closed source and not packaged for OpenWrt.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for your replies</p><p>I do not think it changes the answer, but I want to be sure.&nbsp; I will have a USB device with media on it connected to the travel router running miniDLNA.&nbsp; I saw a screenshot somewhere that was a web page that is generated by miniDLNA that had the number of photos, videos and audio files.&nbsp; I could not tell if these are links or not to the actual files on the associated device.&nbsp; </p><p>I do not know what application will be on the clients, but I generally have VLC.&nbsp; I have been unable to figure out if this can populate the &quot;Media Library&quot; or show under Upnp.&nbsp; I have never found the VLC help very helpful.</p><p>I currently have a shortcut to the folder which works OK through Explorer,&nbsp; just not as&nbsp; elegant.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>RangerZ</strong> on 6 Aug 2015, 17:53)</p>

					<p>I was not doubting you.&nbsp; As I said I do not think it changes the answer.&nbsp; I wanted someone to confirm what the web page say or does.&nbsp; It&#039;s not documented anywhere.&nbsp; </p><p>I also want to know if this will show in the DLNA section on VLC2.2.0+ as there are VLC bugs related to displaying content from DLNA servers.&nbsp; I do not have VLC working with other DLNA devices I have.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes there is a page typically under ip-address:8200 but this page is an overview about all items in the current db.<br />There is no link or something else to play that media directly from there.</p><p>If you want to play some media files then you need an renderer too.<br />Maybe gmediarenderer and a controll point like bubbleupnp via android.</p><p>But I would say that dlna is the wrong feature for your intention.<br />Write a little script with php, python or something else to bring up an webpage displaying your files and take some js snippets to play it.</p><p>Using VLC as a controllpoint is ok.
