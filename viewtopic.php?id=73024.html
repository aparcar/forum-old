					<p>Having newly installed OpenWRT 15.05 on this router all seems to be going well except that I haven&#039;t succeeded in achieving a DSL connection. I&#039;ve set it up with PPPoATM and the VPI/VCI as my current router (Linksys running stock firmware) and the same as this router running dd-wrt until I broke it.</p><p>The WBMR-HP-G300H page says it comes with Annex B and that I need to remove that and install Annex A. I&#039;ve downloaded the .ipk file suggested but it&#039;s not clear to me what to do next.</p><p>Do I remove the Annex B with opkg remove &lt;some package name which escapes me&gt;? And if so, where do I put the .ipk file downloaded in order that opkg might find it amongst the available packages? I&#039;m confused that /etc/config/network already has option annex &#039;a&#039; in the adsl stanza.</p>									</div>

					<p>Erm, as far as I know ADSL Annex A and Annex B are typically not only differences in software, but also in hardware. Which makes sense if one thinks about the main difference, Annex B carves out some frequencies to happily coexist with ISDN while Annex A only spares the traditional POTS frequency range. so I would guess that both use different high-pass filters at their inputs and hence are not electrically equivalent.</p>									</div>

					<p>I really don&#039;t know about 15.05 anymore, I haven&#039;t used it in over a year. But if you install LEDE (for all intents and purposes the &quot;new&quot; OpenWrt until the release name changes back to OpenWrt, 17.01.4 is the current major version as of this writing) it is as easy as setting <em>option annex &quot;a&quot;</em> in the dsl configuration of /etc/config/network. When booting, the DSL firmware is patched on the fly to the selected Annex.</p><p>But, as moeller0 says, there&#039;s a good chance that you will not get your line to connect. If so, the line filters inside your router could be modified, but that&#039;s advanced soldering you&#039;d be looking at.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 19 Jan 2018, 16:18)</p>

					<p>Thanks folks - the 15.05 image was the only one I could find which was indicated for WBMR-HP-300H.</p><p>After bricking it one more time I&#039;m now on LEDE (as suggested by @metai) having installed WBMRA-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin from 17.01.4/targets/lantiq/xway/</p><p>It wasn&#039;t clear what the difference was between WBMRA and WBMRB as metai said both Annex A and B were incorporated in the build.

					<p>I&#039;ll swear I didn&#039;t change anything. Perhaps it was the cat. But ever since I threatened it with dsl_control status it got a DSL connection and the DSL light came on. It still wasn&#039;t making a DHCP client request to the ISP but I fixed that by setting a PAP/CHAP user name and password, which I was pretty sure my ISP (Talktalk) hasn&#039;t required for years.</p><p>So I think I&#039;m back on the road. Thanks ppl for the help.</p>									</div>
