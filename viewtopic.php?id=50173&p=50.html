At this moment I have the authentication rsa key with 4096 bits. But I can not disable(I don&#039;t know how) authentication for user / pass. There is always someone trying to get in with user root or admin ... my idea was to try to allow only networks in my country. easier than denying all others, but still think it&#039;s too complex for my current knowledge of scripting.<br />About the use of non-stander SSH port number, is a good tip, but in my work there is a limited port numbers that I can use.<br />From what I understand of the tips, the openwrt allows to have only public key auth, I think I&#039;ll try to finish the ssh tunnel on the router.</p>									</div>

					<p>I posted this before in the General Discussion because I thought it was not device specific but after reading the entire thread, and particularly about how the bridge has been made in the 1900AC, I am no longer sure.</p><p>Is about VLANs, been struggling with the following:</p><p>I have been trying to configure my router (Linksys WRT1900AC with Attitude Adjustment) to work with the VLAN of my FTTH provider while, at the same time, allowing the router provider by my ISP work as an analogue phone router (VoIP and the ISP refuses to provide the details).</p><p>The icing in the cake is that the ISP only uses one VLAN for both Data and VoIP, VID 1074, if it used two I think my life would have been like ten times easier...</p><p>So far I have managed to properly configure the wan interface (eth1) with the 1074 VID tagged, after which the router can handle the data connection and anything I plug into it through any of the interfaces (wifi, eth) works just fine.</p><p>Next step is the old router to use for the VoIP. I can barely modify any parameter in this router besides the bare basics (change IP, turn on or off the DHCP...). So I set up a switch in the eth0 interface and enable vlan4k (will provide detailed config below) and I tag one of the ports with the VID 1074 and plug a wire from that port to the WAN port of the other router. Then the other router grabs the IP through DHCP and sprouts to life making the analogue phones work. It is of note that the old router and the openWRT router are always on separate networks (192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0).</p><p>Now comes the problem... After I have made this, the remaining ports of the switch in my OpenWRT router no longer work and all my wired network stops being able to contact the router. If I add eth0 and eth0.1074 to the bridge then it just simply eats all the frames and the phone router stops working. If I add the ports either as tagged or untagged doesn&#039;t change the situation either.</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p><p>This is the /etc/config/network I have been cooking:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config interface &#039;loopback&#039;

					<p>I&#039;ve had to flash version 1.0.1 back. I could not get the &quot;services&quot; tab back. Even installing packages for upnp etc., I received the message that the root file was already up to date. Rebooting did not bring the &quot;services&quot; tab back. I even received a message once that there was a conflict and it filed the package somewhere else. I reverted back to 1.0.1, and no issues.

					<p>Well, I apologize if I missed these instructions somewhere down the line. I have made a habit of unchecking &quot; keep settings&quot;, but maybe I forgot this time when I went to 1.0.5.

					<p>I&#039;ve been running my own BB build, but it&#039;s never been stable, with the wireless connections resetting periodically.&nbsp; So last night I decided to try installing the McWrt build.&nbsp; I was surprised when I went to configure, and it only had WEP, which makes it useless for me.&nbsp; I remember reading earlier in this thread that it couldn&#039;t be used as a bridge because it couldn&#039;t authenticate as a WPA client, but are there any of the WPA authenticator server packages that work with this build?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>									</div>
