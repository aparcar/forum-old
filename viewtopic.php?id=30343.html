					<p>Hi Dick,</p><p>The SkySpotOS GUI is released in three editions:</p><p>1. SkySpotOS Standard - free community edition that can be use with SkySpot Community Cloud Controller or without.<br />2. SkySpotOS Enterprise - free and valid with SkySpot Cloud Controller services.<br />3. SkySpotOS Professional - paid edition with additional interface for external RadiusAAA server and Web based Captive Portal.</p><p>Enterprise and Professional editions have implemented OLSR Mesh mode in 2.4Ghz or 5GHz.</p><p>The SkySpotOS GUI for Ubiquiti RouterStation and RouterStationPRO has currently the same features but different binaries from OpenWRT.<br />The RouterStation PRO has a 1Gigbit Ethernet switch, but RouterStation has 100Mbits Ethernet switch.</p><p>We already prepared and tested AR8316 switch configurations for RouterStationPRO but some additional work is required to implement these configurations in the GUI. The next release for RouterStation PRO will have switch features implemented.</p><p>Regards,<br />Pat</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>skyspotmesh</strong> on 9 Jun 2011, 05:50)</p>

					<p>Hi, I&#039;m most interested in the WNDR3700V1 version and with Mesh.. but it seems I have to wait a few months more as I have the V1 version of this router and you plan to release the V2 version first.</p>									</div>
