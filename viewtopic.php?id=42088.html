					<p>I&#039;m at my wits end and have been searching for an answer everywhere. Hopefully someone can help me.</p><p>I have a router running openwrt which is bridged to my main network using relayd. I can see devices from either side of the bridge and everything is working.</p><p>I have a media server on the main network and a ps3 on the openwrt side both connected via ethernet to their respective devices.&nbsp; The ps3 cannot see the media server at all without the help of igmpproxy. Using igmpproxy i can see the media server if it starts after igmpproxy starts or after an amount of time (maybe 20 mins?) when the media server must to a discovery or something.</p><p>If I manually try to search for media servers on the ps3 it says no servers found and all the servers that were shown disappear.</p><p>Using tcpdump i see that the ps3 is sending out 3 or 4 udp packets to 239.255.255.250 on port 1900 but they do not get relayed to the main network.</p><p>i&#039;ve tried every setting in igmpproxy, as well as trying udp-broadcast-relay, miniupnpd, snat and dnat but nothing seems to be working.</p><p>miniupnpd might be what i need but the website is not really helpful in explaing what it actually does. picked up the SSDP packets and gave me a wall of text and some chain errors but it didnt do anything either. I&#039;m getting confused between upnp - the media side and upnp - the port forwarding side. i understand the differences but not how people refer to one another.</p>									</div>
