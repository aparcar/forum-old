					<p>Hi all, I&#039;ve been at this for a while and I can&#039;t seem to figure out what is going wrong with this setup.</p><p>I am trying to create a portable router with an external root fs (Kingston data traveler 16gb usb flash drive, 12gb EXT4 and 2gb linux-swap partitions), a secondary usb wireless adapter (Comfast wireless N using rt2800 drivers), and a generic 4 port unpowered usb hub. My router is a TP-Link wr703n that has a uboot of 1.1.4 (Mar 21 2013 - 10:09:10) with the original firmware of 130321.</p><p>[bold]<br />EDIT: Here is a list of parts off ebay that I have purchased in case it can lead to more clues.<br /><a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/171150132273">http://www.ebay.ca/itm/171150132273</a><br /><a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/360736656712">http://www.ebay.ca/itm/360736656712</a><br /><a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/271209804263">http://www.ebay.ca/itm/271209804263</a><br />[/bold]</p><p>I have the router serial modded and I have tried various images with varying degrees of success.</p><p>Here I will describe my experiences with the firmwares I flashed and hopefully someone can suggest a firmware that will work, or tell me a solution to some of the symptoms I have been having.</p><p>AA 12.09-beta1 / beta2:<br />This firmware made the Ethernet port defective and would not respond to anything. I read later on that this image as well as others behaved poorly with my version of the router and in order to fix this I would need to flash a new image. I did not spend much time on these images for testing.</p><p>AA 12.09:<br />This version fixed the Ethernet port problem and I successfully extrooted it to my flash drive and everything was working fine until I attempted to incorporate my USB hub into the mix. The router, normally in the later stages of boot, would simply start spilling error messages about not being able to reset or disable a port with error -145 and I would need to force a restart. This happened most times, but some times I could successfully boot, but later the problem would come back. Here is a output from serial where the bottom half contains the error messages. When I remove the usb hub, and simply attach the flash drive to the router everything works as it should.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>U-Boot 1.1.4 (Mar 21 2013 - 10:09:10)

I don&#039;t have another usb hub on hand to test to see if the hub is faulty, although it works perfectly fine on windows 7. I am not sure if this is fixable by doing a custom compile of the kernel, or if these have deeper seeded issues.</p><p>Just to clarify again, I am trying to setup the router to use extroot on a usb hub so I may also use a secondary supported wireless device for wireless data logging purposes using the aircrack suit. All tests for aircrack compatibility have been made using the internal atheros chipset as well. I also have a friend with the exact same hardware setup as me (same parts from the same manufactures and online retailers), except he has a older model of the router from 2012 if I recall. He currently uses the beta firmware and everything works flawlessly (we have the same hub, flashdrive, wireless usb adapter). </p><p>Thanks for any help or information leading to a solution.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abduct</strong> on 18 Apr 2014, 19:55)</p>

					<p>For the firmware, stick to either 12.09 or trunk/snapshot. Don&#039;t mess with alpha, beta or RC versions, they are just development versions.<br />Regarding the unknown symbols issue with the trunk-snapshot, I would need to double-check, that you issued &quot;opkg update&quot; before installing any other package. Also make sure, that the packages were built at the same time as the firmware image (check the buildbot: <a href="http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/">http://buildbot.openwrt.org:8010/</a> ).<br />To check, if the hardware is causing any issues, you should get together with your friend and exchange one component at a time and test the setup.</p>									</div>

I did notice it saying that it was not running at full speed which confused me as the seller said it was a 2.0 device.

When installing kmod-fs-ext4 and kmod-usb-storage I get a bunch of symbol errors (even after trying opkg update) as denoted in previous posts, although when I get the new hubs I will try again. Thank you for your advice!</p>									</div>

I don&#039;t mind if I need to trim the pcb a but, but I need to find something that can fit inside the original case. I may of found something locally for cheap the same style as the one I original purchased so I am going to give that a shot after the holidays.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>abduct</strong> on 19 Apr 2014, 09:04)</p>
