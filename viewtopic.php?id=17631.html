					<p>Using <a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=17501&amp;p=3">phorn&#039;s switch-ip175c.c</a> I was able to add support for the IP175C of the RB433 to kmod-switch.

					<p>In order to connect port1 and port2 (the two rightmost ethernet jacks) to a two-port switch you need to execute:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>uci set network.0.vlan1=&quot;1 2 5*u&quot;
/etc/init.d/network restart</code></pre></div><p>(don&#039;t forget to commit for making it permanent).</p><p>IMHO there is no hardware-only way to put all three ports together in one switch, as the left jack is connected to a different MAC in the AR71xx.<br />Only the PHY of the IP175C is used. For a software solution you may put eth0 and eth1 into a bridge.</p>									</div>
