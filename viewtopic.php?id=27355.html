					<p>These days, a lot of apartment complex here in the US is offering a free WiFi connection using a private subnet class A. There seemed to be several different ways to connect to an apparment complex WiFi. AFAIK, the simplest way to connect to the apartment complex WiFi is to establish a WiFi connection from a web browser to the apartment complex website. When that connection is done, the computer can then access the Internet through the apartment complex WiFi under a private subnet class A.</p><p>Now, I am trying to help a friend who lives in an apartment complex with a WiFi connection using such a topology. She is using a Linksys WRTP54G VoIP WiFi router (configured to a Comcast Cablemodem device). Currently, I have an extra Fry&#039;s Electronics FR-54RTR WiFi router (a.k.a. DLink DIR-600 rev. A1). I sure don&#039;t mind to give her this router so that she can use it as a WiFi bridge to connect her Linksys WRTP54G VoIP WiFi router to the Internet through the aparment complex WiFi. I sure will appreciate anyone out here who has done this to lend some hands on how to configure this FR-54RTR WiFi router (flashed with an OpenWRT firmware) as a bridge to an apartment complex WiFi.</p>									</div>

My configuration is based on your suggestions as shown above. The router had no problem to connect to the apartment complex WiFi, but a computer connected to the router couldn&#039;t get to the Internet. A <em>ping openwrt.org</em> only showed the IP Address of OpenWRT.org which means the computer was able to pull the IP Address from the router (which pulled from the DNS on the Internet through the apartment complex WiFi). Have you any idea why?</p><p>BTW, I also include IPv6 packages, i.e. 6scripts, 6to4, aiccu, and dhcp6-client, mainly because the apartment complex WiFi supports IPv6. Do you suppose any of IPv6 packages causes the problem?</p>									</div>

					<p>If you&#039;re doing a second NAT at the router (which I think you should), make sure that your LAN address and WAN address are in non-overlapping subnets.</p><p>Also, make sure your MTU is small enough to get through all the obstacles between you and the internet, though if regular ping does not get through, then MTU is not your primary problem.</p><p>Finally, you mention that one needs to keep a webpage open in order to have access. Some captive portals do that. Thus, you somehow need to compel the router to simulate what a browser would be doing in order to keep the connection open.

					<p>OK. Now it works! However, it can only connect to one WiFI eventhough I have installed a multiWAN package. I am hoping to be able to connect to more than one WiFi. Can I have a multiple <em>config wifi-iface sta</em> on /etc/config/wireless file?</p>									</div>
