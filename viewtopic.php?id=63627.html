					<p>Hi, new to this so bear with me...</p><p>I just got my new router, which I thought was supported. But it turns out I got version 2, which is not supported. Before returning it I am wondering how long it might take for this version to become supported? Any info appreciated, thanks!</p>									</div>

					<p>I really do hope a port is accomplished for this v2. I just got one as well thinking it&#039;d be a 1.2.0, but I am not disappointed with it or its stock firmware. I have a few questions though:</p><p>For those of you with v1.2 of this router (the Archer C5), when running OpenWRT does the TP-Link Tether app for smart devices (smartphone/tablet etc) still work with it? That&#039;s one of the most intriguing things about router for me and I&#039;d be sad to give that up when going to OpenWRT vs stock.</p><p>When it comes to the C7 vs this C5, should I &quot;upgrade&quot; to the C7 since it&#039;s supported by OpenWRT, or should I wait... OR should I get a v1.2? I saw it available on NewEgg for around $80. Also what are the advantages of the C7 vs the C5? Faster 5 GHz performance is one thing i saw mentioned all over, but it was also said that most Wireless AC devices can&#039;t take advantage of it...</p><p>Thanks,<br />Shiggitay</p>									</div>

					<p>hi, i&#039;d like to support somehow the creation of the firmware for C50 v2 (not c5!)<br />it&#039;s a really affordable dual band radio, and it seems like ar71xx would work.</p><br /><br /><p>where should I start? I can post photos of the internals if it helps.</p>									</div>

					<p>I&#039;m not sure if anyone has posted a comment like this but I would like to say that I just received this Archer C50 V2.0 to use as a wireless bridge. I was a little bummed when I read there was no OpenWRT firmware for the V2.0...but I decided to take a chance and get it anyway. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the TP-Link firmware was all I needed to accomplish this task. I now have a wireless connection to my main router in another part of the house where it is impossible to run a wire...all lan ports work as well as both wireless bands...this is an awesome router that is pumping some great connection speeds...the best part is brand new it only cost $28.87us!!! Not really sure why OpenWRT is not supporting this router but I guess it really isn&#039;t necessary...</p><p>I&#039;m one happy camper thanks TP-Link for filling this void!!!</p>									</div>
