					<p>I&#039;ve been looking to expand my computer knowledge for a while now and moving onto more technical and fun stuff and figured messing around with routers would be a pretty cool thing to look into and something that&#039;s completely foreign to me. I couldn&#039;t resist the little WR703N however I completely goofed up when I got it lol.&nbsp; Not 100% sure what went wrong however will document what I done and hopefully someone with experience can see what is wrong. </p><p>I connected it via usb to my computer for power and just took the ethernet cable out of my main router and stuck it into the 703N. Not sure if it makes a difference but I didn&#039;t have an active internet connection while flashing it. I was also doing it through windows to save me time getting out my laptop with linux on. </p><p>Anyhow I followed the instructions here :</p><p><a href="http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Install_OpenWRT_on_TPlink_WR703N">http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Install … ink_WR703N</a></p><p>All seemed well but once the upload of the file got to 100% it seemed to get stuck. I left it for about 5-10 mins and nothing.. the only different thing I noticed was the text &quot;downloading proxy&quot; appear in the interface somewhere. I probably stupidly tried disconnecting the power and redoing it and it now it no longer works. </p><p>Not sure what I done wrong tbh and certainly isn&#039;t a good start.. if it matters the version number of it was 1.6. Seeing how cheap they are, I just ordered another one and hopefully with a bit of advice, will have better luck next week.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well, if you wanna get into routers, why not try to un-brick it? <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />That would be good practice and you would learn quite a bit! Plus: extremely satisfactory to see the router working again after you unbrick it. It&#039;s pretty easy, but it would require you to open up the router.</p><p>If you want to, step 1 is to buy an DKU-5 (also known as CA-42) Nokia cable. They&#039;re really cheap - a few Euro/dollars - online.</p><p>Btw: flashing and unbricking can be done from Windows, so no worries about that!</p><br /><p>//edit: to answer your question in the topic title: I don&#039;t think you did anything wrong. It was just bad luck. Take a look here:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/</a><br />This is where the latest revision of Openwrt (known as &quot;trunk&quot;) is automatically uploaded. These are not &quot;stable&quot; releases, but rather the latest and I believe they are uploaded once a week. </p><p>The folders are named after the different chipsets of routers. The WR703N is in the ar71xx folder. You will see a factory file (to flash from stock firmware, like you) and a sysupgrade file, which is for upgrading if you already have openwrt on the device.</p><p>Another tip: read the wiki of your router. It contains so much info.<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n</a></p><p>Info on how to install openwrt on the device, how to enter failsafe (which you can still try!!) to debrick, how to get back to stock firmware, etc</p><p>Here is how to unbrick using the Nokia cable: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n#serial.console">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … al.console</a><br />Here is how to enter failsafe: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n#failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … lsafe.mode</a> (try this first!!)</p><p>read through it <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> it will help!</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Boompje123</strong> on 13 Jul 2013, 23:56)</p>

					<p>Wait.. are you sure the router is actually bricked? Openwrt often doesn&#039;t come with Luci - the webinterface control panel.<br />In this case going to <a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> will give you nothing, you would have to configure it using Telnet/SSH (you can download Putty for that on Windows)</p><p>Maybe connect you computer to the router and try pinging it? (start CMD on Windows - type &quot;ping 192.168.1.1&quot;)<br />Does it give you anything? In which case the router isn&#039;t bricked.</p><p>and no, you do not need internet to flash openwrt <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for the reply.. will definitely get that cable and look to unbrick it (if it is bricked). Already ordered a secondary router but having two working ones couldn&#039;t hurt. Thanks for all the info though, will make sure to have a good read.. have to admit I was guilty of skimming information and just following instructions first time around. </p><p>Hmm.. I assume it&#039;s bricked.. it tried pinging it 4 times and timed out each time.</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi Breeze, you might have missed part of Boompje123&#039;s post, specifically getting into failsafe mode: <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n#failsafe.mode">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl- … lsafe.mode</a></p><p>I&#039;ve soft-bricked my wr703n&#039;s many times, and failsafe has always worked. It is certainly worth a try.</p><p>-Badger</p>									</div>

					<p>Only just checked now and tried the failsafe bit and it&#039;s working.. many thanks to both of you. Now got a spare one to play around with.. any suggestions with what to have a look at doing?</p>									</div>

					<p>First things first: try setting it up to extend your current WiFi. Then, if that is OK it depends what you have and what you want to play with: have a USB webcam? setup a remote feed. Want audio around the house? Get a usb audio card. And all that is before you open it up and start soldering: then the fun really starts!</p>									</div>
