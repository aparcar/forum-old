					<p>Hey guys, I&#039;m planning on buying this router (TL-WR842N v3.1, just in case), as it suffices my needs, and I&#039;d like to know if I can just flash @obsy &#039;s OpenWRT + LuCI build over the stock TP-Link web GUI, without the need of a serial connection, or anything like that.</p><p>Is it stable enough for daily use? Netflix, gaming, p2p, and shit, mostly. I&#039;m looking forward to use LuCI-SQM package, as I really need to minimize bufferbloat.</p><p>I can&#039;t link stuff, but I&#039;m planning on flashing this .bin file <span style="color: red">dl.eko.one.pl/luci/chaos_calmer/ar71xx/luci-15.05-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr842n-v3-squashfs-factory.bin</span></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Beo1r</strong> on 27 Jun 2017, 01:21)</p>
