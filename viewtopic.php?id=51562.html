					<p>I installed OpenWrt though the .img file I got in this thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49189">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=49189</a> by using the default netgear firmware.<br />It worked, but I wanted to update to the newest version of OpenWrt, so after trying a few things and researching I attempted the method descried in this thread <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34277">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34277</a> with the firmware I got from <a href="http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/OpenWRT/">http://www.mcservices.com.au/downloads/OpenWRT/</a></p><p>I am assuming this is were I did something wrong, as the router never rebooted (the power led went orange for a few seconds before turning green and blinking).&nbsp; I attempted to unbrick it by doing the steps described in <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=103295#p103295">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php … 95#p103295</a> with the default netgear firmware (I tried it first with the openwrt firmware, but the file transfer error-ed out repeatedly, the netgear firmware sent correctly the first try).&nbsp; </p><p>Now the router&#039;s power led continues to stay orange, and every few seconds the switch lights all flash on and off, the power led then stays off for a few seconds (with the switch led for my desktop remaining on), before repeating.</p><p>Any ideas to try and fix this?</p>									</div>

					<p>After continuing this loop (for almost two hours), it finally finished loading the netgear firmware, I then flashed the .img file from&nbsp; the mcservices.com.au, and that worked fine as well <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>Unfortunately I tried going from DDWRT to stock firmware using the same procedure as above, before I saw this thread and bricked my WNDR4300 the same way. Now the power button is solid amber and the switch lights flash amber every couple of seconds.<br />I tried holding the reset button down and powering on the router hoping I can get into recovery/tftp mode but it doesn&#039;t work, the power light never turns blinking green, it stays solid amber.</p><p>And I doubt that just waiting will cause it to fix itself, but I&#039;ll leave it on anyway overnight.</p><p>What can I do at this point? Any chance that it can be recovered without a JTAG cable?</p><p>And what is the correct procedure to go from DDWRT to OpenWRT on this router?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>sirowrt</strong> on 10 Oct 2014, 10:16)</p>

					<p>I don&#039;t 100% remember what happened with mine, but I remember I just let it sit long enough and it finally booted into the stock firmware lol.&nbsp; What I would suggest is trying to ssh into it using DDWRT&#039;s failsafe mode (I&#039;m not sure how in DDWRT, but OpenWRT&#039;s is here <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe),">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe),</a> and then either attempting to get back into DDWRT to try again, or flash the firmware from there.&nbsp; If you can get back into stock, flashing the firmware is as simple as going to the update page and selecting OpenWRT&#039;s firmware as the one to update to.&nbsp; </p><p>I believe mcservices has been down for a while, if I can find my old firmware file I&#039;ll upload it.</p><p>Here is a download link <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/linksapps/downloadlinks/openwrt-ar71xx-nand-wndr4300-ubi-factory.img?attredirects=0&amp;d=1">https://sites.google.com/site/linksapps … =0&amp;d=1</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>link07</strong> on 10 Oct 2014, 10:36)</p>

					<p>Looks like mine is done, I think the bootloader is corrupted. It doesn&#039;t respond to pings, the switch lights just keep flashing amber and computers wired to it don&#039;t even see a connection, they think the wire is unplugged. Oh well, it&#039;s not mine, I got it from the ISP so I&#039;ll just have them replace it.</p><p>But in general, what&#039;s the proper procedure do go from DDWRT to OpenWRT? TFTP?</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi.<br />On a Netgear 4300 I installed the corresponding Rooter firmware (<a href="http://ofmodemsandmen.com/downloadsp.html">http://ofmodemsandmen.com/downloadsp.html</a>). The device starts and I can login using wifi. I have access to its GUI console. However, none of the LAN ports are working. When I connect a LAN cable from my PC to the device, the computer still says not connected.<br />Any idea what can be done to restore back to Netgear original firmware?</p>									</div>
