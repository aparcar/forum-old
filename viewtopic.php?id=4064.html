					<p>Chat with Hydranode lead developer:</p><p>----------<br />Wallace78: hey mad, I&#039;m reading the changelog where you say that it supports mips platforms!<br />Wallace78: I met hydranode on OpenWrt forum<br />Wallace78: a guy is trieing to compile hn in OpenWrt buildchain<br />...<br />Madcat: it&#039;s &quot;theoretical&quot; support <br />Madcat: it was never really tested<br />Madcat: doesn&#039;t have a mips around<br />Madcat: IIRC, it had something to do with endianess - I changed the way endianess is detected, so it should run on &quot;unknown&quot; endianess platforms correctly as well.<br />Madcat: but then again, last I checked endianess was fucked up on mac (one of the reasons why 0.2 is being delayed and delayed) so ...<br />Madcat: IIRC, the low-level binary IO methods that cyberz rewrote cpl months ago broke reading/writing little-endian protocols on big-endian platforms.<br />----------</p><p>I didn&#039;t undestand what he said.... I&#039;m not a developer... but I hope this can help you/him.<br />He is searching developers.</p><p>ciao</p><p>Wallace</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>it&#039;s possible make a debian bootstrap that fits on your card.</p><p>debootstrap will do this for you.</p><p>copy all files on your card.</p><p>an mount it with chroot.</p><p>now you can finish your debian installation with debian baseconfig and apt-get update&nbsp; apt-get upgrade</p><p>then u can get mldonkdy with apt-get&nbsp; so you don&#039;t need to compile it on your box. </p><p>but you allways have to mount debian to run mldonkey... </p><p>i think it&#039;s a not realy propper solution.</p><p>greetz SkySurfer</p>									</div>
