					<p>I have OpenVPN TAP set up on my router as a server.&nbsp; I have clients set up on a travel router (OpenWRT OpenVPN Client) and on a Windows laptop (OpenVPN Windows client).&nbsp; The configs are the same, at least as much as they can be.&nbsp; On the laptop I can connect to the server and browse the Windows shares with no problem.&nbsp; On the OpenWRT client (travel router) I can connect, see the shares, but am unable to connect to them by name.&nbsp; I can however connect to them with the IP address of the device, and then browse sub-folders.</p><p>I am of the opion that this is somehow DNS related.&nbsp; <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openvpn.and.dns">http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/openvpn.and.dns</a><br />This wiki looks promising, but I am not CLI competent and there is no config file or Luci documentation.&nbsp; I have also read the Dnsmasq wiki <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dhcp.dnsmasq">http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dhcp.dnsmasq</a> . Do I need to add something that will tell the OpenVPN client the relationship between the IP address and the Windows Share name (dnsmasq.conf, ethers, hosts?).&nbsp; I have configured Static Leases for all the devices. Some match the Windows Share name, others do not, none work.&nbsp; No clue as to how to use the local server / local domain values, or if they are relevant.&nbsp; The config for DHCP and DNS =&gt; Server Settings are default.</p><p>I have included the client and server configs, and I can include whatever else is helpful.&nbsp; Lines with * indicated differences between the two client files.&nbsp; </p><p>Laptop Client<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>remote [myip] 1190
