					<p>hello<br />I would like to run my own local DNS resolver. Unfortunately, dnsmasq isn&#039;t cable of doing this, so i want to install a DNS server that can do this on its own. I chose to use MaraDNS, but because it doesn&#039;t have dnsmasq&#039;s built-in DHCP server and /etc/hosts integration, I decided that I would run both of them simultaneously. the router&#039;s IP address is on 192.168.1.1<br />i have been told to add a second address of 192.168.1.2, where maradns would listen <br />so i&#039;ve been told to follow the steps below<br />Step one, add a virtual address of 192.168.1.2 Add these lines to your /etc/config/network file:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; config &#039;alias&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;proto&#039; &#039;static&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; option &#039;ipaddr&#039; 192.168.1.2<br />...and then run /etc/init.d/network restart.</p><p>Step two, configure dnsmasq to listen only on 127.0.0.1 and 10.4.0.1. OpenWRT&#039;s configuration files don&#039;t provide any method to access the --listen-address option, so it will be necessary to add it to the startup line in the /etc/init.d/dnsmasq script:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --listen-address=127.0.0.1 --listen-address=10.4.0.1 $args &amp;&amp; {</p><p>Also add option nonwildcard 1 to the dnsmasq section of your /etc/config/dhcp file, and then restart dnsmasq with /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart.</p><p>If you now run netstat -lutpn | grep 53, you&#039;ll see that dnsmasq is only bound to those IP addresses:</p><p>tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:53 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 1915/dnsmasq<br />tcp 0 0 10.4.0.1:53 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 1915/dnsmasq<br />udp 0 0 127.0.0.1:53 0.0.0.0:* 1915/dnsmasq<br />udp 0 0 10.4.0.1:53 0.0.0.0:* 1915/dnsmasq<br />would you please help me where should I add the step two&nbsp; once i loged in as a root, or under which line in the script shuld i add this line please<br />&nbsp; /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --listen-address=127.0.0.1 --listen-address=10.4.0.1 $args &amp;&amp; {<br />also how do i add option nonwildcard 1 to the dnsmasq section of your /etc/config/dhcp file, and then restart dnsmasq with /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart.<br />cheers</p>									</div>

					<p>I am running BIND named on my WNDR3700 slaved to my slower-booting systems as one of my public-facing nameservers. I installed it as a &quot;package&quot; (bind-server, bind-libs, bind-dig are installed) and it can be started as a service using the LUCI-based web UI; System &gt; Startup</p><p>If you have enough memory, it is my preferred choice over MaraDNS for a variety of reasons, including slave operation and perhaps a bit better vetting if security due to its more widespread use.</p><p>If you stick with MaraDNS, you might want to check that Startup screen to see if you have the option to start it on boot there. I find it a lot easier to work through the UI when I can, rather than in the raw config files for OpenWRT-specific kinds of things.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>jeffster</strong> on 5 Mar 2013, 04:16)</p>
