					<p>Looks like this may be the most powerful Linksys router right now.&nbsp; Any hope of porting OpenWRT over?</p><p>From the dd-wrt forum:</p><p>&quot;The WRVS4400N is really fascinating. It is based on two SoCs from Star Semi (9109 + 9202, both ARM9 based), the Vitesse VSC7385 Gigabit and the Marvell TopDog draft-n WLAN chipset. According to the GPL sources the 9109 has access to 32 MB RAM and the 9202 to 64 MB RAM. </p><p><a href="http://www.starsemi.com.tw/vEng/product.php">http://www.starsemi.com.tw/vEng/product.php</a></p><p>Here are the internal photos from FCC:</p><p><a href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=691357&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/form … or_pdf=pdf</a></p>									</div>

					<p>It looks like an interesting device indeed. I would give a shot for it, if I would have one, as the two socs solutions sounds spiffy. Probably the hardest part would be getting wireless working, tho..</p>									</div>

					<p>Looked more into the sources. They look quite clean and it seems the 9109 handles wlan and is running with ramdisk, it has no access to the flash chip. So theoritically if we can&#039;t get the binary module running over a newer kernel, we can simply run the linksys kernel on that one and OpenWrt on the 9202 <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I see a lot of requests for open firmware for these WRVS4400N routers. </p><p>If a developer is interested in attempting a port of open-wrt to this device, please let me know. I recently had a chance to pick one up (used) and recalled seeing a few support polls for it over and dd-wrt. I went ahead and bought it, incase any of the developers are still interested in getting their hands on one.</p><p>If someone is interested, please let me know, and I&#039;ll ship it out to you as soon as possible.</p><p>It&#039;s a WRVS4400N v1 running 1.1.13 firmware. It seems to function as designed, with only the common issues of; slight high pitched whine, occasional dropping of wireless connections, and being a bit picky with ipsec tunnels. At the moment, it connects to my linux box fine, but does not connect to a windows 2k8 server at my buddies office. It also seems to work fine connecting to cisco equipment. </p><p>Also, this thing runs hot! I dunno if thats normal, as it&#039;s the only one I&#039;ve handled, but this thing well..it&#039;s hot. </p><p>Anyway, if any dev is at least partially serious about tinkering with one of these, or even just needs one for his desk, I&#039;d be happy to send it over as a thank you to the developers, and the community that supports them.</p><p>Let me know,<br />Chris</p>									</div>

					<p>The rougher runs fine once you update the firmware... I would still like to see WRT on it though... I had a WRT350n but it melted due to a fire, my rougher is innocent but bead... :-( It had WRT on it and it ran great!!!! My old 350n had a better range and faster w-ifi speed than the WRVS4400n... Im not so sure if I really like my new WRVS4400n... Pleas let me know if you guys come up with something... thx</p>									</div>
