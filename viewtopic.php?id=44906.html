					<p>I noticed that sometimes, sysupgrade may drop the current ssh session when it is in the process of killing off running daemons prior to flashing the binary file. This may result with a bricked device because flashing is interrupted when sysupgrade is killed along with the terminated ssh session.</p><p>Fortunately I&#039;m using a Netgear device with failsafe recovery, but is there a way to prevent the ssh session from being dropped by sysupgrade&#039;s daemon killing process?</p>									</div>

					<p>This is correct, if you close ssh session yourself. If connection terminates unexpectedly, running programs continue to run. Try yourself:<br />ssh to router using putty, ping <a href="http://www.google.cz">www.google.cz</a>, unplug cable, close putty. Now open putty and ssh to your router again. Run ps and you will see ping <a href="http://www.google.cz">www.google.cz</a> still running <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Btw I have sysupgraded about 20 devices multiple times, but if I experienced a brick, it had been because of my own stupidity <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /> I think there&#039;s no need to worry, it is taken care of, dropbear is killed by reboot, not during sysupgrade.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nozombian</strong> on 24 Jun 2013, 14:17)</p>
