					<p>1st I followed instructions for WDR3500 v1.3 flashing Chaos Calmer (15.05) and got Error 18005. Strangely I got same error with TP-Link latest FW (same as current) and one before. This was tried with Chrome, IE and Edge with same result Error 18005. Then in desperation I tried tftp (using solarwinds as well as tftpd64.exe), setting LAN fixed IP to 192.168.0.66/255.255.255.0, renaming image to &quot;wdr3500v1_tp_recovery.bin&quot; and pressing reset 7s or 3s or &gt;10s multiple times and it did not work. Simply router does not respond to tftpd no matter how I reboot it. <br />Some with other model TP-Link routers were <strong>suggesting 3 phase flash</strong>; to 1st flash dd-wrt, then older tp-link recovery image (assuming that it won&#039;t be locked) and then put openwrt. Few reported forum posts resulting in <strong>bricking</strong> tell me not risk with such procedure nor would recommend this to anyone. The only thing I did not try is hack with script in SSID to run script from USB thumb drive since it is for WDR710 (google it by &quot;tplink ssid script openwrt fcc lock&quot;).</p><p>I opened issue with TPLink support reminding them that FCC punished them $200K for misinterpreting FCC rules and forces them not to block FW update (you can google about this news all around internet).</p><p><strong>It seems that dd-wrt found a way supposedly to circumvent this (per dd-wrt forums), so can openwrt community address it too either copying same approach or new one? It could be something simple like country region bytes or copy fixed certificate, etc,..</strong></p><p>Please <strong><span class="bbu">HELP</span></strong> with <strong>how to solve this TP-Link FCC lock problem for good and enable all to put openwrt on WDR3500</strong> and in general all other locked TP-Link routers.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nomendos</strong> on 13 Apr 2017, 17:25)</p>

					<p>TPLink was kind enough to provide me with non US FW that I was able to put and then openwrt was not blocked anymore.<br />Problem solved.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>nomendos</strong> on 16 Apr 2017, 07:59)</p>
