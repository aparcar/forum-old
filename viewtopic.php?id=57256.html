					<p>Helo.</p><p>I have device with MT7620 and 32MB Flash. I whant to learn how to load complet system with OpenWRT. Rootfs maybe squashfs or ubifs. Other words I whant to create embedded system from 0 with OpenWRT, but I do not need concret frimeware. I found software here.</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>https://downloads.openwrt.org/latest/ramips/mt7620a/</code></pre></div><p>Ofcorse I also read this</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing</code></pre></div><p>and I find support for certian device here, and addiotionaly informations</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start</code></pre></div><p>If i connect to my device via UART i also get this menu</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>  1: Load system code to SDRAM via TFTP. 
  2: Load system code then write to Flash via TFTP. 
  3: Boot system code via Flash (default).
  4: Entr boot command line interface.
  7: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via Serial. 
  9: Load Boot Loader code then write to Flash via TFTP.</code></pre></div><p>So As You can se I have standartd choice to load system. But I do not find nothing about how to load kernel itself (openwrt-ramips-mt7620a-uImage.bin ) and how to load&nbsp; openwrt-ramips-mt7620a-root.squashfs, and how to set&nbsp; u-boot. Thats mean I do not know nothing about addres load uImage, addres load rootfs etc. <br />I think about similar solution to this</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/AM335x_U-Boot_User%27s_Guide#NAND</code></pre></div><p>As you see this is tutorial how to flashing uImage, rootfs etc. Now I need something similar&nbsp; to this in device with MT7620.<br /> I can add for example. In MCU Sitara so as load uImage from SD card i must use this command with u-boot layer</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>fatload mmc 0 0x80300000 uImage // load uImage to RAM memory
nand erase 0x280000 0x500000  // erasing space for uImage
nand write.i 0x80300000 0x280000 0x500000 // write uImage form RAM to NAND started for concret adress</code></pre></div><p>Then I have write kernel image on NAND. </p><p>So, How get similar result in MT7620 and OpenWRT ?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>EbdWRT</strong> on 9 May 2015, 18:05)</p>

					<p>Hmmm...So Houston, We&#039;ve Got a Problem...</p><p>I thought it is simple.&nbsp; Thats mean I download uImage with OpenWRT server, and ready squash file system, And the only thing I have to do, this is write in concret adress this things and vola...</p><p>Please tell me what a realy need, to this job. In this moment I understood this.<br />1. I need device tree basic liberary *.dtsi to MT7620 and SPL bootloader something similar to MLO file in TI ?<br />2. I need bootloader in this case this is U-Boot. I must set concret variables, compile them and flashing (in concret add) <br />3. I must compile kernel and add to them concret device tree<br />4. Now I can use OpenWRT distro with this file <strong>openwrt-ramips-mt7620a-root.squashfs</strong> and flashing in concret addres</p><p>Offcorse I need also cross compiler provided from MediaTek ?</p><p>I also understood that. This kernel:<br /><strong>openwrt-ramips-mt7620a-uImage.bin</strong><br />is not for me ?

Platform is MT7620 32MB Flash and 128Mb RAM. And On this platform I need to put complet system with OpenWRT distro. I can also add this. Platform is similar to <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asiarf/awm-evb">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asiarf/awm-evb</a><br />but I have&nbsp; more RAM however MCU is this same (AsiaRF AP2620).

					<p>First you need to see if the manufacturer&#039;s provided bootloader in the flash now&nbsp; is able to load third party firmware.&nbsp; This is usually the case.&nbsp; If it is not, and only if it is not, will you need to replace it.</p><p>If you use an initrd you tftp it to the start of the RAM (which is almost always 0x80000000) and jump to there to boot it.&nbsp; initrd has no file system in flash, there is only a RAM disk.&nbsp; It is suitable for one-time booting for test purposes.</p><p>A combined image has two parts more or less concated together:<br />Kernel -- lzma compressed.&nbsp; The bootloader extracts the whole kernel to RAM and it stays in RAM the whole time the box is running.<br />Squashfs -- permanent files.&nbsp; This is an immutable file system, once mounted the kernel reads files from it from flash as needed.<br />During the first boot, the remaining empty space in the flash after the squashfs is detected and formatted to be an empty jffs file system.</p><p>OpenWrt will usually automatically handle different RAM size than expected but needs to be re-compiled for larger flash.&nbsp; A pre-compiled release image may work with your 32M chip but only give 8 or 16M usable space.</p>									</div>

					<p>I know how to work initrams file system. I have experience with divice with initRAMS not initRD. However if initrams have works for me, he must be compile into kernel or as itself file *.cpio flashing. Then kernel after start load this archives to RAM.

					<p>See the wiki about Image Builder.&nbsp; Basically it works by downloading a pre-compiled set of packages and using them to create a custom image of the squashfs offline on a Linux PC.&nbsp; A pre-compiled kernel is added to make one image file that is ready to flash.</p><p>This is important mostly when the flash chip is small.&nbsp; With a large flash chip you needn&#039;t be as concerned about saving space by pre-squashing your install.</p>									</div>

					<p>What is Image Builder I know (I have experience with TI device). Maybe now I know what is Your idea. Your propozition is build one file kernel+squashfs for concret MCU.
