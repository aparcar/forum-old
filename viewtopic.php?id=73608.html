					<p>I&#039;ve used Google Wifi for a long time now (specifically, Asus OnHub central router + 3 Google Wifi mesh nodes) mostly because it&#039;s super easy, works well, and has just enough features for me to scrape by.</p><p>But lately I&#039;ve been wanting a more feature-filled router, and today I decided to go with a Linksys WRT1900ACS (I would have gone with the WRT3200whatever but I read that there were some ongoing issues with that one).</p><p>I haven&#039;t had a chance to start setting up, but I wanted to ask here if anyone has switched from Google Wifi to a WRT1900ACS or similarly specced router, and how you felt performance differed.</p><p>I have anywhere from 15-20 devices on my network at any given time. These include my phone, my tablet, several Google Homes, laptops, my home server, two game consoles, my Roomba, etc, operating on a 1000/50 home cable connection. Google Wifi handles this well enough - can I expect the same from my new router and OpenWRT?</p><p>Thanks</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>woof</strong> on 21 Mar 2018, 19:06)</p>
