					<p>Hello,<br />I screw up flashing my Arcadyan ARV752DPW aka easybox802. It doesn&#039;t boot brnboot nor u-boot.<br />So used uart and send u-boot to RAM. <br />but now u-boot doesn&#039;t support xmodem (loady/loadx/loadb command not recognised), it starts up webserver so I connected it to my laptop vie ehternet and set up ip and submask of my network card but browser can&#039;t connect to the webserver.<br />Tell me, am I doing something wrong? is there a way to transfer u-boot and openwrt to flash now?</p>									</div>

					<p>The U-boot images built as part of the OpenWRT build process usually support TFTP protocol. Have you tried the &#039;tftpboot&#039; command while in the bootloader environment? You can use this command to download binary images into the router&#039;s RAM memory from a TFTP server that is running on your laptop.</p><p>Then use these images to write a working U-boot into the router&#039;s flash memory and ensure it can boot correctly on power-on. Carry on with writing a suitable kernel image and a suitable rootfs image into the flash. Configure the U-boot environment so it finds and loads the kernel &amp; rootfs correctly.</p>									</div>
