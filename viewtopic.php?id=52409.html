					<p>So my little DLINK 300 A1 currently sits on software OpenWrt Backfire 10.03.1 / LuCI 0.10.0 Release (0.10.0). I can access Luci with no problem. I have configured the router as a repeater taking the second option in the following post (the easy option) <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077.">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39077.</a> So I have a working knowledge of Linux and VI so that wasn&#039;t really a challenge. When I look in Luci all the changes are done as per config files so very happy with that. Problem. The wireless light on my router is not on. Luci shows that wireless is enabled for both master and client and gives me the option to disable it but I also get message under both wireless master and client that wireless is disabled or not associated. So I know its not disabled and its kind of hard to associate if the wireless isn&#039;t working. Can anyone please give me some tips on this. Its my early days on openwrt but have used ddwrt for years (with this router and with working wireless) so I&#039;m not a total noob. Any help will be so appreciated</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fintanohalloran</strong> on 26 Aug 2014, 17:35)</p>

					<p>I guess this is an unusual circumstance. As such could someone advise in gentle steps how to revert to ddwrt on a dir300 A1. Ther are so many post on how to do this with not one of them working it is mindboggling</p>									</div>

					<p>That doesn&#039;t sound bitter, that sounds unreasonable. Barely half a day after not receiving an answer and you start lashing out at the whole community here. You are asking a very specific question which would require someone with the same model in the same circumstance to have made progress on your very specific problem. At least please be aware that some rather simple things like, let&#039;s say, timezones or a modicum of real life prevent people from checking in every hour.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>metai</strong> on 27 Aug 2014, 17:29)</p>
