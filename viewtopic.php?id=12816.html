					<p>Hey!</p><p>I&#039;m in a project where it&#039;s required that we retrive the wireless link state information from the broadcom driver. Specificly I need to calculate the SNR(Signal-to-noice ratio) of a given link. We&#039;re using the Linksys WRT54GL V1.1 router, with Kamikaze 7.07.&nbsp; Would anyone know where I can find a broadcom(BCM2050KML) API? Or just know how to get link information.</p><p>Thanks!<br />/Mikael</p>									</div>

					<p>Thanks for answering!</p><p>I need the SNR for each link that the router receieves a package from. So if the router is A and it receives a message from B, I need to calculate the SNR on the link between A and B.</p><p>IWSPY seems to have functionality that would allow this! I have been looking into iwconfigs source code to find something I could use there, and I&#039;ll look into iwspy as well at. The problems with it as I can tell (and I could very well be wrong) is that not all drivers respond to ioctl messages that are sent using iwspy or iwconfig, so the results may very upon driver, or am I wrong?</p><p>Tried running iwspy on the routers though, and it produced interesting results.</p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# iwspy wl0 00:12:F0:89:82:B8<br />Segmentation fault</p><p>Then trying to do the same thing again will crash the router and then it needs to be rebooted for proper use. It should be noted that I have done almost nothing with the router, other than install the firmware, and change the wl0 interface to be in ad-hoc mode. Oh, I should probably have mentioned that the project needs a adhoc environment, we need the SNR for every link that decides to join.</p><p>Running iwspy on my own laptop gave me another error, but that was easably solved with sudo <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" />. I wonder if the router error is something equaly simple, but if it is I haven&#039;t seen it.</p><p>As for ipkg install wl, here&#039;s the error (ofcourse there&#039;s a error.. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /> )<br />root@OpenWrt:~# ipkg update<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/brcm-2.4-2.4/packages/Packages">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/ … s/Packages</a><br />wget: server returned error: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found<br />Downloading <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/packages/mipsel/Packages">http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/p … l/Packages</a><br />Updated list of available packages in /usr/lib/ipkg/lists/packages<br />An error ocurred, return value: 1.<br />Collected errors:<br />ipkg_download: ERROR: Command failed with return value 1: `wget --passive-ftp&nbsp; &nbsp; -q -P /tmp/ipkg-rhwf9F <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/brcm-2.4-2.4/packages/Packages">http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/brcm-2.4-2.4/packages/Packages&#039;</a></p><p>root@OpenWrt:~# ipkg install wl<br />Nothing to be done<br />An error ocurred, return value: 4.<br />Collected errors:<br />Cannot find package wl.</p><p>.. and yes there&#039;s connectivity to the net:) Although I honestly can&#039;t tell how many firewalls I&#039;m behind, so that might be the problem with this. What is wl anyway?</p><p>I am very new to the everything about this, and I&#039;m trying to fill the gap of knowledge so if I ask something silly, please bear with me. </p><p>So anyway, I&#039;m very happy about any responce, and other ideas on how to go about retriving link information are very appricieated.</p><p>//Mikael</p>									</div>

					<p>The url shown is wrong, it should be brcm-2.4 (NOT brcm-2.4-2.4) edit your /etc/ipkg.conf and correct it.</p>									</div>
