					<p>Hi everybody,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;d like to ask some questions.</p><p>I&#039;m using an ADM5120 infineon board with linux from <br />buildroot (not openwrt), but it&#039;s somehow related. <br />I&#039;ve tried patches for kernel 2.6.12 from </p><p><a href="http://www.student.tue.nl/Q/t.f.a.wilms/adm5120/">http://www.student.tue.nl/Q/t.f.a.wilms/adm5120/</a></p><p>and also patches for kernels 2.6.21 from openwrt<br />project with 2.6.21 kernel.</p><p>My problem is, that I&#039;m still getting mchecks in<br />ebtables or zlib. I&#039;ve read somewhere, that this<br />problem is related to TLB but I&#039;m not sure what<br />can couse this problem or how to fix it. </p><p>When I switch of ebtables and bridging it behaves<br />more stable but sometime still crashes.</p><p>Which kernel versions are tested and stable on ADM5120??</p><p>Thanks a lot for Your help</p><p>Jakub</p>									</div>
