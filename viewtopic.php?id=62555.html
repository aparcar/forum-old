					<p>I flashed openwrt onto one of these dongles:</p><p><a href="https://wiki.hackerspace.pl/projects:zsun-wifi-card-reader">https://wiki.hackerspace.pl/projects:zs â€¦ ard-reader</a></p><p>and after the successful flash, it came up with the usual defaults and with the wireless SSID set to &quot;OpenWRT,&quot; no encryption.</p><p>So I logged into the luci console, set a root password, and then reconfig&#039;d the wireless to a different SSID with WPA2 encryption.&nbsp; After rebooting I see the new SSID, but cannot connect with the configured passphrase.&nbsp; Maybe I made a mistake in typing in the passphrase, but if not, I don&#039;t understand what is happening.</p><p>A reset won&#039;t be easy, I&#039;ll have to remove the plastic case to get at the pins, set up a serial connection, etc.</p><p>Any ideas for an alternate approach which is less drastic?</p><p>Fun gadget!</p>									</div>

					<p>Hey, thank you so much!</p><p>That worked, wifi got reset back to OpenWRT, so I was able to connect to the device again.</p><p>It&#039;s early days, but it seems as tho luci has some problems successfully configuring the device.&nbsp; I ssh&#039;ed to the device and editing /etc/config/wireless, hand-configured WPA2 wireless, which seems to be working upon reboot.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes, the rx trace is not connected to the pin row, i guess (zero ohm) resistor is missing? check the photos and the difference between v1 and you will find it near the cpu. I did find it.</p><p>And BTW I also had a bad flash and managed to recover via serial.There is no load command but I managed to poke the rootfs to RAM via python script using mm.l u-boot command. Took few hours to run but worked fine in the end:-)</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>fanoush</strong> on 23 Apr 2016, 22:28)</p>

					<p>Just want to say thanks very much to the people at hackerspace.pl. Bought one of these things <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_89_0?fst=as%3Aoff&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Azsun+wifi+memory+card+reader%2Cp_89%3Azsun&amp;keywords=zsun+wifi+memory+card+reader&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463535673&amp;rnid=2528832011">here</a>. Downloaded the firmware from <a href="https://owncloud.hackerspace.pl/index.php/s/7s5c5RDS7Njgwpv">here</a>. Flashed the firmware using the instructions from the <em>Flashing from original firmware (mtd_write)</em> section from <a href="https://wiki.hackerspace.pl/projects:zsun-wifi-card-reader#flashing">here</a>.</p><p>This is now my smallest OpenWrt system. You can put it on a key chain. Note that since this device only has WiFi. You are well served by setting up <a href="https://wiki.hackerspace.pl/projects:zsun-wifi-card-reader#flashing">extroot</a>. With&nbsp; <a href="https://wiki.hackerspace.pl/projects:zsun-wifi-card-reader#flashing">extroot</a>, you can easily recover from WiFi configuration errors by removing the microSD card and correcting the errors with a Linux PC text editor. Have mindlna, ftp server vsftp, gcc and many other packages loaded.</p>									</div>
