					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;ve spent the better part of 2 months fighting with OpenWRT in an attempt to set up a multi hop wireless link. I&#039;d really appreciate it if someone could confirm that what I want to do is possible.</p><p>I have 3 wireless routers:</p><p>The first router is a PC Engines WRAP 2C x86 board with 2 AR5413 cards on it.<br />One card provides ap services for the clients on the network. Clients use 2.4 GHz. The second card forms part of the multi hop wireless link. It uses 5.8 GHz. This works fine.</p><p>The second router is a Ubiquiti RouterStation with 2 AR5413 cards on it. One card talks to the first router while the other talks to the third router. Both use 5.8GHz on different channels. This has never worked successfully with 2 cards at the same time. I&#039;ve tried with and without WDS, with and without WPA2-PSK and using the ath5k and madwifi kernel modules.</p><p>The third router is a Ubiquiti RouterStation with 1 AR5413 card on it. It talks to the second router on a 5.8 GHz channel. This connects to a DSL line via a DSL modem in bridge mode.</p><p>I&#039;ve tried 10.03 (stable release) and 10.03.1-rc3 on all 3 routers, keeping the version the same throughout the network each time.</p><p>The cards are all Mikrotik R52 or R52H.</p><p>Can anyone confirm that using 2 Atheros cards on a Ubiquiti Routerstation at 5.8GHz works?</p><p>Thanks,</p>									</div>
