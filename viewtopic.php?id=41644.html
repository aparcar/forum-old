					<p>Hi,all:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recently,i installed openwrt (version:attitude adjustment r33444) to my router(tp-link 741nd v4),and set lan ip to 192.168.1.1 and wan ip to 192.168.2.1.When i ping 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.1.1 from wan direction ,it could both be successful!!!Also i ping 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.1.1 from lan1 direction,but i found that i can only ping 192.168.2.1 successfully.Other ports(lan2\lan3\lan4) are normal, and i can sure i haven&#039;t do anything else settings.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems like wan port and lan1 port have switched their functions.Anyone else can give help?Thanks!!!</p>									</div>
