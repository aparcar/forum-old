					<p>Hello</p><br /><p>I am new to OpenWRT (just installed as an alternative to DD-WRT on my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND). The problem is that i have 2 subnets, one for a vpn-server an the other one for my clients in my network:</p><br /><p>192.168.0.0/24 normal client-subnet (router hat 192.168.0.1)</p><p>10.0.0.0/24 f√ºr my vpn-clients (the vpn server running OpenVPN has 192.168.0.9)</p><p>when i connect to the OpenVPN server, i get an adress from it (as defined in its config, i.e. 10.0.8.6) and i get my DNS/DHCP config pushed (DNS-server 192.168.0.1, DHCP-Domain &#039;testsite.de&#039;), and any trafic is routed via the VPNs IP-adress 192.168.0.9 (the problem didn&#039;t exist in DD-WRT).</p><p>Using the DNS/OpenWRT i am able to resolve the hosts, but i cannot ping them or connect to them (i.e i have an apache rwebserver running at 192.168.0.20 and i cannot ping it or connect at port 80).</p><p>I have added the route to the subnet in my /etc/config/network: </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>config &#039;route&#039;
        option &#039;interface&#039; &#039;lan&#039;
        option &#039;target&#039; &#039;10.8.0.0&#039;
        option &#039;netmask&#039; &#039;255.255.255.0&#039;
        option &#039;gateway&#039; &#039;192.168.0.9&#039;</code></pre></div><p>Do i have to to something else, like changing config in /etc/config/firewall (i guess this is the problem, but i don&#039;t know what to change here)?</p><br /><p>Best regards</p><p>Thomas</p>									</div>

					<p>the problem is that your router know the route to the 10.8.0.x subnet, but your clients on 192.168.0.x don&#039;t. Forwarding within the same subnet will not work, and won&#039;t be performant either. <br />you have to push the route to 10.8.0.x to the clients in 192.168.0.x. They have to reach the other subnet directly through 192.168.0.9 and not redirected through the main router. Just push the route with dhcp to the clients in 192.168.0.x.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>eleon216</strong> on 27 Jul 2012, 00:42)</p>

					<p>can you tell me how i can achieve this via UCI?</p><p>I am thinking of a problem regarding the zones in OpenWRT, can this be it?</p><p>The zone &quot;lan&quot; is 192.168.0.0/24 and the router does know the Route to the subnet 10.0.0.0/24 which lies behind 192.168.0.9.</p><p>Don&#039;t i have to add a new zone (lets say &quot;lan2&quot;) to OpenWRT and define something in the firewall like &quot;in&quot; &quot;out&quot; and &quot;redirect&quot; &quot;accept&quot;?<br />I mean the clients in die 192 subnet keep sending the packets for everything which is not their local subnet through the default gateway (which is the router and it knows the route to the 10 subnet)??</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Thomymaster</strong> on 27 Jul 2012, 01:13)</p>

					<p>routing through the mainrouter will not work this way. <br />lets say the client 192.168.0.20 want to send a packet to 10.8.0.20 in the setup you want to make it has no route for this and sends it to the defaultgw 192.168.0.1 the gw has a route for 10.8.0.0/24 and sends it to 192.168.0.9 and this router sends it to its client. The problem is the returnpath. If the client 10.8.0.20 wants to send a packet back it will reach your vpn-server and there is the problem: the vpn-server sees the destination address 192.168.0.20 and has an interface in this subnet, so it will send the packet directly to 192.168.0.20. But 192.168.0.20 expects an answer from 192.168.0.1 not 192.168.0.9. And don&#039;t recognize it as reply to the original packet. So this won&#039;t work. <br />NAT-Reflection could make something like that possible, but I wouldn&#039;t go that road. </p><p>Your clients in 192.168.0.0/24 just need to know that they can reach 10.8.0.0/24 directly through 192.168.0.9 . you can add static routes on the clients, or just push it with dhcp. </p><p>I don&#039;t use uci normally but you just have to add one line to the dhcp config for lan in /etc/config/dhcp </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>list &#039;dhcp_option&#039; &#039;121,24.10.8.0.0,192.168.0.9&#039;</code></pre></div><p>this will push a classless-static-route to the clients. it&#039;s an odd syntax but 121 ist the dhcp option &quot;classless-static-route&quot; 24 is the netmask then comes the subnetaddress and the gw.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yeah but i have some clients which dont get their addresses via DHCP and in DD-WRT (i only set the static route to 10.0.8.0/24) it worked.</p>									</div>

					<p>ok... you have to add one line to the config file, and you have to add a static route on the clients with static IPs, and everything would work just fine, but it seems like you don&#039;t want to do this. </p><p>If you want to redirect traffic (for the same subnet) through the mainrouter, you need SNAT. Openwrt has implemented NAT-Reflection which basically is SNAT some time ago, so maybe this is something you could use. Or maybe it&#039;s possible to do this with a <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall#source.nat.snat">snat-directive</a> or you can definitly get something up and running with iptable-rules directly check this thread out: <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=109259">https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=109259</a><br />You would only need the first 2 iptables-rules and you would have to make some modifications, to use it for traffic to a subnet&nbsp; instead of traffic directed to the WAN-IP. But it is possible. </p><p>But it&#039;s not an elegant solution, might has performance issues, and it will have other drawbacks e.g. for the clients in 10.8.0.0/24 it will look like all requests will come from 192.168.0.1, so accesslogs will be useless, any IDS will fuck up, and will block all traffic, if one client act badly, ... <br />I guess this is a reason (besides dynamic WAN-IPs) why not even NAT-reflection was implemented in Openwrt for a long time. NAT is ugly enough but NAT-reflection make it even worse. But I guess the devs gave in after hundrets of &quot;but it works with the stockfirmware/dd-wrt/tomato,...&quot;-messages</p><p>Pushing routes with dhcp is working really well, and in my opinion it is the better approach, but if you really want to do this with SNAT, have fun with it, you probably will learn at lot. Good luck!</p>									</div>
