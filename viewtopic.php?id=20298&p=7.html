					<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have serious problems getting a serial connection to my WRT160NL. I got a CA-42 clone cable from ebay with a pl2303 in it. I tried the following wiring with no success:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Nokia Pin | Router Pin
6 - 2
7 - 3
8 - 5</code></pre></div><p>I used the following configuration with both Hyper Terminal and Putty:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Speed: 115200
Bits: 8
Stop Bits: 1
Parity: None
Flow Control: None</code></pre></div><p>Sometimes I get some cryptic text (but not very often). For two times I got appropriate router ouput but no input and only for a non soldered connection. </p><p>Do you have any idea what&#039;s going on? How likely is it that i damaged some ic on the pcb (I switched Nokia Pins 6 and 7 once)? The cable should be fine (I bought a second one in the meantime to be sure it&#039;s ok)</p><p>thanks for your help and best regards,<br />David</p>									</div>

					<p>Make sure your cable is short, like 18 inches or less.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe there is significant danger of damage just from getting pins wrong.&nbsp; Did you read back further in this thread?&nbsp; Back on page 2 at least my CA-42 the pins were what amounted to on the PCB end 2 (white), 4 ( blue) , and 6 (black).&nbsp; I traced them using a multimeter from the pin numbers on the connector to the PCB after cracking open the USB shell.&nbsp; In my case I had initial confusion that the Nokia POP-port cable the first visible pin is pin#2, the diagrammed pin#1 is not present and is way to left of the attachment clip.</p><p>My example seems twitchy that sometimes my PC doesn&#039;t even recognize the device or gives me baud rate eror or something.&nbsp; Then I unplug and replug the USB and it works fine.&nbsp; I dunno don&#039;t have a second one to test against.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 24 Aug 2009, 21:35)</p>

					<p>Hi Vincent,</p><p>thx for the fast answer. I just opened the connector of my CA-42 cable and assumed the Pins are in ascending order according to this link:<br /><a href="http://www.hardwarebook.info/Pop-Port">http://www.hardwarebook.info/Pop-Port</a></p><p>The Pins were not explicitly labelled but according to the above link i think the following interpretation *should* be correct shouldn&#039;t it? (white: Pin 6, green: Pin 7, gnd: Pin 8)<br /><a href="http://www.schmelly.de/files/screenshots.pdf">http://www.schmelly.de/files/screenshots.pdf</a></p><p>I just cut off the connector and connected the white, green and gnd cables to Pin 2, 3 and 5 on the Router (I didn&#039;t touch the usb shell). My cable is quite short at the moment (less than 12 inches). </p><br /><p>I hope this approach makes somewhat sense <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/roll.png" width="15" height="15" alt="roll" /></p>									</div>

					<p>I counted the first &quot;solderable&quot; Pin of the connector as Pin 2 already. If you take a look at my second photo this means the black wire is connected to Pin 3 (ACI, according to the diagram you linked) and the red one to Pin 4 (VOut). Pins 2, 5 and &gt;8 are not connected at all.</p><p>I opened the usb shell and as expected there is a label like &quot;V-DKU-5-0(V2.0)&quot; (It was a nightmare to open since everything was cast in plastic). The serial converter ic is a PL 2303HX. Unfortunately the actual solder joints are not labelled (everything else are smd parts). I can provide photos tomorrow as well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Specto, either you can read this thread and others and sort out how to buy a US $5 Nokia DKU-5 or CA-42 cable off EBay and connect up 3 wires or you cant.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t I wouldn&#039;t recommend playing around with flashing new firmwares that may brick your router.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you really can&#039;t fix it, then PM me and I will give you my address.&nbsp; You can mail me the router and $5 for the cable, and I&#039;ll volunteer to hook up serial for you and mail it back.</p><p>The Atheros platforms do not seem to have a rescue mode like TFTP boot_wait on the Broadcom platforms, so working serial console is essential tool if you are going to muck about with trunk firmware.&nbsp; With serial it&#039;s a matter of seconds to abort the boot and type &quot;upgrade code.bin&quot;, and within a couple of minutes all is well.</p>									</div>

					<p>Here&#039;s the board photos. Is J3 a serial header? I know that with solid telephone wire inserted into the holes of the Micro JTAG spot at J2 and into the corresponding spots on your JTAG cable will work nicely for a JTAG connection. The telephone wire fits the Micro JTAG holes perfectly.

					<p>Now that I&#039;ve attempted to compile I can answer my own question. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />Yes, what&#039;s in a generic build like dnsmasq, iptables, etc, seems to be selected. Must be set by the wrt160nl profile? <br />Not sure if luci is in there, it&#039;s still running make, 1h30mins on ubuntu 9.04 (in vmware) and its still going. I&#039;d imagine compiling straight from linux rather than a vm would be 2x as fast.</p>									</div>

					<p>The WRT160NL profile is needed for WiFi to work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond that I don&#039;t need luci and nearly everything can be added with opkg later.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see trying to cram everything into the original squashfs build if you have small flash but the WRT160NL has plenty so seems somewhat waste of time.</p>									</div>
