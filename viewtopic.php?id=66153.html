					<p>Greetings all, my first post here. I&#039;m trying to install OpenWrt on a Linksys RE1000 v2. It looks like DD-WRT can work with v1 (RE1000 v1) of this wireless repeater as described here: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=154741">http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=154741</a></p><p>The procedure used required changing the first 4 bytes of the DD-WRT firmware to &quot;RE1K&quot;, tricking the device to install it. However this trick does not work with the v2 version. Looking at the stock firmware for both versions, i can see that v1 has the &#039;RE1K&#039; in it&#039;s first 4 bytes but the v2 doesn&#039;t. Matter of fact, the v2 firmware doesn&#039;t seem to start with any readable text in it&#039;s first 4 bytes. How would one get around this? so i can install another 3rd party firmware.</p>									</div>

					<p>It&#039;s BCM5357B0 vs. RT6855E, totally different SoCs, different bootloaders, different firmware formats.</p>									</div>

					<p>would OpenWrt even work on the RT6855E if managed to flash it? I ask because i barely see any devices with such hardware.</p>									</div>
