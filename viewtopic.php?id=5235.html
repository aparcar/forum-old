					<p>I&#039;m fooling around with a WRT54GL and I had OpenWRT White Russion R4 on it. I attempted to use webif to downgrade to a Linksys version and something seems to have gone wrong. I waited 10 minutes and reset the power and now when I go to 192.168.1.1 I get redirected to the page like before (strange I shouldn&#039;t be on OpenWRT anymore) and the page comes up 404. I told it to erase the FS and the NVRAM. I was about to double check the setting with my telnet session but it kicked me out and now I can&#039;t telnet in.</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>									</div>

					<p>I can fix this by [b]Clearing the Dang Browser Cache![b]</p><p>I don&#039;t know when I fixed it but I force my browser to really reload the page and magically I have Linksys code. yes you can recover. Sorry for the false alarm. BTW, my other WRT has that other 3rd party code and I can&#039;t get it to fall back to Linksys code (nasty). I have to figure out how to get it off of that code and onto OpenWRT. If anyone has any suggestions I&#039;m all ears.</p>									</div>

					<p>Well it was a minor problem but I had thought I really messed things up (I bet the 1st downgrade worked fine). I now know better and I&#039;ve got a working box with RC5 (I had to do this for a book I&#039;m writing).</p>									</div>
