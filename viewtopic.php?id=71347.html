					<p>Hi,</p><p>I&#039;m using a Huawei LTE-stick which works fine on my Ubuntu-machine but seems to not work on OpenWrt.</p><p>What I found:<br />lsusb shows that the stick is recognized with the id 12d1:14dc. On my Ubuntu-PC the device initally connects via the id 12d1;1f01 (a CD-Rom) and then is switched to 12d1:14dc by the program usb-modeswitch. On OpenWrt the program is usbmode, this uses the file /etc/usb-mode.json for configuration. By removing the entry 12d1:1f01 in the json-file and then rebooting the stick will be recognized as Cd-Rom. So it looks like everything is OK (and I&#039;ve put the entry into the json-file again).</p><p>About the machine: it has an eth0 as a built-in device and in ifconfig an additional device is visible as eth1. But br-wan does not get an IP-address. The stick shows it&#039;s connected by the blue little led.</p><p>Do you need more information?</p><p>What can I do to make it work?</p><p>AugustQ</p>									</div>

					<p>Hi,</p><p>please excuse for being so late but I was busy in the last weeks.</p><p>OK, solved: to make this stick working you do need these packages: usb-modeswitch wwan</p><p>That&#039;s it, but you need both packages. Maybe you need to do some modifications in the network-file but nothing more.</p><p>Regards<br />AugustQ</p><p>PS: at least it worked for me here.</p>									</div>
