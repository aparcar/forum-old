					<p>I have a Cisco ASA-5506 as my front facing firewall and a few wrt1900&#039;s behind it, still trying to get a better feel for OWRT. The one thing I like about the ASA for my home network is the ease of setting ports with higher or lower security levels, so a lower interface cannot make contact with a higher level. The one thing I hate about it is going through the incredible hassle to buy a new license for it each year.</p><p>I&#039;m wondering if OpenWRT can do the same, have each port a seperate subnet and configure which ones are able to access or not access other subnets (if so, what might that be called), and if it can be trusted as well as the 5506 for a WAN facing firewall.</p><p>Any comments, opinions, etc... much appreciated.</p>									</div>

					<p>Yes if the hardware has a supported programmable switch then each port can be configured as a separate interface/subnet. It is done using VLANs. You can put each interface in its own firewall zone, and configure which zones are able to access or not access other zones.</p><p>A few useful wiki pages. (It can be configured in the GUI as well.)</p><p><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network/switch</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</a><br /><a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall">https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/firewall</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>mikma</strong> on 5 Nov 2016, 12:45)</p>
