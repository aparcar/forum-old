					<p>Hi,</p><p>I wonder if there is such an emulator to load any firmware. For instance, I have some U.S. Robotics 5461 WiFi Routers with a built-in USB 2.0 Printer Server port. The <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware">Table of Hardware</a> listed this device as <em>Untested</em>. Also, there is no posts/docs that I can read to give me a go signal to try flashing my unit with the OpenWRT and/or any open source WRT firmwares. I don&#039;t want to find out from a hard way that flashing the OpenWRT firmware will brick my U.S. Robotics 5461. I am hoping there is an emulator that will be able to load both the OpenWRT and the U.S. Robotics 5461 firmwares for a comparison in term of memory addressing used for the booting process, etc. Anyone?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>pap2boy</strong> on 15 Dec 2005, 02:41)</p>

					<p>I can easily make this JTAG cable. However, the problem with this approach is I really don&#039;t know which one is a serial port (No manual/post/doc/guide to show what a serial port look like on the board); however, this U.S. Robotics 5461 does come with a USB 2.0 port. Can this USB port be used instead of a serial port with a JTAG cable? Will connecting any PINs through a JTAG cable to a serial port of a computer won&#039;t damage the unit and will also reveal something before I proceed to flash my unit with the OpenWRT firmware?</p><p>Also, how does one go about to backup the original firmware? Can a copy of the original firmware downloaded from the U.S. Robotics site be good enough?</p>									</div>
