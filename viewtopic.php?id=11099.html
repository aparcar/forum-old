					<p>Is there some method to the madness of finding a GPIO location on a board?</p><p>I have been trying to figure out if GPIO 2 &amp; 3 are available on the WRTSL54GS board.</p><p>I&#039;ve turned on all GPIO 0 through 7 and then gone hunting with my voltmeter looking for signal. There are pairs of contacts near the CPU like RA9 and RA10 that look like they could be... but no.</p><p>I was thinking it would be great to find these apparently unused lines and use say GPIO 2 for a 1-Wire interface, and maybe GPIO 3 for something else.</p><p>I do find it a bit odd though there&#039;s a USB LED at LEDC11 that stays lit all the time with OpenWRT v0.9 and it&#039;s apparently not regulated by a GPIO line, something else has it locked on.....&nbsp; Perhaps this is one of my missing GPIO and it&#039;s been left high during initialization, or otherwise out of reach?&nbsp; *sigh*</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 9 Jun 2007, 11:26)</p>

					<p>Follow up to my own question.</p><p>I brute-forced my way through it with a script that toggle all GPIO on for 5 seconds then off for 2 seconds. Probing around with a voltmeter I eventually found them.&nbsp; I put the black lead into the GND of the serial port and poked at contacts with the red one.</p><p>The pattern seems to be look for open pairs of pins marked RA(number).&nbsp; In my case I found them at locations on the back of the board:</p><p>GPIO2=RA59<br />GPIO3=RA60</p>									</div>

					<p>If you look at the table here:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Hardware/Linksys/WRTSL54GS#head-072ae72e583bd9968b4d869cd1eca1ea5c612fb4">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Har â€¦ ea5c612fb4</a></p><p>You&#039;ll see at least pins 4 and 6 are already inputs.&nbsp; I have no idea if you can use pins that are normally output, as input instead. Most people doing this before, were just doing the SD-card mod so they only needed a single input pin and would hijack one of the existing ones.</p><p>Many other routers there&#039;s not a full map, always a couple unknown.&nbsp; I&#039;m pleased at just having found all of them on this model.</p><p>If you want some code examples, I suppose the mmc.c code would be the place to start.&nbsp; Or maybe look at the GPIO utility I used in the first place to find these points.&nbsp; I am not a developer so I can&#039;t help you much.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>vincentfox</strong> on 29 Jun 2007, 20:17)</p>

					<p>I think it might be useful to point out what GPIO stands for:&nbsp; General Purpose Input/Output<br />I have been thinking that the &quot;unfound&quot; GPIO ports are actually used as UARTs to drive the serial connection, does anyone know if this is the case, or if the Broadcom BCM5352 has dedicated UART pins?<br />Side question, can anyone explain Broadcom&#039;s rationale behind not releasing the datasheet for this chip?&nbsp; I absolutely don&#039;t understand why they don&#039;t want engineers to be able to get a hold of this and design systems using their chip.</p>									</div>
