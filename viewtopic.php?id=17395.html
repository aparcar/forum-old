					<p>Hello guys,</p><p>I have problem getting 3G started on boot with my WRT54G3G, running Kamikaze 7.09.</p><p>Here is what I want to accomplish:<br />Have 3G started at boot with a ALWAYS on profile. The reason I need this is to have the device started and I wont have physical access to start the connection when needed. So, basically I want an always on connection.</p><p>Here is the relevant sections of my config files:</p><p>/etc/config/network:<br /></p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>#### WAN configuration
config interface        wan
        option ifname   &quot;ppp0&quot;
        option proto    &quot;3g&quot;
        option device   /dev/usb/tts/0
        option apn      [removed]
        option ppp_redial persist
        option ppp_demand 1</code></pre></div><p>I would like to add that if I issue the command </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code> ifup wan</code></pre></div><p>the 3g interface comes up without a problem. The problem is that it does not come up during boot.</p><p>I am almost sure I am just missing something in the config files. <img src="https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/wink.png" width="15" height="15" alt="wink" /></p><p>Thanks in advance.<br />---Jaco</p>									</div>
