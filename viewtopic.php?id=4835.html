					<p>Hello, <br />I&#039;m newbie in Openwrt. I&#039;ve used linux, FreeBSD and MacOSX for some time now, but definitely not a developper. </p><p>Problem: <br />I can&#039;t get in my Buffalo WLA2-G54C AirStation via telnet using lan (or wlan). I think that Openwrt boots fine, because I can see a wireless network named openwrt. It&#039;s also possible to log into the wireless network. Can I telnet into openwrt using wireless connection (I&#039;ve tried no success)? </p><p>What I&#039;ve done:<br />1. I&#039;ve followed the instructions (I used TFTP method, TFTP is the one that comes in MacOSX): <br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Installing#head-18d4e82baa92fee997e80cd924441606a236faf9">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Ins … 06a236faf9</a><br />and I didn&#039;t believe the warning: &quot;Does not work on the Buffalo WLA2-G54C. The boot loader keeps the ip set before uploading OpenWrt so was able to TFTP the Buffalo firmware back after removing the relevant parts in a hex editor.&quot; (so could some one tell me howto do the TFTP)</p><p>I used a image from:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/newest/bin/openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx">http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussi … uashfs.trx</a></p><p>2. I&#039;ve tried to boot in failsafe:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting#head-ea8da2ae4781dee2abc4e642a2410735c155b71a">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Tro … 35c155b71a</a><br />no success </p><p>3. I&#039;ve tried reflashing:<br />I believe the boot_wait is on (I haven&#039;t changed it), but I can&#039;t even ping in to the box.</p><p>ping: wrote 192.168.1.1 64 chars, ret=-1<br />ping: sendto: Host is down</p><p>ping: sendto: Host is down<br />ping: wrote 192.168.11.100 64 chars, ret=-1</p><p>4. I even tried shorting pins (I know it&#039;s not preferable method):<br /><a href="http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net:81/redhat/wrt54g_revival.html">http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net:81/redhat … vival.html</a> <br />The flash looked close enough same so I connected pins 15 and 16, nothing happend. Here is the ping to both addresses while I was booting with pins connected</p><p>ping: wrote 192.168.1.1 64 chars, ret=-1<br />ping: sendto: No route to host<br />ping: wrote 192.168.1.1 64 chars, ret=-1<br />ping: sendto: Host is down</p><p>ping: wrote 192.168.11.100 64 chars, ret=-1<br />ping: sendto: No route to host<br />ping: wrote 192.168.11.100 64 chars, ret=-1<br />ping: sendto: Host is down</p><p>I don&#039;t know which one is the right ip address. Buffalo&#039;s default is 192.168.11.100, and if I&#039;m correct the Openwrt sets the ip address to 192.168.1.1.</p><p>Update: I tried to connect pin number 16 to antenna (ground). That froze the booting until I removed the paper clip, still no response to ping. </p><p>I&#039;ve also pushed the reset button many times while booting and while I&#039;m not 2 seconds and sometimes even 15 seconds. </p><p>Moreover, I found this post: <br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4269">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4269</a><br />and I&#039;m willing to test if these sources solves my problem:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/</a></p><p>The difference to earlier post is that I don&#039;t have a serial port.</p><p>5. Now I&#039;m considering a JTAG cable:<br /><a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Troubleshooting#head-2905e5d0dd7320ac475dd4aa53c0c4ea93ffbadd">http://wiki.openwrt.org/OpenWrtDocs/Tro … ea93ffbadd</a><br />Anyone have any ideas, where to find router JTAG scheme (howto connect pins) for Buffalo?</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>teroartotapio</strong> on 17 Mar 2006, 10:01)</p>

					<p>Solved the problem by myself. </p><p>Member 5t3v3 comment in <br /><a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4311">http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=4311</a><br />mentioned shorting pins 5-6 instead of 15-16. This worked for me and I flashed this firmware:<br /><a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/nbd/whiterussian/</a></p><p>I can give specs from my router (and update supported harware section), if someone tells me howto do it or can point out the &quot;perfect&quot; example.</p>									</div>
