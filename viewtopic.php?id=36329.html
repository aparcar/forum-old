					<p>Hi foolks,</p><p>I am in charge of doing some QoS tests inside a mesh network but I just can not execute any TC command. First, I was having the &quot;RTNETLINK answers: No such file or directory&quot; error. But, after I loaded all modules the following is happening:</p><p>lsmod | grep sch</p><p>sch_teql&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5520&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_ingress&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 880&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_hfsc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;14592&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_tbf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3440&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_red&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3552&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_prio&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3184&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_gred&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6384&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_dsmark&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3664&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_sfq&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4496&nbsp; 0 <br />sch_htb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12976&nbsp; 0</p><p>lsmod | grep queue</p><p>&quot;Nothing returns&quot;</p><p>tc qdisc del dev wlan0 root</p><p>RTNETLINK answers: No such file or directory</p><p>tc qdisc add dev wlan0 root handle 1:0 htb default 3</p><p>After the last command the router just rebooted and it is happening all the time. I don&#039;t know what to do since I am really new in openwrt and tc.</p><p>So, anybody could help me?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Igor.</p>									</div>

					<p>Are you absolutely sure that &quot;kmod-sched&quot; fits exactly to your running kernel?<br />Crashes like yours usually happen if a kmod is used which was compiled against a kernel with a different featureset, this causes slight abi mismatches which usually lead to bad memory accesses as soon as one tries to actually use the corresponding module.</p>									</div>

					<p>Thak you all for the fast reply.</p><p>Orca, I did exactly what the wiki says for the installation and config process. I&#039;ve loaded all modules sch available but the router reboots after a tc qdisc add command.</p><p>Jow, the version of kmod_sched is: 2.6.32.27-1 and the kernel is: 2.6.32.27</p><p>So, taking the versions into account I suppose that kmod_sched fits to my kernel. Am I worng?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Igor.</p>									</div>
