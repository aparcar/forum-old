					<p>(posting some ideas that came out of some internal discussions last week)</p><p><strong>mini_fo</strong><br />The mini_fo is a small (96k) filesystem overlay module that combines two filesystems into a new virtual filesystem. This would replace the current method of symlinking the jffs2 partition to squashfs, which currenly takes around 350k of space on the jffs2 partition. The net effect is the following:<br />/ (mini_fo)<br />/rom (squashfs)<br />/jffs (jffs2)<br />The jffs2 filesystem will only contain files that have changed from the squashfs counterparts; no more symlinks. Note: mini_fo will not check if the new file is identical to the squashfs file; there needs to be a mechanism to correct this.</p><p>A partial set of patches: <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/mbm/mini_fo.patch">http://downloads.openwrt.org/people/mbm/mini_fo.patch</a></p><p><strong>Backing up jffs2</strong><br />The squashfs images contain a &quot;dirty flag&quot; in the firmware images which trigger an automatic reformatting of the jffs2 filesystem; this is done to ensure filesystem integrity after an upgrade since the jffs2 filesystem resides immediately after squashfs and may become corrupted or otherwise invalidated by the upgrade process. (partially overwritten by a larger squashfs, missing or broken symlinks due to squashfs changes, config files in old formats nolonger usable by the current set of applications)</p><p>Prior to erasing the jffs2 partition, we can attempt to mount it and dump any data we find onto a ramdisk/tmpfs. The data recovered may be incomplete, obsolete or corrupted by the reflashing process, so it&#039;s unlikely that we would simply write the data back to the jffs2 partition after reformatting it, but preserving the data and making it available to the user may become part of a last ditch effort for users who didn&#039;t read the upgrade warnings in the manual.</p>									</div>

It&#039;s just a couple of lines and they would do miracles on 2MB flash devices... (saving cca 256k of jffs2 overhead)</p>									</div>

					<p>i agree that backing up from the webif is probably the best route for saving users. However, there still is the problem that, typically, those standard backup scripts are written for environments where everything is input via the webif. That makes it easy to backup the config. I&#039;ve been trying to figure out a way to backup all files that will get written over and that we want to keep and send directly to an external source (so inadequate space on the router isn&#039;t a problem), but haven&#039;t gotten all the way there. My hope is to just have a list of parameters at the top, and that will take care of everything.</p><p>is mini_fo like unionfs, only mini?</p>									</div>

					<p>To my experimence mini_fo is somewhat unreliable. Especially when deleting files. Have seen once a vanishing directory, partly repaired by a reboot. May or may not caused by optimization - kicked off all ASSERT()s / kprint()s for unbloating. For this reason, I recommend an nvram option for old-style-symlinks in preinit.</p><p>As for the TFTP-Reflash-Detection. Talked once to nbd about this. Want to offer the squashfs for (re-)download via web UI - but this feature changes the CRC. nbd says there is an unused bit in the trx header worth investigation as a better place for this flag. Also: I don&#039;t think a backup feature for the jffs2 is really necessary. If someone does a TFTP upload (s)he *wants* the thing clean.

					<p>is the reason you want the ro squash is to be protected from damaging the core fs and not being able to boot? i understand this, but i think a fully jffs that you can backup, uninstall pre-installed packages, and upgrade from version to version would be REALLY nice.

					<p>SquashFS also has a large compression advantage over JFFS2.&nbsp; While this may not be much of an issue on 8MB and USB capable routers, on 4MB flash routers this makes a huge difference. With the default RC5 SquashFS image, w/ NAS, OpenSwan, OpenNTPd, and TCPDump tacked on, the packages and dependancies leave me with ~300KB free on the JFFS2 partition on a WRT54G.&nbsp; With a pure JFFS2 filesystem I would not be able to have all of these packages.&nbsp; Once I flash my customized WhiteRussian SVN image over with all those packages in the SquashFS partition, and mini_fo enabled, I should see a large increase in free space.</p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Bartman007</strong> on 27 Apr 2006, 09:55)</p>
