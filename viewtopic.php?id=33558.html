					<p>I&#039;ve created a package for OpenWRT that provides the latest ISC DHCP suite complete with (optional) IPv6 capabilities, should you so desire it.</p><p>Obviously this is quite a heavy-duty package and really *not* suitable for anyone who only requires very simple DHCP features; the server package alone weighs in at around 500Kb for MIPS and in essence, is basically suited to people who are familiar with it.</p><p>If you are one such person who also happens to have enough free space to try it, please do - bear in mind that of course, cooking the package into a flash image will always consume less space than putting it in jffs2 post-install.</p><p><a href="http://wikisend.com/download/946124/isc-dhcp-4.2.3-P1-openwrt.tar.gz">http://wikisend.com/download/946124/isc â€¦ wrt.tar.gz</a></p>											<p class="post-edited">(Last edited by <strong>Olipro</strong> on 17 Dec 2011, 22:14)</p>
